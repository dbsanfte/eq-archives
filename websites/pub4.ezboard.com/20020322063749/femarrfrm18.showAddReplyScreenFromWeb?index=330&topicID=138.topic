Yes, you are correct to some extent. I apologize Lukaria. You are not deserving my flames. I can admit that I have a deep seated hatred of non-rational religious responses. When I read such responses I do go overboard.   <p>Lurikeen Mali'Kyre<BR>

<br>
I would say, Triff, that forgiveness for my sins does not equal immorality, nor is there a relief of responsibility at all.  <br>
<br>
Lets discuss that further.<br>
<br>
A great place to read about this is Corinthians beginning in Chapter 5 (if you have access to a bible you can read this yourself, read through chapter 7).  This section is written by Paul, whom many probably know was a murderer.  He became a Christian and was forgiven his sins.  It is written to the Corinthians, who are believers and have been saved, but they are leading horridly immoral lives.  Paul tells them that though lawful to him, not all things are profitable.  He also tells them not to judge those outside of the faith, but we can judge those within the faith i.e. if someone is an immoral Christian and will not repent, and will not give up that which is immoral, he can be removed from the fellowship of the church. <br>
<br>
So, point one.  All things are lawful but not all things are profitable.<br>
<br>
Here is what is at the heart of your question.  When you accept Christ into your heart, you are &quot;born again&quot; so to speak into the Christian life.  Your sins are erased forever, as they have been paid by Christ himself .  In the bible, it says that those who have been born again no longer are &quot;under the law.&quot;  Now, basically what this means is that we no longer live under the yoke of making sacrifice/penance to God in order to atone for our sins.  i.e. when you sinned in the old testament, you made a sacrifice to God to atone for it (you killed a lamb or something ).  Jesus though is the ultimate sacrifice.  His sacrifice, of his own life for us, has paid the debt for all time. <br>
<br>
Not being under the law means that the old testament sins, for example, do not apply to us in relation to <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> God’s view of us</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.  This means that’s though we need to obey God and live a moral life, we invariably will fall short and sin, but that will not be held against us.  It does not change our standing in God’s eyes if we are “saved.”  Not being under the law means that even though we sin, if we ask forgiveness, we shall not be held accountable for those sins on our day of judgment because <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Jesus has already done that - he has taken all the sins upon Himself for us</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.  When we stand before God, our sins already will have been atoned for.  <br>
<br>
Does this mean that I could for example - have an affair?  Sure I suppose it could.  I would be forgiven for it, technically speaking - it would not bar my path to Heaven ultimately.  But I know that is wrong and is immoral.  Doing so would not only likely destroy much of my marriage (which is newly back together) and rip my family apart, but would also create huge feelings of guilt and self-hatred within me, and impede my spiritual growth.  This is NOT a profitable life to lead.  So though it might be lawful, it is not profitable.  In other words, Paul says, you'd be saved still if you did this, but you'd ruin your life - so why do it?<br>
<br>
This brings up the second point:  the Church could judge me.  If I had an affair and continued to have an affair and lead an immoral life, and I refused to repent after repeated attempts by the church to help me, the church could actually judge me and kick me out, thereby refusing me the fellowship of other Christians.  It is within their right to do so.  That doesn't mean the church will judge, but that they can judge, because I am a believer in Christ.  If I was not a believer, they would have no basis for judging me.<br>
<br>
Also consider the following points:<br>
<br>
God reads your heart.  Do you honestly think that God could not penetrate your heart and see if you are really sincere when asking him into your life?  If a murderer asks God into His heart, but with only an outward show of piety and an inward calculation (&quot;Gee, let me ask God into my heart and then I'll still go to heaven even though I've murdered 100 people), God WILL see that.  You must be sincere.<br>
<br>
Also consider this : once you sincerely ask God into your life, the Holy Spirit then becomes a guiding force in your life.  Yes, you can ignore it, but its very hard.  That is why so many people who honestly pursue relationships with God have so many wonderful changes in their lives.    <br>
<br>
This is not to say that we (Christians) never sin.  In fact, we do sin.  Just like everyone else on this earth, I am still a human with all that fallen nature implies (carnal and otherwise).  I still fall far short of perfection.  That’s why Christians should be the LAST people to judge others (non-believers), we know though, that often is not the case.  I feel that it is not my role to judge, that is God's role.  It is my job to become as much like Christ as I can, full of love and serving my fellow man, and spreading the good news.  <br>
<br>
That should answer your questions about moral responsibility, I hope.<br>
<br>
Now to the last part.  Why is forgiveness required.  Forgiveness is required in two different phases.  In this life, forgiveness is required in order to have a relationship with God.  God is a righteous being, and we cannot have contact with Him unless our sins are “made right” or atoned for.  In the next life, forgiveness of sins is required in order to dwell in heaven with God.  Again, He is a righteous and Holy being and will NOT allow evil into Heaven.  Your sins must be atoned for in order for you to be allowed in.  Sins, in God’s eyes are evil and a sinful person will not be allowed into contact with him or allowed to dwell in heaven with him.  Jesus, by being the ultimate sacrifice, atoned for ALL our sins for all time.  All you have to do is ask him into your heart and believe he did indeed die for your sins.  When God looks at me, Jesus stands there and takes all my sins onto Himself, so that God sees a righteous person.  <br>
<br>
Now, as to is this a big selling point.  You’d think it would be, wouldn’t you?  The thing is, when you talk like I have above most people think you’re crazy, that you are a religious fanatic, they see you as uncool, a weirdo, a freak.  First off, to them it sounds like mumbo jumbo, obviously you have to study the bible and really get into the word so that you can understand it.  The bible is not light reading.  Secondly, it sounds too good to be true.  They look at me and say “ you mean all I have to do is believe Jesus died for my sins, and sincerely ask God into my heart, and all my sins are forgiven?”  The answer is yep.  And it sounds too good for them.  Why would Jesus do that for them?  Where is the catch?  The answer is simple.  There is no catch.  Its free.  And God did it because He loves you, and wants you with Him.<br>
<br>
So, I hope I’ve done well.  I am sure I got a few things wrong here and there, but I certainly hope you were able to read and understand what I wrote.  Like I said,  a lot of people will think its total mumbo jumbo.<br>
<br>
If you have serious further questions regarding this, why don’t you email me? Lukaria@hotmail.com.  It is much easier to discuss over email than in a message board forum.  Its also easier for me to add links to pertinent information, and/or refer to someone more knowledgeable.<br>
<br>
I also must caution – I am by not means an expert.  I think I got all this correct.  Also, remember that many people, even Christians would disagree with me on a few points.  This is all simply my opinion from study and discussion.  A mature Christian of 20 years would probably be a better person to answer you.  In addition, I want to assure you I don’t intend to come across as arrogant or pompous or all-knowing or holier than thou.  If I do at all, it assuredly is an honest mistake and I apologize.  I simply find discussion of this quite intriguing and am delighted to be able share my love for God and the gospel.<br>
<br>
Have a terrific day.<br>
<br>
Luky<br>
