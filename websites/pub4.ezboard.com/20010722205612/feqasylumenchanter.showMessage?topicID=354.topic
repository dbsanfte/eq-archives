This one should be a pretty interactive topic, since we all do things slightly different.  Again, i am encouraging everyone to speak up with feedback.<br>
<br>
Also, i dont want people thinking i am trying to lecture them.  I am trying to create dialog, and also get some information out to some of our younger lanys enchanters who might be &quot;lurking&quot; but not posting on our boards.  I really like to think that Lanys enchanters are some of the best ( if not the best ) around, and only by sharing info will we remain that way.<br>
<br>
Todays topic is &quot;managing your group&quot;.  Elder enchanters know that enchanters tend to become the &quot;defacto&quot; leaders of a group, along with the group puller.  It is these two individuals that control the flow of mobs the the group, and also indirectly the speed at which the group kills.  I would like to talk about some of the things &quot;I&quot; do in groups to help them be more efficient.  Please keep in mind that none of this is &quot; right&quot; or &quot;wrong&quot; but, it is how i like to do things, generally.<br>
<br>
1) When you enter a group, the first thing you should do ( after saying hello ), is cast clarity on your Healers / Buffers, then follow with clarity on your intell caster types, then your hybrids.<br>
<br>
Why ?  first, the very first thing these people will say to you is &quot; enchanter ? whoot clarity !&quot;, and they will tell you they dont have clarity if you dont start casting it in .5 seconds from joining the group.  Second, do the healer / buffer classes first, so THEY may get on with the business of buffing YOU ( and the rest of the group ).<br>
<br>
2) Identify who the main assist is.  You can generally tell how &quot; with it&quot; your group is by how fast they answer this question ( at lower levels ).  A statemnt like &quot; hiya how is everyone, thanks for the group invite !.. btw-- who is the main assist ?&quot; works.  While you are saying this, you should be casting clarity ( see point 1 above ).<br>
<br>
3) make sure you have all your appropriate self buffs on.  At the very least, you should have your personal shielding spell, and clarity.  Those are a given.  More than likely, you will also have your best Cha buff on, as well.  Any other self buffs are up to you. I keep Group Resist Magic on at all times, even while travelling.  I like to use AoE mezz on occasion, so i want my MR as high as possible.  please see &quot;Goshans topic of the day - AoE mezz&quot; for more information on this spell line.<br>
<br>
4) Haste your tanks.  This assumes you just joined the group, and they were waiting for you.    If Buffing yourself, Casting clarity on a heavy mana using group ( hybrid tanks, int casters etc ) and Hasting all your tanks will take you below 40m DONT haste all the tanks.. haste the main tank, and the rogue if you have one.  Tell the others you will get them as mana permits.  if you can squeeze all the buffs in and have 40 mana, then do so.<br>
<br>
5) BEFORE you move to your camp spot ( assuming dungeon hunting ), CHECK YOUR BUFF SCREEN.  At the very least you should have a couple buffs from your healer / buffers, depending on what class they are.  If you have a cleric, you should have :<br>
<br>
A buff from the Clerics Resolution Line ( HP / AC )<br>
A buff from the clerics Armor of Faith Line ( AC) <br>
<br>
If the group is a 50+ group, you should also have :<br>
<br>
A Buff from the cleric symbol line ( please note, it is not ALWAYS necessary to have the clerics best symbol.  Sometimes the cleric cant afford it, and some times the camp doesnt warrant it.  If you want to make sure you always get symbols, YOU should be prepared to carry the appropriate stones around as well to give to them.  IN the higher end game this is not necessary, as clerics get reimbursed out of the group funds for casting these spells.  If your cleric is using jasper symbols on you, make sure they are not getting all the gems in a 50+ group though ).<br>
<br>
If you have a Druid, make sure to get Skin Like ( XXX), provided there is no cleric around.<br>
<br>
If all you have is a shaman, DONT get their talisman line.  Only get Their AGI and STA buffs.  Their Talisman line doesnt stack with shielding series, and good shaman will know this by the time they can cast this line of spells.<br>
<br>
DONT proceed to your camp spot untill you feel comfortable with the status of your buffs, AND the status of your mana.  This doesnt mean you should buff everyone and med to full ( lord knows they wont give you that much time if the group is ready to go ), but, dont buff everyone and leave yourself 20 mana and then proceed to camp either.  Buff down to 40m, then med back to 50 or 60m.  DONT LET THEM RUSH YOU if your not ready.  Medding from 40m to 60 m will take 1-2 extra minutes.  That time is worth it if you have to stop trains right away.<br>
<br>
Now... your group is buffed, you are 60m, and you start moving to your camp spot.  If you are not actively mezzing mobs, you should be medding.  Your goal is to med back as close to full as you can while your group is progressing toward your camp spot.<br>
<br>
Listen to how much mana your cleric has.  It is YOUR job to help control mana flow from the cleric, and yourself, so that both of you are close to the same amount of mana.  it is BAD if the cleric is 90m + all the time because you are slowing every mob, and chain stunning, and you are constantly 30m and struggling to buff / crowd control.  It is also BAD if the reverse is true, and you are FM and your cleric is at 30m all the time.  here are some tips..<br>
<br>
If you have more mana than your cleric, slow every mob for a bit, and chain stun a mob or 2 so they do almost no damage to your tanks.  Your cleric will get almost un interrupted med time, and you will burn some of the mana you have.<br>
<br>
If the cleric has more mana than you, and they pull a sinlge mob, DONT slow it.  let it beat on the tank and save yourself the slow mana, ( and get some extra med time ), Your cleric will have to burn a little mana to heal the main tank, and you will balance mana.<br>
<br>
Your at camp, now what ?<br>
<br>
After you get to camp ( and break the room in one of those exciting &quot;enchanter moments &quot;), you settle into the routine of grinding experience.  your puller will begin pulling mobs based on how fast you are killing them ( hopefully, if they are good ) and make sure that just as you are killing one mob, they are bringing another.  If you are in a good group, you will have at least one mob in camp for the next several hours.  This means you need to space your buffs.  Remember , you buffed everyone with everything when you joined the group and it will ALL drop at the same time.  You need to space them out so they drop about 5 min apart, not all at once.  This is sort of more work for you, because you will basicially be buffing or crowd controlling constantly for the next several hours, but it is the only way to keep up.<br>
<br>
The best way to space buffs is to NEVER sit at fm.  When you break the camp, and are starting pulls, if you are 80m+ go ahead and refresh clarity.  I know it hasnt dropped yet, but , this saves those tells of ( clarity fade ) in the middle of trying to control 5 mobs.  5 minutes after you refresh clarity, refresh Resist magic ( or Group resist magic ).  5 minutes after that, refresh the haste on your tanks.  Whenever you find yourself with a surplus of mana , refresh some buffs on either yourself, or your group.  <br>
<br>
Keep a clock by the side of your computer if you need to, to keep track of how long your mezzes are going to last.  I time buffs by casting them on myself first ( except for haste ), then casting on the people to be buffed.  I dont time haste this way because it is simply too mana intensive, and you need to keep a mana reserve for crowd control.<br>
<br>
If you manage to balance this all correctly, you will very rarely have to tell your group ( OOM  !), unless you have to perform a miracle save.  You MUST always keep mana for these &quot;miracle saves&quot;.  That is what you are there for.  Enchanters in most dungeons are saftey nets.<br>
<br>
This is another one of my long posts, but if i emphasize one thing it would be to make sure you balance your mana with your healers mana, to keep your group opperating at peak efficiency.  If you are killing things too slow, consider charming a mob to use as a pet to aid in damage.  If your group is mowing through mobs, it is better you dont charm a mob and disrupt the flow of exp to your yellow bar.<br>

I have a few comments though <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
For pre-camp buffing, it will often help you get started quicker if you offer to handle AC buffs instead of the cleric at least for the 1st buff round, using something like Umbra. Cleric AC buffs are *extremely* mana intensive, and for a full buffing round a cleric will run out of mana real fast. Just for comparison, my lower level cleric alt (lvl 40) takes 440 mana to fully buff each member in a group, with AC/Skin/Symbol lines of buffs, and thats at lvl 40. The AC line alone takes almost half of this mana. The lvl 49 ac buff Shield of Words takes a full 300 mana for a single buff, or about the same as your lvl 60 haste buff Visions of Grandeur (a bit more actually)... So AC buffs alone costs the cleric 1800 mana, add to this 420 for heroic bond and 1890 for best symbol, you have a cleric who's OOM twice over. If you can cover AC buffs for a bit, you're helping him out a LOT, and get started a lot faster <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  And though Umbra isn't as good as Shield of Words, it *is* a decent buff. And a whole lot cheaper.<br>
<br>
If the puller is a hybrid, clarity is simply a must for him. He will be the only caster in the group who *never* has any time to med, so he should be a high priority on your clarity list. Especially if he's also responsible for keeping up several buffs, such as rangers are often called upon to do (shameless self plug). Indeed, for most grouping situations that involve a ranger, he should be considered one of the buffers on equal terms with clerics, shamans and druids. If anyone wants me to elaborate on this, I will, but it'll get long so I wont do it right here. Resist magic is a must for the puller at the very least in any group, and of course for yourself. I can't count the times I've seen the message &quot;you resist Ensnaring Roots&quot; or &quot;you resist Tagars Insects&quot; and others while bringing a pull back. There are many casting mobs out there, and they always like to root the puller or something similarly nasty if he doesn't have the magic resistance to avoid it. Being rooted as a puller is not fun by the way <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  On the other hand, if you are running low on mana and have to choose who to haste, you can get away with leaving the puller out of the buff round. He'll be off pulling a lot of the time anyway rather than fighting, so it is not too great a loss of damage.<br>
<br>
About moving to the camp spot. Always wait for the puller to give the go ahead before you start moving, i've seen countless groups get wiped out or forced to pull a huge train to the nearest zone because someone who was *not* the puller decided it was time to move. For any and all decisions regarding movement, the pullers word is law. Before moving, a puller will clear out any static mobs and roamers on the way to the camp spot, or to a resting place in between where you can pull more mobs, to eventually get there. Rushing ahead without clearing out the area first will make your life as an enchanter a bit too exciting for comfort. It is seen everywhere, even in such easy dungeons as Karnors Castle, where the left moat group decides to take LCY and then promtly runs there without even considering that there might be 9 mobs in the way. If the try to do this, stop them, and let the puller do his job. Being in a hurry when moving is bad, a move needs to be controlled and well thought out. Ideally in this way, you will not have to fight anything until pulls begin at your new camp spot, except in instances where a regular break of the camp is required (monks, SKs or harmony usally mean it isn't, but they're not always available).<br>
<br>
About slowing mobs and mana levels... yep, totally agreed. It happens to be a pet peeve of mine when people just slow *everything* leaving them at low mana while the cleric never has to heal. <br>
<br>
A few things before I finish: Request of your puller to let you know if he's about to pull a big one, nothing like being prepared rather than suddenly seeing 5 mobs in camp. A good puller will do this without being asked, but not all pullers are good. Oh yes, and always keep enough mana for a miracle save, for when pullers like myself need to hit the social hotkey labeled &quot;O FUCK&quot;... (&quot;/g Oh shit... ready for a BIG one?&quot; followed by one of two others in my case... &quot;/g Incoming lots&quot; if the group is ready, or &quot;/g Going down, dont heal me&quot; to make sure the healers don't heal me if I have to eat it. And yes, I really do have those hotkeys, don't have time to type in situations like that <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> )<br>
<br>
PS. Some puller codes for number of mobs incoming that i've run into from many different people: &quot;1&quot; is a single mob, &quot;a few&quot; is 2 or 3, &quot;several&quot; is up to 5, &quot;lots&quot; is 6 or more. Seems to be pretty much general with the people i've grouped with. Easier than getting an exact count (if you stop to count them all you're dead), and fast to type even on the run. Of course, there's the last one which is simply &quot;zone&quot;... no explenation needed for that I think <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <p>Ulaian Moonleaf <BR>

Course, I usually just lay down and die if I get a &quot;LOTS inc&quot; pull.  Trains can be fun, however, if you have a good chanter, like most of the regulars on this board.  Makes you feel pretty powerful taking down 8 or 9 mobs at a time, y'know? <p><img src=http://www.seven-dreams.org/images/miggy.jpg>

<br>
I will re emphasize it here...<br>
<br>
Whenever you are moving camps ( Single groupm raid, whatever ), You NEVER, EVER, EVER pass your puller.  I cant stress this enough.  It is your PULLERS job to get you to the next camp site safely.  Dont take it upon yourself that it is time to move, ALWAYS check with your puller.<br>
<br>
Request that your puller inform you when it is time to move on the way to camp.  For example, in sebilis, you buff in the entrance and are sitting on the ramp ready to go.  Everyone else starts to run down the ramp after the puller... I sit and say &quot; XXXX(puller's name) can you let us know when its time to move ? Im sitting (yyyyy) (Y= previous camp spot).  <br>
<br>
Most people in your group will find out YOU the enchanter is not with them, and will turn around and come back to wherever you are.<br>
<br>
Another thing that i forgot to say is, Camp is usually where your puller tells you it is.  There are various camp spots usually for any particular &quot; camp&quot; and just because &quot;THIS&quot; puller wants to set up someplace different than what you are used to, doesnt make them wrong.  Each puller should have a pull &quot; pattern&quot; in their head, depending on where they like to stop on the way to camp, and pull once you get to camp.  You want your puller in his comfort zone, and you can mezz whevever he puts you, so camp to you, the enchanter shouldnt matter.<br>
<br>
Another thing, it is helpful if your puller tells you an approximate number of mobs inc ( as the 2 posters above mention ).  It doesnt have to be an exact number, but, somthing along the lines of &quot; here comes a bunch !!&quot; helps a lot, because you then have time to swap out spells if you need to while the pull is INC to camp ( such as AoE mezz if you dont keep this one memmed normally, etc ).<br>
<br>
Last thing, about moving to camps... The instruction for the group to stay where the puller puts them doesnt usually apply to rogues in the 50+ game.  Rogues are your scouters, and might know the dungeon better than even the puller.  I never worry when i dont see my rogue around, because i assume they are either scouting, or hide / sneaking .<br>

I have a piece of paper and a pen,  i'll write the time i cast aq,  then what the time will be in 20minutes.  I find that helps managing mana a lot.  4 aq's is around 40m.  And i generally dont like to dip below 50m.  So i will watch the time,  and i know i have to get to 90m before the haste wears off.<br>
<br>
In Seb,  there are heaps of casters to tot,  its not hard to haste 4 tanks, slow everything, do a lot of cc work and still have extra mana.  Other camps like karnors basement,  its much harder,  and i have to really conserve it.<br>
<br>
Staying between 50m - 90m is important i think,  I want to be able to have enough to cc -anything- the puller brings back.  A few times i have seen some random unexpected stuff happen,  like someone has forgot to snare etc, and we have ended up with close to 10 mobs.  If i wasnt at 80-90 mana, i would have gone oom before we finished even with tot.<br>
<br>
Just my thoughts,  laters ;)<br>

<br>
Another thing you just mentioned is different people have different tastes in camp spots, which is entirely true. There are however a few criteria that one should strive to meet for a camp spot before deciding on it. A camp spot which lives up to all or some of these criteria will make it easier for the group to function as a whole. They are:<br>
<br>
1) Room to fight and maneuver (so rogues can get behind, enchanters space mezzed mobs ect)<br>
2) Line of sight along pulling paths close to camp (makes it possible to mez/root adds before they even reach camp)<br>
3) Centrally placed in the area of pulling (long pulls suck, and if too long can get the puller killed)<br>
4) No ledges, windows, bridges etc. that people can fall off (even if you don't agro a bunch of mobs, it may be hard to get back)<br>
5) Few or no roamers in the area (to reduce the number of unwanted adds)<br>
6) Few or no spawns in the area (same, but more dangerous since there is no warning)<br>
7) Ease of escape (if the shit hits the fan and you need to leave, fast)<br>
<br>
Often small changes in the placement of camp can determine whether it lives up to these or not, and so it can be worthwhile to consider a small move if a nearby site is more optimal. Usally the puller will do this on his own, but the puller will not always be familiar with the dungeon (camping a location and pulling to it are two different worlds, just having been to the camp does not mean you know the area around it. There is always a first time for pulling a camp) and good advice should always be welcome. Of the 7 points stated, #1 to #3 are by far the most important if you want the flow of exp to come fast and steady, #4 to #6 are not really a concern if you have a good group, and #7 is what coffins are for <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  (j/k)<br>

<br>
Just a question really, in a camp like Karnors Basement where there are approximately 0 caster mobs, would it be of help to the enchanter if the puller brought down a low lvl casting mob (like a spectral caller) for him to keep perma-mezzed and ToT to gain extra mana? I do not know enough to myself determine if this would mean the enchanter had more mana due to being able to ToT, or less due to having to re-mezz all the time... help please <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>Ulaian Moonleaf <BR>

<br>
We only have to mezz the mob 1 time every 96 seconds , and i think it cost about 125 mana.  Even if you cant sit to med ( are standing the entire time.. 2 mezzes is 250 mana, and ToT returns about 400 mana every 3 minutes unless the mob partially resists it.<br>
<br>
This rarely occurs ( shrooms partially resist, and other 55+ mobs, but this is rare ).<br>
<br>
C2 Returns 11 mana a tick even if we are not sitting so, at 10 ticks a minute, you are getting 110 mana back standing.  C2 returns the mana back from the mezz, so casting the mez on that one mob is basically free, even if you are standing.<br>
<br>
Most groups wont let you do this, but if you find one that will it is a HUGE help in a camp where caster mobs are infrequent.<br>

I will add, I will allow pulls to start when I'm at 40 if I'm in a place that has plenty o mobs to tap ( Hs or Seblis).  I have also been toying with the idea of using Augment on the puller instead of haste on broken spawns.  I first started thinking about it when I was on slow duty as well as mezz in disco one night.  Robyyn(sp?) of the BMC was pulling and she scolded me for mezzing single pulls.  Instead she would just tank for the ten seconds it took for the last one to die.  I didn't do it on her that night, but I was wondering, is there any real drawback to doing this?  It would improve the pullers ac and give them a pretty good haste that I can cast on my cycle.  I also keep Augment on the cleric in the group.<br>
<br>
   I also have a few rules for mana stressful situations.  If we are getting Lom as a group and stere are still a few mobs to kill in the camp as well as buffs starting to fade. (Never happens?   Ya  .. right) I will, of course, make sure the primary healer has clarity at all costs,  I will also make sure the primary tank has haste at all costs. The healer is obvious but the tank?  If he isn't able to keep taunt, we are screwed.<br>

Direct the tanks to go after the lowest level/easiest mobs first.  This has a couple benefits,<br>
<br>
1. You can usually kill these mobs faster which means less mana mezzing for the enchanter.<br>
2. You usually take less damage which means less mana used for the healing<br>
<br>
In most of the pickup groups I've been a part of the feeling is that you have to go after the hardest mobs first.  This just isn't the case.  Go after the mob that makes the most sense for the situation your in.  <br>
<br>
Another thing you can sometimes do when your getting low on mana.  Just keep the mobs mezzed until the healers have mana.  I can keep 3 mobs mezzed forever assuming no resists and keep them sleeping for a very very long time even with resists.  If the group needs to take a breather midstream just call a halt to the fighting.  A heads up tank will realize whats what and take a pause.<br>
<br>
We once had a near wipeout with a demi in fear.  The pull was two Amy knights and the demi.  By the end, only a couple necro pets, mage pet, and a charmed Amy were left tanking the demi heh.  We managed to kill it, then kept the two Amy's sleeping for 30+ minutes while the whole raid rezzed and buffed themselves.  <br>

Most recently, just the other night with Tran, Agai, and Merro in EW.  Tran accidentally pulled all of the Ry'Gorr Elite guards to us - not to mention the Oracle too - and, after seeing all the MOBs he had, I AOEed them, then single-mezzed as they broke.  With the help of another group, my party killed all the ones that escaped my AOE, then Tran asks 'How long can you hold those?'  My response: 'Forever.'  With three MOBs on my plate at 39 (Yeah, my sig's not up-to-date.  So sue me.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ) I can hold them indefinitely without loosing or gaining mana (unless I fizzle or they resist).  It wasn't till after I was sitting there timing my castings of Enthrall that I realized that all of the MOBs there conned red.  That freaked me out.  I have no idea how I managed that entire crowd with exactly 5 resists in 20+ castings of Enthrall on MOBs three or more levels above me.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :eek --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/eek.gif ALT=":eek"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   /boggle  Anyhow, that was one of my &quot;enchanter moments&quot; as Llorian so eloquently put it.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I've found this to be an increasingly handy tactic.  I've done it several times in both Crystal Caverns and Cazic Thule.

<br>
It may be cause I'm usually in tells with at least ONE person, if not two. Sometimes, this can be really distracting and I lose my internal clock on mez.<br>
<br>
I do have a digital watch within hand's reach at my computer desk, set to stopwatch mode, so I can time mez with a watch if I want to... the only problem with using this is, theoretically,  you'll have to keep watch nearly in hand for 3-4 hours. I have timed stuff on my watch before, only to forget I was timing it <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I suppose this is more to do with YOU and how well you can keep track of an extra mob that will be mezzed for hours. It probably becomes second nature if you do it enough. I find it sort of...suspenseful though. For me, it's fun if occasionally you have to play very smart and alert, but draining if I have to do it for hours on end. I've proven my skills to myself many times before, all of these &quot;enchanter moments&quot; popping up, and it does feel very nice when you've just done something somewhat hard. My personal preference while exping is playing with as little things I have to keep track of at once.<br>
<br>
I would also consider keeping it for emergency use only. Camps like Karnor's hand room, I remember, is very low on caster mobs, and the fights there can be pretty hectic as an enchanter. Hands themselves have relatively high hp and that leaves a lot of time for things to go bad/respawn. It has happened to me on a number (small number, but still) of occasions that we got behind in the spawn, and since we never really split spawn usually, ended up with 3-4 hands up at once. I can see how it could be useful here, assuming you don't ToT it until you get into a situation like this (ie ToT will always be up until you need it)<br>
<br>
However, I lived through those situations without it. You don't have to be able to keep any situation mezzed forever. You just have to keep all the stuff mezzed until your cleric ooms and you have to evac out <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I personally think it's more of a convenience than a necessity. I can't think of a time where it would've meant the difference between victory and wipeout. That doesn't mean it never will though.<br>
<br>
I lived for 51 levels before any mana drain type thing. If you find yourself lower on mana, take steps to change that. Llorian posted some good ideas, like not slowing a single pull mob if cleric is doing well in mana. Alter your play style slightly and you can alter mana levels in group.  <p><br><br>
