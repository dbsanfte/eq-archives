Gosh, I feel so priviledged to have you grace my posting with your response... nah, actually not.<br>
<br>
Cendan, once again you have completely missed the point. You seem to have little idea as to what biblical translation and exegesis is about. I am certain that you couldn't adequately respond to issues of inerrancy. Do you even understand the difference between a version of the bible versus a translation? Doesn't seem like it from your response.<br>
<br>
Basically, you have written off issues that have plagued theologians for centuries with your &quot;I have 100% certainty&quot; BS line. You don't have that certainty because you don't understand what that sort of certainty means. You have *faith* but that is not certainty. Nice try.<br>
<br>
Let me recommend Cendan that you do not continue your rigid ways of thinking. An open heart and mind will allow you to learn from people. Even those you completely disagree with. Seems to me that is the general consensus in this thread surrounding your legalistic approach to the bible and life in general.<br>

Would she die for him?  Does God love Jeffery Dhamer?  <br>
  Life isn't about me or you.  We all bit that apple.  Self-righteous indignation won't get 'me' or 'you' anywhere.  I've been through this 'truth' phase just like you Cendan.  Until I realized the importance of love.  Half of my life was neglected by my attempt at logically rationalizing life's pains.  It's important to learn about life and our relationship with God but God isn't only truth.  Jeffery Dhamer's mother would die for her son in the name of God.  I guarentee it.  Thats some powerful shit.  <br>
  <br>
  You sound like a Jehovah's witness friend I HAD, who claimed that my belief and relationship with God was simply my psychology.  He felt this way because I wasn't in his church.  If Jehovahs witness were the only ones who knew the truth, how could I possibly have a relationship with God.  Neglect Love and talk all the truth you want, it will only create an imbalance in your life.  Stay blind and keep runing face-first into walls that truth won't allow you to see.  Eventually you will want to be loved and love.  <br>
<br>
  After reading your several posts, I have learned something.  Just as Jesus died for us I want to die for my children and or other's children.  To think that might be someone like you puts me at another hurdle in my life.  To forgive those who do not forgive is a difficult thing.  Thanks Cendan, I've been loking for another challenge in my life.  This one will keep me busy for a while to come.  Meanwhile, picturing the look on your face everytime you hit one of those walls you cant' see will help me though this.   <br>

I can't fathom how you want to live in eternity with a God that condems people to hell because they didn't follow his ways- when they were completely oblivious of his ways BECAUSE God and no one else ever told them the correct ways.<br>
<br>
And no, I don't mean &quot;correct&quot; ways like murder etc.  I mean all of your by the letter stuff like baptism etc.<br>
<br>
Now you may again say &quot;oh well God decides what is fair and what isn't&quot;... That is just plain bullshit in this case.<br>
<br>
If that is what you want, so be it I think you are so diluted by the exact words of the bible, but please stop telling everyone that your way is the right way, because it sure as hell isn't. <p>Tuan {Cupcakes} the Vicar</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/utealdare1.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tealdare1</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 73<br> <font color=#E9D756>(2/6/02 2:11:33 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=269.topic&index=158>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Expectations and consequences of God</span><hr size=1> I haven't failed to miss the point.

<br>
Interestingly enough haven't we seen some of that in this thread? Haven't we read comments from those who claim to be devout followers of Christ, but who lack a high regard for people in general and even fellow Christians?<br>
<br>
Another issue I see raised in the above quote is the ability of some Christians to even try to impose a state religion. It is easy for them to beat their drum of &quot;Godly Nationalism/Patriotism&quot; at the cost of all those who don't choose their view. Thankfully it hasn't happened in this country like in some others, but just what would Christian fundamentalists do to the United States (or the country you may live in) if they gained control of the Government?<br>
<br>
Would we see lines of people being hearded into concentration camps for being Jewish, Muslim or Buddhist? Would we see a rash of Christian conversions in order to appease those who recently gained power?<br>
<br>
After 9/11 I caught a glimpse of the above. I had a &quot;devout Christian&quot; question not only my integrity but loyalty to my country solely on the basis that I am an atheist. It was far to easy for this person to disrespect my beliefs because, as he said, &quot;The country is Christian, always has been, and will be.&quot; For this person atheists should go to Communist China, Muslims to Iran, and Buddhists to &quot;wherever they come from&quot;. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Interesting.<br>

Guess I will answer the last few posts again....<br>
<br>
First of all let me tell you that I have no clue where the idea comes from that I am on a high horse.  I don't know how anyone can get that idea.  You know why I am a Christian today?  Because my father was smart enough to listen to my mother when she taught him the gospel.  Because I was lucky enough to be born to parents who saw my eternal future as something worth nurturing.  Because I was lucky enough to meet a girl who inspired me to learn more about God.  Because I was lucky enough to meet another woman while I was at school that inspired me to want to be a better person, and who married me.<br>
<br>
To be more accurate I don't believe in luck, but I don't know to what degree God will interfere in our lives today so I don't always presume good fortune is from Him, or bad for that matter.  I do believe that He made the world and everything in it, so indirectly it is all from Him so I am thankful.<br>
<br>
Anyway, my point is that I have done very little to end up where I am today.  So I certainly don't feel proud of anything.  The gospel is open to all and it isn't like I earned my salvation.<br>
<br>
If I get sarcastic or seem to have a "you are stupid" attitude it is not intentional.  I tend to get angry when discussing this stuff.  Angry that the person for not listening, but 90% angry at myself for not being able to find the right words to be convincing.<br>
<br>
Lots of people say to not worry, but they don't believe in God, they don't believe the message so it doesn't matter to them.  They don't see that not spreading God's Word condemn's people to eternal seperation from God and to hell.<br>
<br>
It is almost funny to me how people think that I enjoy annoying people.  How I like telling them I don't think they are saved.<br>
<br>
As if that isn't bad enough people come along and say things like "invite people into your heart" and "jesus loves"...to completely mislead people to thinking they are saved.  Problem with this teaching is that once people hear this they don't want to hear about baptism because that would mean their friends, their family, their neighbors, ... that most people, are not saved.<br>
<br>
Yes you need to invite Jesus into your heart, in the waters of baptism.  Yes Jesus loves, just as God loved Jesus and let him suffer the cross.  Jesus  will not break His word to save people.  I know that because of how He cried over a lost city in the New Testament.  I know that because He went to the cross.  I know that because He says so, and He has kept His promises.<br>
<br>
Its funny that people get so defensive.  They like to assume things about someone who has nothing but their soul in mind.  Maybe they think we think we get a cookie for every conversion.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Lurikeen,<br>
<br>
What does Fyodor Dostoevsky say about people who assume things about religious people in an attempt to discredit them so they can go on sinning with no fear of Godly retribution?<br>
<br>
Me hate people, thats rich.  According to you I don't respect them, even fellow Christians.  First off I don't disrespect them, only their false teaching.  Secondly they aren't fellow Christians.<br>
<br>
Then there is the state religion.  Thats not only a serious jump but it also isn't what Christians are looking for.  New Testament Christians believe that each congregtion has its own leaders.  There is no unbiblical leadership of all the churches as the Catholics do, with the exception of Crist of course.<br>
<br>
Even beyond that there is the fact that the Bible says "narrow is the way." Meaning only a small percentage of people will make it to heaven, the rest will get the change but will disregard it.<br>
<br>
Then there is this "devout Christian" that you speak of.. that I seariously question the salvation of.  He could be a baptised Christian in which case he is saved but very immature in the faith if he believes what he said.<br>
<br>
True Christians do not want physical, mental, or any other type of persecution enacted on anyone.  In fact, its my suggestion that you be a Christian or that you go and be as good a sinner as you can.  You might as well enjoy the short time you have here on earth.<br>
<br>
Anyway, gonna spend time on my web site so people can read info without me having to repeat myself.  Atleast I got some material from this thread and an idea what questions to answer. <p><table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" height="1">

No, actually I saw the bait and instead of saying something like "I know you didn't name me but there really isn't anyone else in this thread to which it applies" I turned it around and baited you waiting for you to say something as stupid as "I didnt name you."<br>
<br>
How amateur, but I assure you I saw it. You are right, you didnt name me but I read through the posts... so tell me, whom were you talking about? <br>
<br>
I neither have a large ego or any guilt at all, but thanks for playing.  Be more creative next time so I don't see it coming.<br>
<br>
Oh, and yes, I do feel VERY good to be one of the few who gets into heaven.  Its like God wrote us all million-dollar checks and I am one of the few to sign my name on the back.  Real proud of myself, doing the equivalent of signing my name.  Yeah.. That sure earned it, of course I am amazing.<br>
/sarcasm off.<br>
<br>
Its funny because with few exceptions your messages have all been condescending and challenging.  Not challenging mentally but slap you with a glove meet me in the street challenging.  Why are you so judgemental about me responding in kind?  Because its unchristian?  Read your Bible, even Jesus was sarcastic.  Sorry to say my time is not devoted to proving Lurikeen wrong, not to proving God right (cause He just is), but trying to spread the truth.  <br>
<br>
I don't know if I hit a nerve slowly through post after post, or if your true colors just started showing.  Either way, sexual jokes including Jesus are the epitome of disrespect not to mention very uncreative.<br>
<br>
You obviously don't even read whole posts, just skim and fill in the rest with what you think they posted.  Where did I ever even hint that I would glad to see ANYONE in hell?  There is no one that cannot repent.  I would remind you that the Apostle Paul once killed Christians before he was one, but then you would just make sexual jokes about him too, so never mind.<br>
<br>

The Bible has been trasnlated into almost every language in the world and is the best seller every year.  A person can read their Bible, do what is says, and make it to heaven.  No interpretation needed.  The problem comes when falst teachers come in and confuse people.<br>

(The first can apply to other religions.)<br>
<br>
I heard about a car wreck where a whole family crashed.  All the children died (I think 4 or 5 of them).  Later while interviewing the father, he says &quot;I just want to thank God for looking after me.&quot;  It baffled me that he thanks God for saving him after everyone died.  If he thinks God saved him, who is then responsible for the crash?  It just looks like rose colored glasses to me.<br>
<br>
After I had cancer and was able to remove it, people would say to me &quot;God was with you and saved you.&quot;  I would reply (to the people that knew I was atheist) &quot;Yeah, but since he gave me cancer, I call it even.&quot;<br>
<br>
I also wondered why more Christians are not attracted to the Latter Day Saints.  They have the latest scriptures.  The New New Testament after Jesus came to America after the resurrection.  It seems that this testament has just as much proof as the original new testaments, yet people are more skeptical.  Maybe it is just people don't want to investigate other religions when they feel their current religion meets their needs.<br>
<br>
The &quot;God exists out of time&quot; has always bothered me.  If he is outside of time then he should know all that happens and have perfect prophesy (besides where he modifies the world.)  So when he makes the angels, he knows he is making some that will rebel against him.  There is no free will in others if you know what will happen based on what you do.<br>
<br>
I have also had problems accepting &quot;blind faith&quot; arguments.  That is where you just accept something without any higher reasoning or proof.  With &quot;blind faith&quot; you should worship David Kereish or the bum on the street saying he is the second coming.<br>
<br>
My grandmother keeps trying to convert me.  One of my responses is &quot;You say you know Jesus is real.  I have a friend that says she saw Diana (one of the Greek goddesses) and knows she is real.  I have people tell me if I worship the wrong version of Jesus I go to hell.  Most religion say they are right and all others are wrong.  (Luckily not all religions do this.)  So there is no way to choose one religion over the other since they are all based on belief in something that cannot be proven true.&quot;  But that never phases her.  She just says she <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> knows</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Jesus is real and that should be enough.<br>
<br>
Well, enough ramblings.  Religious discussions can be enlightening.  Too often they just fall into insults or immature actions.<br>

Hmmm... ever read the &quot;Tell Tale Heart&quot; by Edgar Allan Poe? You certaintly are one paranoid fellow. Perhaps it is guilt over all the judging you have been doing? Maybe the worry you are incorrect about your interpretation of scripture? You seem rather insecure, Cendan. Yes, I have done a flame or two, but if you go through this thread and count up all the posts that I have written then compare how many are flames (or your &quot;street challenging&quot;) versus thought out presentations of fact, I think you will find you are wrong. However, given that you are weighted with guilt over all the statements of condemnation you have made here I think even the least offensive statement I could make would look like a flaming attack to you. I suppose you should get over yourself and seek the forgiveness of those humans you have harshly judged. Until then that Heart will just keep beating under the planks, giving you away with every word you speak or write.<br>

<br>
Um, no attempt at recovery.  I saw right through your lame attempt.  On the off chance that you didn't intend to bait, then you are incredibly predictable.  Either way I was waiting for the exact response I got.  If I had predicted your response you would have said "I wasn't going to say that." But, whatever, it isn't worth discussing cause you will just lie to make a point.<br>
<br>
<font color=yellow>That statement is a little gem, Cendan. I like the "Oh, you weren't talking about me, so who were you talking about then?" bit. Yup, your EGO is rather large.

I know, you would like to think the post was put there just to bait you, but it wasn't..</font color><br>
<br>
Let me help you here, remember saying this:<br>
<br>
<font color=yellow>Interestingly enough haven't we seen some of that <b>in this thread? </b>Haven't we read comments from those who claim to be devout followers of Christ, but who lack a high regard for people in general and even fellow Christians?</font color><br>
<br>
Notice the bolded "in this thread"?  So, after reading through this thread again I ask who were you talking about?  Despite the fact that you misenterprit and misjudge me there isn't anyone else who would fit your statement.<br>
<br>
Paranoia?  I am not familiar with the clinical definition.  Does a paranoid individual have to care if a half wit is out to get them?  Its purely rhetoric since regardless of the answer, I just don't care what you think.<br>
<br>
Guilt?  Well thats another poor assumption since I have done nothing wrong here.  Not to mention I am a saved christian so guilt isn't even an issue.  Jesus takes care of all that for me, but I appreciate the concern on your part.<br>
<br>
I believe I used english when I stated that only God condemns people.  I don't tell people they are going to hell, I tell them if they don't listen to God they are.  Its plain, its simple, and yet you still can't follow me.<br>
<br>
Apparently you are one of those people who won't accept God because that means there is something out there smarter than you, a category which quite a few species actually fall into.  It also gives you a feeling of no control in your life.  Sorry you feel that way.<br>
<br>
<font color=yellow>Heheheh, truth be told I wasn't thinking of "getting it on" in a sexual sense and never meant it that way. However, many a sexual joke about Jesus can be very funny and creative. Such as, do you know why Jesus calls the gates in Heaven the "Pearly Gates"? I will let you figure out the punchline, Cendan.</font color><br>
<br>
Um.. yeah.. cause I have seen "getting it on" used in so many other ways.  Regardless its pretty hypocritical to call me disrespectful and then tell jokes about Jesus which will no doubt offend me (although He doesnt need my defense) and others.<br>
<br>
<font color=yellow>Cendan, your posts dealing with salvation betray your obvious glee in sending people to hell. Sure, you don't see it that way, but I will wager I am not the only person on this board who sees you take pleasure in pointing out how people are not saved (which means they are going to hell).</font color><br>
<br>
Not only are you a poor judge of character but you also assume that others on the board are as ignorant?  If I was glad people were lost I would shut up and laugh at them under my breath.  As a person you aren't worth sharing the gospel with but as a soul you are.  Regardless of how someone (including but not limited to you) treats me, their soul still matters.<br>
<br>
<font color=yellow>Frankly Cendan you couldn't hold an "intelligent conversation" with anyone here if your eternal soul depended on it! You think that the biblical rote you spew on these boards even resembles intelligent dialogue? Any trained Parrot can quote scripture. It takes intelligence to do careful exegesis and you certaintly have not demonstrated here that you know much of anything about scholarly biblical interpretation. Rather, I asked you pointed questions theologians have grapled with for hundreds of years and you said they were "trite". Shows how much you really know (not much).</font color><br>
<br>
Personally I am not at all worried about keeping up in what you consider an intelligent conversation.  Like I stated, it is not an easy thing to change the Bible and have no one notice.  I assume that you have directly translated scroll fragments yourself and found inconsistencies?<br>
<br>
The trite comment was also refering to your questions which you no doubt view as some kind of huge problem for Christians, when in reality it is a small thing.  So tell me what you know that discredits all the scroll fragments that have been found.  You obviously are an expert on the subject.<br>
<br>
<font color=yellow>Cendan, I wasn't emoting a laugh about what I had written. I emoted a laugh about you. I was laughing at you. Can you grasp that?</font color><br>
<br>
Oh, nice recovery, except that still leaves you in a position to not be laughing at others.  You laughing at others is like a clown in full dress making fun of a woman for wearing white shoes after Labor Day.  That's okay though, cause like I said... enjoy this short life as much as you can.  If laughing at others makes you feel better about yourself then by all means have at it.<br>

<br>
     From what I have read of your posts there seems to be a problem with the path to heavan you decribe. It all seems as if some mathematical formula was pulled out of The Bible. Do X and Y and get to Heavan. kinda dry and boring if ya ask me. Not to metion it leaves out, in my opinion, the most important things in any religion, spiritualism &amp; faith. Without these the formula really does not mean anything. One cannot force oneself to feel these things just to fit a formula. A true sense of faith and a spiritual connection with God is something that is truly necessary. Having just the frmula does not work. I think much of what is in the Bible is less commandment and more guidline to help one to aquire a state of faith and spirituality.<br>

See how hate has made you poweful! *cackles* (I couldn't resist that last statement. ) <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Cendan, just an FYI. Long ago, I studied Koine Greek (translated parts of the New Testamament from Greek to English), hermeneutics, and various courses in apologetics. I am not an expert, but have a solid understanding of Biblical translation, interpretation, and the various issues involved.<br>
<br>
It really doesn't surprise me that a Fundy such as yourself can misidentify critical issues relevant to the dogma you pound. What is a bit surprising is how much at ease you are with down playing any issue raised to you no matter how it is presented.<br>
<br>
Any way, I am going to leave this as my last set of comments to you. I am truly sorry I engaged in small flame fest with you. I want to apologize to you for flaming you.<br>

If you are baptised you don't get a free ticket to heaven.  As stated repeatedly there is a life style to adhere to.  Not to mention I don't think I said baptism gets you to heaven, I said that lack of baptism gets you to hell. <p><table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" height="1">

I was speaking in a broader sense. Look at it this way. If you go through the motions of baking a cake and do it to a precise formula and the formula is a good one you will most likley get a good cake. Someone who is excellent at baking and uses the formula as only a guideline can and most likely will make a better cake. This is where art trancends science just like spirituality and faith trancend commandments. The commandments are a guidline to get you to the where you should be in a spiritual and faithful sense. Things that help you along you journey to build your relationship with God. I doubt very seriouly the ommision of one act will condemn you to hell. I bet Heaven is packed with people who were never baptised. Why? Because they had Faith.<br>
