<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I came away from this movie thinking damn this movie was .....<br>
absolutely terrible. <br>
<br>
<br>
The acting was atrocious. Very few of the characters had on screen presence at all. Exceptions being Christopher Lee and Ewan Mcgregor. The dialogue was awful and forced. For those of you trying to suggest that the dialogue in episodes 4-6 was the same check yourself and watch the films again. Yes there was some bad dialogue but those characters could pull off that diaglogue because the dialogue was actually witty. This dialogue wasn't even suitable for Scary Movie 3.<br>
<br>
First,<br>
<br>
Anakin- Again I don't see any way that this character in Episode 2 mimics anything of what Darth vader becomes. Yes Luke Skywalker was petualant but he wasn't so whiney and he at least listened to Obi Wan and showed respect. Luke was curious about things just like Anakin was in Episode 1. Anakin would have been 1000x better had they made him much more elegant with curiousity yet hinted at dark side tendancies/elements. Essentially he was an Nysc'd version of Anakin Skywalker. Even though he would have been a bit old for the part, Jude Law would have made an incredible Anakin Skywalker in Episode II. He has that aura of refinement along with a dark, brooding, character. Not to mention he can act. The love scenes were like one night stand pick up lines. No chemistry between the Queen and Anakin<br>
<br>
Queen A- Again a total miscast. She's supposed to be ten years older no? Why not get a new actress?. Portman was brutal in Episode I why bring her back? I haven't thought of a replacement because currently there seems to be a dearth of refined strong willed actresses who have that particular on screen charisma. Portman has the charimatic presence of a rock. Her dialogue has little feeling or emotion and the love scenes were forced like the poster said above. It looked like she'd rather pull splinters out of her ass all day than be anywhere near Anakin. <br>
<br>
Mace Windu- I love Samuel Jackson but he's much too stiff to play this role. It just doesn't work well. He's better here than in Episode 1 but he still seems way out of place. Lawrence Fishburne, as someone in my office suggested would have been a better cast. If you don't believe me look at the job he does playing Morpheus in the Matrix. He's already on his way to James Earl Jones status. Stoic character with an incredible speaking voice which demonstrates great power.<br>
<br>
Obi Wan- Ewan McGregor was solid, much better than in Episode one. Looks like he's rounding into shape. He was one of the few highlights in an absolutely dreary movie.<br>
<br>
Count Dooku- Christopher Lee was the star. By far an away the best actor in the entire movie. He was credible as a power Jedi Master and he had the grace and refinement to play the part. He has a very powerful on screen charisma. Too bad his part was relatively short.<br>
<br>
Jar Jar Binks- He sucks kill the bastard now! Why Lucas insists on returning this character is beyond me. Shouldn't have been in episode one much less returning to episode two.<br>
<br>
Boba Fett- Did anyone else want to punch this kid in the mouth for his pedantic and inane behaviour. Hey I know he's a kid but he acted like a two year old instead of the 10 year old he's supposed to be. Boba Fett is a stoic character in epidsodes 4-6. He's ins't some dumb kid who acts like some prepubscent teen that's worried about getting his candy.<br>
<br>
Emperor Palapatine- Ian Mcdarmid (sp?) is excellent in the film but he must be scratching his head wondering why he signed on for this tripe. He gets his role because he was there for episodes for 4-6. He understands the context of the role.<br>
<br>
Jengo Fett- I was faily neutral on this character. Felt he was decent but didn't really impact the movie other than to explain a sub plot of Episodes four through six. Could have used a bit more background IMO.<br>
<br>
Everyone keeps saying that this is fantasy film and I agree but that doesn't give poetic license to make characters that don't make sense. Part of the allure of the original episodes was the development and continuity of the original characters. They matured but you could see a linear progression. Heck Anakin in Episode 1 was more mature and refined than Anakin in Episode two. Sure , in episode 2 Anakin is a teen but he's shown as a dolt and a whiner. He's a risk as a jedi candidate in Episode 1 because he's conflicted and fearful not because he's a whiney and ignorant malcontent.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I have to admit the special effects were incredible but they seemed wasted on this abominable film. <br>
<br>
<br>
Overall It's a D on an A-F grade scale. Only the special effects and agood acting by a few save this movie from an F rating. I was so close to actually walking out on this movie and I haven't walked out on a movie since Pret A Porter in 1994 and I've seen some horrible films since then.<br>
<br>
Now if you want a movie with excellent plot development as well as character development and action and very good love scenes see Spiderman if you already haven't. Spiderman has very few flaws and the flaws in and of themselves are acceptable because they really don't interfere with the story.<br>
<br>
No I'm not some 40 year that can't get over the original series. I disliked the Ewoks in Return of the Jedi. I didn't make me hate the movie because the rest of the movie had excellent dramtic scenes just like episodes 4 and 5. It's that I don't sense any drama. This is a John Woo like movie with excellent coregraphed fight scenes but lacking in plot and drama to build up to the scenes. I'm 27 so maybe I don't get these movies but what made the first movies so great was the excellent balance of fight scenes drama and a climatic story like a cliffhanger.  The dialogue while not amazing in episodes 4-6 was made simply the beliablity of the repartee between the characters involved. The problem with Episode 1 an2 is that the dialogue isn't as good and this problem is magnified by the lack of credibility of repartee between Anakin, Padame (Queen), Obi Wan etc ...<br>
<br>
The movie moves at an uneven pace.which really killed me. The story was fine bu the execution was poor is simply whatit comes down to. Miscast actors and non-linear character and plot development killed this movie for me. <br>
<br>
No, I didn't watch this movie to critique it. I went as a Star Wars fan looking to watch the movie, this is stuff that came to mind while I was watching it. I didn't bring a pad and paper to write every inconsistency and issue I had. I just walked of the theatre disgruntled and wondering what happened to the execution of a movie which had a good plot yet failed mightly to provide the richness of character that episodes 4-6 gave me. In those episodes I could easily and willfuly identify with the characters. Can I identify with Anakin? Not at all. Sure I've been bitter and sure I suffered from the avarice of youth, but I wsan't supposed to be a jedi and I certainly had much greater conviction and a sense of morality at the age or what 18, 19 than Anakin did. Maybe I'm abnormal for this. Sure I act immature, but like everyone else says it's fantasy so he can be held to different standards an he should represent a sterotypical teen in today's society. Fantasy doesn't have to be realistic but why not at least keep it consistent.<br>
