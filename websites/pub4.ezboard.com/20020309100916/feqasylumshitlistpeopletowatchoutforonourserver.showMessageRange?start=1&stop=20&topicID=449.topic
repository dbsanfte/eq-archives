Forcing someone to share a camp isn't SL material, and shouldn't be here.  However, deliberately taking MOBs that were already engaged is a violation of game rules.

When you are low level, you dont have as much time invested ( and you can get your gear to your new character so you dont lose that), so there is little to lose.<br><br>2) Players that are REALLY new dont really know what is going on yet, and should be given an opportunity to learn.<br><br>3) EQ is sorta like a pyramid, with hundreds and hundreds of lower level characters, and a smaller amount of higher level characters.  At the higher levels, the chances are very good that you will come in contact with an individual, due to the reduced areas to hunt for exp, and the much smaller number of higher level characters than lower level ones.<br><br><br>This list is a powerful thing, and should be treated as such.  Sometimes, an individuals actions are SO bad, they deserve to be on the list even at a low level (see binidin). Those times are fairly rare however.  Someone ninja looting the orc pawn you killed isnt the same as someone ninja looting a dragon for instance.  Same crime, larger magnitude due to the creature. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/beqasylum.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=leafbringernathanial>Leafbringer Nathanial</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>n00b!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(3/23/01 3:21:01 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=449.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Sixteen, the KSer</span><hr size=1> definitely shitlist low levels!<br><br>they're more important than high levels!<br><br>if you SL the lowbies, perhaps it'll knock them in the head enough to change their ways!<br><br>the high level shitlisted are people with set-in ways and it's hard teaching old dawgs new tricks, eh?<br><br>however, most low level players who suck become high level players who suck, so i personally see no trouble with calling them as early as possible.  it's the best thing really.<br><br>hey btw we have a great guild on lanys  -<br><br>NINE REALMS!<br><br>go to www.9realms.com and checkitout.<br><br>Leafbringer Nathanial<br>Ranger of 41 Seasons<br>Officer of 9 Realms <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/umagikemperor.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Magik Emperor</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>n00b!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(3/23/01 4:59:02 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=449.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Sixteen, the KSer</span><hr size=1> A couple things Six, first of all, I think it's really low to tell MY story about you, against me.  I have never ksed anyone in my entire time playing everquest, I treat everyone like I would like to be treated, in fact I buffed you before you came &amp; ksed us. Second, you told my guild leader that you had a level 60 character when he tried to reason with you &amp; make you share the camp, but you just ignored him.  Third of all, that was really high level equipment you had (hence a lvl 2 monk soloing a mummy that was yellow to a lvl 8.)  , if you didn't have a really high character, where did you get that equipment?  &amp; I do have the log if you still insist that we ksed you.  That is all I have to say until your next false accusation.<br>    <br>   ps: Sixteen claims to be level 22 now, I think that is a high enough level to be shit-listable<br><br>       Rahnfar the cleric <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/umagikemperor.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Magik Emperor</A> at: 3/23/01 5:16:53 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/beqasylum.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=six>Six</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>n00b!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(3/23/01 5:37:30 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=449.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Sixteen, the KSer</span><hr size=1> Gosh.... all the stuff that was on me was from a friend.

I mean, you had no grounds for taking our camp, if you had just asked us nicely to share the spawn instead of just taking them then I would have been fine with that, but no, you had to be an ass &amp; just steal it, if you keep this kind of stuff up you ARE gonna be banned soon enough!  I would be a happy man if I never had to see you ever again, but I'm sure you'll ks one of my higher level characters.
