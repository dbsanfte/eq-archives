You say you bought a fungi tunic and gave it to Ardinel to trade with you and he went LD and never returned.  If someone brought these accusations to me, I would probably ask the following:<br><br>What is your monk's name?  You only sign as Yoogi the beastlord.  <br><br>What character were you on when you made the purchase?  Name, class and level?<br><br>From whom did you purchase it?<br><br>Where did you meet Ardinel?  Where did you fight together?  What time did you normally play at that point?  If he is now only playing at 3:00 AM your time, how did you get together and become good friends?<br><br>Do you have any logs or screenshots to support any of your accusations?  Any conversations with Ardinel?  Any conversations with Mooshi?<br><br>As you said, you brought it to the leadership of the Loyal Circle, an appropriate action.  An officer posted that the matter was investigated and found to be without merit.  Were you unable to answer any of the above questions? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uyoogi.showPublicProfile?language=EN>yoogi</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>n00b!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(1/21/02 8:46:46 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> ardinal/mooshi</span><hr size=1> monks name is cailen <br>my druid was lev 30 when he bought it <br>don't rember it was some elf warrior with epic<br>well ardinal and i meet in perma frost he was giving away newbie leather armor i was currently a newbie at the time but he not have any in my size so he said contact him later and thats how we got to be such good friends he used to play at normal times like noon tilll midnight everday but only wanted ppl to contact him on the weeekends <br>no i did not he was my best friend thought no reason to distrust him<br>nope and was not harassing loyal circle was my only link to ardinal and i was just trying to find him if u lost a fungi tunic u would do everthing u could to get it back right<br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/urivlas.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Rivlas</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Cyber Pimp</span><br> <font color=#000033>(1/21/02 10:56:51 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ardinal</span><hr size=1> Please learn some proper sentence structure and spelling please.

I have never heard a complaint about him.  Then out of the blue, you accuse him of things.  Who should I believe?  The person I know and trust or someone I do not know?<br><br>Partly the reason people give you hell about your grammar is because a well written and well delineated argument with correct grammar and punctuation points out that you are a person who is to be taken seriously.  If someone came up to you on the street and you had a hard time understanding that person, Not because they spoke a foreign language, but because they had never taken the time to learn their own language properly, you wouldn't be inclined to take that person very seriously.<br><br>This charge you have brought against him is a serious charge.

O and lets not forget the punctuation.<br>longfeellow<br>ranger of the 51st season<br><br>&quot;u got a problem with me, call someone who cares&quot; <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uyukoonjaak.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Yukoonjaak</A> at: 1/22/02 1:44:44 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/utarotoflanys.showPublicProfile?language=EN>TarotofLanys</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.srforum.f2s.com/phpBB/images/smiles/icon_pirate.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle><FONT COLOR=AA0000><B>Moderator Pirate</B></FONT></span><br> <font color=#000033>(1/22/02 1:03:43 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.camelotherald.com/realms/insignia/n_emblem_021.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ardinal/ mooshi</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> hey jack asses,<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br><br>WOW there's a good start <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br><!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> 1). did u ever think that the kid is foreign???<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br><br>Actually I didn't post previously...but yes, that initally crossed my mind...until I saw this word: &quot;w8ed&quot;. Foreigners don't use that. Why? Because you'd have to have an amazing grasp of the english language to understand to substitute 8 for that sound in the word. They'd just spell 'waited'.<br><br>No, this is someone using dood speak. And getting smacked down for it.<br><br><!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> 2). no it dont fockin matter how he spells a fockin word. that just shows how SUPERIOR u are trying to feel. and as for PUNCTUATION, heres your fockin punctuation right up your ass<br>/rude<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br><br>Actually, it does. People coming to the shitlist are looking for two things. First, they're looking to warn people in the community about a problem person. Second they're looking generally for a resolution to a problem and/or justice/revenge. <br><br>So how you present your situation speaks quite a bit to credibility. Someone posting &quot;soandso iz a lozer cuz thay tuk my shite&quot; has less credibility than &quot;Bob, 45 paladin of doozofnorrath in this zone did X, Y and Z&quot;<br><br>Plus let's face it, it's also a hell of alot easier to read. Struggling through the monstrosities that some people post becomes so difficult people don't even bother. Thus negating the entire point of posting in the first place.<br><br><!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> 3). let me ask u this, have u ever done a trade and take screenshots of it????? no i didnt think so, why cuz u TRUST the person that is helping u out.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br><br>Actually, yeah I have before when I was playing. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  However in this type of situation, no I don't think it's reasonable to expect that someone would take screenshots of a trusted close friend exchanging items. However again, with no proof you have to rely on credibility. Can this person produce a screenshot? It would be wonderful if they could, obviously they can't. So how about logs of the aftermath? I'd assume that after he was ripped off, he'd have logged asking the person &quot;Hey, where the hell is my tunic?&quot; <br><br>What about other people who were aware he had the item? Etc.<br><br><br><!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> so no he cannot prove it, and no im not saying it did/didnt happen. but i SWEAR to god u dont have to be dicks about it. YOU people are the kind of people that make me want to quit this game. &quot;correct grammer&quot; &quot;correct punctuation&quot;, well ill say this, ALL and i MEAN ALL of u dont use correct punctuation and GRAMMER when in game. it takes to long. so as far as his spelling and grammer having to do with proof of the shit list, then u all have no clue what so ever of what u are talking about. NO WHERE does it say on the rules that punctuation and grammer are a PRESSED issue for making a shit list.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br><br>Again, how someone speaks in game...and frankly I pretty much typed like this in game as well. I've never been a dood speak fan....and how they post on the board are two different things. <br><br>It's not that difficult to use paragraphs and a spell checker when you're presenting a post for other people. <br><br>His entire point in posting it here is that he wants other people to read it...SO MAKING IT ACTUALLY READABLE is an issue. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br><!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> *advice for you people who are bangin this kid for shitty spelling and grammer.

You yourself gave points on what is reasonable to be expected. So what about his post makes him unbelievable? Hmm?

This is about posts that are damn near unreadable. When people come and present them in a forum where they're asking other people to read the posts to be aware of a situation. <br><br>Making those posts at least marginally literate isn't too much to ask for. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br> <p><a href="http://www.anarchyboard.com" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.conquest-guild.com/tarot/Tarotsign.jpg" border="0"></a> <br><FONT COLOR=000000 SIZE=1>Realm </FONT><FONT COLOR=FF0000 SIZE=1>RETIRED</FONT><BR><FONT COLOR=000000 SIZE=1>Everquest: Fennin Ro, Karana, Ero Marr & Lanys T'Vyl </FONT><FONT COLOR=FF0000 SIZE=1>RETIRED</FONT><BR><FONT COLOR=000000 SIZE=1>Ultima Online: Catskills </FONT><FONT COLOR=FF0000 SIZE=1>INACTIVE</FONT><BR><FONT COLOR=000000 SIZE=1>Anarchy Online: Beta Tester, Rubi-Ka 1 </FONT><FONT COLOR=FF0000 SIZE=1>RETIRED</FONT><BR><FONT COLOR=000000 SIZE=1>Dark Age of Camelot: Beta Tester;Merlin Midgard</FONT><FONT COLOR=008000 SIZE=1> CURRENT</FONT></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ueuphemism.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Euphemism</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://personal.jax.bellsouth.net/jax/f/j/fjferry/img/ezb-euphemism-10x.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I live here.... get out.</span><br> <font color=#000033>(1/22/02 1:41:42 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://personal.jax.bellsouth.net/jax/f/j/fjferry/img/ezb-euphemism-ico.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ardinal/ mooshi</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Not pointing any fingers in this case, but to have proof in cases where &quot;friends&quot; end up scamming you out of borrowed items....trust noone and log everything?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br><br>Yes.
