I came here and read this to learn for myself not only both sides of the story, but also how people behave over a video game.<br>
<br>
I have read all I need to as many who have now seen this thread can decide for themselves what they feel is credible or not and how they feel about the individuals who came here and how they acted over a video game.<br>
<br>
Thanks for giving me the chance to get to know you, have a nice flame.<br>

Don't be stupid. It's about the ablilites of the healers and the equipment the warrior is wearing, not the person doing the main tank job.<br>
<br>
When Breus is referring to Sarkam as a &quot;n00b&quot; he's talking about attitude. I've always found Breus to be infinitely more mature than I've seen Sarkam to be, and I thank God that I get to be around Breus rather than Sarkam. At least Breus never ran around as a little shadowknight or a n00b warrior asking me for gear. Or won something in a random then went to OS to crow about it to the zone. Or any of the other shit that Sarkam has done that's made me go &quot;oh boy..&quot; and count my blessings.<br>
<br>
I've never really liked Sarkam since Aamrie introducted him to me, something that I've kept to myself out of respect for her, as she was a friend in another online roleplaying game long before EQ. It's too bad that it seems most of Sarkam's more annoying traits are rubbing off on her, because she used to be one of the sweetest and most pleasant people to be around.<br>
<br>
Back to the original point I had, you could put Breus or any other high level warrior or even ME playing a warrior wearing the same things Sarkam is wearing and we would've done the same job tanking Vulak. Main Tank ain't shit without the equip and support classes to keep him alive. Nice lame attempt though, Chuk. <p><FONT COLOR=purple>~<b><i>Khael Incantare</i></b></FONT><br><FONT COLOR=silver><i>Proud Officer of Affliction</i></FONT></b></FONT><br><FONT COLOR=silver><i>Sorcerer of Erollisi Marr</i></FONT></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ukhaelwizzie.showPublicProfile?language=EN>khaelwizzie</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://keith.vaughan.home.mindspring.com/img/ball3.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 702<br> <font color=#E9D756>(9/30/01 1:54:38 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: What were you thinking Affliction?</span><hr size=1> I'd break that down into a less flamey post too, but it's not worth it.

I have on our board an application (that im not posting, gag order remember /sarcasm) but it lists some not so nice things about Brues concerning gear and his attitude towards other warriors.

I do want to say, in defense of Sarkam, that unless he ebay'd before the level of 14 (And Why the F__K would somebody do that?)  he's completely legit.  He just brought up an incident to me that I was involved in back in Highpass when he was level 19 or so that nobody else has any business remembering. <br>

<br>
This I address to you. I just sat here reading through this utter waste of time. And I have a few things I would like to address to you three.<br>
<br>
Breus..hun<br>
How in the hell can you address maturity? You arent even out of puberty...<br>
<br>
Khael..hun<br>
You cant say shyte about Sarkam begging for crap for a SK...I <read it now> I played the SK. You and Tsun as well as a few others from Pandemonium gave me stuff. So how come Sarkam is being blamed for whining. HE HAS NEVER PLAYED A SK!!!<br>
His warrior is the only thing that he has played until recently..and now occasionally he plays a cleric..but that is OCCASIONAL...and guess what...we didnt get the equipment from you. As for the crowing about equipment, if I won something cool..I am gonna crow too..hell you did to me a bunch of times.. should I have come here and flamed you for it? No you was my friend....but you sure have a funny way of treating friends. I get home from work and you are dissecting my RL boyfriend; over a stupid fucking game.<br>
<br>
Oakendale hun...hadnt forgotten you..<br>
You and Sarkam both acted like arrogant pricks at times. I disliked Sarkam with a passion when I joined BoO...and I disliked you as well.. But I look for the good in a person and that is why I check on you when I see you on. And that is why me and Sarkam are together in RL. I look past the way people play. <br>
<br>
As for me being the sweetest person; I still am. I will go out of my way to help a person if I can. I give away all my extra equipment. I very rarely sell anything unless I really need the pp. I do that out of respect for you Khael and the others who have given me stuff...but respect is hard to earn and easy to take away.<br>
<br>
I really dont see how this flame became "Let's bytch about Sarkam". This flame is about Affliction KS'ing a Plane. Old news.. Affliction KS'd CE when I was a member there..big deal..old news.. Everyone has KS'd at one point or another. Its how you handle it and yourself that makes a lasting impression. Not if you are a whining ass tit baby.<br>
<br>
/walks off in disgust of the people she thought was friends.<br>
<br>
<br>
Have a nice day and now get the fuck away from me. <p>~In the end, it is all a game..and Verant owns our soul~<BR>  
Aamrie<BR>
That's "Ms Translocate" to you!!

Sarkam's name would never have been brought up if he didnt have to to open his big mouth in something that in absolutely no way concerned him. Plus the fact he added nothing to the topic except make himself look like an ass<br>

His statement had no point in this debate except to bring himself into the spotlight of a flame.  Perhaps thats what he wanted - I really dont care. Your right about one thing though this debate is pretty much dead so we ALL should get on with it...<br>
