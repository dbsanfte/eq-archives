<br>
First of all, I wholeheartedly believe that there are two types of female orgasms.  First girl that I could honestly say I was in love with was older (I was 21 she was 27, now that I'm 31 I can truely see how huge of a maturity gap that was).  She actually showed me where to find the G-spot and how to stimulate it.  I'm talking taking my fingers as though they were paintbrushes and saying &quot;see Danielson, wax on wax off&quot;.  I was amazed at the time as I had no idea women were so......weird!  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
She taught me a lot /sigh<br>
<br>
  Through the years I've had ample oppurtunities to try out the techniques with varying degrees of success.  I do think some (perhaps even most?) women aren't physically or maybe even mentally capable of having a vaginal orgasm.  Though then again, it may just be a matter of finding exactly where the &quot;G-spot&quot; is, because not everyone's body is exactly the same.  Trial and error can be fun though &lt;grin&gt;<br>
<br>
  The last girl I dated (26, actually younger than me hehe), had never experienced an internal orgasm before.  When I was able to give her one she was quite taken aback.  She said it was a different feeling entirely.  Not neccesarily better or worse, but remarkably different.  And she wasn't aware that that's what I was trying to do.  I didn't say &quot;hey I'm gonna try and give you a different orgasm&quot;.  After she had it she said &quot;Oh my god!  Where did you learn how to do that?&quot;.<br>
<br>
  Now the thing to keep in mind though is that I was never able to give her a vaginal orgasm like that through normal penetration.  Orgasm yes (and yes only most of the time, we were very communicative), but not the vaginal orgasm of which we speak.  The reason being that with normal penetration, you don't put as much pressure on the &quot;G-spot&quot; and the friction is spread out among a much wider area.  Kinda like instead of taking a pencil eraser to erase a letter from a page, you take the flat edge of a big ol pink eraser and try to do it.  You just can't target the right spot.  Though there are certain positions that can acheive this, you'll just have to experiment <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
  So, for the ladies out there.  Don't be afraid to to tell your partner how to do it or where to find it.  Chances are they'll be more than happy to make you...well happy <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I know anything that I can do to make a women climb the walls is about the biggest turn on I can think of.<br>
<br>
  And for the guys out there, fingers and tongues are your friends!  As well as the tools you need to make her beg for more <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :evil --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/devil.gif ALT=":evil"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I will say my sex life has rarely been lacking, just the rest of the relationship <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
  Oh, and as far as that Myth thread Brandon.  Think about it, it's from 1970!  That's almost 32 years old <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   My god, I hope SOMEONE has given that woman an internal orgasm by now!  While I do loosely agree that &quot;insert male organ here does not = mutual enjoyment.&quot;, I think this feminist &lt;grin&gt; was sadly misinformed when she put this together (though through no fault of her own I'd say).  Some of the sources she got her information from date back to 1948.  Didn't they still think a human being could survive a nuclear blast at this time?  I think both men and women have learned a lot about opening up in regards to sex since this trash was first created.<br>
<br>
  Oh and by the way, look at the following excerpts...<br>
  _________________________________________________<br>
Considering that the vagina is very desirable from a man's point of view, purely on physical grounds, one begins to see the dilemma for men. And it forces us as well to discard many &quot;physical&quot; arguments explaining why women go to bed with men. What is left, it seems to me, are primarily <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> psychological reasons why women select men at the exclusion of women as sexual partners.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
  _________________________________________________<br>
<br>
and...<br>
  _________________________________________________<br>
<br>
The establishment of clitoral orgasm as fact would threaten the heterosexual institution. <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> For it would indicate that sexual pleasure was obtainable from either men or women, thus making heterosexuality not an absolute, but an option.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> It would thus open up the whole question of human sexual relationships beyond the confines of the present male-female role system.<br>
  _________________________________________________<br>
<br>
  *Sigh* sorry but this doesn't help your argument that homosexuality is something your born with as opposed to a choice.  Personally I think both arguments can be valid on a case by case basis.  Some people are more open to change than others, hard to believe it can be to that extreme but it's true.  I believe it was best portrayed in Chasing Amy.  Amy being lesbian, basically realized she had no way of determining if her true soulmate would be male or female.  That when that person came into her life it would just &quot;feel right&quot;, and it did....with a male.  Sure it's just a movie, but it's just something I figured would help people see my point.  Also, do you see how the article you cited is a little outdated?  Just helpful criticism <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

 &quot;It has also been known that women need no anesthesia inside the vagina during surgery, thus pointing to the fact that the vagina is in fact not a highly sensitive area.&quot;<br>
<br>
This, in my experience, is VERY untrue. I had to have a pinky sized chunk removed from stated area (biopsy of a possibly cancerous lump...negative thank god!!!)...and lemme tell you, I'm pretty sure thats one of the worst pains I've ever felt (over chipping my tailbone and ripping ligaments in my left ankle). I think this MD had read the same article...next time I'm gonna demand some local anesthesia!!!<br>

<br>
Actually the fact that Amy was able to have sex with both men and women makes her bisexual, rather than homosexual (as the term lesbian infers).  I know men think of lesbians as all being bisexual.  In fact there are many theories about this including one stating that every human is bisexual.  The point that you just made clear although just may not have explained it very well is that there are multiple sexualities and different degrees of bisexuality.  Basically, homosexuality = you are attracted to same sex partners only, heterosexuality = you are attracted to opposite sex partners only, bisexuality = you are attracted to both sexes (and this one has different degrees).  While I feel that bisexuals probably make up the majority, they tend to be classified as heterosexuals since they CAN have attraction towards opposite sex and avoid the hatred towards gays.  Some bisexuals who feel VERY strongly about same-sex partners will probably lean towards being with homosexuals as they feel stronger about that.<br>
<br>
So, in summary I believe we are all born either homosexual, heterosexual or bisexual.  Those who are bi then choose which partners they will be with.  However, the same way there are heterosexuals who could not physically have sex with the same-sex, the same goes for some homosexuals.  Of course some people are conditioned to not act the way the feel attraction, but these people tend to stand out.  It is well known that many gay bash because they cannot accept their own sexuality.<br>

Thank you for pointing that out, not to say there are not plenty of other examples out there, but this one most people seem to know about.  Yes, homosexuals chose to be that way for the same reason daredevils do their thing, to risk everything they have including their life for that RUSH, oh the rush of being homosexual! /sarcasm off<br>

As far as achieving orgasm goes in general, what ever has achieving one got to do with finding the right man? I've never really believed people who say they don't wank, but if it's true then, really you should. It's good for you.<br>
