I never said Ghon said &quot;Fuck off&quot; or anything like that.  In fact, Ghon never ONCE responded to my tells asking him to back off.  He just quietly sat there and waited.  It wasn't until AFTER he stole the kill that he finally decided to talk with me.<br>
<br>
I WILL apologize for my attack on you and your guild.  That was uncalled for.  I do not wish to attack your guild in general.  Both you and Errtai have been polite, although I don't feel you are being objective enough here.<br>
<br>
I beleive that allowing this person to remain in your guild DOES reflect on all of you.  You asked what I want you to do?  I want you to do what you feel is right for your guild.  Whether that means booting out a kill stealing liar, or coddling him.  The choice is yours.<br>
<br>
But lets review the ownership of spawn rules.  Bottom line, who ever hits it first, owns the spawn (think AC in South Ro), regardless of who spawned it.  I know, I know, this is a static spawn, so it's more like the AC in OOT.  You have proof that I killed the Tainted and attacked the Corrupted first.  You have proof that I didn't get the kill for the Corrupted.<br>
<br>
I have explained in GOREY detail again and again exactly what happened that day.  I'll explain it 1000 more times if it would make any difference.  I have bee KS'd in the past.  MOST of them are simple misunderstandings.  Even when I was pretty sure it was deliberate, I have kept my mouth shut because I gave them the benefit of the doubt.  However, there is NO question that Ghon DELIBERATELY stole the corrupted that I spawned and he knows this for a fact.<br>
<br>
I will agree with you on one thing.  Ghon DOES believe he spawned the tainted.  But 2 people were camping it and I killed it.  Hence the mob was mine.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, I have been informed that Ghon is on vacation for a couple weeks, so I don't expect to hear from him again for awhile.  8/<br>
<br>
Thanks<br>

<br>
Here's my two copper, for what it's worth...<br>
<br>
Simc IMO since she and Err have been running ROTA have really made a conscious effort to weed out assholes in their guild. I wouldn't have thunk it, but ROTA made a comeback from being pretty slimey to the guild it is today. (Sorry if that offends anyone, but it's true IMO) <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
That being said, I don't think Simc is gonna just blindly defend her guildmates, even if they <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> are</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> her guildmates.<br>
<br>
That also being said, you can't expect a guildleader to kick out someone just based on an incident with one person when there's nothing really hard to back it up. I think she's doing a damn good job trying to look into this.<br>
<br>
That also being said, yeah I believe that guy KSed.<br>
<br>
C'mon he's what level? Jesus Christ. But that's just my <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> opinion</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->. Of course, I also think OJ killed his ex-wife...but anyhoo...<br>
<br>
I like the person who suggested multiquesting. How about that as a resolution? I don't know if this <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> can</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> be multi-ed but seeing as how Ghon realizes now that he was in the wrong, though he claims it was all just a gross misunderstanding, how about he multi's the item to make amends? <br>
<br>
If he doesn't want to multi it, with the realization that he was wrong now in hindsight...that would say alot to character. If he's willing to multi it, again to make amends for a misunderstanding, again that would be rather telling.<br>
<br>
/hopes for the happy ending dammit. <p><img src=http://forsakencoven.homestead.com/files/Tarotsign.jpg>

<br>
and i will talk to ghon about that when he returns.  and once again if he refused i will have to take a long hard look at why he is refusing and his membership in ROA.<br>
<br>
however i do also want to point out that Shur never came to me with this solution rather all he could say to me was what a big peice of shit ghon was and how we should allow him in the guild..leaving me with the feeling the only thing he wanted from me was to kick this *peice of shit* out of my guild.<br>
<br>
if this is what Shur would like me to do then i will be more then happy to StRONGLY suggest to ghon that the peice be multi to it's rightful owner regardless if he thought he was in the right or wrong.<br>
<br>
<br>
ps ..thank you tarot for the kind words...we really do try (me and errtai) but some people think we are the scum of the earth no matter what we do and it gets very defeating at times...this statement was NOT directed at anyone involved with this post... <p><img src="http://user.netomia.com/Brewhaus/simc.jpg">

Thanks for conceeding that he was wrong.  I do understand that it may be difficult to determine who attack the Corrupted first.  That is not what I'm asking you to notice.  Notice that I did get the kill for the Tainted, and the Corrupted attacked me immedately after.  This fact alone makes the Corrupted mine.<br>
<br>
What irks me to no end is the fact that Ghon stalked me while I killed the tainted.  He had plenty of time to THINK about what he was going to do.<br>
<br>
I will NOT argue the fact that he believes he spawned the tainted.  I honestly think he REALLY thought he did.  We were BOTH kiling fish.  Only I was killing the correct fish.  Lets pretend for a moment that NO ONE knew who spawned the fish okay?  Lets also pretend that the Tainted is a random spawn that can spawn from any fish.<br>
<br>
Person A see's the tainted, no one else is attacking, and pulls it.  Person B notices the tainted is up and proceeds to find it.  Person B see's Person A killing the tainted.  Person A kills the Tainted, hence spawning the Corrupted in its place (This SINGLE point gives Person A the right to kill the Corrupted).  Person B preceedes to kill the Corrupted.<br>
<br>
We all know that Person B is wrong.  You have admitted that.  That is as simple as I know how to describe what went on.<br>
<br>
The fact that Ghon patiently waited for me to kill the Tainted only shows that he KNEW what he was doing.  The fact that I engaged the Tainted first (and had it half dead before he even found it) makes the Tainted/Corrupted mob mine.  If I am mistaken somehow, someone please explain why.  My only mistake is that I didn't really believe somone would be THAT low and pull such an obvious kill steal.  OTHERWISE, I would have taken more screenshots and had logging on from the start.<br>
<br>
Simc, again, thank you for reviewing my screenshots.  I am sorry I even remotely attacked you, Errtai, or your guild.  I have NO problem with you.  As far as I'm concerned you have done what you promised, although your decision is wrong, you have heard my case.  I believe you are making a very big mistake by allowing a person such as this remain in your guild.  I'm sure he's very nice to you and your members.  Why not?  He is hiding behind all of you right now.  You can still help him, so he will not burn those bridges just yet.  Mark my words, eventually he will come here again.  This is at least the 3rd shit list worthy post I have seen on him.  His true nature WILL be revealed to you eventually.<br>
<br>
For now, I will stop trying to convince you of his true nature.  To the rest of Lanys; my account here is 100% accurate.  I have nothing to hide and no reason to lie about any of this.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, I'm SURE Ghon will keep a low profile for awhile and most will have forgotten all about this.  I have yet to see Ghon defend himself on ANY SL post about him.  I know he can't defend himself right now, but as soon as he is back from &quot;vacation&quot; I'd love to hear what he has to say for himself.<br>

The way it works with corrupted/tainted is the corrupted pops directly from the corpse of the tainted the moment it dies.  It sounds like Ghon sat there and watched Shurakair kill the tainted, only jumping in as the corrupted spawned and killing it (which would be simple since at full mana he could just nuke where as Shur was probably somewhat drained from the first fight and could probably only root/dot).  This is basically comparable to sitting by while someone turns in the items to spawn something and then running in and killing/looting the mob that pops.  Doesn't matter if he &quot;engaged&quot; the corrupted first, cause he didn't camp/kill the tainted needed to cause it to spawn. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ushurakair.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Shurakair</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>w4nn4b3!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(7/31/01 5:23:30 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ghon </span><hr size=1> A very good analogy Brambler.<br>
<br>
Honestly, I probably could have out nuked Ghon if I was prepared for a KS fight.  I THOUGHT he was just hanging around HOPING I would die in which case he would have an easy fight.<br>
<br>
The reason it took so long for me to kill the Tainted is because I was Root/Doting using a free DoT (similar to ES Vambracers), and DESPERATELY trying to find a guild member of his or a GM.  I was almost full mana when the Corrupted popped, but I chose to run up and tag the mob cause it's faster than nuking.  I wanted NO confusion as to who the mob belonged to.  /shrug  In this case it didn't make any difference.  By the time I realized he was nuking for all he was worth he already had done too much damage.  8(<br>

<br>
I believe you S (too lazy to remember again how to spell your name <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ) when you say it's not about the loot for you.<br>
<br>
IMO (like it matters) you came here because of the whole principle of the thing, and 'cause you were pissed at the behavior. I totally agree and in your shoes would have felt the same way, but with lots more profanity and obscene albet lyrical phrases <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
But here's my opinion, from someone who played EQ waaaaaaay too long. Someone like that ends up fucking up their own game. People eventually see them for who they are and they end up either quitting because they can't play with others and they've destroyed their rep...they end up seeing how badly certain actions fuck up their game and stop being a prick for short term gain, or they move/change characters.<br>
<br>
Karma ends up biting them in the ass and they're their own worst enemy yadda yadda. Which I'm sure makes it all better for you....I know it doesn't. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :\ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":\"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
But the only resolution I can think of that <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> would</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> be fair to you is to suggest a multi quest. Now we haven't even heard from Ghon yet...but Simc said based on what she's seen here, and the information you sent her, she would <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> strongly</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> recommend to him that he do that.<br>
<br>
So he either does it, and at least you're not screwed out of the item (which again I know it <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> not</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> your whole point, but it's the least that can be done to rectify it)<br>
<br>
Or he refuses, and then that tells Simc additional information as to who Ghon is and lets her and her guild have additional information to make whatever decision they need to make.<br>
<br>
Either way it won't change what happened, nothing can. But perhaps it's possible to at least have some amends made for it, even though I know that wasn't your point or purpose.<br>

Im gonna add my 2 cp here for future refererence, this is only the 2nd time we have been told with complaints about Ghon and will also back Simc up on the part that yes Ghon just recently joined RoA when the first SL was put up. <br>
<br>
I think the Simc, Errtai and the other officers have come up with a solution and it will be handled.<br>
<br>
To Tarot, im gonna repeat Simc, thank you, its hard to weed out the people that are not up to the caliber that is wanted in the guild...even harder when our name is not the greatest, and seems like everyother week i see another SL posted that and ROA member KSd/cheated someone,but we try our best, so thank you for the kind words =) (how's AO?)<br>
<br>
To Shur, man Im sorry this happened, I hope we come to a solution, and if you need help with fay throw me a tell, id be glad to help you.<br>
<br>
To others that have problems with RoA, here is who to contact.<br>

Simc<br>
Maxxim<br>
Solanthious<br>
Gusiam<br>
Erikia<br>

<br>
An officer is almost always on, if not, leave a message, I think we are trying our hardest to make RoA a respectable guild again, so we do need to know about things like this, and would like to avoid these postings, so contact one of us before you SL a member so we can deal with it.<br>

Like I said, I do believe there was a misunderstanding.  Ghon misunderstood 2 things.<br>
1.  HOW to spawn the Tainted<br>
2.  WHO spawned the Tainted<br>
<br>
Okay, fine, he didn't have all the facts.  Who can blame him.  However, those 2 misunderstandings are not why he's here.  He's here because he did understand who engaged the Tainted first, he did understand who killed the Tainted, and he did understand who spawned/engaged the Corrupted first and STILL he proceeded to steal the kill.<br>
<br>
I didn't say anything to him earlier for fear he would attempt to take over the spawn point I was camping (I'll be the first to admit, silence was probably not the best way to handle this situation).  Granted, since I didn't talk to him before hand, we'll never know what would have happened.  Things may have come out differently.  That doesn't change what happened.  He had plenty of time to act with honor and he failed to do that, hence the reason I have put him here.<br>

Quick things... <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>
we did not deal with the other stuff as he had just joined our guild and didn't have enough experiance with him to make judgement either way<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I have known of Simc for a very long time, as we were guilded together in Serenity... I don't write that to say that she should respect my opinion, but to say that I have known of her for a long time, and in that entire time she has always been one of the most respectable people I have come across.<br>
<br>
That being said... the above quote makes me wonder about how you recruit for your guild.  Personally, I can't fathom being in a guild that extended membership to anyone without getting to really know them, let alone someone with the history that Ghon has.<br>
<br>
Secondly... and again this is only my opinion, but let's face it... we do made mistakes on Epics, but this is something that has been printed and reprinted several times over.  Druids know the exact spot for where the barracuda spawns and they know exacly how to pop it.  His plea of misunderstanding or ignorance is simply not believable by any measurable standards.<br>
<br>
Lastly... we all have bad days, and can rub others the wrong way with our own little quirks and the like... but sometimes a spade is spade, and seasons for assholes like Ghon don't change.  Thanks Laaw for making that very clear.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

The reason it is lax is because we are generally pretty forgiving over someone's past issues.  Everyone deserves so much as an oppurtunity to become part of a good guild of friends, otherwise we will just turn into a closed-in closed-minded guild that never reaches out to others nor accepts other people's ideas about the game.   <p><center>
