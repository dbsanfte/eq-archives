Technically, anyway, though I have never felt that I was without a family. I don't know how much truth there is to this story, but this is way it was related to me growing up, and this is the way i must relate it to you now.<br>
<br>
I was found in the middle of the druid ring of the Lesser Faydark by a Faerie Maiden. Clenched in my right hand was a crudely whittled flute and in my left hand was a note indicating that whoever took me on and raised me as their own could keep the magic flute as payment. The faeries, being very skeptical of Pointed Ear folk, had little use for my kind and even less use for the magical flute. They decided that it would be in everyone's best interest to take me to the Songweavers of Kelethin in hopes that someone there would find my flute, and perhaps me, to be of some use. <br>
<br>
The faeries were greeted by Cryssia Stardreamer, who was at the time only an apprentice Bard, and a very poor bard at that. She was struggling to keep up her marks, but she lacked the natural talent required to be a good bard, and she was aware, as were the other Songweavers, that it would take more than mere training for Cryssia to ever bring honor up on the SOngweaver guild. Thus, when Cryssia saw the magic flute in my hand, she took it as a sign from Quellious that she was to take me in. However, she knew that the other Songweavers would be very skeptical of a foundling babe, so she reared me in secrecy as her own child, with the help of the faeries who kept me well stocked on milk and honey. <br>
<br>
The magic clute was indeed the turning point in Cryssia's studies. With that flute, she was the most charming bard to grace the Songweaver guild halls, and she quickly advanced through the ranks. So quickly, in fact, that she fell into the favor of the Temple of Solusek Ro, and called her to come work with them. Knowing that a child as young as I was was not prepared to make the dangerous travel to the Temple, and furthermore, knowing that she could not fulfill her calling with child in tote, she revealed me to the other bards of the guild, and asked that they take care of me, and train me in the Celestial Art of Music. <br>
<br>
The bards were skeptical. Having been found in the Lesser Faydark, the Elves were afraid that I might be part Brownie, or worse, part Bixie. (Have you heard Bixies attempt to sing? It is pure cacaphony!) But Cryssia was a charming elf if nothing else, and she convinced them I was a purely of the Wood Folk, so they took me in and trained me as one of their own. (It has never been proven,however, than i am not part Brownie!)<br>
<br>
They were very lenient with me, and allowed me free travel over The Greater Faydark. When I became of age, a fellow Bard named Kitkoran gave me a set of patchwork armor and a weapon and told me to go forth and learn the arts of Battle, for even Bards need to defend themselves. Soon afterward, the Bards presented me with my frist drum that I might travel quickly over the lands should I run into trouble. Being the precocious child that I was, I soon ventured into the far corners of the Faydark and ran into the Clan of Crushbone Orcs. Though I was defeated many, many times, each season brought to me greater skills in both Battle and Music.<br>
<br>
As I grew older, the Songweavers noticed my great propensity at the Art of Coquettery and likewise my growing Wanderlust. Knowing that this combination could be deadly, the Songweavers sent me on my way to Antonica under the watchful eyes of the League of Antonican Bards, where I still pledge my allegiance today.<br>
<br>
I have fond memories of Cryssia, my adoptive mother. I learned many things from her, but mostly I learned the power of being charming. It is a tool when used wisely, a weapon when wielding haphazardly. <br>
<br>
I leave you with a song.<br>
<br>
&quot;There is nothing like the Love of a Dwarf. There is nothing Finer!<br>
Imagine the lust of this burly young Dorf that lives his life as a Miner.<br>
Give him a beer, what ho, and hear<br>
the bellows as he guffaws!<br>
He'll hee and h'ell haw, he'll snort then withdraw<br>
To his quarters and at my breasts paw!<br>
<br>
&quot;There is nothing quite like a good Dwarf!<br>
Treat him well and h'ed give you his life!<br>
But be careful young lass, for he might pinch your ass<br>
And he's always out cheatin on his wife!<br>
<br>
&quot;Ode to a Dwarf. Oh, to love a Dwarf! <br>
Just keep him well stocked on ale.<br>
Then beat on his chest while he nuzzles your breast<br>
and on many adventures you'll sail.<br>
<br>
&quot;Frankly, as a Bard, I have to work hard, to keep these young hooligans at Bay.<br>
then I throw them a kiss, with a lick and a Hiss,<br>
and they'll do for me whate'er I say!<br>
Ho, for Kaladim! Ho, for Kaladim! to thee I surely drink! *takes a guzzle from a nearby beer jug*<br>
But one thing is true, and this I share with you....<br>
By Bristlebane, these Dwarves sure do Stink!&quot;<br>
