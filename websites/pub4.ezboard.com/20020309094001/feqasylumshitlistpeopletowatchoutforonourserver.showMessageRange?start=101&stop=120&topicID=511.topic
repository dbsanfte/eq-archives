I think the attempt of these characters to roleplay is respectable, but...EQ is NOT the real world, and  there are real people behind those characters.  You can roleplay without disrespecting those real people.<br>
<br>
Although I didn't see the thread before it was edited, any callous references to rape are insensitive and disrespectful.  You two (as people) are glowering dubiously to me right now and a *sincere* apology about that would help tremendously...<br>
<br>
If you choose to change you playstyle and attitudes to respect the people behind the characters more, you could possibly stay in EQ and become respected roleplayers on lanys.  If you don't, you are well on the way to being banned, and I don't think many would be sorry. <p><img src="http://alundraadjani.com/otherstuff/eq/sig3.jpg" alt="Adjani Tristesse, Goddess of Lanys"></img>

GREAT JOB!...it's working...judging form the replies, you two are on these people's nerves. I'm a roleplayer as well and I haven't seen anyone with this potential.

Some might say: &quot;That's just an excuse to get away with anything...&quot; Well we'll see...time and consistency will prove this...If after 40+levels and they still play like this then hey...these guys might really be &quot;roleplayers&quot;.<br>

What is happening is they will not be allowed into any type of raid/group (i could care less if you only group with eachother, you'll find troubles with that later on ( I hate stupid newbies)).

<br>
This was never a shot at their ability to roleplay. This had absolutely nothing to do with it. This was about them breaking the rules of this game. Go ahead, roleplay that you hate me all you like. I gives a rat's rear. But if you start doing stuff maliciously, that's against the rules and showing that this is no longer roleplay, then you've crossed the line.<br>
<br>
And on the subject of dueling: It doesn't stop them. It doesn't stop any asshole who wants to train/KS/etc. Why would you think this is an acceptable way of solving the problem, when it does nothing of the sort?<br>
<br>
I, personally, think you're a fucking idiot to be egging these two on. And you can duel me for that in game if ya want. I gives a fuck. I'm tired of immature, shrivelled-dick assholes who can't play the game worth a fuck and think that gives them license to ruin it for others.<br>
<br>
Gee, you think maybe there's a reason those two are stuck in their teens, while I'm in my high 20's? They were KSing me a few weeks ago. They couldn't even HIT the things I fight now. Shows how bad they suck at this in general.<br>

cause we do things that are malicious, whether you are too into game politics does not matter, you are foolish to think that an evil roleplaying character would be kind, if they are kind to goodly races under general circumstances they simply are not roleplaying. They are being a normal player or are playing a bad character gone good.  They are not playing a bad character. Just because you dont like what I do doesnt mean its poor roleplaying.

You're the one that doesn't seem to get it, ya little prick. You're breaking the rules of the game. Roleplaying is ALLOWED. Fine. Call me a faerie. Insult me.

KSing is not acceptable. Not by the players. Not by the GM's. Game politics has nothing to do with this.<br>
