Nope.  No politics.  Death penalty proponents don't argue the stat for it's the fact.  The cost of average death penalty case from charges through execution are well over $3,000,000.  Cost to keep the same guy in jail is $20-25,000 per year.<br>
<br>
2.  Most cases don't have these inarguable proofs.  In those cases that we do, there other reasons not to do it.<br>
<br>
3.  Life imprisonment without the possibility of parole is the same amount of deterrence to repeat offenses, with the ability to correct mistakes.<br>
<br>
4.  Loopholes don't hardly exist.  1 in 10,000 fall in a &quot;loophole,&quot; and they rarely get off completely.  And if you are in jail without possibility of parole, you don't get out because you are reformed.  Jail is hell.  It ain't the vacation spot you seem to think.  I've been there (Just Visiting), and that was bad enough.<br>
<br>
5.  That time may not be sufficient, and, like McVeigh, they might be too close to the event to have had time wear down their callousness.<br>
<br>
Undoubtedly your guess regarding repeat offenders verses innocents executed is correct.  But so what?  Just because there are fewer innocents than repeat offenders, does that justify the deaths of an innocent man?  Is it okay if that innocent is your brother, father, son?  [Playing the same emotion card as those that try and put you in the shoes of the victim's family.]<br>
<br>
Frankly, I'm not comfortable with killing an innocent, when there are adequate alternatives.  It is better that 10 guilty persons go unpunished, than one innocent man go to jail.  Add another 10 fold for an innocent man executed.  That's what the Bill of Rights is all about.  It's a shame we've lost sight of that. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uassilemsoulvenom.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Assilem Soulvenom</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 266<br> <font color=#E9D756>(6/13/01 1:13:50 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: way to go USA..</span><hr size=1> Darue, no I would not have sided with the germans and quite frankly saying something about me like that is highly offensive.  I will assume you said that in the heat of the moment and really didn't mean that statement to sound that way, and yes i know damn well what happened in both cases.<br>
<br>
Now if you will, I will explain futher what my statement was intended to mean since it was rather short.  Majority rule doesn't mean &quot;perfect&quot; or &quot;good&quot; rule.  It means that the popular vote determines laws and regulations.  This vote comes from the people, individuals that have a set of ideals and values which they use to determine their votes.  If the majority decides to do something evil then thats what is going to happen ie the nazi party, slavers etc...<br>
I did not say any where in my post that it made it right in everyones eyes, or just flat made it right, was just stating that we have the death penalty because we want it by majority, besides just because you or a few others think its an injustice why is everyone else so wrong for not thinking it is??  In saying that we are minority ruled, ie he who has the most money wins, why is you point of view so much better?  would you rather we all be mindless automations that can't think for themselves? or are you saying we already are?  if you had the money would we all think like you?   I think the people who actually vote are informed enough to make their own decisions,  if you don't like the result, try harder.  It seems to me you have no faith in the American public to do what is right.  <br>
      I honestly don't put capital punishment in the same ranks as genocide or slavery, those are extreme cases of social evils.  Out of curiosity though, if you had Hitler in you grasp or even a member of the nazi party, or a slaver that abused and tormented people, what would you do to them?  No one is going to argue that they aren't evil and morally wrong, so what punishment do they get for their crimes against humanity?<br>

there should be *NO* excuse for taking someones life, no matter what the person did. <br>

<br>
First of all, he is NOT a martyr. To be a martyr, there has to be a contingent of people, large enough to have a voice that can be heard, that miss you or really care that you were killed. While some disagree with his execution, no one will miss his sorry ass. No martyrdom for you!<br>
<br>
Second, do you want to know the truth behind executions, and why executions are likely to continue and are supported by the majority of U.S. citizens? Executions don't exist because they are the most appropriate punishment...they don't exist because of their deterrent factor...<br>
<br>
Executions exist because they satisfy us as a society. More then any other country in the world, the United States of America carries the firm belief, every day...in the heart's and mind's of most every citizen...that ABSOLUTELY NO ONE CAN FUCK WITH US. <br>
<br>
We are the United States of America. You killed one of our citizens. You fucked up. No one does that to us. Guess what? Now it's your turn. <br>
<br>
It's the belief of a society that enforces and encourages the death penalty. Attack part of that society, and you will incur the wrath...<br>
<br>
Attack someone in this country who doesn't fit into the societal belief...and no one cares. If Tim McVeigh bombed a crack house, killing 168 crack dealers and users...some people would have applauded him. And I seriously doubt he'd have gotten the death penalty. <br>
<br>
But, attack members of not only our citizenship BUT more importantly our society...and all bets are off. We'll kill you if we can. <br>
<br>
The death penalty is an act of healing and vengeance that brings our society closer together and enforces the belief that no one has a right to attack us on our own soil. <br>
<br>
Every country in Europe has tasted the blood and ashes of war, and recently enough to remember it. They have also learned the lesson that in order to get along with their neighbors, they can't dwell on it.  <br>
<br>
The only real attack on U.S. soil in modern times was Pearl Harbor...and as a society, we still haven't let that go. Unless something drastic changes, we will never accept an attack on us casually. It will always be met with an uproar and cry for swift vengeance. <br>
<br>
For right or wrong, that's the way it is. We are who we are. You can disagree with us, but attack us, and we'll kill you.<br>

You are absolutely right.  No one can fuck with us, which is something we shove into their faces at every opportunity.  Do it our way, on our timeline, with no compromise or we'll blow the fuck out of you.  Period.            <br>

<br>
I have never once said where I stood on the issue of what happened or is happening..<br>
<br>
Frankly because I dont know, It is all case by case on my part.<br>
<br>
And Assilem, the death penalty is only truely an injustice if one gets pleasure(be it in the form of vengenace or revenge) from another death.<br>
<br>
 And as far as mindless automatations thing<br>
--would you rather we all be mindless automations that can't think for themselves? or are you saying we already are?--<br>
<br>
 do you feel that there should be someone to control what you see and dont see on the internet? on television?(V-Chip), read in books? magazines?(censorship) if so, then we allready are.<br>
<br>
But I know I do NOT like to hear about how this man or that man was innocent and locked up for the last ten years before they actually found out he was innocent..that troubles me, for that could be anyone of us who were in the wrong place at the wrong time..and to execute an innocent man on the same presumptions...well, place yourself in that persons shoes, or maybe put those shoes on your wife, son, daughter, father, mother etc.<br>
<br>
The legal system in America has problems...major problems.<br>
It is filled with corrupt individuals in high places that can determine who lives and who dies, granted that there are some honest people but the fact remains. One error and now someone else is greiving for the loss of a loved one that did absolutly nothing to begin with.<br>
<br>
Im just saying, that before everyone jumps on the bandwagon for capital punishment across the board, there must be stricter checks and balances put into place in the American judicial system. <br>
<br>
Because I DO beleive that if a man is found innocent AFTER he is put to death, all those who helped put him there(judges, attorneys, prosecutors, police, governement officials,etc) should be held accountable and made to suffer the same consequences that they so deemed forth by playing god with that persons life.<br>
<br>
Like I said before..man has killed man for the last few thousand years, and we are the intelligent species..One could teach monkey's to behave better in a shorter time.<br>

All that is needed to create a martyr are a group of people that believe what the martyr was killed for was right.  The first Christian martyr, Steven, was created when there were very few followers of Christ.  The same can be said for other &quot;martyrs&quot; of all sorts of beliefs and ideologies.<br>
<br>
If you don't think there is a portion of this country that doesn't hold McVeigh as a martyr, you haven't been paying attention to any media other than the mass media.  There are a large number within the gun and militia movements that think his message (if not always his methods) were right.  They hold him up as a martyr.  Same with Buford Furrow.<br>
<br>
Your argument regarding the crack dealers is exactly why the death penalty is a terrible thing.  Anytime a punishment is meted out based upon who you are and who you killed, rather than merely on the basis of what you did, something is seriously wrong.  The very idea is anathema to the Bill of Rights and Equal Protection under Law.<br>
<br>
Arguing in favor of the death penalty regarding such an extreme case as McVeigh is unrealistic due to the unusual circumstances of his crimes and his admission.  But what about the retarded guy in Texas that had his attorney sleep through half the trial?  Because he doesn't understand what is going on, and his attorney wasn't paying attention, is it right that we off the poor fuck?  I don't think so.  Stick him in an institution forever?  Sure.  But killing him? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uwyvernwyrmsong.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Wyvern Wyrmsong</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_redspot.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 88<br> <font color=#E9D756>(6/13/01 9:27:47 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: way to go USA..</span><hr size=1> Darue, the reason it is against the law to commit suicide is so authorities have a reason to lock up someone who is trying to kill themself.  If someone is trying to off themselves and someone tries to intervene, what can a cop say.  &quot;Sorry, they can kill themselves, it's a free country.&quot;  Laws like this are designed to protect people from themselves.  <br>
<br>
Since most agree killing yourself is an irrational act, society decided to create laws giving the power to the government to intervene on that person's behalf.  Without such a law, the govt. would lack the ability to do anything.  <br>
<br>
As for assisted suicide of terminal cases, there is a fine line there as well.  I think Dr. Kevorkian is an idealist willing to fight for what he believes in, namely, raising awareness of quality of life over quantity.  The problem with allowing assisted suicide, is how do you regulate it?  Doctors get sued when they save someone's life, but did not do it perfectly.  Someone is SURE gonna pay if they help grandma die when she is 98 and in constant agony and begging to die but cannot even move to grab a gun, because &lt;gasp&gt; you deprived them of grandma's company.  Then you would also have countless claims of abusing assisted suicide.  Someone talked them into doing it, and oh by the way, they inherit their estate, etc.  Throw in religious beliefs about suicide, and you have an legislative issue which would be very tricky to word, and unpopular with a lot of constituents == no law for assisted suicide.<br>

Now don't get me wrong, I don't agree with a lot of the things we stick our nose in(where it is neither desired nor required) or when we fail to step in when we should (Bosnia's &quot;Ethnic Cleansing&quot; e.g.).  But at the bottom line, I don't want us to be the agressors (that's why I am in a military that &quot;defends our country&quot;, not &quot;picks fights like a bully&quot;) but you strike at us, yer gonna pull back a stump. <p>Soulslicer DE SK<BR>

<br>
Right now there is really no deterent for criminals to not commit crimes. If i kill this person i may get life in prison be out in 15 yrs when im up for poral, BUT while im in prison i get cable t.v., 3 meals a day, to socialize with a like minded group of people.<br>
<br>
I think it is about time we brought back PUBLIC EXECUTIONS. Of course, there are pro's and con's to everything and public executions have them also, but at some point we are going to have to make a stand and try to make the public as a whole realize that this is wrong and this is what happens when u do this.<br>

  <br>
Firstly,  no matter what country you live in, people are accused and convicted of crimes they did not commit. That is nothing new, and I'm sure it will continue as we are all human and do make errors.  <br>
<br>
Secondly, capitol punishment is not in the same category as war.  Comparing this to Hitler, or what happened in Japan is like comparing apples to oranges, theyr'e simply two different things.<br>
<br>
Thirdly, yes the American justice system is messed up. It has been and will continue to be, however... I'm certain it's not the only one in the world that is messed up. No, that doesn't mean we shouldn't try to change it, it just means that we're like every other country in that respect.<br>
<br>
<br>
Is capitol punishment right? &quot;An eye for an eye a tooth for a tooth&quot;.... lets see where that came from. The bible.  Jesus didn't kill anyone, he forgave everyone for their sins, that's true....... God on the other hand.  Sodom and Ghamora anyone? How many innocent people lived there and died to punish the wicked masses?  Is it punishment? No, it's not punishment. I punish my daughters to teach them, you can't very well learn if you're dead. Is it vengence? For some maybe.. for the guy that flips the switch or gives the injection, no , it's his job, there's no vengence in it for him. Is it &quot;closure&quot;? It may bring closure for some, but that's not it either. <br>
    So what is capitol punishment? Why do we keep it?  Despite what Arnwolf says, it's not about showing people they can not fuck with us and get away with it. Not everyone in the U.S. thinks that way. Capitol punishment is here to eliminate from society the worst type of person there is. Someone who takes no concern for human life.<br>
   Could we lock them away in prison forever? Of course we could, and we do in many many cases. Our prisons are full of people serving life sentences for one reason or another. <br>
  Here is something else for you to think about.... people escape prison. I personally would not like to take the chance, however minute it may be that someone with the mental ability to kill hundreds of innocent people in cold blood could escape from his cell so that he can continue in his war against the government.  yes, I know that's one case, and not everyone is on death row for bombing the federal building, but you can bet all those there that weren't wrongly accused are there for a very bad reason.  They have all done things that are deserving of their death.  Not to punish them, to teach them, but to make damn sure they can never hurt anyone to that extent again.<br>
<br>
To whomever it was that was talking about putting innocent people to death along with the guilty, you're right it's wrong to do, those are innocent people that dont' deserve to die. To use that as a basis for eliminateing the death penalty? No, I'm sorry that doesnt' do it for me. The men, women, and children murdered by the guilty people on death row for the vast majority were innocent people too.<br>
<br>
Prison is not a deterent, there is no hard labor there, there is no contributing to society from prison. For the most part the worst thing about prison is having to live with the other inmates. 3 meals a day, tv, exercise and an education is not a deterent.  <br>
If we were to enlist some of the practices used 100 years ago... that would be a deterent. Make prison a place where you do have to work hard, make it a punishment, instead of merely a confinement.<br>
<br>
To everyone that has come here saying the things that they think should have been done to McVeigh, instead of the death penalty... and there were quite a few vivid examples, I agree with you, there is nothing he can be taught now, and no way to make him pay for the aweful things he did.  There is no way to make him feel the suffering thousands of people have felt because of his actions, no way for him to ever understand the pain he caused.  Do I think he should have died? Yes, I do. He was a poor excuse for a human being, and was taking up precious oxygen.  Would I have given the injection myself? Absolutely. Would I be playing God if I had? Nope, i'd be playing a mother, which I am. There is nothing i wouldnt' do to protect my daughters from scum like that.<br>

That's not quite logical, is it?  Not many escapees from maximum security prisons.  Those 6 from Texas killed one person.  That was one too many, but that doesn't justify killing other innocently convicted persons to prevent it.<br>
<br>
As for the &quot;eye for an eye&quot; deal, contextually and historically, that was quite a step down from the practice that was being done.  The doctrine was promulgated to replace the ever escalating violence that was the rule of the day, much like the Middle East and Northern Ireland today.  It was offered as a means to express a more even response and try and get off the cycle of vengence and retribution.<br>
<br>
As for Sodom &amp; Gomorrah, reread the text.  The angel looked for one moral person, and found not one aside from Lot and his family.  Then the place was nuked.<br>
<br>
As for deterrence, the studies all show (no matter who conducts them) that the reason capital punishment isn't a deterrent is because criminals don't think they'll get caught.  Making it hard labor or drawn &amp; quartered wouldn't change anything, because they don't think they'll get caught.  Simple as that. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ubhritsoulvenom.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bhrit Soulvenom</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 32<br> <font color=#E9D756>(6/13/01 12:59:24 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: way to go USA..</span><hr size=1> Raedwulf, did you even read what I said? <br>
Yes it is wrong for innocent people to die. I agree with that. You are trying to make it seem that I said  it's ok to kill innocent people on death row if it saves one life..... that is not what I said. There is no way to know how many people's lives have been saved, there is also no way to know how many innocent people have been put to death wrongly. I was pointing out that the people killed by those inmates on death row were just as innocent and did not deserve to die. The death penalty is not a means of punishment, it's a means of making the world a safer place by eliminateing the vermin. If someone like McVeigh escaped, there would be a lot more than one life lost.<br>
<br>
<br>
An eye for an eye... was merely to reference the bible and show that God himself believed in the death penalty.<br>
<br>
As for Sodom and Gomorrah... Lot's wife died did she not? turned to a pillar of salt for looking back, there's at least one innocent person. Many people now days are morally corupt that doesn't mean they deserve to die.<br>
<br>
As for Deterence, I never said capital punishment was a deterent. I said our prison system AS IT IS is not a deterent either. I didn't say anything about being drawn and quartered.  <p>Bhrit Soulvenom</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uzariel.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Zariel</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 48<br> <font color=#E9D756>(6/13/01 1:53:17 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: way to go USA..</span><hr size=1> This goes way back to something Scoppie said, sorry all.  Scop, whether or not one is raped has nothing to do with how attractive one is.<br>
Fact: rape is not about sex.  Rape is about power.  Date rape, stranger rape, it doesn't matter.  A rapist doesn't go out looking for the prettiest person he can find.  A rapist looks for the most likely victim.  It really doesn't matter what she (or in some cases, he) looks like.  A rapist isn't just forcing a sexual act on someone, they are having a fucking power trip that they can't get from just beating someone, although they do that too a lot of the time.<br>
Rapists should be castrated.  Period.  That's the only fitting punishment.  Three cheers for the woman in Chicago who bit off her attacker's testicles.  I'm glad the doctors couldn't reattach them.<br>
