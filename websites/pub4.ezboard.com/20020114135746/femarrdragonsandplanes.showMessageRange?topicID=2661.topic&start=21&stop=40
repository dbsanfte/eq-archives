First off, It is still rude to inspect without asking. I wouldn't dream of inspecting someone in real life, why would I in game.<br>
I have my inspect message set to tell beggars:<br>
<br>
Yes I have buffs, but if you are reading this before asking you aren't gonna get any.<br>
<br>
I have never beged for gear in my entire 55 lvl's<br>
<br>
And generally specking I offer to pay for buffs<br>
Contrary to popular belief, MANA is NOT free. It takes time to med up, and for me, my play time is valuable considering how long it takes to travel in game and how long it takes to gain levels post lvl 50.<br>
I have two sides to me. First one is the shaman that when done farming will take the stuff I dont want to sell or use for twinks and find one of those true noobs and give em stuff. You know the ones, they always look lost and are looting everything that dies.<br>
The other side is the guy that likes to take FS weapons and some low level magic weapons and run around WFP and give all the orcs and skellies stuff. /evil grin<br>
it is unfortunate that Shamans/druids/chanters/clerics can't stop and stay for long in noob zones without being slammed with beg spam. I have no real problem with buffing and helping true noobs, afterall someone did it to me, but I think it is far more satisfying gaining stuff the old fashioned way.<br>

I have been playing this game sense Aug. of 99.  I can remember when I had my Necro and was 5th level and was able to kill my first skeleton solo and this high level guy inspects me and give me a pair of wolfhide boots.  I remember I was so happy and bragged to a bunch of my friends that I hade wolfhide boots and was cool that had some good gear.  Now I say this because about 3 weeks ago I was in EC trying to sell a jade mace I had when I get a tell from some 12th level warrior who ask me if I can give him the jade mace.  I thought he was joking and so I responed &quot;yeah right.  LOL =)&quot;.   Then he responds back that there is no need to get rude and that the item was no use to me so I should just give it to him.  All I could this is WTF.  I can not even imagine what the hell someone is thinking when they ask this.  I was just amazed he would ask I thought that was in bad taste.  You know not all high level poeple are Helius Wallace rich. (Can you feel the love.  Just had to pick on you. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  )<br>
    To all noobs out there.  Play the game, get xp, meet people and make friends with all the dam time you spend begging.  I am not here to be your sugar daddy.  I love to help people but do not beg.  If I respect you I will help you.  I do not respect people that beg over and over again.  Thanx for listeing to my rant.<br>

what the hell kinda qquestion is that? i shouldn't need to repay anyone for losses im not responsible for...<br>
<br>
the most things people beg me for isnt usually money, its pretty much just people wanting PLs and i tell them NO, and they ask me why not...<br>
<br>
maybe because i don't play this game so other people can have all the fun and gain levels the quik and easy way, while i sit stand around buffing and healing them, wasting the little time i have.<br>

if im gunna waste my time playing a game, i might as well be the one benefiting from the time spent.<br>

That's classic. :P<br>
<br>
As far as the inspections go, I don't particularly like it either, but not everyone thinks it's rude, and I don't want to punish people for my personal pet peeves.  The person that introduced me to this game is one of the nicest players I've met, but he still inspects everyone just out of curiosity.  Plus, the char I've been playing now is a FEMALE troll sk, which always piques peoples curiosity, since I think there are about... 5 of us. :P<br>
<br>
I also just can't figure out what goes through peoples heads when they ask questions like that.  Like the person who had someone ask him for a jade mace, or the mage who had someone ask her for all that extra stuff... what the hell are you thinking?!  Does the fact that you're a loser ever enter your mind?  Sheesh.  <br>
<br>
I've also never begged.  I just could not bring myself to do it.  I could never even bring myself to ask for donations for ports and such... My sk now is the one who has to stop a shaman everytime she wants to go to the bank from LOIO to request a sow and lev, and I feel SO awkward doing it!  I donate well (when they accept it)  but I remember so vividly how annoying those kinds of tells got on my druid.  <br>
<br>
And I got my first sow request yesterday on the troll. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   A troll in full maroon colored plate armor, with a skeleton standing next to her calling her Master, and a level 23 erudite caster asked me for sow.

I had just bought some cobalt arms, so I was trying to sell my old crafted arms.  Some one sent me a tell asking how much, i told her how much, and she said she had half that and thanks anyway.  Well next thing I see is her asking if anyone had any halfing warrior arms for sale.. When i realized she was a fellow haffer warrior i told her i would give her the arms for the money she had.  Upon seeing her gear was all leather, rawhide etc, no banded, and she was lvl 20, i told her to wait a sec, i had something for her on another char.<br>
I logged on my black smith and decked her out in banded, then realized that i had my crafted boots in the bank, I gave her everything but the arms for free.  She was very very grateful.  It was nice to find a true newbie that was apreciative.  Someone did something similiar for me with my first char, and it was nice to return the favor in a round about way.<br>
Incidentyly when Toein mentioned farming in his post above, he was talking about farming exp his group earns while he is afk... just ask him about FM and DL back in his baby shamen days...<br>

<br>
buffs i don't mind so much, i give them sow on my boots, thorns on my gloves, and rotg on my bp, it's those that want the 1200 mana per cast potg buff that i want to kick.  or the ones who ask for regen repeatedly yet won't hit follow, even after i explain that rotg is a group only buff. (group buffs as effects on items do not work with the new /targetgroupbuff on btw).<br>

oh and the best one is those who tell me i don't need an item cus i'm lvl 60 or that i am rich cus i'm lvl 60.  just so everyone knows, i have 102pp in the bank and everything on me is NO DROP, and none of those things were bought or chained for me, i earned them all from raiding w/ my guild.  i can do it, means you can too.<br>

HA!..Why do I always think of like CLOCV volunteers when I get approached by one? Ever seen a CLOCV volunteer? (California League of Conservation Voters) Half of em walk up in thier Dockers and 200 dollar tennis shoes and ask you for cash for their cause. Well they are probably way more polite than the beggers in EQ, but if you knock thier cause you will get deja vu! <br>
<br>
Have a story of a single begger. He sees me first in a dungeon and offers me all of his paladin quest armor for Shieldstorm, which I had just bought and was testing, was my only 2hs and I am not rich. I felt sorry for him and answered that his BP and a couple items were easily worth the money for a ss and that I bought this more for raids where I could use the extra saves. Told him he should sell a couple pieces and get himself an Arbitors combine if he wanted a decent 2hs. I gave him a couple items I had just to be cool.<br>
<br>
Next Time I see him he says &quot;Give me that Sword!&quot; and starts gettin pushy and repeatedly demanding that I loan it to him.<br>
Whatcha gonna do with these guys?<br>

When I first started playing, I met someone in BB, Teer a cleric.  He (in RL) befriended me and would often show up with a ring with 2 int or some other small thing in thanks for helping him with things.  I thought I was the shit even though I later learned that those items were small and cost genearlly not a lot.  It was nice to get but I never asked him for anything.<br>
<br>
Since then, I have tried to repay that kindness to other true newbies when I see them, which is not often.  When I am in NFP working on my tailoring I will look for new monks and give them the wu's I am making instead of selling it to a vendor.  Or, if I get something off a mob that I think someone could use, instead of dropping it, I will often shout to the zone to come and get it someone.<br>
<br>
Recently though, I have had some very bad expierences with this.  I was in NRO and some shield dropped off a mob.  It was a decent shield for a young player, so I shouted to the zone to come get it.  Well a guy showed up for it and I gave it to him, then notieced that he was duel weapon equipped and had better armour than he should have for his level.  He did not equip the shield, did not say thanks, just ran off.  Then, while in NFP a day latter, a young level 1 cleric came begging me for items or pp.  She was very polite and nice and was begging nicely.  I should have had a clue from the fact that she was a level 1 High Elf in NFP (I dont think I went that far from Felwithe till I was at least level 10).  SInce she was not being rude, I said I would give her something that she could sell to buy her spells or something, but that I had nothing a cleric could really use.  SO since I was again practicing my tailoring skills, I gave her a Wu's shirt.  Two seconds later she is shouting to the zone PC on Wu's fighting shirt please.  THen I knew.  ahh well.<br>
<br>
But the best one lately was a couple of weeks ago, again in NFP where a young bard was begging everyone there for pp and items.  The entire zone got so tired of it that they were telling her off.  She never got it, and kept right on harassing folks.  SOmeone told her that in the time she was wasteing begging, she could have gotten some exp and some plat by killing something (oh my, what a novel idea), and she still did not get it.  Finally my guild mate, a level 53 bard, went up to her and started chatting.  She was of course begging him also, and he led her on and messed with her a bit.  When he inspected her, he found she was twinked!  GO figure that one. THen when he royaly told her off, and sort of bugged her a bit to show her what it feels like to be harassed, she threatedned to report him to the GM!<br>
<br>
And what is with this thought that every person who wears a dress can cast clarity?  I have gotten so many requests for that lately.  I will port in to a zone, at the wizard spires, right in front of someone (should be the first clue) and they will say Hail, then they will say can I plz have a clarity?  Do they even bother to do a /who first?  I told one guy the other day, sorry, no I cant cast that, and he said then how bout a breeze? !!!!!!!  Just because you wear a dress does not mean you can cast clarity.  My bard guild mate has an item that does illusion wearwolf.  Lately he gets asked for clarity a lot also.  How many of us have seen enchanters running around as wearwolfs, NOT in a newbie zone for the fright purposes?  That is a buff you cast on tanks or melee types, not on yourself!  /boggle<br>
<br>
Ah well, time to get off my soap box.  I just really am starting to hate people who beg and my message to them is normally, and I think from now on will be, &quot;I worked for what I have, please try to do the same and stop shaming the world of EQ with your pitifull begging&quot;.<br>

On a lighter note...I have actually gotten some lv 20ish monk to type /d for donate...He hauled ass as soon as he saw the message,  I didnt even get to whack em.

She told me that he was playing Everquest and so I told her to have him create a charcter in EMarr so that we can help him get started.<br>
<br>
When he finally made his char (high elf paladin I believe) I had my RL stop what he was doing and log in his blacksmithing twink.  We got him fully outfitted and gave him some decent hand me down weapons.  Then I PLed him to about level 4.<br>
<br>
A few days later I get a tell from him that he's trading one of the swords we have him for better armor.  I felt a little weird seeing that my brother had taken a lot of time out to get him stuff, but whatever.  Minutes later I get a tell from the kid again saying that now he was way too heavy with his new armor and he needed another sword to replace the one he sold.  I was laughing out loud but then felt sorry for him and offered to PL him some more.  He said no thanks, that he'd rather me get him another sword.  /ignore<br>
<br>
He also never checks to see where I am before asking me to pass by to buff him and give him money.  When I tell him I'm on a raid in xxxx (some place deep inside another continent) he tells me to ask a druid to port me to him and back to the raid!!  /ignore yet again<br>
<br>
Last I heard from him he lost two items during a trade somehow.  Haa haa haa.<br>
<br>
In high traffic zones I always go /role and when that doesn't work I sometimes even have to put up an /afk message.     <p><IMG SRC=http://www.shikasta.org/images/Olalogoca2.jpeg

Please stop giving in to these beggars!  That kid I mentioned has managed to get some nice items by begging which is why he keeps doing it.  He figures that if strangers give him stuff that I definitely should since I know him.<br>
