<br>
Allow me to be the first to give you some very good information on this game.  This is coming for the PC *and* the Playstation 2.  Both will be online.<br>
<br>
Matek's Website - <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.mamak-int.com/index_ffonline.php">www.mamak-int.com/index_ffonline.php</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
If this doesnt show up on the first try, just refresh.  LIVE CAM IN-GAME HERE! =)<br>
<br>
RPG-Gamer Movies - <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.rpgamer.com/games/ff/ff11/ff11mov.html">www.rpgamer.com/games/ff/...11mov.html</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
This has a couple movies in-game, and the *very* good introduction.  It's in English, too!  I thought the intro movie was pretty great.   The behemoths are gigantic in-game like that as well! =)<br>
<br>
<br>
  This is what I've read so far about the game.  I will go into detail as much as I can but I'm not very good at this. =)<br>
<br>
CLASS SYSTEM:<br>
<br>
  For those familiar with Final Fantasy, it will have quite a few classes from Final Fantasy Tactics, including the Red Mage from the NES versions.  Those I can think of off-hand are these:<br>
<br>
  Black Mage ( EQ Wizard ), White Mage ( EQ Cleric ), Thief, Dragon Knight a.k.a. Dragoon ( A aeriel-knight who specialized in dragon hunting ), Bard, Monk, Hunter (Ranger), Dark Knight, Beastmater... and more I cannot think of.  Summoners, I am not sure of.  I've seen a few screenshots of a Hume ( Human Race ) summoning Ifrit...<br>
<br>
  For those familiar with Final Fantasy Tactics, it will use the &quot;support job&quot; method. &quot;Job&quot; basically means &quot;Class&quot;. For instance, you can train in all classes ( I am pretty sure, but may be wrong ) but you can only be one class at full strength, and your Support Job ( Your Second Class ) is at half its full strength.  <br>
<br>
  Example!  Say you are trained enough to be a level 20 warrior, white mage, and black mage.  If you wanted to be a warrior with healing magic, you would be a Level 20 Warrior, with a Support Job of a White Mage at *LEVEL 10*.  You would not be able to cast any spells that, say, a level 15 White Mage could cast.  If you reversed Jobs, you would have all your White Mage spells, but only half of the warrior skills. ( Taunt wouldnt be as effective, ect. )<br>
<br>
  You are capable of changing classes only in your Mog House.  Supposedly you can add furniture, and customize it to your liking, as well as store equipment.  So, don't expect to change classes in the middle of a dungeon or fight!<br>
<br>
RACES AND CHARACTER CREATION:<br>
<br>
  There are the following PC races in FFXI:<br>
<br>
  &quot;Hume&quot; (Male/Female) - You should be able to tell, right?  Humans, with a new name.  Male and Females are both playable.  Size is medium.<br>
  &quot;Elvaan&quot; (Male/Female) - This is the last rip-off name.  The elven race.  Both Male/Female Playable as well.  Size is Medium.<br>
  &quot;Tarutaru&quot; (Male/Female) - This is the spellcaster race.  They excel in spellcasting, but other races are capable of playing caster classes I believe. Small in Size.<br>
  &quot;Mithra&quot; (Female) - This is a cat race.  Females are only playable by players.  Quick and fierce.  The males of the race are hardly ever seen outside of thier society. Medium Size.<br>
  &quot;I-Can't-Remember-It's-Name&quot; (Male/Female) - The large, rough looking race.  Makes the best fighters, obviously.  Large race.<br>
<br>
  Each race is about as customizable as EverQuest is.  You can change thier face and hair at this point.  Rumored that you will be able to change more than that, however.   Characters will have racial stat adjustments like in EverQuest.  It uses Str, Dex, Cha, Int, Wis, ect in the same manner as well.<br>
<br>
AREAS AND CITIES:<br>
<br>
  Supposedly the zones are similar to DaoC.  There's no real zoning involved in most of the game.  The area's are supposed to be large enough to get lost in.  A few screenshots I've seen of a forest looks rather realistic.  Think of Kithicor at night time.  The forest I saw was similar, but without all the undead. =P  There are various landscapes... Snowy tundra, ocean shores, mountain area's...  And the weather effects are pretty realistic I've seen.<br>
<br>
  Towns:<br>
     San O'Doria<br>
     Windurst<br>
     <br>
  There are more than just these two of course, but I cannot recall the names.  They are large towns, each with crafting guilds, government buildings, shops, and some interesting things like an airship dock. =)  Airships are in the game, and a video I had showed the airship dock in Windurst.  Chocobo's ( A gigantic yellow bird you ride like a horse ) are also in-game, although they cost cash.  There's another requirement that's something along how *famous* you are, or your standing with the people.<br>
<br>
TRADE SKILLS:<br>
<br>
  Final Fantasy XI will have trade skills, of course.  Crystals ( From Final Fantasy 2 ) will play a role in crafting.  There are several types of crystals first of all.  Fire, Ice, Water, Earth, Dark, Light, Air, and others.  I'm guessing adding a Fire crystal into a sword will give it a fire effect.  Or a certain combination will do a little more than just that?  *Shrugs*<br>
<br>
  There are, of course, the trade skills we are familiar with.  Blacksmithing, Tanning ( Tailoring ), Baking ( Tied with Fishing I believe ), Jewelry Crafting, and a few more.  There is a specific one that caught my eye. BONEWORKING!  So expectmonsters to yield crafting items.<br>
<br>
GROUPING:<br>
<br>
  I am unsure how many people are capable of being in a group together, but it is 5 or more I am *sure*.  There is also a capability that will link *groups* together as one group to take out boss monsters.<br>
<br>
  Guilds are available for players to create.  But I am unsure how you go about creating one.<br>
<br>
EQUIPMENT AND MONEY:<br>
<br>
  Here's a link on Matek's site.<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://mamak-int.com/idb/viewitem.php?game=ffxi&type=54">mamak-int.com/idb/viewite...xi&type=54</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
  Money will be rough to earn, supposedly.  Magical items are rumored to be rare.  It sounds like the making of a good economy to me!  This is all the information I have on equipment and coin so far.<br>
<br>
<br>
( Am I forgetting anything?  I have to be!  I havn't slept yet and its almost 8:00 AM! )<br>
<br>
<br>
MUSIC ( For those who care):<br>
<br>
  There are supposed to be town themes.  I have Windurst and San D'oria currently.. and it is excellent.  The Live Cam has actual in-game music, if you're wondering how good it is.<br>
<br>
  If anyone would like either of these two tracks, just send me an E-Mail at Mal-akite-Aqua-blaze@-hotmail.com.    ( Remove the -'s.. I dont want Ez Board sending me junkmail... yet! =p )<br>
