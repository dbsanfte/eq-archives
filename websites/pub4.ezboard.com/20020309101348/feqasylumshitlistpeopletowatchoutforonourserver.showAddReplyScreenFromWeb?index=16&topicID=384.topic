<br>
I have had a run in with Dirtt.  My partner and I were camping Halv in SF.  Dirtt pops in like he just logged on.  I inform him that Halv was camped, but that he was welcome to the camp when we were done.  Dirtt tells us that he wasn't after the camp, and that he didn't need Halv.  He was red to me, so I took his word.   About 3 mins later Halv pops, in the time it took me to stand up, Dirtt had already begun to blast him.  My partner and I tried to out blast him (at the time she was 30 I was 34) but we could not keep up.  After looting Halv,  Dirtt comes over to gloat.  I asked him why he lied to and KS'd me.  He only laughed at us and told me to relax.  I tried to reason with him, he only made fun of us.  I then threatened talk to his guild about the matter.  Upon hearing that he quickly logged.<br>
<br>
 About 2 mins later Dirtt comes back.  I informed him that I was speaking with an officer of TSO about his actions.  He then claimed to have no knowledge of what he just did.   He claimed that it was his &quot;friend&quot; with whom he shares an account.   While Dirtt was blabbering about how the incident was not his fault he mentioned the names of his alts.  One of which my partner and I grouped with on a few occasions when we both played other classes (many moons ago).  Now let me make one point very clear, Dirtt DID NOT know who we are.  He was never a friend, he was just some one with whom we grouped a few times.  After speaking with the TSO officer and having a few mins. to cool off, I told the TSO officer to drop the matter and that I wouldn't pursue it as long as it was an isolated incident.<br>
<br>
It appears that this was not an isolated incident, or that Dirtt is letting his friend on his account again.  Regardless of who is at the controls, Dirtt is the character committing these offences.<br>
<br>
TSO was completely honorable about the whole affair.  They responded quickly to my request to speak with them, and they seemed genuinely concerned with the problem I had with one of their members.  This is in NO WAY a slam on them.<br>

Besides based on my encounter I didn't think he should be on the poopie list.  and Jademist wasn't in a guild at the time.<br>
<br>
And while Dirtt was only buffing and such he left his guild tag up, no biggy since he wasn't doing anything bad.  But before the arguing and claiming 2 camps started he went anoun from roleplay, there by hiding his guild tag.  Too late my alt already saw the guildtag, besides a /guildstatus will give the guild even if you are anoun.  I have friends in and have grouped with may from his guild and just thought he would play up to the same standard that the rest did.  But I never bothered the officers, since I didn't think it was a big deal , my atls enounter with Jademist and Dirtt.  It was just typical HH crap.  I am sure if you all think back to your days in HH and the keep stuff like camp arguements and stuff happened all the time, which is why I never really liked hunting there.  Camp aruguments and KSing really turn me off to this game and I tend to camp and go watch TV or read or something else instead. <p><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#FF00FF"><b><I>Tsulyra Shadowhawk</I></b></font><br>

<br>
I think it might be a good idea at this point to make an FAQ with guidelines and steps to be taken before shitlisting a person. Just saying &quot;posts that don't belong here will be deleted&quot; is not enough - way too vague, and it won't stop premature or inappropriate posting.<br>
<br>
To make everyone see it, put a link to this FAQ in giant flashing letters at the top of this board so that anyone who might ever post can and will see it.<br>
<br>
Make it something like the following:<br>
<br>
If player x does something bad to you, before posting here do the following:<br>
<br>
1. Guilded players<br>
a. Turn on logging. As much as these can be forged, etc., the guildleaders/officers can compare your log with that of others in the situation and get a better idea of what is going on.<br>
b. See if the person is in a guild (he/she may be anon, so you might not know by just looking at the tag). If in a guild, do a /w all &lt;guildname&gt; or even a /guildstatus player x if anon just to be sure.<br>
c. Contact a random member of the guild listed and ask for the name of the leader or an officer who is online (unless you know the guildleader or an officer). Discuss the situation. Keep logging on during the discussion so you have something to look at later if you still feel you need to post. (looking back to see if the situation was resolved as best it could be for the time being might hold of your post for a while, plus, people have selective memories. read the log again and MAKE SURE)<br>
d. If the guild leaders/officers were not responsive to your request for discussion, post to their web page BEFORE POSTING HERE. If they do not have a web page, give it another day and try and contact them through tells, etc. (trying different guild members to ask for leaders/officer names for the sake of accuracy)<br>
e. If for some strange reason, none of the above steps produce any results within a weeks time, continue on to step 3.<br>
<br>
2. Unguilded players<br>
a. Turn on logging (to help you write your post, if you make one. BE SURE that you were not inflaming the situation and making it worse. BE SURE that you have given the other person the benefit of a doubt)<br>
b. Try and discuss the situation with the person in question. (the GMs will ask you to if you didn't)<br>
b. Petition the situation with a /report of some of what the player is saying that you find offensive or unjust, or that adds strength to your reason for petitioning.<br>
(instructions and general guidelines for petitioning, reporting can go here). Try and resolve the situation with the GM and person (assuming a GM shows up).<br>
c. If none of this is helping, proceed to step 3.<br>
<br>
3. Write out your post in an offline text editor and read it a few times. Sleep on it, then read it a few more times. If you still feel this person merits shitlisting, then copy and paste your post, but be sure that you are right. Reputations are a hard thing to fix, and wrongly accusing someone can hurt yours as well.<br>
<br>
<br>
Ok, that's about it. A very rough draft as I'm throwing it together while at work. Run with it, or I will help you finish it, but I strongly feel we need something up there for people to look at before posting if we are going to complain about improper posting.<br>

I have a better idea.  If someone does something you think deserves to be on here than put them on here. The community can make up their own minds about how bad it is. The problem is there are about 10 people (you know who you are) who have something to say about every post.  The only ones who post should be the people who were involved or others who have had similiar experiences with person listed. I can also see posting if you have something intelligent to say about matter. As for the latter, I dont see too much of that. This must be very tiring for people like Leolan.

Goliathe, I am in no way saying that everyone should read the guidelines first and conform exactly to them, but I think they are a good thing to have available for reference.<br>
Glad you like it though. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Ok, here's an analogy which I hope will help explain how I feel about in-game relations, and relations in general.<br>
<br>
Based on my experiences with apartment renting, I've found that working out noise problems with your neighbor directly and respectfully goes a long way towards mutual respect and resolving the issue (read: sending tells, trying to work it out). Putting your speakers on the ceiling when his stereo is too loud (read: training the person who just trained you, KSing the person who just KS'ed you, /shout, /ooc defaming character), calling the building manager (Guide or GM), police (Verant), or alderman (post on shitlist?) is escalating to a pretty high level, and doing that too early will usually just cause the neighbor to turn his stereo up higher and even try consciously to be a bother to you (read: KS, train, obscene tells, deliberate XP loss to death, etc).<br>
<br>
Well, anyway, that's kinda how I feel about it.<br>

I agree that you should wait until you have cooled off and are able to think clear about the matter. I have one scenario though:<br>
<br>
  Someone (that is Guilded) does something that deserves to S-listed. I talk to their leader and he/she takes care of situation promptly.  Maybe he/she even boots them from guild. Doesn't person still deserve to S-listed? Just because guild took care of him/her doesn't mean people shouldn't be warned.  I think people should leave Guild names out of post until they are confronted with the fact that the guild doesn't want to deal with situation in an appropriate manner.<br>
<br>
Just a thought!  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uleolan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Leolan</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_bluespot.gif BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle><FONT COLOR=AA0000><B>Lanys.com Moderator</B></FONT></span><br> <font color=#000033>(1/23/01 12:30:16 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=384.topic&index=26>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.acinternet.com/leolan/leopic.asp WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: FAQ?</span><hr size=1> It's <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> not</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> a question of blaming the guild.

It's a question of using the list as a <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> LAST RESORT</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> and not surprising people by putting their names up here. <p><p><hr align="left" width="80%" color="#000000">

<br>
&gt;&gt;Leolan Hazzan<br>
<br>
ok - Since I started this, I just want to put in my 2 CP.<br>
<br>
1.  This is the first time I have ever listed anyone<br>
<br>
2.  I had no idea that Dirtt was in a guild, because he was /anon and I have about 7 screenshots of him talking to the Gm with the (logged) text in the background.  You would have to be a master at Photoshop to fake these and I will e-mail them to you if you wish. (try adding or editing text to a transparent background that has a texture to see what I mean)  You could also ask the GM's for a log of the session yourself if you were that conserned with someone &quot;editing&quot; it.<br>
<br>
3.  I don't know alot of &quot;technical&quot; stuff about the game.  I had no idea that /guildstatus existed, or that it would even matter to anyone but myself, my group, the GM's, Dirtt and Jademist that this had happened.<br>
<br>
4.  I am not the only one to have issues with these two, considering that we are only maybe 5 or 10% of the total Lanys players that ever read this list.  Others may have their own issues with these players and not have a single idea of where to vent.<br>
<br>
5.  I did &quot;sleep on it&quot; i.e. the 'Yesterday' in my post; but I do agree with the &quot;sleeping on it&quot; idea wholeheartedly<br>
<br>
6.  Dirtt and I have talked and appologised to each other, Jademist is still KS'ing in HH - and training mobs into us<br>

<br>
You've misattributed some of what I said to Leolan.<br>
Irregardless, I agree that your post was needed here. <br>
I also think that if a FAQ were available and you had it to do over again, you'd have dealt with the guild of at least one person /before/instead of/ shitlisting. <br>
<br>
Also, don't be so sure that Dirtt is not laughing his arse off when he gets tells from Jademist about all the trains he is pulling in HK.<br>

It seems to me that it shouldn't be an either/or choice.  Contacting a guild would be the best step in getting a personal grievance addressed.  The Shit list SHOULD NOT be used for this.  <br>
 However, the shit list does have an important purpose.  It exists as a form a public service.  It is intended as a place to warn other members of the community of people to steer clear of.  If your intentions are truly to warn others of someone you believe may make their gaming life more unpleasant, then this is the place.  It seems to me from the posts in this thread that this post would be warranted under those circumstances, even after guild leaders had been contacted.<br>
