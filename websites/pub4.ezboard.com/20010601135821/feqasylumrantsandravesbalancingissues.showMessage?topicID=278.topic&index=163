<br>
Well.. While I dont speak for the guild, but what you did the other night with CT was EXACTLY like what SA use to do, so I naturally thought it was hardball again. Seems when Ketsui (if it is the old ketsui) came back, so did the old ways. Its to bad. I once has hoped that we could co-exist, but alas I guess Scars isnt as exciting/big/uberfilled as it once was.<br>
<br>
We wont race as we are not fast as you, we wont argue over mobs you are engaging, and we wont discuss raid plans with you before we do them. BUT what we will do, is get Frizz/Verant involved before, during, and after any MOB we are engaged with and you begin massing forces to try to overtake us, try to avoid your guild at all costs as we dont actively seek out the mobs that you are engaged in or are massing for, or seek to discuss MOB plans with you. <br>
<br>
This is hardball? I dont know.. Seems like sort of status quo for SA/Conquest and IF. <br>
<br>
Maybe if we just keep on killing the mobs you are waiting around behind us for, you will go away...<br>

<br>
Conquest is a guild of powergamers, and as such they might have slightly different beliefs about how the game should be played than others, but it seems to me that they have gone out of their way to be helpful, especially since they reformed as conquest.<br>
<br>
They dont HAVE to come help save fear breaks, but they ( and of course many others like IF, 7D etc) do.  <br>
<br>
Contrary to popular belief, they DONT eat babies etc.  Though some of them are extremely opinionated, that doesnt make them evil.<br>
<br>
Some of the previous flames about SA were substatiated, and many were not.  They are not saints (who is..), but they certainly arent devils either.<br>

<br>
Do I agree with all of Conquest's policies?  Nah, prolly not.  But I also see a lot of good that they do, as far as helping people out and such, and they've been quite courteous as of late.<br>
It's a shame that there are people out there who misconstrue a lot of what they do/say and look for every possible angle to attack a lot of these folks based solely on their guild tag.<br>
<br>
And that goes for any guild, really.  Attacking people because of a guild tag isn't right - base your views on actions by that individual person. <p><center><img src = http://members.bellatlantic.net/~mezner/daeonsig2.jpg><br>

I fully agree with you. People were hostile towards Conquest even as they zoned in, without them having killed anything. Comments such as 'they're coming in here just to lag us out, so we can't kill Terror' were heard several times in my group. For me, those comments were a much greater annoyance than Conquest being in the zone. They were there to kill Cazic, whow we weren't even close to being able to kill ourselves. Rest was ours.<br>
<br>
Truth is, even after Terror defeated us (and that wasn't due to lag. Zone can easily support 80 people when they're far enough from each other), they did not kill him, but waited for us to set up and try again. Only after our second failure, and after we had decided not to try a third time, did they kill him. And let our raid have what he dropped (Dawnfire). So, my feeling on this are, that though I would have preferred if we'd had the plane to ourselves, I think Conquest conducted themselves very well in the situation. <p>Ulaian Moonleaf <BR>

I am 1 person and cant speak for everyone, but I personally always thought SA/Conquest got a bad rap.  I've been invited to groups with them, Hell they were a Huge factor if not one of the deciding factors on my epic weapon.   I've been treated very friendly by EVERYONE I ever met from their guild &amp;(previous guild).  For that I treat them just as respectfully.    <br>
<br>
Things that were said in /say as well as in /ooc were not needed to be said period.  I'd like to mention 1 thing though as well.  Kinda late to look at the calandar now, but a couple weeks ago the same thing happened to us on another Fear raid.  Now I am quite sure it was scheduled on the calandar because the host is one who goes out of her way to post such things 2 weeks prior by calandar rules/opinions.  I am 1 who can /shrug it off, heh big deal this is a game to me.  Sure I enjoy it or I wouldnt be playing it but it's a game I'm not gonna let something like this get the best of me.  But alot of people were a little upset that it happened back-to-back like this to our guild on a fear raid.  Obviously it's not intentional on Conquests part, verant just seems to throw a patch up on our Fear raids /shrug.   We have them to blame, NOT Conquest!  <br>
<br>
Both times they've made deals w/ us and gave us time to conduct our raid.  No one is gonna wait forever, a lot of people wish they held off a tad longer before coming in to the zone, but that's out of our control.  Last two raids we've had first time pullers, so alot of time is required to get their pull techniques down.  Monks are a shortage in our guild and as we grow as a guild, and our monks gain xp pulling these planes the raids will go alot more smoother and faster.  Our Hate raids dont take nearly as long as they once did, Fear is next.  <br>
<br>
To wrap this up, Again I personally am apologizing, I cant speak for everyone, I and you (whoever) know this.  I have friends in Conquest and speak to some often or whenever I see them or even out of the blue.  Heh, I was talking to one of them as we were doing our 2nd cr telling him how and why we failed yet again on Terror.  Maybe next time casters and healers will listen to the rogue <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   (no offense, unless you take it offensively /shrug).  I am sorry people had to be subjected to some of the things said and behaviors displayed as well.  We all learned something, lets grow from it and move on.<br>

Once we got underway I got several tells throughout the night from folks in a few of the Uberguilds, Conquest being one of them.  In each instance the people offered assistance with the new &quot;big guys&quot; yet respectfully stayed away until such help was needed [and that was even after I had to log and passed the raid over to Myahak].  We knew CT was way out of our league, that Draco might even be and had no idea if even the Demi's were doable, it being our first encounters with them all, but we were given the chance to try and all the Demi's fell [and no shortage of PC's each time as well but hey it was great fun].  Truth is, if anyone of the guilds involved wanted to come take the stuff, there was nothing we could have done about it, so restraint was practiced and was duly appreciated.<br>
<br>
I don't &quot;know&quot; anyone in any of those guilds and honestly was floored/honored at the respect shown my raid after reading the horror stories here day in and day out.  All I know is, my raid was a blast, and everyone that went, whether at the beginning, or came in towards the end for a couple more tries at Draco, had a blast as well.<br>

Itz (he is the leader still, right?) has been doing a good job keeping relations with other guilds from what it seems.  I've never really had any problems with Conquest as they tend to be more concerned about their image than SA was.  I also know that some people in SA didn't get invited to Conquest for whatever reason.  I assume these were the troublemakers -- OR just the people who were taking a break <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Sorry for that generalization hehe.<br>
<br>
Anyway, people just need to quit bitching about stuff like this... if you are going to whine about it , why don't you create a guild with mostly 56+ (lots of 60s) and start your own raids, and get organized quick, and not die all the damn time. <p><center>Zenambik Fyrenord<BR>54th Season Gnomish Gemchopper <BR>The Chosen Clan</center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ubladecurser.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bladecurser</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></span><br> <b>h0x0r!</b><br> <font color=#000033>(4/1/01 9:18:43 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Learning experience</span><hr size=1> Nice post.<br>
