<br>
I told you before, we don’t deny anything, we don’t fucking care – we wonder why you do. No one cares that we camped all the spawns in an area of Lower Guk, TWO YEARS AGO! As a matter of fact, you're the only one that even remembers. If something spawned – we killed it and I fail to see the issue with that. Are you implying that we denied people the ability to kill everything in all of Lower Guk while we were there? Are you the third stoner on the grassy noll? Was it Cheech & Chong & Chiteng?<br>
<br>
Here’s how a typical Da`Kor exp group worked in Lower Guk. You get 5 people together, plus Azakar, and mow down everything in sight. Lather, rinse and repeat as things respawn. Eventually people work their way into the areas we are camping, at that point one of two things happened. They either asked if they could take spawns X and Y(that we had been killing) at which point we said, “sure”. Or they could just move in on the spawns, in which case we still killed spawn X and Y. Afterwards we laughed at them and openly discussed the loot we just got(we even made shit up so it hurt that much more). See how it worked, all they had to do was ask. We forced etiquette on people, we made Emarr a better place.<br>
<br>
Can I vouch for every Da`Kor member and say they’re on the road to canonization - no. Do I know that there were, and still are, people significantly worse than us on the server – yes! In every one of your posts, you choose to focus on the insignificant details of what people did. You focus on things that had the null set of impact on the server. No one in Da`Kor was ever accused of hacking, scamming, farming shit for eBay or anything else that matters a little more than killing a Specter through a wall when the rest of the server is so low in level they run in fear at the sight of them.<br>
<br>
I really think you need to learn priorities you fucking faggot, and I don’t break out that slander for just anyone. Your shortsightedness is really starting to piss me off and I promise that any more of your posts will be met with outright hostility from me.<br>

Yes I enjoy that freedom Vendrix. You cant touch me. Your implied threats are a joke. You dont even prove anything to your own guild any longer. The people that matter left EQ long ago. You respond out of habit, and never have anything new.<br>

If you dont see the arrogance in your actions then you are merely an object of pity.<br>
If you dont think you should remedy your arrogance well that really just proves my point.<br>

EQ is dying Vendrix. The servers are contracting. It is over. 5 years from now you will have trouble spelling the monsters names. <br>
All you have to look forward to is being killed over and over on DAOC. More power to you. I look forward to the tag 'Vendrix most killed player' <br>

I'm amused at Zolen’s sudden acclamation in the guild hierarchy to “major tank”, does that make his post that much more credible or what? He said he was in the guild 10 months, I’m not so sure that was entirely accurate(but since we don’t punch time cards its not like I can prove it). I know he wasn’t in the guild for the majority of the Nag/Vox slayings and he quit around the time when we killed Trakanon, maybe it was or maybe it wasn’t 10 months – who knows? Giving him the status, “major tank”, just to back yourself up is pretty lame.<br>
<br>
At this point, I thought I would apply a little Chiteng logic in my reply to you. Let’s see how you deal with, well, yourself…<br>
<br>
[reader’s note: time has no meaning in Chiteng posts, everything is the present]<br>
<br>
A major tank that quit DK and joined Avatars of Rage, the guild youre in<br>
said the new DK are gimps and you look up to them, making you lower than gimps and you have nothing to say.<br>
That sounds like an admission<br>
of guilt to me, or should I say gimp. Are you less than gimps?<br>
<br>
I also mention that no on in DK has ever scammed someone, farmed items for eBay or<br>
hacked an account, yet you chose to ignore those points. Do you support those actions against people?<br>
I spoke to you mother’s co-worker’s nephew’s babysitter who said she<br>
knows someone who saw<br>
you put some extra cheese on your burger at the Wendy’s SuperBar without paying<br>
for it, were you always a cheat and a thief and is that why you support hacking, scamming and eBaying? <p><b>Vendrix</b><br>

scammed anyone or sold items on ebay. If that is true then it is surely good,<br>
in fact it is by far the BEST thing I have ever heard about the guild.<br>
If that is true it is to your credit, and you are justly proud.<br>
People who do such things are the absolute worst of players.<br>
I am not sure it has ever been possible to do a 'true' hack of any player file.<br>
<br>
As for me looking 'up' to Zolen, that is amusing. He isnt a Monk.<br>
To me the only true tanks are Monks. (that is opinion btw and not open to debate)<br>
Major Tank to me means any warrior of level 60. Even Kuzic.<br>
<br>
None of which would negate greed and avarice and bullying, and generally throwing<br>
your weight around. (your being used in that sentance as a class descriptor and not specific to Vendrix)<br>

<br>
i seem to remember you used to post stuff about how the acceptance of the negative actions of guildmembers, prior to and during the time said person was in the guild, implicated ALL guildmembers into the area of the wrong.  it was one of the conflicts you fought with yourself over concerning ogmuk.  you considered him above those sorts of actions, but the fact that he allowed people who would do &quot;horrible things&quot; like that meant he must, somehow condone (or simply ignore, which seems just as bad in your eyes) the actions.  do you no longer hold this view of dakor members that you can say the people defending their guild are being overly defensive because they take your attacks on an individual basis versus as a guild?  previously, you've made it clear you hold ever member accountable for the actions of any individula member of the guild.  it's an honest question, i'm wondering if you changed your stance.<br>
<br>
anway, it was said previously, i think, it's early and read through the posts kind of quickly...but, zolen has nothing but respect for early dakor.  the people who were the core of your malice against dakor..maybe malice isn't the right word, but you get the point...are in fact some of the people he holds in highest regard.  half of his list of &quot;the best of the best&quot; (in his opinion) were old dakor members.  one being a founder.<br>
<br>
i left dakor, i've got no reason to defend them, i didn't even know most of them by the time they decided to retire the guild name from eq (boy, what a fuss that made).  i'm posting because i think zolen is actually being misrepresented by you.  i suppose you can use what zolen said to further a negative image of dakor in recent (prior to retirement) days, but not dakor in general and all encompassing.<br>
<br>
i can answer a few questions though.  were the members of dakor elitist assholes, most certainly, they've never tried to hide that.  did they push their weight around, yup, i benefited from having that tag as much as i ever lost.  (note the balance, there was A LOT of negatives to carrying that guildtag, some created through the guilds own actions, come mythical, created by some angry crazy person).  did they think only of themsevles and how something would benefit them and their own, depending ont he day of the week..yes.  and probably yes to just about every questions you can ask.  i WAS there, i DID witness it, from the guild stand point, behind the lines, so to speak.<br>
<br>
the flip side, of course, being that the members did care about each other and did go out of their way to help others- individually and as a guild.  sometimes they would use their &quot;power&quot; (weight) to help others accomplish something otherwise lost to that person/guild.  even though they thought mostly of themselves, they were generally the first (sometimes the only) to ease a tense situation by (OMG, am i about to say it?) backing down and moving on to something else.<br>
<br>
i can only speak for the guild concerning the time i was in it, it is my understanding it was very different after i left, but i can only assume that the answers still apply.  i say that on the basis that almost any guild you asked your questions of would have the same answers.  that's why they are a guild at all, afterall.  to achieve their ultimate goals...this often entails a somewhat elitest asshole attitude (usually grudgingly, but it is almost forced on high end guilds, the game pushes it)...a certain amount of only thinking about oneself and guild...and looking to do things that will only benefit them (sometimes at the cost of others, sometimes not).<br>
<br>
there was a time when ONLY dakor was like that.  with the rise of so many others, it has become clear to me that their attitude from back then was partially their own, and partially created by the environment the game put them in.  i say this on loose grounds, with consideration to the evolution of every other guild who has risen to power and glory comparable to that of the dakor of then.  they have all had the exact same criticisms placed on them from various sources as you often chastise dakor for.  <br>
<br>
i think it's a fight you will most likely have to broaden your field of attack for if you plan on stamping out the contagion.  dakor is in company with many guilds now (funny, they don't even exist on emarr anymore as a guild...)  members of old school dakor, new dakor, magister, MS, SF, affliction, UI, even of my own guild before i quit, umoja...all the other powerhouse guilds that currently exist (excuse me for not listing you all, it's quite a long list these days i hear), they all had/have members who exploited at one point or another and inadvertantly (or intentionally) helped their guild (new and old members alike) get where they are today and continue to succeed.  they all had/have elitist attitude, are bossy, pushy...<br>
<br>
chiteng, they are all like that now.  they didn't follow in dakor's footsteps, as you might say.  they all fought dakor tooth and nail early on...then they got there, saw what it was like, felt the same pressures, dealt with the same crap, became callused, and now here we are.  a multitude of guilds with the same pros and cons of dakor, the natural evolution of a power guild.  <br>
<br>
note:  i don't think all the guilds are bad, they do wonderful things for each other and themselves, there are pros to the guilds, just pointing out that the cons are the very same as the old war on dakor cons that chiteng wages.  <br>
<br>
i'm not trying to call you a hypocrite, so don't read it that way, i'm saying your war is much bigger than dakor, and if you are going to fight it, truly, in the manner you speak so forcefully of, you need to attack the problem as a whole.  even if dakor walked up and admitted everything to you today, here, the next post after mine, it wouldn't matter, the next guild would still need to be dealt with...and they would fight you just as fiercely as dakor ever did.  so if you are gonna attack the part, best get the rest of it in there too.  <br>
<br>
note again:  i am, in no way whatsoever kissing ass to dakor.  the circumstances around my leaving left a horrid taste in my mouth for some of their (ok, most of their) members of the time.  i see them posting here against you, understand that this is just my view, has no affiliation whatsoever with their protestations and attacks.  i don't think any of them are horrible people, i don't think you are either, but i think they have been attacked long enough for &quot;sins&quot; they are not alone in committing.  <br>
<br>
zolen was (is) a good guy.  he was highly biased and is very arrogant.  his words are hardly conclusive and are in no way an accurate description of all that dakor was.  not to mention we cannot miss the actual point of his post...dakor may have been bad, but a certain other guild was far worse.  (no, i don't know the validity of that statement, i assume you do and have your own opinion regarding it).  <br>
<br>
not to mention this nasty little bit of truth.  if you consider his opinion of dakor to be valid enough to pin dakor down with it, that says horrid things about AoR...because it means he is just as right about them.  <br>
<br>
anyway, i've rambled long enough, i shouldn't even be awake, it's too damn early.<br>

It is in fact game wide.<br>
That is why I had the 6 founding members of the first elite guild on Tribunal banned. All 6 for Ebaying. It didnt matter they just moved to the next new server.<br>
I dont even know which server it is. But on Tribunal virtually ALL the beginning guilds were founded by people wanting to make money on Ebay. One example:<br>
one jackass cleric named Zevokaii made a habit of camping 20/7 Frenzied.<br>
He would NOT share the camp and he would NOT allow you in his group unless<br>
you kissed his ass. He would hand out FBSS as favors to people he liked. Naturaly<br>
these people would tend to defend him when uncouth people like myself confronted<br>
him. One day my guild finally decided I was right and we went down and basicly<br>
told him and his guild we were staying until I got a FBSS. Fortunately I had already<br>
notified an invis guide who was there to watch. That player no longer exists on Tribunal. By the way this activity went on for THREE months in real time.<br>
He was the absolute worst kind of player.<br>
<br>
Emarr for all it faults, is not that jaded. None of the peope I knew at the beginning<br>
played for money, at least that I knew of.<br>
<br>
Why do I harp on DK and not MS? Because MS doesnt swagger around claiming<br>
they are the BEST players on EQ. Besides I know Toadhammer personally.<br>
You see it matters to me if the guild has a monk in it that I can respect.<br>
I can ask that person about certain events and get their side. If UI did something<br>
wrong I would just send Mitch a tell and ask her what really happened.<br>
But that isnt possible with a guild that refuses to admit its errors.<br>
You see, it is that swagger that offends me. If you are TRUELY the best Ogmuk,<br>
you dont need to group with suspect players. You can be ABOVE that.<br>
If you are TRUELY elite, you are not constrained by the same limits that others face. If you are TRUELY elite, you dont need to deny events to protect your<br>
reputation. There should be no events to protect from. Finally an Elite units monitors<br>
itself and its members. If one person of the units gets out of hand, you never hear about it because the other members DEAL with him. But that isnt what DaKor is<br>
about. To DaKor (by reading Kerrol and Tuan) 'Elite == merely means 'proficient'.<br>
If you can play your class well and are a solid guildmate then that is all they care<br>
about. That ISNT elite. That is merely efficient, as I have said before. The book<br>
'Goodfellows' shows you can be crimminal and still be efficient. As for the Old<br>
DaKor, I have the greatest respect for Oggie. Not so much for Naru since he refused to play or pull unbuffed to the max.(does that mean the raid is cancelled<br>
if certain buffers are not available?) As I said I never had a pet shaman permanently grouped with me. Kizmet possibly if he bothered to use his conscience.<br>
Rannd and Beba. Except even then they would toss away Parnell for example,<br>
who was a close companion of Rannd until he turned to the dark side.<br>
Other people that became members at the same time or consistently grouped<br>
with DaKor...I wont comment. I have voiced my opinion loudly on many occasions<br>
about some of them. Except one. Frosty I am sorry. If you are still out there<br>
I regret some things.<br>
<br>
<br>
But there is also a personal issue with Tzzird that drives me. He swore he would<br>
make sure I was blacklisted from ever going on any raids with DK and its allies.<br>
Well he won that one. But unlike Justicia I wont shut up.<br>
<br>
Tell me DaKor how do you justify stealing a rare drop from the person who won the roll? And hand it to someone else?<br>
<br>
You see I dont make these litte incidents up, people come and tell me.<br>
Little by little a picture builds of what is really going on. It is a repulsive spectecle.<br>
<br>
**************************************************************<br>
i can answer a few questions though. were the members of dakor elitist assholes, most certainly, they've never tried to hide that. did they push their weight around, yup, i benefited from having that tag as much as i ever lost. (note the balance, there was A LOT <br>
**************************************************************<br>
<br>
Heh well they have denied it consistently on this board since day one. You just try to get Kuzic to admit it. You see that would be a victory for Chiteng. That isnt allowed. We would rather be liars than allow that. What I dont understand is WHY<br>
anyone would want to join a guild run by (see the above quote)<br>
<br>
As for who and where I fight. Usually the fight is thrust in my face. Vendrix is a good example. I would not bring him up any longer because Mitch asked me to lay off. But he just HAS to keep chiming in. What is so sad about it is all his posts<br>
are PERSONAL he cant seem to grasp the knack of impersonal posts.<br>
<br>
But I must admit that most of my jabs at DK are jabs at what you call the OLD DK.<br>
<br>
Zolen is quite likely right about the new DK in whatever form.<br>

1. His mission in life is to bring down ‘the man’ which, in EQ, seems to be anyone he doesn’t seen eye to eye with, unless…<br>
2. If you have a Monk in your guild he’ll leave you alone.<br>
3. Da`Kor = Goodfellas, I actually like this one.<br>
4. He’s still pissed that Naru wouldn’t pull without some buffs, 2 years after the fact.<br>
5. He thinks only Tzzird put him on the eternal blackball list when, in fact, there are many more people who support that decision. He’s sure making a good effort to prove us wrong.<br>
6. He still thinks, in spite of every other post I write containing a very explicit line to the contrary, that we deny everything. Hablo Inglés?<br>
<br>
<font color=fff00>None of the peope I knew at the beginning played for money, at least that I knew of.</font><br>
<br>
Why stop assuming, its done well for you up until now? Every one of your other half-assed theories was voiced as factual information. Every comment by someone you use to support your fight, no matter who said it or when, you view as scripture. Start thinking we eBayed every single piece of loot we ever denied you or anyone else on Emarr, add fuel to that fire!<br>
<br>
<font color=fff00>Besides I know Toadhammer personally.<br>
You see it matters to me if the guild has a monk in it that I can respect.</font><br>
<br>
Just take a moment to reflect on this little tidbit from your post, if you will. I hope, now that you're looking at it in a nice yellow font, you realize how much of an idiot, or should I say hypocrite, you really are. In the simplest of translations possible you just said, “I don’t care what a guild does if they have a monk I like.” Here I was, covering the arch of my door with lamb’s blood and all it takes is having a Monk who is liked by you. The neighbors will be pleased to hear that one, there was a dreadful odor in the hallway.<br>
<br>
By the way, there are numerous issues with Mitch and loot-whoring on this board within the past 2-3 months. Those 150+ posts by non-Da`Kor people could be lying though, you should probably assume they are…<br>
<br>
<font color=fff00>You see I dont make these litte incidents up, people come and tell me.</font><br>
<br>
Good to see you actually apply some perspective to all this bullshit you stir up, “little incidents” is correct but you treat them all like bomb threats at the Vatican. Also nice to see you're the shoulder of Emarr, to be cried upon if anyone from can think of something we did wrong to them – 2 years ago.<br>
<br>
Chiteng, doesn’t it bother you that no one ever takes your side on these boards – ever? Well, except when you login that other account, post in support of yourself and claim its your wife… we love that. 99.9% of the people who read the Emarr boards are laughing at you, the other .1% are all of your other personalities who are, quite possibly, also laughing at you. <p><b>Vendrix</b><br>

<br>
if you can find one negative thing about beba, i'll give you a medal, seriously.  i suppose you can fault him for his loyalty to his family, i mean, that is the ONLY reason he left dakor.  beba definitely wasn't the best puller i'd ever met, but damn, i sure could never find another monk who could pull hate like he could.  so that's definitely to his credit.  <br>
<br>
yeah, i know, i'm biased, but one thing is for sure when it comes to beba and rand, i'll definitely tell it like it is.  being in the same room with that family when they played, oh man, the fights, the yelling, woah, you have no idea.  haha.  i can give you a million negative real life things about beba, but in game, there was no nicer, more mellow, calm individual you could ever meet.<br>
<br>
rand and parnell...yup, rand dropped parn pretty hard with the whole HoD thing.  of course, parnell was (by his own admission, not that those of us there didn't know) the worst example of a guildmate you could find.  my ... err...dislike...yeah...of parnell stemmed from early experiences from HoD.  his most loveable characteristic of then?  damn, that boy was ALL about what he could get for himself (yup, parnell was greedy! oh the humanity!)  see, in UO, parnell was the ultimate packrat (trust me, i made the mistake of going to help organize his house, OMG!), he kept EVERYTHING, think he had two kitchen sinks.  anyway, he still carried that mentality into everquest, where it really has no place.  if you want EVERYTHING in everquest, you become a greedy, lootwhore, hoarding, pain in the ass.  rand didn't want to put up with listening to it anymore and did what any respectable friend would do, dropped him on his ass and let him figure it out for his damn self.  which parnell did.<br>
<br>
most of the distance that was placed between parnell and rand (and co.) was because i couldn't stand him.  he grated on my nerves SO bad.  and trust me, parn had no love for me either.  ultimately, we called a truce, because rand and parnell ARE good friends, they have their issues from time to time, as all friends do, but to this day, yup, friends they are.  so, for the sake of the people we mutually loved and cared for, parnell and i put aside our differences (this was NOT easy for me, trust me, he annoyed the HELL out of me), kept a neutral stance toward each other, and eventually vented enough of our frustrations about each other to each other that we got over it.  parn is my friend now, do i still hate things about him, oh hell yes, but i love him to death and would fight fiercely for him now.  <br>
<br>
so back off some of the stuff you THINK you know about the history of rand and parnell, there is so very much you don't know.<br>
<br>
and then, from that, take a hint.  there is ALWAYS so very much you don't know if you weren't there first hand.  i know you do know what you are talking about concerning somethings.  spectre cave exploiting people, questionable item looting procedures.  that stuff is true, but again, that's been admitted, even if you seem to have missed where it happened.  <br>

Tell me Vendrix, who set up the board again? Who is the primary readership<br>
aimed at? Who is the board administrator? Hmmm seems to me that there is a pattern.<br>
<br>
But to answer your question every now and then there is a person that will<br>
post on your board and does encourage me. You just choose to not recall them.<br>
That and the fact that people I never heard of before will tell me in game<br>
that they agree with me and enjoy my posts. Yes I assume you will choose to not believe that, and that is fine by me. Because that is YOUR delusion Varixx.<br>
<br>
As for me liking monks - wow what a surprise. You ignored the other part of that.<br>
The ability to talk to them to verify what actually happens. That doesnt exist<br>
with DaKor, since it never makes any mistakes. They never chase people out of a zone the never hog camps for weeks on end. Never steal loot from someone they dont like and hand it to someone they do like. BTW did you read Kanyas post?<br>
<br>
As for your eternal blacklist - Vendrix your really something. If OGMUK asked me to join I would refuse. He is the only member I respect without hesitation.<br>
You would have to toss three people out that your fond of. Why is it that I dont think you would do that? So you see Vendrix you little list means nothing.<br>
All you need do is keep them in your guild. Thats fine with me. You deserve them.<br>
<br>
As for Mitch - you absolute jackass, she has been faithfully trying to supress<br>
this little banter for YEARS. I assumed you and she were at a minimum associates<br>
if not freinds. She has taken your side on issues more often than I care to remember. And you publicly burn her. You creep.<br>

So I get little surprises along the way. As for Beba I cant tell when she is playing or when he is playing. It was confusing to say the least. But 'they' certainly were not cowards.<br>
<br>
But after being gone for 3 months(raising hell on Tribunal as you may have gathered) I spoke to Parnell who happened to be in zone. You must understand that whenever I saw Rannd he was with Parnell. It was a BIG shock to see<br>
Parnell twisting in the wind. It was a similar shock to read Rannds unsigned posts<br>
flamming me. But if rumour has it correctly - he eventually saw a side of DaKor<br>
