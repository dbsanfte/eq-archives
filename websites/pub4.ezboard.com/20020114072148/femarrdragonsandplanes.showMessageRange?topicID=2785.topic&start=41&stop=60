<br>
I know you weren't being nasty when you said this, but thought I'd clear something up<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> while Cao has the option for a ND, i don't.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I leveled past 52 way post velious, prior to the ND even being an option.  Now, I have my ND, and I'm glad to have it, but I didn't know it would be an option when I decided to forgo Naggy/Vox.<br>
<br>
As for the rest of it, well, I have to agree with Celdor that the bard epic is, without question, a phenomenal piece for a bard. I have never questioned that bards should have sole rights to the white scale, I don't even think int casters should get a shot seeing as there are many cloaks that match or rival the WDSC.<br>
<br>
Beyond that, the one thing that bothers me, and the main reason I do not attend pickup raids with any of my characters is that they are no longer pick up raids.<br>
<br>
Jex readily admits that she skews the randoms in favor of her friends that attend the raids.  That's her right, and I'm not going to question it, but that negates the pickup raid aspect.  You are assigning a higher importance to a raid attendant because you know them or because they have been with you longer, or what not.<br>
<br>
That's not pickup raid rules, those are guild rules.  I expect my guild members and myself to know who would benefit more from an item and make decisions accordingly.  Pickup raids are different tho, you are asking people to attend and support you, to donate for costs, and yet offering no reward unless you have some prior knowledge of them.  <br>
<br>
I ask again, if the 45-49's are not necessary, not needed and merely &quot;cannon fodder&quot;, why even let them attend?  I propose it's because you simply wouldn't have the numbers otherwise.  So you are asking for raid attendants so &quot;person a&quot; can get a benefit.  You may be getting no personal &quot;loot&quot; benefit yourself, but you are assisting your friends, and that's equal in my eyes.<br>
<br>
I've said it before, I don't care what the raid rules are, if you attend, you agree to them, but you're not being honest with yourself, in my opinion. You're setting yourself up as this altruistic character who solely exists for the benefit of the masses who can't otherwise attend dragon raids.....but you're getting something.<br>
<br>
And Theo, I respect you and I respect your opinions, but I have to disagree with you on the earning your stripes aspect.  These are not guild raids.  You earn your stripes in guild raids, you expect to put forth effort for your guild members, with no prospect of reward to yourself, the exception being that you know your guild members will be there to back you up at a later date, when you are needing it.<br>
<br>
These are pickup raids, therefore your sole responsibility is to show up, follow directions and do your part.  You have NO responsibility beyond that.  In my opinion, and obviously there are many who disagree with me, but all are equal on a pickup raid.  <br>
<br>
If that was not the case, it'd be so easy to zone into any area, say, hey, I been camping this &quot;x&quot; for 8 weeks now, and you only just showed up, so I get to roll and you don't.  How well would that go over?  It wouldn't.  <br>

<br>
You already knew I respect your opinions.  If you didn't, I'm happy to tell you I do.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I think I understand the point you're making.  So I feel I need to throw out a hypothetical question.<br>
<br>
I think you and several others will remember that once (and only once, lol) I called a dragon haste item on a raid.  I knew it was somewhat maverick of me, and I got a lot of grief for it.  I almost didn't make the numbers, and the muster took a lot longer.<br>
<br>
And in that case, I have to certainly agree with you.  It wasn't really a &quot;pick-up&quot; spirit raid per se.  And of course I learned that day (the hard way I might add), this view which I now espouse regarding the approval of the majority on a pick-up raid.  I very nearly didn't have it.<br>
<br>
I think I need to mention that by &quot;approval&quot; in this case I mean loot rules.  Obviously the burden of strategy and yelling instructions was still on me.  It's the risk we take when we lead raids.  By this I mean that the goal in a pick-up raid is signed off by the majority, although the strategic implementation rests with the leader.<br>
<br>
And if I follow you correctly, I must also agree that a pick-up &quot;clique&quot; that calls items for people doesn't necessarily confrom to the &quot;true spirit&quot; of a pick-up raid.<br>
<br>
So with all that preamble aside, I'd like to focus again on the policy of level cap on epic loot.<br>
<br>
I think that the level cap on epic loot isn't as discriminatory as to make it a &quot;guild-raid&quot; by nature.  For all one knows, that level 51 paladin who won a book may have never been to your raids before.  Therefore, does it not still conform to the spirit of &quot;pick-up&quot; in that case?<br>
<br>
The level cap on epic loot does not require that the person has been to every one of your raids since day one.  It implies that that person is part of the server community at large, not just your regular raidgroup.  And that they are trying for an epic drop which they need (need being a relative term, your mileage may vary).  Now, luck may not be with them, they may lose the roll, and thereafter attend all your raids (assuming you are always running the raid), but come to that point is the raidleader still responsible for their not getting a shot at the roll?  I don't think so, myself.  They rolled, they lost, they have to go again or give up.<br>
<br>
We've all seen a book called.  Usually with reluctance, and either by a person who has consistently attended and lost the roll.  Other times by a raid leader who is a friend of the unfortunate party.<br>
<br>
People call scales too, for the same reasons often enough.<br>
<br>
So in the purest sense of the term, I have to agree.  That's not really &quot;pure pick-up&quot; per se.<br>
<br>
But level capping the epic loot isn't the same matter, I don't think.  The level cap rule doesn't necessarily default the item to a specific person.  It gives the shot at those with the least time left to get it without slamming their head on the glass ceiling.<br>
<br>
I understand, we're discussing semantics here.  Nonetheless I find it interesting and would like to know other opinions.<br>
<br>
I think we're agreed that if you attend, you submit to the rules in place.  If you don't like them, don't go.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Oh, and the &quot;doing time&quot; term is something that I see people submit themselves to.  It's not a requirement, as we know.  Anyone can muster a raid, call their item, win it, and move on.  I must say though, I see quite a few people subscribe to the philosophy and practice it.  Far more than I see people mustering their own raids and surgically going for their items and washing their hands of the old world dragons.<br>
<br>

Theo<br>

Good stuff.  Nothing better then a good rant/flame session.<br>
<br>
As far as rolling the book to level 52 only (or whatever the level limit was), that's totally the way to go.  They put the effort into making 52, they're going to do more damage, have less chance of dying and generally speaking, will have most likley been to more raids then someone lower.<br>

Good call on the raid rules, don't listen to this shit or anyone that tells you otherwise.<br>

<br>
Something you don't realize about the pickup raid environment is that, even with those simple responsibilities, people often don't live up to them. Some  examples:<br>
<br>
- Kerna, given the time he has been doing dragon pickups and respect level he has generated, generally can get enough people of the necessary classes to sign up pre event to make up planned lists, but a number of those people become no shows and he has to scramble for sufficient people of particular classes. <br>
<br>
-Of those who show up for a raid, the raiders will often have NO resist gear or extremely limited gear(despite what the leader has requested), and not let the raid leader know about it.<br>
<br>
-On a couple of pickup raids I've been on, there have been healers who refuse to heal rangers during a fight(being a ranger I did tend to notice). They don't tell the raid leader, they dont tell the group leader, and always say that &quot;rangers die too fast&quot;. <br>
<br>
-I also have seen classes that are supposed to be doing the healing for a group not doing so. I imagine that they were holding off so they have lots of mana for nuking, but since I would often end up dead before the nuke point, I couldn't tell for myself.<br>
<br>
- Despite the raid leader shouting for people to stay in one area, you always have those people, especially people who are there for the first time, wandering around to check things out. They aggro things from all over, running back to the group, generally over the medding casters.<br>
<br>
To be honest, I can't see why anyone would lead more than one pickup raid, but I am very happy that they do. I'm one of those people in the &quot;no/social/family&quot; guild void that would have NO chance to do something like take on a dragon. <br>
<br>
My thanks to all of the pickup raid leaders(especially Kerna and Jex since they are the ones that have put up with me the most. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ).

<br>
fair flower of felwithe, i would like to respectfully disagree with you.  to call the vox/naggy raids as &quot;pick up&quot; raids is an oversimplification.  some people use that term to describe any raid that is not a guild raid.  as an example, sage/torm's raids are still described as pick up raids but are better run than some guild raids i've been on.  <br>
<br>
having never been on one, you are missing one point.  as was voiced by theo, the naggy/vox &quot;community&quot; to a large degree has developed certain practices and viewpoints.  you will find this in any group.  one of the views (although not shared by all, especially the greedy or the new) for palys is that it's &quot;right&quot; to put in your time.  PERSONALLY (and i have heard several other paladins say the same thing) they dont mind &quot;paying your dues 46 - 49&quot;.  as mentioned, it's almost viewed as a right of passage.  <br>
<br>
i hope this doesnt sound as if i'm saying you have no room to speak since you havent done a naggy/vox raid.  i'm only saying that if you had gone on some of the raids you may have received the same impression i had (if the attitude/ views of your contemporaries were the same). <br>
<br>
no, no one ever sat down and wrote this down.  this is not a consipiracy.  it is what has evolved and how we as paladins have justified in our minds the tedious wait for a paly book.  i'm not even bringing the &quot;waiting at 52lvl&quot; aspect of it into this.  and my statements above are not blanket statements for all pallys, not even for all pallys that attend the raids.  it's just my impression of how i and some of the paladins whom i've raided with feel, or been conditioned to view the situation.<br>
<br>
personally, i dont have a problem with a 52 paly who has gone to a lot of raids getting the book over me by default.  you are right, those 46 to 49 are often the difference in defeating naggy/vox.  but again, for some of us, it's a part of the framework by which we view our rp aspect of what a paladin is.  service to the greater good.  i know that sounds corny and insincere on my part, but it is how i view it.  <br>
<br>
and no, i dont think jex's actions are designed to appear altruistic while secretly serving her friends.  as was commented by theo (i think) her rules favor ALL 52 paladins not just the ones she knows.  obviously, if she gets a lot of palys signing up she can pick her friends and thus she would be rewarding them, but again, if a paly has put in the time and effort into supporting raids, then they should be rewarded.  yes, i can see where it might appear unfair, but i think the paly book going to the highest level paly in the raid is comparable to NBG.  some people claim NBG is not fair since certain classes who risked may not be rewarded.  <br>
<br>
not to sound holier than anyone, but in response to some who argue about an epic that isnt even that good, yes, it's not &quot;worth the effort&quot;.  but i think some of us palys want it for the same reason we picked to play a paladin.  god knows it wasnt to play an uber class <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I would then run the raid for them, with all droppable loot going to all.<br>
<br>
Giving the white scale to a 50-52 bard is pretty dumb, since it will just be sitting in the bank for months until they finally get in a guild that is able to take out Trak.  <br>
<br>
The situation with pallies isn't as bad, since a group of low fifties is able to finish that quest, but I would still give preference to a level 60 over any level 50-52.<br>
<br>
Red scales are easy to get (they drop from multiple mobs), but once again, they should only go to people that actually have a chance to finish the epic in the near future.  I would random them to all, unless there was a warrior/bard there that already had their green/white scale.<br>
<br>
The current Vox/Naggy leaders are generally in it for themselves or their friends.  They hurt the Bard community by giving white scales to people that have little or no chance of completing the bard epic.  They interfere with with Cleric community by waiting until convenient to kill Naggy, which delays the Ragefire spawn.<br>
<br>
When are people these people going to realize that Vox/Naggy are newbie mobs that Verant (in their infinite wisdom) placed as obstacles in a few classes epics.  One high level group could very possibly take them out, but two would do it with ease.  <br>

45-49's do NOT attend my raids. If they do, they are entitled to all loot except epic loot. If they agree to that, they come and have fun. If they do not wish to come, that is their right and they will be replaced . Most of the time they get mad because I turn them down in favor of the 50+ raiders.<br>
<br>
As to you &quot;guild&quot; raiding mentality, it's not a guild. It's an widely accepted policy, just as higher level's rotation on VS and Trak, Magister and MF's roto on ring wars/N-ToV. It seems that the only people who have a problem with the way it is currently done are:<br>
<br>
A) People who do not believe in paying their dues.<br>
<br>
B) Loot Crazed/Immediate Gratification Obsessed Assholes.<br>

<br>
Yes, the way I put it made it seem like I was trying to be exclusive to &quot;my friends&quot; but I'll tell you that is not true, even though it is.  Explanation being this... any one who shows up to my raid is generally in... unless their level is low or they show up to late and there just is no room.  I took 8 groups to Naggy... why?  Because the people showed up and I didnt want to have to turn anyone away... why?  Because everyone deserves a shot at the fun or the loot.  Most of my raids only have about a dozen &quot;regulars&quot; the rest being random players who decide to give it a shot.  All those people are as important to me as the ones that I know from past experiences... otherwise I would be defaulting the items or turning people away.  I LOVE meeting new people and getting to know them... I also love knowing that perhaps I'll see them again.<br>
<br>
Another thing I have been doing recently on my raids (some people like the idea, some people dont) is that I allow people who are too high to fight the dragon to come along and help out in exchange for their shot at the items suitable for their class.  EXAMPLE:  Xentar (60 cleric) has attended a number of my raids and has helped with buffline/res's... in exchange for doing so he gets to roll on all items that the clerics get to roll on.  I have offered higher level bards (53+) an opportunity to come along, help with clearing giants, and sing the mana song for the buffline in exchange for a chance at the scale.  Same goes for paladins who can buff, or whomever else we can benefit from (regardless of if they are my friends or not)<br>
<br>
I have also told people/friends or guilds that if they knew someone who needed an item (specifically an epic piece) from Vox I would be more than happy to lead for them and allow them to set the loot rules.  As long as they set the rules and everyone is clear that it is &quot;their raid their rules&quot; and Im just the one in charge of the routine.<br>
<br>
As far as the &quot;friend favoring&quot;... anyone in the game who hasnt wronged me in some way is &quot;my friend&quot; and I believe that giving my all to help others is rewarding enough to know that its worth it despite the hassles that may come out of it.<br>
<br>
If someone has only raided with me once and they show great attitude, great team work, and they work hard to support the raid then they will rank right up there with the others who have been there from the beginning.  The people with the good attitudes are the ones I root for as far as loot... regardless of how long I have known them or how well.<br>
<br>
I meet new people each time I lead a dragon raid... and when those people come back I know Im doing something right.<br>
<br>
And thats all that matters to me.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ujexielia.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Jexielia</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_magentaspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 577<br> <font color=#E9D756>(12/17/01 11:09:13 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I have a bitch about loot rules</span><hr size=1> bah wrong account<br>

Most people kill dragons as they level and hope for some good stuff and then when they overshoot the level cap, they move on.  With the implimentation of certain levels getting rights to certain items, a person who really wants to spend the time to get the item can show his dedication by not leveling.  Personally I wish that every item was reserved for level 52 because there would almost never be a failed raid unless they were all total idiots but somehow I don't think that will draw much support. <p>"Of the many truths choose one, follow it blindly, for it shall become a falsehood and you a fanatic."     -Blyte</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uceldor.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Celdor</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 1485<br> <font color=#E9D756>(12/17/01 11:22:02 am)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> <BR><img src=http://home.austin.rr.com/mav1973/cel1.jpg w=110 h=145></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I have a bitch about loot rules</span><hr size=1> That logic could be applied to any class or item, Trech. Technically no one 'needs' anything to log in and play. Will having certain things make you feel more capable as a class? Yes. Do you need them if you are doing end game level mobs? In the case of the bard epic, yes. <br>
<br>
So let me rephrase my comment. The bard epic is necessary for those bards that are doing high-level or end-game mobs. You are, at best, running at 75% of what you could be offering as a class without it. I think we could agree on that, or at least I hope we could.<br>
<br>
Jex, they are your loot rules. If people don't like them they can lead their own raid. Nire had similiar issues back in the day and all pickup leaders do. It is that discord which eventually drives them from leading pickup raids.

<br>
The Xentar Im referring to (he) came along the first few times for nothing... just to be nice... just to help... after that I (me me me me me) chose to random him in on the rolls... as a way of thanking him for his time and showing him that we were grateful for all that he had done for us.  So there was no sucking up or lowering ones self... the Xentar I speak of never came with the intentions of trying to get an item or any rewards.  I (me me me me) just felt that after the hours of support and kindness he deserved a little something in return (and so far he sure in hell hasnt gotten much)<br>
<br>
This is also posted along with my loot rules... and despite the fact that YOU dont like it... the people who show up sure in hell dont seem to mind.<br>
<br>
When you have someone offering lvl 56 res's to all that die its atleast worthy of a shot at something... atleast thats how I feel.<br>
<br>
Im sure not going to have 4-5 people come along for a shot at the loot who's not "of level" but 2 maybe...  Depends on what they have to offer. <p><img src="http://jexielia.20megsfree.com/images/sig22.jpg"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ujexielia.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Jexielia</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_magentaspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 579<br> <font color=#E9D756>(12/17/01 11:38:55 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A question</span><hr size=1> Btw... thanks Cel =)<br>

It gets on my nerves when really low people get to go on high level raids just because when I was that level, I was never able to do so because I was too low. Or, the fact that I wasn't uber enough at my lower level just because I didn't spend all my days in EC buying things cheap and selling them rediculously high in order to buy my blue diamond bracelets, etc.<br>
<br>
I believe 50+ is a VERY good loot rule. I didn't complain when I was lower than this because I knew that is how the loot went.<br>
<br>
Through the entire naggy raid and vox raid (until I was forced to leave because of RL) the other mage (lvl 46) kept nagging me about to mage items dropping and how if they did he should be able to get them. And also, he complained that the cleric got the all/all item that he could have used. <br>

I agree. The haste alone on the sword would more than make up for the lack of double attack. I think in high end encounters the bard needs to be primarily in a melee role and the epic does enable that. I was just trying point out through all the bitching that the weapon is not necessary to play the game and fun can be had without it <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uzoldarf.showPublicProfile?language=EN>zoldarf</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 7<br> <font color=#E9D756>(12/17/01 12:52:09 pm)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A question</span><hr size=1> Obviously, if you don't like the rules, don't show up.  On the other hand, some of the rules are probably scaring off a lot of quality raiders.  It's one thing to allow a high level cleric to random on an item in return for doing lvl 56 rezzes.  That's a valuable service, to say the least.  But allowing high level bards to /random in return for &quot;clearing giants&quot; and &quot;Playing the Mana Song&quot; seems a bit of a stretch.  That's just not an important enough service... it MAYBE saves a bit of time, depending on buff-line coordination.<br>
<br>
A couple of the people in my KC group and I received tells over the course of several hours asking if we wanted to go on the Vox raid... we laughed about it, saying the raid was probably having trouble finding people because of the rules.  Anyway, I think the reasonableness of the loot rules has a lot to do with who is willing to show up.  Is having a bard play the mana song worth not having several 50+ people show up?  Probably not...<br>
<br>
I for one don't mind attending raids where the epic loot is defaulted or restricted.  If some paladin has gone to 10 naggy raids and not gotten a book, maybe they deserve to get one the next raid.  But if I'm attending a raid, I think it's fair for me to expect anyone who'll be getting loot to have put in some sort of substantial effort toward killing the beast.  This excludes people who are there to kill giants or people who's levels are so low they get evaporated within 5 seconds of the fight starting.<br>
<br>
Just my thoughts.<br>
