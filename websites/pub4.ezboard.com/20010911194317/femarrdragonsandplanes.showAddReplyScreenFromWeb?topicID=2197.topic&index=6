Think about that.  To me, friendship is the greatest phat lewt of all.  And I'll be damned if I let a bunch of equipment pixels get in the way of that.<br>
<br>
And if friendship is not your thing, and your greedy, consider that you need an uberguild to do the big stuff.  Last time I checked, most or all uberguilds frown on those who are selfish and greedy.  Therefore, you would serve yourself to appear as one who serves.<br>

I read your post and I have to agree with that. But I have also got to tell you I'm not in that section of gaming. I support NBG in groups. I vote for it and if there is disagreement that splits the group I leave with NBG people. I haven't ever abused it and actually my current trading style invalidates me on most NBG too (I don't want to claim NBG on item that I might sell to get plats for trading when someone offers above its price). But then again I will put my nose on every random all, when there is no valid NBG argument (hell yeah I random against all people, who ask if they can get it to their twink/friend outside the group).<br>
<br>
The rogue has always been my main and I'm sort of proud of it. I have never felt useless because I didn't have DB Sash, Traka Tooth and Locustlure to start with. Yet I have spent some time getting upgrades to my gear at EC... not that much... got myself Slime Coated Harpoon at level 27 and was happy ever after until I got traded myself Traka Tooth at around 47-48 or so.<br>
<br>
One reason for me never seeing those people again actually was that at least for me not playing in peak times, I found out myself as only rogue in zone and among the last ones to get the group. Why? Because the times I made my leveling from 1-50 rogues weren't popular yet. I got told that &quot;The warrior in group doublehits the damage you bstab, go away.&quot; This wasn't always the case and I quite a few friends too, but still didn't see them ever again.<br>
<br>
So even though you're right about the gimp rogues around (many of them have outleveled me already), when I started and played my rogue  up, there were only handful of 50-60 rogues in who list, which I tended to check pretty often.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Writing that &quot;random all would be fairest&quot; - I meant that if the items used to roll on the trade circle smoothly, everyone had the same &quot;average&quot; income in loots that drops.<br>
<br>
But then again your post woke me up to the thinking back... I had forgotten one pretty solid fact. Melee's tools are his/her weapons and equipment. Casters need gear too, I'm not saying that, but melee folks don't have spells, thus the part casters get from their spells is within melee's gear.<br>

<br>
For genuine good people (you can really tell it, most fall into this category, some don't) NBG makes the entire group happy (at least all the genuine good people in the group, the rest can jerk off for all I care).<br>
<br>
But as having grouped with gimps... well lvl 46 clerics in KC that want random for all, because they just got out of Guk... and of course wanting to random for all, when we were camping cappy.<br>
<br>
And among those gimps are those, who deliberately twist NBG like caster or epic ranger/rogue insisting on rolling on RBG (and sad part being, that they've got their will through eventually).<br>
<br>
So doing this so smoothly as I can, because I don't feel like getting toe to toe against Vendrix (have read enough of those), and I really don't disagree with him either... but also, what Feather stated earlier, the environment has changed.<br>
<br>
Eventually gimp population reaches 50+, and that has happened. The environment is totally different from what it was lessay 6 months ago. Heck 3 months ago. There were genuine good people in pickup groups. Twinks were rare sights 7-8 months ago when I did my 30-45 levelling. <br>
<br>
Now they reached 50+, and guess what... it's where all the &quot;One night in OS...&quot; and other theards come from. There isn't majority of them, but you need just 1/6 of population and on full group you have average one. Perhaps not in every group, but several in others. When the gimps class is cleric or some other requirement in the totally pickup group (pickup groups rarely think they can do anything without a cleric) - the situation gets even worse.<br>
<br>
So as an experiment, try out totally random pickup groups few times, if you haven't already. I don't know if its me, but the greedy fucks have really multiplied. <br>

<br>
All of you who know Nuzum da Witchdoctor (I don't know hiw much, but enough to assume), don't say he's greedy &quot;All your loot are belong to us&quot; - dude.<br>
<br>
But my post about greedy gimps being all over the place, is just to clarify so those of you, who haven't met it (you might group with friends, or in camps the gimps get some time to get into (remember your own comments in Velks, Vendrix? =)).<br>
<br>
So after working your ass off for group full of greedy shmucks or worse yet, group of who you can see fucking over the honest tank for some reason, you start really to play for yourself and those you call as friends. That doesn't mean you couldn't  make still new friends - we met wonderful people last nite in Velks with our bunch of friends... and actually those gimps help making good friends of people who get annoyed by them as well.<br>
<br>
But really you lose the taste &quot;giving&quot; to those loot whore idiots, even when they would taste the NBG, when you can already sense the trouble, if the drop doesn't seem to suit their classes NBG.<br>

<br>
Agree with Gurgle, most of those people who get their drive from loot don't enjoy the game and only get obsessed by getting better gear by ninjaing, or choosing people to help / area to raid only on their own perspectives.<br>
<br>
In the end they always find someone with better gear and are continuously bitter over that.<br>
