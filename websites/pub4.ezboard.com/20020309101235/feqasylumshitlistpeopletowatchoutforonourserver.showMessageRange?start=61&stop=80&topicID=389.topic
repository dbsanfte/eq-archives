<br>
<li> /petition, /report: Sadly the GMs and Guides don't ban accounts often enough, in my opinion. Yes, players make mistakes, but <b>mature</b> players rectify those mistakes rather than give some lame apology. Why would anyone want to take the risk of earning a bad rep when they can fix their mistake in-game <i>right then and there</i>?</li><br>
<br>
<li> Have the Player Removed from their Guild: So? An evil player can always find another guild.</li><br>
<br>
<li> /ignore: Doesn't do a lot except save sanity, but the evil player can still take their happy a$$ somewhere else to cause misery for others.</li><br>
<br>
<li> Refuse to Group with Them: Again, saves your sanity, but the player plods along oblivious to the effects their bad behavior has on others.</li><br>
<br>
What it comes down to is that the Shit List does serve a useful purpose. I read it from time-to-time just to see whom not to group with/deal with. You may feel it's a public pillory, but most of the people who end up a Shit List target have done some shitty things, and deserve some bad press for it.<br>
<br>
I've never dealt with Laaw in-game, but chances are I won't now. Apology's a fine thing, but he'll have to actually <b>do</b> a righteous load of atonement for what's gone on. I think the Shit List is useful in that I know whom to avoid.<br>

<br>
As far as you chat durring the event, you never asked anything. Perhaps you were feeling the rush of the moment and didnt realize what your actions would reap. <br>
<br>
Good luck to you and your rep, you have alot of mending to do. Not because of this post, but because people had things to post about you. <br>

  It's becoming quite apparent from your posts on this thread and others that you seem to believe belittling and denigrating the shitlist will lessen the effect of your having been posted. There are rules to posting here, and those rules are enforced by the moderators. The moderators do an EXCELLENT job. By slamming the list you are slamming the moderators. Single incidents will not stay up here. That is clearly stated in the rules. If no one confirms a character with additional incidents, the post will be removed after one week. You are correct that persons posting opinions about characters shitlisted have no place here, but persons posting confirming or contradicting experiences have every right to be here. That is how the list works. If no one had confirmed the single incident between you and Ricoh with additional incidents the post would have been removed in a week. Obviously that did not happen. Your unhappiness with being posted is still evident by the comments which you add to other threads. Most of those comments are just your opinion about the list reiterated. You don't seem to be posting to confirm or contradict the experiences of others in the threads I have seen your replies. Belittling the list itself only makes you seem as though you are crying &quot;sour grapes&quot;. The list works because the moderators care enough to do the unenviable task which they have taken upon themselves voluntarily, with no compensation for time invested. Anyone who actually does deserve to be posted here still has the opportunity to repent their unsocial behaviour and at least try to make amends and repair their reputation. I can't imagine doing any of the many things I have seen people posted for, but you can bet if my name was posted here I'd do whatever it took to repair the damage. NO item in game is worth a person's reputation if they care at all about that reputation. <br>

I dont think i am treated the right no one cares... moderators dont reply to mails sorry i cant see the rules are working here because in MY case they dont.<br>

Is a guild shitlistable or not ? I think not but i my case it was and still seems to be.<br>
I say i clearly again here NO ONE who replied to my thread ever met me (except the people who defended me after three months here) or know what happened really.<br>
<br>
I dont care anymore its just a game its just a charakter and i never did bad things with this charakter regardless what a Ricoh posted its simply not true but he reached his goal to ruin my reputation and not only mine... from my whole guild and thats still in the threads TITLE.

Since I have never met you or had any experiences with you, the only information I have to go on is what is posted here. Based on reading many months of posts, there is enough evidence IMHO that you may indeed be innocent. I am certainly willing to give you the benefit of the doubt at this point. So you are incorrect when you say that no one cares.<br>
<br>
I'm very sorry if you were posted here unjustly, but the list serves a good purpose (see Fistsa, Byars, et. al.) Reasonable people read these posts with a grain of salt. So I would encourage you to move on from here, and not dwell as much on it. <br>
<br>
Oh, and I wouldn't care if you were a purple Ubange with orange stripes. So long as you didn't get the group killed <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
But back on topic.  I saw Laaw the other day and made some (probably not so nice, heh) comment to him.  Following that he wouldn't leave me alone for about 15 minutes wanting to know why I said that and apologizing and explaining that he's trying to rectify his reputation and be a good guy.  He must have apologized 20 times, and I was already in tell hell so it was a bit annoying but the point I got was the guy REALLY REALLY wants to fix his reputation.  It sorta touched me that he was so motivated so I decided to post it here. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><br>

The kind of peeps that get their shitlist posting removed are not the ones that spam the boards insulting the list and the moderators, and then insulting anyone who disagrees with them.  People with attitudes like that are the ones who belong up here in the first place.<br>

<br>
This is what I see out of the whole situation.<br>
<br>
3 people posted problems they had with you directly, Ricoh, Sheana, Aadan. This is enough to keep you up on the list. You refuted all three, but generally if there are three different people, unrelated to eachother all saying Mirie is bad because X, people see your do not take your reasoning sieriously. At the end of your thread, the entire last page (and some of the 3rd) is made up of people supporting you. Yet, you post here bitterly saying that you are never forgiven or believed if you are posted here. <br>
<br>
Eh?<br>
<br>
Have you checked your own thread latley, everyone is saying &quot;Lock this, and give her a second chance&quot; and Xian posted saying that she has no problem locking this thread. <br>
<br>
If you did something wrong, (and by the stuff listed there, yes, I believe you might have. -MY OPINION) then you cannot complain about being listed. You did something wrong, you are sorry, and it seems to me that the Lanys community was ready to forgive you, and yet you cannot seem to let go of this. <br>
<br>
Just enjoy the game. Yeah you'll meet people you are going to be less forgiving. Theres nothing you can do about that. But most of us are willing to forgive and forget. I think your biggest stumbling stone is that you will have very little contact with alot of the population because you are on at times of low population. (I think. Correct me if I'm wrong) So most people will not have any contact with you at all, be it positive or negitive. People tend to remember negitive stuff, so this will be a problem. But if you act honorably and fairly word will spread that you are not acting the way that you are depicted on these boards. <br>
<br>
Acting bitter about it after you thread is (pretty much) resolved isn't going to help your case though, methinks.<br>

well my guild is attacked in my thread too from people i never seen, each time i trie to explain something i got bad comments.<br>
<br>
a while ago i was asking to remove the Guildname from the Title of the thread... nothing happened. The Guildname of the thread of Jesy was removed... but no reaction on my thread.<br>
<br>
yes i play in off peak hours and might never meet any of you in game.<br>
<br>
Leolan as well as Xian posted they would lock it... it never happened.<br>
<br>
Yes i feel left alone and talking to walls... <br>
i dont think that will change and i quit now writing here.<br>
<br>
Maybe someone of you meet me someday on Lanys and maybe you see the truth then.<br>
If you need help just ask me - if you choose to avoid me i dont take amiss<br>

Laaw has not changed at all I saw him Sunday at North wall in DL. I asked him if he was still a Ninja, he ran over to a group killing giant and tried to KS I guess no brainer since it was a full group.. BTW no the group did not /yell help. So a /shout was done to warn of this Ninja/KS'er was in zone he then ran off.. <br>
