And I sympathize with him. But I think alot of what he said, he could have said otherwise, so as not to have it missunderstood so much. <br>
<br>
Everyone should also realize that Miblis, being of middle-eastern decent (at least thats what I think from reading his posts) is also reacting to not only to the terrorist attacks, but also to the things people are saying about middle-eastern people. I can certainly understand how is he upset when people are calling for genocide in his native land/lands. <br>
<br>
I think he is wrong in wishing all these people to hell. It was hypocritical of him to say that considering the other things he said in the rest of his message and subsiquent posts. <br>
<br>
However. I also think its hypocitical of those who are critisizing him, to bash him because he is critisizing how people are responding/greaving for what happened. After all, that is all he is doing too. <br>
<br>
In the end. I think there is alot of misscommunication here. I have seen the posts he was quoting. <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Most of those people weren't &quot;greaving.&quot; They are opertunists, taking advantage of this crisis, and the general population's bereavement, to publicly release they're racist and sadistic ideas, without the fear of reprizals. </b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> I think it is this fact, that caused Miblis to overreact as much as he did. <br>
<br>
The others that truely are greaving but still saying harsh comments about middle-eastern people, should simply be reminded that there are many people who are just like them in the middle east: Innocent, scared, and confused. No one deserves to die except maybe those that commited these horrible crimes. Crimes, not just against America, or the western world, but against ALL of humanity. <br>

After the events that have happened, how dare you fucking come here and spout shit about eternal hell, rape, and torture. As far as I am concerned you can step out in front of a bus in the near future and remove one more terrorist sympathizer from the face of our nation.

Re: Hmm.. ignorance makes you look the fool<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
 What happened is very horrible, but please think about this.<br>
<br>
During ww2, Americans regarded Nazis as evil. Not just bad, but flat out evil. Why? They were evil because they were Nazis! They killed innocent people! why else? In truth, many Nazis were born and brought up to believe those ways, and were just humans doing what they thought was right.<br>
<br>
Now Palastine has been at war for many many years with a country that the US sold guns, missles, tanks, and helped finance. When a missle gets shot and kills innocent people. They know that missle came from America. That missle killed their brother, their sister, their mother daughter father or friends, all they did was believe in their country, and were doing what they were brought up to believe was right.<br>
<br>
To them America is the eppitomy(sp) of evil. America (in their eyes) has caused many many innocent human lives. Their husbands, wives, children, mothers and fathers were killed daily by our weapons. That is why they (the palastinian public) cheered of what happened. When Japan was nuked in WW2, many people rejoiced at the death of thousands of innocent japanese people. My grandmother even told me once, &quot;Thank god we nuked those bastards, or god help us of what would have happened.&quot; Back in the civil war, friends and family murdured eachother over what they believed. They killed other US citizens because they thought eachother were evil in not believing in their cause. I believe that this is very similar to what is going on now. In the Middle-East, we are the Nazi's, we are the Japanese, we are the south's north.<br>
<br>
There is a very good movie out, its called &quot;The Birth of a Nation.&quot; This movie was made in the 50's and was the first ful-length feture movie. It was a 2 hour long black and white film(no sound:P) about the civil war, and the birth of the KKK. The thing that made this movie so good, was that it was from the view of the south, and the KKK was portrayed as a good group of men, that protected the people of the south from the newly free'd negros and their evil ways. Now i know nobody that is reading this believes in the slavery in humans (as i do not either:P), but i bet you a million bucks that you would be rooting for the KKK at the end of this film. Its all about how you percieve the information. There was even a black girl that was glad they won in the end (in my film class).  <br>
<br>
I am a white American citizen, and i believe what happened was a very horrible thing. I know many people in New York... and I have yet to hear from many of them. What i am just trying to say is that them rejoicing doesn't make them evil. I know it brews nothing but hatred in many of you, but i for one am not a hateful man. I dont believe in war, i dont believe in fighting... ive been reffered to as a dirty hippie, a lazy bastard, as someone that doesn't support our country, just because I dont believe in bombing innocent people. There is always a story to each side, and that is rarely realized in times of war.<br>

You forget the fact that children of terrorism are terrorists themselves.  Terrorist children who are capable of walking have had bombs strapped to their bodies and have been sent into large groups of unsuspecting innocents only to have the child self detonate and kill everyone around.  Would you have the US say &quot;Oh..don't shoot hiim/her..he/she is only 9.  I know you see the 20 pounds of c4 strapped to their body but please don't shoot em.  Just let the kid walk on in to the well populated area and detonate..then we will clean it up later.&quot;  C'mon Mibilis..you can't possibly be that ignorant can you?  I guess maybe you can if you have worn blinders to past terrorist actions.<br>
<br>
Terrorist children are indoctrinated at birth.  This is a sad fact that we must be willing to face..and be ready to deal with.  Does this mean killing them..yes sadly it does.  I would have no remorse If I was in the military shooting a child with explosives or a gun in his hand at all.  Sorry but life deals out some real mother fuckers of situations and this is one.<br>
<br>
Mibilis..I really don't want to get into another flame war with you man..you can't be reasoned with because you are blind to anything outside your own experience.  You are the kind of person who would plead with the US not to retaliate..then when the same war happens again and more innocents die you would be right back pleading again for no retaliation.  You are a tool of a leftist brainwashed political machine that lacks a spine to deal with the harsh realities of human nature and fanaticism.  To you it is more noble to be a target than to defend yourself or your family.  You lack a true sense of caring, and are driven by idealist, and cowardly will to run and hide and sing &quot;feel good&quot; songs with others of your ilk after its over.<br>
<br>
I'm sorry I don't understand your like...and glad in a way I don't.  I can tell you though Mibilis..you are a huge minority in a world that doesn't lack the fortitude to do what needs to be done and frankly..your voice of dissention will be nothing but a whisper against the roar of retribution that we can only pray will be coming soon.<br>

If you really wanted to change what people thought you would be out there in the streets instead of on a message board (hopefully, someone will kill you because you're a self-righteous, self-absorbed, hateful asshole that we'd all be better off without).

What has changed is my support for the Palestinians. &quot;God helps those who help themselves&quot; goes an old expression. Helping yourself by committing and/or supporting the direst and vilest act of terrorism ever to occur has made me give up on these people once and for all.<br>
<br>
Gandhi achieved independence from Britain with non-violence.<br>
<br>
It can be fucking done! People CAN make a point and ACHIEVE GREAT THINGS without resorting to terror.<br>
<br>
I'm sorry to say this but if Palestinians and their supporters look back and wonder why any and all chance of a nation has evaporated; why their sons and brothers are in body bags or crippled for life, they need to look at their own back yard. They need to look at the wisdom of using violence to achieve an end.<br>
<br>
Martyrs and their deaths only mean something if it furthers a cause. They have furthered no cause as of the 11th of September 2001 than to imprint firmly on the minds of most people that they are savage, feral, mindless lunatics. And that opinion will take a VERY LONG time to wither away.<br>
<br>
Miblis, I wonder at your concern for Arabic people. I know we share similar beliefs on the State of Israel, but both of us are not directly connected to it or Palestinians. You mentioned that you were an American-born person of Persian heritage. I'm an Australian-born person of Hellenic heritage. I'll admit that my contempt for the State of Israel is purely academic. Surely yours is as well?<br>
What have Arabs done for Persians lately?<br>
As much as they have done for Greeks I imagine...<br>

Please explain this to me.  I would love to hear how you came to these beliefs.  I've never read anything that would lead me to buy into your graphic description of what YOU believe hell to be.  I'm glad that you gave me permission to NOT accept your beliefs; thank you.<br>
<br>
Now, BITE ME!<br>
<br>
I believe there is a hell.  But I have NO INKLING of what hell would be like.  Quite frankly, I have no intention of buying that one way ticket.  HOWEVER; I don't believe that you end up going there because you are &quot;racist&quot; or because you &quot;generalize&quot; any statements you make.  A lot of racism is ignorance, pure and simple.  Some people are just raised that way.  Others, that know the difference, but still choose to be racist are the ones that have to answer for that.  Do they deserve hell?  Better question... are you the one to make that call?  You need to quit being so &quot;holier than thou&quot;, come down off the Throne, and try being one of us now. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ulottexaenioc.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lotte Xaenioc</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 315<br> <font color=#E9D756>(9/14/01 7:00:20 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8.topic&index=77>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A special place in hell....</span><hr size=1> People post things in anger and rage. &quot;Kill em all&quot; denotes &quot;em&quot; as the people who are responsible for this attack. Not middle easterners in general.. <br>
<br>
Turkey is made up of middle-easterners and Turkey is a member of NATO. They are fully backing the US in the hunt and distruction of our attackers.<br>
<br>
&quot;em&quot; does not denote Muslims either.. the Muslim religion makes up approximatly 1/5 of the world's population. There are many different levels of the religion as there are many different levels of christianity. The people who did this act, if in fact they are Muslim they are the most extreme kind. They are the extreme kind of believers equivalent to only the most violent KKK members out there and then some. <br>
<br>
Not all muslims believe that if you die killing enemies of a Jihad (holy war) that you get a higher place in heaven. In fact most Muslims believe that violence is the worst possible thing one can do, in regaurds to the religion. <br>
<br>
Also.. Miblis, I understand you being upset that people wish your family dead simply based on ethnicity... But this isn't the way to make them open their eyes.<br>
<br>
On a side note.. if in fact your family did have something to do with the attack on the US, or if they cheered the attack.. (which I'm sure they did not) I would have to wish their deaths myself. <br>
<br>
People who play EQ are cool. Oh damn I generalized.. I guess I'm going to hell.<br>

War is not a precise tool of diplomacy that spares the innocent. Should we feel better about this? No. Is it nessecary? Yes. Why?  Because evil is best fought where it lives not where it wanders. The people responsible for this tragedy ARE evil and yes they most likely living right next to someone &quot;innocent&quot; and that these &quot;innocents&quot; die IS a tragedy but, to NOT fight the evil would be even more of a tragedy. <br>
<br>
<br>
As for persons being biggots for expressing their grief, shock and anger in a trying time. Kiss my ass. Not every one deals with thier grief and ager n the same way. My first response to this tragedy is &quot;I WANT SOME BLOOD!!!&quot; I guess I am evil  and a biggot too even though I spend my days serving others and thier needs so they might enjoy the freedoms of this great country.<br>
