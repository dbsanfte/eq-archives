Chiteng, if you're so sure you know what the 'The WHOLE truth' is, go find it yourself and post it here.  I'm talking about YOU looking through the threads, YOU finding the posts that support your ideas, and YOU posting links to those posts here.<br>
<br>
I'm getting sick and tired of you tell other people that they don't have the whole truth... why don't you actually go looking through these threads for a change instead of trying to up your post count with &quot;show me some proof&quot; posts!<br>
If you can show us 'The WHOLE truth', we will shut up, k? <p><hr><br>

The above line is from a post by one Reddoak #22<br>
<br>
I would say that it proves that you didnt know what you were talking about.<br>
That is 'my' version of the truth. You called me a liar, and I wasnt lying.<br>
It all depends on what the word 'hacking' means to you I guess.<br>
No he didnt 'hack' my account, but I didnt know that. I have a statement<br>
from Nuldar saying that he could understand why I felt it was possible.<br>
<br>
I think your credibility sux quite frankly. I dont see why anyone would take you seriously. But I suppose its nice to have 'freinds'.<br>

<br>
1) If Vendrix had destroyed an item loaned to him instead of returning it to its owner, what would you be saying about him?<br>
<br>
2) If Vendrix had taken items from another player and given them away to random people, what would you be saying about him?<br>
<br>
Would you be defending Vendrix as much as you're defending Mitch for doing those same things?  And don't get into the 'mitigating circumstances' crap.  There is no mitigating circumstance for the first one...the items owner requested the item back.  After some time when it was not returned (And we're talking on the order of days here, not like 10 minutes later), the owner got upset about not having received the item back and accused Mitch of steling it, so she destroyed it in response.  The only thing of note about the second event is that no one chose to report Mitch because they didn't like Pidnus either.  It doesn't change the fact that Mitch took Pidnus' stuff and gave it to other people. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uraedwulf.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Raedwulf</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_thatch.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 858<br> <font color=#E9D756>(3/7/02 12:43:02 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Chiteng the Mushroom</span><hr size=1> No, I didn't prove your point.  So why should I have mentioned Vendrix on Mortalis' board?  I was warning them about Mitch.  Do you think I needed to mention every scammer, exploiter, trainer, moron that has ever wandered onto EMarr?  In that case, I should have mentioned you, but I didn't.  Do you wanna know why?  It wasn't relevant.<br>
<br>
Whether Ven is Satan's gift to the server is irrelevant to the fact that Mitch admitted she stole something from someone and destroyed it out of spite.  Period.  The fact that OJ killed his ex-wife, is irrelevant to the fact that those two racist lawyers in Frisco allowed their dog to kill their neighbor.  The fact that Enron stock is in the dumper, is irrelevant to the fact that I'm going to Disneyland in a month.  The fact that Gary Coleman is a security guard 2 miles from my house, is irrelevant to the fact that Emanuel Lewis is back on TV.<br>
<br>
THE WHOLE TRUTH includes every bad action that has ever taken place since Eve bit that fruit in the Garden of Eden?  I don't think so.  The WHOLE TRUTH about Mitch being a thieving, spiteful bitch, only requires discussion of the incidents involved.  What &quot;more to the story&quot; do you think should have been mentioned?<br>
<br>
If you think that &quot;my version of events&quot; was somehow slanted, pray tell what other facts you believe should've been included.<br>
<br>
It's humorous to see you try and turn our arguments against us, but you must first understand them in order to do it properly.  Mitch admitted stealing the bracer and so did her victim.  Ven said he trained the entrance to Velks, but no one (except Mitch as part of a joking aside) ever claimed to have been trained by him.  As far as I can see, he was yanking your chaing.  After all, it's entertaining to see you have another seizure.<br>
<br>
No I won't be pretending or lying when I say that you cannot use your brain.  Regardless of your claims to the contrary, I disagree with your conclusion based upon the evidence before me.  Although you may pay lipservice to the realization that no one gives two virtual copper pieces for your opinion, does not mean you accept it.  Your presence here demonstrates that you actually believe your drivel has merit.<br>

<br>
If that is actually what you are trying to do.<br>
<br>
To answer your supposed actual question:<br>
<br>
If I were convinced that Mitch harmed another player willfully and without cause.<br>
(by the way, 'I' decide ALL those parameters, based on my own judgement)<br>
I would turn her in, in a heartbeat. And she knows that. But you know what?<br>
Neither of us care much about it. She isnt here. If you hadnt noticed. All this endless debate is moot. You win, she isnt here. Now go play. Just like debating<br>
if she is actually female. WHO CARES? What, are you looking to get laid?<br>
There are no women in Phoenix? (or wherever)<br>
<br>
Mitch is far greater than the sum of peoples accusations.<br>
The REAL reason people dont like her has nothing to do with any of the stated beefs. She wont knuckle under. She threatens the established order.<br>
Well that is too damn bad. If the order cant take one female monk objecting<br>
to it, then the order pretty much sux.<br>
<br>
You will NEVER win an argument with me, on the basis of character assassination.<br>

To clear it up for you, here's a list of my feelings about you and this thread to clear up any doubt whatsoever:<br>

- I feel that the statement you made about being hacked is a complete and utter lie.<br>
<br>
- You are the most annoying person on this entire board... yes, even more than Mitch!<br>
<br>
- You obvious attempts to put words into my mouth (post in this case) simply reinforces the second list item.<br>

- If there was ever a poll made about wheter or not to ban you, 99% of the people who responded would probably say heck ya! (hmm, anyone wanna make that poll?)<br>

Ok, from my take on all of this, you adamantly claimed originally that you were hacked.  Sliding down the thread, you started to try and weasel your way out of the statement, but the tone of the posts still suggested you firmly believed someone &quot;hacked&quot; into EzBoard to mess with you.  Never once did you say &quot;It's my opinion that...&quot;.  All you're doing is trying to pin me down saying that I'm calling an opinion of yours a lie.  Granted, nobody can call someone's opinion a lie, but your posts seemed scream out &quot;THIS IS A FACT!!&quot; That's why I called you a liar. <br>

You seem incable of making logical connections from point A to point B to point C.<br>
<br>
/example on<br>
<br>
For example, the IPScan thing:<br>
<br>
1) In an argumentative post with Raedwulf, you drop in a random comment about IPScan.<br>
<br>
2) In a separate post, you list some of the things IPScan can tell you about another computer<br>
<br>
3) In a 3rd post, you claim that your motive was to un-nerve Raedwulf.<br>
<br>
You claim it's not a threat simply because you never said the words 'raedwulf, I'm going to hack your computer with IPScan'.  Yet anyone with even rudimentary logical capability can link these 3 together and see that you were making a threat against Raed's computer.  And if this were to be translated into some RL situation that got you in court, I'm pretty sure a jury would find you guilty as well, even though you never said 'Raedwulf, I'm going to hack your computer'<br>
<br>
/end example<br>
<br>
No one is saying Ven is a saint.  No one is really trying to say that Mitch is satan either.  You challenged people to provide examples that Mitch was a thief.  That was done.  Yet you dismiss these statements simply because people have a 'vendetta' against Mitch, so these statements are not 'truth', even though Mitch has admitted to them as such.<br>
<br>
You keep harping on the person who owned the bracer pissing Mitch off...yet discard the fact that the person who owned the bracer only got inflammatory after initial attempts to retreive it were met with silence.<br>
<br>
And now some fun with quotes:<br>

I'd like to stress that impervious to logic part even further for ya Chiteng...<br>

As I actually read the thread involved, Areo indicated his annoyance and frustration in why it was taking so long for Mitch to return his bracer, and wondered why she wouldn't give it back.  Whether he made allegations that she sold it or otherwise, is irrelevant to the matter at hand.  Whether she felt she was slandered or not is beside the point.  [The fact that Mitch was there in the thread permitted her to defend herself, too.]<br>
<br>
Second, I refuse to try and slip into Mitch's mind (it would be quite disturbing, I'm sure) to see whether she WANTed to destroy the bracer, or whether she was PMSing to a new level and was overwhelmed in anger.<br>
<br>
Third, there is no such thing as a dichodomy.  Nor is there anything about which a &quot;dichotomy&quot; might be applicable.  I stated the facts:  She had a bracer of another, she got annoyed at the lender, she destroyed it.  You can claim that the time of day, month, people present, arrangement of stars or Pop-Tarts at your asylum are relevant, but the facts remain.  They aren't matters of opinion.  They are straight from the ass's horse.<br>
<br>
Fourth, I already admitted I went to their board to cause trouble.  Just like Mitch and you do here.  Neither of you belong here, either.  You're both troublemakers, at least in your own heads.  As I haven't assassinated anyone's character, here or there, your use of the term &quot;MORE&quot; is misplaced.  One must have character for it to be assassinated, hence, you and Mitch are proof against such things. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=96910">My Crappy Stuff</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/udwarkarn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dwarkarn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 3228<br> <font color=#E9D756>(3/7/02 3:15:49 pm)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Chiteng the Blind</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> You still called me a liar, and I proved I wasnt lying.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

It was Areo's bracer (one of his twinks actually), but that shouldn't really matter.  The point is, which I stated in another post that obviously you skipped, it wasn't Mitch's.  It did not matter if she got pissed off.  The only circumstance that would have mattered is if Areo had told Mitch to destroy it.  That is not the case.  But, like Aganerral said (that's a-g-a-n-e-r-r-a-l) you refuse to use logic when it comes to her.<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> All you are telling me is that Mitch is no worse than Vendrix.

However you choose to <br>
portray what you are doing as explaining something.<br>
<br>
My post was a responce to Aganerral. It was clearly labled as such. That never matters to you I know, but IF you find something that doesnt suit you, that is hardly my problem, UNLESS the post is made to you. My answers were completly appropriate for responce to his prior post.<br>
<br>
Aganerral keeps trying to portray my dislike of Vendrix and somehow discordant<br>
to my liking Mitch. That is all it is, a potrayal. <br>
<br>
If Mitch has done something wrong in-game, report her. To me that is self-evident.<br>
If you refuse to report it, that implicitly condones it. In which case, I am not<br>
going to get excited about it.<br>
<br>
The only person I see with a LEGITIMATE issue on the topic of Mitch at all<br>
is this Aero person. As it happens Aero is in my guild. We go back quite a ways,<br>
several years in fact. He hasnt said anything to me at all about this issue.<br>
Somehow I think he has other things on his mind. He and I do speak,<br>
everytime I log in. So it isnt simply lack of opportunity.<br>
<br>
Since you all lauded Mitch when she kept the bag, the Pidnus issue is a joke.<br>
<br>
Now I will state one last time. If anyone has a serious issue that clearly shows<br>
Mitch harming another player willfully, I will listen. None of you have done that.<br>
None of you WILL do that. That is because I strongly doubt ANY of the alleged<br>
complaints have any merit to them at all. You just enjoy hailing on Mitch.<br>
You dont even have the guts to admit it.<br>
<br>
You actually go so far as to make shit up to complain about.<br>
Tell me, how does that differ, from what you claim I do with issues<br>
regarding say Vendrix? If it is bad for ME to act in a certain way, it certainly<br>
seems it should be bad when other people do the same.<br>
<br>
But enough<br>
