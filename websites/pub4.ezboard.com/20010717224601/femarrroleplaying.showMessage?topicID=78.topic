Then with a last echoing scream it grew silent.  The silence would not last long, and the harsh wailing of a newborn child soon would pierce the ears of all those present.  The infants mother lays dead , while everybody stares at the child,  its body twisted and slightly deformed, their hearts soon filled with contempt and hatred. <br>
<br>
The child's would be father slowly picks up his son, and begins to slowly walk away.  The surrounding family members in silent agreement know what will be done.  Slowly walking through the many streets and dank corridors of Ak'anon the father with his unnamed son soon enter into the hot muggy night of Steamfront.<br>
<br>
Slowly he made his way pass the night watchmen, following the neglected dirt road until dawn.  As the sun rose slowly over the surrounding mountains he lay his bundle of unwanted flesh at the foot of the ancient Marking Stones, leaving it as a feast to the infected rats and the wandering Kobold marauders that plague the Steamfront Mountains.  Turning away he slowly made his way back to Ak'anon, never taking a care to look back, never caring about his own son.<br>
<br>
The sun would soon rise over Steamfront, and the child left alone crying, not knowing anything else the cries are its only action it knows.  The child's cries did not go unnoticed, a group of scavenging Kobold's heard the infants cry's and began to ascend upon the mound where the Marking Stones were set.  But by luck, or by divine intervention, a sudden loud crackling noise filled the air, and two slender beings of medium built stepped through what seemed to be a tear in the fabric of reality.  One was a male wood elf in full shimmering plate mail armor, the other was a female wood elf with long brown hair and a mighty glowing crook.  The sights and sounds were enough to scatter the Kobold band.<br>
<br>
    &quot;Well now, that was a interesting fight wouldn't you say dear?&quot; said the male elf whilst cleaning some blood and sinew off of his blade.<br>
    &quot;Only if you could fight as well as you say you could we wouldn't have to keep escaping back here now would we!&quot; said the female wood elf in a highly aggravated tone of voice.<br>
    &quot;Now, now don't get so aggravated&quot; he paused and slowly began to message her back. &quot;You know I don't purposely mean to get us into trouble.&quot;<br>
The slow message slowly began to wind her down, &quot;I know.&quot; she would finally answer.  &quot;You know its almost breakfast, we should get back home.  I bet Kegolan will be up soon and he will want breakfast.&quot;<br>
<br>
The female elf began to wave her hands and chant some words as a mystical aura covered her and her husbands hands.   Suddenly she stopped, and the aura quickly dissipated.<br>
<br>
    &quot;Why did you stop casting?&quot; inquired the male elf.<br>
    &quot;One moment, I see something over there.  Its moving, what do you suppose it is?&quot; she replied.<br>
<br>
As they both walked over the bundle, they where shocked to see a baby gnome (or what appeared to be a baby gnome) wrapped up in a tattered green cloth blanket.  The female elf quickly picked up the child and checked if it was all right, after a rigorous inspection she finally said:<br>
<br>
   &quot;Who could do such a thing???&quot; she questioned.<br>
   &quot;I don't know, maybe its a gnome thing.  Maybe we should just leave it, I really don't want to mess with any gnome stuff.  Their tinkering and strange habits really make me uneasy, you heard of those stories about their communal baths and stuff.&quot; he replied while squinting his eyes and imitating the motions as if he had a stomach ache.<br>
    &quot;I think we should take him with us, we have never seen a child here before after all the times we have been here willing or not (she glares at him threatingly).  He has probably been abandoned, just look at him he wouldn't be able to survive for even another hour.&quot; she would say in a very commanding voice.<br>
    &quot;Uuuhhh... whatever you think is best hon...&quot; he would reply in a sheepish tone of voice.  <br>
<br>
She began to wave her hands and chant, mystical auras covered her hands and those belonging to all around herl<br>
<br>
    &quot;My mother said she would be the domineering type.&quot; He wispered to himself.<br>
    &quot;What did you say?!?!&quot; She quickly responded  in a harsh voice  <br>
 <br>
Then with a sudden crackle and some sparks the two elves and the gnome child where gone.     <br>
