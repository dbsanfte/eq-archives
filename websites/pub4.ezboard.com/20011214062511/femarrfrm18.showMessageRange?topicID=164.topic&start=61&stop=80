What these people need to realize is, NOW IS THE TIME TO MAKE YOUR REASONS HEARD. But once the gverment decides a course of action that the majority of our nation agrees on and if that action requires a draft (something I doubt due to the massive reserves and volunteers we would have), then you shut up about your personal opinion and you go to serve your country. <br>
<br>
If you don't, then you are not American. You can say what you will about personal freedom of decision, but when your country calls you go. Even if you disagree. Otherwise you can run and basically abandon your country and people. But don't complain 20 years from now when those people still consider you a coward and the country you abandoned does not want you back. You make your decision freely, but don't think you can run and then show back up a few years after the war and its 'game on, lets continue as if nothing ever happened'. <br>
<br>
Main point reiterated: Express your discontent now and be heard, but if once we have our course of action then follow it. If you don't, you are a Traitor by our law and deserve treatment in accordance with your crime. And if you don't think that running from a draft makes you a traitor, I suggest you contact a lawyer and verify.<br>
<br>
ps. you could still serve the 5 years for refusing to take up arms and remain an american. I find it sad that anyone would consider giving up their citizenship instead.

If you find it too long to actually read, that's fine, but don't respond to it then.<br>
<br>
Let me start by defining the terms I'm arguing about, since a lot of you are misunderstanding what I'm getting at, and I figure I haven't made myself clear enough yet. I am not arguing about whether or not America should do anything about what happened (although incidentally, I think America certainly should). I'm not trying to argue whether or not this should bring about a war. I never said it is wrong to fight for what you value, when it becomes necessary.<br>
<br>
This entire thing, for me, is a protest to a government that wants to force people to fight for them—the draft—and about the root of that, which is basically altruism. Altruism is the belief that selflessness is a virtue; that men should serve one another. All references to unquestioning obedience (&quot;duty&quot;) owed to others is a form of altruism. I disagree with every premise of that. I stand by the fact that when one man eats, it is only he that is nourished, and no one else, no matter how much he eats. Humans are not a collective whole. We are individuals, no matter how much anyone tries to change this.<br>
<br>
There are people whose aim is to make themselves happy. They do this because it is painfully obvious that making oneself happy is pleasurable.<br>
<br>
There are people who enjoy helping others. They do it for the knowledge and feeling of making someone happy. This amounts to doing it to <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> make themselves happy</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.<br>
<br>
Let me say that if I was to have someone beside me in a war, I'd sure as hell prefer the man who has the self-respect to think and live for himself (and to protect with a passion all things that influence this) over a man who doesn't think that he is worth enough to fight for (which is indeed the definition of &quot;selfless&quot;), and that the final arbiter of everything is what the majority thinks.<br>
<br>
When people speak of serving the majority, or society, or the public, or the whole, or the collective, or whatever name they wish to give it, do you ever stop to think of the exact meaning of those terms? When someone speaks to someone else of it, they refer to that all-important majority that is defined as being made up of &quot;everyone—except you.&quot; Follow that logic. What that basically leads to is the conclusion that nobody has self-worth. If you are not worth anything, then what could be good in my helping you? What could be good about a majority made up of people who are worthless?<br>
<br>
I don't follow that line of &quot;thought.&quot; I understand that all groups of people are groups of <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> individuals</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->. I hold that the only worth that can be derived from someone is by his will to live for himself.<br>
<br>
Then there are people that will say I should love and care for everyone equally. This is horribly wrong. Anyone who loves everyone equally has no values. What it amounts to is someone saying that the greatest man is equal to the most worthless beggar.<br>
<br>
I'm not going into some debate about whether I am objectively more important than anyone else—that has no place in this specific argument. What I am saying is that I am important to <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> myself</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->. Think of this in broader terms than you have been. That I am important to myself does not mean I have no regard for others; it simply means I am not willing to <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> sacrifice</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> myself for others.<br>
<br>
When I say &quot;sacrifice,&quot; I mean it as taking a loss. I do not think of it as a sacrifice to work hard in order to earn one's keep, as I've heard it being referred to. To paraphrase Ayn Rand, it isn't a sacrifice to do without certain luxuries in order to feed your baby, <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> if</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> you care more about sustaining and nourishing your baby than you do for having said luxuries. It <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> is</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> a sacrifice, though, to let your baby die in order to feed the neighbor's baby instead, if you personally cared more for your baby than for your neighbor's.<br>
<br>
Do you see more clearly what I am getting at? So long as you are comprehending what it is I am arguing, I really don't care if you disagree with me. What this means is that you have no grounds to call me a coward. The term that most of you will be looking for (if you haven't found it already) is &quot;selfish,&quot; although I take pride in the title while you will mean to condemn me with it. With that said, let me get to responding to all these posts...<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Muzaak:<br>
I only hope you learn something about loyalty before it is too late for you. We all someday face our enemies and they never are our own.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->My very being is the antithesis of &quot;loyalty.&quot; I have no respect for someone's ability to obey, as it takes no thought or conviction to do so (fast proof: a dog can do it). And who is to say that we never face our own enemies? Why would anyone face anything else? If someone comes and tries to harass my girlfriend, he becomes <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> my</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> enemy as well as hers, because I value her. So when I go to main this person who is harassing her, I do it out of self-interest. It is not selfless.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Kytherion:<br>
And yet you will seek to derive the benefit. The luxuries you've enjoyed, the freedom you've had, the society from which you have received protection all of your life...and you'll flee when your turn comes. You might tell yourself that you've earned these things through working hard and paying taxes, as if punching a time clock or getting a college degree is difficult.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Let me say again that those people didn't give me freedom. They fought those who were trying to take freedom away. Depending on each individual that was there, they may or may not have been specifically aiming to keep everyone in the future safe as well. But it wasn't a contract that was offered to <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> me</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> to sign. I owe them nothing, and what I choose to do in their memory is up to me alone.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Lanarie:<br>
Do you think America would be the same place if it would have sat by and coward in the corner during the two world wars while Europe was decimated? Should we have just ignored the attack on Pearl Harbor?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Did I ever say people should have sat back? The people who signed up for the military went and fought. I respect that. But they made their choice and I made mine.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Caoilfhionn:<br>
Something tells me you'd have been sitting there with your head between your knees trying not to puke. It's just a feeling I get.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Come back when you learn to speak in thoughts, and not feelings. I can't even ask why you think that, because you made it apparent you won't be giving any logical reasons.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Caoilfhionn:<br>
I suppose you would have stood on the street pondering how important this was to your day to day life, and whether or not this act justified your moving to a fellow humans assistance. I suppose you'll come back at me and tell me that it was their job. Well, I can tell you I've seen numerous reports of every day citizens, not rescue workers, going above and beyond, instead of hiding in their closets, as you'd have us believe is the right thing to do.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Um...no. I'm well aware that a lot of people love to help others. I never said there's anything wrong with it; I respect them for doing what they decided they wanted to do. What's wrong is when you <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> expect</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> everyone to have a love of helping others.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Caoilfhionn:<br>
Tell me. When does this become your fight? When it's your sister? When the building your mother works in crumbles to the ground? When the house next door to you is bombed? God forbid, when you yourself are attacked? Based on your principles, I should get some damn popcorn and watch your house burn to the ground, solely on the basis that, hey, I don't know you, you don't affect me, and why should I stick my neck over the line for you?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->It becomes my fight when there is an apparent threat to me and all I care about. If you live next door to me some day, and terrorists come and burn my house down, and you sit out on your porch and watch without doing a thing, I won't harbor any anger for you. I don't think that you or anyone else are required to serve my interests over your own. If your personal interest includes saving those around you, go ahead. You'll make those people happy. But don't yell at me if I have no desire to make everyone I meet happy, and refuse to sacrifice myself for others' happiness.<br>

This is all about being drafted. Do at least you understand that rebelling against a draft is a form of fighting to defend myself and my freedom?<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Poppen Steelfist:<br>

Why don't you and Triff tell the 5000+ plus innocents who died Tuesday that you don't care to fight for their memory? Why don't you visit a school and tell the young school children you don't have the testicular fortitude to be men and defend them.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Case closed? Aren't you going to at least tell me <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> why</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> I owe my life to the government? Sorry, but I don't consider someone else's &quot;need&quot; as a claim upon anyone's work or time. And I see your comments at the end as an attempt to guilt me. I bet you're not counting on me to say that I could tell both those who died and those school children that I am not willing to fight for the memory of those who died, nor to protect them, if I have no personal interest in them. My interest is in fighting for myself if it comes to that.<br>

That's not the problem. What I am saying is that that I care about my personal interests far more than I do about all the others. You are apparently making no distinction between your son and everyone else in the country. I'm not afraid to fight for my ideals, but I'm not willing to be forced to fight for anyone else.<br>

<br>
First:<br>
Let me say that if I was to have someone beside me in a war, I'd sure as hell prefer the man who has the self-respect to think and live for himself (and to protect with a passion all things that influence this) over a man who doesn't think that he is worth enough to fight for (which is indeed the definition of &quot;selfless&quot;), and that the final arbiter of everything is what the majority thinks.<br>
<br>
That last sentence should end, &quot;and <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> who thinks</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> that the final arbiter of everything is what the majority thinks.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
Second:<br>
My very being is the antithesis of &quot;loyalty.&quot; I have no respect for someone's ability to obey, as it takes no thought or conviction to do so (fast proof: a dog can do it). And who is to say that we never face our own enemies? Why would anyone face anything else? If someone comes and tries to harass my girlfriend, he becomes my enemy as well as hers, because I value her. So when I go to main this person who is harassing her, I do it out of self-interest. It is not selfless.<br>
<br>
Second to last sentence should read, &quot;So when I go to <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> maim</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> this person who is harassing her, I do it out of self-interest.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
Third (and worst):<br>
For what little I have of it, personally, I pay the tax money that funds the intelligence agencies and military to do the jobs they signed up to do. I do not recognize anyone's right to force me to go take those jobs too.<br>
<br>
First sentence was meant to be &quot;For what little <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> opinion</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> I have of it, personally, I pay the tax money....&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uceldor.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Celdor</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ultrafx.com/note.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 1183<br> <font color=#E9D756>(9/17/01 5:58:25 pm)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> <BR><img src=http://home.austin.rr.com/mav1973/aegishjalmr.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Happy Typos</span><hr size=1> It's not about obeying, Triff.

Yet when the time comes to fight for that, to pay for the services America has rendered to you, you will not consider it because you refuse to be told what to do with your life.<br>
<br>
Lots of people feel this way. Criminals, drug users, terrorists, a whole gamut of folks that feel the law applies to everyone else BUT them.<br>
<br>
Selective service is a law, if you maintain your citizenship you are bound by it. If you refuse to honor it, you are a CRIMINAL. If that's ok with you, fine. I could care less, but don't expect me to care any more when you find that there are punishments for being a criminal.

<br>
I pay taxes that pay the people who organize, run, and work for the government and military. What I don't understand is where you get the idea that I should be required to pay more. I am already financing their ventures and decisions. What the draft asks is that I disregard the fact that I already paid and that I drop my life and go fight because they think I ought to. I do not agree with this. Therefore, if I were to comply with them, all I would be doing is obeying (because the alternative is acting on what I think is right). What this means you <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> are</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->, in fact, telling me to obey.<br>
<br>
It's interesting to me, how you portray that list of people who won't submit to authority. Anyway, I don't think the law &quot;applies to everybody but me.&quot; As you would've seen if you weren't just skimming through my post, I don't think the draft should be a law, period. I don't think it should apply to anyone at all.<br>

<br>
How would our goverment function if the bank robber told the cops &quot;I don't think robbing banks should be against the law, because my personal beliefs override any of those of the majorities that wrote the law&quot;? <br>
<br>
Can you quickly see how that would lead to anarchy?<br>
<br>
And don't hand me anything about the British empire again because the reason why we fought against their authority was because we did not have representation in the House of Commons/Lords and felt we were being discriminated against in trade etc. You have representation if you vote, and no one is singling you out in respect to having to follow the law.<br>
<br>
Finally, I really don't care what you do. In every major conflict (even WWII) we have had those who refused to fight and disavowed themselves from our country. Just don't expect sympathy for your plight later when you can't return to the US or have to hide in fear evading the law for the rest of your days. <br>

This will be my last post. You can't reason with people who think the law doesn't affect them. You can only laugh your ass off when that attitude comes back to bite them in the ass.<br>

p.s. Next time a cop stops you for speeding, don't pull over.

What you are using is a defense mechanism called Rationalization (freud) to deny your true motives for not wanting to be drafted. Your true motives are too disturbing for you to deal with consciously, therefore you make up other excuses, such as &quot;I don't want to fight because they say so&quot;. Personally, I percieve that you are scared to enter a war. Theres nothing wrong with that, I think everyone who enters a war is scared. <br>
<br>
 Note: I'm not a big fan of Siggy Freud but he hit the nail on the head with his theory of defense mechanisms IMO.<br>
<br>
 Secondly, you say that you do not want to be a sheep by entering the draft, but you are in fact a sheep by paying your taxes, obeying the laws of the USA, and by being a good moral person.

I'm not going to go into the whole cut and paste quote thing because you're not worth the amount of effort it would take to do so, just wanted to respond to a couple of things that got to me.<br>
<br>
A.  I would rather NOT fight alongside someone who is only concerned for himself.  He's too busy watching his own ass to watch mine.  I value someone who is willing to sacrifice himself to save others much, much more then some gutless, selfish brat.<br>
<br>
B.  No matter how many ways you paint it, you are a coward.  It makes me want to puke when I read your posts.  Justify your stance a million times, defend yourself in a million different ways, you are still a spineless coward and everyone who has read your drivel knows it.<br>
<br>
C.  Kytherion's right.  You signed up for selective service.  You are required BY LAW to fight if drafted.  If you don't want to honor our laws and fight for the PRIVELEDGE of living in the United States of America, then fucking leave.  And don't give me this bullshit about being forced to do what you don't want to do.  Makes you sound even more like a selfish brat every time you say it.  I, and most people, have to do things we don't want to do every stinkin day, but we do it because it is necessary.  It's part of life.<br>
<br>
And to all these strategic geniuses we have on our message boards, tell me this:  what is it you know that our joint chiefs, generals, admirals, etc. don't?  You say that standard military action isn't effective in this kind of battle when I hear on the news that leaders in the Pentagon say that ground troops will be very effective against our enemy.  So please, regale us with your military brilliance and tell us ignorant folk how it is YOU would do it?<br>
<br>
Just one final message to all those that don't believe in fighting for their country (and I hate to sound too redneck, but I am from the south <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ):<br>

The sad thing is..when this is all over..our soldiers will come home..some of them..and you will still be here...gloating over the fact that above all else you lived.  Your freedom will be intact, payed by a price that others have given so that you can lived safely in your vanity without regard to the fact that you failed to join a brotherhood of mankind, and rather put yourself above the fray since you appear to be destined for &quot;greater things&quot;...which in reality are nothing more than glorified attempts to conceal bitter yellow cowardice.

<br>
Considering I had absolutely 0 RL friends/aquaintances that were affected by this, my opinion should give you some idea of the spirit in which this country was founded.<br>
<br>
At the risk of sounding like a recruiting video...<br>
<br>
I would and will show up to the draft spit shined shoes with clean underwear and a crew cut if we instate a draft and I am called.  There are no ifs, ands, or buts about it, I am there, and I will be there showing all the honor and dignity that befits an American willing to stand up for the freedom that has been handed to me my entire life.  Considering I have lived my life with a silver spoon in my mouth thanks to the valiant bravery of our forefathers, I feel it is my duty, and every citizen's (who claims this country as their own) duty to uphold the ideals of our great nation, and that means fighting for the very freedom that you have had without cost for your entire life.  I am sorry, but taxes don't mean jack when you are talking about repaying your government for peaceful existance on your own soil for over 200 years (with the exception of the one attack on Pearl Harbor).  You pay taxes to build roads and bridges and keep up the day to day operations of the nations government so that your hometown doesn't end up looking like a scene from the movie &quot;Aftermath,&quot;  not as recompense for the freedom you have enjoyed your entire life.<br>
<br>
Think of all those men and women who have given their lives so that you can have the right to come to this board and cry that you don't want to go to war.  Honor those men and women by keeping their cause alive, do not let them have died in vain so that we could become a nation of spineless cowards that doom ourselves to destruction because we are too gutless to stand up and say, &quot;HEY! Knock off your crap, you're dealing with Americans and you are NOT going to get away with killing innocent people, ON or OFF our soil.&quot;  Show your children that it is nobler to fight for justice so that others can live in freedom, free of terror and fear.  Ask yourself, do you REALLY want to be cowering in a corner for the rest of your life afraid that the people who did this are going to strike again?  Do you want your children to have to?  Or do you want to rid that fear from the lives of all Americans?  You have been given a great gift, if a draft is issued, it is time to put up or shut up, do you want this freedom?  Do you want to live in a country that stands for dignity, honor, and peace?  War is not glorious, it is not to be romanticized, but if we do not fight for what we believe in, who will?  And why should they sacrifice themselves to give you, one who wouldn't stand up for yourself, not because you couldn't, but because you didn't want to, the peace of mind that comes with knowing that the perpetrators of this crime have been brought to justice? <p><a href=http://afflictionguild.com/scripts/member.x?username=Aphroditex&charactername=Aphroditex>Aphroditex Bubblefists</a></b>;  Serenity Z'Chaotic; Pickett Pocketts<BR>

Draft Dodgers:  People refuse to fight when their country declares war for a variety of reasons including religious conviction, philosophical differences, self interest ... the two themes that I've seen mentioned here appear to point to the latter examples.  And the reality is, there is nothing to be said to them that will change their minds.  Personal attacks serve only to make them dig in their heels and defend their choice more adamantly.  <br>
<br>
The truth is either you see this as an attack on Americans and take it personally as an American.  Or you see it as an attack on the freedoms for which America stands and there fore on yours or your communities freedoms.  Or you see it as an attack on the United States as a disembodied symbol and establishment to which you have little or no connection regardless of your residence.<br>
<br>
How will you as an individual know there is enough proof to 'go after' the individuals or organizations responsible?  I don't think you can.  Among other things, you aren't willing or capable of collecting the evidence, compiling it, and drawing conclusions.  That is part of what we expect our government and its resources to do for us.  We elect representatives and a president and ask them to review the information placed before them and to take appropriate actions.  Part of being a citizen of a democratic rebublic is trusting those who we have put in power to do the right thing, at the right time.  Does this mean we should blindly follow or grant them carte blanche?  No.  Does this abrogate our responsibility to pay attention and be as informed as possible about what is happening in the world?  Of course not.  But we also should avoid jumping to conclusions about what should and should not be done and how we will or will not support it.  The point can be argued ad nauseum during this period of fear and anger, but its all wind in the dark until all the evidence is in and a decision has been made.  I doubt The United States will do anything dramatic without the support not only of her own citizens but the international community.<br>
<br>
What IS the correct action to take?  Well, actually this is an unecessary question.  We want Justice.  We want the individuals and organizations responsible to be punished.  We want those who supported and harbor the guilty to also suffer for protecting those who have murdered innocents.<br>
<br>
The issue really turns on the question of collateral damage.  How much are we willing to accept?<br>
<br>
Do you really believe that our government or the people who support it want to murder innocents in order to bring the guilty to justice?   I don't.  But I am aware that minimizing the possiblility of causing the death of those who are themselves victims of terrorists or innocent bystanders means that justice will not be a swift as my anger would like it to be.  My thirst for vengence is dissatisfied by the possiblility that some of the perpetrators of this atrocity might get to live a long while, and that some, as sick as it makes me feel, some might even get away with it, and pass their social illness on to others.  However I have to believe that the majority will be punished.<br>
<br>
Another reality is that the world is not a perfect place and never has been.  As great as the United States is, as many friends as we have in the International community, we cannot deny the fact that there are also those who hate us with a fervor that burns like the fires of Hell.   And this past week - we were shaken from our complacency and forced to recognize this to be true.  What we cannot and must not allow these terrorists to do is to fracture our unity or break our resolve to persevere and prosper. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ukytherion.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kytherion</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 246<br> <font color=#E9D756>(9/17/01 9:02:06 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Well...</span><hr size=1> &quot;Not everyone who chooses not to fight is a coward.

<br>
Indeed. There are many positions in the armed forces which do not place the soldier in the position of having to kill anyone.<br>
<br>
I think I recall a certain field medic who served in the Pacific during WW2. A 7th Day Adventist I believe...I'm pretty sure he was awarded the Medal of Honor. Kept charging into enemy fire to pull out the wounded.<br>
<br>
On the other hand, I'm personally acquainted with a Jehovah's Witness. According to him, they aren't allowed to be involved at all. I admit I'm not all that keen on going off to fight while he wanders around knocking on people's doors to distribute religious pamphlets.<br>
<br>
It's a fine line, I think. Serving your country doesn't necessarily mean inflicting violence on others, but it does mean service.<br>
<br>
If it were up to me, I'd say that Adventist can stitch me up anytime, and that Jehovah's Witness can distribute copies of The Watchtower while he's in prison and/or France. But that may be a bit hard line. =)<br>

<br>
For you people that 'think' that this great country was founded based on 'selfless service and sacrifice for the sake of others:'<br>
<br>
I suggest you Think again.  They fought for themselves...and the freedom of the rest was a concern, but NOT the prime justification.  These men committed treason.  It was not to be taken lightly.  They knew it and did it anyway, because they, themselves, were not willing to sacrifice their <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> own</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> lives as a means to the ends of others. ...and I for one am glad, grateful and solemnly proud of their choice of battles.  But it only means something to me because they didn't have to do it, they chose to.  They did not do it for me and I don't delude myself into pretending they did--nor would I want them to!!!!  Patrick Henry did <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> not</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> say &quot;Give them liberty or give me death&quot;  ... he said &quot;...I know not what course others may take; but as for me, give me liberty or give me death!&quot;<br>
<br>
They also used the best technology available to them at the time.  <br>
<br>
Glade, we <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> do</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> know where the terrorists are; we've known for a long time which countries make a practice of harboring terrorists and condoning terrorism against freedom.  'We have the technology' -let us now use it.  We should bomb every man, woman, child and animal in those countries.  I don't know about the rest of you, but that woman (on the west bank celebrations) on TV saying how she wished all of her children would grow up to be that brave told me exactly how deep their hatred of us (representatives of freedom) runs and how well we need to exterminate them, their families, their children and those that hide and or protect them ...even those who don't openly agree with them yet actively hide them.  But a 'prolonged military campaign' is <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> not</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> the answer.  ..it smells strongly of propaganda, and yes it will cost many unnecessary American (and potentially ally) causualties of war.  4,700+ is more than enough Americans dead already. This BS can be taken care of once and for all.  'We have the technology'<br>
<br>
Triff's post advocates nothing more (and nothing less!!) than rational self-interest, as our founding fathers also advocated.  Their commitment was to the principle of <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> individual</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> rights, and of fighting off the yoke of tyrants.  Triff hasn't said he wouldn't fight; he's said he doesn't recognize your (or anyone's) 'right' to sacrifice him for their (your or your child's) sake.  The winning team will be made of such people, a team of individuals; each fighting for his own rights, freedom and life.  Americans.<br>
<br>
Here's an Ayn Rand quote for ya:<br>
&quot;What most people are evading today is the realization that under the lip service they are paying to an anti-totalitarian crusade, they have accepted all the basic premises of a totalitarian philosophy.&quot;<br>
<br>
How ironic that those throwing the word 'coward' around so much are themselves the moral cowards.<br>
<br>
For any of you who might be interested in authors that hold/held beliefs supporting <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> individual</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> rights, I'd suggest reading articles/books/etc. by Aristotle, Ethan Allen, Patrick Henry, John Locke, Thomas Jefferson, Thomas Paine, Elihu Palmer, Ayn Rand, Ludwig von Mises, George Washington.  (you opposers -to subservience of the individual to the collective- may wish to read up on Your philosophical forefathers: Hitler, Kant, Lenin, Marx just to name a few) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uaphroditex.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aphroditex</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 49<br> <font color=#E9D756>(9/17/01 9:08:45 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://mayuan.ntsj.com/gohanssj2.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Well...</span><hr size=1> Don't get me wrong, I personally could never bring myself to actually kill someone, but it will not preclude me being there when my country calls me to defend the freedom that has been handed to me.
