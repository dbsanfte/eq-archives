<br>
If you cant kill Aaryonar, you have no business in NToV.  Period.  As a couple people said already, Aaryonar is there for a reason, we did not create him and put him there, VI did.  WHY?  Because they obviously wanted to make it less trivial than the other wings of ToV.  Do you have to kill a big nasty to get into West wing?  NO!  The named there are relatively hidden so you can avoid them if you can't do them (except for LtK at the zone out, and port outs get you around her).  Do you have to kill a big nasty to get into HoT?  NO!  Again, the named there can be easily avoided by guilds who may be capable of farming HoT for armour, but are not quite ready for that &quot;next step&quot;.   <br>
<br>
Aaryonar is NOT an easy fight!  You CANNOT get past him to the rest of the dragons if he is up.  You can not CoTH past him.  There is no safe place to do that.  You can not run past him invis, he will see you.  Good CoV faction will not get you in past him.  NToV stuff is kos to everyone.<br>
<br>
I don't care for lengthy rotations either.  They suck.  I agree with everyone on that.  However, sometimes there needs to be order and respect, and if a rotation assists that end, then so be it.  In the case of NToV, there are only 4 guilds in there right now who can kill Aaryonar, and have demenstrated that by doing so.  Yes, the stuff in North is a week spawn time, longer than Trak or VS.  However, even if it were ffa, it would still be a week spawn, you cant change that.  When Affliction started killing in north, we were the only guild there, that is true.  Not more than a couple weeks later, KX killed Aary for the first time.  The two guilds came to an agreement about the spawns that worked well for both guilds.  Shortly after, DG offed Aary and entered NToV.  At this point, KX decided that they did not want to have to wait an extra week for the shot at north, and that is when these problems started.<br>
<br>
Then, a couple of smaller guilds, who want to be in NToV, but who could not kill Aary, started going in behind the guilds who could and attempting to kill named, after one of the other guilds had killed Aary.  Now, I am not bashing or flaming here at all so dont take it that way.  RoD proved the day after this happened, that they could indeed kill Aary, and kudos to them for a job well done.  But I agree with Breus in that they should never have killed Dagarn untill they had killed Aary.  The other guild in question, just pretty much walked in, yes, they had to kill some drakes and some flurry drakes, but um, comparatively speaking, that is easy, so, so what?  Killing some drakes and walking to PoM with out killing even one single named, is just wrong.  This does not, in any way, make you 'capable of killing in NToV' all it does is say that you can kill normal West or HoT stuff.  And not to belittle the guilds who farm there, but, um, so what?  <br>
<br>
What is the big deal about getting a full spawn every month anyway?  I would rather know that once a month, I get to go in, have all the named up at once, and kill them all.  This is much better than ffa, and going in to find that a guild farmed the hell out of one or two dragons and left the rest up because they did not need that loot anymore.  I mean, how many times can you only kill, for expample, Dagarn and Lord Koi 'Doken(sp) ?  before you no longer need those two dragons loot tables.  It is sooo much easier to just go in and get what you need.  And eventually, the guilds doing North, will be done, just like Magi and MF were done, and the up and coming guilds will have it to themselves.<br>
<br>
And lastly, again, not the opionion of my guild, even though some may agree with me on this.  This matter should be taken care of in a polite, adult and honorable manner between the officers of the 4 guilds involved.  It should really not be here on this board at all.  AND, IF YOU ARE NOT INVOLVED, OR NOT A MEMBER OF SAID 4 GUILDS INVOLVED, AND HAVE NOT KILLED AARYONAR OR ARE NOT EVEN REMOTELY ABLE TO EVEN THINK ABOUT ATTEMPTING AARYONAR, KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT!  YOU HAVE NO BUSINESS EVEN STICKING YOUR NOSE IN TO THE TOPIC AT ALL!  Alll you are doing is stiring the pot.  If you are that bored, go get a life or something.  Stay out of it, let it be handles by those who have business there in the first place.<br>

<br>
I still do hope that something can be worked out.  By this point in the game almost all players in high end guilds have friends/ex-guildmates in other high end guilds.   When two guilds fight it puts a lot of stress on guild officers trying to work something out, as well as people that have friends in the other guild.<br>
<br>
Even if rotations aren't the answer, talking about the situation will hopefully come to some sort of agreement on the situation.<br>

<br>
US players in the Lower Teir Guilds of ToV Guilds can take some lessons from the Euro / Asian Guilds and higher Teir Guilds.<br>
  I am quite honestly appalled by the lack of sportsmanship exhibited by both RoD and KX. They are obviously the reason why this post was started. First punch was RoD against KX. Night before the patch last week RoD ran in ToV and decided to cherrypick DoD. That was totally uncool and gave KX the mentality of eye for a eye. <br>
  RoD should have totally ignored that DoD and company were up and open based on their choice of complaint on the subsequent days. Was DoD KX's? I dont know but it most certainly wasnt RoDs. Calling foul the following day was a cheap and very uncool. If you are going to live by a principle please lead by example and not vengance. <br>
  KX I thought you all were bigger and alot more mature then the way you are. Hearing you all request a camp on a mob so that another guild cant have then since you camp a group in his lair waiting for people to log on to do him. Yelinak comes to mind not only once but several times DG has honored your claims on a camp and not run over you to do a mob. Yet you set your bar on the honor scale lower then even RoD. I have no pity for you and would vote to run over you every time now in the future passed on your lack of respect and honor towards other guilds. <br>
   Of course my veiw point isnt that of my guild but knowing how you all opperate now shows me exactly how much trust you deserve. <br>
   RoD fer shame grow up do Aary again live learn and lead. Dont try to dupe the duppers (KX) at their own game and play honorably and perhaps other guilds wont trash on you like KX did. <br>

Aayronar a monster? Well this is how we used to kill him.<br>
Hide all your casters around a corner, have melees in the hall leading to Aarys lair, pull him. enc tash shaman malo. shaman cast slow.<br>
<br>
Aayronar has an AE that sieves mana. casters were safe around the corner, and make sure they click a right click item to refresh their mana bars. <br>
<br>
I heard he is tied to the guards now and has more HP? well his guards are slowable too. Just a little practice and you can get him. Or just  CoH to Lord Kois pond and skip the whole shebang<br>

<br>
On Tuesday night we decided to learn more about NToV, by just going in and doing a dry run.  Nothing was up at this point.  At about 1-1.30 AM EST Dagarn spawned, given that a patch was comming in a few hrs we decided to kill him.  We killed him about an hour before servers came down for the patch, ironically Aaryonar spawned just as we were leaving as well.  <br>
<br>
On Wednesday afternoon we decided to try Aaryonar.  Both RoD and KX were setting up when we came to an agreement to prevent any hostilities.  We rolled for NToV, RoD won, KX left the zone for other endevours.  Wednesday night RoD killed Ikitar, Eashen, Aaryonar, Lord Feshlak and we camped out due to the late hour.<br>
<br>
This brings us to Thursday afternoon, where RoD is awaiting people to arrive in ToV when KX comes in anon.  Its quite funny watching a guild come into a zone all anon.  We both ended up CoTH'ing into NToV, RoD goes right and proceeds to kill Lord Kriezenn, KX goes left and killes Lord Koi and Lady Mir.  RoD gets to the triplets, clears the area and KX runs by towards Lady Nev and Jorlleag.  At this point tensions are high and we come to an agreement that RoD will take Lady nev/Jorlleag and KX will take the triplets.<br>
<br>
Without a rotation, this will continue to occur.  One guild clears Aaryonar and a number of other guilds move in to kill the other dragons, while you are already there.  To put it into perspective it would be like killing Vindi to clear way for the statue just to have someone pull the statue as you are engaged with vindi, one could argue that they are 2 different mobs and killing one doesnt give you claim on the other. <br>
<br>
The solution can be simple, clear out NToV in one sweep, where there will be no argument over spawns, or come to an agreement where if you kill Aaryonar everyone respects your claim to the other dragons. Going FFA would mean that guilds that can kill Aaryonar would be in NToV till they dont need anything anymore and they move on, it would also mean that other guilds that cannot kill Aaryonar will have access to the other dragons. <br>
<br>
What is it going to be ? <br>

<br>
Thing is, you didn't do it in one sweep. What if it took 3, 4 even 5 days for a guild to clear NToV? I'm not saying that RoD would take 5 days but how would guilds that do it in one sweep feel if some guild killed 1 or 2 dragons and said &quot;oh we'll get the rest later this week&quot;? This is just one more problem with any type of rotation.<br>
<br>
As it was and still is, you go into NToV and kill as much mobs as you can / are up. If you come back the next day, there is no 100 percent guarantee that everyone has left the mobs you didn't kill alone.<br>

I'm not trying to be an ass, but attempting to add a bit of perspective. Yes, NToV is different...but why should it be different in "that" sort of way?...because someone said it had to be? <br>
<br>
What I see is the upper-level game getting so crowded that when Aary pops, he'll be dead in 10 minutes...and folks will be perma-camping NToV dragon spawns and killing flurry drakes for exp! (well, not really)<br>

Anyway, what makes me post now is to clear one simple fact up.  Kx NEVER went into a rotation for ntov with affliction, dg, and mf.  kx went into a rotation with affliction and affliction only.  why we pulled out has absolutely NOTHING to do with any other guild.  we had no problems with dg, mf, rod, or any other guild who you may think were involved.  <br>

if you would like to know why we pulled out, i will be happy to share with you in tells.  I'm not going to start another flame fest because i'm sure what i have to say will certainly get under many people's skins.  there are so many myths out there that it's impossible for any actual truths to be believed anymore. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uzelgreyweather.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Zel Greyweather</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 322<br> <font color=#E9D756>(7/24/02 2:57:38 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrgeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=10175.topic&index=51>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: !</span><hr size=1> The results of Forced Rotations on Stormhammer...<br>

<br>
I do not want to turn this into another flame thread but you sir are wrong.<br>
<br>
First off, Bareba never did have aggro and came back to our camp without feigning while you were getting wiped out, which means that whatever killed you would have came for us next if you in fact were trained. Since nothing came - whatever happened to you is your fault alone, don't blame it on RoD. Also RoD decided not to sink to the level of name calling and training from get go and the only people talking about training were your guild's monks, and I do have logs of that saved.<br>
<br>
Secondly, yes you did coth to north when RoD had 19 people, and KX had about the same number of people at the time, so what is your point? The only reason we did not coth first was because we were waiting on officers to resolve the situation with KX as adults. When it became apparent that your officers refused to discuss things and instead decided to make a race out of it, then we cothed in as well and started clearing while KX was buffing or whatever.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I hope this whoile argument helps to bring some kind of agreement between all involved guilds about how NTov is to be handled in the future. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=44043" border="0">

Whatever hopes you may have of a rotation for NToV are already doomed.<br>
<br>
This is far more complicated than Trak/VS.<br>
<br>
Too many mobs, too long of a spawn time, too many guilds at varying levels of capability, too many guilds period, no one has mentioned Vulak - how does he measure in, what about guilds that are done and dont want/care to wait for a rotation, what about skipped dragons, it takes some guilds 1 day and others 5 days..... those are just the simple ones.<br>
<br>
I don't speak for my guild.  But, I do know many of us like to return to NToV for a bit of nostalgia... and hell we owe VI a couple Vulak beatings for taking him out of commission for so long.<br>
<br>
I've long been a fan of rotations but I just dont see it feasible in this situation.<br>

First of all- the idea of rotations appalls me. This implies only the elite few can go after specific mobs. For smaller guilds this limits the ability to recruit certain classes as they are not in any rotations. In effect, the rich and powerful guilds get more rich and more powerful and all the other guilds simply have to struggle to get to these levels. It is, in effect, an elitest system.<br>
As for posting this suggestion on this board; It seems to me that working out these differences in the game or between the guild leaders or officer councils or whatever structure there is would make more sense then posting here. If you have to post this thread here it appears to others that your ability to play fair and work with others is suffering. It does not reflect well on your guild, and that is a shame, as many of these guilds are decent. <br>
Also a reminder- The rest of us players in Everquest should ALWAYS be considered when guilds make decisions to limit our ability to play. My guess is that 95% or more of players on this server do not belong to some of these &quot;rotation&quot; guilds. If there are rotations the idea of always keeping one or two open spots in it are a necessity.<br>

<br>
I would argue that rotations can help protect the interests of smaller guilds.<br>
<br>
Let's take VS for example.  For many guilds, this is a laughable, trivial encounter that can be accomplished in less than 30 minutes from the time he is first identified as up until the time a guildmember loots BS_legs82 for twink/sale.<br>
<br>
For other guilds, it takes a lot of preparation and ensuring that the right mix of classes is online. <br>
<br>
Now, if you are in a small guild and its your turn in the rotation, you can PLAN on killing VS on a certain day, arrange a time that's the most beneficial to your guild.  You don't have to worry about racing a guild to the spawn, you don't have to worry about a guild pulling over you while you're buffing and you don't have to worry about logging in 30 people 8 hours before VS is due to hold the spawn.<br>
<br>
I'm not going to say whether or not I support rotations, but saying that rotations only cater to the elite is bogus.  <br>
<br>
The truely elite don't need rotations because of their incredible skills of organization and mobilization.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/bemarr.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=thronidor>Thronidor</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 30<br> <font color=#E9D756>(7/24/02 7:41:09 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrgeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=10175.topic&index=56>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: rotations</span><hr size=1> I have stayed quiet til now but Xisix your total lack of understanding and anything concerning rationale and true thought makes me sick.<br>

RoD rolled on Thursday against Kx to get the right to take on Aaaryonar.... Guild Leader Berit and Yaraa for KX rolled Berit from RoD rolled first he got an 82 out of random 100. Yaraa rolled a 44 from memory. Kx left and went to ssra and we went on to kill  Ikitair, Eashen, Aary and one other forgive me if i dont recall but i have plenty other things going besides eq to worry about.... Had KX won that roll we would have respected there claim to the entire NTov spawn not play bs games the next day.<br>
<br>
Friday Dg went into ToV saw the Ntov mobs up and sent a tell to us that they would respect the fact we killed aary and not proceed into Ntov if we would respect there right also after clearing Aary,,,We agreed as it was precendent....<br>
<br>
Once they agreed we did not hurry to rush are people there as we felt it would be respected (obviously we were wrong)..<br>
<br>
Fact is KX Coth past us as we were trying to work it out with them. We have not now nor ever been a guild to intentionally run over others simple fact. Once we realised that nothing we said was going to work we CoTh our people also and infact killed a named dragon before KX killed Lord Koi....<br>
<br>
So Tyvalius pull your head our of your A$$ and Birren I think your last name should be A$$kisser as your obviously a Kx flunky. <br>
<br>
WE killed Aaary first night WE killed the first named dragon in NToV on Friday our second day and would have killed all of them had KX not decided to intrude on us.... Get your fact straight before you start licking someone's a$$. It disgusts me all the emarr loot whores jump on the wagon knowing jack and $hit about what actually happened.....At no time did we intentionaly train them nor did they ever have more then us we both had 50ish at any given time. Tho i find it funny you guys (or the mysterious stranger) started RoV.....<br>
<br>
Will this change anything probably not. We did venture into NToV but was to learn pull routes etc and not to work on someone elses victory over Aary. Dagarn was a last minute target of opportunity simple as that, as it cost no one anything as was hours from a patch....<br>
<br>
Now for some interesting light on a few things Meagan you clain that KX intered the Rotation that was with Afflic only and thats fine but the day you guys (KX) wanted to do that RoD had equal number of people in there as you AND we where poised to start the pulls from NToV( you guys where at zone yet) and your guildleader Mackentil assured us that they would respect RoD chance next time full spawn came, and as i recall you didnt kill him the first time it took several attempts over two days.... Not only that when you did kill aary you had rest of the week no one ventured inot NToV as we felt we had an agreement....<br>
<br>
Secondly as far as respect goes we had a issue with Klandicar i had plenty of people there 20 plus(more in sg on the way) you had a few Stolyn whom i have alot of respect for asked ME to back RoD off so that KX could try him for the first time.... Guess what i did as asked him and you guys killed Klandi..... So i can think of two times we respected your claim and when time came to repay that courtesy your true colors came out.... Stolyn i have nothing but respect for you  thats a fact you have always been straight up.... Mackentil all i can say is you reap what you sow the misinformation game your playing with your members will come to a head and guess what you hurt yourself more then you hurt RoD that day.....<br>
<br>
You may have killed one more dragons then us but we where in no hurry and KX ran past us to start killing the Tripplets after we cleared to them so while you may have gotten a few more drops items i think in the long run you hurt you image far more than anything your or your clones might think to hurt ours with your feeble attempts at justification on the boards here. The people who know and respect the effort of others in NToV already know about this incident and will judge for themselves your actions....<br>
<br>
Bottom line you want ffa in NToV thats fine tho RoD would recognize a rotation as it serves all of our best interests dont think for a minute that we cannot mobilize quickly when we have to as can Mag Mf Dg Affliction and a few others.... PLay your games you might beat us but the chances of you beating us all is slim and none. Rotations while sucking and I am not a fan of them have there purposes. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/bemarr.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=thronidor>Thronidor</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 31<br> <font color=#E9D756>(7/24/02 7:50:06 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrgeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=10175.topic&index=57>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: rotations</span><hr size=1> addendum: as far as Bareba intentionally training anyone Xisix grow up i gaurantee she is far more believeable then you or anyone else in your guild so you want to rant and try to portray us as lootwhore a$$holes go for it i can rebut anything a small mind like your can comprehend easily....<br>

<br>
RoD claimed repeatedly that she was pulling.  <br>
<br>
K'X was sitting just under Ledge in aary pit.  From that point it is not possible to get back over the ledge.  Included in this misterious train were 5 hatclings. Which only spawn from back above the ledge.  SO... someone had to have come from up there.  Seeing as how K'X had already been down in the pit a while and had pulled and killed a couple flurry drakes ...it wasn't a bad pull on the part of K'X.  <br>
<br>
RoD was sitting in Lord Fesh's lair when the train hit.  K'X had just pulled 2 mobs from the opposite direction of the inc train.  Bareba is then seen in the K'X camp.  Then the train hits.  For no reason ever should a monk from a different guild, uninvited, be in a different guild's camp...especially while they are engaging multiple mobs.   <br>
<br>
RoD officer claim she was pulling.  Well since they were past aary pit there is only one of two ways for an RoD monk to get in that position: 1) she was Decessioned to the zone where she ran all the way back through the hub, wyverns, and hatchlings to the ledge, or 2) she joined the raid late and ran all the way through.  <br>
<br>
RoD's officers claim it was an accidental pull proves that she did indeed come from above the ledge.  the distance she had to run to get there proves she had to have wanted to pull those mobs very, very badly.  NO guild that has ever done NToV would believe for a split second that you would try to pull hatchlings after you were already in Fesh's lair.<br>
<br>
So she made a marathon run from the zone in.  She &quot;pulled&quot; 7 mobs, supposedly for RoD to kill.  All 7 mobs happen to path through K'X camp while they are engaged with 2 mobs.  K'X has a near complete wipe out.  RoD claims it was a bad pull.  Shockingly RoD doesn't offer to help K'X recover from there accidental pull through the K'X camp.  A few minutes later an RoD member tells a K'X officer it was malicious.  <br>
<br>
Even without that tell.  No guild experienced in NToV would for a second believe that a monk ran from zone in all the way through hub, wyvens, and hatchlings to pull some mobs for a guild camped in lord fesh's lair.  <br>
<br>
But perhaps the biggest condemning fact.  The night RoD and K'X rolled for north, Berit told K'X officers that if K'X broke the agreement and tried to move in while RoD was in North, RoD would train them.  <br>
<br>
Bareba was seen in camp.  40+ K'X can varify that.  By saying it was an accidental bad pull RoD varified that she was there.  Pure logistics prove there is easy no way to get to where she was pulling from.  Experience proves there is no reason in hell for a raid to pull from that far behind them.  Threats from RoD guildleader foreshadowed the train.  RoD member admits it.  <br>
<br>
What else is there to discuss?<br>

Without Facts one can easily say that you overpulled and wiped out because of it and used Bareba's proximity as a crutch to lay blame.

<br>
Dignity really has nothing to do with this. If it's FFA, it's FFA. You can't have FFA and apply the KAYGATZ (Kill Aary & You Get All The Zone) rule.<br>
<br>
We've killed Aary in the past and left mobs up...and someone else came in and cleaned up in the middle of the night. We really didn't complain because we recognize that the zone is FFA.<br>
<br>
The point is...if there is going to be a rotation, every guild that intends to hunt there or quest there must abide by it. Since this will never happen, the rotation is just a pipe dream.<br>
