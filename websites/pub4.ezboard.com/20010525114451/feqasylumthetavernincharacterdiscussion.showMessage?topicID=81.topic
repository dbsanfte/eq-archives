===============<br>
<br>
There had been a eerie silence about the streets of Felwithe for over two weeks now. No-one knew who would return to greet their families, and those who would never set foot on blessed Fawdyer again. But today it was passed in whispers about the city, the stout paladins of the King's Guard would return home. Defeated they may have been, but their honour was held high, the forces ranged against them far superior in number, it had been too much even for such knights of valour as they.<br>
<br>
The young temple acolyte was all nerves, waiting to greet her father, who she had not seen for over a year. She was hardly out of childhood, but already had the bearing of one much older, and yet this day, found her studies impossible to keep her mind upon. There had been rumours, of course, of great losses, and stories of bravery and fortitude in the face of a powerful alliance of enemies, but Felishanna was excited, her beloved father would be soon arriving home. How she had missed him.<br>
<br>
The acolyte slipped out of the temple when her tutor was distracted, and headed to the city gates. The streets had become quieter that morning, but she was soon to see why. Most of the elders of the city had already processed to the gates, followed by a large crowd, mostly of women, eager to greet their loved ones home. Felishanna espied her mother, and the other ladies of the Queen's Court, and the Royal Knights standing guard, but she could not approach them, she knew, she should not even be here.<br>
<br>
Then the rider came.<br>
<br>
A single horse, ridden by a tall high elf in silver platemail, sword sheathed by his side, shield on his back. Felishanna had to look from afar as he dismounted, and then lost sight of him behind the crowd, but something must have happened, as the crowd groaned as he disappeared from her sight.<br>
<br>
Felishanna was not going to let it go at that. She looked around, and saw a market stall nearby, left unattended by its keeper, obviously he too had been drawn by the crowd. She circled the stall and then, without second thought, clambered up the side and stood up on its rather flimsy roof. It could easily have collapsed under her weight, but it did not, and from the elevated position she now had a much clearer view.<br>
<br>
The knight was kneeling before the Queen, and speaking to her, and to the General Seneschal, who stood beside her. Felishanna could no longer see her mother in the Queen's retinue, but she knew that she must be closeby. The crowd, which had been chattering excitedly, grew quieter, in expectation of news. The main host would be back soon, they would hear.<br>
<br>
The words of the knight could not of course be heard, and after a few quiet minutes, he stood once more. Then, Felishanna could see, even from her distance, that he was injured, probably quite badly. Two of the royal guards were assigned to assist the knight in leaving the Queen's presence. The crowd began to chatter once more.<br>
<br>
A single trumpet was sounded. The Seneschal climbed on to a makeshift platform, and made ready to address the people of Felwithe. The Queen stood beside him, an unreadable look on her face.<br>
<br>
&quot;Citizens of Felwithe, the war in Tunaria is over. There is little more we can do to fight against the forces our enemies have fielded against us in the deserts of Ro. The withdrawal, authorized but three days ago, was completed this very day. A large host of our Tunarean brothers and sisters have been rescued, and we have brought them with us back to our beloved lands. Her sweet majesty, the Queen, has spoken, that all those saved from the evil on Tunaria shall be taken and cared for, until such a time as they can build new lives for themselves under our protection.&quot;<br>
<br>
The Seneschal paused and glanced at the Queen. His posture changed, he looked, almost frightened.<br>
<br>
&quot;I have terrible tidings also. I must speak them, not them them reach your ears in a wave of whispers&quot;. He paused. &quot;There is no easy way to say what I must, but it must be said. One battalion of the King's Royal Guard, stationed in the barracks over yonder, will be remembered always as heroes of our realm, for giving their lives, every last man, to save many many more.&quot;<br>
<br>
There was total silence. The crowd looked frozen in shock. The usually proud and staunch faces looked shocked, horrified even. Felishanna could see tears in many eyes. How awful. So many must have died. Her father would tell her the story, when he got here. So many of these poor people, her family, her friends, those she served and those she passed each day, would cry and mourn this night, and many nights, for this tragedy.<br>
<br>
&quot;That is all the news I have for now. The King's captains will arrive shortly, to report, and I will send messengers throughout the city, with updates as I have them. Be strong, my friends. Many of Tunare's chosen were saved this day, and the Sweet Lady will take to her breast the fallen, and they will be as honoured guests at her table&quot;.<br>
<br>
The Seneschal stood down, and the Royal Party moved quietly away. Felishanna waited and watched, as some of the crowd went back to their dayly business, but the larger part remained near the gates, waiting for more news.<br>
<br>
Time passed, and Felishanna grew a little bored. Where are they, she thought. But she had a while longer to wait yet.<br>
<br>
Finally, as the sun reached its noonday point, a group of riders entered the city. The King's Captains!!! Yes, her father would be among them. She counted them as they came in ... yes ... six of them. Hmm .. there are supposed to be seven, perhaps one is delayed. She looked to pick out her father among them, but from this distance, the armoured knights looked very alike. As they climbed down from their horses, Ladies of the Court welcomed them, the wives and families they had not seen in so long. Bah, she thought, why must temple duties forbid me to be by my mother's side today.<br>
<br>
Then Felishanna espied her mother once more. She was stood with her Lady in Waiting towards the rear, and had not moved forward when the other ladies had, she had remained unmoved. One silver-clad Captain, who had only just greeted his own wife, then slowly walked over to Felishanna's mother and knelt before her. He held in his hands, Felishanna could see it clearly though it was a far away, a silver helm, but not his own, which he still wore. Puzzled, Felishanna watched as the Captain spoke to her mother, and handed her the helm. Then she saw her mother collapse.<br>
<br>
&quot;Mother?!!&quot; she cried out, involuntarily, and before she knew it she was pushing her way through the now loosely gathered crowd. One Captain espied her and held out his arms toward her, as if to guard her off, but Felishanna dodged him easily, his attempt was half-hearted at best. And so, she quickly reached her fallen mother's side.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ahh ... young Felishanna, you have changed yet more since your Father and I left these shores. He would be proud of his daughter, if he could see you now.&quot; He had tears in his eyes as he spoke, but he held his voice calm. &quot;Take care of your mother, young priestess, she will need you now, until your brothers return home tomorrow with the main host.&quot;<br>
<br>
He started to walk away, then paused. &quot;Know this, Felishanna. Your father died a hero's death, with all his men, so that a thousand souls might live this day. Be proud of him, young one, grieve your family will, but know he would have had it no other way, than to save another.&quot; A single tear rolled down his face, as he turned back to his waiting wife.<br>
<br>
&quot;NOOOOOOOO !!!!!!&quot; Felishanna cried, as she held her fainted mother in her arms.</font><P>------------------------------<BR>
