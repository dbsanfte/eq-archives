First off, an apology to Grudgebringer, I did come off as overly aggressive, and that was uncalled for.  But, you do seem to be condoning his actions by consoling him and by your choice of words in describing the Chosen Counsel's actions.<br>
<br>
Now, as to your points, Counselor.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> RPG - What makes it fun is there really are no rules<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Now, I realize that you're not referring to the overall game mechanics (referred to as &quot;frame rules&quot; hereafter), such as using <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> x</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> amount of dice to resolve situation <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> y</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.  But most RPGs do have a morality system embedded therein.  In D&amp;D, it is the alignment system.  In the Storyteller system, there are a variety, depending on the game (Humanity, Renown, Paradox, Shadow, Banality, etc.).  These rules are as important as the frame rules because they govern many other aspects (in D&amp;D they affect experience, weapon use, class selection, etc.).  My point is that most of the better RPGs give rewards for being &quot;good&quot; and penalties for being &quot;evil.&quot;  Please don't anyone respond with the varied &quot;paths&quot; in the Vampire game, those, as I see it, are primarily in place to allow the villains a fighting chance against the heroes who likely have a much higher Humanity (and so are able to stay awake longer, roll more dice in certain important circumstances, etc.).  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Thievery is a good part of every RPG and is the basis of a normal Rogue (of course pussified version exists in EQ) <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Agreed, all good RPGs have thieves and thief-like characters.  However, these are included for the purposes of being inclusive for the most part.  Most people play the &quot;heroic thief&quot; much like Robin Hood or Bilbo Baggins (those two being, I believe the most famous two).  Due to their criminal abilities, though, they must always deal with the social stigmata of being a lawbreaker.  Most PC thieves work very hard to counter that by not stealing from &quot;good&quot; people and only harassing those considered &quot;evil.&quot;  The EQ version is no more or less than it is in most fantasy RPGs, barring the inability to practice their craft on other players, which is a concession to the game itself.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Luminescence was simply playing a role he finds enjoyable and EQ GMs are pretty anal about any wrong play, but they do not get involved in this (there is a good reason why). <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Actually, he <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> wasn't</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> playing a role, at least not the entire time.  He was simply being greedy.  I don't believe at any point did he say he was role-playing.  Plus, it's obvious that he is a rules lawyer the way he was checking his own back when called on it, and rules-lawyers are, by definition not role-players.  As far as the GMs getting involved, their hands are tied as far as certain situations.  While they may not like it, they have no legal right to use their GM powers to disrupt the game unless it is a direct violation of their procedures.  It would otherwise be easy to call GMs on favoritism and abuse.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> To have a world of peace is boring.  Confrontation and differences are what make the game so diverse and great <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Actually, this is quite true.  But this is why they have NPCs, monsters, quests, and ultimately the PVP servers.  You can have these elements without PVP if you have good roleplayers, I might add.<br>
<br>
You refer to the Dagerfall game; Daggerfall is a fantastic game, but it is at least one thing that EQ is not -- single player.  Because this is a multi-player game, you have to consider something that you cannot script, that something being the actions and feelings of more than one person given circumstances and the interaction between people.  In Daggerfall, you really don't have a KS problem.  Nor do you have trade problems.  There is a more realistic consequence from doing &quot;evil&quot; in your faction with the townsfolk.  In fact, you can act any way you want because the story is all about YOU and what you do with a given situation.  There is no danger of you annoying (or worse) anyone else.<br>
<br>
In EQ, we cannot have that sort of focus.  In order to please the maximum amount of people, you have to make it relatively safe for the most part (as evidence, I show you the comparitive amount of PVP and non PVP characters, much less severs).  This means that the people who wish to do &quot;evil&quot; (or play at &quot;evil&quot; for that matter) must be curbed in the interests of the greater good of the community.<br>
<br>
In fact, if you want to use RL RPG games such as D&amp;D, it takes a very very mature group of players who know each other to pull off the &quot;character who screws others over.&quot;  Otherwise, personal feelings almost always get in the way as one player snidely trumps over others.  This sort of degenerative behavior (speaking of the degeneration of a group, rather than in the sense the the person is a degenerate) will destroy a gaming group, and can put a strain even on well-formed groups.<br>
<br>
If you turn to literature, the genre is definitely slanted toward the &quot;good.&quot;  Most characters in literature are good in the sense that they do things for people (rather than against them) when possible and try not to do ill to anyone (except the obvious villains).  Most people are most comfortable with this sort of framework, i.e. good vs evil, with good winning out in the end.  Most stories do not feature an evil thief who commits evil acts throughout and does not pay for his crimes at the end.  Call it childish if you will, but the happy ending is the goal of most people.<br>
<br>
The serious emotions people are feeling over this situation have very little to do with a series of pixels or strings of coding.  It is over the behavior that was shown by the culprit, Luminesence, in the entire manner.  He didn't steal because he needed, he stole because he wanted to.  He acted petty and superior, showing a complete disregard for anyone else's feelings.  That's what all the hard feeling is about.<br>
<br>
Value is a very subjective concept, and simply because the object has imaginary properties does not make it (necessarily) any less valuable.  Most of the participants involved do not consider the item itself to be all that valuable.  In fact, an argument could be made that Lumi himself is the one with the unusal value system.  After all, it is his initial action and his following attitude that caused all this.  When given the choice between repayment of an ephemeral string of coding or harassment for a poor attitude, he chose to be harassed.  He chose poorly, then.<br>
<br>
In final analysis: these are the feelings that people would normally repress in real life were they dealing with a similar person with Lumi's sort of attitude.  This is actually quite healthy.<br>
<br>
I understand your points on EQ, the Rogue, and evil classes, but I think your premise is faulty.  Most people engage in EQ (and most games) because they have fun doing it.  Most people wouldn't find getting ripped off in game or killed by other players (like on the PVP server) fun.  Rather, they would find it frustrating.  I think that the Rogue class in EQ is quite good for the genre it is emulating.  For those who do enjoy it, that is why there are the PVP servers.<br>
<br>
I would also like add at this point that your venomous attack on Stasia was far far over the line, and completely uncalled for.  You were, in essence, asking for someone to do that by claiming superior intelligence and failing to correctly spell and use proper grammar.  Again, I understand why you did it, but I found your &quot;turnabout&quot; to be beyond the boundaries of good taste.  Please curb these tendencies in the future, or find a different way to express them. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uplurlanys.showPublicProfile?language=EN>PlurLanys</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I live here.... get out.</span><br> <font color=#000033>(7/18/01 5:47:31 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=Illegal WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Reply to Counselor</span><hr size=1> why bother arguing with him? he posts himself on the honor board as an anonymous name and defends the shit list with out of the line comments. not worth it. <p>Illegal javascript event tags or url parameters detected.</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ushoumai.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Shoumai</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>p0\/\/3r-p0sT3r!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(7/19/01 1:11:26 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Luminescence.

<br>
How is it roleplaying when these chickenshit assholes act like dicks and then hide behind the 'blue server' ruleset to protect them from retribution?  Even on a PvP server, you are protected to a certain extent.  If I rip off Uber the 60th level superwizard, I am protected from any harm if I am below his level range of PvP, on his team, etc.  Even on Sullon, which has the nastiest set of rules for PvP, a 60th couldn't even cause exp loss to a level 1 or recover whatever was stolen from his dead body.  <br>
<br>
So can someone please explain how this is roleplaying?   Please?<br>
<br>

Troll Thief and Liar.</span><hr size=1> Good god...Shut up!  I never said I was roleplaying.  What I was doing was stealing an item from another player, not for the enjoyment of stealing, or to roleplay a theif, but to make my character stronger.  Haven't you ever heard of a &quot;Power Gamer&quot;?  That's me, only I do it the easy way.<br>
<br>
Somewhere up there I saw some dork stole a fungi tunic from some guy and got banned for it.  Well, there's always been rules in place to do that, you just have to use the report function.  But as for taking the item, I doubt that's what he got nailed on.<br>
<br>
And that Kilj guy said I must be a rules-lawyer to be able to dodge all of the &quot;formal bullets&quot;, but actually, I pretty much got lucky.  It was quite a rush, actually.  But I escaped unscathed and now I'm plus one wyrmslayer.  Now, had Worthy or any of those rejects been able to report me, I'd have been screwed...except for the fact that I told the GM myself that I did it.  You really have to read all of the posts in the first four, or so clusters, or you really have no idea what is going on.  Everything past that is bullshit because people can't control their pathetic tears and worthless insults on me.<br>
<br>
Last point I need to make is, Counselor is not me.  He may be some other guy, but I really don't care.  Could be one of you flamers hiding behind a mask so they don't spoil their flaming image.  Though I doubt he's smarter than I am, he takes more time to throw his posts together, so they seem a bit more inteligent.  Also, Kilj, you're a blowhard.  It's not hard to sit down for an entire day and write 20 paragraphs of garbage that I stopped reading at paragraph two when your point was made and the rant began.<br>
<br>
As for the rest of you, get a fuckin' life.  I haven't even played on Lanys in a long while.  You don't need to worry about the master anymore.  He won't take anything else from you losers.<br>

Would anyone here still be friends with a person who stole from an innocent person for no reason?  From what I can interpret Lumi seems to be trying to regain some dignity (example - he said he never said he enjoyed seeing people suffer, etc., but this would clearly indicate that he doesn't want to be seen as a total ass), but his logic doesn't work very well.  If your friend stole the item it isn't his, so you can return it without too much grief over &quot;taking&quot; your friend's item and giving it back to the owner right? <br>

Heh...you think that I will just go away when you stop talking?  That's incorrect.  I'm here to post my opinion just like all of the rest of you cretins.  So, unless the moderators dig up a reason to ban me, I'm here to stay.

Troll Thief and Liar.</span><hr size=1> I'll just tell you one thing bitch. <br>
<br>
Check it out; everyone in-agme couldn't give 2 shits aobut you anymore. I mean, you wasted all that time leveling your character. When you realized no one liked oyu, you re-started. Just think about it, hat have you accomplished, exactly. You've trashed your primary to no end. You've got no friends (except maybe people that you get to speak up for you, or low-lives as bad as you). And for what; a Wurmy. BWAHAHAH! do you realize that if you had been even at all self-respecting and honorable, you could have gotten into a guild; maybe a guild that would twink you up very nicely. All this, and you don't get your name posted here.<br>
<br>
But, you choose ot take the item like a little bitch. Now, you already see that no one respects your opinion. You're flamed everywhere you post. And remember, moderators can track I{ addresses. So, that Sn you develop later will be revealed soon enough. Just know this, if you ever wanna do good raids, in high-lvl dungeons or areas, you'll need certain things:<br>
<br>
1) Friends (most important; this one will be hard for you)<br>
2) Support of Community (you doin't have it, you won't have it)<br>
3) Guild 9not always necessary, but not a bad idea. Also something you don't have).<br>
<br>
The fact of the matter is this. If you even do manage to level your character past lvl 35 (I sincerely doubt you will); you'll soon find out that you'd need a group th hunt with. Of course, since your alt will eventually be revealed, grouping for you would be hard. Since you're a warrior, you can't solo either. YOu can forget about joining guilds or raids, cuz you know you're not getting into any. <br>
<br>
So, yea, you can restart and play another warrior. Go ahead; but the same thing will happend then too. And I'm betting you'll get quite bored of repeating teh whole leveling process. So, you'll wind up havin allyour characters below lvl 35, and tyou will quit the game; because at some point, it just gets bored to keep lvling a class from lower ranks over and over. <br>
<br>
So, you wind up quitting EQ. Now, what have you gained then? well, you've wasted a whole lot of time making a bunch of useless meleers. You have no friends. You've never been on any good raids. But, you're speding just as much time on EQ as they are. So basically; for you it's all work and no reward with your characters. Your only gain from this; that stupid Wurnslayer. Believe me, judging by your obvious low intelligence level, you'll soon be trying to utter curses at that weapon from your screen. <br>
<br>
And just think. all of this, for a measly pixel. Maybe even you acn figure out tha it's just not worth it.  <p><center><img src="http://twols.homestead.com/files/wilsig.jpg"></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/beqasylum.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=luminescence>Luminescence</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>w4nn4b3!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(7/20/01 10:26:36 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Luminescence.

<br>
My primary...yeah right, like I'd do something like this with my primary.  Lumi is not my primary you shit-for-brains.  There is no new character on Lanys, and no, you aren't all that you think you are.  If you were half as smart as you seem to think you are, you would have stopped repeating yourself by now and gotten on with your life.  Truth is, if I gave two shits, I COULD get a guild, I COULD get groups, I COULD get on good raids, but frankly, the fun is over.  Is it because of the shit people give me?  No.  It's because warriors are boring to play.<br>
<br>
And if you're really so concerned, who should I apologize to?  You?  Brashear?  The people I've flamed?  All of the people who flamed me?  Get real. <br>
