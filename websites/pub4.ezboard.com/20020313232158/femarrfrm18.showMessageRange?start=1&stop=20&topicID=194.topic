<br>
I only had to read the first page of the thread to figure out that democracy is still alive and well. <br>
<br>
Triff and Gladetree. Please take note that I do surely respect your opinion, well, beacuse frankly, your opinion does count. However, I wanted to take some time to vainly point out a couple things for you. Why? Oh, do tell. Well, I have met so many young men and women that just don't have a clue when it comes to a few things. (Not that you fall in this category, but you might.) A few things? History, geography, and the military. (You think all those dense people Jay Leno finds on the street are staged? Think again.)<br>
<br>
Triff points out that our country has changed a lot since it was founded and that he does not quite agree with these changes. News flash: it was designed that way. Read a history book or any half way creditable book on the thought process behind the founding of the US.<br>
<br>
The perfect government is one where the government governs no one and the people govern themselves. (Yeah, it famous. If you have not heard hit, again, pick up a book. Its about a 3000 year old statement.) However, until humanity reaches a point to where this becomes feasable, a government that governs to a point will have to suffice. Magic trick ..... democracy. About as close as we are going to get. So, this basicly means that since individuals are incapable of governing themselves as a general rule (read again, as a general rule) then we must have a body that governs us, but controlled by us. Magic trick #2 ..... majority rules. Yeah, it sucks when things don't go your way all the time. <br>
<br>
What's Qool's point? There comes a time when individuals most do things for the greater good of the whole. The word Team pops to mind. Which reminds me, speaking of YOUR war, you sure as hell cannot get an &quot;I&quot; out of Team, but I see your sure did find a way to create &quot;ME.&quot;<br>
<br>
Qool's an idiot, you must be thinking. Yeah, I know. Me and the countless millions of other idiots that have thought this way to make where you live, and how you live the way it is today.<br>
<br>
But it sucks here! you must be thinking from time to time. Feel free to step outside the blanket that you currently live under into another country and experience how the rest of the world does things. It will surely change your opinion.<br>
<br>
I always thought my elders were idiots as well. Their ideas and way of doing things was just idiotic. &quot;I surely could do better than that.&quot; This guy is stupid, what the hell is he doing?&quot; Well, over the years I have learned quit a bit. But at least I know enough now to know I sure as hell don't know everything, or anyting remotely close to it.<br>
<br>
Ah, but one thing I do know is the military, my dear Triff and Gladtree. To read your words amazes, but does not suprise, me at the level of your, and many others, ignorance regading the subject. If you think honestly to yourself, I hope you will find the ability that you do not have even a remote clue on that subject. As I am sure you have seen for yourself on occasions where you were the subject expert, seeing or hearing one speak so boldy and confident of a subject that they do not know is not only embarrasing, but sad. <br>
<br>
When put to the test, our nation and our people have accomplished feats that no one ever dared imagined. And its people like you that have to make that happen. I have peronally seen the resolve of our nation. I have shed blood, sweat, and tears with men from no-where towns in no-where USA. You would surely be amazed at what we can do. So, until that day my dear Triff and my dear Gladtree... until that fine day that you too can personly see and contribute to what with no question makes this the free nation that you so unknowing live under, please, oh please, STFU.<br>

They aren't the same.  I used to be a Randite, I'm not any more, I realize a lot of the places where it breaks down and so I don't use it to justify moral decisions.<br>
<br>
Secondly, I agree that the best form of government is total self-governing, and that the closest possible form of this is Democracy.  The problem is that this country is not a democracy, it's a republic, and what our armed forces do is literally a dictatorship.  This is by design for a quick response to military decisions.  <br>
<br>
Lastly, I will defend to the day I die my right to choose what I feel is the greater good.  You don't choose that for me, the government doesn't choose that for me, even if I agree with the government's basis since actual actions are often carried out by a small group of people.  <br>
<br>
A lot of this argument has been the forcing of an idea that to be an American you must pledge your loyalty to fight in a war blindly, no matter whether you like it or not.  My simple contention is that military decisions are going to be made by someone I didn't vote for, whom I have no confidence in to lead a successful campaign against these terrorists according to every reaction made thus far.  Whether or not my dissention matters to the government, you, or even myself is a question left up to practicality.  It shouldn't matter to you, it doesn't matter to the government at the momment, but if I myself ignore my dissention, based on my perception of the situation, then I'm wronging myself.  <br>
<br>
Of course, whether you agree or disagree with this is up to you.  Call me what you want, I'm sure it'll help you reduce some stress.<br>

Discussion!</span><hr size=1> Hrm... smoking is not the unifying act of humanity, rape is not part of the greatest expression of independence, emotions cannot be suborned to reason.  <br>
<br>
I admit, you can nudge your emotions, but not subborn, and because your emotions retain a certain independent freedom so must your moral decisions.  Logic and reason cannot solve all problems, though crying about things in the name of &quot;humanity&quot; &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; just as absurd.  Objectivism breaks down in that it attempts to unravel human interaction using linear and logical methods that are trying to explain things that may or may not be linear or logical.  <br>
<br>
Definition of &quot;human life&quot; for example in terms of abortion rights.  When the right of an individual begins is a very moral, subjective decision.  I believe that until a baby is born it is part of its mother and her property in a legal manner to do with as she wants.  This is not because I understand the definition any better than any other person but simply because I have made a choice.  <br>
<br>
You would argue that it is my reason that makes this choice, and yes, it does, but reason does not always lead to the same conclusion.  Rand never allowed for differing viewpoints and there are a lot of times in her life, some quite dramatic, where she was ruthless with opposition that claimed the use of reason.  Note the schism between Rand and Brandon, for example.  <br>
<br>
In the end her philosophy is a good general outlook and absolutely must be taken into account when setting down the basics of human interaction, the surface interactions between people, but they absoutely cannot and should not be applied to deeper internal matters.  Yes, the sense of self is paramount and a priori to all other facets of an individual, but the self is not where the story ends. <br>
<br>
glade<br>
<br>
note: if you aren't a Randite, my apologies. Basic objectivism in itself is harmless and healthy I think, just not taken to extremes (of which Rand is a good example). <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/utriff.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Triff</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.maclem.com/images/triff/triffdot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 351<br> <font color=#E9D756>(9/29/01 12:40:05 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=194.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ah hah!

But anyway.. call me a Randite if you wish—only meaning that I take mostly everything from objectivism based on her and maybe Piekoff.<br>
<br>
Emotions <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> are</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> the product of your &quot;sense of life,&quot; like she said. I have seen this myself, because just a couple years ago I was a pretty worthless person (one of the <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> filler</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> people who never have opinions on anything at all) and have since changed that. I can see my own changes. Among these is different emotional reactions that I now have. As a small example here, I spent a few weeks feeling this inexplicable emotional pain or misgiving about something a few months back, but when I finally found out what it was and named it and realized that it was stupid, the pain just went away.<br>
<br>
I support abortion rights because it <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> is</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> her body/property—the baby is an actual parasite to her. It relies on <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> her</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> to live, and cannot be supported by anyone else at that point, and therefore is (and ought to be) left to her own choices. The only difference between it and others is that it will, in the <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> future</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->, become a sentient being. I don't think living, conscious people should have to sacrifice their rights to those who are not conscious (whether or not it can change in the future). I do consider that to be reason.<br>
<br>
I don't yet know the full story about Branden and his own beliefs, so I can't really comment on that. But I will say that of her arguments against people claiming to use reason, I've agreed with what I've read. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/utriff.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Triff</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.maclem.com/images/triff/triffdot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 352<br> <font color=#E9D756>(9/29/01 12:49:26 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=194.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Bleh I really didn't get to finish that</span><hr size=1> I meant that what I read about objectivism is mainly just stuff by her/Piekoff, not that they are the omniscient final word.. heh.<br>

What I'd like to do is just jump straight to the creation of the fuzziness.<br>
<br>
Whether you or I like it or not the very definitions of the words we use have both denotative as well as connotative meanings.  Obviously, as connotations change words change their implied meanings, but even denotative meanings can be changed over time.  Denotation is created only when a particular definition is authorized by religion or a nation-state.  <br>
<br>
Thus, what is or is not torture has been argued ever since the rennaisance.  Even terms like torture, nation, religion, culture and humanity were created out of the struggle to define nation versus religion.  This relatively recent concept of seperation of church and state itself is still only as true as we allow it.  Obviously there are many bastions of religion still present in the basis of our government, but we still call it a seperation of church and state.<br>
<br>
My point is this, and rather simple:  While we can argue until we're blue in the face that a fetus is the property of the mother this assumes the fetus &lt;i&gt;does not&lt;/i&gt; have an essential humanity of its own.  Other people assume it actually &lt;i&gt;does&lt;/i&gt; have an essential humanity.  Whether or not everyone applies reason is totally irrelevent when the definitions themselves are changing.<br>

Now realize that this is only a small part of the larger works.  Read in particular the Q and A for number 14 for a nice summary.  As you can see the main problem is there too.  That is that the concept of property and ownership would have to change drastically, and hence why the system is mostly recognized as unworkable by most, and pointed out here by Lanarie.<br>
<br>
In theory it works perfectly.  Leave it to humans to screw it up though.  Greed screws it up.  Emotion screws it up.  Everything screws it up.  But in theory it is perfect.<br>

Ya know, if something doesn't work out in reality... that probably means it <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> isn't</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> a perfect theory. Talking about things that have no base on reality isn't theorizing - it is called hallucinating. This is my take on that.<br>

That is what theorizing is, it's practically a textbook definition.  Regardless, it doesn't change the idea's utility in the real world. <p>Arikel Callistrae <BR>
