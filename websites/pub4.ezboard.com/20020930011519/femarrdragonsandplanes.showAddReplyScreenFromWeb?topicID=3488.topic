In moving back here I found a nice little duplex to live in for a little while so that I could start making plans to build a custom home in the not so distant future. The landlady was nice, the neighbors were reputed to be easygoing and kind, and the location was amazing. I moved in immediately.<br>
<br>
I am a pianist/composer, and a right good one at that. Part of my living income comes from the music I write and produce in my home, though it is nowhere near enough to afford a full rental studio. So, I run a $15k studio out of my second bedroom.<br>
<br>
I only play the piano during the daylight hours without some form of muting or headphones, and I only record between noon and 8:00pm. Even when I *do* fire up the reference monitors and hook up the microphones I do so at reasonable levels. A couple of weeks ago a friend and I were just gearing up to lay down a piece of music when the police showed up a my front door. However, this was not the first visit from the law...<br>
<br>
A week prior to this particular visit I had just hooked up my home theater system, and had some friends over watching a movie at about 8pm. The cop showed up and pointed out that the bass was out of hand, and I soon realized that he was right. During the move the volume on my sub had been cranked, and the bass was really way too serious. I take full responsibility for the mistake, and have since tuned my system to more reasonable levels.<br>
<br>
Anyway, my friend and I are sitting there with our jaws on the floor with a cop at the door. I invited him up to the studio to have a listen, and he accepted. With a cop in the room, my friend and I went back to exactly what we were doing before. He got back to jamming a riff on his acoustic guitar, which was not mic'd or altered in any way, while I played backup on a phased Wurlitzer. The cop bobbed his head, danced around a little, and definitely enjoyed what we were doing. He told us that he did not believe that the noise was anywhere near too loud, but that he could not go to my neighbor's domecile as no name/address had been taken by dispatch. His suggestion was to meet my neighbor and talk it out. I gave this very cool officer a couple of my latest CDs and he left, promising we'd meet again. I believed him. This happened at approximately 1:30 in the afternoon.<br>
<br>
I went to my neighbor's house that afternoon. The neighbor in question is sitting at somewhere between 650-750lbs of pure hugeness, does not ever leave the house, and has no tolerance for anything whatsoever, I soon found. I explained that I wrote the music to make a living, and gave him a couple of copies of my *critically acclaimed* latest CD. Shameless, I know. I also gave him my phone number and asked that he call me next time instead of the cops. God knows he wouldn't walk his fat ass over to knock...<br>
<br>
A couple of days later, at 6:00 in the evening, I sat down to play the piano a bit. I had the volume at a reasonable level, but the call came quickly enough. I turned the levels down, but found them too low to really get any expression out of the Rach I was playing, so I had to resign the session. it was at that point I decided to call the landlady.<br>
<br>
As luck would have it I found my landlady on the back porch of a property just down the road a bit, and invited here over for a chat. She came up to the studio, listened, and agreed that the neighbor was being unreasonable. Even with the backing of the police and the owner of the property, I still looked for alternative ways to ease the situation. I rearranged part of my studio for better sound dispertion and ordered over $300 worth of dampening padding.<br>
<br>
I've lived in this place for over a month, and I've not been able to write a single note since I moved in. Today, with everyone on my side and all steps taken, I decided to play a little more, and perhaps even record a bit. A little while ago, at 10:30am, I opened up the piano. Halfway through a Scriaban the phone rang.<br>
<br>
&quot;Please turn that down. I'm getting tired of asking.&quot;<br>
<br>
And what did I do? I turned it down, and found that again I could not play at that level. So, I've stopped once again for the morbidly obese arse next door.<br>
<br>
Every morning at 3:00am his wife leaves the house in a Chevrolet pickup with echo pipes, waking up half the neighborhood. These folks are about to have police on their doorstep every single morning at 3:15 until they sell or fix that truck. If he even considers turning on his television, he'll be visited by the police. His poor wife works two jobs to support his eating necessity. On that note, I have *always* checked for her presence before playing the piano, simply out of neighborly courtesy. The poor woman needs her sleep, God knows.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I'm at the end of my rope on this. This guy's inability to deal with life is starting to bleed heavily into my passion for writing music. I've done all I can think to do to be nice about it. All out war is coming... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/utoxxthewizard.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Toxx The Wizard</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 625<br> <font color=#E9D756>(7/24/02 8:22:47 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3488.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Arserag neighbors</span><hr size=1> Perhaps your next composition could be inspired by these events.

Going to have to side with the neighbors on this one.  The apartment complex is their home, not a place of business like a recording studio; they shouldn't have to listen to you play the piano for 8 hours a day.<br>
<br>
I'm sure you think your music is lovely, but lots of people like country music and I sure wouldn't want to listen to country music for 8 hours a day.<br>

<br>
Barring this I would have suggested you just carry on and not answer him. Let him call the police and have them tell him he's out of order.<br>
<br>
Don't call the police in for his truck. At the moment they are on your side but as soon as you start using them in an attempt to play games that help will dissolve. They have the right to stop you both making noise and where will that get you?<br>
<br>
My advice would be to phone the police and explain the predicament. Give them the name of the officer that was good to you, and explain that both he and your landlady felt the music was not at an excessive level. At this point they'll note it for the files. Ask them for their advice.<br>
<br>
Then the next time he rings up to complain say this &quot;Both the landlady and the police do not feel that the music I am playing is excessively loud but please feel free to call them if you have proof to the contrary. In the meantime I intend to continue as this is my livelihood&quot;<br>
<br>
When he calls the landlady he only naffs her off. When he calls the police they will have it noted that he is being a problem caller and they will deal with it. <p><CENTER><A HREF="http://ak.lonelygamer.com">

I don't think he was saying that he plays every hour every day, I believe he was saying he only does his composing at times between noon and 8pm.<br>

<br>
Toxx: True enough, raw emotion can be a useful addition to any composer's arsenal. I've not lost my love of writing through much more detrimental circumstances, incuding an explosion that cost most of my right-hand mobility and ability to play at any level for a couple of years. This guy won't be the end of anything, for sure.<br>
<br>
Gloriana: I don't play 8 hours a day, by any stretch. As a matter of fact I do most of my plinking in the wee hours of the morning with headphones on. On a good day I play no more than 30-45 minutes in the daytime, just to listen with full resonance what I wrote the night before on headphones. Since I've lived here I've not even attempted to play during the day more than a few times, each of which was squashed. I've not been able to play more than 3 hours straight at any time since the explosion, just to clear that up.<br>
<br>
Barrymore: Thanks, and I will =)<br>
<br>
Kerryn: You're right, I should never have given him my number, but I thought it was a good idea at the time for several reasons. I thought that once he learned that I wasn't just jamming to the Eagles or something and actually writing he'd change his views on it a wee bit. That was also the suggestion of the really cool police officer, and following his suggestions seemed like a good course of action. I do keep a log of everything I do to fix the situation. I keep track of his calls, the steps I've taken to quieten the room, and the money I've spent on the foam and other dampening equipment. This was also the officer's suggestion. I have contemplated telling him pretty much exactly what you put in the post, though my nature is not to impose on him at the moment. It'll come to a critical point at some time in the near future, and the repeated calls and my repeated attempts to remedy ther situation without bothering the police or landlady can only help to strengthen my case. I can still do more, and until I've done it I won't bring them back into it. Regarding his truck, you are right there. I haven't called yet, and I actually probably won't. It's nice to blow off steam now and then though.<br>
<br>
Dunwut: Close. I compose 24 hours a day. I play the piano in the middle of the night to see if those ideas work. I play them with full openess during daylight hours. If they're good I record them between noon and 8pm.<br>
<br>
I forgot to mention as well that the previous tenant had a newborn baby. When I brought up the situation to my landlady she informed me that he had called many times complaining about the baby crying in the middle of the night, though nobody else could really hear it at all. When I was over there to talk to him, his daughter (yes, he has kids...God only knows how) turned on a TV in the back room. I could barely hear a faint noise from the TV, while he apparently took offense to it. He screamed at her to turn it down when it was nowhere near loud. I sincerely doubt she could even hear her program well in the same room after lowering the volume. A few minutes later his wife brought a ironing board into the living room and unfolded it, which caused a slight screech from the springs and need of a little bit of oil. Honestly it was nowhere near loud. He again went off the deep end, yelling at her to &quot;WD-40 that @#%$ thing!&quot; He is apparently hypersensitive to sound, which I am truly sorry to hear. His problems, however, are not mine. He's proven an inability to handle himself, so it's not my responsibility to take care of his poor ears...not long term, anyway. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ughie.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ghie</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 538<br> <font color=#E9D756>(7/24/02 8:51:37 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3488.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Arserag neighbors</span><hr size=1> Living in homes that share surfaces (walls/floors/ceilings etc...) requires accomodation from all parties.<br>

Your neighbor sounds like a simple unhappy type who takes out his displeasure on everyone around him.<br>
<br>
You might want to consider better sound proofing on the studio room, even if it means tacking ugly foam on all the walls and ceiling. I don't know what impact this would have on the sound quality though and this may not be something you would do.<br>
<br>
Otherwise, the best course of action may be caller ID and ignore the neighbor and let the police/courts/landlord arbitrate. If the police find the music within reasonable limits, perhaps, you could look into charging your neighbor with harrassment. I am not a lawyer so I don't really know that that is an option.<br>
<br>
Do what you need to do, and don't worry about the neighbor. Its not your reponsibility to provide his life with happiness, and you cannot be expected to change your life to accomodate his grouchiness.<br>

No way, that foam is beautiful! Check out www.auralex.com to see how some people have cut cool shapes and what not. I think I'm going to repattern mine into musical notes sometime soon.<br>
<br>
I've dropped a wad of cash on it already. Foam doesn't actually soundproof though. It's meant as a dampening material to take the edge off rebounding tones. While it does keep some sound from passing through, it's really used to get a better mix. I already had a little in some key spots, but I placed an order for $300 more after this situation came up. Most people believe that it is used to stop sound transfer. I'll let them continue believing that as long as it helps here, and in the meantime the extra foam will only make the final product sound better.<br>

<br>
Anyway to the point.  Most of our recording these days is done in a studio, but before we had the studio available we used our home stereo to record and we generally had to use headphones (since I live in a cul-de-sac).  We were able to work fine, and actually produced some of our best songs in that little home setup.<br>
<br>
I feel sorry for you having a fat, miserable, wanker of a neighbour that won't let you play your music, but it's really not that bad using headphones.  Granted you have to use an electric piano/organ, but it's better than not being able to record anything.<br>

This despite the fact that you couldn't hear my music from outside the apartment, while all around us in the same complex we have mariachi and rap music blaring from wide open windows all day long.<br>
<br>
The old woman confronted me on the sidewalk on the street on evening while I was standing outside with a friend, and began haranging me about my music being too loud, my footsteps being too loud, the way I flush the toilet being too loud, the way I turn on the shower being too loud . . . seriously.  It was at this moment I realized that she was actually a fruitbat in human form.  I had never, ever, raised my voice to an older person in my life, but when this old woman said, &quot;I guess you just make so much noise because you're an elephant&quot; -- for God's sake, I'm 6'3 and 220 pounds!  I'm just a tall guy, not some morbidly obese hippo!!! -- I lost it.  I went off.  I roared in her face about how she was crazy and insane, and told her to go @#%$ herself.<br>
<br>
The next day, she baked me some bread and apologized.<br>
<br>
Our civilized detente continued for a while.  She would pigeonhole me on the apartment steps and tell me about her and her 45-year-old daughter's &quot;female problems.&quot;  I had suddenly become her best friend.<br>
<br>
Three months passed.<br>
<br>
Then, one evening, I was listening to some mp3's on my PC -- again, not loudly -- and I suddenly heard and felt a thumping below my feet.  I turned the music *off* so that I could get an idea what the hell was going on downstairs.  A few moments later there came a rapping at my front door.  I opened it to discover the old fruitbat, who yelled at me, &quot;Aren't you going to turn it down?&quot;<br>
<br>
Remember, at this point there was no music at all in my apartment.  &quot;Turn what down?&quot; I asked politely if a bit faceitously.<br>
<br>
&quot;That damn music!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;It's not even on right now.  And wasn't this a dead issue?  I wasn't playing my music a moment ago any more loudly than I ever do.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;And I've been pounding on the ceiling for months trying to get you to stop!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Urm, no, you haven't.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I went to the apartment office and complained but they said I had to come talk to you myself!&quot;<br>
<br>
This was a flat-out lie.  The apartment office wants there to be no conflict between the tenants and has asked anyone with a noise complaint to come to them directly.<br>
<br>
So I said, &quot;Frankly, I doubt that very much.  This is the final time I will ever speak to you on this matter.  My music is not played at an inappropriate level.  I very rarely have friends over and generally am one of the quietest neighbors you will ever have.  So why don't you just @#%$ OFF.&quot;<br>
<br>
And I slammed the door in her face.<br>
<br>
A few moments later there were some VERY angry-sounding footsteps running down the stairs and she slammed her door in frustration.<br>
<br>
First thing the next morning I went to the apartment manager's office and outlined every encounter I'd had with the old woman.  It turned out that she was well-known by them for complaining about every little thing she could -- from cracks in the pavement to toddlers being allowed by their parents to run around naked -- and was regarded as a crank.  &quot;Don't worry about the noise issue,&quot; they said.  &quot;We stopped outside your door a couple of times after her complaints and measured the sound with a decibel meter and could barely tell anything was going on.&quot;<br>
<br>
Apparently the next time she went to them to complain, they told her to quit harrassing me or they'd put a nuisance mark on her record.  There has been nary a peep from her for the last three or four months.  When she sees me coming she goes the other way.<br>
<br>
I won.<br>
<br>
I just wish I hadn't had to battle with her at all.<br>

<br>
I had a neighbor that was remarkably hypocritical when it came to noise.  This toe-jam complained on more than a few occasions about hearing me or my guests walking around in my apartment 10 years ago.  The building was over 50 years old and had a bit of an echo.  Yet, he would spend 3-4 hours at a time, 2-3 days a week, using power equipment to sand and  cut furniture on his patio below me.  And he'd do it at all hours of the day.<br>
<br>
After his third complaint regarding a friend of mine walking around the apartment, and she weighed only 100 lbs, I put him on my /ignore list and informed him that I didn't want to hear another noise complaint out of him.  He made one a week later, and I slammed the door in his face.<br>
<br>
He then went to the landlord and the rent control board.  They refused to do anything about my walking around the apartment or any other normal use.  However, they did place some rather stringent limits on his refinishing business out of his residence.<br>
<br>
Moral of the story:  Complainers usually get theirs.  Whether it ends up being the Boy-Who-Cried-Wolf or simple loss of patience, don't worry about this idiot. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <br><font color=#E9D756>- </font><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/bemarr>Erollisi Marr, The Queen of Love</a><font color=#E9D756> - </font><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes>Rants and Flames</a> <font color=#E9D756> - </font> <br>
