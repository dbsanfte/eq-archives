<br>
For those of you who feel you deserve a res (port too for that matter) either group / make friends  with a cleric (druid or wiz) or level one up yourself .<br>
<br>
Before you judge him for what he said maybe you should ask him what the druid may have said to him first . Nothing pisses a cleric off more than to be told your res isn't good enough ... nothing pisses a druid off more than to be told we need you to take us here but sorry your going to have to leave cause your class isn't good enough to group with us.<br>
<br>
Having played both of these classes I can tell you that there are TONS of a$$holes that play this game that think these classes log on only for the purpose of making their life easier but when you need help from same person begging you ... you get jack  in return .<br>
<br>
That said I don't charge for ports or res's but I no longer go out of my way to do either for people I don't know unless they happen to die deep in the same dungeon my group is in. Guess after reading the tons of nasty tells I've gotten over the 2 years I've played this game has made me pretty jaded.<br>

Gat/Flat has obviously built up a good reputation with the people who have met and grouped with him, so we know he is not some immature, lame, scam artist. The fact that so many are willing to stand by him should be a testament to the fact that there may have been more going on than just what was seen. <p>Ziktiny 51 necro EQ<br>

People this once again is an example of why perhaps it is better to * before you start a flame.<br>
<br>
*option #1  Mind ones own business  <br>
<br>
*option #2  At the very least talk to the parties involved before you post a rant about something you were not directly involved in.<br>
<br>
P.S. Nirecad there are some of us (including Kraagaoth) who have actually have a long term memory.  It is not worth the time to drudge up every damn flame about you, however there are many of us who still remember the posts about your heroic Dragon slaying days.... (nothing personal about you, as I do not know you.  Just giving a little background as to what Kraagaoth may have been referring to) <p><p align=center>Mismort Proxalot<br>

I had a wild hair on my ass... and was anon going to hit bank then off to a guild function... I got trained on in kael and was killed... Appear at my bind and was pissed off... zone back into EW anon get a tell 2 secs after i am in zone while anon asking 'you a cleric?' I ignored this as i am anon and going back to get my body and it peeves me to have somebody with the guts to ask me that when i am anon. I generally only go anon when on a raid or when in an area that the chance of somebody bothering me to beg for buffs/rez/heal/cure. Then see the ooc paying well for rez... considering..<br>
<br>
1. i was dead and way beyond pissed off cause of the death in kael.<br>
2. who the frag asks any anon person that zones into a zone if they happen to be a cleric.<br>
3. Was the only 49+ cleric in the zone...<br>
<br>
that means guess what... you want my attention after pissing me off and doing something like random tells asking people if they are a cleric while i am on a CR means yes I am going to be an ass and yes it is going to cost you...<br>
<br>
And their auction was not 200pp for a rez it was paying well for a 49+ rez.. and i smarted off like 1k well? Nirecnad and that other guy went off on it there and it justed egged me on to get their goats... long boring run without SoW from GD to Kael.<br>
<br>
Yes if i am doing something and somebody sends me a tell to go rez them half the world away I make it known in a financial sort of the way taht I dont' wanna do it... but hell if somebody wants to pay some exorbitant fee for me to take time from my playing which as Oj said gets screwed with work and such as that... sure i will do it... or they going to say just like nirecnad said and call me a greedy prick and go begging somebody else to come rez them for something stupid that has happened.<br>
<br>
example some 29 monk bought it in Befallen when they had those changes gm event or whatever there... sends me a tell for a rez while i was out in OOT campin jboots... told him that it was 250pp per zone line i had to cross to rez him... aka basically told him in a financially biased way to fook off and that i wasn't comin.. if he wants to pay that fee.. hmm sure.. a fool and his money is soon parted. do the math that was 1250pp for that rez...<br>

One time I had a massive run of bad luck holding onto level 39 (spell level for a magician), dinging it like seven times.  When I lost it an eighth time when I died thinking  I had enough of a buffer.  So I asked someone to shout in the zone (I was several away) /shout Salenie is looking for a 49+ rez, and she's offering a web shield for it.  This is back when a web shield was worth about 1k, and it's not a bad item for a cleric regardless.  Got it within 15 minutes.  An alt in the zone switched over to his cleric and ran three zones.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>Salenie Silkweaver<BR>Proud Member of <a href=" http://www.clanbattleaxe.com">Clan Battle Axe</a>
