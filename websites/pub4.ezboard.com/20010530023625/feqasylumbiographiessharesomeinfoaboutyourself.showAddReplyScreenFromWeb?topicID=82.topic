<br>
&quot;...On the third day of the new year I had the sad duty of bidding goodbye to this brief and wonderful companion, and as much as she taught me to look within myself as well as the world around me, I seek now to turn my gifts humbly upon her, so that I may better extol her virtues which shine so brightly and apparently to me, though perhaps do not gleam so great under my own humble pen. With that goal in mind, bear patience, dear reader, and open your heart to the (admittedly brief) tale that follows.<br>
<br>
Embodied within Kailya is the true spirit of the Quellian religion and the dedication of a true Paladin of the faith, which she strives to be in not only practice, but also in name. Nothing is more apparent, upon first speaking with her, than the romantic ideals that she fulfills so well. Quellious has blessed this young woman with the gift to look within, and understand her own desires and motivations, but this knowledge has not softened the startling intensity of her convictions.<br>
<br>
I shall explain: Kailya is, of course, an Erudite, and though I claim not to be an expert in the ways of these aloof and (sometimes overly) proud people, it is simple for any Man to understand the pressures of her highborn childhood. She was, and still is, I suppose, of a family of great stature within the kingdom-city of Erudin, and since birth was her life planned and her hand arranged in marraige to a Prince of some sort within the city. Even though she was raised to know this, still she felt her freedom constrained, though not maliciously, by her own parents. These troubling feelings are seemingly alien for someone raised as she was, and it is not known even to Kailya from what event they draw their origin, or she chose simply not to confide these truths to me.<br>
<br>
Nevertheless, as a child she did, naturally, not grasp the full extent of her needs. Instead, a general uneasiness and indeed a malaise marked her younger years. I perceive that only by thankful trait of her family did she maintain any commendable physical health during this period of time in her life, for she led not an active or exciting childhood, certainly not one that would normally lead to the development of such a fit and able paladin that I have seen her to be today.<br>
<br>
The beliefs of Quellious were introduced to her as a matter of standard education in Erudin, and a handful of perceptive and diligent priests of this Deity probed deeply into her constant sadness, as a matter of their duties. Even this did not yield understanding to them, nor to her, in any appreciably short time.<br>
<br>
As Kailya has explained it to me, I will now try to impart onto paper the moment of profound change within her life, upon which all situations regarding her afterward are hinged upon, much as a crack within a dam may begin what becomes a great, unhindered flow of water through the wall that constrained it previously. On what was an unremarkable day in her progressing childhood, she happened to witness the beating of a dog. Now, such a thing is a jarring scene to imagine in one's mind, especially thrust upon us as I do know upon you. Consider however that Kailya had witnessed the beating of this particular dog before; many times, in fact, as a matter of discipline by its master. This was not a new sight to her at all, and it in fact was nearly as commonplace in her sense of things as scolding a child may be. On this particular day, however, the dog had a most uncharacteristic response - for this particular pet which she had seen be harshly reprimanded so many times. In Kailya's words, it seemed to shrink in upon itself, look deep inside itself - and how she saw this, I do not know, but I assure you that she did see this - then come to a distinct decision within its mind. It then reared up and with a ferocious growl, struck in return at its master.<br>
<br>
What followed as a consequence of that action, Kailya never learned, for the master, injured and suddenly gripped with fury and shame, noticed her and presently chased her away with harsh words. But she was already changed. Kailya has described to me that there was, in a sense, a great bell inside her that was struck for the first time and reverberated throughout her body, and has ever since. It forced her to look with open eyes at herself for the first time, instead of taking everythign in her life, good and bad, for granted. She questioned her life for the first time, and came to a very simple realization. Her life which was so carefully and painstakingly prescribed for her was not of her choosing. Indeed, it is a wonder she did not realise it earlier, but this life also did not suit her by one single wit. The reveberations of this phantom bell inside her body filled her with astounding energy, as if it threatened to physically pick her up and shake her out of the city and into the ocean that lay at its side.<br>
<br>
It was that night that she ran away from her family, and in fact ran away from Erudin. Admitted by herself, Kailya was a young girl of sixteen, and an unworldly one at that. It was, in fact, the priests of Quellious that took her in, and then sent her from Erudin to Qeynos that night. Judge them not sternly, for you must understand their reasoning as Kailya has explained it to me. Quellious demands, above all, the search within and understaning of self, and consider a towering injustice to be the sad situation in that a person, Erudite or otherwise, chooses to forsake their true feelings. Presumably they percieved the understanding that Kailya came to, that the life her parents had chosen for her did not suit her spirit. They also understood, as Kailya does, that she had be free of the constraints of her present life, to begin anew. Even I was shocked at the thought of a girl of barely adult age being sent away from her homeland with nothing but the blessing of Quellious upon her brow. <br>
<br>
But I have since come to think there are powerful philosphies wielded within the halls of Quellian temples. Kailya has been blessed. She has survived against all odds, sometimes under circumstances that make this solemn priest struggle not to cry out, &quot;Divine intervention is at hand!&quot; The very virtues that make her a consummate Paladin are derived from her oppressive childhood, her strict upbringing, and her inexplicable love of travel and discovery. I have no doubt that the hand of Quellious is truly at work within her.<br>
<br>
Kailya will accomplish great things, mark my words. For I am diviner in service of Rodcet Nife, and his eye gives me great vision. <br>
<br>
I hope my explanation serves to give at least a little insight into the respect and friendship I feel for my newfound companion, who has now left again upon her endless journeying. When honour and fame do clutch her to their perfumed bosoms, this journal may prove to be a valuable insight, I hope. I myself will continue to try to understand what makes a person such as her, Erudite or otherwise, develop such admirable qualities, and perhaps I can use that knowledge to instill them into my own children....&quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

I might have to add to this at some point and continue the story of what has happened since then <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
