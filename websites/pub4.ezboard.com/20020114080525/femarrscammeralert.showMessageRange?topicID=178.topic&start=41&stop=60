<br>
Having followed a link over there recently regarding another player that was selling after saying how  leet his character was, I observed that there doesn't seem to be a way to warn others about lies contained in the sale or to critique the seller.  This particular character had a thread in rants and flames.  His sale claimed that he had a great reputation and was in an uber-guild, yet that was patently false.  Unfortunately, there was no way to post that information along with the sale figure to warn anyone that might buy it.<br>
<br>
Playerauctions ought to include that functionality.  Although it might reduce their sales in the short term, it'd probably work to both increase sales and decrease complaints.<br>

IF you knew how to read, you would know that Lorenzo or whatever never scammed druidformonkitems who is neeoTZ. He got his shit eventually. So why do you want his real life info posted? He did nothing wrong except e-bay his account. And even if he did scam someone it's a fucking game, you don't screw with someone's life over a game.

A fucking pixelated video game. There's no reason to bring it to real life. Posting his real life information on a public board is like kicking a man in the balls. It doesn't matter if he posted all that information on e-bay or not. He posted that info for people to contact him so he could sell his account. Not so some snot nosed punk who couldn't wait 2 days for his account info to put it all up on this board so people could harass him. That's like saying because I found some dudes's personal information in a newspaper ad that it's ok to post it all here to have people harass him. Well after all, it was already public information right?? I have no sympathy for people who buy everquest items off e-bay.

<br>
Sure, taking the game to real life is foolish.  However, Lorenzo did just that when he promised a couple of players to exchange real money for their toon.  If you really read the thread, you'll see I condemned neeoTZ's comments based on Lorenzo being a few hours late on the transfer.  The second poster had his items overdue more than a week.  The only &quot;info&quot; posted was Lorenzo's phone number.  Hardly that intrusive.  The guy deserved a couple of crank calls.  As he lives in Italy, not too many folks would've bothered. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon2.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uogmuk.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ogmuk</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>ezOP</span><br>  Posts: 516<br> <font color=#E9D756>(10/16/01 11:04:10 am)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.dakor.net/ogmuk/ppic2.jpg WIDTH=88 HEIGHT=108></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: EBAYER, Lorenzo Conevevole (Mesque), EMARR SCAMMER.....</span><hr size=1> I often save posts before I delete them, as I did in this case.

I have paid cash at a Western Union office and had the money delivered to Rome, Italy to the person shown above. I am going to post this every where that I can. Any ideas on where I should post this to let people know about this injustice? I don't want this guy doing this ever again especially all of you here that value your hard earned money. I have also read the post made 'LoL' (stranger) and am reposting here because it's good information to try to prevent frauds in the future:<br>
<br>
1) Verify the account or item is real..If he/she will not meet you in the game..or misses several times...end it right then forget him.<br>
2) Talk with him/her on the phone..If any conflicts like misses the call or etc...end it forget about the deal..SAVE YOUR MONEY!!! <br>
3) If he/she is pushy &quot;I have other bidders wanting this&quot; or any thing that just sounds like he/she is trying to force the sale...RUN RUN RUN DONT BUY!!!. <br>
4) If you can use paypal, ensure that you change the &quot;Funding Options&quot; to your credit card. If using Western Union, use www.westernunion.com and use your credit card to send payment ...and make sure to use the show ID option. <br>
5) If you use paypal make sure you only buy from a verified/confirmed address..with your credit card..not paypal funds or bank funds. When the payment amount is greater than your PayPal account balance, you can change the payment method (i.e. from Instant Transfer to eCheck or Credit Card) by clicking the &quot;Funding Options&quot; link under the &quot;Source of Funds&quot; heading on the payment confirmation page. When you use a credit card, you have the option of contacting the credit card company and letting them know of the purchase without delivery if the person doesn't deliver what was auctioned.<br>
6) Ask for references if he/she has any...when you have them on the phone ask several questions to the referal is possible..if the seller wont give you a few days to get this done..most likey you should run run run. <br>
7) And most importantly use the email address to &quot;track&quot; his history on other sites like ebay, yahoo etc..since most of the time if he/she is a scammer..they're trying this on more then just this site.<br>
8) If you're buying a character, ensure the person uses postal mail to send you the original Everquest, Kunark and Velious CD's with the CD-Keys included.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <p><BR>

<br>
After a bit of time you will see that. Any rep can be turned around from good to bad or bad to good. I saw an enchanter that screwed over one of the most uber guilds and sell his account and the new guy got shit forever for it, but once they realized he was a way better guy than the idiot who owned him before he developed a pretty good rep for being a danm good person to have around.<br>
<br>
The new mesque will prove that too and I for one would group with his owner through hell and back. Infact I have already as we both have played together for 2 years. You can change your spots if you want to and if people are too blind to see that well.....their loss.<br>
