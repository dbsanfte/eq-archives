<br>
<br>
I was in EC attempting to buy gear for my Druid one day. I had been auctioning to sell an EE Bag and to buy druid gear. I then received a tell from Okenthorn bidding 100pp on an EE Bag!! Yeah right friend, he held out a little longer and then responded again saying he would pay 400pp (the regular price) on the bag. THEN, i saw someone auctioning a Kunzar Cloak so I told em to come over to Shady Swash and I'd buy it. As i was waiting for both people at shady swash i cleaned out my EE Bag. First arrived the person with the kunzar cloak, so i put up the money and bought it. Since Okenthorn was right in front of me i proceeded to put up the EE Bag in trade ( While not checking to see if the cloak i had bought landed in it =(..)<br>
BIF MISTAKE! I sold bag to Okenthorn and then i looked thru all my bags for the cloak. I then realized it had fallen into my ee bag which i just sold. i immediately told okenthorn and at first he ignored me. Later he just gave me the lame excuse of &quot;what r u talkin bout? wat cloak? i dont see any cloak?&quot;. I then yelled at him for a bit telling him i knew he had it. So i decided to go find him. After tracking him i got right up in his face and demanded my cloak back. He then proceeds to &quot;Yawn Rudely&quot; in my face and laugh at me. THEN, the F*CKER puts on invis and runs. I was frustrated at the fact that such a holes like okenthorn ruin the game for others. Then Pera sent me a tell. I was shocked at what had happened. She told me that Okenthorn had asked her what the going rate on cloak was and EVEN asked her to auction it for him. I PETITIONED. AS USUAL the worthless GM told me that it was not enough proof and that they couldn't do anything about it. So then i sent a tell to his guild leader telling him about what had happened. As it turns out Okenthorn and his guild learder are RL friends and he lied to me. Whaza  as he was called tells me &quot; i look in his shit all the time and he didnt have a cloak&quot; HOW WOULD HE LOOK FOR CLOAK IF OKENTHORN HAD JUST TAKEN IT AND OKENTHORN WAS STILL ON?????!!! <br>
<br>
*Shrug* <br>
<br>
Again i warn you all Okenthorn already has the rep for scamming people in EC as I later found out.. I please urge you all not to have anything to do with this scammer.<br>

Since this episode, I ulled my other character out of his guild and stopped associating with them.   Heard today, from the mouth of Whaza's best friend, Okenthorn, that Whaza has now bought an account, a lvl 52 Necro named 'Crypt'.  So, I do beleive both these persons to be thieves.   Whaza is leader of guild, and am sure he still is.  Forgotten Phantoms is name of it, I am ashamed to have been in it while this was all going on and ashamed to have helped him create it.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Shoot me a tell in game Seliak.   Let me know if your cloak was replaced.  If it was not, I will purchase another for you.  This was a bad situation and I am afraid I feel responsible for it cus at the time, Whaza and Okenthorn both were my friends.   Beleive me, choosing friends alot more wisely and safely now.<br>
<br>
That is why to most of you, i have been a royal bitch in the game, just being careful at who i choose for friends.  Nothing personal.  RL shit has also forced me to this.<br>
<br>
Anyway, sorry for what had happened.   But thank you for posting it so i know what really happened, and, letting all of us know to make sure we check those packs before trading off.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
