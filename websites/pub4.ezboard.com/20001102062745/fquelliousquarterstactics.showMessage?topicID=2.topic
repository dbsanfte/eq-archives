As a level 41 Necromancer, I have yet to try, but my understanding is that when you get in, you run for the corner called 'camp 1'. If you get attempted, you stop and either die, or feign death to prevent from training those who have already made it to camp 1. <BR>   <BR> Is this the basic initial strategy? If so, can it be improved at all?  <BR>  <BR> Olibri of E'Ci <BR>  <BR> Jessy <BR> unregistered  <BR> posted 01-24-2000 10:54 PM             <BR>  <BR> I seriously doubt you'll find anyone willing to share their strategies for breaking into PoF that can do it successfully, as this will lead to more ppl being able to do the zone, and thus less reward for those who can already get in the zone <BR>  <BR> Jessy Pureheart <BR> Mithaniel Marr <BR>  <BR> a registration cursed enc <BR> unregistered  <BR> posted 01-24-2000 11:25 PM             <BR>  <BR> Well that's a pretty bad outlook don't you think? with a name like pureheart too. <BR>  <BR> When did it become us against us anyway? We call them &quot;monsters&quot; for a reason, they're the bad guys here. I hate to sound mean, but i think this kind of thinking is alot of the problem with the game lately. I have 2 lists, my /friends list, which gets really good players or nice helpful people, and a list that sits next to my keyboard that gets the selfish bickering people. Not that my opinion matters that much to you, but there are some of us that tryto be nice, and i find it's alot easier if we stay away from the &quot;no way, it's mine&quot; people like you. <BR>  <BR> Ballatik Urballop of CT <BR> Order of the Mystic Dragon <BR>  <BR> hrm, got kinda warm there, gotta say &quot;some of the above is solely my opinion, and may not reflect the opinion of my guild&quot; <BR>  <BR> Gospadin <BR> Newbie Poster  <BR> posted 01-24-2000 11:52 PM            <BR>  <BR> The issue is this though... <BR>  <BR> Most of the people who learned how to break it did it with a huge amount of trial and error, losing level upon level of experience trying to get their technique, strategy, and tactics working. <BR>  <BR> If I and 23 of my closest friends all lose 3 levels, but come up with a great way to break PoF in the future, what good does it do us to share that information? <BR>  <BR> Mithanial Marr has probably ~400 level 46+ characters on the server, at least. At most 24 can be in any given plane. With 75 people in lower guk on weeknights, and every guard, npc, and monster camped in every single zone, why should people give away the one bit of information that lets them actually adventure? <BR>  <BR> When word gets out on new tactics, no respect is paid to the people who learned it first. Those people who lost their levels find themselves at the bottom of 50 person lists for a zone with 14 hour respawn, and could wait 3-4 days just to get in there, only to be in a lotto with 15 other people over some item. <BR>  <BR> If I am &quot;nice&quot; as you put it, odds are I'll never get into the zone again until the next reboot, meaning that those who put the time into learning the zone get about 12 hours in there while they clear it, then as soon as they go to sleep, all the 46+ newbies rush in there and hog the zone until the next reboot, farming all the good items. Why should I lose 3 levels so that I can watch a ton of other players in full PoF armor, who obviously have no clue how to play their classes? Good gear should be a badge of honor showing that you know what you're doing enough to kill the mob that dropped it, but in a server as packed as they are now, that simply isn't possible. <BR>  <BR> *wishes all servers were as uncrowded as test was a few months ago* <BR> Gos <BR>  <BR> Nobody <BR> unregistered  <BR> posted 01-24-2000 11:57 PM             <BR>  <BR> Well... putting my 2cp into the discussion...there are two ways of breaking for &quot;camp 1&quot;, <BR>  <BR> 1) Load up invis to animal and invis to undead(or something like that) and one by one go for the camp spot.  Hopefully you will have enough people successfully reached to spot.(Especially clerics) <BR>  <BR> 2) Have a shaman(the only binding class that can withstand quite a few hit) bind himself outside the gate. And make a corpse of himself with his stuff on it. Load up symbol rune IV reso... and SOW, then RUN IN PULL ALL THE ROAMERS AWAY FROM THE GATE! Then the brave soul gives signal for all to zone in and run for the spot. This is a much faster way but can potentially bring doom to ALL if the window of opportunity is not big enough. <BR>  <BR>  <BR> Musil <BR> Newbie Poster  <BR> posted 01-25-2000 12:59 AM            <BR>  <BR> Wow, I'm glad I'm not on Mith Mar. What a bunch of jerks must rule that server. <BR>  <BR> I'll gladly post the standard method on Fennin, as I understand it. <BR>  <BR> Only casters break. The tanks wait until they do. The objective is to get to &quot;Corpse Corner&quot; as we call it and BIND. Then you gate out. You probably do this one person at a time to prevent training. You may use a suicidal tank who leaves all of his stuff on a corpse outside to train stuff away from the gate, or you may not. When all casters have bound inside . . . you make groups, each withn a wizzie or druid . . . and you all gate in at once.  You start killing things, and if need be . . .you evac, rest up and try it again. When enough of the patrollers are dead that it is safe for tanks to come in . . the zone is considered broken and you'll have no problem going all the way. <BR>  <BR> -Musil <BR> 50 Bard on Fennin Ro <BR>  <BR> Nobody <BR> unregistered  <BR> posted 01-25-2000 02:05 AM             <BR>  <BR> On my server, there are about 6 7 lvl 50 clerics camped at the spot all the time.(character not actively played anymore.) Sorta of an emergency back-up system when things go REALLY bad.(Like no cleric successfully log off b4 a train kills everybody.) <BR>  <BR>  <BR> Tuucan <BR> unregistered  <BR> posted 01-25-2000 02:33 AM             <BR>  <BR> On tarrew marr we do it this way... <BR>  <BR> Necros(level 48+necros with alot of plane experence) go to left wall and play dead...when roamers leave they stand and make pets...they kill a few things and play dead...wait make more pets kill stuff and play dead/gate..while they breakin it only necros/monks SK's are there because they can all FD....works fairly well if no newbies who leveled on guards to 50 dont come then its all hell breaks loose and screws the necros work and makes more roamers (all critters will roam til they reach there spawn point and that can take hours at least) <BR>  <BR> Tuucan <BR> 48th druid  <BR> Proud member of the Amber knights <BR> (pulling fear is hard on your exp=/ ) <BR>  <BR>  <BR> Lupen <BR> unregistered  <BR> posted 01-25-2000 02:34 AM             <BR>  <BR> HAHA Musil, thats a good one. <BR>  <BR> Lupen, prexus <BR>  <BR> IP: Logged <BR> Aanadien <BR> Veteran Poster  <BR> posted 01-25-2000 03:04 AM            <BR>  <BR> Musil isn't joking. That's how it's done on Fennin. I've been in on a break once myself, so I've seen this work. (And boy did it feel funny to bind in PoF.) <BR>  <BR> The only correction I'd make to Musil's account is that you don't gate out after binding. (Being a bard, he's never done this part personally. It's an easy error to make.) You exit via revive. Just before you go into PoF, you lose a duel. While you make your run to the binding place, a cleric is standing over your body ready to yank you outta there the instant you finish binding or get in trouble. (If you get in trouble, you head AWAY from the bind point, all the while yelling for the cleric to pull you.) <BR>  <BR> This strategy was developed by the Shining Force guild, and it's a great piece of work. <BR>  <BR> And yes, a group of all casters is perfectly capable of clearing all the patrollers. As long as they have half a dozen good necros. I have seen this done with my own eyes, so don't even bother saying it can't be done. <BR>  <BR> ------------------ <BR> Aanadien Al'Alanthor <BR> 50 Enchanter <BR> Fennin Ro <BR> GM, The Fallen (Formerly the Judean People's Front) <BR>  <BR> Greks <BR> unregistered  <BR> posted 01-25-2000 03:35 AM             <BR>  <BR> I just have to say that I don't think that it is selfish to keep game strategies secret. People who want everything given to them make me sick. The problem with EQ right now is not only rude people, but people who don't want to work for their equipment. They want to join a guild that will twink them all to hell. They beg for people to give stuff to their newbies. They want to know how to break PoF so that they don't have to actually think for themselves. Maybe it's just me, but I would think that PoF equipment is much more satisfying if I have to work for it. I would think that it would be very satisfying to say that me and my group figured out how to break PoF on our own.  <BR>  <BR> But oh no. Some people want it all handed to them on a nice little platter. And then get pissy when someone doesn't tell them how to break PoF.  <BR>  <BR> I don't have a problem with the people who posted how to break PoF because it obviously doensn't bother them to answer the question. I'm just pissed off that some of you would give people a bunch of crap for not telling you anything. You should have the decency to respect the fact that they earned their information the hard way.  <BR>  <BR>  <BR> Phire Phoenix <BR> unregistered  <BR> posted 01-25-2000 03:48 AM             <BR>  <BR> Although I can't Say it is Selfish to Keep Strategies Secret, I do find it rather Odd that people so not willing to Share Their Strategy would be checking these Boards to learn other peoples strategy. Kind of a &quot;I want but I won't Give attitude&quot;. I think BB has given up on Fear atm, With Sky So much better Fear isn't even worth the trouble anymore, it's just a Big headache, Till they &quot;enhance&quot; Sky anyway. <BR>  <BR> Phire Phoenix <BR> Human ArchMagi 50th <BR> BristleBane Server <BR>  <BR> Elendel <BR> Newbie Poster  <BR> posted 01-25-2000 03:59 AM            <BR>  <BR> I love that way of breaking fear. I can see someone running to the corner and invis droping and slamming the hot key that /tell's the cleric, &quot;REZ ME NOW!&quot;. Call me strange but this kinda cracks me up. I dont quite think Verant intended for rez to be used in that way but I think it's hilarious.  <BR>  <BR>  <BR> ************** <BR> I am posting this stuff in the hope that Quellious establishes a hold on Fear..all opinions are welcome. <BR> </font><P><font color="#FF0000">.....~Oriz Stormweaver~.....</font><br>
