If that.<br><br>This is a copy of a mail I sent to my guild.  The preamble isn't what is funny.  It's the story on the end.<br><br>Again, most of you will have no idea why this should be funny.  Those of you who get it (or worse, remember it) have obviously been around the 'net for a while.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br><br>Theo<br><br><br><br><!--EZCODE HTML START-->   <HR><!--EZCODE HTML END--><br><br><br>I don't know how many of you are old school online gamers.  I would guess that one or two of you spent time on a MUD or something like that.<br> <br>Once upon a time, 10 years ago or so now, there was a game called XTrek II, which became known as Netrek.  In the olden days, when Microsoft was still butchering things out of the Motif toolkit to create a windowing system with (they butchered and pirated most of their core technologies you know) there was a windowing system (it's still around, much changed since then) called X Windows.  Most X-based programs got to be called xthis or xthat.<br> <br>So there was this game.  And it was a network game.  Yes, UDP, TCP, ICMP, and IP have been around a lot longer than most folks know.<br> <br>It was based on Star Trek in a way.  There were four quandrants to the galaxy.  Romulan, Klingon, Federation, and Orion.  Yes, it was team PvP.  Maximum number of players per team was 8.  There were different ships with different characteristics suited to different purpose.  The battle of the game was in conquering the planets of the other side, and that required lots of tactics and strategies and teamwork in controlling the other side's infrastructure and the like.<br> <br>There was a tactical display, a galactic map, hotkeys, macros, and filter-able chat windows.<br> <br>It was completely client-server, tunable to adjust to whatever lag you might experience.  You could increase or decrease packet updates and such.<br> <br>The server used a shared memory segment to decrease performance impact.  Yes, before Oracle 6.0.36, before relational database management systems.<br> <br>Over time, resourceful people learned to modify the game client to do things it shouldn't.  Like auto tracking and targetting and such.  And so, RSA black box verification was incorporated into the blessed clients.  Yes, RSA.  Before VPN, before cookies, SSL, https,any of that stuff.<br> <br>Yes, most of the cornerstones of &quot;modern&quot; Internet technology rely on elements first practically used in a game.  Written by a bunch of geeks, freely downloadable, no less.<br> <br>It was the first true Internet team sport video game.  It invented it's own jargon, it's own community, it's own personages.<br> <br>A league grew from this.  Yes, the International Netrek League.  And soon, &quot;clue&quot; games were hosted instead of normal pickup games.  Methods to snapshot server status were developped.  Yes, you could actually watch a replay of a game.  Pause, slow motion, read the messages, etc.<br> <br>INL matches were regulation 90 minutes with 30 minute sudden death overtime if required.  As the league grew, fame spread.<br> <br>University of California at Berkeley had one of the strongest Netrek teams in the league.  An accomplishment, considering the league was international and several teams were around.<br> <br>The INL created the INL Council to manage the league, and the office of the INL StatBoy was created.  Over time, sophisticated tracking mechanisms to breakdown a match were created.  Combined with the playback features, you could start to see the the game indeed became more and more sophisticated.  (Sample stats at:  <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.netrek.org/inl/statboy/archives/1994_Fall/official_games/PW.ABCvsHYP">www.netrek.org/inl/statbo...W.ABCvsHYP</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--> and <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.netrek.org/inl/statboy/archives/1993_Fall/XXXXX_HYP_vs_DPS/Conquer">www.netrek.org/inl/statbo...PS/Conquer</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--> )<br> <br>In the Fall '94 INL Season, the UCB Golden Bears were seeded second in the league.  Team Captain of the Golden Bears in that season was Tom Holub, better known as Flt. Adm. Mojo Riser.  Their starting lineup Starbase player was John Morgan Saloman, better known as Fuzzy Bunny.  From their team roster were several of those whom we knew as net.personalities, a term taken from old Usenet newsgroup syntax.  And oddly enough,  their second string Scout Bomber was Captain Dofus, the person whom you all know as Forochel, 24th Season Barbarian Shaman of the Tribunal.<br> <br>That same season, the Sun Microsystems league team Hyperion was led by Team Captain Flt. Adm. Dr. Stupid, whom we affectionally called &quot;Jedi&quot;.  Their first string Starbase, one of the best in the league and one of the developers of the game was Flt. Adm. Shade, whom we affectionally called &quot;Bart&quot;.  And oddly enough, their second string Starbase was Commodore Creeping Death, the person you all know as Théodwyn Riddermark, 52nd Circle Disciple of Quellious.<br> <br>The playoffs that year were great for Hyperion.

I really don't know how funny it is to a non-Netrek person.  Perhaps you could let me know.  If any of you played this game back in the day, I hope you enjoy it (or more likely, remember it).<br> <br><br><!--EZCODE HTML START-->  <HR><!--EZCODE HTML END--><br><br><br>It was a long time before anyone ventured near the rim of the smoking crater. But the suns rose to the middle of the sky, and the people knew that no spirit walked the lands in daylight. Soon enough a brave young one crept to the edge and peered in, and not to be outdone, the rest followed. <br>The air stank of charred earth and melted iron. The quiet click-ping of cooling metal was the only surcease from their breathless silence. <br><br>An awarawk flapped by, awarawking. <br><br>A circle irised open in the top of the strange silver meteor, and before the onlookers could jump back, a head popped out and looked around. Twin oven mitts appeared on each side of the hole and tested the edges as the crowd shrank back in wonder. After a moment, the man levered himself up out of the opening, dusted himself off, slipped off the oven mitts, and threw them to the floor of the crater. &quot;Fucking Erik.&quot; <br><br>His tunic was the color of dark gold, or summer's wheat when threshing time comes. On his right shoulder was a single black square, and his dark hair fell to his shoulderblades. As he looked up, the elders started away -- he had the beard of a priest, but no mustache, and his eyes were brown, not blue. <br><br>&quot;Well howdy,&quot; said the man. <br><br>Uneasy silence. <br><br>&quot;Aw damn. Parlez-vous francais?&quot; <br><br>More silence. The young looked to the elders, pensively. <br><br>&quot;Sprechen zie...fuckit.&quot; <br><br>The man fumbled in his tunic for a moment and came up with a small flat device. Wrestling with it a moment, he folded its lid back, pressed a switch on the side, and pulled out a pen. Looking around for a moment for somewhere to sit, he finally settled down on the floor. <br><br>&quot;Good morning!&quot; said the strange black box. &quot;We have crashed. If you feel you have reached this recording in err--&quot; <br><br>&quot;SHUT the FUCK UP.&quot; The man glanced ruefully at the skitterish spectators above. &quot;Patter level zero.&quot; <br><br>&quot;ackno--&quot; <br><br>&quot;SHUT the FUCK UP. Handwriting recognition maximum.&quot; The man scribbled on the box with the pen, muttering quietly. &quot;Dear...Mojo... no, not Micro, Mojo...have...crashed...on...stupid...fucking...planet... not janet, planet. Looks like...I won't...make...Rigel. Bagel? What the fuck. Rigel. R-i-g-e-l. Yours, me. Okay, now send that on the J band, priority 1.&quot; <br><br>&quot;There's a discount special on the double L band today only for crash messages. Five parsecs just fifteen sixty five,&quot; mentioned the tablet. <br><br>&quot;Did I or did I not say the J band.&quot; <br><br>&quot;It's your money.&quot; <br><br>&quot;SHUT the FUCK UP.&quot; <br><br>&quot;Sent.&quot; <br><br>&quot;Excuse me, sir,&quot; inquired a venturesome young lad from above. &quot;What is that?&quot; <br><br>The man looked up with a sudden beaming smile. &quot;English! SCORE.&quot; <br><br>The child disappeared suddenly behind the fold of an elder's robe, and an unmistakeable whack sounded out, followed by a quiet dull thump. Another elder smiled and shrugged at the newcomer and came forward to the lip of the pit. He bowed. <br><br>&quot;Who are you?&quot; he asked. His blue gown shifted nervously in the wind. <br><br>&quot;Bob Hope.&quot; <br><br>&quot;Ha ha no but seriously.&quot; <br><br>&quot;Aw fuck, you have him in your culture?&quot; <br><br>&quot;_Road to Bali_, the works.&quot; <br><br>&quot;okay, Simon Le Bon.&quot; <br><br>&quot;Loved you in Duran Duran in the 20th century.&quot; <br><br>&quot;Fucking _blojo_ never crashes on the advanced planets. Fucking _blojo_ gets worshipped as a fucking god wherever he fucking goes,&quot; the yellow-clad newcomer bitched. &quot;Okay. Okay. Coriolan.&quot; <br><br>&quot;Welcome to our planet, Coriolan.&quot; <br><br>&quot;Thanks. And you are...&quot; <br><br>&quot;Now get off.&quot; <br><br>&quot;...not exactly extending the peace branch.&quot; <br><br>&quot;Our legends speak of people like you who come from the stars in strange metal spheres.&quot; <br><br>&quot;All lies. We are but peaceful merchants on a diplomatic mission of mercy bearing medical supplies to the needy of the universe.&quot; <br><br>&quot;Even the ones who wear red?&quot; <br><br>&quot;Well no, those are evil swine who repeatedly violate our sacred mission and refuse to accept our benign...&quot; <br><br>&quot;Just as the legends say. You are at war with them.&quot; <br><br>The head-clonked youngster staggered out from behind the robes of an elder, clutching his forehead and whimpering silently. <br><br>&quot;Well,&quot; said Coriolan, &quot;...yeah. But...&quot; <br><br>&quot;Guess how much we want to be involved in an intergalactic war involving two sides of destructive power unimaginable to us.&quot; <br><br>&quot;Not a lot?&quot; <br><br>&quot;Not a lot. And that's why,&quot; said the elder, leaning closer, &quot;it really sucks to be you.&quot; <br><br>Coriolan looked up from the bottom of the pit. &quot;Yeah?&quot; <br><br>&quot;The way I've got it figured, we can't possibly let you live, because you'll be back. And you'll bring others from both sides. And pretty soon, we'll be back in the stone age trying in vain to figure out fire.&quot; <br><br>Coriolan's box chimed. &quot;Boss, 5 minute LL band vox message from Mojo.&quot; <br><br>&quot;speak it,&quot; Coriolan said, looking into the elder's eyes. <br><br>&quot;'You equals a c c plus plus stop. Dooshed erik plus five though stop. Doosh doosh stop. Do I rewl or w...'&quot; <br><br>&quot;Fast forward two minutes.&quot; <br><br>&quot;'...rewling stop. Human highlight film stop.

Regret to inform you that we are not comma repeat not comma going to come rescue your ass stop. Too busy on front stop. Cultivate vegetables comma maybe we'll pick up your grandchildren in four hundred years or so stop.'&quot; <br><br>&quot;Hmmm,&quot; the elder mused, &quot;maybe we won't have to blow you away after all, if your compatriots are to ignore y...&quot; <br><br>&quot;'psych! exclamation point end of file,'&quot; continued the device. <br><br>A giant blinding light suddenly filled the sky, blotting out the twin suns. A roar as of the heavens being ripped open followed, knocking the crowd to its knees. Some staggered to their feet and ran to ramshackle huts at the edge of the clearing. <br><br>Coriolan clambered out of the pit, slipping and falling on the wet grass as the new third sun grew closer and closer, making all the shadows into sharp impenetrable blackness. The youngster who had first spoken was suddenly shouting into his ear. &quot;Take me with you!&quot; <br><br>&quot;What the fuck do you...,&quot; Coriolan began, but the boy was off, running to a hut. The unmistakable hair-raising whine and ozone stench of a laser rifle made Coriolan bellyflop to the ground, shouting instructions to his tablet. &quot;SHIELDS UP!&quot; <br><br>The boy came running back, carrying in his right h and something small and unidentifiable. <br><br>&quot;Personal shields up. Shields 90%. Shields 80%. Shields 74%,&quot; sang the tablet shrilly. <br><br>The third sun touched down and the screaming of its turbines keened down, replaced by the angry shouting of the villagers. A door popped open in its silver side in front of the right engine pod. &quot;Shields 24%.&quot; <br><br>Coriolan pushed the boy into the blackness beyond the door right as the tablet announced, &quot;shields 1%. Our father who...&quot; He dove in, feeling the hot sweep of the invisible lines of death playing against his heels. <br><br>The door slammed shut and the lights came on. A deep, resonant voice announced, &quot;Ship shields up. Shields 100%. Shields 99%. Shields 100%.&quot; <br><br>&quot;Much better,&quot; mentioned Coriolan as he moved to the contoured chair and strapped himself in. The boy stood looking in wonder at the blinking lamps and the camera views of the enraged villagers outside. <br><br>&quot;Shields 99%. Shields 100%. Shields 98%, whoa, a lucky shot. Shields 100%. Retaliate?&quot; <br><br>&quot;Nah. Lift off, prepare for warp 12. Erik's probably fucking carrying again.&quot; Coriolan stowed away the tablet in a drawer and cracked his knuckles. &quot;Oh, kid? Strap yourself into that chair over there..yeah, great.&quot; <br><br>&quot;What is this place, Coriolan?&quot; <br><br>&quot;Welllll I hate to tell you kid but the name's not Coriolan.&quot; <br><br>&quot;Shields 99%. Shields 100%.&quot; <br><br>&quot;No?&quot; asked the youngster, clicking the straps shut. <br><br>&quot;sunscreamer.&quot; <br><br>&quot;The walker of darkness, the bloodstained shadow on the fifth moon, the one who speaks in the clicking tongue of necrotic beetles and whose very touch is the vilest sin.&quot; <br><br>&quot;do the bit about the leaves.&quot; <br><br>&quot;And a thousand black leaves spin around him in a constant whirlwind of death, and his features are a blur behind them; and they guard him from harm and cause him to be absent from the PLACES of harm. FOR HE IS the lord of deceit.&quot; <br><br>&quot;Love that bit.&quot; <br><br>&quot;So you're the one who caused the second Stone Age for our people?&quot; <br><br>&quot;We needed a repair planet. You're not going to hold something five centuries ago against me, are you?&quot; <br><br>&quot;No, I never really got into religion anyway.&quot; <br><br>&quot;Cool, cool.&quot; <br><br>The viewscreen shifted and the villagers suddenly dwindled, disappeared. The plain became a vast terrain, then a continent, then a planet. <br><br>&quot;What does this button do?&quot; inquired the youth, pressing it. <br><br>&quot;ooh, HARDfuckingCORE. Have any loved ones back home?&quot; <br><br>&quot;No, I was an orphan, and everyone hated me.&quot; <br><br>&quot;Well, that's good, because you just...&quot; <br><br>A bubbling mass of bright flashes filled the screen. <br><br>&quot;...instantiated the Third Stone Age,&quot; finished sunscreamer. <br><br>&quot;sucks to be them.&quot; <br><br>&quot;fuckin' a. Anyway, hang on tight, because we're going to have to juke this rom off our backs. Hit that big red button over there, thanks. By the way, what's your name?&quot; <br><br>&quot;It is...was the custom of my people not to hold name until we reach eighteen years of age.&quot; <br><br>&quot;Hmm. Well, what'll I call you. Guest?&quot; <br><br>The boy wrinkled his nose. <br><br>sunscreamer fought the controls of the ship briefly, and then evened them off. &quot;That oughta do it. So what did you go back to your hut to get before you came on board?&quot; <br><br>The boy held up a dirty old stuffed animal. &quot;My favorite thing.&quot; <br><br>&quot;And what a favorite thing it is. Does *IT* have a name?&quot; <br><br>&quot;yeah. It's my fuzzy bunny.&quot; <br><br><br><!--EZCODE HTML START-->   <HR><!--EZCODE HTML END--><br><br><br>The people knew better than to go near the place in the jungle where the meteor had crashed. The tomes warned of the evil horrors that accompanied such portents. The priests, with their turbans, clicked their tongues and sang strange dirges such as they had never before sung. They told of the screamer of stars, and of the melting of the ionosphere which had almost destroyed all the lands. They told of the second coming and the Bristled Lapin who had caused the earth to rise up in lava and claim civilization for the second time before going off to engage in pitched battle. <br><br>But one child was curious, and he snuck away from the teepees of the camp into the depths of the jungle. <br><br>The air stank of charred earth and melted iron. The quiet click-ping of cooling metal was the only surcease from the breathless silence. <br><br>An awarawk flapped by, awarawking. <br><br>The child crept to the edge of the furrowed crater. <br><br>&quot;Is anyone out there?&quot; he heard a voice call. And then, strange and wondrous incantations: &quot;Flowers for the lady! Pizza delivery!
