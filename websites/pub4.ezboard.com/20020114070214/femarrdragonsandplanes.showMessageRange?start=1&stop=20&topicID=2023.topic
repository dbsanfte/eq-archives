<br>
For weeks I have been asking around to try to get us back on the rotation so we could finish up a couple of epics.  Back on the rotation that we originally allowed to happen.<br>
<br>
What response did I get from my good and fair-minded &quot;pals&quot; on the sacred rotation?<br>
<br>
1) it's fucked up that we wanted back in because we said we were done with VS.  The fact that we wanted to do epics didn't mean shit because we gave up all rights when we originally backed out.<br>
<br>
2) if we really wanted back in, we should just KS our way back in because it is doubtful that anyone would let us in nicely and EVERYONE KSes their way in the first time.<br>
<br>
Hmmm... Pretty interesting how quickly things change when it's OUT of game and ON this stupid fucking board.  I guess we are shitbags now because we want to help a few people get epics.  Or is it just that shit like this is only ok when people that aren't in DK/Magister do it? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uaamrieservantoflanys.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aamrie Servant of Lanys</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 92<br> <font color=#E9D756>(6/14/01 6:51:47 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Small problem.</span><hr size=1> Kaane's Quote:After this he pulled the mob and we engaged it before he could get it back to the courtyard.

<br>
Hmmm the original guild that was going after VS failed...sounds like it was a free-for-all to me...and if they pulled..why did you and your guild try to KS? Guide will tell you that if the mob hits you first its yours..or well they use..things change with time. So if Koryo pulled..it meant that VS hit and aggro'd on him and you was KSing..<br>
<br>
If it wasnt your "rotation" then why the whine fest..? <br>

I dont care how many epics you still have to complete, you dont have to be dicks about it.<br>

And dont give the BS that no one has ever let you back in, cause I never have gotten a tell.<br>

If VS is up, the correct &quot;rotation&quot; guild had better make sure they are on site and fully buffed and kill him.<br>
<br>
Does anyone actually think that the whole server is aware of this &quot;rotation&quot;?  What are you going to do if, say, if an Asian guild just happens to be on when VS pops and sees him there?  If the guild who's &quot;turn&quot; it is isn't there ASAP and engaging, the MOB will (and should) go to the other guild.<br>
<br>
The concept of a &quot;rotation&quot; is nothing more than a loose agreement between a small circle of people.  There are literally thousands of others who don't even know it exists.<br>
<br>
If the guild whose turn it is failed and gave up, and VS is sitting there alive, then it SHOULD be that whoever shows up ready gets him.<br>
<br>
Given that scenario, and the fact that Kaane is admitting that Koryo pulled, we are the ones who should be pissed that someone attempted to KS us. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uealan01.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ealan01</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 137<br> <font color=#E9D756>(6/14/01 7:04:21 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Small problem.</span><hr size=1> Damn...

Hey Pank, did you even read my posts?  I asked members of Umoja, UI, Storm's Fury, MS and Affliction and was told the same fucking thing everytime... Dun know... sorry... YOU guys (guess we ARE Da`Kor still, huh?) gave up YOUR spot (hmmm... there it goes again) so you are SHIT OUT OF LUCK...  that's VERBATIM dude.  What would you do, exactly?  How many people would you beg to be allowed to kill a MOB that you were killing before anyone was bothering to attempt it?<br>
<br>
To add insult to injury, I was told &quot;if you want in the rotation, you really have to demonstrate the ability to do it by taking a spot&quot;  What kind of fucking &quot;rotation&quot; is this that it is only &quot;nice and friendly&quot; on this board?  You guys had better get your shit together because as of right now, this is how the rotation works:<br>
<br>
New Guild &quot;Hi, can we be in the rotation?&quot;<br>
Guild1 &quot;Heh, we are too greedy to let ya, better ask Guild2&quot;<br>
Guild2 &quot;ask Guild3&quot;<br>
Guild3 &quot;ask Guild4&quot;<br>
Guild4 &quot;ask MS&quot;<br>
MS &quot;oh christ already&quot;<br>

Don't start this shit with how friendly the rotation is and how easy it is to get on.  Didn't Affliction have to KS Umoja to get on the Trak rotation?

I am aware of how the rotation works and IT WAS OUR TURN. I dont give a rats ass about the mob itself, there will be another, but you dont attack a mob when there is another guild that has gotten there before you.<br>
<br>
We were sitting before his room buffing when he pulled. I tried to have a civilized dialog with Koryo but he just blew me off and pulled him anyway.<br>

I didn't come up or want a stupid fucking rotation.  As I have heard from Da`kor members, &quot;If you want in the rotation ask the current guild who is up and kill the mob.  If you kill the mob you get in the rotation if you fail you don't plain and simple.&quot;  Is it my fault that VS is a one week spawn so it makes who ever is up to bat feel like its been a year since they had their vs?  No..  I didn’t come up with the rotation and i can tell you right now the rotation was made with the foresight that DK, MS and SF would be the only ones in the rotation.  When other guilds got powerful you guys got stumped and probably just said &quot;if you kill it whenever you can be in the rotation&quot; because you didn't know you were going to leave the rotation in the future.<br>

As for affliction having to ks umoja to get in.  After training trak and 2 more failed attempts i think they got him the next day because after the KS attempt umoja just got too tired to continue.  The next day we didn't have enough on for trak. <p>Pankeleonn.  Putting the "Man" in "Mancheese"

Had they killed him, they would've been given a spot in the rotation.  They tried 4 times.  When they gave up, we moved in for the kill.  It was, after all, United Independent's turn in the loose rotation agreement the top guilds have for Trakanon and VS.<br>
<br>
Magister is as much Da`Kor as United Independent is Umoja.  Magister has had to start over much the way UI did.  Had Magister said they'd like a chance at VS, we would've given him to them providing we didn't already have a prior agreement with another guild and we weren't already there buffing and ready to pull.<br>
<br>
Magister came into zone when we were two minutes away from pulling.  Only thing left to do was speed the tanks and med up.  Koryo was a complete asshole.  Came into the room and pulled right through our group.  <br>
<br>
No negotiating...  No respect for anybody else...  He walks in, spouts off, trains our raid, and takes our mob.  All that preparation for nothing.<br>
<br>
Then Ealan has the nerve to come here and say we tried to steal their pull?!  It was OUR raid before they even showed up!  <br>
<br>
*sigh*  Enaak tries his hardest to lead our guild with integrity and respect.  I guess it's too much to expect the same from other guilds.  <br>

<br>
Kaane's Quote as well:After this he pulled the mob and we engaged it before he could get it back to the courtyard. We had only like 15 and had zero buffs so we failed. Afterwards he got up and pulled back to his force. They killed him and left.<br>
<br>
Now I am confused. If UI was TWO minutes away from pulling; then there shouldnt have been a problem with defeating VS. But PLEASE show me a mana based class that can med to full in two minutes..I sure as hell cant. My int is 204 with +210 mana items. It takes me longer than two minutes. And in your first post, you said that you had zero buffs, but then in the second all you had left to do was speed and med. So which is it hun? Its always best to make sure your story is straight before repeating it alot.  This saves you from looking like an ass.<br>
