<br>
You come to a point where you have to fight Shin (the 5th in 5 consecutive Boss fights with no levelling/OD filling time in between), but it's by no means a regular fight.  He has 140k HP and you must defeat him in very few attacks or he swallows your party for a &quot;Game Over&quot;.<br>
<br>
This may sound like no big deal but I screwed up early on and I cannot get past it.<br>
<br>
I'm pretty sure that the reason(s) I can't beat him can be pinned down to one or two things, namely that I never levelled Lulu up very much, and I never played Blitzball to get Wakka's OD attack up, either (I don't like the Blitzball game at all).  On a side note I also never found more than one of the spheres to up Auron's OD attack.<br>
<br>
I've tried several ways of fighting this final Shin confrontation and the closest I've come is taking him down to about 15k HP. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
Here's my best attack sequence:<br>
<br>
Formation of Yuna, Tidus and Lulu.<br>
<br>
#1 Yuna throws Blizzara for 3K<br>
#2 Tidus Hastes Yuna<br>
#3 Lulu uses her pitiful OD as no one else has the range to attack.  She does a whopping 1,500 damage. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   (she doesn't even have the -ga series of nukes, she's still on the -ra stuff)<br>
#4 Yuna throws Blizarra for 3k, then summons Bahmut and I have him Boost himself.<br>
<br>
At this point Shin pulls us in 1 notch and he's in Aeon OD range.<br>
<br>
#5 Bahmut OD's for 36k<br>
#6 Sin nukes for about 2k<br>
#7 Bahmut Armor Breaks for 3k<br>
#8 Bahmut attacks for 3.5k<br>
#9 Bahmut attacks for 3.5k<br>
#10 Bahmut attacks for 3.5k<br>
<br>
Now Shin pulls us in to close range.<br>
<br>
#11 Shin nukes Bahmut for 1.5k, filling Bahmut's OD Gauge<br>
#12 Bahmut OD's for 39k<br>
#13 Dismiss Bahmut<br>
#14 Yuna Grand Summons Bahmut<br>
#15 Bahmut OD's for 39k, topping off Shin's OD Gauge<br>
<br>
#16 Shin sucks my peeps into oblivion with a measly 15k HP left.<br>
<br>
Even if I could use someone else's OD from the long range at the start it would do me no good as none of my characters (with the exception of Yuna, of course) have an OD attack worth more than 2.5k (Auron).  With Lulu's power and OD both being so weak, compounded by the fact she's the only one that can OD attack from the long range... I'm screwed.<br>
<br>
Lulu was so low on HP from the start that I got frustrated with her being such a Pheonix Down/Life junkie.  When I got Yuna the Blizarra ability and she could hit as well as Lulu with it I pretty much shelved Lulu from that point on.  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  Big</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> mistake.<br>
<br>
At this point the only way I could possibly beat Shin would be to squeeze 4 OD attacks out of Bahmut, and there is just no way that can happen.  I can't even get him to do 3 of them sometimes (if Shin wusses out and doesn't nuke him both times or hard enough both times then Bahmut's OD Gauge never tops off before it's too late).<br>
<br>
---------------------------------------<br>
<br>
This story has several morals:<br>
<br>
- Don't shelve Lulu.  Put up with her frailty as long as you have to to get her upped both in OD attack capability and get her the good nukes (the -ga series and Grav).  I have no idea how much damage Grav does, but I imagine that using it in her OD might make her OD worth around 10k.<br>
<br>
- Up Yuna to an insane point to get Bahmut even more powerful. I'm not sure on this one... Bahmut may be capped at 39k for his OD attack.  If he's not, however, getting him to a 50k OD would cut shin to 40k while at the middle range using his natural OD and Yuna's Grand Summoning.<br>
<br>
- When you take the Airship back to Zanarkand to get your Trial treasure (and what a nice piece of gear that is!) also detour to get Auron's other 2 OD spheres.<br>
<br>
- If you can put up with Blitzball up Wakka's OD as much as you can as he can atack from the middle range in the Shin fight.<br>
<br>
- No matter how scary the prior Boss fights get DO NOT use Auron's OD attack as he seems to get bumped out of attacking quite a bit and you may not have time to regen it (don't know why, but it seems his attack turn gets skipped a lot in those 4 fights, even if you have him hasted).  Save it for using on Shin at close range.<br>
<br>
- ? Maybe ? rotate Yuna out of the fight after Bahmut uses his natural OD at the middle range point.  This way as soon as Auron uses his OD at close range you can rotate her back in for the Grand Summoning to finish Shin off, sneaking in that kick-butt OD when Shin's Gauge is nearly full.<br>
<br>
-----------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
As it is, I'm lucky enough to still have a save point from before the first 4 Boss fights.  Well, I say that's lucky because it gives me the chance to go grab Auron's spheres and painfully level Lulu up.  Yuna will also level along the way for sure as she'll be babysitting Lulu's HP.  It's definitely unlucky in that I have to refight the first 4 bosses in that round again when I'm ready, just to get back to where I'm stuck right now.<br>
<br>
Since Lulu is so far behind everyone I may just start the game over from scratch.  I didn't understand the Sphere Grid at first anyway and made some bad choices for other characters, too.  Starting over would give me the chance to build up everyone the right way and keep them all abreast of eachother, and also allow me to find all of the Al-Bhed Primer Volumes and Auron's spheres.  /sigh<br>

You know that if you just make Lulu do one thing in the fight and then immediately bench them, they still get exp, and the exp (apparently) isn't divided between the other characters.  Now, it was hard as hell to make complete sense of what your saying, but if you can leave this battle and get back on the airship, theres no way you need to start over, leveling isn't that hard.  Since your relying on magic so heavily, I'm guessing you didn't get any epic weapons or you just cant hit that hard with the physical based characters.  But if somehow you got Yuna to get a black spell w/o using a blk. magic orb,  then i must agree, you did fuck something up.<br>
<br>
Leaving people on the bench is no biggie.  Just because you have some inactive character that lags behind dosen't mean that much, just filter them in, use some action, then filter out.  I say this knowing that my Kimahri now blows, because i made him go get ultima, and hes just know started back on wakka's path (he has no real path unlike the other characters) but now, hes just a little weaker then tidus/auron.<br>
<br>
Since you whipping out bahamut in your time of need, I'm guessing you dont have any of the optional summons either.  You need them.<br>
<br>
If you can avoid this fight and level/get items, i highly recommend it.  Explore the world, theres a whole lotta stuff in it.<br>
<br>
I would change the name of your post, i dont think people that are just starting to play FF X should read it, it still is kinda a spoiler, that, and from the way you worded it, it would be very hard to learn from your mistakes. <p><BR>

Azuza says &quot;get an optional Aeon&quot;, an then Solanthius says &quot;you're relying too much on Aeons&quot;. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Btw: I did the optional Temple for the Aeon not knowing the monetary aspect of it.  I was *quite* short of the mark and never went back to get it.  Thanks for reminding me - think I'll go get him now. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I agree that there probably is more than one way to do it, with or without multiple Aeon OD's.  That's why in my &quot;morals&quot; I not only mentioned levelling Yuna up, but also getting Lulu's, Auron's and Wakka's OD attacks increased.<br>
<br>
I see the point of not starting over, but I still haven't decided what I want to do.  Lulu is soooo far behind everyone, and swapping her out of battle isn't always easy.  You know how it goes (even early in the game): Auron slashes for 500, Yuna Cures Auron for 235, Lulu nukes the beastie for 615 and the beasties pulls a flying hooyah on Lulu for 1,200 when she only has 900 HP in the first place.<br>
<br>
Can't exactly swap her then.  Pheonix her, then in her &quot;waiting&quot; turn - BOOM - another flying hooyah. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Guess I'll try to level her up at everyone else's current pace but I expect it will take quite some time and a LOT of rezzes.<br>
<br>
As far as the &quot;epic&quot; weps go I don't remember the names offhand and most of them have changed names as I've customized them.  Auron uses one that has Zombie Touch, First Strike, Counter Strike and 1/2 MP cost.  Yuna uses a Rod with First Strike, 1/2 MP cost and one other thing.  Tidus uses a sword with First Strike, Counter Strike, 5% HP and 10% STR on it.  Lulu has a whole basket of Mogs but the one she uses most has Zombie Touch on it.  The last two are weak: Kimari has a customized Knight Lance and Wakka has a customized Rematch.<br>
<br>
-----------------------------------------<br>
<br>
On a side note I don't think this is a spoiler at all.  Knowing how one person <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> failed</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> to win a fight is a sharing of information.  Telling people how to beat it, as in you've already beat it <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> , would be a spoiler.  The whole point of my original post was only to show the importance of keeping every character active, level them beyond what you think should be the norm, and go out of your way (especially using the Airship) to go and get those items you never got around to.  Again, I don't see this as a spolier at all.  For me the realization I came to tonight was an absolute letdown, and I don't fancy backtracking for everything I need.  I seriously doubt anyone else would enjoy this either, and maybe now they won't have to. <p>Nalias<br>

I was at that exact point and he did his auto-death thing, but I went and did about every side quest and then came back and killed him. How I did it : Used Tidus' Hastega on Yuna and Lulu, and had them both cast Ultima until his meter was full so I knew he was going to do Giga-Gravitron. I had Yuna's overdrive meter full beforehand so I used Anima's overdrive and it did 34k of damage overkill :P Yuna and Lulu had their ultimate weapons which make their spells cost 1 mp so casting consecutive Ultimas wasn't a problem either. BTW if you ever hope to get Wakka's last 3 overdrives and his ultimate weapon you should learn to like blitzball, you have to play about 15 hours of it. I'm not exaggerating either. <br>
<br>
There are 3 optional aeons, Yojimbo is probobly the least usfull in this fight anyway. Wakka is crap in this battle, really, and Auron is naturally slower due to lack of speed spheres in his track (unless yo useriously move him around) You really have to rely on magic or aeons to do the magic here. Really, you can't use aeons too much, their overdrives charge up fast as hell, I charged up all of them to beat a few battles (The 3rd Seymour and the 3rd Yunalescia come to mind) If you're not buff enough for the Omega Ruins yet, do some leveling in Mount Gagazet or Zanarkand Ruins/The Dome. Just switch out Lulu so she doesn't die, if you truly havn't used her alot she should get lots more sphere levels. <p><BR>
