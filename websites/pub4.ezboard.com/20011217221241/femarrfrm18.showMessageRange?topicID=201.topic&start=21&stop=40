Oh, and like Arikel, despite my left wing stance, I'm currently fairly impressed with George Jnr's handling of the situation. It's going to be a very narrow line, that needs be drawn to achieve the best outcome, tools such as warfare are very blunt, but likely have to be used. I'm kinda holding my breath in trepidation about what's likely to happen now, but based on the limited information of the situation I have, I think the decision makers have acted sensibly and avoided rash mistakes (other than .. was it an the Italian foreign minister or prime minister or something? who made some totally outrages comments about Islam). <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/usmashgnome.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Smashgnome</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 268<br> <font color=#E9D756>(10/7/01 7:56:35 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> reply to Aishen</span><hr size=1> Haha Aishen, I read your &quot;FUCK YOU&quot; post, it really did tell me enough about you to realize what kind of person that I am dealing with, a very bitter individual..

In fact the extremely poor argumantation has made me ill.<br>
<br>
Although there is little good arguing here, I will just critique the worst offender:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>

And on and on saying nothing, but trying to build a possion of intelectual authority, and failing.<br>
<br>
Okay, an emotional outburst lacking reason and full of assumption (stereotypes too, but that is neither here nor there)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>

No, you didn't make any points about it.  You mentioned it, but there was point, and it didn't support your main point, whatever that is.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>

How is 'whining liberal bleeding-heart' a stereotype when 'liberals' is not.  I'm not saying there isn't a difference, maybe there is, but what is it?<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>

What does this mean?  The first part could have been a argument supporting your contention about stereotypes, but the last part validates the stereotypes of conservative and liberal.  If they aren't stereotypes, what are they?  And how can a 'viewpoint' that is, or appears to be, the viewpoint of a group that you seem to insist are not stereotypes not represent the majority? If that appears to be what the 'group' believes, it must be the majority oppinion.<br>
<br>
Again a list of contentions with no argumentation, or evidence.<br>
<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>

Your outright refusal to even recognize an opposing viewpoint for what it is, never mind actually considering it's possible validity, makes you more of a pain in the ass than you're worth. Keep on trollin'.<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
I was going to attack these statements, but my intention was not to debate the arguments, but to critique the arguing. So, I will sum it up with 'hypocrite.'<br>
<br>
This started out with an attack on an argument, which misfired then turned into the coward's retreat: running away, thumbing your nose, yelling 'nyeah,  nyeah, you suck.'  While trying to claim intellectual, and moral, superiority. Yet there is no valid argumentation in anything you have said, and you still haven't entered the gravitational pull of a point.<br>
<br>
Your next post had some validity, but it lacks foundation being based on the previous posts.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>

There you go. A point, hidden, but there.<br>

That's not simplification, it's entirely wrong.

Well stated, and stays on task. reference to previous statments is always a good thing, as long as you support the what was originally said, if you have to modify the statment in any way, or have to start with 'you didn't understand' it is best to just drop the argument, you've already lost. Don't move back, move forward.  This si a definate step forward, and weakens your aponents position.<br>
You are implying a secondary contention here that you never stated. You should always state a contention, something like, 'The true height of Rome preceded the Caesars,' which was seems to be implied. If that was not what you meant then you can see how that weakens the argument, especially because your rebutle would probably start 'You didn't understand.' In an argument, my failure to understand is your fault, not mine.<br>

I have no doubt that your arguments were based in fact, and I have no doubt that some one with similar knowledge could have refuted everything you said, pity no one could, it would have been a stimulating debate.<br>

BTW how you feel about Caesar, the Senate, or when Rome reached its pinnacle don't matter. A good debater can successfully argue in favor of something they don't believe in. Again, I am only comment on style, not the actual arguments, I really don't know enough about Rome to do that.<br>

The purpose of debate is to express oposing viewpoints, if your point is not understood that is your fault, and, if you choose to pursue the point, it becomes your responsibility to clarify it (That's why in formal debate there is always a period of questions).  If you choose not to clarify the point, you loose the argument. You may believe you won, but the goal was to demonstrate the validity of a viewpoint, if the viewpoint is not understood, you have failed.<br>
Every person you talk to comes with bias and perseption. Perception *is* reality, to each individual. In a debate, or argument, you have to pierce that reality to introduce a new perspective, if you don't do that, you have failed. <br>
The only way to do that, unless you already share the perspective, is with a persission of comunication.  If the person you are trying to convince does not understand you, you have failed, and your choices are to give up or to clarify what you have said.<br>

This, at least has been on the news, a few times, but what is your point? How does this support anything you are saying? This is nothing more than a sound bite.<br>

It is an example of a conservative administration taking an action that was dubious at best.  Granted, their hearts were in the right place, but look where this action has gotten us?  This supports my point that conservatives are not inherently smarter, better, or more moral than liberals, and that the repeated attacks on this board toward liberals in general are unwarranted.

No, it is not.  It is a factual statement.  Prince Valiant is a representation of pure goodness and saintliness that many Americans are familiar with.  Again, I'm using hyperbole.  In plain and simple english, I'm saying here that conservatives are not infallible and have in fact conservatives (_some_ conservatives, if you really want to split hairs) have committed morally unsavory acts.  I suppose this is a bit subjective, given the nature of morality, but I think it would be a rather ridiculous stretch to state that no conservative has _ever_ used poor moral judgement.  I refer you to the Iran-Contra affair of the '80s, as well as Nixon's dragging of feet in getting us out of Vietnam.<br>

The stereotype of the whining liberal bleeding-heart is just that: a stereotype. Characterizing all liberals ...<br>
<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
<br>
How is 'whining liberal bleeding-heart' a stereotype when 'liberals' is not. I'm not saying there isn't a difference, maybe there is, but what is it?<br>
<br>
'Liberals' is not a stereotype.  It refers to individuals who hold a set of general political beliefs.  I'll summarize them by saying these beliefs generally include a desire to move away from the status quo and &quot;old ways&quot; of doing things, and a government that is more elaborate and involved, using federal and state programs to help enrich the lives of citizens.  This is a grossly simplified version of liberal political beliefs, but I think it'll suffice for the purposes of this arguement.  It is not a stereotype because it is based upon factual information about people's political beliefs, and despite a certain amount of subjectivity it is more or less agreed upon by most people.  This includes the people it refers to.  The Democratic party is a pretty good example of a group considered liberal, though it is not the only one by far.  Now, within the context it is used in this thread, the phrase 'whining liberal bleeding heart' is a stereotype.  It is a blanket reference based upon a minimum of factual information, instead exaggerating traits of the group in question to the point that the phrase misleads more than it enlightens.  Perhaps more to the point, the phrase is intended to give insult rather than to accurately describe the group in question.  It's a lot like the phrase 'lazy niggers'.  While it is true that there are black people who are lazy, the phrase is not intended to convey an accurate picture of the people in question.  It is intended to convey a deragatory and misleading impression.<br>

<br>
What does this mean? The first part could have been a argument supporting your contention about stereotypes, but the last part validates the stereotypes of conservative and liberal. If they aren't stereotypes, what are they? And how can a 'viewpoint' that is, or appears to be, the viewpoint of a group that you seem to insist are not stereotypes not represent the majority? If that appears to be what the 'group' believes, it must be the majority oppinion.<br>
<br>
Again a list of contentions with no argumentation, or evidence.<br>
<br>
<br>
Read it again, carefully.  I'm not talking about viewpoints held by the majority of a group, you would be correct if I were.  I am talking about viewpoints held by individuals who are part of or associated with a group.  For example, I hold the viewpoint that broccoli tastes pretty bad.  I don't think one could accurately state that this viewpoint is representative of liberals, internet users, video gamers, college students, or any other group of which I might accurately be considered a part.  OK, if you consider people who dislike broccoli a group then you could, but that's hardly relevant.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

It has to do with what I have gathered of Mec from this and other posts of his, specifically that he is an educated man who values both learning and thinking skills.  His statements in favor of willfully using stereotype to simplify information seems to me to be antithetical to the values he appears to hold.  If I've misunderstood Mec's views he can feel free to correct me.  My point was to get him to address this apparent contradiction, and I again used hyperbole to get my point across.

When? where? how? And I still don't know what a liberal is in your definition.<br>

<br>
See my rough definition of a liberal, above.  Historically, we can go back to the Vietnam war for starters.  Despite my opinions of that particular war, the fact is that it was waged by a liberal administration who weren't afraid to get tough in order to stand up for their morals.  I can't honestly offer up many other recent examples, as my forte lies more with ancient history than modern history.  However, I think that the founding fathers of this country, Alexander the Great, and society of ancient Babylon could all accurately be considered liberal by today's standards.  I wouldn't say they lacked resolve, or the ability to get things done when they needed to.  If Mec's statements about modern liberals hold true, then they must hold true for others with similar viewpoints.  They don't.<br>

<br>
Again you do have me on a technicality, I should have said 30-40 years.  This is another Vietnam reference.  Liberals have made a poor showing in post-Vietnam America.  I attribute this to a few different factors, primary among them being the failure of the ultra-liberal counterculture and the resentment toward the Democratic party over the war.  Not many Americans hold this against the Democrats today, but the anger of past generations of potential liberal voters seem to have pushed them toward a more passive modus operandi than the Republican party.  This has allowed Republican candidates to cultivate a tougher image than their competitors and create a perception among many citizens of liberal weakness.  I don't believe that this perception is accurate, for reasons detailed above and in previous posts.<br>

This started out with an attack on an argument, which misfired then turned into the coward's retreat: running away, thumbing your nose, yelling 'nyeah, nyeah, you suck.' While trying to claim intellectual, and moral, superiority. Yet there is no valid argumentation in anything you have said, and you still haven't entered the gravitational pull of a point.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Your critique is innacurate, as I have demonstrated.  Nice try, though.<br>
<br>
Your next post had some validity, but it lacks foundation being based on the previous posts.<br>

That doesn't make us angels though, and to refuse to accept this is arrogant. I'm glad some folks are aware of the facts, and while I don't believe that a peaceful solution is possible I respect the opinions of those who do.<br>

There you go. A point, hidden, but there.<br>
This was great, contention, argument, evidence. Pity it wasn't part of your debate, but was agreeing with someone else's point.<br>

As for the rest of this garbage, you are evading valid arguments trying to convince us that they are invalid only because you say so.<br>
<br>
<br>
That is, quite frankly, bullshit.  The information is here, if you refuse to accept it I cannot be held responsible for that.  There's not much I can really say to such a completely erroneous statement.<br>

Typo aside, this was arogant, condescending, and incorrect. You have owned no one. Sad too. <br>
<br>
<br>
'Pwned' is an internet slang term, derived I believe from a popular typo of 'owned'.  It is used on purpose.  Check out a PvP server board such as the Tallon Zek Times or it's parody board, Melvin Zek Times, for examples of it's use.  Indecentally, given the tone and content of your posts you are in no position to sermonize about either typos, arrogance, or condecension. <p>Arikel Callistrae <BR>

No one actually agrees with Bin Laden's actions, at least no one outside his particular brand of Muslim fanaticism.<br>

How do you know that? There may be people who do agree with his actions. <br>
<br>

You got me on this one, that's true. I used hyperbole, and that's sort of weak when arguing with an unfamiliar opponent. That sentence should have read &quot;Virtually no one actually agrees...&quot;. I base this on personal experience. I know a lot of people, online and IRL, and I've examined the ideas of a couple groups who are pushing for peace in the Mideast. None of them agree with Bin Laden's actions. You are correct that there may be some few who do.<br>
<br>
Rereading this, I have to add that this statement was made in my flame toward the initial poster.  Your critique of it is flawed, as you are applying the standards of debate to it rather than the standards of an internet flame.  I should also add that this is the only instance where I feel my use of hyperbole has been sufficiently misleading as to warrant criticism.<br>

I find it laughable that college students really believe that they could have all of the answers to the world's problems by listening to their professor and reading the book that he wrote.  Universities used to be institutions where people could develop their own opinions based upon how they reacted to the information given to them.  Unfortunately that does not work when you are only given one piece of all the information pertaining to a particular subject.  If students could manage to shift their focus from getting good grades towards developing an understanding of how things work then they would be better off.  A college degree is only a piece of paper if you did not bother to form your own opinions while you were in the pursuit of it.   <br>

What are the standards of internet flame? To be as ignorant and abusive as possible? Then it wasn't a verry good flame, I'm sure you can be more abusive than that. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Unfortunately, you continued to build on the flame instaed of retracting it and restating your position. You even tried to defend it by calling it a flame. If you admit fault, people are more likely to listen. If you defend an obvious mistake, especially by accusing others of comprehending it, you come across as believing that you are never wrong. Everything you say is colored by what was said previously, as that is all the audience has to judge you by. <br>
Trying to support a flame, while excusing it as just a flame, seems irrational.  You should have started over.<br>
I admit, when reading your posts independantly, they were much more valid. However, in the course of an argument, it makes more sense to view them as a whole.<br>

This, however you look at it, was nothing more than childish. You can never declare yourself the winner of an argument, and if you ever feel the need to, you've probably lost.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uaishen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aishen</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 602<br> <font color=#E9D756>(10/10/01 11:12:16 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://ourworld.cs.com/nimue321/aishy.jpg width=78 height=156></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Why college classes are not the answer</span><hr size=1> Oh, good god, another gimp who knows everything.
