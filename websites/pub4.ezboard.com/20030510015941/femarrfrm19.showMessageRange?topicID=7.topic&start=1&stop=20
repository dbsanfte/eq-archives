<br>
Just wondering how everyone who is playing DAOC thinks it will be doing in 6 months. Or a year. I remember people in the testing stages initially saying it was awesome etc etc and then when it goes live where are they? They're playing EQ.  It looks ok to me. Good graphics. Ok class system. Piss poor combat/pulling system. I really think within 6 months you'll see a solid 50% of the people who have left EQ back. DAOC is new, but as a certain math wizard pointed out, people said AO, D2, Asheron's Call, etc etc etc were going to take EQ's fanbase as well, when in fact they didn't even dent it. Just want to know what you folks in DAOC are really expecting from the game, and if you think you are really done with EQ or if you'll be back in the next little while. Lets try to keep it civil as long as possible too =)<br>

I thought it was the second coming... but it's been two years.<br>
<br>
As far as DAoC goes, there's a small vigilant fanbase, but I don't think it'll last as long... from what I've seen, it's EQ lite, and it might get people's attention for a few months, but like AO (that game drove me nuts after a week), it'll lose its appeal.<br>
<br>
That's what I'm assuming... but every time I see it in the mall, I stare at it and go hmmmmm... maybe I should try it.<br>
<br>

Its more of EQ done better. But basically the same game at the beginning stages.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Ok class system&quot;<br>
<br>
  In my opinion you could not be further from correct. The class system in DAoC is great. Each class adds somthing to a group no matter what they specialize in. In EQ a monk is a monk. They may have taken different starting stats but after that they all get the same skills as they level. Now you can choose whether you want a human or a lizzie. <br>
<br>
 In DAoC that healer can specialize in pacification, augmentation, or mending. A healer swho does mending heals the best, a healer who does pacificatin mezzes the best, a healer who does augmentation bufs the best, one who does some of each does good in all but not best.<br>
<br>
 I play a warrior, I chose to specialize in sword and sheild with a little parry thrown in. another warrior may choose to do hammer and only parry so he can use 2 handed hammers. see where I am going with this.<br>
<br>
&quot;Piss poor combat/pulling system&quot;<br>
<br>
How do you get this? The game is set up that you can solo to 50 with any character you choose. Grouping gets you there faster. Try soloing to 50 in EQ how many classes can do that?<br>
<br>
Pulling sucks? are you reffering to BAF (Bring a freind) code? where the game gives your party the appropriate amount of mobs to fight for your level and number in your group? Or does your group of 8 want to beat up on a mob you could easily solo yourself?<br>
<br>
The quest system in DAoC is well desgined. You talk to somone they send you out to kill somthing, you return the item they send you someplace else. there is a task system where you talk to a guard and they ask you to go kill somhitng and come back. Multi layers or quests where you need to complete one quest to do another. Its much better than I can make it out to be.<br>
<br>
Tradeskills are actually worth doing, while player made armor is better than store bought armor. YOu can actually make cash at these tradeskills. How many people wore banded armor at 50 in EQ?<br>
<br>
 The biggest hurdle DAoC needs to overcome is the serious lack of reason to PVP. as it stands right now there are relics in forts that you can go out and take over. IMO the implentation of the fronteirs is crappy. Wandering Uber mobs that you have to worry about when you want to go kill some enemy realmers etc.<br>
<br>
 Another thing I did not like in beta was the death system over 30 was heinous ( did I spell that right?) dying once after 30 set you back hours of work. Way too high a penalty.<br>
<br>
<br>
Until you get to 50 your just in the character development phase, alot shorter time period that EQ is. How fun Mythic can make the RVR will either make or break the game. I quit EQ over 9 months ago now, Do I miss it? HELL NO. Am I having fun playing DAoC with my homies? HELL YES! Will I stay in DAoC? not likley once my turn in the SB beta starts. and Unless that sucks ass(which I highly doubt) Thats where I will be going.<br>
<br>
<br>
 So in conclusion I thnk DAoC is better than EQ but just barely. <br>
<br>
Will DAoC put EQ out of business? No. <br>
<br>
Will some people like DAoC better? Yes. <br>
<br>
Will some people come back to EQ? Yes <br>
<br>
Will some people stay in DAoC? Yes.<br>
<br>
<br>
Hope this answers some of your questions.<br>

<br>
I agree here.  Especially anyone who says D2 can take away any noticiable ammount of people from EQ, they have no idea what they are talking about.  D2 is -NO- comparison to EQ.<br>
<br>
AO - If AO didn't completely and utterly fuck up their first few weeks of release maybe things would be different, I dunno.  I found some things very interesting about the game but could never stay connected long enough to find them out.<br>
<br>
As far as DAoC's lifespan... It depends. They DO have a solid game built here in a lot of respects.  It all comes down to will there be enough added to keep it interesting at a high level.  Will the PvP they have laid out be good enough - I think it will be for a while.<br>
<br>
For the future? I dunno.  A lot depends on the player base and how they play the PvP.  I think it will be a lot of fun, but no idea how long it will be.<br>
<br>
The game definalty has potentional to be lasting and I hope Mythic takes advantage of that and does something to keep the game interesting for a long time.<br>
<br>
I must say, no game has sparked my interest as much as EQ.  I don't know why, if I did I could explain it and come up with concepts for a better game.  But I don't know.  EQ just did a lot of things right, much more than people give them credit for.<br>
<br>
I am not worried about DAoC not being fun forever, I'm just looking at it now, where I am having fun and playing with friends.  Who knows, it a few months it might get boring, but they have definalty built a fun game for the present.<br>
<br>
Instead of everyone asking &quot;how long will DAoC keep pepole away from Everquest&quot;, the more interseting question would be &quot;What does Everquest have that the others don't?&quot;<br>
<br>
I have tried to answer that question many times.  I come up with a lot of answers sometimes; but none ever seem specific enough to implement into something new.<br>
<br>
So I don't know.  I am not even going to bother comparring games again for a while, because right now I am having fun in DAoC, and I am going to face content/lasting questions when they actually arise. <p>Tuan<br><a href="http://www.dakor.net">Da`Kor</a>

Read that list, I don't see how anyone can say DAoC has bad classes and a piss poor combat system, there are some great things they have done.<br>
<br>
One of the best (which EQ should have done 2 friggin years ago and the game would have been a god) is to let people specilize in certain abilites and actually get new things (no not the stupid spell casting spec that EQ did, that was worthless).<br>
<br>
People can actually be unique.  I play a healer and can put points into different specalizations to get new spells and to be better at something than another...<br>
<br>
This actually seperates peoples character abilites to make them unique and what they want, instead of completely generic like EQ.<br>
<br>
Put some of the new ideas in DAoC with EQ and you would get an awsome game. <p>Tuan<br><a href="http://www.dakor.net">Da`Kor</a>

<br>

I gotta say that those wizards are powerful mofo's.  And those monks.  Jeez, need to nerf them bad boys.  Nothing like having an asskickin melee healer with ressing capability, lol.  Paladins are still gay...Nothing new there.  From what I've read, seen, &amp; heard about the RvR system, it is fun as hell.  Mass carnage with nothing to lose except some time.  For such a new game, I'm completely impressed with how it turned out.  Granted I've come across a few issues, but nothing a bit of technical help couldn't handle.<br>
<br>
I personally love the questing ethics this game has.  No more camping for so&amp;so mob.  You can have several people doing the same quest at once &amp; the final mob is up.  If you are all grouped together, then you will all finish the quest upon getting so&amp;so item off so&amp;so mob.<br>
<br>
Traveling by foot does suck.  It's long &amp; annoying, but EQ was the same way.  Being able to Rent-a-Ass(horse) was pretty cool.  It's like the olden day style of a New York Taxi service.  You see them goin by all day long.  Even undriven horses goin by, but they never stop, hehe.  <br>
<br>
In all end, I think DAoC will go a long way.<br>

How high did you get your character(s)?  This is not a rhetorical question, I'd like to know so I can get a feel for where you're getting this information.  It seems wierd to me that someone who's played the game would call the combat system crappy, but to each his own. <p>Ahry - hero of Gaoth an Iar, Percival server <BR>

<br>
Some things in a game call for an upgrade of classes and some thing call for a nerf, usually it’s a well defined line of demarcation between the two.<br>
<br>
In beta, Archers were God up until a point(and I believe I posted about this here before). They get a critical shot ability that gives them a multiplier of damage and they also get the hide skill that renders them almost completely invisible, totally invisible at a distance. So archers would roam the battlefield, or stand in one place, completely unseen and just snipe people. It doesn’t sound all that bad, pretty neat actually, but the broken aspect was that hiding was instantaneous. Meaning, Archer would snipe someone and appear for a split second before going inviso again. Even if you managed to target him in that brief instant, you lost the target when he went into sneak mode again. Insta-hide was very, very broken and no amount of buffing to other classes would have brought it in line.<br>
<br>
An email went from me to Sanya to Marc Jacobs and sneak gained a 10-second reuse time in the next patch. They’re still hella-powerful, they just have to put more thought into where they shoot from instead of standing in an open field while mowing people down. <p><b>Vendrix</b><br>

Here is my personal opinion and plan.... for the moment.<br>
<br>
My eq character(main) and guild are approaching a fun time.  My main character is 57 and still has not seen/done many things, I want to see/do them.  My guild has a whle crop right around 50 so then we'll be able to see/do more (not quite like some of the names on this thread tho).  I plan on see the game thru to filling the bar in 60 as well as more adventures with guildies but will play DAoC for the time being as a diversion to the diversion, aka second fiddle to EQ<br>
<br>
I have played DAoC since beta 4 and have a slew of characters scattered around and really don't think much of the game other than it is EQ 1.5 or EQ for those with A.D.D., better graphics, less down time and not much beyond that. Same basic systems and a lot of hybrid classes, an enchanter type character with sow and perma charm or heals/res' is a wonderfull thing.  <br>
<br>
What would EQ look/be like if they recreated it today?  Computing power has grown from 200mhz to 2ghz, graphics power has soared from the mighty VooDoo2 to the GForce3, broadband, bus speeds, DDR, AGP 4x, etc.  I shudder to think where we'll be in two more years and what DAoC will look like in the rear view mirror.<br>
<br>
Kudos to Mythic for making a nice stable game, good graphics, but I think most of their developers where EQ players with A.D.D. and capability envy.  <br>

DOAC will be just like the ohters I have played like Asheron's call andwill be cool for a couple months.<br>
<br>
Will I play DOAC.  Probably but I wont flame EQ.  Most of the people who played EQ and are flamin it now have played it for years.  MY GOD YEARS.  Name a game that can hook you for that long.<br>
<br>
Face it you have to give EQ its props it was the revolutionary game and DOAC is nothing but an Evolutionary game.  EQ will outlive DOAC and will surpass it withnew releases.  EQ is the Microsoft of its genre.  People are starting to hate it because its to good and are making a overrated competitor seem great in the hopes of bringing EQ down.  I laugh at this.<br>
<br>
What I am trying to say is I am gonna be ROLFLMFAO when DOAC becomes another AC and people start coming back to EQ.  Especially the ones that have flamed the heck out of EQ.<br>
