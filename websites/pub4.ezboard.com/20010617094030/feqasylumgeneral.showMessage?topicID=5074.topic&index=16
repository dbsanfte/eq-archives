I went back and re-read your post 4 times to see if I was missing something. I have to say that your observations were certainly well thought out and articulate. I too believe that indifference may very well be one of the major factors which could destroy our society. I believe that indifference towards those who have bled and died to make our nation what it is, is a disturbing trend in our society. I believe that indifference towards the principles upon which our nation was founded, could certainly wreak havoc on our society. I believe that people who would stand up for freedom of speech, as guaranteed by our Constitution, would seek to keep kids who WANT to pray from doing so in school, could have an adverse effect on our nation. I can't really say whether or not any war actually accomplished what it was set out to, but I can say that to all those who fought, died, and especially those who came home to an INDIFFERENT nation, you are heroes without equal. <br>
   I was in the US Army at the time of the Gulf War.I was just about ready to graduate from AIT when Iraq invaded Kuwait. I won't sit here and pretend that I was thrilled at the prospect of running right over and giving my life, but I can say that I was willing, for that is the job I signed up to do. <br>
   War is the most repugnant thing on the face of the earth. If you study history, you will see that it isn't the warriors who are eager to shed blood, they are mere organs of the state. If in their wisdom the leadership of any nation deems war necessary, warriors have nothing to do but follow orders. Honor, duty, courage, and a love of their nation few who haven't served could possibly know demand nothing less. So I think you might be right, indifference may very well be the root of all evil, but not necessarily the way you think. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uhsianlichen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Hsian Li Chen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><FONT COLOR=AA0000><B>Lanys.com Moderator</B></FONT></span><br> <font color=#000033>(5/28/01 11:06:18 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Memorial Day-More then Just a Mattress Sale</span><hr size=1> ok its a holiday and a time to remember your vets all you 'mercans... so play nice.<br>

The military itself isn't the problem, it is simple a RESULT of the problem.  When I see those men and women in uniform, I see a machine (yes it IS a machine) that exists because there are so many bad things in this world.  Us &quot;high brow intellectuals&quot; see the world for what it is (well some of us) and realize that the price of peace is vigilance, not threat and force.  Our military has turned into little but threat and force, whether this is a reflection of it's members, or of the beaurocracy, I can't say because my direct experience is minimal, but I can't mentally segregate the bad from the good.  When I look at something, I HAVE to see the bad and the good, I have to contemplate both simultaneously.  Doing anything else is dishonest.<br>
<br>
Oh, those in uniform fought for my freedom right? Doesn't that freedom include free speech? Why the flames?  I make no disparaging remarks against the personalities and characters of those in uniform, only the organization itself.<br>
<br>
I think microsoft is a company that should be dismantled and reformed better, I think it is doing harm to the entire industry. I think it cheats and steals to get ahead.  But, my best friend is a microsoft technician.  And a good deal of my friends are going to work for them.  They aren't bad people, just as the people AT microsoft aren't all that bad, but the community that makes microsoft is generally dishonest.<br>
<br>
Same goes with the armed services.  My mouth goes dry whenever I hear anything to do with the military, I am VERY afraid that we are going to cause WWIII.  In the beginning of this century, the U.S. practiced isolationism, the great white fleet was the first step to showing the world that we were now opening ourselves to others.  It was a mark of our strength. In WWI we saved the day, in WWII we saved the day. I can't speak much about Korean war, because I came to this country a bit after the time when I would have learned about it (note to self: research) in Vietnam we did HIGHLY IMMORAL and DISGUSTING things, desert storm was a joke, and a few years ago we bombed Kosovo.  Do you see the trend? From the strength of the 20's-50's, to this pale beaurocracy.<br>
<br>
Never disassociate, please.  All good and no bad is a lie, and lying is BAD. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uglasse.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Glasse</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>w4nn4b3!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(5/29/01 8:12:14 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.cyberarmor.net/images/sigs/stuart.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Missing something.</span><hr size=1> I can see what you are saying, Euriped, however I believe you may be approaching from an odd angle.<br>
<br>
Whether you or I or anyone else agrees with the military or the way it is used there are a few indisputable facts about human life on this little planet.  These facts are:<br>
<br>
- Man is violent.  He has been since before recorded history.  Recently a site has been discovered in South America that has the earliest human remains ever found in this hemisphere, predating the Mayans by over 400 years.  Guess how they died?  They were clubbed to death while tied to posts.<br>
<br>
- Peace is fleeting.  It simply cannot last.  During quiet times the next despot is being raised.  Quiet times give people time to think, and the next issues that cause war are born (such as a new religious regime, cults, seperatists, politics become even more skewed - sometimes it's simple stagnation).<br>
<br>
- There are irreconcilable differences between many religious and ethnic groups, from their core beliefs outward.<br>
<br>
- Although each presidency has its own way of handling foreign policy diplomacy is always tried first.  When diplomacy fails the military is used as the &quot;arm of action&quot; by the executive areas of our government.<br>
<br>
- The Gulf War might have been a joke compared to drawn-out, high-casualty conflict but ask a repatriated Kuwaiti how they feel about it.  While you're making international long-distance calls talk to the people aided by the U.S. Military in Somalia and Bosnia-Herzegovina.  Next call a few people in Sierra Leone, Haiti, Rwanda or any of the other places in this world that asked for and did not receive the same help we gave to the others.  Ask them what became of their lives, their families, their countries.  Before you put your calling card away phone the U.N. and see if you can get a straight answer as to why they would not allow the allies to overthrow Suddam Hussein, and ask them what they think of him continuing to spend money on military equipment and weapons instead of letting the limited funds go to feed his people and keep them healthy.<br>
<br>
- I'll grant that many atrocities were commited in Vietnam, and I cannot justify it but I will say this: these things occurred out of pure frustration because the U.S. Military was up against an entirely different kind of enemy than it had ever seen before.  Guerilla warfare was new to us.  Underground and night fighting was new to us.  Unclear lines of friend/foe were new to us (don't know if you ever get used to that one).  Long-distance leadership was new to us.  You also cannot overlook the fact that many of the atrocious things done were learned from the Vietnamese - an eye for an eye kind of thing.  If you do your history as you plan to you will need to research all the way back into the late 1940's when we first sent &quot;Advisors&quot; to Vietnam.  The French were still licking their wounds but we ignored what they had learned there.  The Advisors told the Joint Chiefs and anyone else who would listen for the next 20 years that we were not prepared to fight a war in Vietnam and that if we did casualties would be heavy and the conflict would be long.  Our government does not always make the best decisions.  Seems we're not the only ones - after you finish learning about Vietnam study the Russian/Afghan war or the British/Balkan conflict. If you can't find at least a dozen similarities to our time in Vietnam read about them again.<br>
<br>
------<br>
What I am trying to get across is that the Military is not evil.  It is a necessary tool, even if used only as a deterrent.  How that tool is used is determined by the current Administration in the Whitehouse, with Congress throwing their 2 cents in.<br>
<br>
The military is not always used for the right purpose or at the right time.  Sometimes they are sent where they should not be, others they are held back from where they should go.<br>
<br>
However, you cannot hold them accountable for that.  Shake your fist at our Government, vote, write your representatives in Congress... anything you can to sway the Government to behave properly.  But never, please never disrespect the sacrifices made by the members of the United States Military.  Those people do the best job they can, more often than not in adverse circumstances, sometimes not agreeing with their assignment - because they believe in the government of our country.  Like a marriage, through thick and thin they support the government and its wishes.<br>
<br>
They deserve our support in return. <p><IMG SRC=http://www.cyberarmor.net/images/sigs/glassesig.jpg></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uglasse.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Glasse</A> at: 5/29/01 8:17:27 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uwinsomecannon.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Winsome Cannon</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t d00d!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(5/29/01 8:32:49 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Missing something.</span><hr size=1>  Euriped sounds to me like the person that complains about the military and then is the first to run and hide behind a soldiers legs if something goes dreadfully wrong in our great country.<br>

I used to sit and listen to the stories that they told while drunk (they wouldnt talk about them sober). About the shrapnel, the tracers, the prayers, the lost pals. All of it was pretty scary to hear as a child. Soon I grew up, and they seemed to talk about it less and less. Then one day, when my father finally decided to share some of his past with me (the ole father son emotional breakthrou). He related a story to me. A year in 'the bush', same two sets of uniforms, 50lbs lighter, they finally handed him his papers and said &quot;Good job son, go home, your country's waiting for you.&quot; He boarded a plane, and after what seemed like a lifetime landed back in the states. There was a small 'welcoming' committee waiting at the airport, along with my mother. He was spit on, screamed at, etc; but he didnt mind, because there was my mom holding me, born while he was gone. <br>
Memorial day, in my opinion isnt a day to dwell on the politics; its to /salute the homecomers, and remember the ones that didnt make it.<br>
