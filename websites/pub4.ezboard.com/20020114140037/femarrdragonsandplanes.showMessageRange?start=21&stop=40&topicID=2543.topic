<br>
Early on in my marriage (of 12 years), I was the beggar...stress about money played a huge role. Also, we had two little munchkins running around the house...and I was working full-time and going to school full time. I'd come home every night at 11PM and have to get up at 4AM to go to work.<br>
<br>
It also could be that he is becoming impotent...<br>
<br>
Also, it could be he feels pressure from you. Some men feel so pressured (atop of the pressure they already feel in the day-to-day), that they just can't 'get it on'. <br>
<br>
Try doing something that makes him feel appreciated. That always changes the mood.<br>

Maybe, and I may be going out on a limb here, but maybe he is looking for more than just a carnal relationship here. Switch roles in this relationship, when you're the perverted horney male and he's the heart-filled romantic type.<br>
Do you two do anything other than have sex? Like going out? Movies? Plays? Theatres? Parks? Trips? Any other hobbies than fornicating?<br>
<br>
I don't know why he'd turn down the chance of dipping his hands in your honeypot, maybe he's gay.<br>
<br>
I'm not trying to bash you or make light of this situation, but if you are really into him then sit him down and TALK about it. This is way more effective than coming here and listening to a bunch of computer gamers and internet geeks give you tips and advice about sex. (like me!)<br>
<br>
Talk to him. That's my advice. If it doesn't work out, give me a call. I'll take good care of you. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

This post sounds to0 discriptive to be coming from a female... perhaps its just me.<br>
<br>
If this is a female who posted this then you WANT TOO MUCH!   Gawd! 4 times a day???? After a long dry spell i can see this but the third day or so it gonna start to get boring no matter what you do (or how).<br>

This is a joke, right?<br>
<br>
I think this thread is just meant to get a bunch of people to try and imagine their dream woman, who is unsatisfied in her current relationship, has a "perfect" body, and has an insatiable appetite for sex.<br>
<br>
This person obviously knows that there is a large population of men that frequent this board, and is trying to get a rise out of them.  The post has absolutley nothing to do with EQ, and the poster has only this one post.<br>
<br>
Actually, the comments being received were probably not even the what the author of the post had envisioned receiving.  They probably were hoping more for "Holy shit, I wish *I* had that problem", or "What's your phone number, I'll satisfy you".<br>

It's titled &quot;How to Make Love Six Nights a Week&quot;, by Graham Ben Masterton.  You can find it on www.bn.com with a search by title--it's about $7.<br>
<br>
The author addresses the fact that some people do have much stronger sex drives than their partners (this is NOT some sign of abnormality, by far) or simply get &quot;in the mood&quot; at different times . . . such as, say, a woman who's horny at 7 PM after dinner, with a husband who heats up at 2 AM.  There's a lot of good sound advice in there.<br>
<br>
The best advice I can offer, besides encouraging you to check out that book, is to sit down with your fiance for a very frank discussion about your sex life.  The first thing you should do is agree that you will be honest with each other during the conversation, and that you will not react with disgust or anger to anything said, but try to understand each other's comments and feelings.  Don't be confrontational . . . saying &quot;I need more sex and you're just not giving it to me&quot; is not going to help.  The person who suggested getting a couple sex toys to please yourself had a good idea there, too--I'd also recommend that you let your fiance use them on you, if he would like (this can lead to other things too!).  Show him that the toys aren't sexual rivals for him . . . they're his &quot;relief pitchers&quot;.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Don't put pressure on him to perform, because it's more likely to make him reject the idea.  Pole-in-hole isn't the only type of activity, after all . . . if he's willing to give you oral sex, heavy petting, play with the aforementioned toys, etc, that's a good way to ease him into the idea of more frequent activity.<br>
<br>
Good luck.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   (Incidentally, the final split with my fiance had nothing to do with sex . . . had to do with the fact that at 30 years old, he had all the maturity and common sense of a ten-year-old, and I was tired of that behavior.  I'm currently involved with a guy who's much, much more my type--over six feet tall with longish dark hair and big nimble hands.  Yum!)<br>

I read this shortly after it was posted.  My first thoughts were that this wasn't a female.  It could be, I suppose, but why the hell you'd bring this sort of issue to a game board, populated by primarily men, some of whom aren't even adults, is beyond me.<br>
<br>
It's inappropriate, and it doesn't belong here.  IF, on the wild chance I ever had a similar problem, which is unlikely, I have plenty of folks I could talk to, both men AND women, who'd be happy to listen and give me advice.<br>

The use of the word &quot;fiancee.&quot;  Now it could just be a typo, but the double &quot;e&quot; means female.  If a guy was typing something up about a fiance, he might just inadvertently show a gender bias.<br>

It's not meant to sound like i'm some &quot;dream girl&quot;.  do i need to list all my faults too?<br>
<br>
and YES i made this acct.  JUST for this post lol  i'm not going to use my regular acct.!  <br>
<br>
I HAVE spoken w/ him about this... his only response it &quot;he's not in the mood&quot;  and there doesn't seem to be anything that i CAN do to get him in such =/<br>
<br>
Thank you for the advice... some of it i will Definitely take into consideration.<br>
<br>

Advice and just a way to vent is what i wanted here...  sorry but since i moved EQ has been my saving grace and this is one board i frequent often.  the other is my guild MB  and i definitly wasn't going to post this there... i wanted it to be anon. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ulostwillysadnow.showPublicProfile?language=EN>lostwillysadnow</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#E9D756>(10/17/01 11:34:00 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: men who don't like sex</span><hr size=1> oh and ... as for using the word Pussy... i feel rediculus (sp?) calling it anything else... i'm sorry .. but that's what it is... a pussy.... <br>

I’m gtg at LEAST 2 times a day, and ive been with my wife 9 years.  <br>
<br>
Stress might be it, but there’s nothing a good bj couldn’t fix.<br>
<br>
Maybe he’s cheating on you, but if he’s doing that he’d sleep with the both of ya, I know I would.<br>
<br>
Impotent, guys that have these kinds of problems tend to fix it themselves, go to the doctor, and invest in other types of medication.<br>
<br>
"Not in the mood” Like I say, I don’t know how this can exist, BUT there is nothing a good 4-hr porn couldent fix! (If the bj doesn’t work)<br>
<br>
Or last but not least... He’s gay.<br>
<br>
Hope that helps!<br>
