<br>
Notice how some laws are more important than others, such as changing lanes in an intersection versus providing opposition countries with state secrets.  <br>
<br>
Now again, look back at this: I will not fight because I find no point in going in and leveling some country full of people already suffering and who in all likelihood (even if they are Taliban) did not help carry out the attack.  Fine, go in, kill Osama Bin Laden, track down all his associates, kill them as well, jail the people that willingly supported him.  <br>
<br>
The fact that I've made this decision though makes me a criminal in the minds of many, and a coward in the minds as probably more.  It's quite ironic to me that in this time of utter emotional reactions I would be criminalized for having an opposing view and for willing to carry that view to its logical conclusion.  <br>
<br>
We are free until we are told otherwise, and everyone here is telling me otherwise.  Should I have left the country?  Hell no.  I'm just as American as any other guy, I just don't feel like being an American is synonymous with wanting to level 3rd world countries or fighting to police the world against some nebulous &quot;evil&quot; organization.  <br>
<br>
The fact that I'm not American in your way, in the way that you consider &quot;legal&quot; and that the statutes consider &quot;legal&quot; is an entirely relative situation.  We are identified not by the rules we break, but by the values we uphold, and I garauntee I stand by the same values of every American, I just cannot uphold them the way it seems the masses of vengeance wish to. <br>

<br>
I agree, it's an absurdity that 18-year olds possess all the rights of a citizen except the right to get smashed like the rest of us. So lower the drinking age. Unfortunately, since we are discussing the draft, rather than legalized drinking, this is hardly relevant.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Any 18-year-old who is still letting others make their life for them is pretty pathetic.&quot;<br>
<br>
Exactly. They are adults, and should be treated accordingly. You go back and forth on that, you know.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Legally, they are adults, yes.  They can vote and buy cigarettes and so forth.  Biologically and physically, though, they are still adolesents.&quot;<br>
<br>
Only if they have some sort of glandular condition. Most human beings at that age are done growing for the most part, physically. You're wrong, consult a text.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Even a very mature 18 year old is often at the mercy of their hormones, making them very confused. Coddled or not, a mind is not fully formed until much older.&quot;<br>
<br>
I'm in my late 20s, and I can assure you, I'm still at the mercy of my hormones, leading to untold confusion. Hopefully, I'll remain at the mercy of my hormones until the day I die. Hormones aren't an issue with maturity...upbringing and child-rearing are. No 'mind' worthy of the name is ever fully formed, anyway. <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;I know people who were out on their own at 18 and younger, but most people are simply not ready, brainwise.&quot;<br>
<br>
Most people are never ready, brainwise, period. I'm afraid spiritual and intellectual maturity isn't a required trait in a successful combat soldier, and I'm not sure why you should think so. Perhaps we could empty out the nursing homes...<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;4 months and $2000 American later, I move to Canada.  I still have to wait to get my green card so I can get work.  Where do I live in the meantime?&quot;<br>
<br>
Wah. This is what I'm talking about. Why Canada? Canada is a first world nation with many of the same laws and customs that we have. Quite the luxurious place of exile, yes? No one really wants a draft dodger, Zariel.<br>
<br>
Nigeria. Forty dollars American tucked into your passport gets you onto the street free and clear, I know this for certain. There are plenty of 3rd world toilets that won't care if you have a visa or not. A surprising number of those toilets are in this hemisphere, and yes, you can walk to them.<br>
<br>
<br>
Physically, an 18-year old is very much an adult. I think the issue that distresses you is that the average American 18-year old behaves like a pre-schooler.<br>
<br>
This has nothing to do with biology, and everything to do with society. We treat them as children, and they stay children, far past the point at which they should become responsible people. Parents indulge their children to the point of excess, and the result is that many of the children refuse to grow up before the age of 35.<br>
<br>
While our people are physically mature at the age of 18, they are behaviorally retarded. Retarded, as in the technical definition.<br>
<br>
Parents have the right to do this, but that doesn't mean it's a good idea. As a matter of fact, I think it's a spectacularly bad idea. We give them eighteen years to grow up, longer if they get lucky. Luck has been running short for the last century, so I'm afraid they'll just have to muddle through if called upon to perform their civic duties prior to their 40th birthdays. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ubelgarbattlebiztch.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Belgar Battlebiztch</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 67<br> <font color=#E9D756>(9/27/01 3:57:05 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.lof.ukhq.co.uk/classmembers/belgar.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: *insert title here*</span><hr size=1> Basically the draft as was is un constitutional, that I will not argue.  Also, it seems that Everyone considers the war is thinking of the Vietnam war.  Oh, Police action.  They won't call it a war, because we lost and it will mess with our status quo.  But face it, we in America know exactly what it was, and that we lost one.<br>
<br>
Fast Forward to the present please.  Gulf War...that was a war.  We won, with few fatalities.  Because we have better strategic minds, we weren't the only team involved, we had superior equipment, and last but never least, our men and women over there fighting for what they believe is right and just.  We did our research on that one folks, but people seem to forget that, and let Vietnam loom over thier heads.  Vietnam was a lesson learned painfully, but we learned it well.  So in fact did the politicians.  They could never endure another term putting thier constituants through another battle like that one.<br>
<br>
So you crying that, <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  I will not fight because I find no point in going in and leveling some country full of people already suffering and who in all likelihood (even if they are Taliban) did not help carry out the attack. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> I find to still be selfish, self serving, and yes cowardly.  You won't go in and fight, but you'll enjoy the freedom derived from those that will.  And save the because, I deplore justification of excuses, such as the ones that you and Triff try to spew to cover up your choices in cowardice.<br>
<br>
And Taliban is a religious group, not an ethenicity &lt;sp&gt;.<br>
<br>
I understand it's a confusing time, and a terrifying time.  That's why the action of war is a last ditch scenario.  As well as the draft.  All you did was let the government know what percentage of &quot;Eligible&quot; fighting force they have IF it is needed to protect the ideals and the people of the United States of America.  The mothers, grandparents, and children that cannot protect themselves.  More than likely this &quot;War&quot; will be fought with minimal ground forces, extreme espionage type warfare will most likely be brought to bare.  And those &quot;Innocents&quot; are running for Pakistan, and other safer areas.  The likelyhood of them coming up, and being construed as an armed threat, against our troops is phenominal.<br>
<br>
As for running to Canada....sorry, bet they'll be there right beside us.  You choose not to fight, I challenge your decision, and will fight your decision, as being totally arrogant that your skin somehow is more sacred than anyone elses.  What of the 18 year old child that enlists rather than getting drafted?  Does he/she know what they're doing?  Bah, getting drowned in what if scenarios, and excuses...black and white here.  You'll let others fight for you, and derive the benefits from it.  That's a leech/parasite to me.  <br>
<br>
If called on, you go...pray to god what you're doing is right, call them on it when you see it's not.  Fight from the inside against the wrongdoings going on.  But don't sit and cry that you won't fight an (as yet) undetermind foe, because.  We all know the because is you're scared...so are we!  But more angry than scared.  Yes, I don't want to hurt those that are just trying to get through life over there...imagine what they'd give for what you profess not to be worth fighting for. <p><Center><IMG SRC="http://www.lof.ukhq.co.uk/sigs/belgar.jpg"><BR><IT>

I agree with your entire first two paragraphs.  What I don't understand is what the Gulf War has to do with anything here.  <br>
<br>
The gulf war was yes, a real war, with a very identifiable foe and a conventional means of defeating them.  We won because our conventional mechanisms of war kicked the shit out of their conventional mechanisms of war.  We've been able to do this for a few decades to just about any country in the world.  <br>
<br>
Yes, we learned from Vietnam in that respect, but fighting in the desert is a bit different than in the jungle.  Fighting in mountainous terrain that you aren't familiar with is different than rolling a nice big ol tank across the desert.<br>
<br>
This leads me to your hand-waving argument against me: Since I stand up and defend my opinion and my choice by attempting to explain it to you I am somehow doubly selfish and self-serving?  <br>
<br>
I don't HAVE to sit here and try to explain to you why I feel the way I do but obviously you feel that you have to explain to me how unAmerican, evil and selfish I am.  God forbid I come back with an intelligent argument against massive military action, that'd just prove my cowardice even more. <br>
<br>
I know the Taliban is a religious group, and I also realize that there are a lot of internal groups (many ethnicly oriented) against them.  <br>
<br>
History lesson:  Afghanistan has not and still does not have national identity because it was part of colonialism between Russia and England.  It was a buffer state created betwen the area south of Russia and British India with nominal control being in British hands.  The division created was, as in all colonial divisions, not perfect and left a lot of ethnic groups in two countries.  Thus, the extreme support of a lot of northern Pakistan for the Afghan government and Osama Bin Laden. <br>
<br>
This however leads to the funny little thing that just now is coming to the media:  The Taliban are NOT as stable as anyone would like to think.  We don't have to do a damn thing to have them collapse from starvation if anything.  <br>
<br>
This is why I'm pissed we're calling up thousands upon thousands of reservists with the talk of a multi-national multi-year &quot;crusade&quot; against the &quot;evildoers&quot;. Why? Because it's fucking propaganda that doesn't help anything but gives any Allah-loving Muslim in the middle east that much more reason to hate our asses.<br>
<br>
If you want to talk about likelihoods, how about this:  Only one world trade center tower was insured because it was thought that the chances of both being destroyed was too low to matter. <br>
<br>
Oh, right, I forgot, my entire basis as an American male rests on my willingness to heed the call of the shepard's horn when he decides it's time for him to make a good showing, to build confidence by letting CNN tape me walking through the mountains of Afghanistan cause then we'll have this all under control...<br>
<br>
Gimme a break, save your rhetoric for someone who can't see a patheticly orchestrated guilt trip when they see one...<br>

The problem here is that you feel you should be truly and entirely free, and not be forced into doing anything you don't feel like doing. Like fighting in this possible war we're discussing.<br>
<br>
A state where all are entirely free to do as they wish is anarchy.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately for you, this is not an anarchist state. We are living in a democratic republic. <br>
<br>
One of the amusing things about living in such a place is that, when a law is passed that YOU happen to agree with, the People have spoken, and justice is done. When a law is passed or enacted that you DON'T agree with, the people become the &quot;herd&quot;. And suddenly, you feel as though you, you specifically, should have the right to disobey the law. Essentially, you only want to play the game as long as you have a winning hand.<br>
<br>
Disagreeing with the strategic assessment of our duly elected leadership is NOT grounds for being excused from the draft. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
You know what we call people who pout and refuse to play when they don't get their way?<br>
<br>
We call them spoiled brats. And that's exactly what you're doing.<br>

My apologies, I'll attempt not to offend your sense of patriotism next time and I'll lash myself fifty times for even thinking of not fighting when called to.  <br>

<br>
You'd love to think it's to myself, but you'd call me Triff if I said you're thinking only of yourself as well. There's great irony in this I think.<br>

Call me whatever you want, the more I try to defend myself the more that somehow proves how much of a coward I am.  Ever think that if I was a coward I wouldn't even bother to discuss it with you?  I'm trying to make a point about our whole view of this situation and hopefully by shocking you all you'll maybe, just maybe, see why Americans are so often a bunch of fucking morons when it comes to the international world.

Saying &quot;but that's against the law&quot; will win a legal argument, but doesn't really have any bearing on a moral argument.<br>
<br>
And I believe the real issue at stake is whether I'm morally bound to lay down my life on the word of a government (which I didn't vote for) because I owe it to the people who did so many decades ago for some other government. One could then argue as to whether those lives actually had a bearing on the freedom or otherwise of my life and society. This is of course dependant on which country I live in. Tonga went to war in WW1 and 2, but did their contribution have a marked effect on the outcome of the war? Perhaps I would owe it to the other allied servicemen who died to go to war on behalf of the King of Tonga? What about German, Japanese, or alternately Swiss citizens? I've also seen debate as to whether the (late) entry of the US into the two world wars was really a decisive factor, and even so, if the wars would have had much bearing on the US given some other possible actions or outcomes. (Don't raise a flame war on this last issue. To be honest, I don't know or care).<br>

Zariel, did you know that if you move over here (Australia) women are (legally) just as likely to be called as men?

That would mean that, for example, World War II was wrong.  So, what you would be saying is that even if the moral cause is correct, we (as a nation) should not go to war. Problem with that is, by not going to war, we are allowing horrible attrocities to be commited.  (The political leaders knew this, if the common citizens didn't)<br>
<br>
You could say, well, we should go to war only if the moral ground for fighting is greater than the sanctity of human life.  In other words, our action should be that which is for the greatest good of humanity as a whole.<br>
<br>
I argue then, that this war with Afganistan is for the greatest good for humanity as a whole.  By apprehending the terrorists responsible, we are providing justice; by declaring war on the governments who harbour these terrorists, we say that we will not tolerate needless destruction of lives, regardless of citizenship. (remember the victims are from many different countries, not just our own)  We are upholding our own idea of right.  Our right, our ideal, that all people are entitled to a life without fear of becoming part of someone else's &quot;political statement&quot;<br>
<br>
You would argue, or so it would seem from yer posts, that we shouldn't reciprocate by killing innocent Afganistanis.  I agree, in principle.  But, I am also a realist.  I know that some innocents may die.  It is the job of our military to make sure innocent people don't get hurt.  The target of any military operations that I am willing to support should only be the Taliban government, and its army, or course.  (and getting the terrorists too, but I am thinking more in a long term, sustained sort of engagement)<br>
<br>
Basically, what I am saying is, our military actions against the Taliban are a defense of freedom.  If America does not respond with military action against this governmental organization, then we are surrendering part of that freedom.  You are saying that you want to be free, but you don't want to pay for that freedom.  It is the job of free men and women to defend their freedom, when need be.  You can thank those that did believe in the defense of freedom for your right to openly state your opinions and beliefs.  Of course, the best way to do that is to honor their memory and example; to do your duty.<br>
<br>
I know that there is nothing I, or anyone short of God, can say to change your mind.  But I want you to know that I think you are a coward.  You are a coward because you refuse to do your duty. I hold my freedom as a sacred right, and will defend it if needed.  <br>

And this the other. To my mind it depends on the manner in which it is carried out. And I personally distrust the US military when it comes to dealing sensitively with highly volatile situations. I'd love to see Osama bin Laden and the Taliban both out of action. But not only do I want minimal loss of innocent Afghani lives, but I don't want to see Osama die as a matyr to a cause and stir up even more hatred of the US, Christianity, Judaism, the West or what have you, propogating a further downward spiral of violence. I found lots of interesting editorials and the like at <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://againstrevenge.org/links.html">AgainstRevenge.org</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->.

In 1914, a terrorist murdered the heir to the throne of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, then fled to nearby Serbia. When tiny Serbia refused to extradite him, mighty Austria felt itself compelled by great-power politics (not to mention by the emperor's anger) to invade Serbia. The result was World War I, the largest war in history to that time. Among that war's fruits were the defeat and dismemberment of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and the abolition of the 600-year-old House of Hapsburg.<br>

<br>
The estimated damages from the assault include over 5,000 dead, and $20 billion in property damage. To put that in perspective, since the day Bush took office, (but still prior to the attack), over 200,000 Americans lost their lives to diseases related to smoking, and more than 100 times the value of the property damage from the attack evaporated from declines in the stock market.<br>
<br>
The US went to Vietnam to stop the Communist dominos from falling, and the entire region fell to the Communists. The US invaded Panama, supposedly to end drug-dealing there, and today Panama is more overrun with the drug trade than ever. After years of arming Saddam Hussein, the US invaded Iraq to get rid of him, but he is still held up as a terrible threat to the world. The US bombed Libya to teach terrorists a lesson; so the terrorists hijacked the Pan American plane over Scotland.<br>

Freedom is NOT free. There is a price. The price our society has named is the draft. Time to pay up should it be put into effect.

Honestly, I am not enamoured of the idea of being shot at (I have been and it was truly unpleasant) but, I would answer that call if it came and gladly do so out of DUTY and love for my country.

Arikel just made an excellent post regarding civil rights activists. Civil rights activists stood up. They risked prison terms and in a few cases, their lives, for their beliefs.<br>

When you risk the same, you'll be 'standing up'. Until then, be sure to send us a postcard from Canada. <br>

I do have to say that you seem to be taking some of what I'm saying personally; I do not mean to get personal, sorry if I seemed that way.  Yes, some of my thoughts are directed at things you said, but they don't reflect an opinion of _you_, only of your comments.<br>
<br>
[quote]Exactly. They are adults, and should be treated accordingly. You go back and forth on that, you know.[/quote]<br>
<br>
How so?  You said that 18-year-olds had their lives made for them.  I disagreed.  Do I think they are adults?  No.  They are teens, biologically adolescent.  Do I think they have minds of their own and should be establishing their own lives?  Yes.<br>
<br>
[quote]Only if they have some sort of glandular condition. Most human beings at that age [18] are done growing for the most part, physically. You're wrong, consult a text.[/quote]<br>
<br>
Actually, biological adolescence ends around age 24.  I learned this in high school and read a study on it in college.  The biorythms observed in people in their teenage years are the same as people in their early 20s.  You cannot tell the difference in most cases.  Obviously, it stops earlier for some and later for others, but most 24-year-olds' biorythms are indistinguishable from most 15-year-olds'.  <br>
Anyway, what does physical growth mean?  My sister is 5' tall, my brother is 6'4", but I wouldn't say he's more mature than she is!  As for being done growing, don't count on it.  When I went to college at 18, I was 5'3".  I've now in my 20's, and closing on 5'5".  *shrug*<br>
<br>
[quote]I'm in my late 20s, and I can assure you, I'm still at the mercy of my hormones,[/quote]<br>
<br>
Wow, that must be terrible.  I am younger than you, and have a great deal of control over my hormones.  Although I still get ordinary hormonal urges, I have learned to ignore them; I am not an animal.  Hormones are stronger in one's adolescence; they cloud one's thinking.<br>
<br>
[quote]Hormones aren't an issue with maturity...upbringing and child-rearing are.[/quote]<br>
<br>
That's true, but how can someone who is at the mercy of their hormones be considered mature?  Part of maturity is controlling yourself.<br>
<br>
[quote]I'm afraid spiritual and intellectual maturity isn't a required trait in a successful combat soldier, and I'm not sure why you should think so.[/quote]<br>
<br>
Please, Kytherion -- do NOT put words in my mouth.  I said no such thing, and I'm not even sure I implied it.  I certainly don't think they are necessary traits in a combat soldier.  In point of fact, I think a spiritually mature person really wouldn't want to go into combat, and would find other ways to help the war effort.  As for intellectually mature...well, I'd rather have someone with that trait beside me on the battlefield, but I suppose it's not necessary.<br>
<br>
[quote]Wah. This is what I'm talking about. Why Canada?[/quote]<br>
<br>
Because I know something about its laws, and I've never been there.<br>
<br>
[quote]No one really wants a draft dodger, Zariel.[/quote]<br>
<br>
I'm not condoning draft dodging; I just think that people have the right to live here and not join the armed forces!  You seem to think that I am a draft dodger, or supporting that, or something.  Let me make it clear to you: I will _never_ be drafted.  One, I am an asthmatic.  Two, I have severe, chronic, clinical Depression that I control with medication.  And three, I AM FEMALE!  I don't have to worry about the draft.  This country doesn't draft women.  Personally, I think women should have to register for the draft, since men have to.  If women want equal rights (and I do), then we have to take the good with the bad.  Now, I don't think anyone should _have_ to register, but that's another matter.<br>
<br>
[/quote]There are plenty of 3rd world toilets that won't care if you have a visa or not. A surprising number of those toilets are in this hemisphere, and yes, you can walk to them.[quote]<br>
<br>
Well, I know _I_ can't walk to Nigeria.  However, I see what you are saying.  Once again, though, I think it is unjust to expect someone to live in a horrible place, simply because they do not want to support a war.  So what if someone doesn't support a war?  It's a matter of opinion!  People are free to disagree, without living in a toilet.<br>
<br>
[quote]Parents indulge their children to the point of excess, and the result is that many of the children refuse to grow up before the age of 35.[/quote]<br>
<br>
Speaking as someone who was "indulged," being indulged does not keep one from growing up.  I had very stern, loving, protective parents, who wanted to shield me from harm -- commendable, no?  That didn't prevent me from growing up.  Now, I have been living on my own since age 21.  I have a long-term, stable relationship with the man I am going to marry.  I have a developing career.  And I have many friends and various interests to occupy my free time.  I think I'm distressingly grown up!  I don't think indulgence has to do with the refusal to grow up, I think that has to do with the individual.<br>
I'd just like to quickly clarify my views.  I support military action.  I do not think people who do not support it should be forced to participate in it.  I oppose the law that requires young men to register for the draft.  I do not support draft-dodging, as it is unlawful; the law is the law, whether I like it or not.  I will never be drafted, but I oppose the draft's existence anyway.  I would make a terrible soldier, in combat or out of it; I don't deal well with authority.<br>
