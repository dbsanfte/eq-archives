I had a twink (now my main) that was a monk, same class as Ted. Ted would log on, say hello group with me was realy cool. Used to send me tells, asking me to trade him my silbisian beserker cloak, would tell me how my twink was better geared then his main and give me a sob story. After weeks of this, I finaly went to him on a guild raid and gave it to him, he cancled the trade window. Asked me what it was for, told him it was for him. He cancled the trade window again, I told him to take it untill he got better, that he realy wanted it and I know he would use it. I stoped hearing from him soon after, a good part because the guild broke up. I would say hello to him from time to time when I saw him on, most of the time I got no response from him. I quit playing EQ for a month, partly because I was severly hampered as a melee class with no haste item now, and repeated tries at camping a replacememt turned up nill. I would ask him from time to time if he had gotten a better cloak yet, as I realy needed that one back. One day he replied with &quot;I'm holding out for one cloak&quot; That being a cloak of the falling stars. Him holding out for a particular cloak did not make me to happy I will say let alone one that falls off the statue in Kael. But as he is in UI, I knew he would eventualy get it. A few weeks later I was grouped with a guildmate of his, and a old friend of both of ours and I had mentioned that they needed to get Ted that cloak, so I could get mine back, and guess what? I was told he got one a while ago. I told them they must be mistaken, as Ted wouldn't do that to me, there was just no way. I was then told to just go up and inspect him, that they knew for sure Ted had one. I was a bit hurt and highly ticked off, those that know me know I have a pretty bad temper, and can say stuff that I don't mean when angry so I didn't log on for a week to cool down. I loged on today to see that Ted was in Sol B, a place I could run in and see for myself, as most places UI hunts I would try to FD flop to. I get to Ted, and sure as hell he has the Cloak of the Falling stars on. I ask him if he sold or traded my cloak. He replied, &quot;is that what you came here for?&quot;. I told him yes, that I had been told he had gotten that cloak some time back and I could not believe that he would do that to me. So he tells me that he still has the cloak in his posesion. I talk to him a bit, and I get all kinds of &quot;excuses&quot; as to why I can't have my cloak back, even though he now has better. His answers are as follows &quot;I've had it too long&quot; (it has been 6-9 months now that he has had my cloak). &quot;You never talk to me anymore less it has to do with the cloak&quot;. Guess that negates the fact I gave you my cloak &quot;Till you got better&quot; and you have been useing it for a damn long time, holding out for a near impos. to get cloak. Not to mention the fact that he never even says hello to me when he logs on, and dosn't bother to respond to tells 90% of the time before I even asked about sometime hopefully sooner then later about receiveing my cloak back. I finaly sent him a tell again before the servers went down, tell was about as follows, /tell Ted I gave you my silbisian beseker cloak untill you got better, you have better now. Are you going to give me my cloak back, or are you going to make excuses to keep it? His response was something like &quot;It is on my girlfriends twink warrior now (we will call the girlfriend Meg to keep it short) and I'm not going to log her on to give you something that is hers. &quot;Something that is hers&quot; I give him a cloak to keep untill he gets better and he gives it to his girlfriends twink, Yea, I'm a bit off the edge now as I felt Meg was a friend too. He also told me we had no deal when I gave it to him, I guess saying &quot;you can have it till ya get better&quot; is no deal, just hit accept on the trade window and pretty much ignore me from then on. Guess the moral of this story is, Don't give stuff to friends till they get better, they will hold out for a near imposs. item to get and prob won't bother to give it back to you if they do get what they want, no matter how bad you need it. I've given away countless items to friends free and clear, this is the only time I've said &quot;till you get better&quot;, some of my friends have given me items back after getting stuff on thier own which I useualy give to others, you rarely see me in EC selling items, I give everything away to peeps I know will use it so can't afford to buy a item anywhere near the calibur of this particular cloak ( for those that know, ac 9, 9 str, stam, agil, dex. +50 hp, 25-30% haste {depending who you listen too, I know mine was faster then a rbg, could see the diff switching them, have had some tell me they parsed it 27-28%} 0.1 wieght. I guess I will close will now by just saying I am realy disapointed and hurt by those I thought were friends and warn you all of the same happening to you. Hope you all get what you are looking for out of your EQ experiance and pardon my piss poor spelling / grammer / english. Take care all!<br><br><br>Tarla Tragic<br>56 monk of E.

We were getting Zeppo's epic item from Kirn.  You walked up to me and gave put it in trade window and I said &quot;No, I will not take it.&quot;  Then you put it up again and said, &quot;Just take it, I wont use it anymore.&quot; or something along those lines.  Abuncha people saw you giving it to me.  <br><br>Then a little after that, maybe a week or so you quit EQ.  This was halfly because of Kemidra leaving EQ also.  I was about level 55 at the time.  Then in enough time to get from 55 to 60, and joining my current guild and being in it for about 6 months, without me hearing a word from you, except that you said you were back to Meg, and she telling me,  You say, &quot;Hi Ted, can I have my cloak back?&quot;.   Then after I said I was still using it, you disappeared about for a few weeks, not saying a word, not even showing up in /who.  <br><br>Then the day finally comes that I got my CoFS.  Were you in /who? no, were you on in a weeks time? no, were you on in a months time? no.  So finally deciding that you quit in my mind, and Yes, I did give my cloak to my girlfriend.  I am not going to against my actions in giving my girlfriend an item just because you decided to come back on a whim, after so long of a time and decide you want to play again.  World doesn't work that way. <br><br>Was it wrong of me? I dunno.  Some might think so, some might not.  I for one falls under the Not half.  You didn't play for over 8 months then come back on and not even saying where you were or anything, asking for the cloak back.  Then disappearing again.  <br><br>You can't give a &quot;friend&quot; a car. Go away for along time, then come back and tell the friend you wrecked your car, and need theirs back now... it won't work.<br><br>I'm sorry that it has to be this way Tarra..<br><br><br>Tedorn Nightshire<br>60 Monk<br>United Independent<br><br><br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ukragarn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kragarn</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 179<br> <font color=#E9D756>(1/3/02 5:44:21 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2856.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Sad tail of giving a friend a item &quot;Till he gets be</span><hr size=1> Ummm Tedorn yes you can in fact give a friend something, leave for an undetermined amount of time and then come back for it.  If in fact you are actually friends.  See that's what true friends actually do.  They help and support each other.<br><br>See how when you had no haste at all and he gave you his cloak.  Now matter which story is true, whether it was until you upgraded or just because he gave it to you, he now has no haste and you have extra haste.  Have you figured out where this is going yet??  When you had none he gave it to you, even if - in fact especially if - he just gave to you with no hope of getting it back, don't you think turn about is fair play???<br><br>I know when one of my true friends in the game returns I check my bank to see what I have that they can use.

I'm not a person who has acts like someone just pissed in my cornflakes over loot.  Loot to me in this game means shit.  Building friendships is what counts in the game.  I never sell stuff in EC because I give *everything* that I loot (which isn't much because I back out of almost everything, unless insisted upon) to friends, or nice people.  I've given locustlores, lamenations etc, for ports to places because loot means nothing (and I normally have no cash on me, being a monk and all).  <br><br>When she started to talk to me again when she returned from her &quot;Absence&quot;, all she wanted was the cloak.
