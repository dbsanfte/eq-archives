I’ve been there done that? Nahhhh.<br><br>As a level 57 Shaman (just recently attained) I can proudly say I’ve neither seen it all and have not, not never ever done it all. Yes I’ve tried to solo in Skyfire, but the less said about that the better ;]<br><br>While writing this I’ve no clue what I shall put into it or where it will go, hence why I’m posting it in the rants section. Most likely I’ll speak about the odds and ends that have come up during my EQ life, not that there are that many, not that many at all..<br><br>During my time I’ve made friends, I’ve seen friendships wither and die and I’ve seen friendships explode into hatred, which is never a good thing to see. The biggest point of EverQuest, for me at least is the community, thousands of people from all over the world coming together and playing one game, together. Yes of course there are always misunderstandings, arguments and even fights, as there is real life. Its inevitable that in this kind of environment, with the huge mix of cultures, knowledge and races that there will be ‘spats’ between groups.<br><br>As I’m now ‘high level’ I’ve been privy to some of the thoughts, ideas and memories of other people whom I am grateful too. Other people’s ideas are always and mostly vital to when someone thinks about the world as I am now. As I’ve noticed the high-end guilds, PC, MF, Magester, Affliction, the Asian guilds, Japanese guilds and more that I cannot remember or am to tired to even write down, all hold some grudge against each other. I myself hold a grudge against Divine Grace, which I will not go into or talk about no matter how much folk Spam or flame this post so don’t.<br><br>Now what I’m trying to ask, or rather rant about is why? Why do these guilds sometimes fight and clash, well in my opinion its because each guild is a collection of like minded people who sometimes disagree with what the other guilds think or plan. But as I’ve seen myself, when things get heavy or disaster happens we (and I mean most because there are some assholes out there) will come to the aid of a fellow player no matter what there guild tag is, no matter what they have done before or believe.<br><br>Now that’s out the way feel free to flame it as much as you like <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br>Next, hmm what’s next, what to do? Yes I think that is something close to what I wonder now. Now that I’m at the level of play that I’ve aimed and fought for, I ask myself. What now?<br><br>I started playing EverQuest when friends of mine introduced me to the game, now from that point I was hooked. The life of a Shaman both annoyed, yet interested me from day one. I won’t go into things like that now, but maybe some other day when I feel chatty I’ll sit down and write about things. Now Sharasali was tagged to Affliction, which I must say is that major factor as to why I set my goal to get high enough in level to join her in the ranks of Affliction. But as my level grew I meet and played with others from that guild and my intent to join grew in both strength and vigour. Last night I read those wonderful words ‘Welcome to level 57’ and almost instantly was invited by a friend and joined the ranks of Affliction as a perma trial member until I hit 60. My question is, what do I do next? What do I aim for? What do I strive for?<br><br>I doubt there is only one answer but I feel I should ask like this, mostly because I hope to get a wide range of ideas <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br>Another little thing that I know will be sharpened and then plunged into my back after I write this is the little thing about the sex of a character. Yes I am a guy playing a female Iksar character, what the hell is wrong with that? It’s a F**king ROLE PLAYING game for gods sake, so why all the bent asses and headaches?<br><br>I can understand it when some guy out there plays a character to far, or even pretends there female real life, but still, there are folk out there who neither pretend to be nor will ever say there female real life if asked, so why the hassle? It’s a topic for debate I think :/ I personally can’t see the ‘wrong’ in role playing a female in a game, a very well known role play game at that, but everyone has there thoughts on this so feel free <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br>Hmm what else, how else can I destroy myself here, not sure I can think of some so I’ll go take my shower.<br><br>Zakiku Kyuudousha, 57 Iksar shaman. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ukavissilversteel.showPublicProfile?language=EN>kavis Silversteel</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 121<br> <font color=#E9D756>(4/13/02 7:45:30 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3274.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ph33r the thoughts of a lizard.</span><hr size=1> As an officer of PC, we try not to get in other guilds ways, but sometimes that is just not plausible.

Not because anything is wrong with it, but because I had one myself. I made it to lvl 12, pretty much solo. I was happy, I just got SoW! The problem was, I was not paying attention when I created the character and did not realize I was FEMALE! I got invited to join a group and everything was going great until one of the people in the group started hitting on me. I was like WTF! That was when I realized my mistake. Regretfully, I deleted the character. Everyone knows that a good percentage of female characters are played by guys, but I personally could not see playing a char where I would have guys hitting on me forever.

It is normally with this mentality that a male playing a female character or a female playing a male character is looked upon with confusion.  This confusion usually generates itself in insults or harassment.  <br><br>I have not personally felt this, thankfully.  Being one of the few females to play this game, I actually play a female character....because to be honest the idea of playing a male character just didn't cross my mind when I started.  <br><br>As a side note, I came across a &quot;noob&quot; guide to EQ parody...the following quote seems appropriate:<br><!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>Step 2: Choose a Sex<br>Both sexes are equal as far as character abilities go. However, if you want other players to give you all sorts of free stuff, we strongly suggest you go with the female. Also keep in mind that if you are a male player, you are free to play a female character without fear of ridicule by the other players. Rest assured they have absolutely no way of knowing your true identity, so it is unlikely they will come to your home, camp out on your front lawn drinking beer and calling you a panty-wearing sissy boy. If you are female, on the other hand, we're afraid you simply *must* play a female character, as every other female player out there demands it. Sorry, but it is out of our hands. --Shadoe (shadoe@vaultnetwork.com) <br><hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br><br>I wish you many good adventures in the future as you'll see many exciting places with Affliction I'm sure.

I got kicked out of a guild due to RPing on emarr. As seen in my sig all my chars are shifty, underhanded and have god complexes (if you follow their lineage). Yet I am put down for playing as if I am always better then the next guy, hit harder then anyone or survive in the worst possible situations and brag about it. IRL I coudnt be a nicer guys and sure it comes out a bit IG ask anyone who knows me.<br><br>I have noticed on Emarr that RPing is not really tolerated, most want you to conform to their standards. Heck as a rogue I get that certain skill called "pickpocket" think I don't ever use it? VI gave Rogues that skill for a reason.<br>Heck I've even been called a Ninja looter by a few cause I looted a few pp/gp off a corpse after our group gets exp due to using mouse look for straffing, go figure that one.<br><br>The bottom line here is, or so it seems on Emarr, you can RP but the moment you offend someone with your RP prepare to here it from your officer/GM. <p><img border="0" src="http://members.bellatlantic.net/~dsenier/dsbanner.jpg" width="300" height="225"><BR><BR><b><a href="mailto:dsenier@bellatlantic.net">Dsenier Formidilosus</b> <i>Necromancer 57</i> (semi retired)<a href="mailto:dsenier@bellatlantic.net"></a> - <i>Click here to E-mail me</i><BR><b>Team Attollo</b> is:<BR><b>Xaell Attollo</b> <i>Rogue 57</i> (new Main)<br><b>Valens Attollo</b> <i>Cleric 54</i><BR><a href="http://pub5.ezboard.com/bthegreylegion"><img border="0" src="http://home.hiwaay.net/~brorex/greylegion/pix/gl_logo.jpg" width="169" height="28"></a><BR></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/bemarr.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=zakiku>Zakiku</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 8<br> <font color=#E9D756>(4/14/02 7:43:32 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3274.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ph33r the thoughts of a lizard.</span><hr size=1> /em breaks out the very large hammer of smacking and beats the popup adds to a bloody painful death. <br><br>/em sighs happily.<br><br>Thank you Siilverain, I do try to write a well scripted and written post. /blush.<br><br>Now then, I do realise that RP on EMarr is almost truly dead.
