    Wow, the effortless way that shit just pours off your fingertips without any bearing to the events of which you feel compelled to add your mindless drivel amazes me still.  Again, wow, I'm a troll!   And as such, per the world of EQ, I scratch my butt!!  You're fucking astounding!!   Come on, who pointed that out to you!!  I know someone *had* to have pointed that out, you didn't figure that out alone.  No way, you just aren't that bright!   My fridge light bulb is a lighthouse beacon by comparison.  Well let me clue you in, my name is SCRATCHER and it's based on that very JOKE!!   Stay with me, you see, you figured you could poke and use ass scratching as an insult because you were too ignorant to argue any points.   God, you are brilliant!!!   As if I didn't know that ass scratching/troll joke LOL.   Get a grip, and not the one you keep on yourself while you play EQ one handed.  ROFLMAO.<br>
<br>
<br>
    As for Xiqz, I've known him awhile, and no he didn't have anything to do with it LOL.   (Thought I'd back ya up there, bud lol)  Korarlei was led astray as well, and verified today talking to me that the situation was as Darikan had said, it was to have been randomed.   That changed when one of the other two clerics sent him a tell saying that it changed.  Being under all the raid stress of the moment, he didn't question it.  Its understandable.  Why would he think that someone chosen to go on a raid with him would be a lying selfcentered prick.  I think the issue is pretty well done.  Everyone knows what happened.   One or both of the other individuals took it upon themselves to change it.  Maybe they had been promised by Gywenth as was claimed or maybe not.  Whose to say and it don't matter.  When a raid forms, good folks leading honorable raids state the rules for everyone so there is no misconceptions.  Kor thought that was the case too.  And I don't know where Bridgecrusher got mixed in this.  I've yet to see him be an ass.   <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>

Who is truly the idiot? The fool, or the one who continues to entertain the fool? Hehehehe you really don't get it do you? Your opinion is meaningless to me, I simply plan to entertain myself and you provide that entertainment by replying to my childish posts.<br>
<br>
Concerning the whole Chardok thing. I have made my apologies to Darikan in person for using a sore situation to achieve self-entertainment. I was not there and don't have any opinion beyond that. <br>
<br>
Concerning the mindless scratcher fuck boy, You are too simple minded and slow to get the fact that you have been treated like the mindless puppet you truly are. How about you put your helmet back on and catch the short bus back to farm and quit trying to have battles of witticisms when you leave your weapons in your lunch box everytime.<br>
<br>
Oh yeah scratch punk boy, I will explain it to you slowly, I never had any intention of speaking about anything bearing to the events in chardok. My goal was simply to find some mindless and witless puppet like drone such as yourself with which to victimize. And being the dim-witted fool you are, you continued to feed into it. Again come back from fantasy into reality and no stop eating the tiny little mushrooms growing out of the prairie pies.<br>

I would like to thank scratcher for making me that I started getting defensive and have said some thins I might not have meant and may have insulted or hurt some people feelings I did not mean to.  <br>
<br>
Korarlei- I do not blame you.  As I said that night I also have led raids, I also have led pick up raids and I know the stress you were under.  I do believe you when say you had the same shroud pulled over your eyes as I did.  If you didn't mean the things you said about CoM the way I took them then I am sorry for that also.  I personaly feel like I owe someone somethign when I lead a raid and they get screwed and so I put pressure on you and that was wrong.  I am planning a my own, non pick up, raid on chardok.  If you would like to come and just be able to enjoy give me a tell in game.<br>
<br>
Bridgecrusher~ I have always had the utmost respect for you.  I don't even know at what point you became involved in this thread.  As far as I know you were just in charge of making the groups.  That is what I was told then before and after.  That is the reason I never said anything about loot to you.  Why this should hurt any friendship we did or could have had in game I don't know.  <br>
<br>
Gorndax~  I did not mean to say that you couldn't find 10 people to start your own guild.  I was very upset that I felt someone was telling me my guild sucked and the only thing I could do to achieve my goals was join yours.  I have the utmost respect for you and the things you have done.  Honestly I thought the reason you didn't have your guild was because you were just in the planning stages.  I never would doubt you could get 10 and if the GM's are aproving it now I wish you the best of luck.<br>
<br>
Sinangel~ Althought I cannot say with 100% certanty that you had nothing to do with it I honestly believe that you got duped to.  I don't think this is your fault.  I have known you for quite some time and Crom is the person who gave me your name and if your a friend of his I would be willing to bet your a person of charactor.  I never intended for anyone to think you ninja looted the scroll.  The leadership told you it was your and you took it.  In the same situation I would have done the same thing.  I am sorry to you if anyone has come down on you for this.  I don't believe your at fault.  I would also like to invite you to my chardok raid if you would like to join me give me a tell in game.<br>
<br>
Bekki~ Everything you say and do points a finger at yourself.  When I asked you in game why you told people I defaulted to sinangel you gave no response.  When I asked you 10 minutes later why you wouldn't respond and what gave you the right to change the loot rules you didn't respond.  Now go back and look at your post.  All yelling and accusation.  I don't know but where I come from when someone starts acting like that we usualy have found the guilty party.  I thought you had kids.  You should know that by now.  I can say with 99% certanty that you did this and you acted alone.  You disgust me and I hope I never have the displeasure of being in the same zone as you again.  You are a liar and horrible human being.<br>
<br>
To everyone else who's sole purpose in posting is to say it is just a game.  Your wrong and if you look deep inside yourself you will know it's more than a game.  For the most of us it is our break from reality.  It is our chance to step off of earth into norrath and be our charactors.  Who here hasn't gotten pissed when they got screwed.  Who hasn't gotten pissed when they didn't get a rez, or they looted everything and forgot to leave one item.  Who doesn't get mad every single time a GM says Cannot verify, cannot help.  To just about everyone this is more than a game this is a little piece of us.  Now maybe your going to say I belong on the FV server.  I hope not because I am not a role player but I do take what happens to Darikan as a little something that happens to me.  Think about it seriosly and be honest with yourself.  Most of you will agree with that.<br>

However, being that you are the type of guy to go out of your way to help someone and ask nothing in return, all I can say is, if you ever need help with anything let me know (such as going for your epic)... I may not be able to offer much but I'll be there for you dude.<br>

Once again another foolish hand puppet speaks out his ass. and cant help himself but to respond to this continued foolishness out of anger and spite. I'm not superior, just easily entertained. Can you really possibly take anything on this board seriously? hmmm You sir are very much a mental midget to really think what you have to say means anything to me other then simple entertainment. But go ahead respond again with righteous indignation, and spite, tell me how pathetic I am, It doesn't change the fact that you in your ignorance Nekiah, keep responding and in the end are no different than me. You sir/madam are just the tosspot calling the kettle black. But keep up the good work, I love the chuckles I get on my breaks from these things, as I hide behind my &quot;real life<br>
