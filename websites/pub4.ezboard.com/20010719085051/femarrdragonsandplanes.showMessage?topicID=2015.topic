The Coran and the muslim religion are 2 great things. It could be one of the most permissive religion, but the way people read the Coran make it one of the worst. BTW, same things can be said about the bible and the Torah (sp??).<br>

As such, they feel justified in their senseless (to me) actions.<br>
<br>
A few interesting articles over on CNN.COM detail how Omar is running the Taleban and controlling action in Afghanistan.<br>
<br>
This first article details the actions of the religious police in dealing with Donor Countries.  A few of these countries established hospitals in the area.  These same hospitals were raided, volunteers beaten, and eventually closed.  <br>
<br>

<br>
This second mentions the edict passed down from the Taliban, that requires a Hindu to be recognized by wearing a label.  This brings to mind, if we fail to learn from history, we are doomed to repeat it.  <br>

<br>
This final article details a few of the edicts mentioned in other posts.  No education for women, men are beaten for trimming their beards, women are required to wear a head to toe veil, and the yellow tag.  Interesting enough, the Taleban defend the tag requirement as protection for the Hindu from the religious police.  I seem to remember a similar justification from the 40's being made public.  For their protection....<br>

The Crusades...The Crusades were not a religious war, they were started because of the Catholic Church's greed. <br>
<br>
The Gulf War...Started because we like oil. Nuff Said. DIE FOR OIL!!!!!<br>
<br>
World War II...don't get me started.<br>
<br>
World War I...don't get me started, and shit, we were only in the war for less than a year...but then we went to russia to fight the EV0L COMMIES ARRR   !<br>
<br>
Civil War...Started because the south was trading cotton and other goods to europe, specifically, england. that pissed us right the hell off and we said none of dat. the south turned around and said &quot;we're pissed the hell off, we wanna be our own country to trade and make money!&quot; so they tried. Slavery was like, the 8th problem on the list.<br>
<br>
Current problems with PLO and Israel...PLO is pissed off because people bought land from them, which included Jerusalem, and said &quot;LETS MAKE OUR OWN COUNTRY CALLED THE NATION OF ISRAEL!! YES!&quot; without letting Palestine know. So, there goes all the money from vacationers, and a large chunk of land.<br>
<br>
I'm sure that culture and religion really might have a part in most wars, but most of em are simply greed. We got into WWII for the SOLE PURPOSE of making money. Why, you ask? we were trading with germany, japan, the &quot;allies&quot;, everyone...Japan gets pissed and bombs us (and we make a shitty movie about it), and we bomb them back o_O not only that, we make our own concentration camps, thus, making us look like hypocrites when we make movies that involve the holocaust. our camps weren't as bad tho...but we sure did screw these people over.<br>

<br>
the most potent of these causes has been successfully shown to be religion, or (to be more specific) any system of beliefs that are held on a large scale (i.e. patriotism)<br>
<br>
greed may be &quot;the start&quot; or core of the moving force, but a war is typically not fought by the populace for greed.  most who oppose war (because initially maybe they see it for what it is) can be later swayed by a religious or patriotic appeal that seems to &quot;make sense&quot; and validates the move.  <br>
<br>
along the same lines of these causes runs fear.  some people support a war because they fear their leader, and/or their countrymen if they are inactive more than they fear the enemy.  this is a rough one for me to grasp...<br>
<br>
so, in a sense, a very real one, religion and other widespread systematic beliefs, are a huge cause of wars, as they are what fuel the fire in the average person who may, or may not (quite dangerous) even know what they are really fighting for.<br>
<br>
it's a tough call, fighting in the name of &lt;insert whatever here&gt;, is what makes the war happen, it's what makes people lose rational thought enough to seek out others and kill them.  those wars mentioned above were not fought by the greedy ones who started the snowball, they were fought by people who believed in some cause strong enough for them to go perform acts they would normally (most likely) be against.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ukanya.showPublicProfile?language=EN>kanya</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 60<br> <font color=#E9D756>(6/13/01 9:27:49 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> oh yeah, p.s.</span><hr size=1> i don't disagree that greed is the formal cause, but in order to look at the big picture, it must first be complete and fill in.  wars are fought by too many people, and usually people (in general) have to be given someting to believe in to fight for.  i think it's an innate human justification scheme in order to absolve themselves for what they are about to do.  i don't think wars are fought FOR greed, even if they start that way.  too many people fighting them don't fully understand what they are fighting for beyond &quot;the actions of the nation we are going to war against towards &lt;fill in some body of people here&gt; are unacceptable, and we must step in to take action&quot;.  when, in fact, that may not be the reason at all, but they can't feed them the greed line, cause..well, i doubt that would bring enough fury to cloud judgement enough to start warring. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ucoroq.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Coroq</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 150<br> <font color=#E9D756>(6/13/01 9:40:08 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Modern day holocaust, WTF is up with this</span><hr size=1> No, the US will probably not take action, unless its interests are threatened. The US has tried to intervene pseudo-militarily in the affairs of (much weaker) countries several times in the past few years, Haiti, Somalia, the region formerly known as Yugoslavia, for example. But in these places one or more groups of people were actively killing as many people in the other group as they could (aka genocide). Of course, the US intervention was ill conceived, accomplished very little if anything, and generally sucked ass - but hey, they tried, and it wasn't for oil.<br>
<br>
The events in Afghanistan are bad sure, but not nearly this bad. In fact, hasn't Iran been worse for years? Islam is the law of the land, and you have no choice but to follow. I think that Iran and the other Islamic Fundamentalist countries in the region slacked off a little around the time that the Ayatola Khomeini (sp?) died, but in the last year or 2 the extremists have put their feet down again. No more wild Western behavior allowed, such as a woman donning her face covers and going to (ghasp!) a school to take a class.<br>
<br>
One thing that is really funny about these countries, is that if a woman is raped, her brothers, father, and all the men in her family do their best to kill her (with little or no legal reprocussions when succesful) for bringing shame upon her family. &quot;Why did you leave the house for 2 whole minutes without 2 or more men to escort you! Die slut!&quot; Very sweet.<br>
<br>
Of course the sweetest thing is that Christian Fundamentalists in the US (aka the Religeous Right) seem to really admire this, and strive to make the US like Iran (except replace Islam with Christianity). Errr, sorry for the tangent, but as a Libertarian who likes his freedoms, both the far left and the far right really scare me with their desires to be the thought police. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/udarueivywood.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Darue Ivywood</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 160<br> <font color=#E9D756>(6/13/01 9:44:51 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Modern day holocaust, WTF is up with this</span><hr size=1> This is just sad...very , VERY sad..<br>

In the end, once the internal conflict is forgotten, all sides will hate the outsider and you will have earned yet another cadre of enemies.  The US has learned this *everytime* it has poked it's proverbial nose in where it didn't belong.  <br>
<br>
We *should*, however, poke our nose in when we *do* have a vested interest.  Sorry, but this is the real world and a nation has an economic responsibility to it's citizens.  If our trade alliances are threatened, you damn well better believe that it justifies our involvement.  I am pretty sure that all of the doe-eyed, selectively liberal, anti-government, spoiled American citizens would be the FIRST ones bitching if they lost their subburban shopping paradises due to an economic crisis caused by a lack of US involvment in an overseas conflict; so yes, our boys have to die for oil so &quot;political activists&quot; can continue driving to rallies and protests in their friggin SUVs.  I have a lot of friends and family in the military and I hate that there is even a *chance* of them being sent into a fire-fight.  What pisses me off MORE though, is that they don't even get the proper respect from the people they are laying their lives on the line for.<br>
<br>
As for WWII, it's best to do a careful analysis of history before going off half-cocked.  WWII was one of the most complex conflicts in human history and cannot be easily summarized in a dozen lines on a stupid flame board.  Couple of points though:<br>
<br>
1) If you think that our *internment* camps of Japanese during WWII were *concentration* camps, then I suggest you watch &quot;The Rape of Nanking&quot;.  Hindsight is nice and easy, but when the Japanese were actively cooking Chinese babies on friggin campfires, the US was not necessarily totally unjustified in looking upon Japanese citizens with some suspicion.  Was it a dark time in American history? Yes.  Were American citizens treated unfairly? Yes.  Is it even a blip on the friggin radar compared to what Japan and Germany were doing? Not by a long shot.<br>
<br>
2) If there is ONE conflict that is NOT about greed, it is WWII.  WWII was about a demagogue gaining total control of a nation that had had it's pride stripped away.  Germany suffered badly after the end of WWI and it was inevitable that a jingoistic crack-pot would rise-up and sieze control.  The tragedy is, that the German people did not realize the extent of the damage until it was far too late.  MANY Germans died as a result of Hitlers accursed SS as well; that's just a fact that people choose to ignore in their demonization of Germany.<br>
<br>
Once Hitler had made it horribly clear that he was NOT going to be easily stopped in Western Europe, and Japan made it horribly clear that it viewed the US as an enemy, the US had no choice but to go to war.  It can be argued that we waited FAR too long to enter that conflict as our allies in Western Europe fell beneath the shadow of the iron cross. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/umitchtheblonde.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mitch The Blonde</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 1620<br> <font color=#E9D756>(6/13/01 1:47:06 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Modern day holocaust, WTF is up with this</span><hr size=1> ''I have read the bible and the Coran and still believe in nothing..

Interesting topic on the reason for wars.  You can go back in history as you like and in every war that looks, to the casual observer, to be religous, you will find underlying reasons of expansionalist/resource/materials goals.<br>
<br>

Calling the Qu'ran (or Koran) a "sequel" isn't entirely accurate, as it doesn't pick up where the Hebrew Scriptures or Christian Bible leave off.  Muslims do not believe that Jesus Christ was the Messiah, sent to save the world.  Muslims do not consider what Christians call the New Testament to be true.  Muslims consider Jews and Christians to be "People of the Book" and therefore, in most cases, respect the Jewish and Christian religions.  (Which doesn't mean that they don't respect other religions, just that they lend creedence to Judaism and Christianity.)  Muslims believe that they are decended from Abraham's son Ishmael, similar to the way that Jews believe they are decended from Abraham's son Isaac.  Muslims hold many beliefs that are similar to Jewish and Christian beliefs, but they also hold many that are very different.<br>
It is when a group like the Taliban forces these very different beliefs on a populace that Islam suddenly seems drastically different from Judaism and Chrisitianity.  It is when groups like the Taliban begin to persecute certain groups (women, Hindus) that we are shocked.  Will the US take action?  No.  We don't interfere in Ethnic Cleansing, except to offer a pitiful amount of help to those who manage to escape -- and most of what we offer isn't government funded.  Until the actions of the Taliban begin to affect us in some way, we will continue to ignore what happens under their rule.<br>
Of course, this begs the question of whether or not we even have the right to interfere.  But that's an entirely different post.<br>
BTW, Mitch, it's spelled atheist.<br>

Ever since the start of the cold war, however, political and guerilla tactics have become a large part of the enemy's arsenal. Where the distinction between real and imagined enemies became prevalent, i couldn't tell you, but it happened.  This is where we got the idea of a "terrorist".  Terrorists are people that fuck with your head, are always a threat, and whom you will never see.  They inspire terror through their anonymity and guerilla tactics.  The only problem with this is that when you begin calling someone a terrorist it removes their previous identity.  For example:  Palestinians weren't terrorists before the creation of Israel, then when Israel won its independence and the Palestinians still were opposed to this fact they became terrorists.  Vocal and violent dissension to any culture becomes terrorism to a degree. It's a tool.  Yassar Arafat was labeled a terrorist by the US in the 70's, then he wont a Nobel Peace Prize.  Identities change over tiem :P  Ok, to the current situation in Afghanistan..<br>
<br>
Had a girl in my class that came from Afghanistan, a class where we talked about the distinction between dissent and 'terrorism'.  According to her, yeah, they are ruling with an iron fist, and none of it can be very supported by the Koran.  They fear loss of power, just as Iran had for many years.  Iran is becoming more moderate though, especially with the last elections.  Afghanistan is beginning to replace them as a "rogue" nation.  Note, this term "rogue nation" only came into existence relative to fundamentalist regimes that we consider an enemy.  By calling these countries "rogue nations" you remove said country from the possibility of having rational political relations.  That is, a rogue nation cannot be dealt with, it is apart from the civilized community of nations, etc.  This is exactly what happens when we examine "terrorists" ... a terrorist can have no place in a discourse involving the things he/she is fighting for because by the fact that they have been identified as a terrorist their view is invalid, not relevant.  They are effectively taken out of the debate.  The same occurs with rogue nations.  It's a tool to seperate and dehumanize people.  I dunno, i thought this is an interesting fact...<br>

Some points to make (beyind laughing at your ignorance).<br>
<br>
a) Afghanistan is a sovereign country. <br>
<br>
b) The US needs to get its house in order first. (The only country that &quot;executes&quot; more of its own citizens is China. Nice company for a democracy to keep).<br>
<br>
c) The reason for the &quot;markers&quot; is so that non-Muslims don't get harassed by the religous police. (Unlike the US where everyone including the game-players are valid targets for the self-appointed religous police.)<br>
<br>
d) I think it's pretty rich the people from the US getting hot and bothered about other countries destroying their cultural heritage. What's left of your &quot;native&quot;-american culture huh ?<br>

Most of the wars he stated were fought for greed had nothing to do with wealth. Just the means to attain wealth. <br>
<br>
Another point is that we as American's can't be the world police for every half-witted, third world nation out there. They have the right to run their countries as they see fit, no matter how much we, as freedom loving patriots, disagree with it. I know that this is very similar to the Jews in Germany and am just as upset that this is happening but if our goverment were to step in at this point and try to do something about it we'd have every Islamic country as well as a few of our allies screaming bloody murder. When it becomes a point of genocide or ethnic cleansing, (Like Yugoslavia was) then, with the promission of the UN Security Council, the US be able to step in and try to stop it.<br>
<br>
At this point, from what I've read on this topic from this board, it seems they are required to wear the yellow patches for their own protection. From what I've read, many, many months ago, a woman not covering her face, or showing a bit of ankle, can be shot right there in the street. I may be wrong but if their religious beliefs are that strict, who are we, the country founded on freedom of religion, to say they can't do it. In Arabic countries it is legal for a father to murder his own children if they disobey him. Do we yell about that? It happens everyday. <br>
<br>
I saw a video of a convicted thief in Iraq having his hand cut off as punishment for stealing 13 dollars and a color T.V. from his brother. Barbaric? Sure. Another culture allows for a girl coming into womanhood to be held down while her clitoris is cut off with a razor and her vagina sewn shut. All because it is custom for the man to be sure she is a virgin on her wedding night by cutting her vagina open himself. Removal of the Clitoris is because they believe that a woman shouldn't enjoy sex. If she does she will cheat on her husband. I forget the country this happens in but it does happen, every day. <br>
<br>
We can't stop all of these things because we feel its not right. These beliefs have formed over 100's, sometimes 1000's of years and are so ingrained in cultures that you'd have to spend Trillions of dollars on education only to fail.<br>
<br>
Whatta ya gonna do?<br>

I am jewish, so i might  be a little bias about this, but i would like all of you guys to read this quote:<br>
&quot;When they came for the Communists, i didn't speak up because i wasn't a communist,<br>
When they came for the Jews i didn't speak up because i wasn't a jew,<br>
when they came for the trade unionists, i didn't speak up because i wasn't a trade unionist,<br>
when they came for the cathlics i didn't speak up because i wasn't a cathlic,<br>
and then they came for me, and by then there was noone left to speak up.&quot;<br>
<br>
also, &quot;inhumanity anywhere equals inhumanity everywhere&quot;<br>
We are all humans, in no way should we let this happen again<br>
