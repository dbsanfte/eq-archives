I completely agree.  However, its probably that we might call it two or three different things.  Personally, I believe that 'true' perception or 'oneness' if you will, is a result of the union of love and truth, and once this union is thouroughly achieved, (this is only a theory) We move on towards the next step which is a union with God(a kind of 'bond' if you will) [I know that sounds a bit backwards from the 'Christianity' thing, whereby people think the only thing important in life is to make sure you are 'saved'].  Yes I believe in afterlife.  I believe in God.  I believe that I'm cool with him and all that.  I believe I am 'saved'.  BUT, I want more out of my life and relationship/union with God.  While the union of this relatioship is 'key' IMO, I continually work to understand.  I am not a walking zombie and will never be one.  THAT is why I see the beauty in what others say/do.  THERE is more to life than my piddly brain.   Quote Lurikeen-   &quot;Some argue that 2 and 3 really are the same&quot;   I COMPLETELY agree.  Here is how I see that statement:  Love=1 Truth=2 and spirituality=3.  Love is obvious and so is Truth.   Spirituality(IMO), as the 'union' of these two, travels beyond, or transcends the 'ignorance of 'love' and the arrogance of 'truth'.  PLEASE allow me to explain that in simple terms.  Truth, without love is arrogant.  Love without truth is ignorant.  There is a 'necassary' balance between the two.  This 'perfect' balance is spirituality.  <br>
     Now, that statement, definetly asks this so-called term, 'perfection', to tear it to pieces.  BUT IMO, perfection is not a judgement of truth(thought, whatever ya call it) as most people percieve it to be.  THIS is the temptation of our 'scientific' revolution.  I think science is wonderful and believe that it is a necassary component of our evolution(that word not meant physically).  Ahh crud gotta go.     <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ulurikeen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lurikeen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 66<br> <font color=#E9D756>(12/3/01 6:49:30 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=138.topic&index=346>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Powerful statement</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> &quot;My take of what you said: existence is based on a union of 'something' or 'SUMthing' and this union creates being,existence,life(whatever its called).&quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

What am I saying about &quot;existence&quot;? Not much really. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Let me seperate out two ideas I have and please knock them around a bit. There is no such thing as &quot;Existence&quot; in and of itself. There are worlds that contain things (like you and I) and one of those worlds is the *actual* world (btw, a &quot;world&quot; is simply a collection) and all the rest of them are &quot;possible worlds&quot;. What is actual is what is real and what exists. The actual world is that which contains instances of logically possible concepts. For example, the actual world doesn't contain an instance of a &quot;round-square&quot; because that is not possible; in fact, &quot;round-squares&quot; are not even real. However, the concept &quot;human being&quot; does have instances. Human beings are both real and exist. That is to say the concept is coherent and there is an instance of it. Let me toss this out while I am here.... The concept of &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot; is coherent. So, Sherlock is real, but does he exist? As far as we know there are no instances of the concept anywhere, so the easy answer is he does not exist.<br>
<br>
Concerning the remainder of your post, you have some well thought out ideas. I agree that passion must walk alongside the dryness of truth. I also agree that when one attempts to lose emotional content (what you refer to as &quot;spirituality&quot;) they have lost out. At the end of reason are two types of people, in my opinion: 1) dead ones 2) living one. Those who keep passion in their lives are alive.<br>

I will not leave aside what you are writing about &quot;perfection&quot; until you can elaborate more on the topic. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>Lurikeen Mali'Kyre<BR>

Yep I completely agree and this is why I feel so strongly about God, Jesus, after life and all that.  People fear God beacuse they think they won't be able to feel.  WHen in fact that would be far from making any sense to a being who has made us with the idea of friendship.  I am not going to be walking around like some zombie creating the perfect marble sphere and farming my lot.  Where is the balance of love and truth there?  There isn't one.  Yep, without feelings what is there to live for.  There would be no free will.  It just doesn't make any sense.  Everything is important.  Everything will be involved.  I believe there are so many enjoyable things in society that have been perverted by people.  People then wonder, &quot;will i be able to fuck my wife in the mouth in heaven?&quot;  well, if sodomizing your wife is a balnce of love and truth then I guess so.  Will it be like sex, drugs and rock'n'roll?  No cause there is no balance there either(truth gone out the window).  Will there be feelings which equate with sex, music, celebration etc.... yea there will.  They just won't be sodomizing your wife.  Will I be sticking my cock in someone's poop-shoot?  Well, I don't now and don't intend on it anytime.  Will exciting sex exist.  Sure it will.  Passion will be the rule of thumb rather than lust.  Lust is a perverse form of love.  Will I play computer games.  Hmm I think we will be forever inventing things, searching, exploring this universe and the next(yea scientists agree that there are, not only millions of galaxies but more universes out there as well).  Do I believe the universe will be occupied and explored.  Well I think I am rambling now.  I hope I answered your question with clarity Lurikeen.  <br>

I think I see what you are saying, now. I think we agree that motion is involved in our sense of time. &quot;Perfection&quot; has always been problematic for me, though. We can logically analyze and empirically analyze items in the world, but how would we judge something as being the &quot;most perfect&quot;. It would be like grading the quality of diamonds. We can only compare those items within the realm of our experiences. Anything outside experience (not in strictly an empirical sense of the word) can't possibly be used in our analysis of perfections. In short, we don't know what the scale could possibly look like, so our talk of perfections become vacuous. I believe the philosopher David Hume covers this very well in his  &quot;Enquiry conerning the Principle of Human Understanding&quot; and in his &quot;Treatise of Human Nature&quot;. Immanuel Kant also covers ideas over &quot;perfections&quot; in his &quot;Critique of Pure Reason&quot;.<br>

Example:  Imagine something you have never seen, touched, smelled, heard, tasted.  For example, pussy.  Remember the first time you ate one?  I don't remember what the environment was but I remember how I felt after I licked her suzy.  Sounds kind of off the topic but its not.  IMO perfection(the way we view it) happens in its physical sense.  It just happens on such a miniscule scale of time that we don't notice it.  Imagine if you will, your at a stop light.  Your taking a u-turn and so are two cars opposite of you.  You see there blinkers and their timing is programed at different rates.  BUT, eventually you will notice when they blink at the same time.  Of course its highly unlikely that they really did.  Our eyes aren't a very good judge for most process'.  However lets pretend that the blinkers are some type of energy release from two different energy sources(stars possibly)  Fluctuations of their energy(mabye a solar flare type thing)  These 2 different systems are generally independent but not 'purely' independent.  They somehow feed or shed off each others 'process'.  There are so many factors that we don't know about how these two 'systems' are affecting others but, eventually something will happen along the life of its process that creates a (hmmm whats the word) harmonious condition called, 'perfection'.  I guess one could compare it to our 'prime'.  Some peps say its around mid-twenties.  Whatever, its different for everyone.  But you see what I mean.  So, perfection is in the process and not the conclusion.  (recapping a little).  So I believe in a perfection for the natural world.  And I guess there is one for humans(in their physical sense) as well.  ( I will expand more on this)<br>

<br>
Perfection in its &quot;physical sense&quot; as opposed to another sense of the word? I understand to some extent what you are saying about the harmony of the blinkers in your example so let me respond there.<br>
<br>
I think you may be saying something like the blinkers share a property of &quot;harmonius blinking&quot; for a short duration of time. The property of blinking in harmony is a example of what &quot;perfection&quot; means. Something like that?<br>
<br>
If so, then time may be extraneous to your claim. Further, you would be in good company with Platonists through the ages who believe there are things that exist called &quot;universals&quot; (Plato calls them &quot;Idea Forms&quot;). The Platonist view of Universals is that shared properties of a class are the expression of a form. For example, if you have Red hair and I have Red hair the shared property of &quot;Redness&quot; is the expression of the form &quot;Red&quot;. It is Plato's &quot;Idea Forms&quot; that evolves into the ideas of &quot;perfection&quot;. If I have &quot;red&quot; hair and you have &quot;red&quot; hair, then there must be an ideal color of &quot;red&quot;, some think.<br>
<br>
Suffice it to say there are numerous problems with that view (imo). One large problem deal with how we could possibly know what the Idea Form &quot;red&quot; is. A deeper issue is what should the scale look like with Idea Red at the top and what at the bottom and in between? Lastly, how would we overcome perceptions of red (for example) to determine the Idea Form of Red? How I see &quot;red&quot; will differ from how you see that color. If Quantum Mechanics has shown anything at all it has demonstrated the realitivity of measurement. How we measure properties (like &quot;red) is contingent upon our physical construction. O.k., this post is too long now. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <p>Lurikeen Mali'Kyre<BR>

And how many different types of 'vision' exist?  Many types we know of CAN'T see the color red so red DOESN'T exist.  Thnx for supporting my other post.  You put better than I could have.<br>

  IT Sure has.  Again, perspective.  All that shit you see is there and isn't there.  I mean come ON.  If we know of things we can't see, hear, touch, smell, taste etc.. then its reasonable(at least beyond the logic of a dog) that uuther things are there which we can't see.  Another dimension?  One based on 'thigns' we have have never sensed before?  or things we have never imagined?  Possibly a 'universe' that exists on something called Positurectal?  (Not a Freudian slip btw)  Complete creativity.  How does pure creativity correlate to perfection?  How does perfection relate to time?  And how does Pure Creativity relate to 'law'(law meaning boundary in the very generalist of senses)  Now we are getting into some cool shit.

Yes, I agree that it is possible there is more to the universe than what we experience with the senses. In fact, I know there are things like sub-atomic particles which I have never directly experienced. How do I know? Through use of analytical reasoning.<br>
<br>
Funny thing is, as far as I know I have never heard of anyone coming to believe in god through use of sheer reason or sensory experience. Most believers I have met form a belief in god at a very young age. Usually because their parents believe. I have met some who &quot;come to god&quot; because of the depravity they feel associated with their past behaviors (e.g. masturbation, drunkeness, looking at Playboy...). Such people come to believe in a &quot;perfect being&quot; only because they see themselves as less than the ideal self, the archetype of self that cultures (and sub-cultures) like to foist upon individuals usually through some moral system. Any way....<br>
<br>
I can't really lend much to the topic of &quot;perfection&quot; only because I believe &quot;perfection&quot; is a chimera! It is just a figment of the mind. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>Lurikeen Mali'Kyre<BR>
