There is much more to it than that of course - and tons of data is collected daily...<br>

Someday there will be a pill to stop people like Mitch and Chieting(however you spell his name) from having chaotic delusions of grandure here on the message boards...  we'll all thank Dwark for that.<br>

The fact of the matter is even if Iizzard doesnt quit, what control do we have over him? None, Enantiomer himself roled the random and Iizzard had/has/destroyed/sold the item. only thing left for us to do is learn from this and move on.<br>
<br>
What we did have control over though is the ability to try and end continual bashing and calling names in our guild, the decision was made and Enantiomer was removed. what will happen next? I am not sure but I am sure that it will keep you up at night untill we inform you. If you are truely concerned with the actions of a guild you do not belong to send me a tell in a week and I will inform you and maybe you can sell the copyright for a mini series or seomthing. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uneebbo.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Neebbo</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 81<br> <font color=#E9D756>(5/8/02 9:19:02 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3329.topic&index=43>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: End the petty squabble and move on, Jesus</span><hr size=1>   Sorry, Beneg, but no matter how eager Enan may have been to air dirty laundry, the fault clearly rests with Iizzard. He could have pressed for the item to be randomed to all. He could have told the guild he was planning a price check (he had to have known about it). He also has &quot;quit&quot; over this, keeping the item, and seems to basically be running away from his guilt. <br>
<br>
  I don't know any of the people from CD whatsoever. That's just how it appears to me. Perhaps Enan moved too quickly, but his motives seemed good - namely keeping another guild from tearing up over apparent &quot;loot whoring&quot; of a pricey luxury item. The fact that as you say the other officers haven't been playing much left him the role of de facto guild leader. Frankly, he should have requested that position, or not taken the added responsibility of being sole officer.<br>
<br>
  Iizzard has the same posting style as Othyum, and both of them could use some coherency to their posts. I have a hard time even understanding them, and that certainly hurts their case. Their numerous attempts to shift the blame also just reek of guilt. If they had a good reason, they wouldn't need to throw in every facetious argument they could think up. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uthrasy.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Thrasy</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.cachelaw.com/~bhadfield/leafpic.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 14<br> <font color=#E9D756>(5/8/02 9:25:50 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3329.topic&index=44>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: End the petty squabble and move on, Jesus</span><hr size=1> Iizzard posted that he SOLD the item Beneg.

Actually Raedwulf, Iizzard’s posts were not lacking punctuation.

Enantiomer did try and control the situation, as he should have, as one of the only officers that had the information at the time. However, after he started his probe into things lashing out on anyone that had an opinion any different then his own is what killed him. Time and time again different people tried to explain what they thought was going on or that they had handled the issue before he went on his rampage.<br>
<br>
The issue of him asking for more power in the guild as he was one of the only really active officers day in and day out would have been for not, because of his excessive abusiveness of the power that his had as just a normal officer. <br>
<br>
Also to respond to Thrasy’s comment early and maybe explain a bit further too.  Enantiomer himself has removed three people from the guild with no meeting/conversation with another officer or the guild leader. This is no way trying to say his removal wasn’t talked over as I talked to all the officers and guild leader myself and knew it was coming.<br>

Sorry, spunky, but I understood everything that was stated in English.  Some of Iizzard's stuff was unintelligible, but I'm pretty sure I figured out the gist of it.  I read the posts really slowly (necessary when people are spouting gibberish).  If you can point out a specific post which includes something contrary to what I've stated and which I clearly didn't understand, please do so.  Failing that, you're just typing out your ass.<br>
<br>
So now Iizzard hasn't quit?  Please try and be consistent.  You said he quit already, even though he said only that &quot;he'd probably quit&quot; [translated into English for the dewd-impaired].  <br>
<br>
What control do you have?  Hmmm, demand he give it back?  Kick him, not Enantiomer, out of the guild?  Do the same to the others that were complicit in his conduct?<br>
<br>
The &quot;mini-series&quot; thing was pretty clever.  I've never heard that one before.  Bravo.  Completely irrelevant to the facts or anything I've stated, but clever nonetheless.  The point is that this situation was brought to the board by Iizzard and Oth trying to sell the lewt.  Your guild's action to kick Enan out (and replace him with you), removed this from being a guild only issue, by removing the forum in which Enan could correct the situation.<br>

Did I ever say that it was sold to you?  Beneg, dude, what on earth?  I have no idea what you are talking about.  I admit that I made a reference (on GUILD pages) that it smelled like a conspiracy.  It looks like a conspiracy.  I have no knowledge that it is a conspiracy and I sure had no idea that you might be involved.<br>
<br>
However, your posts make this all seem more plausible.  How you managed to be involved in this decision, I'll never know.  None of you have addressed the simple fact.<br>
<br>
Iizzard tried to screw the guild.  He's happy about it too.<br>
<br>
Enantiomer abusing power, please.  If you know Enantiomer you know how he is.  He CAN fly off the handle.  Especially when someone like you demands that the guild does VSR for someone whose faction is a mess and a freaking lowby level ranger.  Then you berated him on guild.  Enantiomer kicked you because of your actions.  The officers should have supported him.<br>
<br>
Don't try to blame Enantiomer, Beneg.  He acted PURELY IN THE INTEREST OF THE GUILD AND GOT NO SUPPORT.  I think now that it is all because of you.<br>
<br>
You, Beneg, are apparently Mr. Keefer in Truely's analogy. I throw my champagne in your face.<br>

The way people write on the internet is horrendous, so it's not always easy to get your point across.<br>

His removel was put to a vote. He was not removed because we found he was wrong in rolling the amulet to iizzard. I dont think he was wrong in rolling the amulet to iizzard, he simply did not have enough information, and at the point he did the random i dident have the information so i might have done the same thing.  In the past he has removed members cause he was mad at them without trying to work it out or even talking to other officers who were on at the time. He also moved the topic on the officers board to a public forum before we had time  to resolve the mater. From my viewpoint he was using this issue to cause strife in the guild. Ne never poasted a solution, or even made an atempt to resolve the mater, all i saw was him throwing more fule on the fire, and that was the straw that broke the cammels back and I called his removel be put to a vote. My official stance on his removel is misuse of his authority as an officer. I am sorry it has come to this and i wish we had been able to work it out but people were taking sides and steps had to be taken. Iizzards actions will be evaulated once we can get the full story, which i still belive has not come into full light, and he will be held accountable if he is found at fault but we will investigate the mater first and flame him second if it comes to it. =p<br>

That sounds like a solution to me, Redawen.  Too bad instead of Iizzard agreeing and saying it was a plausible idea, he said this....<br>

What more investigation do you need?  Read Iizzard's own posts.  He took a NBG item won on a guild raid, and then sold it.  When Enan confronted him, he lied (the whole crap about just posting a PC).<br>
<br>
Of course Enan wasn't booted because he rolled the item to Iizzard.  Nice attempt at misdirection.  You booted him because he challenged the rest of the officers in a sweetheart deal to Iizzard.<br>
<br>
He never posted a solution or tried to work it out?  Wow!  Which thread did you obtain that from, the Ostrich Forum?  Sure looked like he was doing both. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=96910">My Crappy Stuff</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uthrasy.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Thrasy</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.cachelaw.com/~bhadfield/leafpic.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 17<br> <font color=#E9D756>(5/8/02 11:19:19 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3329.topic&index=58>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Chaotic Delusions, I didn't want to do this.../sigh</span><hr size=1> Redawen, you did tons to help this situation too, didn't you.  *Please note obvious sarcasm*<br>

That was your FIRST response to this situation anywhere on the guild pages, officer or otherwise.  Enan did move an officer page to the guild only page, this happened AFTER you called a vote and stepped the whole confrontation up.  Don't try to come away from this clean, buddy.
