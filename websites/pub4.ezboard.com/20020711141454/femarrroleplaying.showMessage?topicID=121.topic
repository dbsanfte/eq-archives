Having adventured for many weeks, we had finally<br>arrived home in the city of Neriak, yet the moment we entered he had run off, telling me only<br>that &quot;he had things he must attend to now that we were home.&quot;  Having known him for only a<br>short while, and having never been in Neriak with him before, I was unable to even begin to<br>guess at what he was about.  I had yet to even meet the other members of my guild, yet the<br>Commander assures me that they have been watching.<br><br>As unnerving as I found this, I was yet unwilling to admit that I was afraid of our meeting.<br>This very eve I would finally meet those I called &quot;Brothers&quot;.. I was to attend our monthly<br>meeting, known as the &quot;Meeting of the Moon&quot;.  I had yet no idea as to what this would mean,<br>being told only to wear my finest armor and do my best before them.<br><br>Suddenly, as if out of no where, Ashrad appeared.  He had a habit of doing this, rather<br>unnerving, a habit he shared, oddly enough, with the Commander himself.  Many of their habits<br>were similar, yet their personalities varied completely.  The Commander, a stoic man, had little<br>in the way of emotion, beyond this loyalty to The Cimmerii.  Ashrad, on the other hand, had an<br>overabundance of emotion.  Apt to throwing fits at any moment, he could never to counted on to<br>be the same from moment to moment.  Oddly enough, it was as if they were each half of a person,<br>once joined and now separated for all time.. indeed, The Commander called Ashrad his<br>&quot;soul-brother&quot; but as yet I was unsure of what that meant.  They also showed marked similarity<br>in appearance and speech pattern.. <br><br>Puffing and out of breath, Ashrad was trying to tell me something, apparently something he<br>considered of great importance.  &quot;Lith....Lith....Lithi...&quot; he said &quot;I&quot; *puff* &quot;have something&quot;<br>*gasp* &quot;I MUST tell you!!&quot; he choked out finally.  &quot;What IS it?!&quot; I asked &quot;You have been gone<br>for hours, and now you come to me, unable to breathe, and tell me that you have something to<br>tell me, well, SPIT IT OUT!&quot; I yelled &quot;I have been looking all OVER for you!&quot; <br><br>&quot;Lithi&quot; he said, at this point I was beginning to become impatient, &quot;how many times does he<br>really need to repeat my name?&quot; I thought to myself.  &quot;The Commander *gasp* he is calling for<br>you!&quot; At this he began to drag me toward a tunnel, leading downward further into Neriak.  &quot;What<br>does he want?&quot; I looked shocked &quot;I thought we had another two hours till the meeting?!?&quot; <br><br>His breathing finally calmed, Ashrad looked back at me &quot;Apparently he has decided to move it up<br>a little...they are all assembled&quot; He stopped suddenly and looked me over.  Suddenly I realized<br>how I must look to him.  Dusty and covered in blood from weeks of fighting, I had yet to manage<br>to get clean.  My intention had been to find an inn when he returned and get cleaned up but<br>apparently I would not be able to accomplish that. Frowning at me he said &quot;do you have another<br>set of armor laying around?&quot;<br><br>Shaking my head and looking worried I stared back at him, &quot;this is the only one I own... I was<br>told I would get new armor if I became Cimmerii...&quot; I was starting to get upset &quot;I can't go<br>looking like this! There is NO WAY they will want me as a part of the group.  The Commander<br>says we must always look our best to show our honor for the guild, but......but......&quot; I<br>trailed off looking distraught. &quot;Well&quot; he said, &quot;I would let you borrow mine, but they won't<br>fit you.&quot;  Taking me to a fountain nearby he started to scrub the mess off my armor.  Ten<br>minutes later he was finished. Standing back he took a good look at me &quot;much better&quot; he said,<br>smiling to himself.  Looking down into the pool I suddenly felt much better, he had managed to<br>get almost all the blood and dirt off my armor and had even managed to straighten out the mess<br>on top of my head called my hair.  &quot;Well, that's the best I can do&quot; he said &quot;let's go&quot;.<br><br>I followed him through a row of shops and into a courtyard.  Suddenly I remember where I was..<br>this had looked new to me till this moment, as I still had not regained my memory, but this I<br>knew all to well.  &quot;The Arena..&quot; I breathed &quot;Home of the Indigo Brotherhood....&quot; I faltered.<br>I had not been here since before I had lost my memory and been found by the Commander, what<br>would my elders say and think.... Ashrad took my hand and began to drag me through the<br>building.  Finally, we can to the arena, where I had many times clashed swords with my fellow<br>warriors.<br><br>&quot;Vendui Lady Lithiano&quot; came a voice from above me. &quot;Welcome to 'The Meeting of the Moon'&quot;<br>Suddenly, The Commander appeared before me. Again, I had the eerie impression that he and Ashrad<br>were too alike for my liking.  I saluted crisply and knelt before him.  &quot;Vendui Commander,<br>thank you for your kind welcome.  What do you wish of me?&quot;<br><br>&quot;You are here to see if you have proven yourself to myself and the other Cimmerii&quot;  out of the<br>shadows they began to appear... Women and men of my age and older, all wearing their &quot;Blood<br>Sashes&quot;.  &quot;These are the Cimmerii&quot; I thought to myself... &quot;and aptly named..&quot;<br><br>&quot;Vendui Sister Lithiano&quot; they said in unison.  &quot;You and your Brother, Ashrad, are here to be<br>judged.  We will soon find out if you are worth of the name, Cimmerii.&quot;  Feeling very daunted<br>and afraid, I strode into the center of the ring, attempting to appear confident.  &quot;A warrior<br>must never falter in the face of a greater opponent&quot; I thought to myself.. a statement that one<br>of my previous master would make us repeat over and over and over when we showed any sign of<br>weakness.<br><br>Smiling slightly, Ashrad followed.  He appeared more confident than myself, but I knew this was<br>not the truth of it.. he was more afraid than I, as he had been scrutinized by The Commander<br>much more heavily than myself..twas as if the Commander were testing him, seeing if he would<br>break or falter.<br><br>Standing at the center of the ring, I turned and faced The Commander, &quot;Lady Lithiano&quot; he said<br>&quot;myself and those gathered here, feel that you have shown yourself to be worth of entering our<br>Brotherhood.  You know our rules and our laws and have upheld them with exemplary grace. You do<br>us proud.  Do you wish to enter the Brotherhood of The Cimmerii?&quot;  almost unable to contain my<br>excitement I said &quot;Aye Commander, I have no other wish than to be Cimmerii, for now, for ever,<br>and for always.&quot;  <br><br>He moved towards me pulled out a bag that I had not seen before.  Opening it carefully, as if<br>it were a sacred object, he gently removed a &quot;Blood Sash&quot;.  Embroidered carefully on one edge<br>were the words &quot;Lithiano Kia’ahna, Sister of the Cimmerii&quot;  Placing the bag back into his<br>backpack to crossed the rest of the distance to me.  Raising his hands above his head, he<br>carefully placed the sash over my head.  He took one step backwards and saluted. &quot;Welcome to<br>The Cimmerii Lady Lithiano, you are most welcome here.&quot;  I carefully adjusted the sash to the<br>correct position and saluted.  I then turned and bowed to each member in turn.  &quot;Thank you all<br>for accepting me, I will do my best to be all that you have hoped.  I uphold the ideals and<br>rules of the Cimmerii, for all time.&quot;<br><br>I stepped carefully out of the ring and took my place between Brother Ghuarboktumawg, an ogre,<br>and Sister Charmian, a fellow Drow.  The Commander repeated the procedure with Ashrad,<br>inducting him into the Cimmerii and welcoming him to the Brotherhood.<br><br>As Ashrad stepped out of the ring a cheer swept the crowd.  We were suddenly surrounded by our new Brothers and Sisters.  The celebration  continued late into the night.  We were finally, truly, members of The Cimmerii.  Elated and exhausted we eventually retired late that night.  Twas truly a night to remember.<br><br>Since that night I have had the pleasure to welcome many others in this way.  Hopefully we will soon welcome many more.<br> <p>Lithiano Kia'ahna<BR> Commander of The Cimmerii<BR>23rd Season Warrior<BR> Member of SIN<BR>Member of The Council of Guilds</p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrroleplaying.showPrevMessage?topicID=121.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrroleplaying.showNextMessage?topicID=121.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrroleplaying.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=121.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/gfx/addReply1.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrroleplaying.emailToFriend?topicID=121.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrroleplaying.threadControl?topicID=121.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/deleteThreadFire.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrroleplaying.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=121.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrroleplaying.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=121.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub4.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="emarrmessageboardrules">Message Board Rules<option value="emarrlinks">Links<option value="emarrupcomingmmorpgs">Upcoming MMOG's<option value="emarrfrm18">America Under Attack<option value="emarrfrm19">Dark Age of Camelot<option value="emarrgeneral">General<option value="emarrfrm17">Funny Stuff<option value="emarrbazaar">Item Bazaar<option value="emarrscrollsnspells">Spell Bazaar<option value="emarrfrm15">Shiny Things<option value="emarrfrm14">Bargain Basement<option value="emarrdragonsandplanes">Rants and Flames<option value="emarrfrm13">Dragons and Planes<option value="emarrroleplaying">Roleplaying<option value="emarrroleplayingoocforum">Roleplaying -
