You obviously don't want to share, so since instead of calling it me trying to work something out you call it harassing. The time I &quot;nearly screwed up&quot; your dozekar pull, I was in the room talking to you and you pulled him. You told me to leave after he was in the room. I could have opened the door and left and then Zemm would have gotten you and your buddies too, but I didn't. I helped throughout the whole fight. You're completely irrational, you just decided you want Doze and fuck everyone else who wants a shot. As to my character, I have never, ever intentionally trained anyone in my whole career in Everquest. In fact I try to go out of my way to be courteous to the people around me, occasional smartass comment excluded.  You and your guild were completely out of line, and you know it.

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> I assure you that WHATEVER happened was either accidental, or the actions of individuals. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

A guild is comprised of individuals.  The actions of the individuals reflects that of the guild and an officer was present and captured even suggesting the events that occured.  What happened was no accident.  <br>
<br>
There was only UI and DG in ToV, no one else.  Not a single person in UI is stupid enough to open the door in HoT during a battle and none of our people were near it.  Who else does that leave?<br>

Try again Grdy.  Like Khorn said, he was fine in the room.  And even so, there is no way he could aggro TWO NTOV mobs from the HoT.  Try and spin this all you want but the proof, as they say, is in the pudding.  Why would you say it in front of Khorn?  Dunno, maybe you didn't know who he was or what guild he was in, or even got him confused with zergling_rogue_02.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> However we will never condone intentionally training anyone and I'm quite sure our members are innocent of doing so.

<br>
The proof is this.  Screenshots of the 'plot' were taken.  No sooner was Dozekar engaged that we found the door opened and NTov mobs beating on us.  As I said before the only people in ToV were DG and UI.  We certainly wouldn't train ourselves and if DG didn't do it who did?  The Boogeyman?  No he was inside the HoT engaged on Doze.<br>
<br>
All I see here is DG trying to spin doctor a situation they are guilty of.  Most people know that I have no love for DG because of their indiscretions against me in the past but this just adds to pile of disgust.<br>
<br>
A guld that would crash Fear, KS an epic mob, or interfere with someone hunting, would not be above training mobs onto another guild or hell, even stealing candy from babies.<br>

If they could 'somehow' aggro on people in the HoT, there's by wipes like that constantly.  Having spent many hours in the HoT, and never having seen this happen, I'm pretty sure that N wing mobs don't aggro to HoT on their own.<br>
<br>
DG can talk about individuals all they want, but what we have here is an OFFICER of DG saying to do it, and then some other DG member actually doing it.  DG and/or Golgar can deny all they want that it wasn't an 'order' but it happened.  And no bullshit about not having control over individuals.  I'm an officer in Affliction.  I'm pretty easy-going too.  But I also expect guildmembers to do as their told, whether the order is to kill that mob, leave that other guild alone, or just shut up and focus on what we're doign and not on what everyone else is doing.  If DG really can't keep it's members from training other guilds, then they fully deserve all the scorn and disrespect that they're getting from this thread.<br>

btw Scoppie, what are you doing in that guild?<br>
You are way too nice for them. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uperceival.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Perceival</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 44<br> <font color=#E9D756>(10/30/01 10:09:28 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Dear Divine Grace,</span><hr size=1> You guys are looking pretty bad right now.  Mel isn't helping your situation at all, gilg didn't really post this thing as a flame, just a simple statement of what happened.  Then Mel starts to try and flame Gilg, and just makes himself look worse.  Really,  apologize (even if you didn't do anything wrong it never hurts) and get it over with.<br>
<br>
My suggestion to Mel, quit posting, you aren't helping your guild out at all. <p><bold><font color="yellow">Melkore</font>/<font color="lime">Perceival</font></bold>    {Da`kor-Proxie}</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ugilgamelavamar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gilgamel Avamar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 554<br> <font color=#E9D756>(10/30/01 10:10:00 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: To Gilgamel</span><hr size=1> Yes I obviously am the bad man here. I tried to talk to multiple officers to work something out. After you blatantly lied to me TWICE and ran over us after previously telling me you wouldn't I lost my temper. Strange how that happens. The fact remains I have tried my best to work with you, and you continuously rebuffed any attempts at cooperation. After this latest incident any nameds I may have called you in anger are probably more than justified.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uperceival.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Perceival</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 45<br> <font color=#E9D756>(10/30/01 10:14:43 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: To Gilgamel</span><hr size=1> can't you just feel the love in this forum... <p><bold><font color="yellow">Melkore</font>/<font color="lime">Perceival</font></bold>    {Da`kor-Proxie}</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uaanadwene.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aanadwene</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=" http://members.theglobe.com/Zackulle/10PIXEL.JPG" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 238<br> <font color=#E9D756>(10/30/01 10:15:51 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://aanadwene.homestead.com/files/TOV.jpg Height=334 Width=183></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: To Gilgamel</span><hr size=1> Gilg, someone once told me...<br>

DG take the brunt of a lot of sneering (Shardmoon's post above is pretty typical) and 'trash talk’ from such friendly folk as Gilg and Bubu. The heated words exchanged in ToV and the exchange of sarcastic comments were unfortunate but don't change my trust in them.<br>
<br>
UI players, sorry for your trouble - under the circumstances I can see why accusations both in zone and on this board might fly - but if the truth matters (and it should) you are mistaken.<br>
