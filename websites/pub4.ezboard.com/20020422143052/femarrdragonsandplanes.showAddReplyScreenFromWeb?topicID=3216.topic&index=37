<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  Yep, I was very lucky to have the help I did on Ragefire. I believe I spent more than 20% there, but who know's? Apparently Fystie and Feldynn was keeping some kind of log. I must have misunderstood though because I was under the impression that Fystie held the camp about 2 hours a night while her brother had my character up on another computer the rest of the night because he played at night anyway. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
You were more then lucky with the help you had, specially when you really didnt deserve any of it.  I doubt you spent even 20 % of the time really.  Lets analize this a bit. <br>
<br>
I started the camp the first night (after waking up at 6 in the morning)  I had the camp from about 11pm est untill 9:30 am est.  No one helped with any of those hours, as no one had been prepared to get the camp, so none of us slept during the day.  Angel takes over at 9:30 and has the camp untill about 6pm est.  You or Dein take over at that point untill 10 pm est when my husband takes over.  That's the start of our second shift.  We held the camp untill 9:30 est am again, and 80% of that second night was me alone as well.  During the 3rd,4th, and 5th nights I had the camp from Midnight est (most nights earlier so you could get some sleep) till 9:30 am.  My brother would relive me and watch it at about 3:00 est so I could get some sleep.  Anyway you add up the numbers my family watched that camp for over twice the time you did, Angel watched it almost twice the time you did.  Talk about using ppl.<br>
<br>

<br>
If you actually paid attention to others for a minute and weren't so self absorbed you would have seen her on alot more.  She was guilded with Mavrin, she's guilded now with Fite.  She plays pretty regularly.  <br>

I doubt any of us are really trying to rip your guild apart, you'll do that all on your own in due time.  I wont start the rebuilding process untill this mess is over. I dont want to burden any new members with old $hit.<br>

I'm not worried, I know who's to blame.  Though none of us are innocent, it all could have been avoided if you got a life and grew up.  Geez holding onto $hit that happened 8 months ago, damn take out your trash woman, its reaking bad.  Oh and about the truth?  I've yet to see it posted, afraid you wont look credible when I get through with you?<br>

All quotes above were from Caelie, now its time to move on to her hubby.<br>

<br>
Trilok and Fystie are friends with an individual who flamed both our guild and some guild members on a public board. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Yep its true, I was friends with an enemy of yours, but wait wasnt I friends with you too an enemy of his?  He flamed her, she flamed him (on more then one occasion mind you)  Damn I guess I should have told you both to FU CK off.  Oh wait though, he's still and will always be a friend.  You know why?  Cause he respects others, he isnt self absorbed, abnoxious, whiny, bitchy, and your all around drama queen.  <br>
<br>
So I guess since he f Ucked her over, and she f Ucked him over, but he has yet to f Uck me over, the only thing that has yet to be said is F U C K  Y O U!<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>
<br>
Is in not true that Trilok left the guild when protests started about that individual and around the same time that individual's wife cussed a member of our guild in tells while online? Our leader's response was to go hunt with him some more. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Your actually wrong with your time assumptions here.  Yes Trilok did leave the guild, but it wasnt at that time.  It was when you and Caelie were asked several times to not discuss your feelings about a friend of ours to us.  A simple request that was given to Cryptte as well, and he respected it.  I guess you couldnt handle the fact that our life doesn't revolve around you, nor the things that you were involved in 8 months ago.<br>
<br>
About the whole hunt with him some more crap.  Give me a freaking break. You make it seem like we were with him day in and day out.  We NEVER put him in front of guild events, we never turned down a guild group because we were with him, and we never spent a majority of our time with him.  He is a friend, a friend we get to see once a week in game if were lucky.  I can now see why his wife was pissed and said Fuk u.  We were forced to put you over them on many occasions, to keep the peace.  They both knew all along we were getting taking advantage of, and unlike you they kept their mouth shut to try and avoid confrontation.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Did trilok not prefer the company of this individual over his guildmates in eternal haven saying nobody was gonna tell him who to hunt with, even though we told him how we felt. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
No  Trilok didnt prefer the company of this individual over any of his guild.  He never put them in front of guild events, or guild mates.  He simply spoke his mind, and chose to remain his own person, which includes picking his own friends.  We didn't invite you to this guild, to be our mom.  We are prefectly capable of making our own friends, and our own choices.  If you want to be a father again, go adopt a noob, or someone who you CAN control.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  Did Trilok not leave eternal haven (but he must be back now) and proceed to hunt with this individual? <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Yes Trilok left EH, he felt he had no other choice.  Unless of course you think, being controlled and told when, where, why, how, and how big to $hit is a choice. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  Did Fystie not post a message that basically said she was considering disbanding EH when she got back. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Yep I sure did post a message saying I was unsure what would happen with the guild when I got home, but it would probably be no more.  What again does that have to do with anything?  It's already been established by several in your guild when you made your choice to leave and form a new guild.  It was almost a full week before that post that you started the process of forming a guild, how much before that did you talk about forming the guild?  Did you ever think the guild would be no more because of the ruins you left it in?  Maybe I wouldnt even have had a choice in keeping the guild with the $hit you pulled.<br>
<br>
[quote ]Is it not true that Trilok occasionally gets on other guilds message boards and cusses and rants like a banshee much to the embarrasment of some of his guild mates.[/quote]<br>
<br>
Hmm I remember one occasion where Trilok was on another guild message board.  He didn't rant, he didnt cuss (maybe one word), and he didnt flame.  Hell I remember you all being proud because he was the only one that had the balls to do it.  While were at it though, why dont you have your wife answer some of theese questions.  I defended her with several posts from @#%$ she started with one of her ex guilds.  She acted like a baby then, to bad I stood behind her and got involved.<br>
<br>

Practice what you preach there buddy.  I haven't lied, I haven't mislead anyone.  I simply spoke up because I didn't agree with what you were doing.  I thought I exposed you all pretty well on our guild boards.  Damn as I remember it I even  proved your lies with your own f Ucking posts!<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  You wanna talk about back stabbing picture this... your guild leaders are hunting with a guy who flamed you and the very guild they lead.

<br>
I'm still waiting for the back stabbing on our part.  I was friends with someone you didnt like, someone your wife attacked or instigated on many occasions.  I thought the true treachery has been exposed, you mean to tell me there's more lies yet to come?  Damn you guys have been busy.<br>

<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  I just want you guys and gals to know how honored I was to see every active officer camped in Skyfire for the past 5 or 6 days. Everyone of you spent the time you were online there and I think that right there showed the guild alot when it comes to leadership. You would get out of groups to make room for guild members that needed exp, you would get in the groups that were short. It was awesome to see us come together like we did. Every officer showed leadership at one time or another during that camp and I am so proud of you and us as a guild. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
That was from Caelie just a few short weeks before this all transpired.  How again did the future look dim?  Or is Caelie just blowing smoke up our asses here like she has done many times before?  I'd be willing to bet its smoke, since we know your discussions about forming the guild started in early March.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  It was formed with the intention of being a safety net so that the members who wanted to hunt together could continue along with a minimum of disruption if you did disband the guild. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

There was no talk of the guild being disbanded when you took steps and formed EP.  In fact let me quote some more from your wife quick.<br>

We never made excuses for anything either of you all did.  I think you were both wrong, and I have said it many times.  I simply requested to stay out of it, because I considered you both friends. You ignored my request, you pushed me in the middle, and you even freaking attacked me.  Gee sounds like it was really ignored to me.<br>

Most ppl didn't even know what was going on, so how could they feel the same as you?  I ran them off?  OMG you crack me up.  That's why we've been aproached by 3 of your members, members you told certain things to, to get them to join.  Funny how they no longer wear your guild tag aint it?<br>

Why dont you finish reading before you hit the reply you fool.  It was me who posted it, and I didnt pull things out my ass.  I simply said what ppl from YOUR guild told me, though I did misunderstand what Danix said to me.  He said 3 of YOUR accounts, I took that to mean Dein, Caelie, and Azuwere.<br>

I wish you only spoke the facts with all your other bull $hit posts.  It would be much easier on me, when quoting you.  /clap  I'm proud in all your replies, you finally got one thing right.<br>

<br>
So let me get this straight?  She was aware of the discussion, that began a week before the guild was formed, she was aware of the process to form the guild which began before we went to Vegas, and yet her comments about the guild forming was because of a post I made almost a week later?  /gasp You mean she lied? How convienent.<br>

<br>
I doubt we could do any more damage then was done while we were away on vacation.  You are wrong when you say I am hurting my credibility though, because I have yet to be caught in the middle of a lie.  Only a misunderstanding when I mentioned Caelie was present.  It is your credibility that's going down hill fast.  I'm not trying to hurt your members, just telling a story of betrayal, deceit and lies.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>   So how long do we go on with this embarassing spectacular in public? <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Honestly I can say I'm not embarrased in the slightest.  Guess that's because in the end I didn't say what made me look good.  I said what was on my mind no matter how incriminating it may be.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> You obviously think the issues with the ex guildy was a minor thing, and you missed the boat much like the people you are defending... not everyone saw it as minor....

<br>
We never pretended it was minor.  We simply got over it a month after it happened.  So lets see at least 7 months ago.  I can say none of this would have happened if you didn't continually bring it up.  You had a grudge from months ago, why make it a problem again by picking fights?<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  keep fussin about when the guild was created, and how you never had a chance to discuss it and all that.. Keep talkin about caelie and what a rotten person she is.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Sick to know I still dont think she is a rotten person.  I dislike her, I think she enjoys trying to control ppl, and is one of the its my way or the highway kinda people.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> My advice is to look and see what is the real reason people left EH. Learn from it and dont make those same mistakes again... or... just keep typing away on the Emarr board..<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I've looked at the real reasons from every angle.  You know what I saw?  A pile of $hit in your corner.  $hit that should have been taken out many months ago.  I wont make the same mistakes again, I cant.  Your not here any more.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  Now go back and read my post again. Leave off all the sidebars and excuses and answer those questions. Then you will know everything you need to know about why we left.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Went back and read it, answered all the questions, and came to this conclusion.  You couldnt control the other officers, you couldn't gossip like old woman about ex members, you couldn't handle that in my group of friends was someone you despised.  Does it make you sick that were continuing on without you?  I'll get over this when the thread hits page 2.  You can't get over it, because it's gonna happen again and again, untill you grow up and learn what friendship, loyalty, trust, and honor is.<br>
<br>
Ok thats it with him for now... Back to Caelie's latest post..<br>
<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  Fact: Don't act like we didn't give you guys a chance to discuss the things that were bothering us. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
You did give us a chance, we did discuss it, we moved on. Untill the next bitch fest from you that is.  The point Caelie is something is always bothering you.  Your a miserable person, and its drives you crazy that we wouldnt be miserable with you.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Fystie said there were how many post in the Officers forum where we felt uncomfortable about you guys hunting with someone that had flamed guildmembers in a guild they were leading? How many months or weeks did we try to discuss this? <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
There were several threads, most started from you.  Several threats, some from you.  If I tell you tomorrow you cant talk to Danix cause I dont like him, what will your responce be?  Oh wait, I think I've got it already from you, let me dig it up quick...<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>
Since when did Guildtag designate who you can hunt with. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Your words.  I know its hard to believe but I have many friends, alot of whom aren't in the same guild as me.  Do your words apply to only you?  Is this a double standard or what?  Or maybe because I was one of the leaders, I'm bound by different rules.  Let's do a little analogy here quick.<br>
<br>
Guild X has 50 members, of the 50 members there is about 5 enemies each.  That's 250 ppl the leader isn't allowed to group with?  So would this be a proper responce to one of the enemies...<br>
<br>
/tell enemy_192  Look I know we've been friends since we were both noobs here, but your on so and so's $hit list so I have to break off the friendship, or be accused of being unloyal.  <br>
<br>
Sounds real fair huh...<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Fact: Feldynn, your reply was always that it was no big deal and 3 other Officers response was to leave the guild to show us that they didn't want to be bothered with our concerns. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I answered that in an earlier post, but let me refresh your memory.  3 officers were tired of the bickering, 3 officers were tired of being forced to choose, 3 officers were tired of your grudge affecting an entire guild.  I dont see those 3 officers being given any other choice, aside from kiss your @ss. <br>

Foof<br>
