<br>
I'm not judging you on it. I've gotten pissed at people when I played too. And hindsight is 20/20. You guys did some things that in retrospect you know weren't ideal.<br>
<br>
The problem is, both sides are having a problem with the other and it escalates. <br>
<br>
It's like a neighbor calling the cops saying hey they torched my car. And then you find out it started with someone getting mad over something, then one egged the house, then the other salted the lawn, then one guy beats up the other guy, then they poison their dog, then they torch the car.<br>
<br>
I mean obviously that's a bit dramatic and all <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  But that's the reason it was moved. Both groups were having a pissing match and both sides escalated it. <br>
<br>
I had someone e-mail me saying they also had a bad experience with Soulcollector. Which leads me to believe this guy is probably a bad egg. Unless they or someone else wants to post about it though, based on just this one thing it's not shitlistable, for the sole reason that both parties in this situation were wrong based solely on your account. (Which personally I think it probably one of the more honest accounts I've seen posted on the shitlist.)<br>
<br>
I would move it if he shitlisted you guys for the same reason. Which he could if the <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> only</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> thing that had happened was you guy blocked him in the room. And if that was the only thing that happened then if he shitlisted you guys it would remain up. But obviously alot more happened.<br>
<br>
Moving it was something I put some thought into, and I don't expect everyone to agree with it. But that was why it was moved. And if other people post bad experiences with this guy, then it will be moved back.<br>
<br>
Otherwise, at this time it's more appropriate for rants. <p><a href="http://www.anarchyboard.com" target="_blank">

I also think bullying people  with your higher level characters is silly and a bit immature (but how can i call anyone immature when i giggle uncontrolably at ure funny name lmao lmao)<br>

regardless of what actually happened... this is a prime example why VI should include the &quot;/eatgnome Target&quot; ability for large races! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

P.S. just info for myself: i was pretty sure that more mobs HAD been included to HHK around the time the GB sword quest came about, goblin thieves, goblins and crazed goblins. have the two extra spawns in the LO room been removed? and does this mean that the GB sword quest is gone? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uthedruiddirtt.showPublicProfile?language=EN>TheDruidDirtt</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>n00b!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(1/11/02 12:31:53 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=737.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Soulcollector aka Domestic</span><hr size=1> I guess I will reply on the boards giving my side since everyone is going with poops story.  All I can say really is people need to lighten up, i mean, its a game for christ sakes, play it and have fun, you lose 1 mob who cares, another will pop soon.  All of this tension is going to cause a heart attack ;\.  I didn't steal any mobs from the guard room that night, nor did I train anyone, or KS anyone.  <br>
<br>
My RL friend Soulcollector was spending the night at my house because we had to do some community service for a class at school.  It was a couple nights ago, we decided at school we were going to come to my house after we were done with the community service and work on my monk.  We came to my house and logged on.  We went into HK and started soloing the lookout room, osargen, and the bard, it was good exp for a level 25 monk.  Soon after we get started on that some people keep coming into lookout room looking around for things to pull, I am assuming that is what they are doing because the came in, looked around and left about 10 times.<br>
<br>
I am thinking to myself, this is going to be a long night.  After a bit loggroller comes in, without run on, I say to Soulcollector rofl look at that, no run on.   We have a laugh about that until he pulls a spawn that popped, he ran(walked) out to his group and they proceeded to kill it.  (Soulcollector was playing at this time, i was laying on my bed watching) He says Don't do that again loggroller, and tells the group what he did.  Loggroller sends us a tell saying do what, trying to act like he doesn't know what he was doing.  Soulcollector is the type of person who thinks, an eye for an eye, so he pulls a lookout from there spawn, and kills it.  After that, the crap started.  They started doing some low things, i.e blocking us in the room with 2 people and saying they were not moving for anything, and when soulcollector(playing on domestic) told them to move, he was coutning down from 5, and they were being smartasses and counting down with him.<br>
<br>
He proceeds to countdown from 5 and when he reaches 1, they were still standing there laughing in his face basically.  He tells me thats it, I am sick of this BS and he types /q and logs on his account and gets on his necromancer and heads to highkeep.   He gets there and makes a pet.  starts to kill anything he sees pop.  They start going on about petitioning and such, doesn't bother him at all, then the guy poopuu or something comes around trying to make a deal, saying we will stay out of lookout room if you stop ks'ing and ill tell the gm that is was fixed when he gets here, we agree to that and have made 1 friend out of there group already. (ironic isn't it)<br>
<br>
We log back on domestic and start leveling again, we are taking mad harassment in ooc, we ignore it and keep leveling.<br>
<br>
I don't remember everyones name involved, nor do I care, just realize you were just as wrong as we were for what you did, this shouldn't have been posted here really.  But nonetheless it has been.<br>
<br>
Tonight I petitioned the name poopuu, its a disturbing name, one a 10 year old would use.  They got on me tonight in ooc in HK again when the GM came and made him change it, now he is Daisypicker or something along those lines.  Flons, Bupas and a few others were harassing me tonight, Gallana Lady or something like that, a high level wizard was anon, comes into lookout room and ks's me, a GM see's it, does nothing and just says share spawns and leaves.  Bunch of crap I think, she was over level 49 because she used ice comet on one of the lookouts to finish it, she also said to me while the gm was there, I am here for faction now back off, when I was clearly camping the room.<br>
<br>
So I left the zone, couldn't take anymore harassment in occ, almost everyone in that zone was talking trash in ooc.  Like for no reason, this 20 ranger named Marcilus or something says in ooc, Domestic your nothing without that fungi, I reply want to duel and I will use no tunic, he says I don't want to waste my time.  I reply you mean get wasted, they go on saying now I talk all the trash.  These are things that make the game not fun, at all.  I hope people recognize the things some people try to do to others, most of it is totally lame.<br>

There is only 3 spawns in the lookout room, not two, not four, but three.  Ghosteel I am sorry you feel that way, maybe you should keep your negetive comments here on the boards and out of the game, because when you blurt those kind of things in ooc like you were last night, along with about 15 others, it makes you look like a total loser.<br>
<br>
I will be posting my log of the 10th soon, editing out all the fighting and mob talk.  It is quite hilarious and shows how I get treated in ooc by these people posting saying I am ksing and am a bad person, man do they get hostile in ooc.  Poop seems to say nice things and take a SS well, you can see what he/she says in ooc, it's not very nice at all.  I am also so glad the name was changed to daisypicker.<br>
