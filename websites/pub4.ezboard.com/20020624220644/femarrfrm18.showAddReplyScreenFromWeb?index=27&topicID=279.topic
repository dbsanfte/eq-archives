President Kim Jong II. This stuff about saving the peasants is kinda a load of crap don't you think? The U.S. has shown no interest in South American dictators or African militants unless there is an interest at stake. In fact we have overthrown democratically elected leaders in South America and instituted facist military regimes that promised to better protect our capitalist interests. <br>
<br>
We always used to use those words, (petty, cruel, despotic, probably insane, pathetic excuses for leader) to describe Castro. Is he less a threat now? Castro would almost look like a saint when you stand him next to the guy the U.S. tried to empower there. Fact is people like Escobar, Somoza, Lumumba, Sukarno, Arbenz, Mossadegh, Sihanouk were good leaders with flaws, like all humans, that the U.S. overexaggerated to use as excuses to oust them and put in leaders who would support our strip mining of thier countries in exchange for weapons. I have nothing wrong with pointing out the short comings of leaders, in fact I think it is a citizens duty to keep the world leaders on their toes, but when any criticism that even remotely equals the @#%$ we've slung about Castro or the Arabs is said about our leaders out come the &quot;love it or leave it crowd&quot; to @#%$ all over Jefferson's ideals of how a nation should be run. <br>
<br>
Remember America's original motto? You know the flag with the snake.  &quot;Don't tread on me.&quot; That is the way America should and can be run. We should not be a pre-emptive attacker. They want a war, bring it to us and we will level them. No nation on this planet posesses the ability to wipe us off the planet, despite what many doom-prophets may cry,  save oursleves. China or Russia may but their leaders have the common sense the third world leaders do not and will not initiate a war for fear of global retribution. Perhaps we will realize the world doesn't much like our war-mongering either before the world decides to act. I don't think the collective nations of this planet give a @#%$ about U.S. popular opinion at election time when they see the havoc some of our haphazard foriegn policy has wrought. <br>

While the Cold war was nasty business that, at times had to be done, we are building an ugly history for the world to see.  We need to build a positive image the world can reflect on and not that of a two-faced economic power.  Its some sad bullshit.  Its sad that the media doesn't report other opinions on what is going on.  But it is getting to be a smaller world.  <br>
 <br>
  Pretty soon, we will learn to work for justice world-wide and not just declare war only to create a moral reason for such an act.  I can understand some reaosn behind what we do.  Basically, if there is no possibility of an economic payoff, we don't get involved.  When we do get involved, we destroy our economy to a certain degree.  If we did that once for all of the worlds problems, we would destroy ourselves.  So who the heck knows.  We do some good things and do some bad.  Problem is that the world only sees the bad sh!t. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/urittdabard.showPublicProfile?language=EN>rittdabard</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 67<br> <font color=#E9D756>(3/23/02 3:06:38 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=279.topic&index=29>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Politics of war</span><hr size=1> Yes Brutas you make many valid points. I want to point something else out. OK get ready...Hitler was a genius. Did anyone reading that have an angry knee-jerk reaction. I know when I have said that before I have been nearly killed. Do not get me wrong I don't agree with much of Hitler's idealology, but he was an incredibly effective and progressive leader. Hitler pumped a lot of money into science and technology. That stuff is not told to us though. We are only told about the evils of his reign. <br>
<br>
I see America gradually becoming the Germany that impowered Hitler. We are becoming more and more nationalistic, and showing less respect for other nations. We are becoming more willing to set aside ethics in order to promote our own industry. We have shown no hesitation in protecting American businesses' interests overseas. We seem to take less and less personal responsibility for our own shortcomings. These are the traits that lead to Germany's fanatical devotion to Hitler. Adolph Hitler didn't create those traits in his people, he harnassed those characteristics to get the full support of the German people. I am very afraid that this is the only side of America that other countries are seeing. <br>

There are similarities that can be drawn.  About American business, I find is disappointing that we don't know the impacts it is having.  Alot of it has to do with cultural diffussion that naturally takes place in a capitalist society.  It causes much heartache for all countries who travel through the transition.  Much of this is why Bin Laden can find supporters so easily.  IMO we force it too much on other countries, whereas we should use an implosive strategy rather than an explosive one.  Through the transition the Middle Eastern countries face, political systems would collapse or come close to it if we weren't so economically aggressive.  Being this way allows them to direct their frustrations against us in a nationalistic manner.  Just as 9/11 did for us.  <br>
<br>
Hitler was a genius,  though I believe everyone is a genius in their own right, Hitler used passionate speech to rally a hurting people who were no more guilty of anything wrong than England, France or Russia.  Germany definetly got the shaft in WW I.  Supossedly, much of America's involvement was due to Zionist politicians who brought us in WW I to help England who in turn made a deal with the Zionist Jews to carve out a Jewish territory(Israel).  In fact as far as I know, there were just as many Americans searching to help Germany in WW I as there were England.  Or almost as many.  <br>
<br>
I don't see us becoming as nationalistic as Hitlers Germany because we have a two party system that will always find fault with each other.  But I think your point is interesting because of the correlation of our policies having so much to do with Israel. The more and more that happens, the more I see our government becoming corrupt.  Our politicians are sellouts to whoever can offer them the most money.  There is some genuine  policy making but the majority of it is geared to appease not the voters, but the people who contribute monetarily. Today's society scoffs at the idea of conspiricy because the media has gradually exposed the 'nutballs' who attempt as shedding light on some of these inportant issues.  In todays world, you have to have a picture, video tape or recording of something to prove it orelse you are deemed as 'weak-minded' or downright crazy.  <br>
<br>
Why isn't anyone asking Why did our security agenices have notice of suspicious trvallers and do nothing about it?  Why did the large majority of Jewish workers at the trade center get a phone call not to go to work that same morning?  How did Israeli security agencies know as much or more than our security agencies?  Why didn't non-Jewish workers get a phone call?  Why is this not a topic for the media to cover?  They would increses sale 3 fold I'm sure.<br>
<br>
While I don't agree on may things about your comparison with Hitler's goverment, there is one thing I do agree on and thats the corruption level of ours. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <br><font color=#E9D756>- </font><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/bemarr>Erollisi Marr, The Queen of Love</a><font color=#E9D756> - </font><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18>America Under Attack</a> <font color=#E9D756> - </font> <br>
