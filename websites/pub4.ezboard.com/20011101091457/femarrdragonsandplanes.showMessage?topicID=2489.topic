I was having a good day in EQ. I was running around with friends killing things and chatting my 'lil heart out etc, etc. I showed up in South Ro to lead a raid I was leading where I help people out with their epics.<br>
<br>
After I got to SRO, and worked to get everyone that was required there, we went off and kill The Tandrid in FoB for our friendly neighboorhood enchanter Simm. I had fun and we soundly wumped the big monkey. <br>
<br>
After this was over, a lot of people had to go which was unfortunate. I had wanted to do a few more mobs! So, when all was said and done we had 1 solid group and 1 group that wasn't so solid. We decided to head to Mistmoore for an easy kill of the shaman epic guy there. We arrived and that was when we realized we had to camp the advisor prior to spawning the epic dude. <br>
<br>
So, here we were camping this guy, and after his 2nd PH pop I asked the group if during the 30minutes before the next spawn if they wanted to head over to Everfrost to kill Miragul for me. They agreed.<br>
<br>
For those of you that don't know, the paladin epic (fiery defender) requires a fiery avenger as its by far hardest component. I had almost everything except the FA. The FA itself requires a soulfire ( I have), a ghoulbane (also have), and the head and robe of miragul. To attain the head and robe of miragul you must kill nagafen and vox or there kunark counterparts for the burnt book and frost book. I killed vox at level 52 for the final time and attained the frost book. I then had the fire book chained with me for an ungodly amount of money at the time. When the books are combined you recieve a book of scale. You turn this in to the oracle in OOT to recieve Miraguls Philactercy.<br>
<br>
So, this is where I was for 5 months or so. I was to lazy to kill Miragul I guess, and it was only recently I had everything else for my epic anyway. So, I took my 2 groups down to everfrost to kill Miragul. We buffed up and prepared to assault his pansy ass!<br>
<br>
We ran over to where he was, and the enchanter in my group charmed him. With an indiffernt con I walked up to him to hand in my Miragul's Philactercy. I put the item in the trade window. I conned him again, and when it said indiff, I immediately hit trade.<br>
<br>
He gave me the &quot;I cannot accept this from the likes of you&quot; and started wacking on me. The enchanter recharmed but it was to late. My books were eaten.<br>
<br>
I petitioned a GM, he could not help. I talked to a lead GM, he could not help, I emailed Verant, this is what they said.<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
Whether it was an item worth 100 copper or 110,000 platinum ultimately makes<br>
no difference. Regardless of whether it took you 2 minutes or 200+ hours of<br>
gameplay, it was ultimately just a quest where the charm broke and the item<br>
you turned in was lost. It can happen, and it can happen to anyone on any<br>
quest where charming is required. We do not differentiate between the two<br>
types of issues, because they end up to be the same problem.<br>
<br>
As for the other person that was reimbursed, I will not speak on that, as I<br>
was not the one to do it, and will not speak on prior incidents or their<br>
outcomes. The reason for this is simply because each case is different, and<br>
may have different circumstances or policies associated with it. I can only<br>
speak on this issue here and now, and I can only say that in this case,<br>
because the charm broke on the NPC, and because that is a normal gameplay<br>
feature -- a risk -- the item cannot be reimbursed.<br>

<br>
Well, I can understand how a raid might not go exactly as planned for a<br>
guild or how a mob might not react as it is supposed to. However, isn't it<br>
kind of harsh to just have someone lose 200+ hours of game time and an item<br>
that goes for 110,000platinum, just because they are on a 56k modem and not<br>
into the broadband world?<br>
<br>
Well, another thing is, is that another paladin on our server who was one of<br>
the first to get his Fiery avenger and one of the first to 60, had this<br>
exact same thing happen. He was reimbursed. There was lag that day and it<br>
accounted for the accident. I don't remember his exact name, but I could<br>
aquire it.<br>

&gt; Hello Kenny,<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Unfortunately when doing quests, there are often incidents or problematic<br>
&gt; issues that arise that hinder the successful nature of the quest. Certain<br>
&gt; issues, such as packet loss and other connectivity issues can play a role<br>
in<br>
&gt; a quest, and whether it succeeds or fails. It appears that in this case,<br>
&gt; that the lag you were experiencing was a result of your connection or a<br>
&gt; connection problem in your area.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; I'm afraid that in a case such as this, because the fact that the NPC was<br>
&gt; charmed and lost it's charm, and because of the fact that such a thing can<br>
&gt; occur under the scope of normal gameplay, that we cannot reimburse the<br>
book<br>
&gt; turned in, or issue the reward of completing this part of the quest. It is<br>
&gt; unfortunate that such a thing occurred, but please understand that not<br>
every<br>
&gt; raid is going to succeed every time, and that not every mob will respond<br>
&gt; and/or react as you might expect it to.<br>
&gt;<br>

&gt; --Original Message Follows--<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; Well, last night I was working on my epic quest as I have been trying<br>
too<br>
&gt; &gt; constantly for the last 8 or so months. I play a paladin mainly, and as<br>
&gt; such<br>
&gt; &gt; I was required to kill both nagafen and vox many many times before I<br>
&gt; &gt; recieved my 2 paladin epic books.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; A couple months ago or so I had them both and had them combined into a<br>
&gt; book<br>
&gt; &gt; of scale. I then went to OOT to turn them into Miragul's philactercy.<br>
All<br>
&gt; &gt; this went smoothly and the last couple months I have been leveling and<br>
&gt; &gt; working on my fiery defender quest.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; However, last night I went to everfrost to take down miragul finally. I<br>
&gt; had<br>
&gt; &gt; 2 full solid groups with me and a couple enchanters.  The level 55<br>
&gt; enchanter<br>
&gt; &gt; in my group charmed the lich of miragul so his faction would be<br>
&gt; indifferent<br>
&gt; &gt; with me. I conned him and miraguls philactercy in trade window. I conned<br>
&gt; him<br>
&gt; &gt; again and he was still charmed and indifferent and I right away hit<br>
trade.<br>
&gt; &gt; He gave me the message &quot;I will not accept this from the likes of you&quot;<br>
and<br>
&gt; &gt; was scowls ready to attack. The enchanter said he had just broken charm<br>
at<br>
&gt; &gt; that exact instant, even though I had conned him less than half a second<br>
&gt; &gt; before. I petitioned and the GMs said they couldn't help and that charm<br>
&gt; &gt; breaking was just a part of questing.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; Please help. We were all experiencing around 12-20% PL so this was<br>
&gt; partially<br>
&gt; &gt; a server side error maybe.  This should have worked and, well, to put it<br>
&gt; &gt; frankly, I'm not sure about continuing my EQ career after a loss of my<br>
&gt; &gt; entire epic. Especially since I am now almost level 56 with no books and<br>
&gt; no<br>
&gt; &gt; guild.  That makes it nearly impossible for me to ever attain my epic.<br>
&gt; &gt; Again, please help.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
I am not a swearer. But really, I have to utter a resounding &quot;FUCK&quot;. <br>
<br>
I think this is the end of my EQ career. Bye all.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/bemarr.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=argris>Argris</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 46<br> <font color=#E9D756>(10/2/01 8:32:51 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Don't you all just love epics?</span><hr size=1> ACK, I fugged.

<br>
He has helped guildies on quests that goofed up and it was a fault in the quest. Theres a difference between the quest messing up and charm breaking at a bad time though. While I agree, I highly doubt the quest designer intended this to be a part of the risk involved, you have to remember, GM's get PAID to be GM's. If you thought you might lose your RL job because someone lost some pixels in a game, would you break the rules to give them their item back, or stick to the rules and keep your cushy job playing a computer game? :P<br>
<br>
I would do as others have suggested and push this on up to the next level. This is the kind of thing that is clearly wrong, but only a very few people have the authority to make that determination. <br>
<br>
Anyways, good luck in getting your epic stuff back, I know what a giant pain in the ass the paladin epic is. <p>Raiid Daedsgubllik (60)<BR>

dispite the fact that they want to impliment it so that if you dont hand in all the items / correct ones, NPC's hand them back to you....<br>
<br>
Can anyone say &quot;hybrid xp penalty&quot;<br>
<br>
Verant says, &quot;We will never do this!&quot;<br>

A few months pass......<br>

Actually, transfering that No Drop item for you guys was directly against the policy on the Everquest homepage. It states that no drop items should not be moved for any reason whatsoever. Not saying that was the wrong thing to do, or anything. Just don't say he doesn't break the rules =D <p> <IMG SRC=http://nirecnad.bizland.com/nire.gif></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/usagemonprayeth.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sagemon Prayeth</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 132<br> <font color=#E9D756>(10/3/01 7:06:45 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Don't you all just love epics?</span><hr size=1> Verant has proposed changing the system so that a quest NPC will return items if the items are not correct.  The problem with that is that it would eliminate multiquesting (or chain questing, as some people call it).  If a quest requires two components, and I give the NPC only one of them, the NPC would hand it back to me.<br>
<br>
Anyway, didn't Gorndax have a problem like this?  It seems like he went LD while making an exchange or something like that.  I recall that he had to fight for a while, but that finally someone helped him. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/umaldaria.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Maldaria</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 76<br> <font color=#E9D756>(10/3/01 7:09:46 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> .</span><hr size=1> VI customer service is like the flu.

You admit that you did not hand in the items properly (mob must be charmed, but charm broke a split second prior) but given the lag between your computer and VI's, you had no way of knowing. This is a poorly designed quest if 2 dragon drops can be destroyed due solely to the connection lag that is unavoidable in internet gaming.<br>
<br>
Sagemon is right - VI proposed making NPCs reject items that they are not able to accept as part of a quest, but most people I know (myself included) were far more worried about the side effect - Verant is going to Nerf chainquesting! Patch tomorrow, I bet that's what they are doing! etc., etc.<br>
<br>
But now I see the other side, as I was recently screwed by NPCs eating improper items myself. But in my case it was 100% my fault - my wife was nagging me to log off and help her, 2 nephews running around, people talking to me in game, and I tried to finish the bulk of my epic quest (red scabbard), and handed the 2 final NO DROP items of this quest in... to the wrong NPC!!! I shit a brick, petitioned, emailed Jason Miller, and got a nice long response telling me how much fun it will be for my guild to do this quest again for me. The real crappy part is that I can't blame VI or some jerk player, just my own Stupid self. Ironically I know people who blew this quest by not having an open main inv slot to hold the Red Scabbard (hehe, I did have an open slot) so after getting the Scabbard it immediately poofed, but since they actually got the item and had no way of knowing that they needed an open slot (unless they hear from somebody who did the quest before) it was not their fault and they were re-embursed.<br>
<br>

<br>
I'm sorry, but its GM's like him that make people say bad things about Verant CS. If you continually have to escalate to get ANYTHING done, then you get annoyed and frustrated. You start wondering why you even talk to these guys instead of just talking to/emailing the head guy. You basically start doing the equivalent of what we in the tech support business deal with, you call in and the first words out of your mouth are &quot;I want to talk to your manager/supervisor/the head of the company...&quot;.  <p><small><br><br><br><br>Celdor Dreamweaver - Bard - Ret.
