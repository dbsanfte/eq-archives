<br>
I actually didn't have a personal issue with them raising prices.  Consider that their pricing scheme has been the same since release.  Consider also that there are increased operating costs and heck, even inflation, and they were making far less two months ago from the same customer than they were at the time of release.  In hindsight, a price-hike is pretty damn well inevitable, even to just maintain the status quo.  I don't like having to pay more, but I can understand where they are coming from in raising the prices.<br>
<br>
And while I don't particularly like the increased specs, its something that the needed to do.  Look at pre-SoL graphics compared with the other games out there.  Eye-candy isn't a substantive measure of a game's merits by any means, but you aren't going to attract more folks to play your game, and you won't keep graphics oriented players, if you are using State-Of-The-Art 1998 graphics on a 2002 game.  I would have appreciated having an &quot;Old World&quot; version of the graphics so that those without the specs could perhaps run the zones, but even ignoring the coding nightmare that would be, if the price-hike bothers you as is, consider what it would be if they had spent the resources to implement something like that.<br>
<br>
A lot of the blame that is placed on VI is due to the fact that they were the first to really hit it big in this genre (UO was nice, but it never took off like EQ has).  Everyone after them has had a chance to adapt, to learn from their mistakes, and to code things &quot;right&quot; the first time around, rather than having to deal with repatching existing code and create things from whole cloth.  There's simply no way they could remain competitive without causing at least some degree of inconvienience to their customer base.  Whether or not they have minimized that degree of inconvienience is another thing altogether, and very open to debate, but the fact remains that the old adage about Cake and broken eggs applies.<br>
<br>
As far as system specs for POP... they may not have said whether or not it will bump them, but they have said that it will be using the SoL engine.  Knowing that, I think its pretty safe to rule out another SoL-comparable boost in minimum operating requirements.  It could well be higher than SoLs, but probably not by a large amount, relatively.<br>
<br>
There's a lot of legitimate reasons to be ticked off with VI or Sony about EQ.  Implementing things like the Legends servers rather than increasing overall guide/GM availability, some seemingly idiotic nerf and &quot;rebalancing&quot; decisions, draconian limits on what volunteer guides can do to assist a person, and sloppily implemented (or still non-implemented) zones and features.  Vex Thal, a working Bazaar, visible cloaks, and that &quot;new&quot; GUI they had mentioned all come to mind in specific.  I just don't think being upset about the pricing increase makes a lot of sense.  Suffice to say that I doubt they'd do it if it was unprofitable, and if its profitable, its not offending enough people gravely enough for them to kick their addictions. <p><center>Malevant Faeshadow<br>Speedbump<br> <br> Officer of the Free Company<br><IMG SRC="http://www.unicorntrad.org/three.jpg"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/usagemonprayeth.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sagemon Prayeth</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 453<br> <font color=#E9D756>(4/19/02 1:28:14 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3293.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: RANT-EQ: Plane of Power Expansion</span><hr size=1> First of all, let me state the obvious: Sony is in business to make money.  They aren't doing this as a hobby.  They're entitled to charge what the market will bear.  If you want to bitch about prices, ask yourself how much a pair of Nikes costs to make.<br>
<br>
Second, a rational business does not respond to reduced sales by raising its prices.  Make fun of Sony all you want, but we're talking about a very well run company.<br>
<br>
Third, if there has really been such a huge reduction in the subscriber base, why aren't there a bunch of deserted zones?  The zones that are empty today are the same ones that were empty a year ago.<br>
<br>
I'm sure that the subscriber base is down from its peak.  A lot of people have moved on to other games or to real life.  There are new people playing EQ all the time, but the outflow of players has probably been greater than the inflow.  Only Sony would know for sure.  From what I can see, though, EQ looks pretty healthy.<br>
<br>
Even with the increased price, EQ is still pretty cheap entertainment.  If you go to a movie and buy some popcorn and a Coke, you're probably spending as much as you spend on EQ for a month.  You can go to a single NBA game and easily spend more than you spend on EQ for an entire year.<br>
<br>
Of course, that speaks volumes about why attendance is down in the NBA. <p>Sagemon Prayeth<BR>

<br>
First, I wanted to say that the replies thus far are intelligent and well-thought out.  Thanks...  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I guess what I am really trying to get at is that, we're being charged more per month and their reasons are because of added services.  What added services?  I mean, the EQ Premium service is a huge flop...  Who is really going to pay $40 a month for an extended period of time?  Also, one other point that I wanted to make is that SONY just release Shadows of Luclin and now, all of sudden, low and behold!!! Here's another expansion!!!  I'm just trying to say that, if we are going to get charged more per month and the customer base JUST paid for a new expansion, then, don't you think Plane of Power should be included?  I kind of feel &quot;gipped&quot; from the whole experience, I don't know about you...<br>
<br>
~ Triz<br>
<br>
P.S.  Here's some bonus information for you guys:<br>
<br>
* SONY acquired VI about a year and a half ago and then pushed three new expansions afterwards, Kunark, Velios and Luclin.  I don't know about you, but customer service with these people is less than acceptable.<br>
* SONY was sued in the year 2000 for UNFAIR business practices and pricing schemes.<br>
* SONY is being sued again for this same business practice.<br>
* Price increase for EverQuest MATCHES the montly price for those that are signing up to play Star Wars this summer.  From my own perspective, it look likes SONY is raising the EQ rate so they can retain their market and keep customers on a &quot;lateral&quot; level between SW and EQ instead of offering them choices.<br>
* Again, SONY contributes the increase in price due to new SERVICES.  I have no problem with paying more but what new services?!?!?  And just for that, Plane of Power should be a GIVEN FREEBIE...  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ufisarik.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Fisarik</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 239<br> <font color=#E9D756>(4/19/02 2:28:37 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3293.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: RANT-EQ: Plane of Power Expansion</span><hr size=1> If you don't like it, don't play. How hard is that to figure out? You don't like Sony or their business practices? For christ's sake, cancel your account. PLAYING EVERQUEST IS NOT MANDATORY. YOU WILL NOT DIE IF YOU QUIT. THERE IS LIFE BESIDES THIS GAME. One of the main things that made me quit is people like you who can't stop complaining yet KEEP PLAYING AT ANY COST.<br>
<br>
Oh, and do you have ANY clue how much the amount of bandwidth EverQuest uses costs? Even remotely? And maybe you've noticed (well, obviously not) that prices inflate over time? The price raise is to cover the bandwidth pricing changes over the last few years.<br>
<br>
Let me use your own numbers here for a minute. 420,000 paying customers. Lets take an average time when there are, say, 200,000 people connected and playing (during peak times, maybe). On average, each of these accounts will be both sending/recieving data at approximately 5kb/sec.<br>
200,000 * 5kb/sec = 1,000,000kb/sec<br>
= 976gb/sec<br>
= Almost a terabyte a second. A @#%$ <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> terabyte</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->. Thats quite a lot of motherfucking data. Do you think its free to have 1400 computers transferring terabytes upon terabytes of data at any given time? Er. No. A game like this is VERY expensive to run and the pricing is reasonable. Prices will soon be $13.95 or something a month, correct? How much is a movie where you live? It's about $6.50 here. Now, seeing as the average movie is about 2 hours long, for the same price as a month of EverQuest, I can get 4 hours of entertainment at a movie theater. Considering most people play 30 to 100+ hours of EQ a month, thats a pretty good @#%$ deal.<br>
<br>
Honestly, what do you expect? It to be free? For them to pay you to play? This is a business and they are in it to make money, not to make friends. In all seriousness, if you don't like it, you may get all of your friend's email addresses, sell your account, and keep in touch with them that way for free. Really. If you don't like the game, quit. They release expansions as they see fit, and if you do not agree with this, I welcome you to start your own software company to spite them.<br>
<br>

If you feel that strongly about hating Verant then the only way to make your point is quit the game. I don't have a problem with Verant because they have made what I consider to be one of the greatest games of all time, sure they fvck up sometimes but I am prepared to overlook that because I think the good outweighs the bad.<br>

1) They had customer service that wasn't a nightmare.  My God.. they bring in millions a month and dont even have a damn 1-800 number.<br>
<br>
2)  We were getting more out of their price increase.  How many things have been broken FOREVER and have never been touched?  Why all the new content (much of it broken) without fixing the existing problems.  <br>
<br>
They say that there are different teams for developement and troubleshooting.  This arguement doesn't hold water for a few reasons.  If the developers didn't do such a half-assed job which Sony/VI released well before it as ready, then the troubleshooting team wouldn't have so much on their plates now would they?  Also, you dont start off writing code.  Any programmer can tell you that most of your time is spent going through other people's code.  If they are writing are capable of writing code to be relaesed to the public, they are damn sure capable of troubleshooting the existing code.<br>
<br>
My point... you want people to stop bitching about the cost increase (not even going into the upped system requirements BS), then get off your lazy corporate asses and fix the existing problems. You keep asking for more but aren't giving your player base what they deserve.  BLAH <p><a href="http://members.aol.com/wvvetteman/images/dalonhorse1.jpg" target="_blank">

These are just a few of the things that go up without any drastic change in content or perfomance. I want VI to fix EQ problems too but you have to admit that after 3 years some sort of price increase was merited simply as a hedge against inflation. Let's be realistic, people. <p><br><br><center><a href=http://www.midnightfury.org><img src=http://home.austin.rr.com/mav1973/sig3.jpg></a><br><a href=http://www.stomptokyo.com/movies/wicker-man.html><small><b>I am looking for Rowan Morrison.</b></small></a></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ulurikeen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lurikeen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 502<br> <font color=#E9D756>(4/19/02 4:16:53 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3293.topic&index=20>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: RANT-EQ: Plane of Power Expansion</span><hr size=1> <b>Problem stated (for some)</b>: EQ sucks donky di<b></b>cks.

It's still cheaper for me to pay for a month of EQ than it is for one night of going out with friends and bar hopping.  Yeah, customer service sucks.  VI CS dept always has since I first started, and prolly will continue to until I decide it's time to move on.  Patches usually screw up more than they fix, especially when they're &quot;emergency&quot; patches to fix something...  /shrug  <br>
<br>
Maybe I'm just too laid back, but I've come to accept, and expect the usual BS that goes on.  But I find I generally get more enjoyment out of playing than frustration... much like I get more gratification from my job than headaches (most of the time, at least), and therefore stick with it and bear with the bad parts.  <br>

Imagine the waiting time on an actual problem if the customer service number was free. Free, meaning anytime Iownzjoo_513 stole a kill/camp from Fragileplayer_472 that person could not only petition in-game for free, they could call a 1-800 number and eventually whine to an actual person for nothing.<br>

If you opt to stay monthly they enjoy a nice little bonus to income.  If you opt to go yearly they get a steady income stream.  If people leave they were probably on the fence anyway, and the increase to the people staying monthly more than make up for any loss realized.<br>
<br>
Right now EQ is just one big beta test, even if Sony made ZERO profit the experience they getting for the next game is priceless.  The &quot;next game&quot; that comes out that is BETTER will not only get all the people who have already left EQ but will have all the late adopters of EQ migrate over as well.<br>

Basically from a business standpoint HUGE props to SOE, they know how to run a good business.  For all the whinners,... yeah, door is to your left.
