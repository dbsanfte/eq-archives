<br>
In times to come they may &quot;struggle with the Afghanistan question&quot; just like Russia is doing.<br>
<br>
Now, America seems to want to &quot;struggle with the Iraq question&quot;<br>
<br>
Awfully selective who it wants ousted from power. Human rights have zero to do with any decision, otherwise men like Macias Nguema, Idi Amin, Augustin Pinochet, Jean-Bedel Bokassa, Pol Pot and a host of other tyrants would've met American wrath long before they started population control.<br>
<br>
There's money to be made (or saved) in them thar Mesopotamian lands.<br>
<br>
Saddam Hussein has out-lived his usefulness to Washington. Once he was a secular bastion in a region of extremism. He was the good guy in the worthless and costly war with his neighbouring Axis of Evil club-mate Iran. He was even told by the US ambassador to Iraq that the &quot;US has no opinion&quot; on the subject of a Kuwaiti invasion. April Golspie, I believe, was her name.<br>
<br>
The US made it possible for wily and tyrannical survivors like Hussein to exist. <br>
<br>
His used-by date is up. He is in the Washingtom Big Red Book of Bad Guys to be Wasted.<br>
<br>
He is sitting on a fortune of oil that Washington wants control of, indirect or direct.<br>
<br>
Other countries in such positions, like Saudi Arabia, Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan have all been amenable to Uncle Sam.<br>
<br>
Saddam's genocidal behaviour toward Iraq's Kurdish and Assyrian minorities mean nothing. His exclusion of the Shiite majority from any real say in the governing of their country means nothing.<br>
<br>
Except to the UN and Amnesty International, and it makes interesting coffee table reading for armchair pundits.<br>
<br>
Now, in the name of everything red, white and blue, Uncle Sam wants to fight the good fight and rid the world of a vile evil.<br>
<br>
Go for it. He'll be replaced by another vile evil who will make Iraq a useful ally to American foreign policy. Just like in Afghanistan. The Taliban's replacements are no angels of mercy or paragons of democracy either. In fact, democracy is a foreign concept to the Middle East as a rule. Arabs, Pashtuns and Persians have no history of doing things democratically. Don't expect the Dick and the Bush to teach them the right stuff any time soon.<br>
<br>
As for America handing out money to third world countries.  Guess what; so does every other country in the OECD. Far better, from a political point of view, to have victims of charity than a needy people bearing you a grudge.<br>
<br>
With Iraq, it's all about money, not that anyone is dreamy or naive enough to think otherwise. I hope not, anyway. The thing is...whatcha gonna do about it? <p><div align="center"><a href="http://www.ulujain.org">

<br>
Not true. We have atleast 2 grounds to attack. The first is the treaty that ended the 1991 Gulf War. In that treaty iraq was to allow U.N. inspectors in and to get rid of all weapons of mass destruction. They have broken that treaty. Number 2 is the Sept. 14th resolution passed by the Congress that will allow Pres. Bush &quot;To authorize the use of United States Armed Forces against those responsible for the recent attacks launched against the United States.&quot; If iraq was involved in any way we must act to defend ourself.<br>
<br>
And for pulling out of enviromental treaties, it was President Clinton who was against the Kyoto Treaty and the Senate also rejected that same treaty 98-0.<br>
<br>
You know everything that is wrong in this world is not America's fault. Do we do everything right? NO Everything wrong? NO <br>

<br>
let me first of all state that some of your points are valid but you cant help but sound like a knee-jerk &quot;anti-american&quot; to most people here.  notice i did not say you were.<br>
<br>
i will agree that some of my perceptions of the world are colored by my &quot;americanism&quot; and that i may not see some of my blind spots.  if you will allow that you, and many others, have anti-american blind spots as well. <br>
<br>
the only problem i have is your holding up your example of tolerating 25 years of terrorism at the hands of the IRA as an example of how to deal with them.  i must disagree.<br>
<br>
in my opinion, what caused, and contributed, to that ugly stain in history is that justice was not administered equitably.  history is replete with examples of the &quot;haves&quot; lording it over the &quot;have nots&quot;.   i think crimes and criminals should be held accountable.  yes, i'm sure you could throw a lot of example where our american system is faulty and not equitable, but my point is still valid.<br>
<br>
i do not agree that we should put sadam (excuse the spelling) in &quot;time out&quot; for his use of chemical weapons against people, his own or others.  it was not just our &quot;biased&quot; american media reporting this.  <br>
<br>
how many people have to die for it to become a matter for us a nation to become concerned?  you paint us as naive americans for believing our government yet you want us to blindly follow the u.n.   please, i'd rather listen to the self- serving liars in our government who are marginally more concerned with me than self-serving liars from other countries who have NO interest in me.<br>
<br>
YOU are naive if you think YOUR politicians or the UN politicians are any more honorable than our politicians/ citizens.  <br>
<br>
i know what you meant by &quot;understanding&quot; america by visiting new york.  but as the rest of us americans that live elsewhere will tell you, we both love and hate new york/new yorkers.  they both symbolize the best and worst of us.   and if you think you know us because you know them, you are sadly mistaken.   <br>
<br>
so, yes, you bring up a lot of good questions, but your painting of your 25 years of death and violence as a &quot;success&quot; falls flat.  <br>
<br>
you do not gain peace by brute force, but neither do you gain it by determinging that Osama &quot;just had a rough childhood and is in a 'bad place', let's give him some time to think about his actions.&quot;   <br>
<br>
just ask quaddaffi.  <br>
(again, please excuse this poor product of an american education who is too lazy to look up proper spelling)<br>

Yeah, those poor Palastinians. I mean all they do is send wave after wave of suicide bombers in to attack people eating at pizza parlors or at night clubs.

Your comparisons of Israel with New Mexico and California are absurd. The US won these states via conquest.

Negotiating with terrorists is not the answer.  That will just lead to other acts of terrorism by people trying to force what they want on others.  The US does not and will not negotiate with terrorists.<br>

I'd hate to be an Israeli...living with the siege mentality and war psychoses they have would drive me nuts.<br>
<br>
As for the UN, last time I looked the US was on the Security Council, even if they don't pay their dues. The US was a founding member of the UN, and is a member of many of the UN's offshoots.<br>
<br>
Israel is also a member of the UN.<br>
<br>
Personally, I think the UN is an overweight bastion of diplomatic hot air, but it's humanities closest thing to a global voice.<br>
<br>
You can discount UN resolutions all you want; too bad, so sad, they exist, and Israel is not painted lovely shades of pink by it.<br>

I mean all they do is send wave after wave of suicide bombers in to attack people eating at pizza parlors or at night clubs. Their leader is a known terrorist and who is known to sponsor terrorism. They only want to take a piece of land that belongs to another country and make it their own. Those Palastinians, real sweehearts. Please don't talk about "occupied land" or "Isreali occupation." Isreal won the wars fought against them and have the right to claim it. I don't see California or Arizona or New Mexico being called "occupied land" by the people of Mexico.[/quote]<br>
What a pile of ill-informed rubbish! The Palastinians want to take back the occupied lands of Palastine - their country until they were forcibly evicted after the 2nd world war. Not content with driving them out of their country, Israel persued them into the refugee camps of the West bank and Gaza Strip to persecute them further. Israel's actions disgust me, and if it wasn't for Israels money in Western countries, we would be there with everyone else bombing the crap out of Tel Aviv until they stopped massacaring civilians.<br>
It's true Yassar Arafat was a terrorist in the past - so was Nelson Mandela, so was Gerry Adams - you might know that Arial Sharon was convicted by his OWN COUNTRY of war crimes in the 80's. Just because Isreal won wars does not entitle them to occupy land - and that argument surely invites yet more conflict. By that argument Iraq is entitled to Kuwait, but the international community chose to intervene to keep control of oil.<br>

[quote]By the way, Look in you own back yard. For years the government of Great Britain has "occupied" Northern Ireland. How many Catholics died then? Where were you? Where was your calling Great Britain war mongering? Or what of the Falkland Islands? [/quote]<br>
You might do some research and find those situations to be slightly different. Polls of both the Falkland islands and Northern Island will show the people WANT the British government to stay. Yes the Falkland island war was fought to win an election (just as Bush is trying to do now), but then people there wanted it. More people were killed in NI by the more powerful Loyalist (AKA Pro British) factions than the Republicans - the British army actually went in to stop the (historically Irish) Catholics being massacared.<br>

<br>
The US closes it's borders for a period of time.  No more green cards, no more new citizens.  Still allow tourists, but closely monitor their entry and exiting.  Let's stop the influx of people and fix our country, then we can consider letting more in.<br>
<br>
Next I would get rid of the homeless situation.  I would round them all up and ship them all off to work camps.  Give them room/food in exchange for work.  I'm sick of cluttering up our streets with these people.   The young homeless will be placed in foster homes and given a chance to succeed.<br>
<br>
Next thing to go is welfare.  Getting money for doing nothing ends.  You want your welfare check, you get off your fat lazy butt and sweep the streets, pick up trash, paint the curb.  Anything to make you actually earn your money.   This would only be temporary.  After a certain period of time, the money goes away.  GET A DAMN JOB !!<br>
<br>
Eliminate Social Security.  Make it a 20 year phase out plan.  Start decreasing the benifits over time until they are gone in 20 years.   I don't feel it is right to have to support people that weren't smart enough to plan for their future.  It is their families problem, not mine.<br>
<br>
Next thing is to raise the minimum pay for teachers to $100,000 per year (using the money saved from cutting welfare).  Education is our future, and we should get the best and brightest as teachers.  Use the money saved from welfare and social security to build nice schools and great programs.  National standardized tests for all students.  Force students to pass these exams before allowing them to move to next grade.  Don't just pass on problems, fix them.  Educate America !!<br>
<br>
Institute an &quot;ENGLISH ONLY&quot; policy when it comes to government agencies.  Phase this in over time to allow the people that don't speak english now a chance to learn, but in 10 years time, english will be the only language used in all goverment agencies and forms.<br>
<br>
When it comes to the military, the U.S. will become much less friendly with those that harm us.  You shoot one of us, we level your city.  You blow up a building, we level your country.  You leave us alone, we leave you alone.<br>
<br>
Tell the oil companies that they have 20 years to find something else to do.   We already have the technology to get rid of our dependance on fossil fuel.  We will have much less to worry about in the middle east when their supply of funds dries up because no one buys their oil anymore.<br>
<br>
Legalize marijuana.  It is dumb that it is illegal anyway.  It is less harmful and addictive than alcohol.   Sell it like cigarettes.  Regulate it and tax it.  America becomes much happier place.<br>
<br>
<br>
There is a lot more, you just need to vote for me in the next election.  <br>

So you really think he isn't now? If I can recall not more than a couple of months ago a freighter ship was stopped and it's cargo was seized. What was the cargo you ask? Well, I'll tell you. It was a cargo of guns headed to Palestine. A cargo of guns bought illegally and transported illegally by, you guessed it, ol Yassar himself. Glad to know he isn't a terrorist anymore.<br>
