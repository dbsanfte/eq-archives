<br>
Now I know they can be bad.<br>
<br>
However I think that it is the very pick up group that <br>
people love to hate that defines us as players.  It is <br>
through hard ship that we grow stronger.  It is the same<br>
&quot;bad players..terrible groups&quot; that make people stronger <br>
players.  It is easy to be good at what you do when <br>
everything goes perfectly.  It is how we deal with the <br>
bad things that happen that helps us grow.  <br>
<br>
So I would like to thank all those groups that helped me learn to play my characters better.<br>

Anyone else?<br>

I use to avoid pick up groups like the plague until I got on that last stretch for home. (You got it, home=60.)  Of course there were my friends, but there's nothing more annoying (and yes I was annoying as hell) as that person trembling with the taste of 60 on their lips.  I about killed myself lol.  For the most part I did pick ups through 59.  Some were good, some were..../shiver.  All in all it was an experience.  Had times where people would FINALLY get to the room we were headed to, loot would drop, someone would win and they'd bail.  Had a couple 2 hour CRs.  Had a time where I even said screw it and gated at B3 on the way to D2 because a certain bard wouldn't just shut the hell up and stop insulting people. (nope sorry not gonna name anyone <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  )  There were also some very kick ass groups I was with where we got just insane exp, great loot and had a blast.<br>
<br>
I think for the most part a lot of us have found &quot;good&quot; pick up experiences.  Even inside the bad ones.  But hey...it's the bad ones that are fun to rant about. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><center>

I have much experience in PU groups because of this. Overall I'd have to say that the groups are 5% great, 20% good, 65% average, and 10% BAD.  You die from the bad ones, work with the average ones, and have a blast with the good and great ones. I think PU groups are pretty good, in general. I think the bad groups just realy make a larger impression on people than the good or great ones. <p>Ziktiny 51 necro EQ<br>

I haven't been in a guild for a couple months, and before that I was an officer of a guild that had no other members in my level range.  So almost all of my groups have been pickup groups.  Even so, I can only recall two occasions on which there was a serious argument about loot, which is usually one of the biggest knocks on pickup groups.<br>
<br>
On one occasion, a member of MS claimed NBG and was challenged by a member of DG.  The member of MS got mad because a member of UI wouldn't agree that NBG applied.  In other words, three people from uber guilds were arguing over NBG, not a bunch of punks straight from LGuk.<br>
<br>
On the other occasion, a notoriously volatile shaman went into a frenzy because the group wouldn't let him have a slime coated harpoon to give to a friend.<br>
<br>
Maybe I've just been lucky, but I've just never experienced a lot of the horror stories that you hear about. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ulithahntalon.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lith Ahntalon</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/image/globalBlack.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 127<br> <font color=#E9D756>(8/1/01 4:25:04 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: In defense of the Pick up group...</span><hr size=1> In all honesty all it take is one group member to make a BAD group. Someone who bitches about loot, cannot control pets, breaks mezzes, doesn't know what assist is, uses soloing techniques in a group/dungeon setting, doesn't know how to snare/heal/buff/mezz/pull or any other class specific must know trait in a grouping setting, etc, etc, etc. Most BAD groups have one or two idiots and the rest are at the very least competent. I have been leveling my twink and am once again in OS/KC/Velks and have found a decent percentage of the group members know exactly how to runthier class efficently and well and the rest are good to competent with the few notable poor ones. I am not nor will probably never will be as good as my guildies who have my twinks class for a main but, I like to think i do an adequate job and pester my guildies for hints, tips, etc even so the only way I will become proficent is practice, practice, practice is the reason I chose NOT to PL my twink. I think some people have less practice than others and sime just plain suck. All in all I would agree on the percentages above listed though.<br>

Certainly the really bad experiences stick in the mind and help give pickups the bad name. A great thing about pickups is that you get to meet new people. Some of whom you may decide never to group with again. But if all you do is guild groups or people you've known since level 5, you'll neve get to add someone new to /friends, and get an whole bunch of new people together and find a new regular group or whatever. Pickup groups = meet new people = new friends = good. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uglorianafrostglitter.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gloriana Frostglitter</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 611<br> <font color=#E9D756>(8/1/01 9:39:44 pm)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: In defense of the Pick up group...</span><hr size=1> Worst pick up group to date:<br>
<br>
Group in OS jail, a bard was playing both a bard and enchanter but was concentrating on mainly playing the bard.  Stuff was gating, stuff was summoning, it was just a mad house, I finally got summoned someplace and gated out.  <br>
<br>
Bad scene.<br>
<br>
Second worst pick up group:<br>
<br>
Group in OS jail.  Group has 2 paladins and a monk and some other folks.  The monk is pulling from the exit and managed to die near the exit.  I suggested we just clear to the exit to rez him, but the paladins decided to do some kind of freaky &quot;DA run&quot; or something.  Ended up with 2 dead paladins and a dead monk.  The 55 cleric and I make it back up to zone and Mastello was kind enough to drag the bodies.<br>
<br>
Of course, the paladins (one of them bound in the Old World) refuse the sub 56 rezzes and there wasn't a 56+ cleric convenient to rez them.<br>
<br>
Frustrating.<br>
<br>
Last story:<br>
<br>
Ended up in a pick up group in KC.  The warrior wouldn't let us add anymore warriors, didn't want any competition for warrior drops.<br>
<br>
Lame.<br>
<br>
I'm pretty lucky, I had a regular group from 30 to 58 and post 50 have probably been in maybe 5 pick up groups outside of my guild.  Of the 5 or so pick up groups I was in, over half were bad experiences....coincidence?<br>
<br>
I was once in a great pick up group with Anastia though, there was a &quot;perfect&quot; group lfg at the OS zone line and we ended up in bar/chef and had a great time.  I forget the cleric's name, but he was really really nice. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/umindadar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mindadar</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_bluespot.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 242<br> <font color=#E9D756>(8/2/01 12:20:23 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: In defense of the Pick up group...</span><hr size=1> I find that pickup groups are more than likely not super easy exp like grouping with guildies and people you know.

i have known players that have either solo'd or been only in guild groups always.  my impression is that they MAY be limited in &quot;shit-hitting-the-fan-situations&quot; (although god knows those happen in guild raids/groups).   <br>
<br>
i've specifically picked up a lot of paladin and grouping tips in pick up groups.  yep, a lot of exposure to immature/greedy peeps, but it also has exposed me to people NOT in my guild that i consider friends.<br>

Sometimes you get damn lucky and get into a good one and other times you realized your mistake of joining within 5 minutes.  For me, nothing beats a well organized and arranged guild only group.  Doing guild only groups, I go to Chardok all of the time and I was in VL after the upgrade but before the hordes of people coming in.  You never need to worry about a CR, if you die you’re going to get your body back with no problems.<br>
<br>
However pickup groups can be decent as well.  There are times when you can’t do a guild group for a variety of reasons so I’ll resort to pickup groups at this point.  When I was level 48, I joined a Well group in Karnors Castle.  I was there for a solid 4 or 5 hours as main healer with a Bard doing CC.  I had never met these people before but we did a fantastic job and I walked away with a solid 4 yellow bubbles of exp.  Last night I joined a scary pickup group in OS and we went to B1.  Group consisted of a Warrior, Ranger, 2 Enchanters and 2 Clerics.   Normally B1 is not the “best” of camps in OS, but we had a constant stream of Frogs all night and we never really slowed down.  Very refreshing and I made some nice exp.<br>
<br>
Now on the other hand, I have joined pickup groups and realized that I made a horrible mistake.  Like the group where 4 Blue Diamonds dropped over the course of an hour and 2 came up missing (thankfully I got the Blue Diamond that I won)…  Or the group that spends 45 minutes fighting over loot that “potentially” may drop…  I’m a Cleric now.  I’m also pretty well equipped.  I do NOT care about loot.  When I join a pickup group, I just want some experience to get me closer to my next level.  And finally the pickup group that has Solaxun in it…  Now THERE was a mistake.<br>
<br>
All in all, pickup groups aren’t evil.  They can be damn good, but they can also be a total waste of time, exp, and cash (I HATE casting symbol on my group only to find that 2 of them are leaving).<br>

When everyone does their jobs, being an enchanter can get boring.  Pick-up groups provide enough mez breaks, bad pulls, non assisting and non healing to make an enchanters life much more exciting.<br>

<br>
I'd say they do Guild Groups because they have a Guild and there are people in the Guild to group with.<br>
Or perhaps because they just dont want to put in the effort to pull together a good PU group?<br>
<br>
I would have to agree that they are not to good for Pick Up groups. They are just tired of making the effort to first wait for the right people and then make the group work and not flunk out. <br>
<br>
When I dont solo, I have to do Pick Up groups. This because I dont have a Guild (yet) to group with. When/If I get a Guild however, grouping with members of that Guild will be a preference. Not because PU groups have the potential to blow up in your face, but because I have a Guild and darn it they are there to play with.<br>
<br>
Pick up groups become what effort YOU put in to them. If there is a potential FUBAR member of your group, then by the Gods make that person understand.. or leave the group and find another.  <br>

Personally, I find it a LOT quicker and sometimes easier, to get into a pickup group than a guild group. I enter OS and shout level 52 Cleric looking for a group and see what comes my way.  Or wait until I hear &quot;Necro needs a healer.&quot;<br>
<br>
With a guild group, it takes extra time to get everyone together and make arrangements.  FIrst you get to decide where everyone is and where we're all going (Chardok?  The Hole?  Old Seb?  Velks?  Etc). Then you get to pick everyone up (Ok, Cleric is in Qeynos, Enchanter is in Freeport, Ranger and Warrior are fighting there way out of deep Karnors...).<br>
<br>
However, with all of that said, a guild group will almost always come together better than a pickup group.  I also prefer to group with people who I know.  I know that I can trust my Enchanter or that the Monk has a tendency to pull an extra add or 3.<br>
<br>
I do both regularly and am very happy with both for the most part. <br>

<br>
If you are a track athlete and trained for a while and got pretty good, then accomplished something and now only run on occasion, you lost some skills. You stopped getting better. You stopped practicing and now just do it cause you enjoy the running and the excercise. Doesn't matter how long you trained, you're out of practice. Place you against someone who's training now, and you will get dusted. Well, at least your other grampa friends will clap for you.....<br>
<br>
I see a ton of flames coming from people who haven't seen a pickup group in months. If they do still try pickup groups, they whine worse than stubborn newbies.<br>
<br>
It's not easy exp and you shouldn't be dense enough to expect it. You should do pickup groups for other reasons than that.<br>
<br>
There is an increasing amount of higher level folks on our server now. It's gonna start getting crowded, and I have a feeling only the strong will survive. I'd just hate to see the old grampas get owned by someone with inferior gear. tsk tsk <p><B>Mindadar Songmaker</B>- 59 Bard<BR>

<br>
95% of players I either like or admire I met by grouping with them. And yes this includes OS <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  where some great people helped break up the tedium of that long exp slog and taught me something of post 50 spells etc.<br>
<br>
If you judge/ dismiss/ or screw over people simply because they are not guildmates - you only limit your own opportunites in the future. As well as being a tool,  that is <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :evil --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/devil.gif ALT=":evil"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

You dont understand what I'm getting at. People like guild groups because they should be able to trust them. They know the abilities of their group, and the others within it. They have experience working together and therefore become more effective within a group, making themselves a better player.<br>
<br>
It <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> can</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> be much harder to learn how to be a better player <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> if</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> you dont trust your group enough to experiment with tactics/spells.<br>
<br>
Also if a friend screws up, its a lot easier to shrug it off than if some guy you've never met before gets you killed. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uninyalita.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ninya Lita</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 248<br> <font color=#E9D756>(8/5/01 8:36:57 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: In defense of the Pick up group...</span><hr size=1> Your cleric tells the group, &quot;Complete heal on *insert enchanter name here*&quot;<br>
