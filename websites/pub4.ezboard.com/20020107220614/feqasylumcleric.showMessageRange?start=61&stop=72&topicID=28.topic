The group decided we would all roll.  We did.  She won.  It is hers.  It is hers to use, sell or give away.  <br>
<br>
I do recall the warrior telling her congrats.  He had no ill will towards her for winning.<br>
<br>
Now, she did use it a bit.  SHe never never risked our health to do so.<br>
<br>
Would it have been better in the warriors hands?  Perhaps.  But again WE ALL decided that WE ALL roll.  She won.<br>
<br>
Her roll playing is not the issue for this post.  The weapon is.  I was there.  It is hers fair and square.<br>

You are right, RP wasn't the issue in its acquisition, it was just the reason for my aspiration to use it, but some love to bash me for it.<br>
<br>
And the flame posts? I won't reply in kind. Flame posts &gt; /ignore.<br>
<br>
Someday a few people will learn each of us can play (or roleplay) our own characters as we wish, and we all choose who we interact with.<br>
<br>
Good luck getting a Jade Mace, Worthy. Whether you decide to equip it if you got one is up to you, but I'd advise you don't announce it though if you do, looking at the range of abusive responses I have received simply for achieving such a 'disgraceful' goal.<br>
<br>
Enjoy your gaming, everyone.<br>

In the given situation, it was agreed that all members were to be allowed to roll. That is totally acceptable, and she won fair and square and it is hers to do with as she wishes.<br>
<br>
Now, I think that it is same to assume that Felishanna's use of roleplay as valide reason for being included in a hypothetical need before greed situation that has come under debate.<br>
<br>
What it boils down to:<br>
<br>
Is roleplaying a valide &quot;need&quot; in a need before greed situation? <p><hr>

<br>
1) That is really the first time a weapon has come up that Both me and a Warrior wanted. I was always under the perception that most of the 1HS or 2HS weapons are so much better than any weapon that a cleric could ever get that why would one ever bother with 1HB weapons? And, the Warrior Class gets so many to choose from.(i.e. How many darn YAKS are there out there?) I had no idea that this weapon was that good, and, I can see how a warrior would do better with it than I. (I assumed the warrior got better Dammage due to strength, I did not know the Dam Multiple was X2 for Clerics, and X5 for warriror, tho I did know about double attacks) That does not mean that I still do not want one, but, I can be alot more reasonable about waiting to get it. Probably end up buying one someday. I will say, in my defense, at the time that I wanted it, I really did want it to use as a weapon. I have had my Cad of Sacrament for about 20 levels now. I was thrilled to see something drop that was better. Was it such a great crime to want a Nice weapon? I just did not understand at the time the potential power of it. ( When I was thinking of good warrior weapons, I would think of things that do 20-30 DAM. Untill I really looked at the DPS, I did not really consider the Jade Mace to be that desierable by a warrior.)<br>
<br>
2) When I saw the reactions I got when I asked to roll for it, I will admit, I was shocked. THAT is why I made this post. I wanted FRIENDLY FEEDBACK! If my mindset was so that I was 100% sure I was right, then, I would not post and ask for opinions. But, I did ask, so I could learn and get others points of view. I stated my reasons, and what I was thinking. so you could see MY side of it. Does not mean I was right, but, just where I was comming from.<br>
<br>
3) As I said, Friendly Feedback. This thread became a FLAME/HATE Session for too many people here. A point can be made by stating facts about what you think. People who are posting Hate messages are just lowering themselves. If I do not like how a person plays, I make it a point to avoid grouping with that person in the future. BUT, I let other people make their own judgements upon that person. I might warn of specific actions that an individual has taken, but, I will not lower myself to Name calling and personality bashing. (i.e. The SLUT comment was uncalled for!! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ) Comments like that do not belong here. I do not understand why people are so insecure with themselves that they feel that, to raise themselves up, they have to bring others down.<br>
<br>
4) If I have upset people in the way I play my character, I am sorry. If I actually suck that bad as a cleric in your eyes, I will now make a point to avoid contact with you, so, you will not have to worry about me endangering you any more. I have noted your opinions on this board, and will respect that. I try to play good in my opinion, but, I also know I cannot please every body.<br>
<br>
I am sorry that this thread caused so much hate. Be well.<br>

Personally putting Felishanna down like somepeople do is just childish and in my opinion uncalled for. But that isn't the issue of my post my post is to give Worthy an option in getting his mace. If you really want to get a Jaded Mace get some Guildies or some true friends together and camp it. There will be no fighting over who should get it because they are camping it for you. If Felishanna wanted to get the Mace like she said she did without all this controverse I would of helped her get the item myself with anyone else that is kind enough to. I mean what the hell was I doing in Dreadlands with Stillnight camping the Dread Widow for her Mini GBS. Was it for the 300pp I got in Splits? Was it for the 26 Silk Swatches I got from killing all these spiders that I gave away since my tailoring is over what silk swatches can do for me? Was it for the 2 mobs I acctually got EXP for over the 7 hours I was there with her? No it was because I knew she wanted it and I knew I could help a friend out to get something they wanted and made them happy. So Worthy get a few friends together it might take you a week or two or even a month or so to get it but you can get it if you REALLY want it. <br>

I completely agree, congrats Fel.<br>
<br>
The only thing I disagree with is IF a cleric is placed on an equal basis because thier item says a cleric can use.  It sets a bad precident because there are a LOT of items a cleric needs but a warrior can use.  I think it would be disasterous for us to take things that others need because we can wear/wield them.<br>
<br>
I have yet to see a warrior wearing adamtite epolets.  But I am pretty sure they are wearable by all plate classes.  Would be ashame for the next cleric/warrior item with +WIS to go to a warrior just because he thought he wanted to roleplay a WISER person. <p><HR>

<br>
My issues are not with you.  I have been &quot;schooled&quot; by a large number of outstanding tanks on weapon effectiveness.  As I read my original post to you I can see how it could be taken as a bit harsh.  It was not meant to be, call it a combination of a subject that makes my teeth grate and perhaps a bad RL day, not sure to be honest.  Either way I am sorry it was written/perceived that way, the follow on issue really has nothing to do with you.<br>
<br>
This issue deals with Felishana and I.  She knows it has nothing to do with &quot;Role Play&quot; one way or another.  But that is neither here nor there.  I am posting because I think you got innocently caught up in something that has been brewing for a while and I wanted to apologize to you for bringing you into it.<br>
<br>
One other little thing, Arios's Post (in which &quot;Slut&quot; was used) was a PARODY of a USENET flame.  Read it that way and perhaps you will see the joke.  The first line is a bit dated and I am not sure of your age, but I think you said you were about 30?  If so you should remeber the old Saturday Night Live Skit with Dan Akroid and Jane Curtain.  It was called &quot;Point/Counter Point&quot;.  Dan Akroid would open up his dialogue the same each time &quot;Jane, you ignorant slut&quot;.  This is where that joke comes from...sigh, nevermind now I am dating myself...:P<br>
<br>
Anyway to bring this to a close, this is between Felishana and I.  If I were a true &quot;flamer&quot; there would be a large number of issues I would bring up.  Yes I avoid her, not like Clerics need to group together, it is how she affects my friends that concerns me.<br>
<br>
Hang in there Worthy,<br>

Maybe 99% of the time with Worthy that isn't the case, maybe that day it was late, maybe blah blah blah.  Point is, I was trying to make a point, but in order to make a point that held water, I chose to use a situation that I was in, and shared how it affected me and my group. Please decide for yourself based on experience whether you wish to group with a cleric of this sort, don't let me dictate your grouping partners to you, I didn't intend to, nor would I wish to.<br>
