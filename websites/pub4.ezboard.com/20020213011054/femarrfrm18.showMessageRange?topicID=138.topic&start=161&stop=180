What Im sayin is this:<br>
<br>
As far as being too easy,<br>
If there was solid proof in a God then logically one would be quite stupid not to believe it. Worship him is another question entirely. The christian faith teaches that one should worship off faith alone cause if you can maintain that faith then it shows you truly want the rewards promised to you in the end<br>
<br>
As far as why I have faith,<br>
I see two ways to believe. I can believe in a supreme being or I cannot. I choose to believe, even without &quot;solid&quot; proof (in my mind I have all the proof I need), in the christian faith cause it promises some really cool stuff in the end whereas the alternative is pretty lame to put it mildly <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>Trech Maggotface (Retired)<br>

For example, I believe it is wrong to steal, kill, etc, but I can't prove it. I can use a different word to &quot;wrong&quot;, such as &quot;detrimental to humanity as a whole&quot;, and come up with reasonable arguments. But I can't prove that actions detrimental to humanity are wrong, without invoking theological arguments, which is rather hard as an atheist. So these beliefs do not have a logical basis. However, I think you'ld have just as hard a time proving that they act contrary to some form of logic. If you define &quot;illogical&quot; as &quot;without logic&quot; then I'll accept that my beliefs are illogical. If on the other hand you define &quot;illogical&quot; as &quot;counter to logic&quot; then I don't think they are, and nor are the beliefs of those of most religious faiths.<br>
<br>
A belief in God is something which does not require proof. I don't have that faith, but I don't deny that others do. On the other hand, I have yet to see (and don't believe I ever will see) anything resembling a proof that God (as most people define him/her/it) exists. The most common arguements I see involve biblical quotes, which can't be seen as a proof if you don't believe that it God exists for the Bible to be the word of. Bootstrapping like that ain't going to work.<br>
<br>
Poppen's story is moving, and I don't have an explanation, but I don't see it as proof of an intelligent, benevolent deity. Static apnea (underwater breath holding) records are only around 6 and a half minutes, and these are adults who train for it. But they don't go so far as to fall into a coma. To me this shows that there's a lot of things we don't understand yet. There's lots of room in the realm of &quot;what we don't understand&quot;, and a deity could fit there, but I don't see it being required.<br>
<br>
Then we get to arguments about creation of the universe, or existance of life/man/etc.<br>
&gt;  Even science agrees that the universe has not always been here<br>
Not really. Many (most?) cosmologists would argue that the laws of physics, which include the concept of time, were formed with the big bang. As such there isn't a &quot;time&quot; &quot;before&quot; it. As you get closer to the actual event, the concept of time becomes not too well defined.<br>
<br>
One theory I read somewhere that kind of appealed to me. Quantum fluctuations allow the creation of matter from nothing given certain boundary conditions on the duration of the time the matter exists, and it's actual mass/energy (product of the two is less than hbar if my memory of 3rd/4th year uni physics is not as rusty as I think it is). Now it looks to me like you need to allow &quot;negative enery/mass&quot; to get this to work (which wouldn't be the same as antimatter), but if the mass is small enough, you can have a universe that exist for a long period of time, being spontaneously created from vacuum... further surfing lead me to <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://hbar.stanford.edu/linde/">Andrei Linde's webpage</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->. A physics proffesor at Stanford, who as several papers and links regarding &quot;self-reproducing inflationary universe&quot; theories, which seems to be what I'm talking about, except he mentions fractals, which of course makes it infinately cooler <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> . I'll have to read those papers at some stage.<br>
<br>
Can life be spontaneously created? Its not hard to show that amino acids can be produced &quot;naturally&quot;, and I'd say you've really got to clutch at straws to come up with anything resembling hard probability of creating simple self-replicating molecules from there. That's to give either a high or low probability. It's another of those &quot;we just don't know enough&quot; things. First question: How many planets have the required amino acids on them, and for how long do we run the &quot;experiment&quot; to create life.<br>
<br>
In the end, I can always invoke the anthropic principle to justify the odds of the existence of life, our biodiversity, and complexity, no matter how long the odds.<br>
<br>
Lastly, being correct about something (existance of God, evolution, the theory that a high velocity piece of lead isn't a healthy thing to introduce to a human body), doesn't prevent one causing attoricities, wars, whatever. The existance or non-existance of God has no real bearing on religious wars. That has more to do with the church. And Largar, were you aware that Samuel Verner, who brought Ota Benga to the US to display in the zoo, was a Christian missionary? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uwealthacquirer.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Wealth Acquirer</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 20<br> <font color=#E9D756>(9/18/01 11:04:47 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=138.topic&index=164>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Wow</span><hr size=1> I must admit that some of the comments, opinions, and theories here have had me alternately between applauding, screaming, laughing, and putting my fist through the monitor.<br>
<br>
However, one thing has remained constant.<br>
<br>
For the first time that I can remember, the thread has actually remained NICE, POLITE, UNDERSTANDING, and CARING.  Wth the sheer number of posts, the odds for this board strongly favor a flame war at this point.<br>
<br>
I guess it can be summed up as follows.  (thinks back to a philosophy course)<br>
      The believers will  never want to stand up to logical examination, and the logicians will never have true faith.<br>
<br>
While neither side is necessarily better or more important, what remains is that we are all human.  We deserve the right to express an opinion, and more importantly we deserve the right to defend it peacefully, calmly, and openly.<br>
<br>
Do I believe in god?  Good question.  All i do know is that things like this restore my hope for Man.<br>
<br>
I applaud all for their efforts, and am truly glad to see people following Verants PnP.  :P (had to get that one in!)<br>
<br>
Now for the challenge.  Regardless of the discussion, let's try to keep more threads like this.  Calmly and rationally discuss what ever the topic is without highlighting things in a manner that reflects poorly on the Rebuttal.<br>
In other words, don't make fun of spelling, grammar, etc.  And whenever your opinion disagrees, STFU is not a valid reply.  That is one that is on this place far to often, and immediately requires a response referring to contsitutional rights. (Damn Americans thinking they own everything... <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  jk.

<br>
So please, play nice.  Talk nice.  Be nice.   (but no one ever said you had to agree!)  This is the way things should be on this board.<br>

"As what would be the point to make a creature...give it a mind capable of logical reasoning, leave no logical proof that you created them; and yet expect them to figure out that you created them and worship and praise you for such an act." <br>
<br>
Um...what do you think all the prophets were for, if not to tell and remind people about G-d?  G-d chose to divinely inspire people, and have them deliver His word.  Some of them (i.e. Jonah) did not want to.  Many (i.e. Daniel) were punished for doing so.  Yet G-d continued to inspire prophets and they continued to spread his word.<br>
So you see, G-d did not leave it up to us to "figure out" that He exists.  He sent the prophets to tell us and remind us.  There are no modern day prophets (that I know of), however, most people today know of Him, whatever faith they follow, and whether they believe in Him or not.  There is not the need for prophets today that there was in Ancient Israel.<br>
As for why some of us believe, every believer has his or her own reasons.  I have experienced G-d in ways no argument can debunk, so I know G-d is real.  I don't need logic to believe; I need faith, and G-d has inspired me to have that faith.  Can I show you evidence of my experiences?  No.  G-d doesn't give concrete proof.  G-d gave us free will, and He lets us use it.<br>

<br>
1) Christ is a title, meaning &quot;Saviour&quot;. Jesus Christ, as you know him, was not his true name, but a title. More accurately, he was Jesus the Christ, or Jesus the Saviour. Thus the term &quot;Christians&quot; means &quot;Followers of the Saviour&quot;.<br>
<br>
2) Yes it was proven that a man named Jesus walked the earth around the timeframe given biblically. Nothing more.<br>
<br>
3) Evolution : Actually there have been many changes in the human skeletal structure since the times Jesus and them walked the earth. Hence, evolution.<br>
<br>
4) Yes, it it true there are many things that scientists cannot prove. As there were many more things scientists could not prove in the past. And, like today, those things that were unproven, were said to have no explanation but &quot;the hand of god&quot;. In each given era, scientists, or thier &quot;followers&quot; are too arrogant to admit that they just have not progressed far enough to figure out the next phase in answering their own question.<br>
<br>
5) Yes, religion and religious differences have caused the deaths of hundreds of thousands of men, women, and children. Does no one remember the Holy Wars? The Crusades? Going to war &quot;for god and country&quot;? The inquisitions (of which there were many)? Soldiers marching, in the belief that it was God's command, to slaughter thousands of people. Carving up the men, defiling the women, and smashing the bodies of infants. All in God's name. Amen. (Which, for those who do not know, means &quot;so be it&quot;.)<br>
<br>
A couple things that have puzzled me though.<br>
<br>
1) God flooded the world and only saved Noah and his family. So, after the flood was over, was there mass inbreeding? Or did god just start making more people out of clay? The Bible never mentions things of this nature.<br>
<br>
2) Why was Lylith (Adam's first wife) never spoken of after she left Adam?<br>
<br>
3) In the book of Genesis, God refers to himself as &quot;we&quot; and &quot;us&quot; : &quot;We can not let them eat from the fruit of life or they will become like us.&quot; Does God have Multiple Personality Disorder? Are we looking at a case of Gods and Demi Gods?<br>
<br>
4) Cain was &quot;marked&quot; and sent off, but again, never spoken of afterward.<br>
<br>
5) After the exile of Adam and Eve, the Bible speaks of Adam living for 900 years (or so), as it follows Adam's liniage, it finalizes with God saying that &quot;they are too much like us.&quot; At which point God shortens Man's lifespan to 80 years. And people say smoking cuts your life short... sheesh.<br>
<br>
6) After the exile of our fine young couple. The bible begins to speak of other people. Again, did god just start manufacturing people out of clay? The bible didn't mention where they came from. Just suddenly POOF, we got surrounded.<br>
<br>
7) The Bible never speaks of Jesus's childhood, did he have his wet dreams? Was he ever caught off in the stables jerking off like the other boys? Inquiring minds want to know.<br>
<br>
One of the things George Carlin said that I found very funny :<br>
<br>
&quot;What about the Devine Plan? Remember that? The Devine Plan. Long time ago, God made a Devine Plan. Gave it alot of thought, decided it was a good plan and put it into practice. And for billions and billions of years the Devine Plan has been doing just fine. Now you come along and pray for something. Well supose the thing you want, isn't in God's Devine Plan? What do you want him to do? Change his plan? Just for you? Doesn't it seem a little arrogant? It's the Devine Plan! What's the use in being God, if every run-down schmuck with a $2 prayer book can come along and fuck up your plan?<br>
And here's something else, another problem you might have. Supose your prayers aren't answered? What do you say? Well it's God's will. Thy Will be done. Fine.

Guess what?  I'm actually going to answer your questions.  I knew that BA in Religion & Biblical Literature had to come in handy sometime.<br>
<br>
1) God flooded the world and only saved Noah and his family. So, after the flood was over, was there mass inbreeding? Or did god just start making more people out of clay? The Bible never mentions things of this nature.<br>
<br>
     Noah's three sons all went to different parts of the world with their families.  There they found people who had not been flooded.  This is confusing, yes, since God is supposed to have flooded the world.  As a scholar, I say that what the Bible means is God flooded Noah's world.<br>
<br>
2) Why was Lylith (Adam's first wife) never spoken of after she left Adam?<br>
<br>
     First of all, the name Lilith is not in the Bible.  The first creation story says that God created man and woman together -- but doesn't name them.  The second one involves Adam's rib and names Adam and Eve.  Lilith is a story Rabbis made up to explain the contradiction.  And Lilith didn't leave Adam; God sent her away at Adam's request.  Adam was pissed because Lilith wanted to be on top during sex.  Supposedly, she is now a demon who sucks out the souls of newborns.<br>
<br>
3) In the book of Genesis, God refers to himself as "we" and "us" : "We can not let them eat from the fruit of life or they will become like us." Does God have Multiple Personality Disorder? Are we looking at a case of Gods and Demi Gods?<br>
<br>
Kings and Queens are entitled to refer to themselves as "we."  God is the King of Heaven.  Why shouldn't He say "We?"  Then there is the fact that God is Three in One and One in Three -- the Trinity.  Just because Jesus was not yet incarnated in Genesis doesn't mean He wasn't around, and the Holy Spirit surely was.  That's another reason for "We" and "Us."<br>
<br>
4) Cain was "marked" and sent off, but again, never spoken of afterward.<br>
<br>
This isn't a question.<br>
<br>
5) After the exile of Adam and Eve, the Bible speaks of Adam living for 900 years (or so), as it follows Adam's liniage, it finalizes with God saying that "they are too much like us." At which point God shortens Man's lifespan to 80 years. And people say smoking cuts your life short... sheesh.<br>
<br>
This one's not a question, either.<br>
<br>
6) After the exile of our fine young couple. The bible begins to speak of other people. Again, did god just start manufacturing people out of clay? The bible didn't mention where they came from. Just suddenly POOF, we got surrounded.<br>
<br>
Adam and Eve were offered Eden.  God's other creations were not.  That's not hard to understand, is it?<br>
<br>
7) The Bible never speaks of Jesus's childhood, did he have his wet dreams? Was he ever caught off in the stables jerking off like the other boys? Inquiring minds want to know.<br>
<br>
In fact, there _are_ a few mentions of his childhood, such as debating with the Holy Men in the Temple and impressing them (this is probably why Jesus was trained as a Rabbi).  Of course, as Kevin Smith points out in Dogma, it would presumably take a long time to accept that one is the Son of God!<br>
Ooh, Jesus jerking off, how shocking!  Like no one has asked this before.  Now, since Jesus was both Human and Divine, he quite possibly had normal adolescent Human urges.  Whether or not he acted on them, I don't presume to speculate.<br>
<br>
So, I hope that clears up a few things for you.<br>

<br>
Ah, no. The difference is that 2000 years from now people will be able to pull from multiple sources with multiple biases and gather information about what happened to WTC, the people and the USA. That can't be said about the Bible. I shouldn't have to point out that 1) there are no original &quot;scriptures&quot; that can be examined. 2) What fragments are available to scholars have been &quot;modified&quot; by scribes through that ages. 3) The writters of the texts that compose the canons for Old Testament and New Testament of the Christian bible are relatively unknown. For example, we don't *know* who actually wrote the Gospel of &quot;Luke&quot;. 4) The current christian canon was voted upon by the Council of Nicea in the 4th century AD. Sure took a long time for christians to figure out what the &quot;word of God&quot; was! =) 5) There are no other historical texts outside of the New Testament that can collaborate what the Gospels say about a man named Jesus. Some here have quoted Josephus, but if they did their home work they would know that the quotes they offer are considered spurious by most New Testamanent scholars today (perhaps those who offer Josephus should stop reading Josh McDowell and counting a columnist as a scholar!).<br>
<br>
Finally, the idea that the &quot;Word of God&quot; (Old and New Testaments of the Bible) is inerrant is laughable at best and only the most fundamental even consider such a doctrine.<br>

You need to take a look back in this thread and read through the posts that deal with faith. <br>
<br>
Part of a christians faith is knowing that the bible has been through the hands and revisions of many secular authorities but still having a trust in God that his word and teachings still made it through.

It's true that logic deals with facts, but you certainly can use it to discuss and/or support an idea that is not yet a concrete fact.  Otherwise we could not use logic to discuss ideas that are not yet proven, such as a hypothesis or theory.  The existence of god is a theory.  It has not been logically disproven, and thus is not illogical in the least.  By your definition, anything that has not been proven as fact is inherently illogical.  If that were true then logic would be useless, since the whole point of it is to determine truth.<br>
I cut and pasted some definitions of logic from dictionary.com, but I'm not sure how useful they are within the context of this thread.  Here they are anyway, in case anyone cares.<br>
<br>
log·ic (ljk)<br>
n. <br>
The study of the principles of reasoning, especially of the structure of propositions as distinguished from their content and of method and validity in deductive reasoning. <br>
<br>
A system of reasoning: Aristotle's logic. <br>
A mode of reasoning: By that logic, we should sell the company tomorrow. <br>
The formal, guiding principles of a discipline, school, or science. <br>
Valid reasoning: Your paper lacks the logic to prove your thesis. <br>
The relationship between elements and between an element and the whole in a set of objects, individuals, principles, or events: There's a certain logic to the motion of rush-hour traffic. <br>
Computer Science. <br>
The nonarithmetic operations performed by a computer, such as sorting, comparing, and matching, that involve yes-no decisions. <br>
Computer circuitry. <br>
Graphic representation of computer circuitry. <br>

Please cite a source to support your allegation? Just one source that is easily read by most. I doubt you have one. And, if you did it only supports what I said about &quot;multiple biases&quot; all biased accounts would agree that there was a WW2 that involved both Japan and the US. That can't be said about Jesus. There are no first person reports of Jesus apart from the spurios and biased reports found in the gospel (one sided story!).<br>

Ah, have you? DO you recall what I wrote about &quot;faith&quot;? It is easy to retreat to faith, but please don't use it as an excuse for a lack of knowledge or laziness to find facts as you seem to be doing. When the cards are against you then go do some study and fact finding, but don't insult the many generations of theologians and other biblical scholars with a cheap retreat to &quot;I have faith!&quot; The fact is Trech that many with faith understand that the Bible is not the inerrant &quot;Word of God.&quot; They *know* the Bible is a flawed historical record and it doesn't take anything away from their &quot;faith&quot; at all.<br>

As for the two creation stories, they are indeed _both_ in the Bible.

Read the Book of Genesis, and you will see that the creation story is in fact in there two times, with differences.<br>
