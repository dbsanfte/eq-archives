However other camps like most in South Karana etc are ffa/sharable. <br> <br> The most important thing for you to do when backed into a corner by someone else who is being immature and less than dignitary is to allways keep your calm. There is <u>never</u> a reason for you or anyone else to lower thier standard of gameing ettiquite to thiers. When both sides of an argument flame into throwing harsh language, or in your case as the harsh language seems to have been relatively one sided there was still a bit of name calling and generally deragotory statements that couldn't have done anything but inflame the situation further. <br><br> Also in defense of Frizz when a situation gets to the level that yours obviosly did and tempers are that heated, it is also much more difficult for him to diffuse the situation, which, contrary to many popular beliefs is primarily what they are there for. They do not come over and simply decide "Newbie00 is right! and you are wrong. I will now forcefully decline you entrance to this zone untill they are finished" etc etc. they are there to help <u>both</u> sides of the argument settle the problem and defuse the situation. That is all. Again I'm sorry for your experiance and I hope you manage to resolve the issue :) Be well.<br> <p><center><img src="http://fp1.centurytel.net/sect/Stored%20Sigs/AeonSignitureGMlrg.jpg"></center> <center><a href=mailto:Aeonestra@hotmail.com>"Ultimate power is the spawn of ulimate intelligence.

Gm's Bah</span><hr size=1> Well well well. Steelfists at it again is he? I was in Highhold Pass the other day and I have to say as an aside that the grouping experience there can be wonderful to frustrating to downright exasperating. The pickclaw rooms in High Keep are no exception and I got so fed up with the Orc groups I didnt even bother to try there and head out for Karana, which I suggest is what you do if you dont mind me saying.<br><br>Steelfists is an idiot, regardless of this understandably debatable offence. He was deliberately and willfully not respecting the play nice code and was deliberately and willfully KSing the ORC spawns at Highpass on Saturday. I was grouped there and he was just being an unbelievabley bad sport as he said and in a rather childish way 'i need to get my f****** faction' and was peppering his chat with such expletives and ruining the experience for many. He decided to camp at the top of the rocky outcrop and KS anything that spawned for about half an hour. I was about to offer him a duel (I would have kicked his lizard behind) but after basically reducing his claims to rubble through a few well placed tells he finally got the message and moved off. Cry baby comes to mind and the happening at HK highlights this, as far as I am concerned if the entire group moves off to bank or whatever they are doing they have surrendered there the right to the spawn and therefore take their chances. Its like camping at the orcs the whole group moving off to the bank at high keep and then returning and expecting to re-take their place not realistic is so satan i undersatnd your point but you seem to missing the point there; it dont matter that the bank just happends to be upstairs you just do the decent thing and acceed to other players haveing there chance other wise where do you draw the line?<br><br>There is a level of frustration ineherent in both of these zones in that spawns are erratic and it is very easy to train a mob when innocently passing on your way to Kithicor and in the case of HK up to the bank which is really frustrating when you are changing up your loot and get picked on by a lvl33 goblin not nice. However, steelfists is an obvious fool who has not really any understanding of what it is to actually play a game for the enjoyment of it and properly wait his turn for a spot in the group.  This area is nearly always fully camped and most wait there turn as is the pickclaw room.<br><br>Players like this especially twinked up to the eyeballs should be avoided like the plague, dont group with them and dont allow them to intimidate you.<br><br>Numnayven Darkdeed - Order of the Ebon Tear<br>Warrior of Neriak <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uwenolanwisetree.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Wenolan Wisetree</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>w4nn4b3!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(5/3/01 3:43:30 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=500.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Just some technical points</span><hr size=1> If they came back as wolves, they had to be turned into wolves in the zone, because as you know, zoning cancels wolf form.<br><br>In your post, you say you didn't see anyone in the room and told your group to move in. I don't know about you but personally, even seeing the room empty, I'd make sure the people camping it really left before moving. It never hurts to send a /ooc or a tell if you know who's camping it.<br><br>You also said they came back after 2min. It doesn't seem they left that long then. 2min and the time you took to move in, that'd make maybe 5min. Just the time I'd say to turn in some ears, have a small talk with a druid to get wolf form and come back. I wouldn't really call that leaving a camp...<br><br>You saw an opportunity to take the camp when they had a quick break and took it. I agree you didn't know they were coming back but you didn't even ask. I (again personally) would have given them their camp back since they just left for 5min.<br><br>I understand how you feel though. I don't like twinks. I think it's unfair to real newbies and non-twinked chars. Not because the twinks didn't get their stuff by themselves, but because they can handle bigger mobs at same level, or at least much more safely and easily.<br><br>But there's no law against twinking, and anyone has the right to twink. Seeing 2 twink monks holding a nice hunting area where it'd be much more useful to your group can make you feel bitter or seem unfair.<br><br>I won't comment what happened later since I have no right to do so.<br><br>Don't get me wrong though. I don't say you were right to move in or not, I just say that this kind of situation can be prevented if you're just a bit cautious, especially in places like Highpass where there are heavy training, KSing and camp problems.<br><br>As for Frizznik, he does a great job usually but in this kind of situation, he can't do anything but invoke the Play nice Policy. It's your word against Steel's.<br><br>I hope you have better luck next time. Or move to the Lake of Ill Omen.
