<br>
As I was about to finish walking across the picket fence my brother for some odd reason started to shake the shit out of the fence and I lost my balence so I lifted one leg up and came crashing down, landing on one of the picket fence's many &quot;spikes,&quot; needless to say a portion of the white picket fence was no longer white and was now red, and I had landed on my testicles. I really don't know if I had stitches put in because I don't notice any stitch markings on my ball sack, and I have never seen another man's ball sack to notice the difference. I was really young and it's hard for me to remember the situation. <br>
<br>
All I remember afterwards was people carrying me after I fell from the red picket fence to my house, where I was crying my eye's out, my pants were drenched in blood. My mom came to the door, slapped me, hugged me, and gave me a peice of gum to make me stop crying, the gum worked. I was then rushed to the hospitol, where I knocked out. <br>

<br>
When I was about 10 or so, my friend's and I would go down to a creek, which was right by our house and we'd find baby frogs, we had about 100 of them, put them all in a bucket, brought them to school and started throwing them on the ground and stepping on them. <br>
<br>
----<br>
<br>
When I was about 13 I went on a &quot;swooping&quot; ride with my brother and his friend's. We'd go to a local mall and find a woman...drive slowly by her and stick our hands out the window and grab her ass. Did on several different occassions, old and young. <br>

I was messing around one day trying to climb a tree in my neighborhood, my brother comes by with a friend and they decide to take it a step further and clib a telephone pole. My brother goes up first, he's pretty high, about 2 stories high, and then he just falls, his friend starts laughing hysterically, I start laughing also, because we thought my brother was laughing too, but he was really in pain, so much pain that we thought he was laughing and not crying, he broke his arm. <br>

First one that's not mine:<br>
<br>
Friend who's a tutor at Sydney Uni goes out drinking at Kuleto's (2 for one cocktails at happy hour, 2 happy hours in the one night - I think it's Tuesdays). After a few too many Long Island Ice Teas, he's lying in the gutter and THEN realises that half his students live and go out around here.<br>
<br>
OK. For me:<br>
Dad introduced me to abseiling. I thought this was really cool fun, so decided to practice it in a tree in the back yard. But I didn't know where the gear was, so I used the very thin, old, leather belt that came from around the top of Dad's scout hat. But it was the piece of rope (string?) that I was using that broke. When I'm in hospital Dad brought me a present: a book on abseiling (safely). Inside cover he's written &quot;Just one day too late&quot;.<br>
<br>
On the way to a physics lab I pass some friends at the uni bar who've been there an hour or two. &quot;Come drink with us&quot;. &quot;But I gotta get to this lab&quot; &quot;Sure, just catch us up and then you can go&quot;. &quot;OK&quot;. I caught up and went to the lab, and I'm rather grateful that my lab partner did most of the work that day.<br>
<br>
&quot;Where'd that pill go?&quot; &quot;Dunno. Maybe I didn't give it to you. Here have this&quot; &quot;Thanks&quot;. So I took a second pill (E) 5 minutes after the first, and had a wonderful conversation with a cat.<br>
<br>
Drinking gin + tonics to drown with a friend. I think the stupid shit was going to buy the third bottle of gin. At least we were smart enough to realise that it didn't need to be good stuff any more. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ushnarfshnarf.showPublicProfile?language=EN>shnarf shnarf</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_ninja.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 406<br> <font color=#E9D756>(2/18/02 9:46:47 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrreallife.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=223.topic&index=217>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: stupid shit you've done..</span><hr size=1> During my freshman year at college, I managed to consume 2 pure mdma pills, 1/2 ounce of kind bud w/some friends, and about 8 cans of bucsh light.<br>

We decided to move the party down to the beach and have a bon fire. I drank more beer and started throwing up everywhere from all the crap in my system. The next thing I knew I was walking on water pretending I was jesus. It was a cold night, the water was even colder. I was told by my friends i was knee deep in water for about 20 minutes screaming at the top of my lungs that I was jesus and i was walking on water.<br>
<br>
I had the flu for about one week after that. <p><br>Shnarf <br><i>"Spaces and steps, which provides meaning within itself to it's interpreter's"<i><br>

The stuff we smoked was A grade shit. By the time me and my mate left this girl's house we were totalled in a major way.<br>
<br>
I remember walking to Engadine station and how long it took us. I stopped several times and walked back several hundred yards to where I was earlier, all due to the fact that I couldn't remember if I'd walked it before or not.<br>
<br>
After getting off our train we came towards a gas station and there was a fucking leprechaun under the driveway canopy. I remember he was gurgling...he was evil in a major way. I knew then that he represented everything sinister about Mother Nature. He was not a happy little man at all.<br>
<br>
Naturally I went home in a hurry and for years the friend I was with would not let me live it down about leprechauns under gas station canopies.<br>

It definately has to be &quot;A&quot; grade to make you hallucinate, plus you have to be in the right state of mind. <p><center><img src="http://www.users.bigpond.com/raymies/rolelen10.jpg">

About 5 of us went paintballing at the city dump. I brought my digital camcorder and filmed the entire thing and will try to get it up on the web. Best scene is a friend of mine riding on the side of a tractor shooting at a friend of ours. It ends with a supervisor kicking us out, even though we payed our 8 dollars to get in. <p>~Krim

To get back on topic, I was driving around and hit a bunch of trash cans just goofing with a friend and it turned out to be a cops house. I got a $50 ticket. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :\ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":\"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I think the cop wants to kick my ass he was REALLY pissed off and was cursing, pushing me etc. Wish me luck! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
