<br>
So, could you confirm that you are Candie as well?<br>
Would you care to comment on the allegation you cast Annul Magic in an act of revenge against a previous Shenmerlan KS against another of your characters?<br>
<br>
If you are both Candie &amp; Sandidara, would you mind posting your version of the events?  Such as:<br>
1. Who was in your group.<br>
2. Who came to help afterwards.<br>
3. The sequence &amp; type of spells cast from yourself or your party on Lodi.<br>
4. Aggro target changes on Lodizal during combat you noticed.<br>
5. Any logs or screenshots you care to submit to public viewing? <br>
6. Whatever other details about the whole event (maybe about the other group containing Shenmerlan) you feel are pertinent.<br>
<br>
No need to respond to Shenmerlan's allegations (as you did somewhat already), but merely stating the facts surrounding the Lodizal kill from your perspective.<br>
<br>
Also, what (if any) GM interaction took place after the fact?<br>
<br>
I'd really like to hear your full side of the story.<br>
<br>
Take care, <p><select name=Frekkels>

im sure if these events transpired just the way shen had described them he'd have some screen shots or logs to show where she had annuled the mob. or at least id hope he will remember to next time, if this indeed happened that way<br>

I.E see them in trouble and watch them die.. dont give ports etc...But it is true 2 wrongs do not make a right, and i would not KS a rare spawn using annul magic to get the group killed.. some of which are innocents.  <p><center>

Unfortunately I turned them on AFTER Candie started annuling Lodizal and I think after the fight.  I wish I would have took some screenshots of her because you could see the annul magic animations on her and lodizal easily even though she was trying to hide behind lodizal.  I will know better next time, but I hope there isn't a next time.  I've never needed to log stuff before, so I wasn't prepared.  The first time she accused me of KS'ng her I was called in to help Docrx and Greywulfe but I wasn't even in the group during the kill.  I had arrived a few minutes after the start (admitted by someone in her group) of the fight and I didn't know it was a KS situation.  I apologized for it and said it wouldn't happen again, but I guess she (Sandidara) won't let it go.  It really sucks that Sandidara / Candie made us fight to get our mob back when we had lodizal so close to being killed.  It just made some latecomers mad and made me look bad (again), but I feel that Lodizal was rightfully ours.  There would have been no problem at all if it wasn't for Sandidara / Candie's actions.   She admitted in a previous message that we had Lodizal cleanly and without dispute, so it should be obvious that she is the troublemaker in this case.  She and her friends are the only ones who have ever blamed me for kill stealing or causing any trouble.<br>
<br>
Here is what I have for a log:<br>

How many eyepatches and shells can each of you *really* equip?  Thought those were Lore. <br>
<br>
While I will never condone KSing  &lt;if that is what happened&gt;, I also find it very hard to feel too sorry for someone *almost* losing out on the 13th attempt to hog a quest mob.<br>

go pharm something else to allow others the chance at loot or the quest it uses..or is KS'n your group of 12+ times the only way for others to get your perma camped spawn?<br>

I can't speak for the others in the group.  But I like to help others get stuff, I am not ruled by greed.   Out of those 12 times, I have not always got items.  Most of the time others have needed, so they got priority.  It is not always the same four of us fighting Lodizal either.  Why do you always assume negative motives?<br>
<br>
I only sold one belt I got to buy some spells and gear so far.  I was hoping to win the roll on another item to be able to buy a horse.  Is that so greedy?  I think not, but your intitled to your own opinion.  Remember, I'm just a normal level 55 wizard, not some big monster.<br>
<br>
Do you board trollers just look for things to complain about and put other people down?  It is sad that you are so fixated on the negative.  It is simply amazing the amount of effort some of you put towards trying to hurt others.<br>
<br>
Now go ahead and rip this post apart too so you can keep your drama lifestyle up and continue to push others down and feel like your better than them.<br>

&quot;Candie admitted to trying to ruin the lodizal kill for us. She spoke like it was revenge thing, although she had no balls to admit who she was connected to. &quot;<br>
<br>
The link below has our entire conversation.  Yes people that is the ENTIRE conversation with Shenmerlan, where he is supposed to have gotten his information for the above quote.<br>
<br>
Oh and remember you saying something about being falsly accused of KSing Lodi?  I mean previous to this night where I sat and watched you KS Merlian and his group.  If your falsly accused why do you keep admitting it to everyone?<br>

Slow has to be cured and since you cant cast benificial spells on a mob the is not a pet there is no way to remove turgur's ( that the level 51 shaman slow in case you didnt know Sancta). I will assume Ghie and Evelle both understood this since they have grouped with me almost every day for the last few years.<br>

I didn't.  I knew we could rez back and finish lodizal off.  I didn't doctor any log because I didn't turn it on until after my conversation with Candie had already started.   Nice that you posted the part of the log with all the complaining about the take back of our kill and have none of the rest.  I am not trying to hide anything about what happened.  I kinda like my talk with Candie, she certainly deserved it.  I didn't KS Merlian or the others, they weren't even in the zone when we started attacking lodizal.  They should of left lodizal to us since we were first to engage.  I didn't ask for his help and he was just being a scavenger.  I'm sure he was just trying to kill it in hopes of loot anyway like the others.  I was trying to get someone in the zone to admit to who Candie was, since Candie is such a wimp that she didn't respond to me until AFTER lodizal was killed.  None of the problems that occured during this lodizal kill would have happened if it wasn't for CANDIE.  pure and simple.  Two wrongs don't make a right.  Didn't your mom ever teach you that?<br>
<br>
Docrx and I didn't need any help with Lodizal then or now and for all I knew Merlian and others are her friends that she called in to steal lodizal from us.  I don't mind competition normally, but underhanded tactics and hypocrits make me mad.  By her posts you think she was above all this KS stuff, but obviously not.  She seems well aware of all the cheater tactics.<br>
<br>
You seem to love to create trouble for other people.  Is that why your not in Midnight Fury anymore?  I wonder.<br>
<br>
What's great about this whole thing?  That we got the kill both times that involved this troublemaker and no amount of sabotage attempts, lies, or lame flame board manipulations is going to change that.  So sorry Sand/candie, you lose anyways.<br>
<br>
Better luck next time and I know there will be since you seem to be camping Lodizal too.  That's why you were in iceclad on the gnoll huts isn't it.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Now that I know what to expect, I've got some treats in store for you.

Be it purposely to omit certain things or not, but here is what proves that they were.<br>
<br>
<br>
[Sun Oct 13 23:22:41 2002] It will take about 25 more seconds to prepare your camp.<br>
<br>
<br>
and then here..<br>
<br>
[Sun Oct 13 23:25:31 2002] You begin casting Familiar.<br>
<br>
<br>
and in no where in between is there a message of you abandoning your camp. Im not a professional or anything, but im pretty certain that in order to cast, you would need to abandon your camp at some point.<br>
<br>
Like I said earlier, be it purposely to omit certain conversations that took place to protect the identity of whomever, or for whatever reason ...(i really dont care as it didnt involve me...and the fact i must be bored to read all this s.hit)<br>
<br>
but to say :<br>

<br>
What this amounts to is yes someone sent me a tell that Lodi was up in Ice Clad.  I went to check it out, told people not to come it was the KSing bastards.  Oh yes those were my words.<br>
<br>
So what it all comes down to is you while running your 4 ebayed accounts (notice that Docrx never posts to defend himself) were not timing your slows or didn't have the mana for them.  You could not finish off an unslowed Lodizal and lost.  <br>
<br>
Oh yes your suspisions are correct I was laughting my ass off when you died.  Bruise to the ole ego wasn't it mighty Lodizal hunter?  So your ego that you are superior at killing Lodizal got you killed and then it got bruised when it was witnessed.<br>
<br>
&quot;What's great about this whole thing? That we got the kill both times&quot;<br>
Yeah you couldn't handle it on your own and so you wait until someone else had mega agro the second time around.  Oh yeah I was sitting on top of the gnoll huts watching that too.  I saw you chain casting.  Only regret I have is that I didn't train dervs on you so you couldn't ks the innocent people.<br>
<br>
&quot;I feel we had the rights to him since we got him down to 1/8 - 1/4 bub.&quot; <br>
If you lack the power to finish him off it's all horse shoes and hand granades.  Close doesn't count.<br>
<br>
&quot;[Sun Oct 13 22:57:35 2002] You told Charisse, 'no, we were able to come back, rez and barely kill it with a bunch of others all attacking at the same time.'&quot;<br>
Your own words wether they were real in game or not I dont know but you posted this here for all to see.  So you say you dont need help to kill Lodizal?<br>
<br>
&quot;I don't mind competition normally&quot;<br>
You have yet to explain how letting another group take agro  then chain nuking so you dont get summoned and killed so you can walk away with the loot is competition.<br>
<br>
&quot;That's why you were in iceclad on the gnoll huts isn't it. &quot;<br>
So which is it?  I was KSing your group of 4 that have had 12 Lodi kills with my 53 druid or watching you KS yet again?  (oh yeah i'm buying that load of bull.. i'll believe you've KSd 12 times)<br>
<br>
&quot;Nice that you posted the part of the log with all the complaining about the take back of our kill and have none of the rest.&quot;<br>
Maybe you should try reading posts before trying to make replies.  It might help you to stick with one story which you have yet to do.  I posted the entire conversation I had with you.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;I've got some treats in store for you. I now look forward to smacking you down again.&quot;<br>
Yes you have KSd me and my friends once, but your wrong hoss it wont happen again.<br>

It is because you, Shenmerlan, are made of nothing but bullshit, and everyone can see that too.<br>
<br>
Oh and let your supposed guildmates and friends fight lodi themselves, IF in fact that's what you're really doing, and not selling the pieces.  Don't hold their hands and KS the mob for them.  If they're not high enough in level and/or don't have the cash, they can damn well wait their turn for lodi and kill him when they're prepared.  Otherwise let the other people that have worked hard for it and have the suffient levels kill him.  Oops, that may be too much to ask for though, huh.<br>
