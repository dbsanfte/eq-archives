&quot;This agreement will help to achieve a long-standing and vital American objective: an end to the threat of nuclear proliferation on the Korean peninsula.&quot;  Bill Clinton - 1994<br>
<br>
<br>
The U.S. and the world got blackmailed. We got blackmailed by a communist dictator who wanted $$$$. We knew it...they knew we knew it.. So the answer? Send in Jimmy Carter to aid N. Korea with their scheme.<br>
<br>
I cant help but to wonder how many times Bill Clinton was picked on by a bully in Jr. High / High school..And how many times he tried to figure out some angle to befriend the bully. This is often called appeasement. This is when you are too frightened to stand up and do the right thing...albeit the hard road...but nonetheless the right position to take: Defend yourself and those whom you are responsible for.<br>
<br>
Tom Delay, 98 : &quot;Since agreeing to help find the financing and necessary technology to build two nuclear reactors for North Korea in '94, the Clinton administration has done everything it can to give Americans the impression that it's diplomatic efforts have frozen and stopped North Korea's efforts to develop a nuclear arsenal.&quot;<br>
<br>
Now, in 2002, we wonder if our &quot;cowboy&quot; president, G.W. Bush, has the balls to confront N. Korea, OR if he is only talking tough with Iraq cause he wants oil. I whole-heartly agree!!  Lets wait and see how Bush handles N. Korea.. Once he does...and he will [do what is BEST for this nation and the world], we can COMPARE a conservative political mindset to that of a socialistic political mindset of appeasement.<br>
<br>
Clinton is not a fool for trying to find the best, least hostile negotiation to peace.... No... but he is a fool for trusting a WELL KNOWN lying communist dictator...and trying to appease him!<br>

They decide that to truly prove themselves a worthy presence in the world they need to do it by spending resources on their military industrial complex while ignoring the growing domestic troubles. Peace and treaties be damned! I wonder where they came up with that idea. <br>
<br>
Truth be known though. I don't like North Korea. In fact I dislike them so much that it pisses me off that all those treaties were with them were signed. Bill Clinton was blackmailed, not by North Korea though. He was blackmailed by a few greedy fookin' money whores who weren't content with eating up the resources of the free world they wanted in on the cheap labor of Asia. The world bank in its modern Thatcherite/Reaganite form is the biggest problem in how we deal with the rest of the world.<br>
<br>
Background: The world bank was started for noble reasons.The International Monetary Fund,  as devised by Keynes,  helped to rebuild the world post WW2. However, like all pieces of bureaucracy it didn't want to go away after its initial use was fullfilled. So then it became basically a world charity. We used it in the same way we did post war. We lent countries money if they would meet certain terms. This did wonders for increasing our influence. Then came Thatcherism. The idea that business was much more efficient than government. The more business got involved the less democratic conditions mattered in our conditions and the more economic ones mattered. This sounded good on paper, but like communism it reallied on the fact that the individual would give up personal gain for the good of the world. Unlike communism, the personnal gain came from those who were most successfull at that game.  Conditions used to be of the type where we demanded voting. Now the vast majority of them involve forcing favorable conditions for western business on them. The average amount in the 90s had bloomed to 111 conditions.  We've forced Brazil to privatize their electricity.   The examples seem mind blowing:<br>
<br>
 Argentina needs money for flood repairs we make them shut down their unions in factories that the west has interest in.<br>
<br>
We've forced Brazil to privatize their electricity.  Immediately French, English, and American owners swooped in and decided to make it more efficient.  They laid off 40 percent of the work force.  Then lights started going out.  Now residents of Rio get to pay double for half the service. <br>
<br>
The tag team of privatization and deregulation that is the backbone of Reaganomics/Thatcherism can be traced to include such world defining events as the political coup in Pakistan that lead to the rise in right wing religious faction that supported and was supported by the Taliban. The rise in AIDS in subsaharan Africa. The privatization and subsequent fragmentation of Russia's military industrial complex, that have us now wondering where all those extra armaments went.  The 167 conditions given to Equador to relieve their recession sent them further down hill, and chaos has reigned the streets ever since.  The only two countries to have come out after a World Bank loan ahead have been China and Botswana.  Why?  They ignored the World Bank's suggestions, despite threats of  war that from the West. The man who won the Noble Prize in Economics for devising this system (Professor Joseph Stiglitz)  has now become its biggest critic. <br>
<br>
Before I wonder too far off topic let me bring it back. How does this apply to North Korea. They asked for World Bank money. They were granted a loan. Their conditions didn't include guaranteeing votes or human rights. They were supposed to open markets to the west. When they refused the Euro-Ameriacan 21st century carpet baggers access and turned to China for aid they became a &quot;threatening nation&quot;. NOT because of  attrocities committed on their own people for decades.  NOT because they were posing a threat to South Korea, whom they had begun opening borders to. They became hostile because NIKE couldn't get more cheap shoes so they could pay Tiger Woods to wear their little swoosh while extolling the tribulations of being a part black part Asian golfer. <br>
<br>
Immediatley after G.W. named them amongst the terrible three. They began closing off further. They hadn't closed off form the West when we threw out all those Treaties some of which they had signed, but for some reason being considered an enemy in the world audience of the fiercest, strongest, most determined country in the world caused them to stop exchanges with their southern, U.S. supported, democratic sister-state.  They began increasing their troop presence along the DMZ border with S. Korea. Two Americans have since been shot while in this demilitarized zone.  <br>
<br>
Its not just Bush. To be fair the media paints a picture of the aforementioned Jimmy Carter, the rest of the World doesn't see.  America seems to have a naive love for dumb looking southerners for president, like Clinton and Bush.  Also like Clinton and Bush, Jimmy Carter comes off as a means-well good ol' boy, while pushing agendas of realpolitik that would make Niccolo Machiavelli cringe.  His diplomatic missions have dome squat for other countries while convincing them a brand new Western run and owned  factory will turn about their problems. The media loves this sh(i)t though. The coming together of business and government to help the third world. They press shows up to see the treaty signing, the handshake, and the groundbreaking. They never come back to see that Haiti's dictator has new tanks and the people have shitt literally in their water. <br>
<br>
So now we have a lot of countries who have done as we told them and embraced this trickle down form of economics, and while we discuss it on the internet they are climbing light poles to steal electricity.  The people revolt, but the U.S. government's complacent media paints the portrait as a political upheval, not an uprising of the people who don't want the paint factories dumping in their drinking water. So your tax dollars go to put shiny new weaponry around the power plants and factories in some good forsaken backwoods country, so a few people can rake in offshore untaxed cash and a few crazed dictators can get new weapons of terror to turn on their own people. The only problem is that these dictators eventually get sick of the constricting demands of the West and turn on us.  It isn't hard to make a crushed people rally behind a common enemy. (see Iraq for most media friendly example) <br>
<br>
 so a few people can rake in offshore untaxed cash... Ever wonder why campaign finance reform is a joke? Why is GW's coke use or Bill or Al's pot smoking more of an issue than Cheney's breaking of the trade sanctions in Iraq that we wouldn't let the Red Cross break to bring medicine in, or Al Gore, the eco-pol's bulldozing of a South American Indian tribe to get an oil well up?  <br>
... so a few people can rake in offshore untaxed cash...<br>
<br>
496 people control half the world's wealth.  I wonder if these people remember the French Revolution.  You know maybe its a good thing North Korea has nukes.  Maybe we will be forced to realize that NO weapons of mass destruction are good weapons of mass destruction.  A multilateral total annihilation of all weapons would allow us to face problems head on instead of letting some draft dodging chickenshyts hide behind a few brave men who they turn their backs on the minute they are no longer needed. (see governmental denial and subsequent ridicule of Gulf War Syndrome Vets).  argh getting to pissed off. Will quit here before I have to hire a publisher. Sorry if it was too long. Will leave some quotes after word to illustrate some points. <br>

&quot;Beware the leader who bangs the drums of war in order to whip the citizenry into a patriotic fervor, for patriotism is indeed a double-edged sword. It both emboldens the blood, just as it narrows the mind.... And when the drums of war have reached a fever pitch and the blood boils with hate and the mind has closed, the leader will have no need in seizing the rights of the citizenry. Rather, the citizenry, infused with fear and blinded with patriotism, will offer up all of their rights unto the leader, and gladly so. How do I know? For this is what I have done. And I am Caesar<br>
William Shakespeare<br>

Great information in your posts! I think it would take a thesis paper to answer them. LOL ;)<br>
<br>
I particularly like this quote"<br>
<br>
"I know not with what weapons World War III will be fought, but World War IV will be fought with sticks and stones."<br>

Well, I don't like what Einstein is getting at, but I think the quote will ring true if the US doesn't put the breaks on militarism. <p><HTML><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=417866" target="_blank" title="My junk listed on Magelo!"><IMG SRC="http://64.81.30.48/lurisig.jpg" HSPACE="150" WIDTH="330" HEIGHT="185" BORDER="0"></a></HTML></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showPrevMessage?topicID=329.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showNextMessage?topicID=329.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=329.topic&index=6><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/gfx/addReply1.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.emailToFriend?topicID=329.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.threadControl?topicID=329.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/deleteThreadFire.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=329.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=329.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub4.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="emarrmessageboardrules">Message Board Rules<option value="emarrgeneral">General<option value="emarrbazaar">Item Bazaar<option value="emarrdragonsandplanes">Rants and Flames<option value="emarrlinks">Links<option value="emarrroleplaying">Roleplaying<option value="emarrroleplayingoocforum">Roleplaying - OOC Forum<option value="emarrreallife">Real Life<option value="emarrupcomingmmorpgs">Upcoming MMOG's<option value="emarrothermmorpgs">Other MMOG's<option value="emarrscammeralert">Scammer Alert<option value="emarrsignaturecorner">Test Forum<option value="emarrscrollsnspells">Spell Bazaar<option value="emarrfrm13">Dragons and Planes<option value="emarrfrm14">Bargain Basement<option value="emarrfrm15">Shiny Things<option value="emarrfrm17">Funny Stuff<option value="emarrfrm18">America Under Attack<option value="emarrfrm19">Dark Age of Camelot<option value="emarrfrm20">Crafter's Hideout</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#E9D756>- </font><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/bemarr>Erollisi Marr, The Queen of Love</a><font color=#E9D756> - </font><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18>America Under Attack</a> <font color=#E9D756> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">Upgrade your account to ezSupporter...</a></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">...and never see another ad or pop-up again</a></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM AD SCRIPT -->
