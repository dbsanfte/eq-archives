Everyone but the leader Tormentcia, that is. I made a post on the atof website today, planning to just let them know about what happened, but she deleted it. A friend said I should just let it go and move on but I am thinking that if I try and move on and find another good guild, and that guild goes and asks her about me, she'd probably try and make accusations against me similar to those shown in the logs below, to hurt my chances, and that is not what I want to happen. I would rather go around being known as &quot;the guy who flames people when they really piss them off&quot; rather than &quot;the guy who stole a breastplate, according to the last guild he left&quot; More about the BP in the logs below. For the record I did not steal anything, Tormentcia is just getting a little stupid in her old age.<br>
<br>
anyways, here is what happened. When I joined atof, someone said I had a loot issue that concerned her. I asked the person about it and was ignored. Today during a guild meeting when loot was being talked about, I brought this up and torm said it concerned her too, but that I shouldn't worry about it. Someone else told me that she might mean that my past rants and flames posts concerned her, and not a loot issue, so I did what most people would do, I asked Tormentcia what concerned her, a loot issue or rants &amp; flames issue, and this is what happened.<br>
<br>
[Sun Nov 03 16:15:04 2002] You told tormentcia, 'when you said it concerned you too, did you mean my past posts on the emarr board?'<br>
[Sun Nov 03 16:15:13 2002] Tormentcia tells you, 'DROP IT'<br>
<br>
Now, I haven't had much contact with Torm since I joined atof in September. She has a temper and likes to snap at people, so I've just tried to avoid her. However, the few times I have asked her questions, she's blown up at me about it not being the right time, as if I can read her mind and know what she's doing at that moment. She's told me to &quot;drop it&quot; like she did today. She's run me around in circles with sarcastic replies meant to just get me to leave her be. The one thing that is the same every time is that in the end she just pretends I didn't ask her anything and doesn't give me an answer. Frankly I was sick of it happening to me and other people I know, so when she told me to DROP IT today, I /guildremoved myself. this prompted the following...<br>
<br>
[Sun Nov 03 16:17:26 2002] Tormentcia tells you, 'Real mature, seeya!'<br>
[Sun Nov 03 16:18:00 2002] You told Tormentcia, 'you're the one who never answers peoples questions. you give people the runaround and tell them to drop it every time they have a question to ask you'<br>
[Sun Nov 03 16:18:13 2002] Tormentcia tells you, 'You're @#%$ asking me a question in the middle of a @#%$ meeting'<br>
[Sun Nov 03 16:18:15 2002] Tormentcia tells you, 'Give me a break!'<br>
[Sun Nov 03 16:18:18 2002] You told Tormentcia, 'I love atof, but lately I have become sick of YOUR attitude towards your guildies'<br>
[Sun Nov 03 16:18:24 2002] Tormentcia tells you, 'Good, then get out.'<br>
[Sun Nov 03 16:18:41 2002] Tormentcia tells you, 'I'm rather sick of you being a loot whore - make sure you return your droppable loot to an officer.'<br>
[Sun Nov 03 16:19:13 2002] You told Tormentcia, 'seems there is NEVER an appropriate time to ask you a question that has a simple answer without you flipping out.'<br>
[Sun Nov 03 16:19:29 2002] Tormentcia tells you, 'Do you seriously think I'm just sittnig around doing nothign all the time? This is not my job and I am not here for your amusement'<br>
<br>
So, let's see a show of hands here. How many guild leaders out there think that answering your guildmembers questions is considered &quot;amusing&quot; them. And how many of you refuse to answer your guildmembers and treat them with a little respect cause it's not your job to &quot;amuse&quot; them? Torm is the first guild leader I have seen yet that feels this way. Most of them are there to try and run a successful guild, and part of that is, you know, interacting with your members and answering questions they might have, not ignoring them and treating them like sh|t.<br>
<br>
Now, for those who noticed, yes, she called me a &quot;Loot Whore&quot; above and told me to return all my droppable loot to an officer. I find this really amusing since right before I guildremoved myself, there was a discussion going on about calling people &quot;loot whores&quot; A Warrior showed interest in a Bow of Doom, but someone else felt that it was a ranger only weapon, and thus called the warrior a loot whore. Tormentcia and others said that was wrong, and Torm said she wanted to know who called him a loot whore. This was all cool until she called ME a loot whore. let's continue with my conversation with her...<br>
<br>
[Sun Nov 03 16:19:57 2002] You told Tormentcia, 'how am I a loot whore? I haven't received any loot while in atof, and none in AD either. you calling me a loot whore for no reason is rather stupid'<br>
[Sun Nov 03 16:20:15 2002] Tormentcia tells you, 'I will need your BP returned.'<br>
[Sun Nov 03 16:20:25 2002] You told Tormentcia, 'HAH, I BOUGHT my bp' Lookie here, it's a link to my WTB a Mrylokar's Breastplate for 45kpp thread on the emarr board, wow!<br>
[Sun Nov 03 16:20:38 2002] Tormentcia tells you, 'No, I gave that to you - I handed it to you when I was sitting in GD.'<br>
[Sun Nov 03 16:20:48 2002] You told Tormentcia, 'umm, no you didn't.'<br>
[Sun Nov 03 16:20:54 2002] Tormentcia tells you, 'But whatever, steal if you want'<br>
[Sun Nov 03 16:22:00 2002] You told Tormentcia, 'I can't believe you are actually accusing me of stealing something I bought with my own money'<br>
[Sun Nov 03 16:22:12 2002] Tormentcia tells you, 'I can't believe you're acting so 12'<br>
<br>
So she's accused me of stealing a Breastplate that I actually bought from Kelin who, if I recall, is an Enchanter. I made a post on the guild board, in the general section (since by the time I typed it out, torm had removed me from the members only section) about why I left, and when I went back to check a little while later, it was deleted. Being really pissed at this point, I went back in game and sent Tormentcia a tell...<br>
<br>
[Sun Nov 03 17:16:21 2002] You told tormentcia, 'how about atof replace that bard song, Dreams of Ayonae I donated while I was a probie'<br>
<br>
no reply<br>
<br>
[Sun Nov 03 18:10:42 2002] You told tormentcia, 'when do I get my song back?'<br>
<br>
nadda<br>
<br>
[Sun Nov 03 18:33:51 2002] You told tormentcia, 'why are you allowed to demand something be given to the guild, and then accuse me of stealing it when I tell you I bought it, but when I tell you I want my donated bard song back you sit there and ignore me? If you are really that stupid, the breastplate was bought from Kelin on the 25th of October. I posted on the emarr board on the 24th, he said he had one, I bought it, then updated my post on the 25th saying I just bought one'<br>
[Sun Nov 03 18:34:06 2002] Tormentcia tells you, 'Continue to send me tells and you will be reported for harassment'<br>
[Sun Nov 03 18:35:02 2002] Tormentcia tells you, 'What's really ironic is we were going to work on finding something to compensate you for the spell you DONATED. You know what donate means right?'<br>
[Sun Nov 03 18:35:06 2002] Tormentcia tells you, 'But after reading your post .. nah'<br>
[Sun Nov 03 18:36:16 2002] You told Tormentcia, 'I did donate it. but when you started telling me I STOLE a bp from you, I got pissed off. you want to be childish and accuse me of that, I can do the same thing and demand you give me something back for the spell too'<br>
[Sun Nov 03 18:36:39 2002] Tormentcia tells you, 'You have been reported, thank you'<br>
<br>
she tells me if I send her more tells she'll report me. then sends me 2 more tells, which I reply to, and she says I am reported. this is where I made a mistake and tried to send a tell to a friend but accidentally sent it to her instead.<br>
<br>
[Sun Nov 03 18:37:11 2002] You told Tormentcia, 'so I replied to that, and she said &quot;you have been reported, thank you&quot;'<br>
[Sun Nov 03 18:37:27 2002] Tormentcia tells you, 'Want to be reported again?'<br>
[Sun Nov 03 18:37:52 2002] You told Tormentcia, 'you are unbelievable, you really are'<br>
[Sun Nov 03 18:38:06 2002] Tormentcia tells you, 'Reported again, thank you'<br>
<br>
I donated that song to the guild, and I never ever asked for anything in return, even thought it was a song I could have sold for 20kpp or more and could have used the money. But she wanted to be stupid and tell me I had to give back a bought breastplate and accuse me of stealing it when I refused, I could be just as stupid and demand that she give me back a song I DONATED to the guild.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/bemarr.showUserPublicProfile?gid=igota>Igota</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 1642<br> <font color=#E9D756>(11/3/02 5:05:19 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3774.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Tormentcia, guild leader of a Twist of Fate.</span><hr size=1> I did not read anything past about the first line of your post, but haveing had more then my fair share of dealings with Twhorementicia, I am willing to bet you are right.<br>

The funny part is that she reported you for responding to her question. Had I been the GM to respond to that I would have ripped her a new one for abusing the /report command. <br>

It's a shame because there are some really cool people in that guild that would walk through hell for me and I for them.<br>

<br>
I agree with Araya on the aToF thing, I have a bunch of good friend's that went to that guild, but her and the fact that they did guild some mega losers pushed me FAR FAR away as well. Not that I am complaining, I had a great time where I was. <p><BR><BR>
