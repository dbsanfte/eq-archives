<br>
Are you referring to the Spanish inquisition?  I hope not.  Martin Luther posted his 95 Theses in 1517.<br>
<br>
Pope Gregory IX instituted the papal inquisition in 1231.  Not sure on that date, but around there.<br>
<br>
Pope Sixtus IV insituted the Spanish inquisition is 1378.<br>
<br>
Those were the two major inquisitions.  If you're talking about the Roman Inquisition of 1542, well, ok then.  <br>
<br>

Ask for reperations all you like.  but the answer you will probably get is 'We saved your ancestor's souls.  Would you like yours saved as well?<br>

<br>
I interpreted Ghie's comments to mean reparations from the Roman Empire when they were throwing Christians to the lions and persecuting the religion around 1-250 A.D.  I'll let Ghie explain himself, but that's how I interpreted it.<br>
<br>
<br>
Raedwulf:<br>
<br>
I take offense at the use of the term redneck in the way it was used as well.  While I read your explanation about your intent when using it, it still came across as offensive to me.  Are only white people who get sunburned necks racist?  No.  Are white people who get sunburned necks found only in the South?  No.  Yet your statements and the words used suggest that by their everyday common usage.  Just because I live in Georgia and not New York City (thank God, I personally would hate it there), I am not an uneducated, backward ass redneck (and by implication a racist).<br>
<br>
As Ceru said, it is upsetting that the South is perceived as a hotbed of racism and *primitive/ignorant/insert derogatory term here* thinking.  Yes, the South has racism, yes everywhere in the world has racism.  I do find it funny that despite Southern racism supposedly being so overt and oppresive, every major race riot since the 60's when overt racism practices were ended, where people were injured by each other (not riot police), has occurred in big cities like L.A., Detroit, etc.  Food for thought.<br>
<br>
<br>
About reparations:<br>
<br>
The truly sad thing about the reparations discussion is who is being victimized in its name.  There have been a few brave reports on the fraud that is being perpetuated on black people by other black people using this issue.  I say brave because it seems the media is often too paralyzed from fears of being perceived as racist to even report on the activities of racial interest groups.<br>
<br>
While there are some legitimate attempts to seek reparations, all too often donations are gathered by black racists asking for money to fight the white devil and &quot;get people paid.&quot;<br>
<br>
When these same people are questioned about the money and what activities they have participated in to further the reparations movement, the answer is &quot;no comment&quot;, and the tax records show  .... you guessed it: $0 contributions.  <br>
<br>
In other words, it is just like donating money to supposedly feed starving children (or some other noble sounding charity) and finding out the solicitor just pocketed your money.  Obviously I am diametrically opposed to the idea of slavery reparations, but I dislike people using any agenda people believe in to personally profit from it.<br>
<br>
And the victims of this fraud are most often unsophisticated, poor black people who are told they *will* get money for this.  That the money is already allocated, etc.  These people deserve the most protection from these racial predators and their disgusting practices, and yet authorities and media seem paralyzed with how to deal with it.  I have no solution, but I find it sad. <p>Impresario Wyvern Wyrmsong <br>

I understand the connotations and denotations of <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> redneck</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.<br>
<br>
The irony of it is that the word is a bigot's term.<br>
<br>
It is a derogatory term used to alienate and delineate a group of people for perceived and assumed differences that are based purely on stereotypical generalizations.<br>
<br>
Are bigoted black people rednecks?  No. They're bigoted black people.<br>
.................chinese people? No. No. They're bigoted Chinese people.<br>
<br>
Only bigoted white people are <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> rednecks</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.<br>
<br>
Rednecks, in both denotation and connotation, are white people of lower socio-economic standing with sub par educations that are generally known to have vocal opinions about race divisions and local community pride.<br>
<br>
Now here is the kicker.<br>
<br>
Can we give bigoted black people a derogatory term? <br>
No, because that would be racist.<br>
<br>
To end racism you must well.. uh.. stop being racist.  <br>
That goes for all sides.<br>
<br>
Double standards are alive and well.<br>
<br>
Ceru<br>
<br>
PS - Simply put.  Institutions like the Klan are dying or dead - they've been marginalized not necessarily for their views but for their tactics (violence).  The racism of today is a much more pervasive and sublime force.  You have to work hard and be careful who you lump together - trying very hard not to.  Mistakenly (or not so mistakenly) lumping folks together will only work to alienate those that might on other terms be sympathetic to your cause. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uflubman.showPublicProfile?language=EN>FlubMan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 62<br> <font color=#E9D756>(8/28/02 8:42:22 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3586.topic&index=27>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Stupid @#%$ racist reparation jerkoffs</span><hr size=1> I am just glad to know that I am not the only one who found the term redneck to be derogatory. <p>Flubbin<br>

<br>
In any event, I used the term and those others to describe a certain environment where the type of historical blinders demonstrated by Tovectris could develop.  Whether that be White Supremacist, Klan (is that better?) or Holocaust Deniers, the point was that the &quot;history&quot; he cited was both ridiculously in error and a fantasy.  And that fantasy is offered by those that want to have some reason to claim that blacks are inferior because they are still worse off economically and politically than other groups in the US after 140 years of equality (despite the obvious falsity to that claim).<br>
<br>
I'm disappointed that fewer folks didn't slam Tovectris for his hatefilled bile he spewed around here.  Sure, his conclusion was correct that reparations are stupid, but that doesn't justify the &quot;reasoning&quot; he used to get there. <p>-- The <select><option>SOB</option><option>Grump</option><option>Bastard</option><option>pwner of Chiteng</option></select> formerly known as Raedwulf</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uflubman.showPublicProfile?language=EN>FlubMan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 63<br> <font color=#E9D756>(8/28/02 9:29:54 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3586.topic&index=30>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Stupid @#%$ racist reparation jerkoffs</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> I had no idea so many people were touchy about the term &quot;redneck.&quot; I didn't think anything that was such a pervasive joke (Foxworthy and others) could be so sore.

I believe you have missed the whole point. Yes, Foxworthy using the term in a joke is ok. BECOUSE HE IS ONE!! Just in the same way that Chris Rock, Martin Lawrence, and others use the &quot;N&quot; word in their jokes. And no I am not calling them the &quot;N&quot; word, merely pointing out that becouse of one's race it's ok to use certain words in jokes. I personally am not offended to be called one. I am offended that people don't think it is a derogatory term. <br>

People aren't touchy about it in large measure because of the paradigms of the modern American culture.<br>
<br>
I'm not touchy about it, really.  But I'll call anyone on the floor that attacks racism with racism.<br>
<br>
Tovectris (sp?) is so absurd.  Why attack something that will burn itself out.  Stupidity is stupidity and most will see it for that.  It's the subtle, less obvious things that are more damaging in the long run.<br>
<br>
Just as using the <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> N word</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> (hell, can't even spell it out without being labeled or misunderstood) creates an atmosphere of oppression and anger.<br>
<br>
Why don't you replace <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> redneck</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> with [/i]poor white trash[/i].  Somehow these are popularly used but don't think for an instant that they don't have harmful effects.  They create a line, just like the word above.  The difference is that the harm done is in perceptions of those outside - and how they prejudge those that are cursed with this title.<br>

I say African American because I view the sweatshops of America as a smaller form of slavery. <br>
    You are right, however, about them not being considered &quot;equal&quot; until around 40 years ago. So, if they are going to be able to sue for something, it should be within the 40 year range because One: This is coming up on the time when they were actually alive to be &quot;opressed&quot; and Two: coming up on 8 generations of &quot;freed&quot; blacks suing is a complete and utter shitty attempt at a free ride. This limits them to use the excuses of not being able to vote, not being able to get equal &quot;job oppurtunities&quot; (which I think we're MORE than making up for now days), and POSSIBLY, them not being able to get a normal education. With all this in mind, I think that women in America have more of a right to sue than the &quot;African Americans&quot; do.<br>
<br>
And no I would not support women trying to sue in a similar fashion.<br>

I live in LA (Los Angeles this time, not Louisiana) and have a neighbor that decided it was a good idea to put a 30 foot mobile home trailer in his front yard.  When Parking Enforcement showed up and forced him to move it (I am trying to sell my house after all), he was stunned that anyone would complain and that it was against the law.<br>

Noone has even mentioned the fact that alot of tribes in Africa sold their own people. Or the prisoners they got from warring with other tribes. Not to mention the BILLIONS of dollars that America and Europe have poured into Africa. Or even the fact that even today, some leaders in Africa are still selling people into slavery, robbing their people of food, and even genocide.  <p>Flubbin<br>
