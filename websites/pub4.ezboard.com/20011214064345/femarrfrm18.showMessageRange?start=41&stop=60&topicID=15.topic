I don't think you can &quot;deter terrorism&quot; by bombing/ having an air campaign in Afghanistan, you have to occupy the land, and the teritory, and fish the suckers out. Afghanistan has been in a civil war for 22 years (I beleive), wiht very limited infrastructure and resources - after 22 years of civil war, not much is left. Heck, it's been said on CNN that alot of the country is even without power.<br>
<br>
Further complications arise from the fact that little is known about Afghanistan - there hasn't been a US embassy in the country since 1989. Furthermore, being entirely landlocked, as of now, there are no places for US to house there attack.<br>
<br>
Anyways, my opinions on some of the complications the US has to deal with.<br>

  Ablazen, in reguards to your comments on Fundamentalist Islamics in Afganistan you and I seem to disagree on the power of one person. In my eyes Mankind WHEN ALONE(one person) is weak and vunerable. Lets face it people don't want responsibility, they don't want alot of decesions, all they want is bread. Mankind gains power in groups, we are SOCIAL animals who need others. Note: my unpopular comment that aishen flamed me on &quot;man fears true freedom of expression! BAAAAA!&quot;.<br>
<br>
 My point to this insane rant? When you isolate these Islamic fundamentalists from their fellow comrads in arms, you remove them from their food, their water, their sense of security, you can break them. In the near future you are going to see not only military but Psychological warfare taking place in Afganistan. To see these baddies broken like a wild horse is going to bring a grin from ear to ear on my face. -Mec <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/udydezhomicydez.showPublicProfile?language=EN>DydezHomicydez</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 54<br> <font color=#E9D756>(9/16/01 9:52:44 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> i</span><hr size=1> i do agree about the social animal stuff, but i don't see how that really applies to this situation, i mean what do you propose we do to them. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/utanacite.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tanacite</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 22<br> <font color=#E9D756>(9/17/01 3:37:20 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Taliban revenge?</span><hr size=1> The Taliban will react or do what they need to do...so does the US.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/umuzaak.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Muzaak</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_lightning.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 21<br> <font color=#E9D756>(9/17/01 4:14:59 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Taliban revenge?</span><hr size=1> There are 15,000 rebels in Afghanistan offering to support a US strike. The rebels control a fraction of the north large enough to establish a base and launch strikes from there. How's that for positioning? =) Once we have tossed out the Taliban the rebel government (which is the only recongnized government of Afghanistan) will be more than happy to rule the country.<br>
<br>
I have read some predicting that this war will take years. Do not predict what will happen to NATO troops based upon what happened to the former Soviet Union. During the 1980's the USSR was POOR. The government had no hard currency to speak of so couldn't finance their efforts against Afghanistan. The USSR pulled out only because of the decaying infrastructure in the mother land. The USA and her NATO allies are well equiped and have the resources to move into Afghanistan and move in quickly. The USA has a proven track record that when the chips are down they can turn it around. (Remember Pearl Harbor!)<br>
<br>
If there is a war in Afghanistan it should not be compared with Vietnam for many reasons. <br>
<br>
1) A war in Afghanistan would not be based on ideology. It would not be a fight against &quot;communism&quot;. Communism has never been seen as a &quot;threat&quot; by the USA in and of itself. That is why we still have a small communist movement in the USA today. When we go to Afghanistan we will have the face of Osama bin Ladan burned into our memories. It will be his face the troops see as the tanks roll in and the bombs drop. This is much the same as WW2 when our forces had the faces of Hitler, Tojo, and Musalini (sp?) before them as they entered battle. In short the enemy is *real*.<br>
<br>
2) The war in Vietnam never had popular support. Know one understood why we were there. There is large popular support in the USA to go and kill Osama bin Laden and his cohorts including throwing down the government that hosts his terrorist organization.<br>
<br>
Finally, 3) the USA is very much aware of Guerrilla warfare. We used it against the British when fighting for independence, it was used in our Civil War and by our specialized forces during WW2, Korea, and Vietnam. Needless to say we are much better at it than the Afghanistanis. We have quick assault capabilities second to none in our military that capitalizes on the stealth of guerrilla tactics. It should be noted that population of Afghanistan, while it deeply hates the USA, also hates the Taliban which is an oppressive regime. The Taliban is popular amongst only the most radical of the Right. Be sure that we will see their troops running and surrendering as we did with Sadam's troops in Iraq.<br>
<br>
Taliban revenge? Who really cares... the USA is in this for the duration.

Some of the TALIBAN are not indiginous Afganies anyway.  Mongols are known in history as supporting their friends and effectively eliminating their adversaries, no questions ask.  That should clear things up well.  How about arming the resistance fighters against the TALIBAN and replacing them with a more tolerant regime.  Anyway, the TALIBAN arent supermen.

<br>
I tend to disagree. Of course &quot;one&quot; man alone is weak. But compare Bin Laden's army 5 years ago (about 2,000), to his current army of probably 40-50,000 (or so i hear on CNN) - it shows what 1 person can do through influential means.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> There are 15,000 rebels in Afghanistan offering to support a US strike</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Sounds good, but unfortunately, there are over 45,000 Taliban who support Bin Laden, who have been armed, trained, and equiped by the CIA in the 1980's. <br>
<br>
Furthermore, if these 15,000 were that big of a threat to the Taliban, they wouldn't of been forced out of Kabul, and the Taliban wouldn't be in power.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> It will be his face the troops see as the tanks roll in and the bombs drop. This is much the same as WW2 when our forces had the faces of Hitler, Tojo, and Musalini (sp?) before them as they entered battle. In short the enemy is *real*.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
I think one of the main problems arrise is the fact that if Bin Laden is killed, there's gonna be someone probably about 10x worse ready and willling to replace him.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> the USA is very much aware of Guerrilla warfare</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
If you are trying to imply that the US/Nato would have a military advantage going into afghanistan, i think you are deeply mistaken. There is little to bomb, almost no infrastructure - the terrain is very foreign to NATO.<br>
<br>
Furthermore, basic military strategy tells us that the person defending the land has a considerable advantage to those invading. The situation in Afghanistan is very different then dessert storm.<br>

<br>
An all out land assault on Afghanistan would be a disaster and carpet bombing would only serve to massacre innocent people.  You'll never get the Taliban soldiers, only the innocent Afghanis they use as a human shield; they will make sure of that.<br>
<br>
There are no easy answers here.  The experience of the former Soviet Union is VERY relavent to this situation.  Afghanistan is incredibly difficult to assault AND, our target is not Afghanistan, but rather the Taliban regime which, perhaps, has chosen to ally itself with the islamic extremists. We also must take GREAT caution that our actions do not touch off a revolt in Pakistan.<br>
<br>
In addition, we would need a staging area for massive a fullscale invasion and we simply do not have one.  India does not border Afganistan and the nations that due are not exactly anxious to drag themselves into an unwinable land war.<br>
<br>
The good news (as it were) is that our government and military leaders know this VERY well (far better than us) and don't appear to be planning this type of conflict.<br>
<br>
That is why Bush is prepping everyone for a &quot;long, drawn out conflict&quot; and a &quot;new kind of war&quot;.  Basically, what he is saying is that this isn't going to be WWII, Vietnam or Desert Storm (thank God).  This is going to be urban, tactical, warfare mercenary style and it's going to be ugly.  Civilian casualties are, I think, inevitable but (and I pray for this) will hopefully be kept to an absolute minimum.  I say they are inevitable because I fully believe that the Taliban will use innocent civilians as &quot;human shields&quot; for their installations.  It is a tactic that has been used before; unfortunately, the depths of evil in the human soul know no bounds.<br>
<br>
This &quot;war&quot; will need to be more of an international police action similar to the &quot;war&quot; on drugs but, hopefully, far more effective.  It is clear that the terror regimes will keep upping the ante and one can only assume that the next attack will be biological or chemical and result in a million+ casualties.  The time to act is now, without a doubt, but it will take subtelty, intelligence, diligence and cooperation - NOT brute force... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/udunkk.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dunkk</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 5<br> <font color=#E9D756>(9/19/01 9:04:32 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Taliban vows revenge if US strikes</span><hr size=1> I don't think that there will BE any Taliban left to enact revenge upon anyone. <br>

<br>
How so?? Should we sit at home and do nothing?? Then we're the cowards that they're trying to say we are.  We haven't agreed with and/or liked them for years but were willing to leave them alone.  THEY opened the &quot;can of whoopass&quot; by attacking our shores.<br>
<br>
I have no illusions that this is going to be easy.  But look around.  For the first time since perhaps WWII, the nation is united and willing to do whatever it takes to put an end to this sort of cowardly attacks on innocents.  The countries that are being referred to here are no longer innocents.  Pakistan and Afghanistan both pleaded the next day to be left alone.  BECAUSE THEY KNEW.<br>
<br>
Ya know, I'm sitting here listening to Lee Greenwood, and every time it starts over, there really is a sense of pride that fills me.  This is our country and they DARED to come inside our borders and wreak havoc.<br>
<br>
Now, if they're smart, they're sitting in their homes (or whatever) wondering when the retaliation is going to happen.  Not IF.  As Americans, we care deeply about justice.  And justice means making sure we get the right people.<br>
<br>
So how is this not heroic?? All the people who are outraged at what has happened.  Is it a matter of people having to get out their guns and look someone in the eye as they pull the trigger?? Is that what you're having a problem with?  I certainly don't.  Put the person that caused this in front of me and I would gladly pull that trigger to keep my children safe.  And never have a second thought about it.  Because it's NECESSARY to weed out the mad dogs.  This is a sort of rabies that needs to be cut out and disposed of and the only innoculation available for this type of &quot;rabies&quot; is a gun.  Agree or disagree, that's your right.  Because of where we live you have that right.  Or at least, where I live.  I love my country and Old Glory means something to me.  The only thing in my world that outranks my country, is my family.  In this instance I believe to protect the one, we have to protect the other.<br>

<br>
And saying these things in posts where you are arguing with someone else's perpesctive on things, proving how as much as every TV and radio station and politician ays &quot;we are more united than ever&quot;, your coming here to argue every little point one person makes just proves to me the &quot;United&quot; that everyone claims is more propaganda, made to stir up everyone into war-mode.<br>
<br>
We are &quot;United&quot; in the sense that we are angry and upset at what happened and feel &quot;something&quot; should be done.  As to what that something is, there is no unity there, so let it go.<br>
<br>
I have read more opinions on how this situation should be handled, some I agree with, some I disagree with, though most fall into the grey area where I agree somewhat and disagree somewhat.  But I really don't want anyone thinking they speak for me because they believe this propaganda that we are &quot;united&quot; in what we feel must be done about this.  We united in our concern for others to help them as best we could.  Now that you want to discuss the &quot;war&quot; or &quot;retaliation&quot;, you need to look no further than this message board to see the spectrum of views that are out there.<br>
<br>
Now to just point out some of the things I keep seeing that makes me ill:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> ***I have no illusions of war being a heroic undertaking***<br>
<br>
How so?? Should we sit at home and do nothing??<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Why do people feel the need to assume what someone else is thinking?  This person said war is not heroic, that does not mean &quot;we should do nothing&quot;.  Try understanding rather than assuming for once.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Then we're the cowards that they're trying to say we are. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I hate to point this out to you, but they never said we were cowards.  In fact it is widely believed these attacks were a response to our bravely getting involved in other country's wars.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> We haven't agreed with and/or liked them for years but were willing to leave them alone. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Willingness to leave them alone is probably more related to what happened than them thinking of us as cowards.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> THEY opened the &quot;can of whoopass&quot; by attacking our shores.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Yes, they knew exactly what they were doing, and by us responding the way they expect us to will simply make us pawns in their game.  I realize you don't see it this way, I only hope time will prove me wrong.  I am sure the terrorist group said &quot;Let's destroy thousands of American lives, their WTC etc. and they will not attack us because that has been how they reacted to these things in the past (i.e. Pearl Harbor).  Yes, they will just sit there like cowards and let us continue terrorizing their nation.&quot;<br>
<br>
For some reason I doubt these thoughts were in their minds.  More like,  &quot;If we attack this and that we will FORCE them to go to war with us, they have ignored what we have done in the past, lets do something they cannot ignore and will go to war over.&quot;  Although this may not be the wisest thing to think in our minds, it is probably closer to what they were thinking.  And I hate to even have to ponder what they thought, it does sicken me.<br>
<br>
And for what it is worth, just as righteous you claim to be, THEY claim WE opened a &quot;can of WHOOPASS&quot; by interfering with their wars.  I am not condoning what they did, nor rationalizing it, just showing you that you are now thinking like THEM, carry on.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> I have no illusions that this is going to be easy. But look around. For the first time since perhaps WWII, the nation is united and willing to do whatever it takes to put an end to this sort of cowardly attacks on innocents.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
See above.  The NATION as you say is NOT willing to do &quot;whatever it takes&quot; to put an end to this.  A select few are willing to do &quot;whatever it takes&quot;, especially since some of us are intelligent enough to know you will not put an END to this regardless of how many people you kill.<br>
<br>
And in regards to &quot;whatever it takes&quot;, are they willing to kill more innocent Americans to this end?  Are they willing to assume every person in the world is a &quot;possible&quot; terrorist until proven otherwise?  Think about what you are saying.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> The countries that are being referred to here are no longer innocents. Pakistan and Afghanistan both pleaded the next day to be left alone. BECAUSE THEY KNEW.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I did not realize you were the judge and jury to determine &quot;THEY KNEW&quot;.  Actually you reasoning here is the same reasoning the terrorists used.  Because the COUNTRY may be guilty of something (country as in government I assume), then all the people of that country are guilty?  That is what the terrorists assumed, they were mad at our government and decided the innocent people of this country were guilty too for living here and therefore killed them.  So, yes whoever is guilty of whatever, so be it.  But you, especially as a mother, cannot tell me that a 3 yearold child in Afghanistan is GUILTY of being a part of what happened.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Ya know, I'm sitting here listening to Lee Greenwood, and every time it starts over, there really is a sense of pride that fills me.

<br>
And of course, WE never dared to enter any other countries borders to wreak havoc. /sarcasm off<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Now, if they're smart, they're sitting in their homes (or whatever) wondering when the retaliation is going to happen. Not IF.

<br>
So let us give them what they wanted, a retalition.<br>
Yes, America is always about making sure we get the right people.  /sarcasm off<br>
I guess you choose to ignore all of the innocent people who have gone to prison or worse, as long as we are &quot;mostly&quot; correct. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> So how is this not heroic??<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
There is nothing heroic about killing innocent people no matter how you justify it.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> All the people who are outraged at what has happened.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Yes, lets appease all the outraged people by killing more innocent people so we can outrage more people, do you not see the downward spiral?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Is it a matter of people having to get out their guns and look someone in the eye as they pull the trigger?? Is that what you're having a problem with? I certainly don't.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Good to see you can take another life without a second thought.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  Put the person that caused this in front of me and I would gladly pull that trigger to keep my children safe.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Nice to see you think one person caused this, and that we can actually find that one person.  Regardless of that uncertainty, the people who caused this, mainly those who made the decision for it to ultimately happen are dead.  The people who could have &quot;NOT&quot; hijacked the planes are dead.  Anyone else who HELPED this happen, I am sure you will want as well, to what degree did they need to help.  Because if you think the Country of Afghanistan is guilty for harboring the terrorists, then why not consider our country guilty for &quot;causing&quot; this hatred toward us?  I mean, when do you stop pointing fingers at who caused this to come up with some rational ways of dealing with it?  I guess never, so go and  kill everyone that will make you feel safe.  If it will make you feel better.  You can kill every terrorist in the world and yopur children still won't be safe, so get over it.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> And never have a second thought about it. Because it's NECESSARY to weed out the mad dogs. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
And if you found out one of your children were one of the &quot;mad dogs&quot; would you feel the same way?  If you were Jeffrey Dahmer's mother, would you have killed your son?  I am curious about how you answer that.<br>
<br>

I think for now, mostly laugh.  Mostly.<br>
<br>
YOU'RE tired of people saying what they feel about this issue on a board that was set up for just that.  awwwwwww  I would suggest skipping this part of the board then.<br>
<br>
And as far as arguing other peoples perspectives, what the bloody hell do you think you did???<br>
<br>
Assuming ... LOL, a VERY dangerous thing to do.  I asked a question.  Look at it again.  And meant it as JUST THAT.  A question.  And if you re-read the thing, you might just see it that way, with &quot;arguements&quot; behind it voicing my opinion so as to give the original poster something to use to &quot;argue/debate&quot; his/her view.  I don't see where I &quot;assumed&quot; THEIR meaning, but you sure as hell did on mine.  Kinda the pot calling the kettle black there ain't it???<br>
<br>
ROFL, regarding &quot;cowards&quot;.  Apparently YOU weren't of voting age when Jimmy Carter was in the white house.  The whole world was joking about how americans &quot;talked loud and carried a small stick&quot;  (The movies about Sheriff Buford T. Pusser were real popular then ... look up a series called Walking Tall).  And as far as getting involved in &quot;other peoples wars&quot;, lemme clue ya, usually one side was an ally and ASKED for help.  And even those that weren't allies, had the right to ask for help.  Gee... lets see, a neighbor is getting mugged, you walk by when they call out for help?? Or you jump in and help if you're able??<br>
<br>
Ok, history lesson number one.  The Taliban is anti-anyone that's not muslim.  Period.  The muslim religion however, is a whole different ball of yarn.  The one has NOTHING to do with the other.  No more than catholicism has to do with feeding people to lions (yes, the romans weren't the only ones) or the inquisition.  In the name of God they killed, maimed and tortured.  These people are no more right than their predecessors.<br>
<br>
And what, pray tell, &quot;wars of theirs&quot; did we interfere with???  The Butcher of Baghdad??? Even the people were sickened by him.  Not to mention his neighbors.  Who, by the way, ARE allies of ours.  THEY went to the UN and asked for help.  And who did the UN point a finger at to go help??? Yup ... at the US.  Gee, go figure.  Athough, England, France and many others joined in.<br>
<br>
Again, you assume.  When I refer to &quot;country&quot; I refer to the powers controlling that country.  Very rarely are the people privy to what goes on among the &quot;ruling class&quot;  When I refer to Afghanistan, I'm referring to the Taliban.  They're the ones that dethroned the King there and are now ruling the country.  And Pakistan ... ugh, can't think of that old mans name now.  What gives you the right to decide that I said that the people were at fault??  Did I say murder innocents?? No ... you said I did though.  And I thought I watched too many John Wayne movies.  At what point in all that did you see me say that we should go over and steamroll the county till nothing was left??  Because that's what you inferred.<br>
<br>
How many &quot;innocent&quot; people do YOU know of in prison?? ROFL, ask em, they're ALL innocent!! And before you get theorhetical on me, the only way you get to answer that one, is if you've A) been there B) worked there C) worked with the people that are there in some capacity.  Cause I can claim two out of three of those options (&lt;G&gt; and A isn't one of them <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ~   ).  How bout you??  And being related to someone that falls under option A don't count.<br>
<br>
As far as the hijackers go, well, they get to answer to God.  By whatever name.  And are beyond any judgement on this planet.  Again, you play with the words to suit yourself.  Of course one person started this.  That's all it takes.  One person to get people thinking the way that one wants them to think.  Look at Charles Manson.  He did the same thing to a bunch of wannabe hippies that were disatisfied with the world.  And because of it, some real innocents were killed.  And if you don't think that Sharon Tates baby was an innocent by any stretch of the imagination, you need to see someone.  Want to go back farther?? How about Hitler.  An idiot housepainter that hated the Jews because a Jewish doctor couldn't save his mother.  He got a whole country to do things they (most of them) would never have done on their own.  But by the time they figured out they shouldn't be doing it, they were too afraid of their own government.<br>
<br>
Hmmm ... killing every terrorist in the world.  I think that's what the government has been talking about.  At least, that's what I keep seeing on the television.  And you are one twisted individual.  We're to blame for making them hate us? Because we're not muslim?? Well, gee ... I thought it was ok to be whatever you wanted here in the states.  Isn't that what started this country??  Well, partially anyway.<br>
<br>
Don't you worry your little head over my children.  They're hale and hearty and taught to think.  To question and to debate.  <br>
<br>
Bah! It's late and I've had enough of this.  All the things you accuse me of, you've done to me because I didn't agree with the way you thought.<br>
<br>
You can call me a cold hearted bitch if you want, but in regards to your last statement, if I thought for one second that my son was another Dahmer, it would be MY RESPONSIBILITY to not turn another such creature loose on the world.  Do I ever want to have to test that?  No, not if it can be helped.<br>

I think alot of people are wrong to compare this war to <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> any</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> past wars. Afghanistan - Russia, Vietnam - U.S. both the Afghans and the Vietnamese were being backed by global super powers. This is not the case in modern day Afghanistan. Additionally I don't think there will be any massive ground invasion, likewise I don't think there will be any sustained air campaign.<br>
<br>
Here is what I think will happen:<br>
<br>
Special operations troops, SAS, Delta Force, SEALs, etc will be dropped into Afghanistan. These highly trained soldiers will be self sufficient and will use guerilla warfare to fight guerilla warfare. (fighting guerilla warfare with conventional tactics is a lost cause) Specifically their mission will be to locate and kill Bin Laden, and Taliban leaders and to provide intelligence for tactical air strikes on key Taliban/Al Qaeda positions. Russian and American backed northern alliance Afghani troops will be used to take Kabul and set up what for all intents and purposes will be a puppet regime. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showMessageRange?topicID=15.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showMessageRange?topicID=15.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a> <b>3</b>  </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showMessage?topicID=205.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showMessage?topicID=203.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.emailToFriend?topicID=15.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.threadControl?topicID=15.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/deleteThreadFire.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=15.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=15.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub4.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="emarrmessageboardrules">Message Board Rules<option value="emarrlinks">Links<option value="emarrupcomingmmorpgs">Upcoming MMOG's<option value="emarrfrm16">The Emarr Quadrant<option value="emarrfrm18">America Under Attack<option value="emarrfrm19">Dark Age of Camelot<option value="emarrgeneral">General<option value="emarrfrm17">Funny Stuff<option value="emarrbazaar">Item Bazaar<option value="emarrscrollsnspells">Spell Bazaar<option value="emarrfrm15">Shiny Things<option value="emarrfrm14">Bargain Basement<option value="emarrdragonsandplanes">Rants and Flames<option value="emarrfrm13">Dragons and Planes<option value="emarrroleplaying">Roleplaying<option value="emarrroleplayingoocforum">Roleplaying - OOC Forum<option value="emarrscammeralert">Scammer Alert<option value="emarrsignaturecorner">Test Forum<option value="emarrreallife">Real Life<option value="emarrothermmorpgs">Other MMOG's</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#E9D756>- </font><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/bemarr>Erollisi Marr, The Queen of Love</a><font color=#E9D756> - </font><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18>America Under Attack</a> <font color=#E9D756> - </font><br><br> <br>
