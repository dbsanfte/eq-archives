Whatever happened in PoA Saturday is over time to move on.  Put the past behind.  I was afk through alot of it.  I wasn't in the group with leaders when they were talking, and I don't listen to heresay so my veiw or opinion of what happened would be, I'm sure, different.  As is everyone else's, because we're all just putting together bits and peices to come up with the whole picture.  Everyone is going to have a different perception of what happened.  That's natural.<br>
    When two people read the same book they each walk away with different ideas about it, but the one doesn't call the other a liar for comprehending the facts differently ( can you imagine if they did ).<br>
     Calling people liars for having a different perception is not fair.  I'm not saying LoF is right or Affliction, but different people see things differently and there's nothing wrong with that.  Let's not try to force each other to see it the way we see it ourselves or to believe what we ourselves believe.  After all variety is the spice of life.<br>
<br>
     How about we shake hands, makeup, and move on.<br>
<br>
<br>
    Had to say something all this your a liar,  no your a liar  I found rather insulting to my honor.  I am not a liar and I don't like being called a liar.  I'm sure others don't either.<br>
<br>
   After all a person is nothing without their word.<br>
<br>
    My apologies to any I may have offended.  Oh and last Rellic entry was submitted by Toran (sorry about the confusion). <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ubelgarbattlebiztch.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Belgar Battlebiztch</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 72<br> <font color=#E9D756>(9/30/01 12:10:11 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.lof.ukhq.co.uk/classmembers/belgar.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: What were you thinking Affliction?</span><hr size=1> I'm sorry you felt that way with the Naggy raid.  I see it a bit differently, aye.  LoF had cleared the Giants, had control of the area, and we had brought in, and we were bringing in friends/allies (we do have some of those that think we're fair), to clear Naggy for Rage to spawn.  This is where the phaat loot, and evil high lvls come in.<br>
Buff line<br>
lvl 60 Druid (omg fire &amp; magic resists, and Protection of the Glades...I love that spell)<br>
lvl 55 Enchanter (c2 and rune)<br>
lvl 54 Shaman  <br>
lvl 56 Cleric  (no raid or peridot fee)<br>
Bard to play mana song, a necro to &quot;Mana Feed&quot;, and a lower lvl shaman for crap buffs on her own.<br>
<br>
Naggy was going down; we hadn't read your post; we had no problem with your joining in; you joined in and saw naggy fall in what...less than five minutes.  He was total and absolute toast.  Oh, and those that died didn't have to worry about CR, Coffins, Lost exp.  High lvl clerics rezzed the few that had fallen. A lvl 60 druid won the crook, and a lvl 49 (non guild member), won a fiery bp of fenin ro...something like that.  Sorry my memory.  Had Blight dropped, I may have been interested in the roll....but then again, maybe not.  All who were in the fight were allowed to roll.<br>
<br>
My point being, is you may have been able to wipe out Naggy, but we had the area already, Yes?  You joined in and had a shot like everyone else did...yes?  We didn't stand over Naggy and say this is &quot;Guilds loot&quot; you can all go home now.  And Naggy fell like a green drake in RM.  Basically the same thing with Vox.  Her I had tried in lower lvls, and she treated me like /blush..../shudder..let's drop that one <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   We did join forces there, we buffed, we healed, and some guild won some loot.  Some of that is in contention, and I believe we did our best to make that one right....thought it was dropped...till now.<br>
<br>
We thought we were being fair, and getting what we wished as well.  Maybe I'm wrong.  That was the First Naggy raid I'd been on, and I couldn't participate...other than buff you up, run in pop off a heal, get booted to safe hall (bind spot), rinse repeat.<br>
<br>
Aye, we all see things different ways.  But I've also seen LoF members, when they screw up (and we do), Try to make it right.  As I said, apoligize, pay back, whatever the circumstances call for.  I'm ticked, that much is perfectly clear.  Especially when this [Bold] could [/Bold] have been handled in tells.  It's funny we wanted VS?  It was an option thrown on the table.  That way, nobody would lose to a &quot;Rush&quot; spawn (as is the practice).  The other stuff is angry frosting, thrown on a load of bull, to cover the sight and smell of what they did wrong.  Nobody know's this mysterious person that said, &quot;We're going to Hate&quot;.  10ish people were up in PoA...not 28 as one suggests.  But they HAD 2 to 3 more groups coming up...at the portal.  Come on here.  Tired of this one....a flippin simple &quot;Oops, I'm sorry&quot; would have sufficed (much more than the [Bold] STFU [/Bold] does), instead of the flame war going about now.<br>

Uhm I seem to recall this I never checked back on it after I let toran know. My understanding is that Toran found out about the raid and canceled ours as we never made an attempt on VS. I do not know what happened to VS from there. I also recall a good deal of confusion as to exactly who's turn it was in the rotation, but I digress simple fact is we never went for VS that spawn and I was told we let Siilver(spelling??) take the spawn. <p><img SRC="http://www.lof.ukhq.co.uk/sigs/alek.jpg"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ufaiithmysticserenity.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Faiith Mysticserenity</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 5<br> <font color=#E9D756>(9/30/01 12:18:32 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: What were you thinking Affliction?</span><hr size=1> Theodwyn, I have read your post and came to a realization that I believe a fair amount of people have acquired an automatic distrust among many particular guilds. <br>
<br>
Let me explain...as I delve into the abyss of slams and rebuffs against many a player in this conflict I am taken aback by the comments made to my fellow guildmembers. In no way does Belgar or the rest of Legion of Fate represent a guild that is lacking in respect or tact, but exactly the opposite. Mind you, there are a few bad seeds in each guild and I trust that they are eventually weeded out, and in no way does she represent this type of character whatsoever. I do not know the details of the raid you are discussing well enough to make any sort of statement regarding what happened. But I do know Belgar, as well as Toran, Hippocrates, Nickoli, Kelewala and all other LoF members discussed on this topic, as I am sure you can vouche for your guild and other friends. In fear of being redundant, I believe that in the end, most of these unjust acts that have taken place whether it be yesterday or a while ago, have indeed been misunderstandings. If not, keep in mind it is difficult for over 2000 players on one server to all agree on the best way to be fair in distributing loot, camps, and the like.<br>
<br>
You may totally and completely disagree with me, but honestly, don't you think most people have better intentions than the negative characteristics you have described? <br>
<br>
It may be automatic to see a guild as a rivalry, but I would like to see this type of competition between guilds stop. <br>
<br>
My involvement in this ongoing dispute between Affliction and LoF has made me think that maybe we are all better than that and with some cooperation and understanding we can overcome this animosity towards one another. <p><img src="http://communities.msn.com/_Secure/0MwAAAFMSS9KYkcZOtKRPSsUXftP9fFRdCf9R0CsqAQC7!OI5GuJ!k*QWEB8EFHsTHDxfZ!1BTVBbyPE*VIeJ0Q/Faiith.jpg" border="0"><br>

I know many SF I am not flaming you but the 2 people that were giving demands were Hippocrates and Toran... does that sound like something they would demand?&quot;<br>
<br>
Umm YES actually it does sound like Toran!<br>
<br>
Not long ago Vivix and CBA were at the druid ring in LS gathering a naggy raid and LOF walked right past us after porting into the midst of us setting up groups. _________________________________________________<br>
<br>
Hehe LoF had been camping Ragefire for days to have just walked right past you. _________________________________________________<br>
They had maybe 1 group of people 46 to 52 rest were over 52. <br>
Erm at least 50% of the peeps fighting were LoF including myself as a lvl 52 chanter.<br>
____________________________________________________<br>
They asked to let them help us and then in return they take over loot and let everyone even the level 60 warrior and druid that did not even help buff roll on loot. <br>
Now normally just because I am in zone I don’t get to roll on loot so why is it ok for others to do so?<br>
____________________________________________________<br>
Hehe yet again Crom we did not ask you if we could roll on loots and we didnt ask you to come on raid. We heard you were trying to take Naggy and thought would could make the best of a bad situation as not to screw anyone.<br>
____________________________________________________<br>
Toran won his Burnt book on that raid at level 55 and did jack shit for it. Then had the nerve to ask me to run a Vox raid for his frost book.<br>
____________________________________________________<br>
Erm I asked Crom if he lead any Vox raids and I come along with my lvl 52 chanter with VERY nice resist(highly needed on a vox raid)if i could roll on the vox book.<br>
And as for doing jack shit I lined up the whole raid and played part in it and made perfectly clear that i was not in for caster loot but for my main.<br>
____________________________________________________<br>
His rep is so shot to hell at this point people threaten to leave raids if he is allowed to go.<br>
____________________________________________________<br>
uh<br>
hehe would the 50+ peeps that showed up to Sro for hate raid the other day plz post here <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
don't forget , Toran is goin so yall better not come ....<br>
<br>
____________________________________________________<br>
 Sound bad doesn’t it however he tried to do this same damn thing to a hole raid not too long ago. We had people in zone for several hours waiting for us to finish VS. He knew why they were there they told him why they were there and he still tried to get his people down faster. <br>
____________________________________________________<br>
um Crom where you there before i was, i watched each and every one of yas come in the zone, cept maybe if you had a rogue camped there or was anyone you knew there before i was, i had at VERY least 10 peeps in the zone when you got there, i noticed you guys had a rogue logged on there after you got there but even at that I had been in the zone alot longer and as for trying to get peeps down faster we had a raid in the hole, no reason to leave that zone cause someone hopped in our way<br>
<br>
Side note about that raid: Level 60 warrior along for the raid and Toran level 55 pally was MA ? WTF<br>
erm a lvl &quot;56&quot; pally is able to park mobs b4 attacking thus making it so there is no taunt needed when breaking mez, you might learn this some day<br>
<br>
We were down and done in 45 mins they hadn’t made it to golem house yet.<br>
Hmm not sure where we were as we were not able to go down the easy way that time <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> , was a good bit of fun tho <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Rant all you want about how your so picked upon however a lot of the people LOF has been shitting on for months couldn’t give a rats ass when someone else gets sick of your shit and ignores your bizarre demands.<br>
Also would like to say something to you Crom<br>
when we first started on naggy raid LoF was going to have Fanny only roll on book cause he had book of frost. I ended up telling him no, there are a few paladins here and i dont think it fair of just LoF to roll on it.(Is why we all rolled)<br>
Second of all the loot was discussed in chat B4 naggy ever went down and not one person spoke up or had any problem.<br>
Then after all was said and done and 60 druid won a staff someone got upset and said a few things in /ooc, so I asked you directly<br>
 /toran tells you is there a problem, some of your guild seems a bit peeved about the way loots were done<br>
/Crom tells me I run my guild with an Iron fist if there is a problem then they can talk to me and I have no problems with they way it was handled<br>
/Crom tells me also i know you guys are going to be campin in here for awhile could you save any lava rocks for me ?<br>
witch i did for the next few days and tried to go out of my way to get them to Crom over the next few weeks witch is why I am here saying anything about this.<br>
<br>
Crom you are an asshole for flaming me, specially after I was so nice to you and tried to help you out<br>
