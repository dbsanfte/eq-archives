<br>
The short answer is no. The long answer is that Iraq failed to win a war against Iran which borders them. I can't reasonably believe that they would be capable of waging a war against the West.<br>
<br>
Right now, Pakistan and India have nukes. I think the US needs to be more concerned with destabilizing the region furhter than with Saddam.<br>
<br>
Bush is using the same old tired rhetoric that Reagan and his father used against the communist threat to the south of Florida and Mexico. Do we really believe that our enemies are NOT capable of doing vast damage to our population through terrror right now? Again, Bush's administration needs to focus on the real threats and not making more money through oil interests. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/utheodwynriddermark.showPublicProfile?language=EN>TheodwynRiddermark</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 357<br> <font color=#E9D756>(9/20/02 10:19 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=322.topic&index=4>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: .</span><hr size=1> Just an opinion.....<br>
<br>
Wartime mobilzation is good for the economy.  The War on Terror doesn't have enough press to be interesting, doesn't demand enough resources to stimulate investor confidence, not enough of our people are in enough jeopardy to maintain patriotic fever.<br>
<br>
Iraq is a target.  A nation, a person, an enemy, with more groundwork being laid down to rationalize an attack.  More resources needed, and publicized (open war, less commando raids in caves) which keep the press alive.  Overt warfare to scale demands deployment of more resources (which stimulates manufacturing sectors).  And we send more people to fight, which stimulates patriotism.<br>
<br>
Price of oil?  Sure, it matters in one sector of the economy.  But wartime in America is good for all sectors of the economy.  The Great Depression ended with World War II.  The economic recession of the eighties ended with the first Gulf War.<br>
<br>
He who fails to learn the lessons of history is doomed to repeat them.<br>
<br>
I'm not saying it's a bad thing.  If our soldiers go, I support them.  But our government isn't entirely blind to history.  There is no prosperity or quality of life that a people has enjoyed that was not paid for in blood.  Never.  All through world history.<br>

<br>
I don't doubt that many believe that a War time economy is a good economy, or good for the nation.<br>
<br>
However, it should be noted that Korea, Vietnam, and the Persian Gulf wars didn't improve the US economy. In fact, it is arguable that both the Korean war and the Vietnam conflict put the US into the recession of the 70s. <br>
<br>
The Persian Gulf war disrupted the US economy and didn't help it. Oil prices rose sharply (went from $15 per barrel to $40!), consumer confidence (which drives Wall Street) fell sharply. The US spent $60 Billion dollars adding to the growing deficit of the time.<br>
<br>
The US economy is fragile at this time. Spending another 60 billion or as much as 75 billion dollars to wage war on Iraq will bury us. We will see oil prices sky rocket and the already low consumer confidence will pale further causing even more grief on Wall Street.<br>

I just wonder if the US should strike first, without provocation, all countries that hate us? Another thing is that it is going to get pretty expensive for the US to wage war against all that hate us. Do we Americans really want to see our hard earned cash (tax dollars) support a state of continous war?<br>
<br>
For that matter, how many lives do we want to throw away in the name of &quot;War against terrror&quot;? I am all for hunting down Al Queda, but invading Iraq is not at all the same. Will we be invading Syria next? The US government doesn't even mention Syria (who is one of the largest sponsors of terrorist groups in the world), because they are part of OPEC.<br>
<br>
Finally, Pakistan and India have Nukes and the delivery systems to use them regionally. They haven't used them, yet. North Korea has nukes, they haven't used them. I can build a large list of countries (Including Israel, many believe) that have nukes but are fearful of using them. I am not saying they will never be used, but the only country to ever use them has been the United States.<br>
<br>
I doubt seriously that if Saddam had a warhead and delivery system he would use it on the US unless we attacked first.<br>
<br>
Just my opinion. I truly believe the US government is making a huge mistake in persuing Iraq outside the auspices of the UN Security Counsel. It shows that our government is interested in only protecting US oil intersests in the region and not interested in peace for the world. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/urheaton.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Rheaton</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 301<br> <font color=#E9D756>(9/20/02 1:41 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=322.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: .</span><hr size=1> War with Iraq = investment.

I really don't see the investment benefits you are proclaiming will come through war with Iraq.<br>
<br>
For instance, how about we put 70 Billion dollars into alternative energy? Then we can tell OPEC to shove their crude up their arses. Isn't that a better investment than war for oil?<br>
<br>
Also, I don't see Iraq invading other countries, right now. Are you saying that the US should attack them based on intent to use weapons of mass destruction? Why not invade Cuba, after all they hate us and intend harm to the US? Shoot, Cuba could put a dirty bomb on a rubber raft, float it to Key West and explode it. They can do that today! <br>
<br>
What of the US? We have more chemical/biological/nuclear weapons than all other nations. Should Britain form a coalition to invade the US and force us to dismantle our weapons of mass destruction? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/umaeri.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Maeri</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 530<br> <font color=#E9D756>(9/20/02 4:09 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=322.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: .</span><hr size=1> Iraq may or may not have weapons of mass destruction, but the US has large stockpiles of of them, both countries have made unprovoked attacks on other nations, both harbour those who sponsor terrorist acts, it is claimed that Iraq has used chemical weapons against civilian targets (which seems likely, though there are <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.polyconomics.com/searchbase/12-14-00.html">claims otherwise</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->), but  it is undisputed that the US has demonstrated a willingness to use nuclear weapons against civilian targets (yeah, I know that was long in the past...).<br>
<br>
BUT! I'm not suggesting an invasion of the US to disarm them, or instigate a &quot;regime change&quot; (as much as I may like to see one). The reality is that the technology to make weapons of mass distruction, like any technology, is becoming cheaper and easier to obtain. The hardest part of making a nuclear weapon for someone with a large amount of money is probably obtaining the fissionable material, and that can probably be achieved with enough money too. Of course chemical and biological weapons are <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> much</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> cheaper and easier to obtain (eg: <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.geocities.com/giantfideli/cellnews_dangerous_virus_made_from_mail-order_kits.html">Polio from scratch over the internet: &lt;$10,000</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->). Delivery systems are harder, but a terrorist attack doesn't need to come via a missile.<br>
<br>
The solution cannot be to send in the military to stop these weapons being produced. The solution has got to be to address the problems that cause people to want to use them. It's much harder, and I don't know the answers, but I think it is the only way to go. I think this sentiment, expressed by (Australian Greens) Senator Nettle in her <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.aph.gov.au/senate/senators/homepages/web/sfs-AOR.htm">opening speech</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> is a good idea for how to start finding the anwers:<br>

I mean, if you are going to wage a war, and you know with absolute certainty that Iraq has WOMD, and your allies are wanting to know this info, why not give it to them? Why is the US holding out? I know many have mixed feelings in regards to US policy and government, but this is some serious shiit. The proof is coming once all the proper agreements in regards to oil can be resolved....just wait and see. The proof is what will move the rest of the world (or a good portion of it) to support a war....or should I say.. give them reason to support it. <br>
<br>
2. ) Why is Russia so &quot;not sure&quot; about this war? They want weapon inspectors to go back in which is a total waste of time (and a stall tactic until they can be appeased). Russia is using its UN veto power as leverage so that it doesn't get screwed.. Get screwed how? Russia is currently buying oil from Iraq (among other imports and exports) at a ridiculously low price...a Hellofa lot cheaper then Western markets. You cant really blame them... their broke. <br>
<br>
3. ) Why after Bush's little speech before the UN did several Arab nations who were previously totally opposed, all off a sudden tell the US &quot;Yeah, you can now use our soil for your war&quot;? Its because Bush assured the rest of the world we are with the world and not trying to do it all for only us (the US). <br>
<br>
Its as much about each nations own national interest as Desert Storm was about the US's. Its oil and oil prices. Who has it and who controls it. <br>
<br>
Stability: With a loose cannon like Saddam, the rest of the world does not have &quot;security&quot; in their investment (oil). At least in Western eyes.. Every loose cannon provides a potential threat to oil security. <br>
<br>
Another point of contention is Israel. If the US didn't defend and support Israel, most all of the Arab world would be 100% for the US going in to Iraq. Being allied with Israel sets the stage for a possible double-cross. &quot;We like you, but we don't like Israel..and you are allied with her. Our business dealings with you are good, but if Israel ever became a problem, we are not so sure that these business dealings would stay the same.&quot; <br>
<br>
Invest $70 billion in advanced technology so that we are not dependant on oil? Sounds great! I love the idea.. but there is a small problem. Big oil is greedy indeed, but greed or not.. the rest of the world isn't ready. The US could possibly make the quickest and smoothest transition to a AFS. But if the US did it would have a devastating effect on the global economy. The US and rest of the Western world, and its LARGE oil consumption, is what keeps the price of oil down. You wanna start a world-wide shiitstorm? Just decrease US oil usage by 15%.. that should do it. Again, without heavy oil usage, the Middle Eastern oil producing country's would fall into disarray and fast. What else do they to export? Oil is their lifeline. <br>
<br>
Only if the US can and will strike a deal with all concerned country's will it have its war. The US must present this war as an investment in security of finances. <br>
<br>
Which would have a more devastating effect world-wide.. Saddam making small attacks on the US and or western interest.. or the US and western world seizing control of Iraq's oil?<br>

<br>
I agree that there are differences between the enemies of the USA. I think that Iraq is the nose of the camel in the tent. I really don't relish the idea that my government is directing first strike policies towards its enemies.<br>
<br>
Mass destruction capabilities of a country is <b>not</b> a sound reason to attack it in and of itself. If it were a sound reason, then why stop with Iraq? Furthermore, why not dismantle our own weapons of mass destruction?<br>
<br>
It is a double standard. Because the USA carries the biggest stick our government wants to use it to get its way. I guess I would like to see my government return to the policy that the USA will never be the aggressor.<br>
<br>
I agree that the oil lobby and entrenched politicians are part of the problem and is why the US is not going after altrnative fuels. I will say more below, since Rheaton brings up some excellent points, too.<br>
<br>
<b><i>Rheaton:</i></b><br>
<br>
I think you make a valid point in number 1. However, if the government doesn't present the proof to the people, and attacks Iraq, there will be hell to pay... I am sure of that. The last thing Americans want to see are our troops coming home in body bags and not understanding what they died for.<br>
<br>
Concerning point 2, how do you know the weapons inspectors are a waste of time? It has been 9 years since the UN sanctions against Iraq were implemented. Iraq is hungry. They have very short supplies and are eager to see sanctions lifted. It seems to me that they know they are risking alot by not cooperating with the UN. Iraq certaintly can't withstand another 9 years of sanctions. Also, Saddam is worried about fundamentalists in his country. He doesn't want to see them step up a rebellion and throw Iraq into civil war. In fact, he could be certain that the USA would fully support such rebels and that would wreck his country. I think Iraq has good reasons to cooperate this time. I think the USA should just step back, watch, listen and learn. Sometimes inaction is the best solution.<br>
<br>
Concerning point 3. The Sauds and Kuwait said we can use their bases if a UN resolution allowing for an attack is approved. They will not support unilateral action by the USA and they have made that very clear.<br>
<br>
I agree with you that trimming oil consumption by 15% would be a bad thing for the world economy. I am not arguing that we flip a switch and go over to alternative fuel sources overnight. hehehe<br>
<br>
My point is that our dependence upon OPEC has created a Sh<i></i>it storm for us. We should heavily invest in alternative fuels sooner than later. Oil is a finite resource, and being finite it will disapear one day. Too many of us Americans have no regard for the future of our nation. Many have the attitude that our children will deal with problems of fossil fuel consumption and polution. In the meantime, we can buy the biggest gas guzzling SUV or truck and go four wheeling through Salmon streams and old growth forests with impunity. I don't subscribe to this sort of thinking. I look at my two children and want the best for them. Attacking a country because we want to protect oil so that the CTO of the company I work at can continue to drive his 2003 Hummer SUV is just ridiculous. Some Americans need to grab the lock of hair on the back of their neck and tug really hard to pull their heads out. :)<br>
<br>
<i>"Which would have a more devastating effect world-wide.. Saddam making small attacks on the US and or western interest.. or the US and western world seizing control of Iraq's oil?"</i><br>
<br>
That is a good question, Rheaton. However, I don't know what you could mean by "small attacks". Al Queda proved that a small organization of people can sucessfully attack the USA. While our troops are off galloping about in Iraq the borders of the USA are still wide open for terrorist activity. So, the answer to your question is not to attack Iraq, bring all our troops home and secure our nation's borders against terrorism. Let's put the money into human intelligence and catch the terrorists. Afghanistan should have tought us that bombing and ground searches doesn't deliver up terrorists. Bin Laden is still loose with his millions of dollars.<br>
<br>
Finally, Americans should put pressure on their representatives to force Bush to use the CIA and Special forces to assasinate Hussein; rather than spend billions on the mobilization and occupation of Iraq. I don't doubt for a second that we have the capability to cut off the head of Iraq without sending in a single tank or dropping a single bomb. All it takes is determination and humility. Bush wants to mobilize troops because it will give him and his cabinet media exposure. Everyday a smart bomb drops in Iraq is a good day for Bush's news exposure and ratings. Bush learned that from his father who went into the Presidential elections with a 92% approval rating. However, in the end Clinton won because Bush, Sr. proved to be out of touch with the American people and their needs. GW Bush is the same way.<br>
<br>
I will step off the soap box and give another their turn. ;)<br>

I dont know if I think that preemptive strikes are such a bad thing. Best defense is a good offense type stuff. What has to happen before we dismantle the infrastructure of these regimes? Do we do it now when we have reasonable belief that these people want weapons of mass destruction and intend to use them? Do we wait for a strain of small pox to show up in a major city?

<br>
Best defense is a good offense <b>after</b> an aggressor provokes an attack through force. It is an old martial arts idea that those who move first give up something to the opponent. <br>
<br>
Next, I wonder how our government should divide up word powers that hate us and select those to be attacked? OK, we hear having weapons of mass destruction as a condition. Next, harboring terrorists. Have we Americans forgotten the policy that the enemy of my enemy is my friend? Hasn't the history of US involvement in Latin America demonstrated just how the US government works when it comes to over throwing governments not "friendly" to US interests?<br>
<br>
Bush is just using the same tired strategies used in Latin America and applying them in the mid-east. This mistake happened once in Iran and we wound up with Fundamentalists taking over the country.<br>
<br>
Sometimes Trech we do have to wait for tragedy to strike before we can act with honor and moral fortitiude. Let's put it this way. Unless there is a clear and present danger to the US borders, then we have no business launching a first strike on Iraq.<br>
<br>
Personally, I would like to see the US pull all its troops out of the Middle East back into Europe. I am certain that we will be friends with the victors in the area once the dust settles.<br>

Saddam has used chemical agents on a reported 17 occasions against Iran. He invaded Kuwait. He attacked Israel without provocation. He set fire to the oilfields of Kuwait in a self proclaimed effort to send the earth into a nuclear winter. He has repeatedly balked at the UN resolutions set against him, only bending a little when he feels the pressure from the global community. <br>

This dictator started a world war. The war wouldn't have been so large if the rest of the world (U.S. / Europe) would have acted faster.<br>
<br>
A country with radical ideas and ways is one thing, but  aggression must be taken at face value for what it is.<br>
<br>
The only thing that prevented Saddam for arming those scuds with chemical agents (which were launched at Israel) was the fact that he was told &quot;We have field nukes.. if you use weapons of mass-destruction -we will too&quot; However, this time will be different cause he has nothing to loose.<br>
<br>
We cannot embrace and coddle this &quot;wayward child&quot;. Saddam belongs in jail (or dead) as an outright criminal... not a case for the state to try and reform. His issues are far more reaching then anomocities towards Israel and the US (or entire western culture for that matter). He is a certified nut case... Not a crazy drunk bum on the streets that mumbles to himself.. But a zealous, controlling, pathological dictator that has his own plans for this world. We can only judge him by his actions and thats it. His &quot;good&quot; intentions mean nothing in the face of hostile aggression...aggression he has acted on and provoked.<br>
<br>
Iraq made an aggressive attempt to overtake Kuwait and its oil market... one good turn deserves another. It all depends on whos side your on. Two wrongs dont make a right, but its either his way or our way. I trust our way alot more then his. <p><font color=#FFaa36>
