Their intricate dance led them to land on the robes of a venerable old man sitting on a log, staring into the infinite stars. The old man's ears seemed to perk up. Startled, he looked around at an unheard sound. Standing up, the spell-caster's peace came over his face. Bluish waves seemed to emenate from his body. His image shimmered and was hidden be the blue wall. When it receded, the old man was nowhere to be found. The log he was on rocked. A stick picked itself up and poked the fire. All was silent but for the fire.<br>
Stealthily, a smaller man poked his head out from behind a tree. His earthy garb hid him from eyes that might have seen him. He looked upon a small camp in a clearing, with a cackling fire and a poking stick next to a log. Slowly drawing a knife from his belt, he motioned his men forward. Four other men seemingly appeared from nowhere and entered the camp. Motioned gestures from the small man directed the four larger men, and they soon were quietly searching. <br>
&quot;Damn!&quot; cursed the small man. &quot;He's gone. Look for the book,&quot; he said to his men. The four men hesitated. &quot;Do it now!&quot; The four men were soon tearing apart the camp, looking for a book. &quot;Cypher, come here.&quot; The largest of the men looked up, and obediently trotted over to where the small man was. &quot;Take this, and don't be afraid to use it.&quot; Gently, he handed him a red crystal. &quot;Call on the fire and it will work.&quot; <br>
&quot;Thank you, sir. Is it for the wizard?&quot; <br>
&quot;Yes, Cypher,&quot; said the gnome, exasperated. &quot;Of course it is. Now go find me the book.&quot;<br>
The men had found nothing, and they were now hungry. Rustling through the wizard's packs, they found food enough for all of them, and more. Greedily, they broke them open.<br>
&quot;Wait!&quot; The gnome cursed. &quot;Coskit, try this.&quot; He handed the smallest of the four men a lump of meat. Eagerly, he stuffed it in his mouth and reached for more. Before he could, he cried out. Spitting out the meat in his mouth, he nearly vomited. Panic shone in his eyes. He turned and retched. When he was done, he turned to the gnome. &quot;I-I-I think I'm ok now,&quot; he stammered, and toppled over. He was dead before he hit the ground.<br>
The gnome cursed. The remaining three men looked unsteady and nervous. Suddenly, a voice rang out. &quot;Leave here! It is not your place to be! Leave now, or you will all suffer fates as that man!&quot;<br>
One man glanced around, and then bolted into the forest. Cypher and the other man made a grab for him, but missed. He was gone. The voice rang out again. &quot;You have put your lives in forfeit over this one man. Who are you to dare this?&quot;<br>
The gnome's face was filled with chagrin. He raised his fists. White fire burst from his clenched hands. &quot;I am Okavea! I dare challenge your power!&quot; With that, the fire spread from his hands to all corners of the clearing. When it cleared, the old man stood standing where the trees had once been. &quot;Go, get him and get the book!&quot;<br>
The wizard smiled. He raised his hands to his waist. Calling upon his power, hot red fire spewed from those palms. The wizard gestured. The ground opened up before one of the men, and fire erupted from the ground. The man screamed in agony as his flesh was seared from his bones. He fell to his knees, still burning, and still alive. Cypher unsheathed his sword and lunged at the wizard. The old man dodged his attack, and now was spewing green ropes from his hands. Cypher reared back his sword for a killing blow, and lunged. His sword swung, but Cypher's feet were now firmly planted on the ground. He was sinking. The wizard laughed as Cypher struggled. To Cypher's horror, the wizard was now surrounded by spiraling balls of pure force. He finished his casting. Cypher screamed in fear, and then in pain as he felt the force slam into his body. His clothes were torn from his body violently. A second after, he felt a horrible pain as his flesh was rend from his body. He fell to the ground, a mass of broken life.<br>
The wizard glared at the gnome. &quot;Okevea, eh? Why are you here? My book? You thought to steal my spells for yourself?&quot;<br>
The gnome puffed himself up. &quot;Yes. You do not deserve those spells. They are mine.&quot;<br>
&quot;Yours? I worked decades, centuries for these spells, and you think to take them away? Foolish child, thinking to have it all. Leave now and you shall live.&quot; He gestured to the two bodies. &quot;Stay, and you will not.&quot;<br>
Orkvea looked up into the wizards eye. &quot;Ro`Jetthe? I remember your father.&quot; He snickered. &quot;He and my father used to play together. I remember the day my father came home, and told me of killing yours. We drank well, that day.&quot; He grinned.<br>
Lamil Ro`Jetthe rose to his full height. &quot;You will die for your ignorance and arrogance,&quot; he whispered. &quot;You do not deserve to walk this plane.&quot; He shoved out his hands. The gnome, quickly prepared, was soon covered in a ball of sheet ice. The bolt of frost struck Lamil in the side, nearly knocking him over and rimming the edges of his robe with hard ice. Lamil was otherwise unfazed. Red fire erupted from his entire being. It was like nothing he had ever done before, it seemingly came from instinct. It seemed Ro`Jetthe was burning, burning like no fire could possibly duplicate. Righteous wrath blazed in his eyes, and the unholy fire began to solidify. The gnome's eyes were wide with fear as he quickly began to cast another ice spell. It was too late for him.<br>
The fire erupted. All around Okevea was a massive wall of flame. Okevea screamed in pain as the flames seared his flesh and melted his clothes to his body. Okevea cried in pain and waited for death to come. Lamil's eye glinted with steel as he glowered at the burning form. &quot;As forever I have loved my father, forever you shall burn.&quot; He turned and walked away.<br>
Okevea did not have the strength to scream. He collapsed to his knees, the all encompassing fire bringing him untold agonies and pain beyond imagination, for all eternity.<br>
<br>
The campfire popped as a log cracked, and dancing fireflies of flame flew into the air. Their intricate dance led them to land on the robes of a venerable old man sitting on a log, staring into the infinite stars. A tear rolled down his cheek. &quot;You are avenged, father,&quot; he whispered. He layed down. &quot;Please forgive me.&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrroleplaying.showPrevMessage?topicID=29.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrroleplaying.showNextMessage?topicID=29.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrroleplaying.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=29.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/gfx/addReply1.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrroleplaying.emailToFriend?topicID=29.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrroleplaying.threadControl?topicID=29.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/deleteThreadFire.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrroleplaying.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=29.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrroleplaying.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=29.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub4.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="emarrmessageboardrules">Message Board Rules<option value="emarrlinks">Links<option value="emarrupcomingmmorpgs">Upcoming MMOG's<option value="emarrfrm18">America Under Attack<option value="emarrfrm19">Dark Age of Camelot<option value="emarrgeneral">General<option value="emarrfrm17">Funny Stuff<option value="emarrbazaar">Item Bazaar<option value="emarrscrollsnspells">Spell Bazaar<option value="emarrfrm15">Shiny Things<option value="emarrfrm14">Bargain Basement<option value="emarrfrm20">Crafter's Hideout<option value="emarrdragonsandplanes">Rants and Flames<option value="emarrfrm13">Dragons and Planes<option value="emarrroleplaying">Roleplaying<option value="emarrroleplayingoocforum">Roleplaying - OOC Forum<option value="emarrscammeralert">Scammer Alert<option value="emarrsignaturecorner">Test Forum<option value="emarrreallife">Real Life<option value="emarrothermmorpgs">Other MMOG's</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#E9D756>- </font><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/bemarr>Erollisi Marr, The Queen of Love</a><font color=#E9D756> - </font><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrroleplaying>Roleplaying</a> <font color=#E9D756> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- Begin BOTTOM AD Script -->
