<br>
<br>
30 people raid, 15 win armor. 15 do not. 9 blue diamonds drop, 12 diamonds, 7 jacinths, 4 black saphires. It's just numbers folks for illustrations.<br>
<br>
Number the 15 names who did not win armor, random off the Blue diamonds to them, leaving 6 people without winning anything at all yet. Give a diamond to them, maybe a jacinth, too? Then random off all the other gems to the people who attended.<br>
<br>
Everyone walks away with the best loot the could have gotten. No one walks away with out getting something and the best possible deal they could have gotten.<br>

If you feel that you need to be paid for leading a raid, you shouldn't do it.  Given your history on this server, I'm not surprised at all that you would try to snag a little free loot.<br>
<br>
Giving a BD to the MA and puller makes no sense at all.  Most tanks *want* to be the MA, and most monks/SKs *want* to be the puller.  Why pay someone for doing something that they want to do?  (Unless, of course, you're just tossing the MA and puller onto the list to make it less blatant that you're sticking a free BD in your own pocket.)<br>
<br>
In theory, a system that allocated gems based on who won armor and who spent the most time on the raid would be fair.  I wouldn't care to hassle with that sort of system.  And I certainly wouldn't want someone like you making decisions about valuable loot. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/utormentcia.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tormentcia</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 123<br> <font color=#E9D756>(8/8/01 7:15:09 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The fairest way in PoG?</span><hr size=1> Now I can see your theory behind paying for &quot;services rendered&quot; so to speak, but why a BD?

So puller and main tank had to die.(=exp lost)<br>
<br>
But in PoG,there is no Death Touch,if we don't fight Tunare.So pulling or tanking dose not mean exp lost.<br>

I suggest a plan,<br>

BD &amp; Dia&gt;all random<br>
the other gems&gt;Valric,all you should take,and give who,you think,should be get(ex:You,CLR or some good race player for helping us,finaly plz give us by Alpha(lol))<br>

Who said I would be making decisions? If you don't like it anyway, don't come to my fucking raids. But it's simple seems how you asked.<br>
<br>
30 people come, 12 people don't win armor. Got 8 blue diamond drops.<br>
<br>
Assisgn a number to those 12 people, random it 1-12. Until all BD's are gone. Then go with the diamonds, once they all got a gem, random the rest of the diamonds to everyone, then jacinths, and then black saphires. <br>
<br>
Some people walk away with jack shit bro. And sadly it leaves a bitter taste in their mouth when they see someone win bp/legs, a bd, and a spell they wanted. Granted it doesn't happen to me, I'm just being realistic and trying to come up with a fair solution.<br>
<br>
Your saying you don't care everyone comes out on top, because you think it's just a tad bit more of a hassle? Well I'm glad to see, with you being such an aspiring raid leader that you don't want to take that extra step to make sure everyone who came to the raid left with a smile.<br>

You want to have the thread moved to Rants and Flames *after* you edit your original post to change what you said.  Having said something flameworthy, you want to delete it and replace it with something that sounds reasonable.  That way, it looks like you're being flamed for no good reason.  Do you really think people are that stupid?<br>
<br>
What your original post said was that you wanted to award *yourself* a BD for your efforts in leading the raid.  And it wasn't just an &quot;idea.&quot;  In the post announcing your PoG raid this weekend, you said that you were going to do exactly that.  It should come as no surprise to anyone that you edited that post, too.<br>
<br>
Despite your sneaky use of the edit function, you can't hide the truth.  You tried to convince everyone that it was okay to scam a free BD for being a raid leader.  I called you on it, and now you're trying to change the subject to something that you really don't care about.  Unfortunately for you, you can't edit *my* posts.<br>
<br>
Hopefully, you'll finally quit begging me to come on your raids, and stop harassing me to let you come on ours.  I know what kind of a person you are, and I would never go on a raid with you under any circumstances.  Sadly, there are still people out there who don't realize what a lowlife scumbag you are.<br>

<br>
  Little off subject, but do you have ANY idea how often a high level monk gets BEGGED to go on a pickup PoH raid to pull?  It happens less often for me now, as usually I'm stuck somewhere like Veeshans Peak... but I'll typically get at least one /tell a week asking me to go and pull PoH / PoF.<br>
<br>
  When I used to do this I would tell the raid leader, straight up, that I'd only consider doing it if I was paid by my choice of gem that fell.  I've yet to have a raid refuse that condition.  Why should you pay me for something that they want to do?  Uhhh, because I don't like dying multiple times for everyones benefit but my own, and I'd not have come on the raid if you hadn't shown me some consideration for my time.  <br>
<br>
  member, monk planar armor &lt;BITES&gt;.  Even now, with the Vellious high-level armor, I wear ONE peice of monk specific armor... my Celestial Fists.<br>
<br>
  Basically the point I'm trying to make is not every monk likes pulling.  Not every shadow knight likes it either.  And for the monk especially what she's doing is going out and getting killed so that the raid doesn't get wiped out... and getting very little to show for it compared to other classes.<br>

However, Valric, before he edited his way out of it, stated he felt a BD should go to the puller, the MA and the raid leader(s).  Why the hell would you pick the most expensive gem to drop on the planes and not a diamond?  Not good enough for you perhaps?  Everyone is up on those raids doing the same thing and risking the same experience.  Big whoop if the MA or the puller dies.  They're going to get an exp rez, always a 56 rez if they're on mine or Sage's raids, and both are probably pretty used to dying by these levels.  If they didn't want to do the job, they wouldn't agree to it.  <br>
<br>
Sage hits it on the head and it's apparent by the slick editing job by Valric -- this is someone who doesn't get to play on raids very often because of his reputation, and now he's just proving why he has the reputation by stating that he, the almighty raid leader, should get a blue diamond because he knows how to create groups and tell people what to do.  If you expect compensation for doing something you're volunteering to do, you're insane.  If you don't like that you don't get compensated, don't do it.  There are plenty of others who will do it and can probably do it better.   <p>Tormentcia

The whole damn topic was about randoming gems at the end, to the people who did not win.<br>
<br>
Here is for you Sagemon. I had wrote in my original post. MA, puller, and raid leader get a BD for their service. Happy? Like it matters. This is not a big fuggin deal. I just wanted people to read the post, with what it was meant for. Gems randomed at end to people who didn't win, then to everyone.<br>
<br>
And I also removed me, the raid leader for my upcoming PoG raid, from recieving a BD. Why? Well simple. Yes I need it. But if it's going to cause so much grief becuase I am leading it then I won't take it. But as far as the puller who is in almost full Noctivagant, but one damn fine PoG puller, I am giving him a BD. I'm also giving the Main Assist a BD. And right now I don't care. That's how it's going. I'll let the raid decided how they want to do Gem drops.<br>
<br>
So no Sagemon, I didn't try to pull some slick move. I just didn't want more people who may be ignorant such as yourself to flame a topic, which was created to voice opinions on an idea. Which you hardly did either. <br>

Having run my own raids, it would look very greedy for me to claim three 4k items for really no reason at all.  Why should anyone  automatically get compensated for leading, pulling or being the main assist especially in a zone that doesn't cost anything to go into! Because of the stress associated with leading? You chose to lead the raid, deal with the stress. Because the MA &amp; Puller will most likely die a couple times? They knew the risk of the position before they took it, deal with it.  Raids are run for armor (usually) and it reflects better upon you as a raid leader if you keep yourself on the same random chart as everyone else.<br>
<br>
Second, though in theory your loot distribution method would allow all a chance to win something - it really is not logical.  Why should Player_X not be allowed in the rolls because he had to leave before the raid ended? All of my raids have been 10-12+ hours and it really just is not right to cut someone out of the random because they couldn't stay.<br>
<br>
Idea #1 - Keep a running list of EVERYONE who attended the raid.  So, at the end of the raid, even Player_X who had to leave 4 hours into the raid has the chance at a gem.  This would be the raid leader's responsibility to make sure Player_X got his gem the next time he was online/available.<br>
<br>
Idea #2 - Keep armor &amp; gems on the same random. That way everyone can earn at least one item.  This method will certainly not win friends &amp; influence people.<br>
<br>
Or stay with my personal favorite:<br>
Armor, BPs, BDs and Gems are all on separate rolls. (PoH)I am compensated with cash loot until stones cost are covered. After which the clerics are compensated with 3 cash items to cover peridot cost. Then cash loot randomed to zone. (All other planes) Clerics are compensated with 3 cash items to cover peridot cost. Then cash loot randomed to zone.<br>

I am a huge proponent of, &quot;My raid, my rules. Don't like the rules, don't go on the raid&quot;. Makes Player_X look really dumb if he signs up for a raid &amp; then proceeds to argue with the loot rules that were already set forth.  However, it is highly recommended that you choose a loot policy that is fair to EVERYONE that attends the raids.  Out of all of my raids, I have had 1 person argue with me regarding loot distribution.  He felt it was unfair that I allowed a player to possibly receive 2 pieces of planar armor while the others may not have gotten on yet.  My response? &quot;My Raid, My Rules&quot;.  Having only one person actively tell me they don't like the loot rules leads me to believe my loot policy is the most fair that I could have.<br>

It must really get under your skin that you can't get away from your reputation.  At least you've quit telling people that you're Valric 2.0 and not the original scumbag.  No one believed that pathetic lie anyway.<br>
<br>
You can spin doctor all you want, Valric, but those of us who know you can see right through it.  It must have driven you nuts to go on a PoG raid and see all those BDs drop.  All that money, and it just got randomed to other people.  So now that you're leading the raid (and people are stupid enough to follow you), you'll award yourself a BD for leading the raid, and a BD if you don't win any armor.  And there will probably be a few BDs that get lost in your backpacks, so you'll just hang on to those, too.<br>
<br>
Remember that Hate raid a few months ago where you and Gorndax really got into it?  Remember how you got flamed by Gorndax later on?  Well, let me add one detail to that story that I've never mentioned before.  Gorndax said in one of his posts that he added someone to our group because he was afraid that you would try to steal loot, and he wanted someone in the group to watch you.  Gorndax was dead on the money there.  Several times that night, you had told the other members of the group (me and some of your guildmates from Chain of Honor) that we should just keep anything that dropped off of mobs that we looted.  I said hell no, and so did your former guildmates.  That was when I realized what a complete and utter jackass you are, and I have never grouped or raided with you again.<br>
<br>
Kaldiin and Laoke, you guys are raising some valid points.  But please remember that the person proposing this stuff is Valric, not some reputable raid leader.  Letting this guy handle loot at a raid is like hiring a kleptomaniac as a bank teller. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/bemarr.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=sagemon>Sagemon</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 192<br> <font color=#E9D756>(8/9/01 5:41:32 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The fairest way in PoG?</span><hr size=1> Yeah, I pretty much agree with that, Siilverain.  The only thing that we do that is significantly different is that armor and BPs are not on entirely separate rolls.  If you've won a lesser armor piece, you can still roll on a BP.  If you've already won a BP, however, you can't roll on a less armor piece unless everyone else has won something.  That seems fair to us, but frankly that sort of situation doesn't come up very often. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uvalricentreri.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Valric Entreri</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 160<br> <font color=#E9D756>(8/9/01 6:39:49 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The fairest way in PoG?</span><hr size=1> Your such a lieing asshole Sagemon.

And for your information Gorndax and I brought our differences together. We are not the best of chums, but we talk. <br>
<br>
So let me see what your trying to say? You think I went to one PoG raid, saw the BD's drop and am going ecstatic? Well let me put it this way. I have my own BD resist gear, which I bought/traded for. I don't need them pal. I've co-lead PoG pick up raids with Stone Guard. And have been on a total of 10+ PoG raids. SO don't give me your bull shit. I've done my share of raiding, and did some leading. Now it's going up to leading raids. I don't have to do these raids, but I am. <br>
<br>
As for the remarks about multiple posts. It's becuase I say what I have to say and post it. Then I think about it and there is stuff to add. Instead of editing them or waiting for people to respond, and get called some things because you instead just say it's some 'click editing'.<br>

Yup that's right, not a single person in the 10 or so raids to Hate I've done has anyone received a piece of Cash Loot.  Of course every single raid to Hate I've done has been guild only and all of those gems have been turned into resist gear.  I've always been handed a stack of Peridots at the beginning of the raid and a 2nd stack in the middle of it.<br>
<br>
Personally I believe that the Raid Leader has final say on all loot issues and they should make everyone aware of them up front.  If you don't like the rules, don't go.  It's just that simple.<br>
<br>
In this case, it's really dumb to make loot rules that clearly favor the Raid Leader, ESPECIALLY when the Raid Leader has such a negative reputation as it is.<br>
<br>
I have done a total of 4 pickup raids in my life.  2 Were total disastors, 1 was fairly decent, and the last 1 was fantastic.  The only fantastic pickup raid that I did was with Crinkle against Vox.  It was my last chance to see a Dragon and I had a really good time.  Crinkle is a damn good raid leader and I'd gladly raid with him again regardless of what loot rules he put in place.  Crinkle wants to give himself a Blue Diamond auto?  No problem with that.  Valric (a known scammer, tool, and all around jerk) wants to give himself a blue Diamond auto?  Heck yeah I have a problem with that.  I'm a hypocrite but the difference is leaders.  Established Raid Leader I trust, Valric I don't. <p>Islington Angelwatch<br>

Like most conmen and scammers, Valric just can't keep his lies straight.  Did you notice that he said that he patched up his differences with Gorndax, which means he is Valric 1.0, and then turned around and claimed to be Valric 2.0?  I'm sure Stone Guard will be thrilled to read that Valric is such a close ally of theirs.  He's been hanging out with some Domination folks, and I'm sure he'll toss their name into the mix pretty soon.<br>
<br>
The first time I met this loser was when Nilluas/Roggo asked me to help Chain of Honor kill the General for Roggo's epic.  A few days later, I helped CoH again when Valric got his epic.  Then one night Valric asked me to help them out in the Hole, and I agreed.  It turned out to be a multi-group raid led by Lummox to kill High Scale Kirn and Ghost of Kindle.  After about half an hour, one of the CoH people (a female troll shaman) suddenly gated out of the raid.  It turned out that Valric had been verbally abusing her in tells, and so she just left.  That gave me a bad feeling about the guy, but I brushed it off.  Later in the raid, he suggested that we just keep any items that we looted, rather than sharing them with Lummox.  At the time, I thought he was just joking.  I mean, what kind of a lowlife would seriously suggest doing that?<br>
<br>
The next time I remember seeing Valric was the infamous Hate raid.  After that, I knew what kind of person he was, and I wanted nothing further to do with him.  A few days later, CoH disbanded because people like Valric had given the guild such a horrible reputation.  It's good to see that most of the good people in CoH have eventually landed in reputable guilds.<br>
<br>
Anyway, it's sad that people are actually going on raids with this scumbag.  Of course, Pidnus, Mumaden, Trayler, and Airaman probably find groups, too. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uvalricentreri.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Valric Entreri</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 162<br> <font color=#E9D756>(8/9/01 8:28:01 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The fairest way in PoG?</span><hr size=1> Sagemon, your a fucking moron.

How many times you going to mix up the events? Maybe your not moxing them up, perhaps just purposely distorting them because your a dick.<br>

I am the one who was at the hate raid who got in an arguement with Gorndax. I wasn't the one who did that to Vishanti. I am the one who got the epic. So, you can basically kiss my ass and go ahead spouting your bullshit stories bro.<br>

Not only are you stupid, but completely stupid. Roggo spawned his,we killed it, then we spawned mine and killed it. That night I turned my stuff in becoming the first to get an epic in CoH. So go ahead you lieing ass and ask him.<br>

Sagemon doesn't like me at all. And I don't give a shit. But hell if he wants to start lieing to hurt my rep then he can go for it.
