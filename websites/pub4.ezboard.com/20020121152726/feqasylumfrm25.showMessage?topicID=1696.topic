<br>
TRK had a nice little Fear raid tonight for Eladamiri's birthday, guild and close friends only.  Well turns out most of the demis were up (or popped while we were in the plane) and Cazic was up too.  Tanise, being the um &quot;enthusiastic and ambitious&quot; peep that he is (putting it nicely :P) wanted to put together a force to keel Cazic after we cleared the plane.  So we broke into fear with no deaths and no evacs...cleared most of the plane and took down Fright with only a little aggro control trouble.  Took down Dread with no deaths besides DTs.<br>
<br>
Then we gathered below Terror's hill and prepared to pull him.  Unfortunately the main tank ate the Amy HTs, cleric had to CH early, Terror ate the cleric and subsequently ping ponged to every other healer and caster before aggro was regained by the MT -- we still got him to 30% without healers or casters though.  So we rezzed everyone back in and were buffing to pull him again (with a better plan), when all of a sudden in the zone appear a few peeps who were not on the raid and said nothing to the raid leader or me (please leave the names unmentioned here, the situation has been dealt with).  Soon after they show up at camp, mentioning that they were there for a pally's epic turnin, and one of them Hails CT in the distance.<br>
<br>
Now all the raiders had been told already &quot;don't hail CT or a demi because it will cause uber nasty aggro things.&quot;  I have no idea if any of that is true or not, it sounds rather far fetched to me, but anyhow CT was hailed by one of the peeps who had just shown up.<br>
<br>
Within a minute or two of this, an imp, Terror, Terror's guards, and several GLs charged the camp.  All of our clerics were OOM and we didn't have a chance.  Total wipeout.<br>
<br>
I entered the zone again with clerics to begin rezzes.  This time however one of our clerics and another person coming to help got eaten along the way by mobs wandering WAY out of their usual paths.  There were GLs wandering near the portal!  The other cleric and I got safely to the camp and began rezzes.  Once nearly all the rezzes were done, and I was off dragging a corpse on the other side of the zone, about 6 GLs + pets appeared in camp.  I rushed back and started madly AE mezzing.  We had a few good tanks standing and I managed to keep everything mezzed enough so that I thought we would make it....when Terror charged the camp and wiped us out AGAIN.<br>
<br>
We were not even remotely in aggro range of Terror or his guards.  Everything in fear was cleared up to our current camp, and we had spent a good 20 minutes at that camp spot the first time buffing and remaking groups, with no aggro whatsoever.  Nobody left the camp except the people who entered the zone after our first wipeout, and they did not bring terror with them -- they were standing at the camp unaggrod for a few minutes before Terror + adds charged.  Unless I'm missing something, or unless someone ran out without my noticing (and yes I was facing that way) and trained us, I suppose it had to be this strange &quot;hailing&quot; bug that aggrod us.  But Cazic Thule did not aggro, Terror and his friends did!  Any input on why this may have happened?  Similar experiences, etc.?<br>
<br>
I want to thank all who came to help celebrate Elad's birthday and who made it a nearly flawless raid up to that point, especially for a raid with so many planar first-timers!!  I also want to thank all the friends who offered to come help take down CT -- had these mishaps not occurred, we would've had a shot at him if any &quot;open&quot; raid ever had one. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I had friends from MW, T&amp;A, Visions, FL, BoO and others offering to come help and we had not even seriously started recruiting yet.  'Tis a shame we did not get to attempt the ugly turd.<br>
<br>
Loot and such will be handled on the TRK forums, as soon as Tanise posts his roster for me to roll from.  Please check the forums here, will post the specific link as soon as he makes it:<br>

And I will ask TRKers to add any details they feel I have left out to help sort out all this.<br>

Coupled with a few people not on the raid possibly causing some agro.<br>
<br>
However, the hailing thing for CT seems rather far fetched to me, every time i've been to fear with CT up (probably like 10 times now, for new CT) people tend to hail when they see him, never caused any problems at all. I have a few times pulled fear with a full spawn (being draco, all 3 demis, and CT), and never saw any weird agro concerning hails.<br>
<br>
A few comments though. If you moved to the base of Terror's hill, you're in the graveyard area. There are some roaming mobs here, which could explain the imp. Its a bad place to fight, better to pull Terror back to the frightfinger house. <br>
<br>
Also, in that position you're getting pretty close to the glare lord bridge, and I would not rule out the possibility of chain agroing some of them when you bring out an entire raid to that location. Won't happen for high level people, as the agro range reduces a lot with level, but have a few 46s in the mix so close to a large amount of mobs, and you're asking for trouble.<br>
<br>
Also a note on pathing, which I imagine is the reason you had GLs at the portal. Pathing for mobs that lose agro near the zone walls (due to someone dying or feigning there) is pretty screwed up in several places. For instance when pulling temple, if you feign in the wrong place the entire temple will path along the entire length of the west wall from north to south, before heading back home. On the east end of the south wall, mob can path westwards for quite a while along the wall before returning home.<br>
<br>
Anyways, not being there of course I have no way of telling exactly which of these, if any, applies to what happened, but hopefully these theories can help you in figuring it out <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I do know that there is EXTREMELY BAD pathing when it comes to pulling terror as I think we pulled him about 10 times before we actually fought him.  We were trying to pull from the west wall after we fought draco and that just didn't work.  He always got lost in the pathing.<br>
<br>
So we moved to the standard south wall camp after the scareling (gold tower) house.  There -- again we attempted to pull terror.  I lost him in the pathing once.  But after I lost him in the pathing -- Glare Lords started to pop in the camp.  I believe these were lost in pathing from the first couple times I tried to pull terror, and finally popped on top of us ... I think terror just has a bigass aggro radius and bad pathing... so he ended up going to the glare lords or close by and pissing them off at us too.<br>
<br>
Anyhow... just my 2 coppers. <p><img src="http://personal.nbnet.nb.ca/sicras/images/kiras-sig.jpg"><BR>

<br>
Nascens was pulling, but he had just /qed out prior to us moving to this camp.  The pathing of terror to us was straight down his hill, every time he came.  The first time we pulled him he came straight to us with no adds except his guards, and we had had no mobs path through us for 20-30 minutes.  The second and third times there were many GL adds, and the third time we had GLs first, then terror about 2 minutes later (after everyone below 55 in the camp was dead :P).  We weren't in the GY, but rather in the huge clear area east of his hill.  We also weren't near any walls...<br>
<br>
I do agree that it was probably a bad choice of camp without having cleared as much as we could (although having cleared more wouldn't have saved us either time), but we had killed the previous two demis at the base of their hills without any problem at all. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/umerkabaupon.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Merkaba UPoN</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>p0\/\/3r-p0sT3r!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(11/13/01 2:52:16 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumfrm25.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1696.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: CT &amp; Demi aggro and the TRK 11/12 raid, input needed</span><hr size=1> Well 6 of us went up after you guys left to finish a pally epic, we did some clearing along the way.
