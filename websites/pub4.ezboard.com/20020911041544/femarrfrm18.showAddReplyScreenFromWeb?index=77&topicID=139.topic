You not only continue to accuse me of being Mors, but you needlessly come to my Guild's message boards and flame me AND Umbrae. You now Flame Emberial and Zendell, who have probably been the most civil in this thread. Zendell and Emberial, if you can read, were not defending my opinions. As stated by Emberial, they were simply stating that I am not Mors. I know everyone else in my guild were deeply saddened by the events. And had you done more than grab a random thread on our boards, you would realise this.<br>
<br>
Here's the deal :<br>
1) I am NOT Mors. Had I the inclination to post something here, I would do it under my own Login. <br>
2) My name is Ibiar, not Ibriar.<br>
3) My feelings on the events that occured do not reflect anyone but me.<br>
4) The ONLY reason I posted here at all, is because of the /tells I was getting in game. I came here to clairify that I AM NOT MORS. Under ANY message board that I sign up for, I sign up as VenomsLust, Always have and will always continue to.<br>
5) Yes, you have every right to think of me as a &quot;sick fuck&quot;, or whatever that will change to.<br>
6) Yes, I can be crass, cold, and seemingly unemotional at times. But, anyone that has been around me for more than a few piddly posts, will know that I will do alot for others when they need help.<br>
<br>
To anyone else, please reread my posts. As I stated, I do NOT condone or take enjoyment out of the events. But I am not as heart-struck as most people will be. In tense situations, I will generally try to &quot;lighten&quot; the mood. My statement in DL (not EC) in /ooc chat WAS inappropiate. And to those that were present when I said it, please accept my appology if you took offense to it.<br>
<br>
So, I ask that you please leave my guild out of this, and cease this witch-hunt on my name. <p><center>

Got your name wrong.  Sue me.  I'm more of a troublemaker than Mors?  What a bunch of crap!  Your continued trivializing and rationalizing of his comments make you seem even more complicit in his conduct.<br>
<br>
I didn't come to your board and flame you and Umbrae, I just let your guild know you both were saying things over here that were embarassing to them.  Not a flame, and I stand by it.  If I had the misfortune of being associated with you, I'd be embarassed.<br>
<br>
I didn't choose a random thread on your board.  I simply posted in the public forum there in order to get the attention of your guild members in the most active such thread.  You and they can argue they weren't justifying your comments, but the fact that all they claimed was that you weren't Mors, something they couldn't possibly know for certain, suggests their lockstep response was without thought or inspection.  It is intriguing that they've failed to address the fact that you've agreed with Mors initial comments, and even taken it further.<br>
<br>
Nope, not gonna leave anyone's guild out of this.  If you are pathetic enough to try and lessen the gravity of this situation with your sick sense of humor, then I will hold it against anyone that would continue to condone your conduct and associate with you.  They're bad decision to stand by you under these circumstances is beyond foolish. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uemberial.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Emberial</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://members.home.net/killgasm/curley_sm_clr.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#E9D756>(9/14/01 9:40:30 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=139.topic&index=101>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: population control</span><hr size=1> Raedwolf:<br>
<br>
I hate to stoop down to your level of name calling as it makes me no better than you, but I can't seem to help myself in this case. You are a MORON (or Moran <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ) of the 1st degree. Do you even read, let alone comprehend, any of what I have said? Here...I will use little sentences and small words-<br>
<br>
1. I do not agree with what Ibiar said. I have said this already. As Zendell said, things are being done about it in guild. Just because we don't keep YOU updated doesn't mean nothing is being done.<br>
<br>
2. You are right. I don't know 100% that Ibiar is not Mors. But knowing him in game and in RL I think our guild (95% who are RL friends and work together) are more able to judge whether he is Mors or not than YOU are. Hell, your mother could be Mors, but I am not going to point fingers until I hang out with her a bit.<br>
<br>
3. You have a traceable history of accusing ppl to be hiding under another nick. That hints of obsession and paranoia to me. (Doesn't matter how many other ppl do it, too. We're talking about YOU.) As I have already said, if some schmuck came in here and started posting crap and someone else claimed it was a sheep in Raedwolf's clothing, I would just as vehemently (oops, sorry...big word)...strongly defend you...or atleast call for concrete proof. Thus my &quot;thoughtless&quot; and &quot;lockstep&quot; response.<br>
<br>
It's ppl like you who point fingers at anyone that doesn't automatically repudate the accused, that is the real tragedy during these sad times. Last time I looked it's still America, and that means &quot;innocent until PROVEN guilty&quot;. It's ppl like you who are beating up supposed GUILTY &quot;Muslims&quot; in America mearly because of the color of their skin and the turban on their head. It's ppl like you who are too busy holding moral court to see that not everyone is the enemy just because they don't think like you think (and I'm not speaking of Mors but EVERYONE you have bashed without proof of their duplicity).<br>
<br>
Feel free to write what you want (and you will..God Bless America), but I am done with this subject, with you, and with posting on this thread. If anyone else feels the need for additional clarity of my statements feel free to write to emberial@hotmail.com since I'm not gonna check this thread anymore. I don't guarantee a response.<br>

Yep, read and understood what you posted.  I responded point by point.<br>
<br>
2.  Your decision to keep your chastisement of Ibiar (accepting your word that such has taken place) to your own board is your choice.  Frankly, that seems pointless to me.  He's dirtied your guild's name by his conduct.  Some public distancing from his comments (which you guys have finally made, sorta) would seem to be appropriate.<br>
<br>
3.  Your silly labelling of me regarding the witchhunts and stereotypes is ludicrous.  We've had a rash of anonymous flames lately.  I've been trying to stamp it out.  I also happen to read the board and post a lot.  The dupes have primarily had as their source either fools and trolls trying to say something vile or inflammatory without reprisals, or its been folks posting in support of a comment made by someone trying to lend credibility to the other.  Several of those that have been accused have been outed by Ogmuk as doing exactly as accused.  You can't really consider it a witchhunt when the accused is convicted and/or confesses.  And it is relevant that others have made the same accusation, as it suggests its not paranoia but an actual condition.<br>
<br>
4.  Significant evidence points to Mors = Ibiar.  a.  The &quot;population control&quot; comment was made by him in DL.  b.  The nick's description is identical between the two accounts.  c.  Ibiar has rationalized and justified Mors statements on more than one occasion in this thread.  d.  EZBoard isn't limited to EQ, so the fact that the Mors account was allegedly created before Ibiar started playing is not persuasive.  e.  Zen doesn't know the IP details of Mors account, so his insider info isn't meaningful, and easily masked (especially by someone that used to work for an ISP).<br>
<br>
5.  Fine, you are all bent that I thought Mors was Ibiar.  I have now come to the conclusion that it is unlikely.  Still possible, but unlikely.  Frankly, its irrelevant to any of the things I've said about Ibiar or y'all.  It shows poor judgment on your part not to distance yourselves from his comments in your first posts rather than running over to defend him.  Any guild that would keep him as an officer is not a guild with which most folks would want to associate.<br>
<br>
6.  As for name-calling, whatever.  How can you &quot;stoop&quot; to my level by doing something I haven't.  Knights of Wackiness sorta had a ring to it and a decent way of grouping you and Zen together to respond to your &quot;defense&quot; of Ibiar and is hardly name-calling.  If you think that was a flame, then you are WAY too sensitive and should go back to hiding in the little corner y'all have created for yourselves.  As the two of you are leaders of the guild, it seemed appropriate, too.  I called Mors a pinhead regarding his Pearl Harbor and other analogies.  Haven't called anyone else a name.  Not my style.  I've labelled actions as foolish, but that's not the same thing.<br>
<br>
P.S.  I like your pic.  It's pretty funny/clever.  Zen's sig quote is good, too.  Too bad my first contact with you folks was over the idiotic things being said by Ibiar and Umbrae. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <br><font color=#E9D756>- </font><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/bemarr>Erollisi Marr, The Queen of Love</a><font color=#E9D756> - </font><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18>America Under Attack</a> <font color=#E9D756> - </font> <br>
