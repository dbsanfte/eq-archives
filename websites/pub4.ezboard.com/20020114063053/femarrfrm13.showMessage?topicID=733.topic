Fellow Norrathians,<br>
<br>
I would like to begin by extending my deepest thanks to the many people who shoed up for this raid.  Most of the people who came, whether they went up or not handled themselves maturely and admirably and for this I am thankful.  You all make it worthwhile.<br>
<br>
The vast majority of folks who went showed poise, sportsmanship, and a willingness to work in a team, and for this I am very happy and thankful.  Whatever problems we faced, we got over them and I didn't have to chew anyone out.  This is a <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> big deal</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> in a pickup raid with the raw numbers of attendees that we had.  People kept their smiles on their faces and pushed forward, and took responsibility for managing their own stress and mood.  I am very very impressed by this.  Yes, everyone gets into a bad mood sometimes, or gets stressed or impatient or what have you.  In my mind, taking responsibility for this yourself without trying to pass the buck off on someone else is key.  I saw a lot of people do that, and I'm glad.<br>
<br>
We had a difficult break-in, which was caused by three main factors in my mind.  Our raw large numbers, inexperience in the Plane of Hate, and the effects of level and aggro radius played a huge part in this.<br>
<br>
We got our casters out into chat, and opted to drag corpses to SW for a rebuild.  I did, in the end, opt not to have 8 groups break for base camp and run to a place where they did not know where to go.  Rogues, Monks, and SK did their jobs superbly, staying alive and getting people where they needed to be.  The clerics logged in one by one, and the rogues played traffic cop to get them through to base camp.  We got 2 clerics through to get the raid on its feet in this manner.<br>
<br>
With us in place, we got reinforcements (and one straggler group) through to base camp with the invite/CotH method which worked well with Ilsidar and Aalthenae running the summoning line.  To our fortune, all reinforcements that came up had some Hate experience, and knew how and when to get summoned through or run toward camp without training.<br>
<br>
We began our battle from West Wall camp, clearing the surround houses and securing the floor.  There was a lot of learning curve in terms of mob positioning and managing second floor aggro.  Overall the team did well, with the experienced hands showing patience with the less experienced ones.<br>
<br>
From my view in pull group, we started to get a groove going after setting up at base camp.  We had a couple of false starts with over-pull as folks figured out aggro and pathing.  This is the price of learning, I fear.<br>
<br>
Due to lack of crowd control power, we did not switch to an off-tank strategy and instead opted to pull mezzable multis to camp, splitting single on unmezzables and nameds.  At this time we started to hit a groove as folks settled in.  Everyone showed great poise as folks learned their places.<br>
<br>
We brought down Mistress of Scorn, Avatar of Abhorrence, Grandmaster R'Tal, Coercer T'vala, Lord of Loathing, and Evangelist of Hate (by accident) over the course of the raid.  A job well done by all.<br>
<br>
We halted the raid as we were splitting off the guards of the Maestro of Rancor, we almost had him alone for the battle.  It was a heartbreaker of sorts, but everyone had kept it together and rolling for so long and folks were simply tired.<br>
<br>
I have high hopes that the people who attended last night's raid will be able to hit the ground running next time.<br>
<br>
As a member of the EMarr community, I hope to see more pick-up raid leaders help people learn the ropes on raids such as these.  Myself, I hope to see these people again and see us hit the ground running on the next Hate raid I am on (in whatever capacity).<br>
<br>
Pragmatically, I see several places where we could have saved time and pushed further.  If we could have counted on an orderly run for base camp and camp-out to clear aggro, we would have shaved off three hours.  If everyone already had knowledge of positioning themselves and the mobs, we could have avoided some pulls-gone-wild and shaved off two more.  If the timing was tighter, we would not have needed as many replacements, and we could have saved another hour.  If not for the large turnout and the group selections needed with 64 people LFG in zone, we could have shaved off two hours.  The learning curve was 2/3rds of the time we spent there.  Shave off the learning curve, and I see potential for some good tight raids.<br>
<br>
People need to learn somehow, and more often than not it is by the patience, teamwork, and cohesiveness of a team.  I hope to see more people put things like this together.<br>
<br>
Everyone knew what we were heading into, and again I applaud the poise that people showed.<br>

<!--EZCODE HTML START--> <HR><!--EZCODE HTML END--><br>
<br>
Obviously, there is a huge sign-up for this raid.  Because of this, please be prepared with your best sense of team spirit as we go into what is certain to be an interesting and likely larger-than-usual raid.<br>
<br>
If you are present for the muster, but can come up later in the evening for reinforcement when we start to lose some of the starting line-up, please let me know.  This has a chance of being a nice long raid, and a TON of fun for all participating.<br>
<br>
The goal here is teamwork.  Plain and simple.  Hate has been sparesely raided by pick-up in recent times.  If everyone on the team works well and gets the knowledge they need, then we can look forward to more Hate pick-up raids, which is good for all the smaller guilds and un-guilded of EMarr.<br>
<br>
Please leave selfishness on Earth, and bring your best sense of chivalry with you to Norrath.<br>
<br>
We are short on enchanters and wizards.  We could use more of these.  I will do shuffling of the starting lineup as appropriate.<br>
<br>
See you tomorrow!<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE HTML START-->  <HR><!--EZCODE HTML END--><br>
Fellow Raiders,<br>
<br>
Attached are selected (and in some cases edited) excerpts from our guild message board, to help outline some of our strategies for tomorrow:<br>
<br>
As you all know, this is a pick-up raid we're embarking on. Since this is the case, you can expect muster to take quite a while. Although I have taken notes and other such advance planning, the tale of who actually shows is yet untold. Shuffling, group re-ordering, and such will take place on the spot, and this can be very time-consuming. Keep chipper!<br>
<br>
There are some precautions you can take beforehand. I highly recommend buying yourself a coffin or two and muling it on one of your subs/alts. Parking the sub/alt at the South Ro spire is a good idea. Should it be necessary to summon corpses, you will already be there to give coffins to the necromancer/shadowknight as they prepare to port up.<br>
<br>
[...]<br>
<br>
Tactically, this presents an issue. Even with our large headcount, a &quot;jailbreak&quot; break-in is not possible. Jailbreaking is when you zone in and fight your way to camp. We cannot jailbreak because we can only port up one group at a time.<br>
<br>
Breaking Hate can be a very very very difficult, nasty, and time-consuming business. Since we can only port up one group at a time, I will very likely call for the following strategy. Upon port-in, pure casters (especially clerics) are to /q. Tank classes will stay to buy them time, and die if necessary.<br>
<br>
Let me explain /q. When you /q, you effectively go linkdead. This is not a guaranteed out! After /q, you are still around for 90 seconds or so. Your character goes into NPC mode, and is controlled by the server AI. If you are aggroe'd, you are not safe! You will continue to fight, the server will grant you good channeling and treat you as if you were an NPC. But if you are killed, you will find yourself at your bind point when you get back to the Character Select screen. This is where &quot;buying time&quot; comes in. Pure casters go /q on arrival to ensure their safety. If they are aggro'd, the tank classes will taunt the mob off you, leaving your LD character safe until the server clears it. The tank class may die in this attempt, but it's okay. If the casters are out safely, we can rez and rebuild.<br>
<br>
Why not camp? Sitting to camp makes you aggro bait, and you will likely not survive. Worse, if you decide to /q at this point, you are certainly aggro'd (if a mob hit you an interrupted your camp). If you /q on arrival, there is a chance that you were not aggro'd. And obviously, if you are not aggro when you LD, the mob ignores you.<br>
<br>
So again, what to do when you arrive. Pure casters /q on arrival. (Possible exception are necromancers who can FD). Monks FD on arrival. We need your eyes open to assess the situation at camp and decide when to give the all clear to log back in. Rogues, sneak/hide and go to SE corner (a no-pathing point), halfway up the wall but NO MORE THAN HALFWAY (I'll explain this later). Tanks, back up from the wall (you will arrive facing the north wall of the port-in spot) to the center of the room, be prepared to buy time for casters, and DO NOT SIT! Sitting increases your aggro radius, and may draw spawn from the houses nearby.<br>
<br>
When you are out, go to a chatroom and await for the all clear to log back in. If the chatroom is not made, make it. Use the name EMarr-Hate, password Inny. EQ Chat is entered from the Server Selection screen by hitting the Chat button which is second from the left at the bottom of the screen. Channels are made by typing #makechannel EMarr-Hate in the chat dialogue window.<br>
<br>
Higher level groups will port up first, as they have the smallest aggro radius (and therefore the greatest chance of getting their cleric camped out). All group should port-up with Invisibility on (not IU) as the mobs likeliest to be closest to port-in are mobs such as Abhorrents and Spite Golems which do not see invis.<br>
<br>
When all groups are up, I will give the all clear to login rez parties and prep the raid. This may mean lots of rezzes. Again, DO NOT SIT! A rez party is generally composed of Clerics, Bards, Enchanters, Necros, Druids, Shamen, Magicians. Since medding is not possible, the bards sing mana, the chanters give crack, the necros twitch, the magicians summon mod rods, druids and shamen heal while clerics rez.<br>
<br>
When everyone is up, give out full buffs. Group buffs are best, and at this time unless you have some special reason, you need not give expensive buffs that cost gems.<br>
<br>
Pulls will begin to the port-in house to clear the area to SW camp.<br>
<br>
Before I go any further, you should have the following maps printed and available for your use:<br>
www.eqmaps.com/m2/hateplane2.jpg<br>
www.eqmaps.com/m2/hate_2nd_floor.jpg<br>
<br>
Due to the size of the raid party and the raw number of first-timers, I will most likely not call for a run to camp. Let me explain this a bit.<br>
<br>
The zonewalls of the first floor of Hate are inclined at a 45 degree angle. If you walk too close to the floor, you run the risk of drawing aggro, especially from the South Patrol Route (which I call SPR). If you walk too high up the wall, you run the risk of drawing second floor aggro. This creates lots of weird stuff. For one, you may be summoned by a second floor mob and killed, leaving your corpse on the second floor. This would suck. For another you may get aggro, not be aware of it, and inadvertently train whoever you walk to.<br>
<br>
South Patrol Route has several see-invis mobs that path it, and you can't stack Invisibility and Invisibility to Undead. That makes it a bad place for a rogue to have to navigate. And the monk/sk FD and drag can be very slow (given the fact that several SPR mobs can harmtouch). For the benefit of the raid party, I will very likely decide against taking that risk when /q and reforming is an option.<br>
<br>
Spawntime on Patrol Routes is 2 hours. Spawntime for static mobs is 8 hours. The pull team will clear the way for a safe run to SW camp. We will take this as it comes.<br>
<br>
A special note for the SW corner. If you touch the floor, you will set off an imp trap. A nice big row of imps will spawn there, so don't do it.<br>
<br>
From SW corner we will clear the westwall houses and the rest of the south part of the zone (including any SPR repops). Following this, we will clear the Organ Hall. If Maestro of Rancor is up, this may be a nice challenge, as Maestro has four guards surrounding him. This is some very challenging pulling.<br>
<br>
[...]<br>
<br>
I will very likely opt to let the raid get it's groove going before I try anything particularly creative. This means waiting a couple of engagements to see how folks perform.<br>
<br>
My ideal strategy is to setup an off-tanking strategy. This means faster clear through multiple pulls. I will set an MA and SA for one set of groups, and an MA and SA for another set. If the teamwork is there and the crowd-controllers (enchanters and bards) are alert and on-the-ball, I'll setup to bring several mobs to camp at once. Each set of group will target and assist on their MA, and we'll get the job done faster that way.<br>
<br>
[...]<br>
<br>
/shout channel will be used by me, second-in-command, pullers, and MA/SA only. Do NOT engage battle until MA has shouted INC. They may be switching targets, building aggro, or performing tag, or what-have-you. Be patient, but be alert!<br>
<br>
/ooc channel is to be used for info messages. This means mez messages, charm messages, and in mini-boss battles CH and Rune messages.<br>
<br>
/auction is to be used for loot and random. Salenie Silkweaver will be handling this. Group leaders are to masterloot, and announce drops to Salenie to manage.<br>
<br>
<br>
It is my hope that this info is of help.  See you all tomorrow,<br>
Theo<br>

<br>
It seems to me that a bunch of folks are clamouring for Plane of Hate.  Well, I only go to Hate under Lady Siilverain; but I'm jonesing to go there too.  Lady Siilverain has been very busy of late, alas.<br>
<br>
It also occurs to me that there may indeed be enough interest among US and Asia players to do a weeknight raid, factoring in timezones and whatnot.<br>
<br>
That said, please meet for muster at the Southern Desert of Ro Wizard Spire, anon/role off, lfg on at:<br>
<br>
Tuesday, November 13th US (Wed Nov 14 Europe/Asia)<br>
07:00pm US Pacific<br>
08:00pm US Mountain<br>
09:00pm US Central<br>
10:00pm US Eastern<br>
03:00am Greenwich Mean Time<br>
04:00am Central Europe<br>
11:00am Asia (UTC+08:00)<br>
<br>
There is no set time limit on the raid.  If we muster enough for the raid, we will proceed and continue until we lose critical mass.  Please be advised that for several of your fellow raiders, the things they need most are on the second floor, which requires a commitment of time and focus to get to.  In courtesy, I must ask that all raiders be able to devote at least 3 hours to the raid.  When you must go, please do us the courtesy of trying to find a replacement for you.<br>
<br>
I will shoulder the expense of Fulligan's Soulstone of Innoruuk.  I would appreciate if everyone would bring donations for Peridots.<br>
<br>
Please be advised, I will not send groups up unless we have enough heads, classes, and levels to safely conduct the raid.  Additionally, I will select people according to level/class/reputation to ensure the raid's success.  If I post an initial list and you do not find yourself on it, I would advise you to come to the muster if you are interested in joining.  The roster for a pick-up raid is often dynamic.  Such is the way of pick-up raids, I fear.<br>
