The intent of this thread was to pool a little of the knowledge I have gained in my 2+ years of tanking. Please feel free to add anything you feel would be informative. I hope that this post will be helpfull to younger warriors, and maybe even some veteran warriors out there who may have missed a trick or two along the way. I look forward to seeing others tips and tricks in case this veteran warrior missed something as well.<br><br><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>   <!--EZCODE CENTER START--><center>   **Gear**</center><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>The mainstay of any warrior is proper gear. Before we get into that lets review a few accepted rules regarding Stats, AC, and Hit points.<br><br><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>   <!--EZCODE CENTER START--><center>   1 STA = 6 HP<br>1 AC = 7 HP<br>2 AGI = 1AC</center><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br><br>Using the above rules when selecting gear, make sure for instance, that Enamelled Black Breastplate really is better than that Crafted Breast Plate. Believe it or not, the Crafted is better. Matter of fact its hard to find better till you start going to the Plane of Hate and begin collecting Indicolite. While crafted may look newb, It is excellent gear. I will be dealing with maximizing efficiency in this post, not making recomendations on fashion. Fashion and warriors dont mix.  <br><br>While these rules only become 100% true at level 60, following them throughout your characters career is a great way to maximize your Sta, Agi, AC, and HP's. Why only these 4? Because during the creation of your character you should have ensured the following. Make sure your base AGI was 75 or higher. If you didnt you'd have a serious AC penalty. Make sure you put as many points into Sta as you are allowed. Reason being HP's equal life in the warrior game. If you have points after that I would reccomend putting them into Dexterity. Over 100 dexterity creates a measurable increase in proc's from weapons. &quot;But Yayger! Why not STR oh white bearded barbarian!?!&quot; Simple. The game has so much equipment that grants the wearer str, that you should put what few starting points you have into statistics that harder to come by. As an example, I put all my bonus points in Sta, and Dexterity when I started my character. Today I Have 239str(self buffed with cobalt boots) and 255sta. My base HP's without buffs is 4010.<br>At level 60, with full raid buffs I have 5865hp's<br><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=7516">www.magelo.com/eq_view_pr...l?num=7516</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br><br>With all of that in mind here is a gear set I recommend to anyone pre 46. By obtaining these items as you level you will minimize the cost of buying them on the open market. Some things are harder to aquire but easily purchased and should be the things you save your plat for. Ive marked those items with a &quot; * &quot;.<br><br>Crafted Breastplate <br>Crafted Arms <br>Crafted Legs <br>Crafted Boots <br>Crafted Gloves <br>Crafted Bracers <br>(Note on the crafted: Its been awhile since I quested this stuff, but it is easily purchased and fairly cheap)<br><br>Rygorr Collar <br>Orc fang earingx2<br>Dented Brass mask or Crystal Eyes *<br>Crested Spaulders<br>Straw Spun Belt<br>Pair of Velium Fire Opal rings *<br><br>There is also a good way to obtain armor that in some case's is as good as or better than Indicolite armor, at a really low level. Certain Dorfs in Thurgadin B drop Royal frosted velium. Often you can find high level characters there killing the Dorfs for faction and exp. Be polite with the group leader and he may let you loot the armor. Similarly, these same high levels often leave the weaponry and minor items behind on the Dorfs. Looting and selling these items is a good way to generate funds. <br>(As I work on this post Ill expand this section with stats and links to locations and quests)<br><br><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>   <!--EZCODE CENTER START--><center>   **Places To Level</center><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>This section is designed to give warriors a good Idea of where to hunt to gain experience as quickly as possible. A short rule of thumb, level on Antonica, Faydwer, and Odus till you cant level anymore. The highest level you can reach is 60 in the old world (killing bugs and bats in Solb) the following is a quick and dirty laundry list of places I hunted being a Barbarian. This list was also designed to keep you in the old world fighting relatively week monsters.<br><br>1-5 Halas newb area (There's a fairly simple quest that results in armor!!) <br>5-10 Blackburrow. Great place to level and learn the definition of the word &quot;TRAIN!!&quot; as it applies to EQ.<br>10-13 Kerra Isle in Erud's Crossing. Youll make alot of plat doing the Greater Lightstone quest. Bring plenty of bags!<br>13-24 Permafrost Keep<br>24-30 Runnyeye (this may have changed since Ive been there because of a revamp of the zone)<br>30-37 Temple of Cazic thule<br>37-48 Window room in SolB<br>48-52 Bats and Bugs in Solb<br><br>After tapping out the old world its time to move on to the new world's of Kunark, Velious, and soon Luclin.<br><br>Kunark is great for early to mid 50's. Karnor and Sebilis both offer great hunting opportunities. The Lake of Ill Omen is actually a great place to exp from levels 25 - 34. The Giant fort in the frontier mountains right next door will pick up where LoIO left off and carry you to your early 40's.<br><br>Velious is a bit different. Its a questing continent with lots of mean baddies and wide open zones. Velketor's Labyrinth(sp?) will take you from 52 to 60 easily, however this zone is usually very very crowded. The rygorr camp in Eastern Wastes has some very decent Experience as well as loot but is usually heavily camped. Dont attemp to party there till at least level 35.<br><br><br><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>   <!--EZCODE CENTER START--><center>   **Your role in the group**</center><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>Puller, tank, meatshield, manasponge, fatty. These are all words you will hear used to describe you, but what exactly is your job? Is it your Job to Dish out the damage? Actually no. While a fair amount of tanks are very well equipped to do this, dmg dealing is secondary to our main purpose. Taking Damage!! To this end we are the most heavily armored, and have the most HP's vs other class's in the game.<br><br>Your mantra should be: Agro Agro Agro<br>Mainting agro on the mob is very simple yet something that it only seems a few tanks know how to do.<br>Create and place these hotkeys in hotkey setup.<br>1. Bash or Kick (there is a rumor Bash creates more agro but this is unconfirmed)<br>2. Taunt (duh!)<br>3. Disarm (whether the mob is armed or not, this will create agro)<br>4. Beg (yes this to creates agro but may become useless depending on what your fighting and how developed your beg skill becomes)<br>Once these keys are setup, USE them on every mob as often as possible.<br><br>Posistioning is key as well. Be as close to the mob as possible and always be on its frontside. Maneuver the mob using your agro so that others can do their job as well. Trust me, it will make for very happy Rogues.<br><br>Speaking of Rogues, you need to keep these damage dealers in mind while fighting mobs. Keeping a Mobs back against a wall does rogues absolutely no good. Position yourself so that the mob's back is easily reachable by a Rogue and you will be blessed with many years of happy exp groups.<br><br>Pulling is another &quot;talent&quot; we have. get to learn the area you are pulling. Know what spawns where and what the spawn times are. Go buy a $5 dollar egg timer so you know when your pull cycle begins again. Ideally however, someone else should be pulling if you want to maximize experience, such that as one mob falls the next mob is incoming.<br><br><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>   <!--EZCODE CENTER START--><center>   **Our Skills In a Nutshell</center><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>Bash: We all have it. Easier to use for some than it is for others. Ogre's, Troll's and Barbarian's get a sub skill of bash called slam which is just the ability to bash without a shield (cuz we so big and strong, and dumb). There is whats known as the ghetto bash. I became familiar with this on my first attempt at a tank. I created a Dorf tank many moons ago. He's in retirement in Riverale now living it up with the H-Babes. Its simple really. Put Bash in a hotkey and when you need to Swap a shield into your secondary slot, hit bash, and put your weapon back till next cycle. I know a few warriors that have this down to an art.<br><br>Kick: We all have it. I preferred bash till level 55 since it gave me the stun ability on casters, but I always had two hotkey setups with the only difference being that one had bash and one had kick. This way I could easily switch my attack style on non-casters and keep my skill level in both up.<br><br>1hs: Absolutely posistivly keep this skill maxed at all times. This will be your primary damage dealing skill.<br><br>1hb: Try and keep this skill maxed.<br><br>1hp: Nice but not necessary. This skill cpas 10 points lower than 1hb or 1hs. Interestingly enough 2hp is tied directly to this skill.<br><br>2hs: Try and keep this skill maxed. 2hs, with recent change's, has become a viable damage dealing skill, even in the high end game.<br><br>2hb: My 2hb skill level is 2 <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br><br>Archery: You'll never be as good as a ranger but you can get damn close. Plus this skill is excellent for pulling mobs. If you are a regular puller using bows and arrows you should have no problem keeping this skill up.<br><br> <p><p align="center"><embed name="Yaygersig" src="http://pages.sbcglobal.net/evscott/external/Yaygersig.swf" quality="high" bgcolor="#666666"    width="260" height="77"    type="application/x-shockwave-flash"    pluginspage="http://www.macromedia.com/shockwave/download/index.cgi?P1_Prod_Version=ShockwaveFlash">  </embed></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uyayger.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Yayger</A> at: 10/19/01 8:36:19 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ubouldor.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bouldor</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>h0x0r!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(10/19/01 11:34:06 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumwarrior.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=412.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Warrior's 101 and Beyond v0.2 a work in progress</span><hr size=1> Great guide..It is coming along really nicely.<br><br>I have a suggestion: I would be interested in reading your opinion (and that of others) on the various warrior discs..I.E. what tactics one can use to maximize the various discs' value, when they should be used, and which ones are total crap..<br><br>/salute <p><img src="http://www.enjoyer.com/barrel.gif" width="270" height="150" border="0">52nd Champion</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/utsuru.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tsuru</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>h0x0r!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(10/19/01 11:43:25 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumwarrior.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=412.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Warrior's 101 and Beyond v0.2 a work in progress</span><hr size=1> I try to keep my discipline open, in case i need an emergency /di def, but when i'm bored i use fellstrike(56?57?) for extra damage, and i use evasive when doing a dangerous run through mobs or something. aggressive(60) is useful on vulak or disgustingly high hp mobs; i used it a few times on the enraged golem in fear. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ujugernautoflanys.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Jugernaut of Lanys</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I live here.... get out.</span><br> <font color=#000033>(10/19/01 11:54:43 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumwarrior.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=412.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.psifre.com/Jugernaut/Anim-jug.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Warrior's 101 and Beyond v0.2 a work in progress</span><hr size=1> My take on Discs, heh<br><br>Resistant : Crap : Only usefull if you don't have resist gear or something<br><br>Fearless : Crap : Lasts way to short of a period to be of any real use<br><br>Evasive : Crap : Only usefull if your pulling a train to zone<br><br>Charge : Crap : If the mob is that hard to hit, why are you fighting him?<br><br>Mightystrike : Usefull : But Really only usefull on mobs with around 32k dmg on a raid, You can do extremly heavy damage when your in Bazerker mode, and cripping for extreme amounts of dmg.  But useless agains the ubermobs of velious, with upward of 300khp, where, if your in crip mode, your probably a second away from death.<br><br>Defensive : Very Usefull : This will be your bread and butter, this is really the only disc that counts.  You take less damage, and you still keep taunt, it's that simple.<br><br>Furious : Usefull : against certain mobs, it's necessary to keep aggro while noone else is hitting the mob, and not needing complete heals out the ying yang.  This allows you to start a fight and gain enough aggro to keep the mob centered on you, while the rest of the team holds off until it wears off, then come in without worry of it ping ponging half as much.  Mostly a tactic used against mobs like Venril Sather, and The ScaleKeeper in the hole.<br><br><br>Precision : Utter Crap : If the mob has a better chance of hitting you, all it's gonna do is make you die faster, which goes against all that which we warriors stand for.  Our usefullness depends on one thing, letting the clerics have enough time to heal us before we die.<br><br>Fellstrike : Usefull : If you are dealing with a 32khp mob, it allows you to do max damage, without having to get into bezerker to see true damage, unlike Mightystrike. On Velious uber mobs, though, it's still crap, heh.<br><br>Fortitude : Crap : Only usefull if your training Sontalak to ToV, heh.  Utter crap if on raid, or grouped, if your using this to save your life in a group, you should have used Defensive instead, heh.<br><br>Aggressive : Crap Crap Crap : Our mission in life is to take dmg, not do dmg, why aren't you using Defensive? heh.

Too short to be of much use but might as well use this or Resistant on Naggy raids and such.<br><br><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> LEVEL 52: THE DISCIPLINE OF EVASIVE</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>Bad - You'll only use this when you need to tank until you ding 55 and get tha vastly superior Defensive<br><br><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> LEVEL 53: THE DISCIPLINE OF CHARGE</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>Bad - For those raids where you're not gonna be doing any tanking (cuz there's lots of much higher warriors on the raid than you).  Might as well use this till 54<br><br><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> LEVEL 54: THE DISCIPLINE OF MIGHTY STRIKE</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>Good - Most effective when you are berserk.  I still use this quite a bit, even at 60.  You'll use this on high regen mobs where fast damage is of the essence, at least till 58<br><br><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> LEVEL 55: THE DISCIPLINE OF DEFENSIVE</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>Ub3r!!! - Our class defining disc.  Learn it, love it, because you will use this more than any other disc.  For 3 min you are a much better thank than you already are.  Always use this when I am main tank on an ubermob (with a few rare exceptions).<br><br><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> LEVEL 56: THE DISCIPLINE OF FURIOUS</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>Good - This is the one I use when I am not using Defensive.  It's useful against mobs who have a proc a lot worse than their melee damage (for example VS).  A mob can only proc if it lands a hit ... with this it won't be landing any so it won't proc.  Also remember to equip a nice damage 2H weapon if you can before activating this ... you'll do quite a bit of extra damage since you'll just hit once for every time the mob tries to hit you (regardless of your weapon's delay).  Also good for saving your butt when the cleric hasn't been paying attention and starts that CH late.  It lasts 9 sec so if you react quick it will keep you alive long enough for that CH to land.<br><br><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> LEVEL 57: THE DISCIPLINE OF PRECISION</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>Bad - This only comes in handy on high HP mobs (&gt;32k) and on which you are not tanking.  Thing is unless you are in a high-end guild filled with warriors higher than you, by this time you will be tanking on raids.  I've never parsed it, but I expect on a 3+ min fight it will add more damage than using Mightystrike<br><br><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> LEVEL 58: THE DISCIPLINE OF FELL STRIKE</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>Ok - An alternative to Mightystrike for high regen mobs.  Has the advantage of not needing to be berserk to get the most damage out of it.<br><br><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> LEVEL 59: THE DISCIPLINE OF FORTITUDE</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>Bad - Unlike Furious this protects you from attacks from any direction (including back), but it doesn't do any damage to mobs (no ripostieing).  Never seen much use in this except perhaps if you're running to zone with a nasty train on you or something like that.<br><br><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> LEVEL 60: THE DISCIPLINE OF AGGRESSIVE</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>Bad (would be Ok, but too late to be of any use) - Would be a nice discipline to use on high HP mobs on which you aren't tanking ...  But by level 60 you will very likely be tanking on any such mob. <p><a href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/players/view_profile.asp?Id=18807" target="CRProfile" alt="Yunna's Profile" title="Yunna's Profile"><img src="http://24.101.174.177/scripts/rsig/yunnasig.php" border="0" alt=""></a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ucandiemandarkryder.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Candieman Darkryder</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I live here.... get out.</span><br> <font color=#000033>(1/17/02 10:26:06 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumwarrior.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=412.topic&index=11>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.castletrash.com/animation/plani131.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Warrior's 101 and Beyond v0.2 a work in progress</span><hr size=1> um yunna...all furious is a auto reposte, VS procs still do land on you *if your not runed*, at least that is what i have always been told and using it, maybe i just never noticed.<br><br><br>&lt;------its about time...now get out i live here. <p><left><img src="http://watchersrealm.virtualave.net/eq_sigs/eq_sig_stwc.jpg"></left><br><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=71256">Solanthious</a>-60 Warlord<br><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=71260">Inshackles</a>-16 Enchanter</p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ucandiemandarkryder.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Candieman Darkryder</A> at: 1/17/02 10:28:30 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ufelwan1.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Felwan1</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Cyber Pimp</span><br> <font color=#000033>(1/18/02 11:23:32 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumwarrior.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=412.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Nope</span><hr size=1> No, the procs do not land on you because to land a proc on you, he needs to hit you, he can't hit you when you riposte every attack.
