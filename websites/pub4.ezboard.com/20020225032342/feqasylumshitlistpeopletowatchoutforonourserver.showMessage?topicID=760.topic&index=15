Let's not let this get off track.  Vooddu was the ass here, not Jayes, nor his girlfriend.<br>
I have known Jayes for a long time in this game and he is a great guy.  I have never seen him ever cheat anyone.  And he has been more than generous with several of his guildmates, myself included.  I know because for a while I was his GL and we were also in another guild together.<br>
He posted here for one reason, so his RL girlfriend wouldn't get dissed.  He doesn't owe anyone else anything.<br>
Jayes is solid.  So let's not play the &quot;guilt by association&quot; game.  I am sure we have all have had RL friends that could be assholes sometimes.  That is just how life is.  Though I do hope these aren't the kind of idiots he continues to hang around with in RL.<br>
So let's get back to Vooddu.  What do we do with Vooddu?<br>
I can tell you what my guild and I will do.  What, you need a rez?  Sorry, we don't rez thieving asses.  Is that Vooddu running by with a train behind him?  Well, I'll wave and hope he never makes it to the zoneline.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   And he has one less guild he will ever be able to group with or join on raids.<br>
Paybacks can be a real bitch, and I'M THE BITCH!!!<br>

<br>
It's like, in reality, the cops wouldn't buy that for a second if they were trying to figure out some case.  &quot;Oh yeah, I can help you figure it all out, but the guys a friend of mine so I ain't gonna say anything, don't wanna rat him out, ya know?&quot; - - they'd throw you in jail so fast if you did that on the exact same charges your friend would face.  Granted, this isn't real life, but the fact is that you should still do the right thing.  <br>
<br>
Your friend screwed up, you've got a chance to help solve it.  If you say nothing, I think both you and Vooddu will have your reps going down the tubes honestly bro, and I didn't want to do anything against you, it was you who spoke out and said &quot;Yeah, I know him, he's a real life&quot; and said you've got some info on his alts and guild and whatnot.  If you don't wanna post that info here, that's fine.  Send me a tell in-game, clear it up that way or whatnot, then I'll come here and clear your name, say you did the right thing and your rep ain't gonna be trashed.<br>
<br>
I'm sorry if I sound like the one threatining you here, because I ain't.  It's just a nasty fact of what will happen if you don't say anything. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/utellwar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>TellWar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I live here.... get out.</span><br> <font color=#000033>(2/7/02 9:50:30 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=760.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Vooddu - thief and liar</span><hr size=1> Jayes is a fucking ASS, anyone that would stand by a thieving piece of shit deserves the shit that gets wiped off on  them...<br>

Vooddu is the thief, correct, not Jayes?  Why the hell is everyone getting on Jayes' case because he wont give his friend up?  <br>
<br>
If put in this same situation I am pretty sure that almost nobody would tattle on a real life friend within a gaming environment.  The proper way for Jayes to handle this would be for him to try and persuade Vooddu to give the money back on his own.  When giving up the names of the alts, Jayes would be putting people he doesnt even know in front of his RL friend.<br>
<br>
This poor bastard posts on this board to try and clear his girlfriend's name and then all of you put him in a very precarious position.  Trying to make him turn on his real life friend is not the right thing to do.  Instead of fucking flaming the poor guy, maybe you should ask him to try and persuade his friend to give the money back.  <br>
<br>
I'm sure all of you have friends who have done some things you arent proud of, this doesnt make you to blame.  Even if nothing comes of this and Gayla never hears from Vooddu again, Jayes should not be thought of in any less of a way.  There is no fucking reason to fucking destroy a player's reputation based on the actions of someone he knows in RL.  <br>

If you are not playing this for that, you just as well go play solitaire. <br>

Its not just that he wont turn his friend in, by his words he finds what happend to be funny.  He assassinated his own character with that post, no body is attacking him he made a public definition of his character.<br>
<br>
I wont trust that threesome at all, I think they should rethink what they are saying.  Instead of helping this crime succeed, they should convince thier friend to right this.  If he doesnt, they should reconsider thier eq relationship with him.<br>
<br>
Condoning these actions, assisting these actions, and sheltering the culprit shine very poorly for you.  Saying it was funny has to be the one of the worst things this jayes guy said, if I were you I would do what jinin said.  Convince your boy to come clean, it will clean everything up real quick. <p><a href="mailto:dreamingwolfmail@home.com"><img src="http://www.fortunecity.com/bennyhills/flower/152/dwsig.gif" border="0"></a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uzeffansilvershield.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Zeffan Silvershield</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>n00b!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(2/8/02 7:40:52 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=760.topic&index=25>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Vooddu - thief and liar</span><hr size=1> /agree above<br>

Lanys, and other servers, have problems with dishonest people making the game less enjoyable for the general populous.  So, in my eyes, you are either part of the solution or part of the problem.  Not making an attempt to help a friend see the error of his ways (or assisting others in holding him responsible) places you in the latter group, friend.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
