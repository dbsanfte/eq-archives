A bunch of pointless bickering with no attempt at resolution is about the only thing I see going on here.<br>
<br>
To the point......maybe someday I will gather enough people to take down VS......maybe I never will be able to.....and MAYBE I'll never really care.  But, let me say this &lt;ONCE&gt;......if indeed I get people to the place and time to kill VS, it will be without regard to any so-called &quot;rotation&quot;.  The whole idea of a rotation might be a noble goal, but the actual in-game implementation is nothing more than a sham that starts more arguments than it prevents.  In the early days of Emarr, this was never a problem (or at least not as big a problem) becuase there were only a few guilds that could muster the necessary firepower to drop VS.  Nowdays......too many guilds.....too few VS's.<br>
<br>
I look forward to the day when &quot;UBERGUILDMEMBER_001&quot; sends me a /tell whining &quot;Hey.....I'm a member of UBERGUILD_001 and you just killed VS when it was our turn!&quot;.  My response will be.....&quot;SO?&quot;.<br>

<br>
It's not about Magister not being in the rotation.<br>
<br>
If Magister would have gotten there first and was prepping, then it's their VS and I bet UI would not have had a problem because hey, thats the way you get back into a rotation.  You kill VS before the other guild that he was up next for.<br>
<br>
NOTE : Dumbass's, that does not mean you run right over a guild that is obviously there prepping for him.  You know they are. And you pull him over them anyways and blatently KS.<br>
<br>
Kinda funny how some people (Koryo) thinks 14 people holding a spawn is ONLY valid when he's doing it.  If it's him holding a spawn he will send you tells whining about how it's so unfair becuase he was there first and how he would never do that.  Yet when it's the other way around his attitude is 'tough shit we are all here and ready, you aren't'.<br>

Yes, it sucks to have to wait a mont+ for another chance at a mob, but it prevents shit like this from happening more often.<br>
<br>
I'm pretty sure that most if not all of the guilds on the rotation got there the 'legit' way...Get set up in position and kill VS before the other guild got there.  Affliction got in in this manner...we waited for a patch day, made sure people were near KC prior to the patch, and mobilized as quickly as we could once the server came up.  I would postulate that nearly all of the guilds got into the rotation this way, rather than by asking for a spot back.  No one in the rotation has gotten upset about this AFAIK.  The guild may be a bit frustrated by having to wait, but nothing like what we've seen in this thread.<br>
<br>
If the rotation wasn't adhered to by the participating guilds, all it becomes is KS fest after KS fest as people charge to KC every time VS pops, which leads to even more bad blood between guilds and individuals.  Just take a look at all the shit that happens when Lodizal pops for an example of this.<br>

chiteng's bitterness predates da`kor, actually.<br>

I did read some of thals post. Kanya hit the nail on the head chit has been angery about stuff for longer than da`kor had the name da`kor. Hell I believe it started before the orignal da`kor were HoD (hands of destruction). It was a different time back then and people were different. And I agree with chit that when several members or combinations of members were not present on raids they ran smoother with a happier atmosphere or at least in my opinion. Its easy to give examples everyone has seen them and groups seem to get labeled by such indivuals. They are always the ones that HAVE to say something and always try to be in the spot light. Its sad but true takes only a few people to label the group.  They also feel the group NEEDS them when in actuality they are no more significant than that newbie that doesnt listen or follow instructions and cause about the same amount of problems as said newbie.<br>

Uber - (to be) petty, self-absorbed, greedy, and obnoxious towards others.<br>
<br>
Uber people often have no regard towards other people.  They take because they believe it is their right.  Any other attempt by a person who is not &quot;uber&quot; is considered a threat, and is dealt with immediately by them.  They survive only because the creatures known as newbies look up to them.  Anyone from the levels of 1-60 who are not associated with them are considered and used as toilet paper.  Do not expect to move any higher than an uber person.  They are currently at the top of the food chain.  They also don't mind flaunting this fact in the faces of other people.<br>

<br>
It's very simple.  You get a group of people together to kill VS.  You get to VS first and kill him.  You finish your epic.  <br>
<br>
Whether or not there is a rotation, you will have to beat someone else to killing VS.  At least with a rotation in place, you won't have to be EVERYBODY to him, only whoever's turn it is.  Do you really expect that the whole server just step aside and let you kill VS to finish your epic?  No one else has had that happen to them.  <br>
<br>
People whine about the rotation.  But, with no rotation, it becomes a race to VS when he pops and then people will whine about getting a chance to kill him.  Seems to me that the rotation is the lesser of two evils.<br>
<br>
It doesn't matter who you are.  It doesn't matter what guild you're in.  If you can get there first and kill VS, you're alright.  If not, try again later. <p><a href=http://www.afflictionguild.com/scripts/member.x?username=Carathos&charactername=Carathos>Carathos Ollathir<BR><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/bthedruidsgrove> 60th Druid<BR> <a href=http://www.afflictionguild.com/>~Affliction~<BR>

The rotation is there to uphold some common courtesy (most of the time), and gives everyone a chance to do epics/get some legs.  My guess is you have no experience in the high end aspect of the game, so don't comment on something you know dick about.  Stick to your cold fusion bullshit. <p>Eurm Edgecrusher<BR>

<br>
lol why do all of you lie about your numbers so much?<br>
<br>
Go to your own damn web page... www.eqmagister.com<br>
<br>
You have <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> 41</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> listed... That is 28% more than you claim to have. And that doesn't even count whoever you happen to have on trial right now.<br>
<br>
You guys need to have your heads examined about this numbers thing. I know you like to claim you do stuff with low numbers, but it is total bs. <p>tuan {cupcakes}<br>

Don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to flame anyone here... but WTF do you think is going to happen if there is no rotation?  Pickup groups and small guilds will be able to wander in to KC and whack VS whenever they feel ready?  Don't count on it.  Without a rotation, the same 4-5 or so guilds will be racing to kill that lizard every time he pops.  Those of you who are unguilded or in smaller/less raid oriented guilds at least have a chance now to beat the current rotation guild to the spawn or con them into giving up their place for you.  If the spawn was FFA, you'd be trying to beat Magister, MS, SF, DG, Affliction, the Japanese guilds, and god only knows who else EVERY SINGLE TIME VS SPAWNS.  Does that sound like a good deal to you?  I didn't think so.  Small guilds and independents get the better end of the deal with rotations, they aren't some diabolical scheme to favor the ubers.  If anything, FFA spawns favor the more uber.  Think about it for a minute.<br>
