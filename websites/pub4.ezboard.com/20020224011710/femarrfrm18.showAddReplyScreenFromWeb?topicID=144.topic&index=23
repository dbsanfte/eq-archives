<br>
And you already have given me a piece of your life,you said you have palestinian friends,which means you care about them and their family..good,but that is not reason enough.You posted it is &quot;close to home&quot; before,so IS your best friend palestinian? gotta be some reason why your so angry about this.<br>
<br>
As for me,i have a family of palestinians who the dad has been more of a father figure in my life than any other person to me( having been brought up by single mother) i have learned alot from him,and how to deal with life,all of whom i consider friends.That is my reasoning as to why i get pissed off at everything going on over in israel,why i keep track.<br>
<br>
If your whole posting is about islam,arabs hugging cause they are arabs,your a loser who needs to look around and see what people actually care about other people.And as for your iranian heritage,i am sorry all iranians get treated like bastards cause of the acts of the few,if it helps,i think iran is one of THE best countries in the world,number one education system in the world,where most get college level education,self sufficient(needing no help from any other nation on the planet).So for you to get all pissed off means something underlies this whole discussion for you..maybe your parents/grandparents did good in teaching you the need for hatred of jews,but if your gonna get so worked up,maybe you outta stop posting about israel/palestine state.<br>
<br>
i have responded in a semi-thought out way,i read your post,and your up to your old tricks of calling anyone who does not believe what you say &quot;fucker&quot; &quot;something about butt plugging&quot; &quot;and other rudities&quot; shows that you lack true insight into this whole situation,i can say that,because you have not ever posted anything other than what is the arab belief's,over,over,over,and over again.<br>

It's pretty obvious you are pro-Israel in this debate, but perhaps you can add some substance to the argument, rather then calling me a robot.  I am about as 'robotic' when it comes to Palestinian support as Jews are when it comes to Israeli support.<br>
<br>
They lost out on something they could have had Before the Common Era.  They think that gives them the right to have it now.  Pretty ignorant logic to me, but hey, its a debate.<br>

As I try to understand it from the perspectives of those with stronger connections to the issue than I, I have some questions (based of course on my personal though-process and experience).<br>
<br>
Please note, I am not justifying either side in my line of questioning.<br>
<br>
As an American (I am born of immigrants, but not my point right now; I state this to note and accept that I am raised multi-culturally), I have had both the necessity and the opportunity of dealing with multi-cultural habits/values/morality disputes all my life.  I say opportunity, because I believe you learn a lot about your fellow human beings this way, however uncomfortable or however much work it may be.<br>
<br>
I have made acquaintances, and yes I have made friends, with various people of various cultural/ethnic/spiritual/socio-political backgrounds.<br>
<br>
I have found that culturally, or perhaps a more accurate term to refer to a group of people is evading me at the moment, both Jews and Muslims seem to me to be more militant than many other cultures/ethnicities/whatever-the-right-word-is.<br>
<br>
I am not a history scholar, nor am I a complete ignoramous on the topic.  Let me repeat, I am not justifying or explaining why this is the case, nor am I stating that either has a &quot;right&quot; to be so.<br>
<br>
Nonetheless, it appears so to me.  That with the beauty of community (which every ethnic group in the US finds a way to share:  Chinatown, black neighborhood, white neighborhood, Little Italy, etc) also comes a tendency to band together both in good times and bad.<br>
<br>
A beautiful thing, I grant you.<br>
<br>
Yet, that same solidarity can and does lead a group of compatriots to incite themselves into indignation and uprising.<br>
<br>
Very much so the Hebrew and Islamic communities, I have noted.<br>
<br>
Now, putting aside the reasons why; I am looking for pure sociology here, not political history.....<br>
<br>
Does it really do that much good?  That kind of adamant opposition which leads to antipathy to disdain to hate is extraordinarily powerful.  The fine line from civilized disagreement to balls-out passion is easily crossed.  At some point, that kind of energy requires extraordinary commitment, and can unlock frighteningly strong energies in support of a purpose.<br>
<br>
Is it really productive that the commitment to an idea or ideal becomes violent?  Pragmatically now.  I'm not saying that it is or is not justified in the eyes of the one side or the other.  But is it really worth it, that particular methodology?  The methodology of rage, is what I am referring to.<br>
<br>
I'm not talking about a kid in school who gets picked on for years, and one day retaliates against his taunter with blows.  That's one on one, the dam of rage is opened and then it is closed.  Short term, small scale, over and done with.<br>
<br>
This issue involved entire communities, nations if you would.  Not a 30 minute affair of two men with pistols at ten paces.  We're talking about men, women, children, all committed as a community to an idea filled with such emotion that they will slaughter, yes they will kill.  And they are in such zeal that they will feel perfectly justified doing so, before, during, and after they do the deed.<br>
<br>
Just how practical is that, I wonder.<br>
<br>
I'm not saying that I know a better way.  I am asking this of those who themselves in their hearts are committed to these issues.<br>
<br>
What say you?<br>

Racists of any type like to say they are not racist. They use 'safe' terms to cover the racist beliefs they hold. Much like your anti-goverment one when all throughout the thread you have dripped scorn and hatred towards Americans and Israelis. How is this just anti-goverment feelings when you obviously hold contempt and anger towards anyone who might disagree with your outlook. <br>
<br>
You obviously are carrying a lot of hatred around inside of you and I can only suggest you seek some help with this issue and work on overcoming your dislike of americans/israelis as contrary to whatever belief you might hold, the majority of us don't have some secret plot against your or your people and we don't harbor some innate dislike of arabic races. If you think otherwise then you are categorizing a whole race and partaking in reverse-racism.<br>
<br>
You can feel free to pick apart my comments as you wish, but understand that as long as you carry this anger inside of you you cannot effectively debate a position without people dismissing you in an offhand manner due to that anger. <p><small><br><br><br>Ægishjalm eg ber milli bruna mjer.<b> - Icelandic Chant</b></small></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uancientwalkeremarr.showPublicProfile?language=EN>AncientwalkerEmarr</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 45<br> <font color=#E9D756>(9/4/01 2:52:35 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=144.topic&index=44>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Interesting....</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> I meant to say: That's like telling 90 percent of the people ranting on these boards to stay out of the &quot;MS ksed phinny&quot; thread unless they were present in the zone.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Thats just plain silly. Of course it would be true if you thought the land was the palestinians. I think they have about as much right to the land, however, as a felon to vote. There can be compelling arguments made for either side. Both of which ignore crucial points in history. This was made abundantly clear when we had this discussion about a month ago. So why even continue? You will never think that Israel deserves the land and I think that Israel should kill every palestinian that looks at em funny. Neither of us will change their mind. So why not just drop it? Your inclusion of the United Nations evidence does nothing to sway anyone, as most people regard that body as a waste of space. <br>

We didn't take, we bought.  Problem was, the indians that sold it, didn't own it.  So who's teaching who the art of &quot;con&quot;??<br>
Don't know where you got that &quot;divine destiny&quot; thing... a Custer quote perhaps?? (see &quot;moron4&quot; below)<br>

UNTIL some beaurocratic moron came along and decided that, well, we need this area now, we'll give you this area over here, but you gotta move as of yesterday and you're only allowed to eat meat when we tell you and the rest of the time we'll tell you what we will and won't allow.  Then said moron would make all kinds of promises that the next moron wouldn't uphold and the Indians kept getting shafted because of it.  In the meantime, moron1 has returned to &quot;civilization&quot; (aka whatever political hub he hailed from) and tells everyone there overblown stories of what he had to go through to accomplish these things.  So while moron2 is trying to make himself look good and get things done, now enters moron3, who has no desire to go see for himself, takes the stories from moron1 as gospel and the difficulties from moron2 as &quot;THEY aren't doing what they promised&quot;, and, gee.... go figure, enter moron4 who gets to be some kind of hero because he made everything all better.  By simply killing everyone off.   And, during all this, you have the &quot;carpetbaggers&quot; going in and cheating the indians (and anyone else whose wallet they could get at), or getting them drunk to get something they want.<br>

I am, have been and probably always will be pro-native Americans (and I'm Canadian Indian/german).  And what we called &quot;uninhabited&quot;, so did they.  So it was a 6-to1, half dozen of the other deal.  What the indians DIDN'T expect however, was to have so many just keep showing up.  And by the time they did object, they were a little on the late side.  There were too many to just make the white man leave. And since so many had been born there, they had just as much right to be there as the indians did.<br>

Like it or not, &quot;Palestine&quot; (that wasn't it's name when this started) didn't care about that strip of land when the Jewish people moved there.  And, technically, this argument goes back a LOT farther than 1949.  The Islamics want the Hebrews gone.  But guess what?? That's never going to happen.  As far as that conference goes, think back (no, ya gotta think back farther than that ... ), the Hebrews were the slaves and &quot;second class citizens&quot; for a long time, but that was so long ago, it shouldn't make a difference.  They settled in a little patch of land long ago.  The Islamics drove them out, and they came back.  Both sides are right, and both sides are wrong.  And it's an argument that goes so far back that there's not another country in the world that has any business being in it.  And until BOTH sides can start teaching their children to stop hating, they will continue to fight because it's all they know.  Although, I do believe that teaching a child to fire a weapon is a bit on the extreme and see no way to change how much these people hate when they get it into their heads to do so. <p><Center><IMG SRC="http://www.lof.ukhq.co.uk/sigs/mastorm.jpg"><BR>
