''<br>
<br>
<br>
Its a bit involved so stick with me here.<br>
<br>
Dwarkarn aka Dork<br>
<br>
I dont know Dwarkarn in game, dont think I've ever met him so no problems there, however his personality drives him towards conflict (insert 20 examples of him admitting this) and he is of the opinion that if he shouts loud enough and long enough then people will back down.  He will rarely if ever attack the facts of a statement but rather make some derogatory mindless insult in an attempt to bait the other poster, he has no point to make and just posts to give him something to do.  Quite a wjile ago Dwarkarn mispelt his own name in his sig and I ribbed him constantly about it, of course he changed it fast but from that point on it became a sore point for him<br>
<br>
I have no problem with Aussies or anything like that and indeed the rare times a serious topic is raised on this board we have most often found ourselves in total agreement or at least he has disagreed in an adult manner.<br>
<br>
Simply put he posts to be an ass, as long as you understand that then its simple enough to laugh it off.  His recent stalking on the AB board is directly in line with his huge desire to score a point (in his mind) at any point.<br>
<br>
If you disagree with Dwarkarn, you are labelled delusional by him, its his defence mechanism.  Some people used to find him amusing (myself included at times) however people are now openly getting tired of his lack of anything nice to say and constant attention seeking.<br>
<br>
<br>
Chukzombi aka 'That @#%$' or 'Coco the Clown'<br>
<br>
Chuks a different case altogether.<br>
<br>
A logn time ago when this board was fairly new still, Chukzombi was by far (well maybe Gopher actually) the biggest trash talking @#%$ talker on it.  He did two things and two things only, he spouted endless mindles hatefilled drivel whilst managing to at all times kiss as much Da'Kor (our oldest and most succesful guild, now retired from EQ but some members are in Magister) ass as is humanly possible.<br>
<br>
Chuks number one aim was to be in the top guild (not in itself a bad goal) but sadly he was willing to sacrifice anythign and anyone to get there.<br>
<br>
Old guilds?  screw them<br>
Old friends?  screw them<br>
<br>
'Whatever it took' was Chuks motto and he finally suceeded after he dumped Umoja (another old guild consisting of many oldtime EQ players).<br>
<br>
Now Chuk had become (in his mind at least) Ubah! and while Da'Kor had a lot to teach him about being a shaman (he was merely average before then) he milked the ''My Guild is Da'kor'' thing as much as humanly possible.<br>
<br>
He was however only an occaisional poster as he was doubtless busy with his guild (and it was/is a good guild) but then fairly recently he started taking pot shots at me and posted an ongoing set of 'facts' which were all derogatory.<br>
<br>
I took note of what he was saying but did not respond to any of them until I felt the rope was logn enough....and then I posted each one of his statements, in full, along with a link or statement refuting them entirely and accused him of being a liar.  A long flame ensued but at the end of it Chuk admitted he had been wrong in what he had posted (on most points).<br>
<br>
He did not however apologise (he would lose too much face) but was extremely pissed off that quite a lot of people admitted and noted in that thread that yes, he had indeed been lying.  He also disparaged my old guild United Independant and got flamed hard for that in the same thread.  All in all not a nice experience for him and because of that he has gone out of his way to invent, snipe, take digs or anything he can to try and 'even the score'.  He claims to be unaffected but then spends a week cross server flaming which did nothing but make him look silly.<br>
<br>
Basically he is bitter and even posted recently that he would go to AB and give the other top guild there the strategy for the Ssra Emporer kill in order that they could kill it before my guild and 'deny' (sic) my guild the chance to go there. (hello reality coco).<br>
<br>
Thats Chukzombi, oh and before I forget, he is intensley disliked by a very large number of people on the server for his longstanding attitudes and Ubah opinion.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Chiteng aka the crusader or chitbong<br>
<br>
Chiteng is a moral crusader, he speaks his mind often and sometimes a little too often for the likes of some board residents.  He is a loyal and principled person and attempts to apply those principles to the situations that occur on this board.  This can come off as 'holier than thou' to some people and because Chit has a zeal (hence his nickname crusader, which btw he probably relishes) to leave no stone unturned in the quest for truth he has managed to piss off people who would rather that some things were left in the dark corners of EM history.<br>
<br>
He is also a loyal friend who I have asked on more than one occaision not to post on certain things (and occaisional TO post on certain things).<br>
<br>
<br>
Mitch aka Mitch the Bitch<br>
<br>
I speak my mind and call a spade a spade (or a tool in some peoples case), this does not go down so well sometimes and I also have a knack for actually remembering the things people said and did in the past in order to drag out this historical information all the better to illustrate their hypocrisy.  This of course is not populist work but hey, someone has to do it.<br>
<br>
I can (and do) post your run of the mill flames, your ''here is a lot of swearing'' flames, ''you are deluded'' flames (tx Dork) and especially like the ''here is why you are a fvckhead'' flames.<br>
<br>
I will manipulate pages of posts and peoples responses in order to prove a point (the fact they dont realise it isnt my problem), as long as the point is proved because to me its the facts thatcount, not the bullshiit your imagination just conceptualised<br>
<br>
I am extremely loyal to my friends and if they ask me to back off, i generally do so however I prefer to repeatedly hammer the point home.<br>
<br>
I hardly ever start threads on the flame boards and 99.99% of the time I will never flame anyone, that isnt flaming me.  The fact that i merely respond to other peoples flames is worth noting because the half dozen people on here who flame me religously (and they have their share of 'fans' too) know this as well.  They know that if they dont take a dig at me in some unrelated thread then I wont get invovled but they do it anyway because they WANT me to respond, such threads are their form of entertainment.<br>
<br>
Basically I may be a bitch, but I'm an honest straightforward bitch who detests the hypocrites in life (a few of which infest this board).<br>
<br>
Bit part players..<br>
<br>
<br>
Raedwulf aka the gimp<br>
<br>
An outward appearance of intelligence is used by raed along with his supposed 'legal expertise' in attempts to support whatever crusade he is currently on.  All he actually does (although he words it well) is subtly twist the structure of anothers post so as to (to him) support his opinions.  He has openly admitted that even though I may be correct on a certain point he would support the other person (knowing that persons point to be incorrect) and when called on it for being a hypocrite claimed he didnt care.<br>
<br>
<br>
Kerryn aka Mr IF (Imaginary Friend)<br>
<br>
Kerryn is a recent addition to the Em flame forum, his attitude towards me is easily explained.<br>
<br>
A while ago in another thread he made some very clear statements and when called on them he refused to back them up saying ''his friend would be upset if he divulged who had said what'', of course this made him a laughing stock and he appeared extremely foolish.  This has stung him and although he is clearly out of his league on here he struggles determinedly to attack me at any oppurtunity in order to get some 'payback'.  He sticks close to Dwarkarn and rubber stamps anything he says in his bid for acceptance.<br>
<br>
He's little league and knows it.<br>
<br>
-------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
<br>
So there you go, some background upon which to better understand the dynamics of the flames section.<br>
<br>
I have no doubt the people I profiled will have their responses (which I'll leave them too) as they have a biological and mental inability to let anyone else have the last say in the misbegotten belief that who speaks last wins, something the smarter people on here (Ven educated me on this /poke Ven) realise does not matter a damn.<br>
<br>
<br>
Over to you trolls (dont forget the qiotes and colored text)<br>

That about sums it up. Mitch will maniuplate pages of posts and peoples responses. Her own admission. Here in the real world we call that lying and cheating. Who the fu.ck are you kidding Mitch? We realised you were manipulating the truth and we called you a liar. You buried your head in the sand pretending you had not done so.<br>

Up until a few months ago my guild was the prime target for his psychotic ramblings and ravings. With the help of therapy and many, many drugs, he was able to slowly break the habit of mentioning Tzzird, Teuvas or Da`Kor at least twice a week… though, there’s still the occasional relapse I'm sure.<br>
<br>
I used to get involved anytime I saw him post. I treated him like a Whack-a-Mole. Anytime he opened his mouth and it related to my friends or me in any way, shape or form… he’d get smacked. But, alas, it eventually wore on me. I threw all my best material at him, sometimes posting things that would have sent any sane person into the Himalayas to live out the rest of their days as a hermit, never to be heard from again(see: Interactive Flame), but he just never seemed to grasp the fact that he was beaten. He’s a real trooper, in some sick way.<br>
<br>
I guess you could say I’ve passed the torch, so to speak, to these guys who continue the fight in my absence(I’ve recently acquired a new whipping boy on the DaoC Mordred board). Now I just kick back with a Sprite and a confused look on my face as he pushes on with his quest for truth, justice and a prescription renewal for Ritalin.<br>
<br>
Chiteng is the Energizer Bunny of the Emarr board… God, I hate that <i>f</i>ucking rabbit. <p><b>Vendrix</b><br>

<br>
He used to slap both Mitch and Chiteng silly on regular occasions. It seems only fitting that someone should take up the mantle where he left off.<br>
<br>
Oh and if you're wondering why we took up that mantle once Vendrix had stopped and not before it's because without the moles getting whacked every so often they were overunning our garden.<br>

Players (using the term loosely)<br>
<br>
Kerryn - Have you ever walked thru a public park and some kid on the swing set spits on you? That is what Kerryn is like. He isnt involved in anything, but he wants to be. Assuming that he wants to follow in the footsteps of Vendrix<br>
is a sad statement in itself.<br>
<br>
Raedwulf - No idea why he even plays the game. If he is who he says he is he doesnt have the time. He doesnt know or want to know the reality of any issue.<br>
If you dont accept what he says as gospel, he lables you as delusional. He likes<br>
to intersperse his comments with psychobabble and is a perfect example of why that word was created. I cant imagine grouping with him because he is totally<br>
unable to subordinate. He jumped on the bandwagon 9 months ago for no better<br>
reason than my apparent attitude annoyed him. It still does. Get a hanky Raed.<br>
<br>
Vendrix/Varixx - Varixx and I have a history. He portrays it in one way and I have<br>
remained silent. My biggest beef with Vendrix is his continual pandering to his masters(whoever they happen to be at the time) He has a modest inventivness<br>
and is able to actually evaluate a MMORG. This is something that most players<br>
dont do. He has many opinions of what he wants to believe has occured on the board, and I dont even care enough any longer to bother riposting.<br>
<br>
Mitch - Mitch is far from what she seems. The biggest beef I have observed from<br>
what people says is that Mitch plays the game, like a male. For some bizzare <br>
reason that pisses MANY players off. I cant imagine why. If they get scammed<br>
by a female player. pretendng to be male, they remain silent. It makes no sence to me at all. Mitch is a goal oriented player and a very good raid leader. She does<br>
make mistakes at times but anyone who makes a habit of pulling makes the same <br>
mistakes. The thing I like about Mitch is that she thinks for herself, and is not swayed by politics. She can at times be impatient and that is where things go wrong. She knows this and tries to keep her kool. But sometimes she cant.<br>
She reasearchs the in game goals well ahead of time and can rattle off critical<br>
information in mid-pull. She doesnt bail on her group just because events are hard<br>
I have seen her fall asleep at the terminal twice in mid-raid. That is dedication.<br>
She doesnt bother to explain herself or her reasoning very often and that is why<br>
she gets in fights. She assumes that everyone else is just as goal oriented as she is and the logic of her decisions therefore is self-evident. Impeccable reasoning<br>
except it ignores lazy/greedy players who are only along for the loot.<br>
She is apparently a VERY good barginer and is able to amass quite a collection<br>
of items thru simple trading. I am overwhelmed by this facet of Mitch.<br>
She is an determined opponent and relentless. She never gives up. I cant help<br>
but admire that.<br>
I will accept a good leader who doesnt bail, and I will follow them into hell if I must.<br>
<br>
Nuldar - Nuldar is the reason I backed off DaKor. Nuldar is not un-consciousnable<br>
and quite intelligent. He can get pissed off but it doesnt seem to cloud his judgement(an enviable ability)<br>
<br>
Dwarkarn - Dwarkarn is self-defining. He is a controlled scizophrenic and is habitually in his evil-clown role. However in un-guarded moments he will say<br>
something that shows that he isnt quite that shallow. However that never<br>
stands in the way of the evil-clown. It is his repulsive attacks on Mitch that<br>
prompted my conflict(s) with him.<br>
<br>
Chukazombi - High-profile Shaman. I have spoken directly to him twice in my memory. He seems to be quite careless in reading the board and gets many facts<br>
mixxed up. I cant say what he is like in the game. He told me he could not make gate-potions. I assumed that meant he could not make gate-potions.<br>
He seems to love glamour for its own sake. He seems fixxated on Mitch's gender.<br>
That always raises a red-flag in my mind. I cant help but think that alot of<br>
his attacks on Mitch are the result of some repressed sexual syndrone. However<br>
I am just guessing. It could be that he just doesnt like being contradicted.<br>
<br>
It might be amusing to start a new thread and call it 'Biographies' <p>“It is clear that the individual who persecutes a man, his brother, because he is not of the same opinion, is a monster.”

Although being unable to devote 30+ hours a week (usually between 8 and 12 hours a week) kept me from epic encounters and long camps (I did my Testament of Venear in about a dozen camps of an hour or two, and the same with my Paw of Oppola), I still enjoyed the game.  I have had 6 toons in their 20's, plus Raed at 52.  (2 20+ on Tallon Zek and one on Sullon Zek, all 3 of which have been deleted.)  Hanging with friends, chatting in EC or Misty or FV, etc. were all entertaining pasttimes.  It took me lots more time to get any of those levels, because I did lots and lots of stuff that didn't earn exp.  Raed's got 6 trade skills over 100, and three over 150 (not counting Alcohol Tolerance that is maxed).  Although I'm not a trade hound, I spent significant time selling off my tailored wares.  Last I checked (about three months ago and I've barely played 5 hours since) Raed had about 52 days played.  The rest of my toons might have 30 or so all together.  All since October 1, 1999 (although I have taken about 6 months worth of breaks to play other games).<br>
<br>
As for the rest of your silliness, you are the only person I've labeled as delusional.  I've disagreed with Dwarkarn (quite vocally on numerous occasions), Mitch (ditto), Chuk (ditto), Laoke and a bunch of others, and never labeled them as delusional.  You see, in the real world, you can disagree with someone without becoming mortal enemies, and agree with someone without becoming a mere follower.  I've indicated that other folks were deluded on certain issues, but that's different from your blanket statement.<br>
<br>
I'm unable to subordinate?  That's a new one.  It is also absolutely unsubstantiated by anything that has been said on this board.  Actually, I follow orders quite well in a group, especially since the folks leading the group generally have tons more experience than I.  I usually bow to the better judgement and experience of others.  That situation has simply never arisen on this cesspool board.  Again, you are talking out of your ass.<br>
<br>
I jumped on the bandwagon 9 months ago, huh?  Glad you are so obsessed with me that you've got that written down.  When's our anniversary?  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   [For the slow, that was sarcasm.]  And I didn't jump on any bandwagon.  After reading innumerable threads started by or derailed by you, I attempted to reason with you.  For the first month or so of our dialogue, I was completely reasonable and never attacked your position, even when disagreeing.  And it wasn't your &quot;attitude&quot; that annoyed me, but your constant idiocy, drivel, and intellectual dishonesty.  Now you are just a whipping boy.  As so many before me, I've given up on reasoning with you, and just enjoy making fun of you.  I try to be a better person, but it's still too much fun.  My therapist is working with me on this.  [Again, sarcasm.]<br>
<br>
Oh, and if you honestly think that the biggest beef anyone has with Mitch is that they think she's masquerading as a woman, then you really are deluded.  Folks don't like Mitch because she lies, is hypocritical, venomous and just plain rude.  She fits your usual paradigm of WOMAN, so I can see why you fawn over her so much.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
And again, with only a few exceptions regarding trade scams and her admitted destruction of the property of another, her in-game play style isn't an issue.  As I've never seen her in game to my knowledge, it has nothing to do with the distaste I have for her.  It's because she's a twit.  Period.  No jealousy, misplaced misogynistic rage, or anything else.<br>
<br>
<br>
P.S.  I can't wait to read someone else's dissertation and reworking of your biographies.  It'll be really funny if done by a pro.  I'd just muck it up, I'm sure. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=96910">My Crappy Stuff</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uxiqzshokskul.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Xiqz Shokskul</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 84<br> <font color=#E9D756>(5/29/02 5:54:20 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3363.topic&index=28>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> /die trolls</span><hr size=1> thats it. <br>

everyone with one thousand or more posts will now be permanently chained to this thread.<br>

you will be caged here. with no sunlight and no running water.<br>

you will be fed a handful of crackers each day, and a glass of rancid milk.<br>
<br>
you will piss in that filthy corner over there.<br>
<br>
do what you like with/to your clothing. it is the last clothing you will ever have.<br>
<br>
here in the dark and damp you will keep eachother company through the bars by conversing on any myriad of subjects you like.<br>
<br>
maybe talk about how dark it is, or the existential paradox of giving you rancid milk to drink.<br>
 <br>
whatever.<br>
<br>
those of you with three thousand or more posts..um... you will be left alone as you are obviously already being punished by a power greater than all of us. what variety of universe-spanning kharmic mishap you must have performed to get yourself into ..yourself.. well it would probably destroy our fragile brains just to hear it so, we dont want to know.<br>

<br>
To sort of shed some light on the situation....I compare Mitch, Chiteng, and the &quot;Others&quot; (the &quot;Others&quot; being the core of the group that is anti-Mitch/Chiteng), to the famous 3 legged stool.  (No, not tool, we could compare them to tools, but that has been done over and over again).<br>
<br>
Mitch is one leg, Chiteng is the second, and the &quot;Others&quot; are the third.  The stool represents status....power....fame (infamy?)....whatever title they are fighting for.  <br>
<br>
Well.....If you take one leg away...the stool itself will collapse.  If one leg wants to break, the other two will try and make sure that doesn't happen, because they don't want their stool to collapse.  <br>
<br>
The &quot;Others&quot;, so to say, wanted to back down out of this.  Relentlessly Mitch and Chiteng have found their way back in here, and are trying to keep the &quot;Others&quot; from breaking, by bringing up the same tireless garbage over and over again.  See, if one of them ultimately does &quot;win&quot;, they will have immediate satisfaction (aka, relief from holding up a stool), however they will fade out as they have no way to grab for attention, fame, or power anymore.<br>
<br>
It is truly quite amazing that all these people are wasting their intelligence on flaming each other. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uceldor.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Celdor</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 1930<br> <font color=#E9D756>(5/30/02 11:33:26 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3363.topic&index=31>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: /die trolls</span><hr size=1> I still think my link sums it up pretty well. <p><br><br><center><br><a href=http://www.stomptokyo.com/movies/wicker-man.html><small><b>I am looking for Rowan Morrison.</b></small></a></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/umitchtheblonde.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mitch The Blonde</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://megablonde.freewebspace.com/rbt-hex.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 3156<br> <font color=#E9D756>(6/2/02 6:00:01 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3363.topic&index=32>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: /die trolls</span><hr size=1> Ok Celdor I give in.<br>

LOL you have got to be joking, Ven managed to be both witty and cutting at the same time whilst (usually) using facts to make his points...you?  ...you're not even a pale imitation.<br>
<br>
<br>
''He used to slap both Mitch and Chiteng silly on regular occasions. It seems only fitting that someone should take up the mantle where he left off.''<br>
<br>
I assume you were reading a different board.  What went on with him and Chit is their business but me and Ven only ever tangled on a few select issues and there were no winners, only people who decided that the unmovable object and the irresistable force were a waste of time persuing.<br>
<br>
We called it quits and moved on, but then again, we were not obsessed.<br>
<br>
<br>
''Oh and if you're wondering why we took up that mantle once Vendrix had stopped and not before it's because without the moles getting whacked every so often they were overunning our garden.''<br>
<br>
<br>
Please stop fvckign deluding yourself that you've taken up some 'notional' mantle (sic).  The diff between you and Ven is that he was a wisecracking @#%$ who was funny and you're just a gimp, capiche?<br>
