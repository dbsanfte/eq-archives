He didn't turn on his signal when going left ... now he's dead. For all you know he may have had a bench warrant for a speeding ticket and was scared... so lets shoot him ! The story says he was trying to run the officer over. With being boxed in I find that a little exaggerated and once again, he was probably scared shitless and was afraid of that exact thing happening. "No one will listen so I might as well go for it.. they are going to shoot me anyway" was probably his last thoughts. There was NO gun found, NO drugs and only the word of the officers on scene (they of course aren't know to ever protect each other /sarcasm off).<br>
There are so many incidents out there that turn tragic over a traffic stop. Why is it such a difficult concept to write down his license number and go get him when everything cools down ? Not all people that run from police like that are felons ya know.<br>
I feel really bad for his family now, having to bury their son over a traffic violation. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ulithahntalon.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lith Ahntalon</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/image/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 318<br> <font color=#E9D756>(6/18/02 1:21:37 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3405.topic&index=44>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Wow, Crime, that's tough.</span><hr size=1> No disrespect Pidany but, he isn't dead because of a traffic stop, he is dead because he made some really bad choices.

I've never been an officer, so I couldn't say for sure, but I like to give people the benefit of the doubt.  I'm also sorry that you seem to have no respect for the people that put themselves on the line day after day for YOU.  Law enforcement agencies provide order, or as much order as they can.  Without order, there is only chaos.<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Not all people that run from police like that are felons ya know.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Then why are they running?  As you stated from the report there were no weapons or drugs found in the car, but how exactly were the officers supposed to know that at the time?  ESP?  Like I said in my previous post, you have to assume the worst in those types of situations.  I know if someone were trying to run me over, the first thought that entered into my head wouldn't be &quot;well, maybe he's just misunderstood.&quot;  One of these days people are going to learn to take responsibility for their actions.  You can either suck it up and own up to what you've done, or you can run from it.  As Lith said, he had many chances to just pull over and end it, but he had to have it ended for him. <p>Carathos Ollathir<br>

As I said above, I recently got pulled over, and I didn't run for it.  No, I just pulled over, annoyed and sat there til he was done, thanked him and moved on, even tho I wasn't even remotely pleased by the delay.  Oh, I suppose I coulda floored it and tried to drive from Denton to Dallas, but geez, why.<br>

Your right no gun or drugs were found in the car so why did the person run? Your guess is as good as mine but that doesnt mean he didnt commit any serious crimes. <br>
<br>
Evading the Police is a Felony. To endanger the lives of countless people because you dont want a traffic a ticket is very serious. He had many miles of road to simply stop but he made the DECISION to continue the pursuit. <br>
<br>
Now we go back to your thoery of just getting his plate number and getting him later. Ok ill bite on this. I am on patrol and see a traffic violation, I attempt to make a stop and the vehicle runs. I get the plate and simply discontinue the pursuit. Now there are many things that can happen, the suspect may not notice I stopped and keep driving at excessive speeds until he crashes into a kills an innocent person or the mother of all. You notify the Police Dept that your child was just kidnapped by a person driving the vehicle I could of just stopped and we find your child 2 months later in a shallow grave. Now should I have continued after this person now that it is hitting home?<br>
<br>
Police officers are not mind readers but when you run from the police it is a serious offense. Its very simple, dont run. To the worry about Police officers shooting first, You are right but I am the one risking my life on the street trying to keep it safe and dont have the luxury of sitting back and arm chair quaterbacking from my living room. It is a very simple thing to understand, If I ( that means me and only me) belive my life to be endanger, no matter what if a weapon is involved or not I have the right to protect myself. There is also law which states a Police officer need not decease or retreat in making an arrest.<br>

While you say you aren't suggesting that cops disarm themselves, you say that it is unhealthy for them to match force with the seedier side.

Throughout my posts you appear to have missed the fact that i state that in the society in which you live OF COURSE officers have to be armed. The arguement is that perhaps this right to bear arms does have repercussions, specifically leading to higher lethality for police officers and/or more 'suicides by cop'. <br>
<br>
The rest of my posts are a 'countering opinion' not a 'preaching session'. Because my opinions appear to violently oppose your own however they somehow loose integrity?<br>
Those opinions are based on my insights into a society where guns are not so prevalent, perhaps you are the true 'preacher' here? You seem to prefer bombastic insult to reasoned arguement certainly.<br>

<br>
Carathos isn't bible thumping.  He disagrees with you, and as far as I have been able to determine, you are that antagonistic one here.  Because the majority of us feel that the officer most likely had valid reasons to believe his life was in danger, we are somehow lacking in understanding your &quot;rhetoric&quot;<br>
<br>
I'm sorry, I have the utmost respect for officers of law.  They put themselves into situations that endanger their lives on a daily basis.  <br>
<br>
Sure you hear about bad apples on occasion, but trust me, they are the minority, no matter what people believe.  <br>
<br>
You might live in a society where guns aren't nearly as prevalent, and while I personally support gun control, I'd rather see a felon...and he WAS a felon once he ran, shot down to save an officers life, then to lose an officer.  <br>
<br>
You fail to comprehend one point.  This man committed a felony, period, when he ran.  Everything else, EVERYTHING, the reason he ran, whether he had drugs/warrants/guns in the car become moot at that point.  He may not have had anything readily apparent in the car that could be considered &quot;just cause&quot; in his mind for him to run, but once he did.  CRIMINAL.  And guess, what, law abiding folks don't run from a routine traffic stop.  Annoyed as we might be, we pull over.<br>
<br>
Think about this.  Right where the chase ended there is a middle school.  Pick a few hours earlier or later, and he could have been in the middle of a couple hundred school children, including MINE, who attend that school.  I&quot;m glad they shot him down, the officer deserves a f'uckin medal.  Period. <p><IMG SRC="http://candysroom.net/caoilfhionn.jpg"><BR>

<br>
You have to understand that as far as policing goes we are two very very different societys more then on any other subject I would imagine.<br>
<br>
Let me tell you something, the argument about using the billy club ( Truncheon if you want to use it's proper name ) against a moving car is moot. The reason is this, drivers in England do not drive their cars at Police Officers. Raise your argument as much as you like but I'll tell you how this would have gone down in England.<br>
<br>
Suspect is pulled over on a routine inspection or due to just cause on behalf of the officers involved ( always 2 in an on duty police car ), and the guy makes a break for it. At this point the copper chopper is brought in equipped with infra-red and thermographic cameras. Cars controlled by a central office would move to intercept and they would wait by the side of a road they had forced the car to go down. When the suspect comes close they throw a stinger ( telescopic road obstacle with 8 inch spikes ) on the ground which punctures every tyre and deflates them instantly ( spikes are hollow ) and they retract it to allow the pursuing cars to follow. At this point the car becomes almost immovable and certainly uncontrollable. Cars surround the suspect and the officers get out and ask the person to get out of the car. They then arrest him. They don't lean in the window, the driver can not pull away, the driver does not pull a gun. He gets out calmly because he know's he's screwed.<br>
<br>
There are no cop killings here. People don't run officers over. We don't have drive by shootings, or gangland killings. Police officers don't chase suspects through residential areas or near schools. They let the chopper follow the car, and the cars follow at a reasonable distance. They then resume the chase at a later stage. If the dirver bolts out of the car, they can't hide due to thermographic cameras.<br>
<br>
We get to see Cops and Worlds Scariest Police Chaces and its a drama. Over here we have Police, Camera, Action and it's funny show with no violence.<br>
<br>
Lith, would you prefer your work went that way? What would be your answer if I told you I could take almost every single gun out of america and get rid of the criminal american way of thinking to shoot an officer or otherwise harming him/her. Now tell these people.<br>
<br>
So as much as people can talk about a way of doing things are you aware how it works in other countries?<br>
<br>
It's nearly too late for American society to go this way due to a perpetual circle. Because your criminals have guns your police officers must have them. Because everyone has guns there is a higher chance that someone, right or wrong will use one.<br>
<br>
Violent crime happens more often per human being over there then it does here so defend your past generations choice as you will but you'll never get other societys agreeing with you.<br>
<br>
Somewhere along the line American Society made a choice before any of us were born. They chose a way to defend their country and guns have always been a part of that system. Somewhere along the line the British made a better job or scaring people into thinking that once you get caught you go quietly and I don't know what that was. <br>
<br>
What you are left with now is a bunch of officers who I have a great respect for because it is a war they fight. They do the best they can and like all of us they occasionally screw up but generally they do a good job. As much as I respect them for that and would defend THEM in any argument it's easy to see that whoever made the decisions in the past forced them into a way of life they should not have to live. And you cannot defend that. <p><CENTER><A HREF="http://ak.lonelygamer.com">

<br>
I personally agree with most of your argument that guns getting involved in the American populace has caused a great deal of crime un-neccesary; however, I wouldn't go so far as to say all of your policeman are safe from peril.<br>

<br>
I know thats out of context but thats one of the funniest things I have ever read.  You do realize the US is not a little island where everyone is prety much the same.  We have people here where owning a gun is a way of life.  Not everyone can hop in their Jetta, run to the market real quick and pick up some food. This is a big country with lots of different types of people.   <br>
<br>
Hell, there are militias in the mountains who would <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> never</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> give up their right to bear arms without a fight.  I suppose if you killed everyone one of them and pried their firearms from their hands the US could be gun free, but I don't see that happening anytime soon (btw, I'm curious about how England came about to destroying all the guns in the country, I wonder if it would work here).<br>
<br>
I've known people who live in cities, not in any kind of militia (one was a preacher actually) that have used the quote &quot;You can take my gun by prying it from my cold dead hands&quot;  and honestly, I believed them.<br>
<br>
As with anything its easy to play armchair quarterback and say how something should be done, but if you don't live here, you don't know what it would take.  It's easy to say &quot;if America was gun free&quot; but can it really be done?  Hell, most drugs are highly illegal, but I still see/hear about dealers getting busted all the time, and I'm sure as soon as one is another one pops up.  Why would guns be any different?  There certainly would be a big demand for them.  <br>
<br>
Yes, I will agree that if there were no guns here, violent crimes would probably go down.  I will dissagree, however, that it would be nearly impossible to do so.<br>

I stated in the thread earlier exactly how much respect I have for any police officer. Perhaps the fault is mine since you have also apparently misunderstood my stance Cao.  <br>
<br>
ALL I've been saying is that since human beings are involved  situations will not be clearly defined, mistakes &amp; tragedys happen etc. (and please, please don't take that to mean that this particualar incident was a mistake by the cop, I'm speaking generally - as I have in all my later posts!). When guns HAVE to be part of the situation (and I'm not argueing that guns aren't neccessary over there, for whatever reason that may be) the consequences are that much more final.  <br>
<br>
Carathos' first post to this thread took quotes from one of my own and argued totally off the point i was making.  The pepper spray quote for example supposes that (assuming gun control exists and therefore the suspects WILL NOT LIKELY BE SO ARMED and that again because of that assumption the officer doesn't need to be so equipped himself) the officers' non-lethal training will be enough to control the situation, and that it is the fact that he is armed that makes the situation more explosive (as it clearly did). The only reason the pepper spray etc was mentioned is that i wanted to make it clear that I had taken in what Lith had said earlier and was confident that an american police officer has the training to  control a situation without recourse to his gun, it was basically a compliment!  <br>
<br>
It seems I didn't explain my view as well as i thought, hopefully I'm making myself and my opinion clearer now?<br>
<br>
Right at the beginning of this thread I mentioned that I expected to get flamed, given that my view would probably be considered contentious. I was happily surprised to have a reasonable discussion (into which a number of actual US police officers had their say without any flame fest!) until dear Carathos came late to the game.<br>
<br>
 I read Carathos post and - since to me it seemed he had totally ignored much of what I had previously said and seemed intent on slagging my view with no real understanding of what I actually meant - I did indeed get a little annoyed :/. <br>
I felt and still feel that throughout the course of this and in fact any discussion I enter, I take pains to avoid being too judgemental or unfair and to have that 'thrown in my face' was galling.<br>
<br>
If anyone besides Carathos feels I have been condescending towards them throughout the course of this thread then I apologise since that was assuredly not my intent. Unfortunately, I can't in all honesty say that an apology to Cara will be heartfelt, heh.<br>
<br>
Peace? <br>

<br>
Gahulo, you couldn't immediately turn it around of that I'm sure. I think the reason guns are not so prevalent over here in Britain has less to do with their availability and more to do with how they are percieved in our culture. <br>
<br>
Gun's have been heavily restricted from long before i was born, as we grow up here they are classified by society as 'bad'. A dangerous item to be used only for specific tasks etc. As such since very few criminals are totally immoral psychopaths, the use of a firearm is still percieved as 'a bit over the top'. Given that you guys have been brought up with them in general circulation and are thus more 'comfortable' with them, the taboo against their useage is that much weaker - it's more 'normal' to have one, thus more criminals are comfortable with their useage.<br>
<br>
Should America choose to practise gun control any changes in that code of behaviour would not be overnight, it would take probably 10 - 20 years at least for opinions to be modified by custom I think. &lt;Safety clause&gt; Since i don't live in America of course all this is purely conjecture on my part <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/udwelfnvhal.showPublicProfile?language=EN>DwelfnVhal</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 253<br> <font color=#E9D756>(6/20/02 10:51:29 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3405.topic&index=60>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Wow, Crime, that's tough.</span><hr size=1> Argh, the safety clause sounds arrogant and it wasn't meant too <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Ignore it please.<br>

Just as an aside, do your military &quot;peace keeping officers&quot; in Northern Ireland carry firearms? Of course, armored personnel carriers and rubber bullets can't be deemed firearms...I guess.<br>

<br>
     You are correct about the presence of a firearm even if it is an officer's. If memory serves me correctly statistically speaking more US police officers are killed with thier own firearm than with another firearm actually carried by a suspect. When I first got onto my dept our armorer who also happens to be our firearms instructor made it very clear during our initial training that ALL confrontations are armed conforntations because you (the police officer) bring the firearm to the conforntation. I would agree with you on this point. Officers have come up with ways to counter this by doing things like carrying back-up weapons (on various parts  our body depending on personal prefernce), learning how to disable our own firearm, wearing body armor that is classified to stop the caliber of weapon we carry, etc. Companies that contract with law enforcement have also been of great help with the above stated body armor production, saftey holsters (of many varieties) which hinder us little in drawing but one must know HOW to draw the firearm thus greatly hindering a suspect from drawing it from our hip, etc. I would bet pounds to pents <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  it is daily getting harder and harder for a police officer to be disarmed or injured with his own firearm through training and technology. All that being said, I still agree with you we (the police officers) bring the gun. I wil say thought that on a dailky basis I am more worried about getting run over by some inattentive driver than I am about getting shot.<br>
<br>
Kerryn,<br>
     The scenario you presented is a textbook take down of a fleeing driver. Things are rarley if ever textbook for a variety of reasons. First you have to have the budget to actually afford a helicopter (most Jurisdictions don't), second you have to have terrain that a helicopter would actually be usefull. In my city, a midsize, historic, southern city with a LOT of trees a helicopter is not fesible for either bugetary or terrain reasons. I do wish it was that easy though but, it isn't. Ask you own Bobbies and they will tell you. <br>
<br>
     To answer your question I will be painfully honest. No, I stand by my conviction of the right to bear arms. If there were no firearms people would still find a way to kill each other. <br>
<br>
     As far as getting rid of firearms in the US, won't happen, not in my lifetime at least and probalby not in my grandchildrens (should I have any <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ) lifetime either.I will probably catch hell for this but, here it goes, we Americans for the most part really are the &quot;cowboys&quot; the rest of the world seems to think we are. Many of us, about 80 million or more legally registered firearm owners, view firearms as just not a tool or a  piece of sporting equipment but, as a birthright. Something we are garunteed to have at our disposal. This feeling is still deeply rooted in our culture and probably dates back to our &quot;conquest&quot; of the west and even the role the common man with a rifle played in the founding of our country during the Revolutionary War. This attitude and the fact that the number of leagally owned firearms is probably five to ten times the number of legal owners of these firearmes is the reason gun control and gun removal has and probably won't happen in the US. It is also most likely the reason the US will not enter into many treaties with the UN which contain some sort of firearm control in them. A little know fact is that treaties entered with other countries supercede rights garunteed by our Constitution. <br>
<br>
     All in all though, as I said before, apples and oranges. England does it thier way, we do it ours and we are all happy with the outcome. <br>
