class=m><span class=title> Jesy</span><hr size=1> Wanted to let people know about this guy..it is comon for people to swith items that are lore to another character or pat someone to carry a lore iem for you to someone..that is this case..I had pulled,kited and killed a named mob on christams night..Item dropped was a 5k item..At the time Jesy had tracked the mob to me as I was fighting it..since it was lore my first question to him was did he want to buy the item he had said no..since i had a few friends in zone i was gonna get one of them to come get the item for me and then I was gonna in turn give that item to a friend as a christamas gift..Anyways this fellow agreed to courier the item for me for payment which was convienant since he was already there at the death sight of the mob..I would not have to call a friend to get it and<br>worry about corpse decay..I allowed this guy to loot item..I then went linkdead but not before letting him know a little basic info about the item inluding the value..When i got back from link he was still waiting there for me but was acting strangly ..Not responding to my tells and says and such,he finally grouped with me and we headed to where my friend was.After getting there i gave my gauntlets to my friend and when I asked for the looted pair from Jesy he refused to give them to me.He stated that he is gonna keep them and was still hesitant..After speking with a gm I come to find out he petitioned a gm and they told him he could keep them and there was nothing they could do because I had allowed him to loot them after the 3 minute timer..I then proceeded to talk to his guild leaders about his actions as per gm suggestion..They in turn reviewed all information and also in turn said they would do nothing..Reason being was they figure if gm said he could keep it was ok with them and also they would not want to lose a bard from there guild that would have a following of individuals that would prolly follow him from the guild..The guild leader also said that if i posted him has a thief on this board they would retaliate in kind by posting one on me and claim me to be a farmer,so watch for upcoming retaliation..I myself have 3 well known and liked witnesses of this event which are well respected by many, Biwin,Wyhspier,and Aladon...according to thier leaders they do not know or trust these people which i find funny because they are friends with 90% of the server and are well known and loved by us all..Basically it boils down to this..He agreed to be paid to transport item across the same zone,when he found out items value decided to keep fo himself,and also caused alot of grief and lost time for many people and gm's due to his greed and dishonesty..Be warned of this guy do not trust him with anything you may find valuable to you or others and beware his guild will back him due to his popularity in the guild<br><br>Edited by Leolan: removed guild info from title <p></p><i>Edited by: <A

I also hold my members to be honorable in there dealings with others and treat other people with respect. i also expect my members to suport each other in the good times and the bad times. <br><br>Ok to the prob at hand this is what i know of it i was not there nor anyone i know. <br><br>I log in and get tells from Kitkoran about the prob we had a 3 hour long talk in which she started with one story. i listened and when she was thru i started to ask questions and she ansered but with each  question  her story would start to  change first there was nobody who she wanted to give the gloves to she wanted to sell them to jesy. then as i  asked questions there was one person she wanted to then there were two people she wanted to loot the gloves. by this time i am realy confused at what happened so we talk more and she starts telling me how much money she has and how much the gloves are worth. and how the gms are on her  side and we were all wrong and liars and dishonest i have no clue as to how the gms are involved so i contact the gm and get two gms contact me over the matter. <br><br>the gms side of the story did't match up with hers either and her claim that the gms were on her side and intended to back her in blacklisting my guild were false. <br><br>after talking with the gms i begin talking with jesy he claims she is lieing that he never agreeded to hold them for her he claims that she only wanted to sell them. and her unable to loot them he did &lt;on a side note should he have looted them no it was't his kill but he did&gt; <br><br>Now begins my prob i beleave in standing with my guild mates nomatter what until proved they are dishonest. <br><br>I am faceed with one of the hardest prob a guild leader can face. do i beleave my guild mate or do i beleave somebody i don't know. In my eyes its his word against hers i ask him if he knows anyone who was there he said no he did't so i  talk to the people she knew well i talked to one and my real  life wife &lt; known in game as Mistymoon&gt; talked to another now i compare these accounts of the story and there were parts in them that were diffrent from each other and diffrent from kitkorans. <br><br>Now this is what i am thinking at this point in time one i have a bard that altho i don't know well but my wife does and he has always treated members with respect and kindness and has gone out of his way to help others telling me that kitkoran is lieing and i have kit tellign me she is the most honest person on the server and there isn't a person who should't beleave her &lt;maybe its true maybe its not i don't know her&gt; what i do know for a fact this is a prob that is between her and jesy and ther is no proof either way cause everyone has friends and what friend won't go to bat for one another so how can i prove what they say is true when there are discrepencys in there storys and what the gm told me of it<br><br>so based on lack of evidence i decided to tell jesy to keep the gloves because by this time kit had begun makeing threats on my guild and blacklisting us and guild war &lt;i for which don't like guild war but if this will solve it my guild will defend our name anytime any place&gt; i told her  that the gms had contacted me and that they told him he could keep the gloves that he looted them fair and square she then became angry and started shouting and /ooc abusives remarks directed toward my guild and jesy himself. <br><br>i just want to finish up with saying one this is a no win sitituation and wrong doings were done on both sides but in my case and the guilds case we have to stand by our members or the guilds not worth joining and this is all i did i tryed to apoligize to her for it but also told her i did't know of any thing i could do that i would not harm my guild or its well being over a loot disagrement that is her word agianst his in my eyes and i dont' think any other guild leader would have done diffrent.<br><br><br>Namin Soulburner<br>Leader<br>United powers Norrath<br><br>P.S if anyone questions the honesty of my guild they are welcome to visit our web page and see the post from other guilds who have worked with us in the past and will in the furture. www.angelfire.com/rpg/upn feel free to post on our boards if you need our help<br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/beqasylum.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=redqueen>Red Queen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>n00b!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(12/26/00 6:51:21 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=343.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Jesy, bard and dishonest thief of guild U.P.O.N</span><hr size=1> ok just wanted to throw my 2 cents worth in..to start i do not know this kitkoran or this jesy person so i will not judge them..this is what i do know though...i was at orc fort that night with my group..we had just got wiped out bad by a bad pull and killed nearly all of us...kitkoran happened to poop in from who knows where and pull the named mob...at this time i told her we were camping this creature and she apologized  because when she got on she didnt see anyone..this is understandable since most of us were just bodies lying in the snow..i also asked her if she needed the gloves if not we could use them..she informed me that she had someone in mind that could use them but if not she would let me know..later she informed me they were gonna be a gift for a friend and has someon taking them to him at that time..i had watched her from ther hiltop kite this orc and kill it..she was approached by someone and they stood as if talking for a while then they left..after that i do not know what happened to them till later that night i saw an ooc go out about this jesy guy being put on blacklist for thievery and dishonesty...also from what i saw there was nothing rude or distastefull about the ooc...in my opinion it was more of a warning because she did not name call or cuss or anything...well like i said just my 2 cents worth <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/umasterxeng.showPublicProfile?language=EN>MasterXeng</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>w4nn4b3!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(12/26/00 7:25:23 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=343.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Jesy, bard and dishonest thief of guild U.P.O.N</span><hr size=1> Speaking from personal exp . . .

Sure all people playing this game has KS at least once, be it your fault or not. All ppl has looted something and was called all kinds of names because someone else didnt thought you had a right for it.<br><br>I dont know Jesy personally, i havent grouped with him, i woudnt say he is my friend. But this i know; i was informed about this incident by another Guild officer who kept his EQLOG while he was chating with Kitkoran. Throught all the discussion several discrepancies appeared in Kitkorans tells. I dont know what really happened, but from what i read and from what i talked to Jesy i would say theres not much that can prove that Jesy did something to be put in a blackbook or something.<br><br>Now i dont know Kitkoran either, but with all the talking about this issue, with GM saying that Jesy could keep the item, well then it makes me think why Kitkoran is so busy with the blames on Jesy?<br>GM that are the EQ gods says his not to blame and they close the issue. Why get into a public board and say &quot;this guy was mean to me, so everybody punish him&quot;. True this whole thing could have been handled different by Jesy, as well as by Kitkoran, but GM were called and they setled the issue.<br>(This reminds me the gazillion times the AC was KS from me, i didnt went to the boards to post my complains about it).<br>Why make the accusations? i was told that after a while Jesy offered to just give the item back to cool things off, but that Kitkoran refused (true at this point the discussion was pretty heated).<br>I find all this blaming on public sites childish, its not the way things should be handled.<br>You make accusations on a guildmember of UPON, and accusations arise about the honesty of the guildleaders.<br>You said that our guild was not to blame that you had friends in it, why at the moment of writing down your post you didnt think about the implications of your acts?<br>Why after stating your honorabilility and your friends saying your acts are without taint, the reputation of Jesy is to be made garbage? your so without blame that others must be steped into because you said so?<br>What would make you happy? That Jesy is banned from EQ?<br><br><br>Now we all make mistakes this whole thing should have been handled differently by Jesy as i said before. When i make mistakes i apologize as we all do. Jesy did act wrong on this issue. Namin the leader of our guild did what he should have, since theres not much evidence to blame Jesy, UPON will not act on this issue.

He has always treated me with the upmost respect and had never been worried about looting while he has been with me.  He is always trying to give away gifts to others, this is the Jesy I know.  <br><br>My second point, I was with Jesy last night while the last part was going on.  He told me personally that he would just give her the gloves back if that would help just solve the dispute.  I am pretty well known and all who know me know that I would not lie about something like that - Jesy did say he would give them back.<br><br>Third as far as our guild reputation I would like to say that our members go out of there way to help others if they are asked to and we have a strong guild which trys to do their best and treat all equally no matter what.  I will not mention names but I have several dear friends who are from various other guilds which are respected and well known as well who have come with us on raids, etc, all of which have been pleasant.<br><br>Last I would like to add that you can't make everyone happy although you may try.  What happened was misfortuante and I hope that everyone who reads this post will not judge Jesy nor any of our guildmates on what one person has said.<br><br>Mistymoon Light <br>44th Warrior<br>Proud Officer of United Powers of Norrath<br>     <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/utanilaelanys.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tanilae Lanys</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Tank Girl</span><br> <font color=#000033>(12/27/00 1:11:21 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=343.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://web.infoave.net/~tajulian/tanilaeintolans-face.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Jesy, bard and dishonest thief of guild U.P.O.N</span><hr size=1> I too remember this Jesy from my younger seasons in Crushbone, and the behavior was much the same as someone previously posted.
