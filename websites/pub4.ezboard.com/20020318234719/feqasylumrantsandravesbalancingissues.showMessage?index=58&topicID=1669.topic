Could have it so that when a character kills a PC viewed as abhorrant to his personal views or deity, he gets some sort of fame or karma point(s).<br>
<br>
Karma points (KP) could be used to unlock skills, quests, or other releveant content.<br>
<br>
One thing is for sure; if they make it so that players can kill each other, in limited zones, even on &quot;care bare&quot; servers, it will be more fun.  As challenging as a mob may be, nothing is more cunning, dangerous, or deadly than a well played human opponent.  I don't care how bad-ass a mob is.  A guild taking down Vulak'Aerr, once they figure the strategy, knows how to take down Vulak'Aerr.  The strategy is basically the same each and every time--though perhaps more refined.  A guild trying to take out another guild... strategies that work one battle may be completely invalidated the next.  Would add a whole new element of difficulty.<br>
<br>
If nothing else, it would drive the market back up on resist gear and some insta-cast items, like the pre-nerf CoS.<br>
<br>
Any ideas on this?  (Just trying to brainstorm here.  I plan to bounce my ideas off on Verant; whether or not they will take any to heart.... *shrug*) <p>Shallandra McKnight, Uba Monkey<br>

Assuming there is some reward in attacking/defending the planes, players will want it.  Afterall players want the best loot, and that's the only way to get it.  So, it forces pvp onto a non pvp game.  You have the choice of entering an arena and fighting someone for 0 reward.  When you need to pvp in a non-pvp game to experience the high level game, it's kind of silly.  It would be a dumb move for VI to tell the players: to experience the high end game during the next expansion, you will have to pvp a lot, sorry.  It's a great way to lose any customers who hate pvp, which is probably quite a bit.<br>

Being forced to do it would be us logging in one day and the entire game is PvP. Logging in and knowing &quot;Hey, if I go into this plane, I am entering a PvP arena against other players for some reward&quot; is someone making a *choice*<br>
<br>
This game has *never* handed everything it has to offer to just anyone who plugs in the CD. You have to want something, go after it, and make it yours. This doesn't change anything, nor force anyone into anything. <p><center>

<br>
problem is to many people in one place at one time. not enough mobs to kill. So only real solution is to add mobs that everyone would be willing to kill. Can do this buy changing un used zones to something that would be used. maybe by removing healers, removing sk, mobs makign it easier to get to. By looking at uber mobs that are never killed. Like inno no one kills him because time vs reward is worthless. risk vs reward is actually right on him. 60 shaman + 60 tank could kill him<br>
<br>
pvp zones not many would do they would end up like kerra islse, droga, nurga, permafrost, sol a, Sirens, WW. all underused zones with very few people in them. <p><img border="0" src="http://falcor81.future.easyspace.com/sig001.gif" ></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ucicelygoldenfair.showPublicProfile?language=EN>cicely goldenfair</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lanys Cheerleader</span><br> <font color=#000033>(2/9/02 9:00:20 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumrantsandravesbalancingissues.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1669.topic&index=66>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Level 70 Expansion?</span><hr size=1> the risk vs reward factor is still there.  not every nagafen slaying is going to produce the loot that you seek.  every time you kill nagafen, you are taking the chance of hoping for the desired loot you seek.<br>
<br>
tso killed talendor the other day.  it dropped three bracers.  of all the drops that talendor could have dropped (cloak of flames, torbin eyepatch, red scale for starters) it dropped three bracers.  obviously, this was not the desired loot that tso was expecting with the kill; however, it was the risk that we took to go after the rewards we were seeking.<br>
<br>
as far as your comment goes shallandra, i highly disagree.  you claim that there are only three guilds on this server that can kill dozekar.  i believe there are many more guilds that, if and when the guild gets all of their key players online at the same time, can take out dozekar.  however, because these guilds are not able to assemble and form at a whim, and because they are not a highly structured guild that has players that play every day from 5pm-12pm eastern time (as an example), they are not able to even have the OPPORTUNITY to go after dozekar.  you give a guild the OPPORTUNITY to assemble all of its players, and you give a guild the OPPORTUNITY to go after mob 'y'... then you may see success.  and if you don't have success that first time, then the guild learns and grows and develops strategies for the next time it can go after mob 'y'.<br>
<br>
to me, the problem with the high end game of everquest is the lack of opportunities for all guilds and all high end players to go after all mobs in the game.  this is the key thought process through all my posts.... high end players lacking OPPORTUNITIES.  as it stands now, the only high end players that are able to go after all that everquest has to offer is those players in the largest guilds on each server... the guilds that are able to assemble immediately after a patch and go after all the highly contested spawns on the server and succeed.  <br>
<br>
like someone mentioned earlier... if my proposal is reality, nagafen drops a cloak of flames once every 35 real life days hypothetically.  they mentioned... isn't that what happens in sleeper's tomb already?  yes, it does.  does that stop fallen legacy from entering into sleeper's tomb a few times a week and going after primal weapons for their members?  no, it does not.  guilds that want desired loot off of a specific mob will repeatedly kill that mob as many times as it takes until they receive said loot.<br>
<br>
it is disappointing when you finally get all of your friends/guildmembers together and form a complete and powerful raid and want to go after mob 'y'... only to see mob 'y' is not up.  and mob 'z', mob 'b', mob 'c', mob 'f', mob 'r', etc etc etc etc.  all my thoughts convey with random 8-24 hour spawns of all ubers, is that all players have access to all mobs for the majority of the time when they have assembled a raid force able to slay said uber mob.<br>
<br>
and again, as far as loot goes, every time you kill a certain mob it may/may not drop the desired loot that you are seeking.  there is always risk vs reward, and guilds that do seek a certain loot will take as much time as it wants to go after that loot... this is proven with sleeper's tomb.  if it was that boring and if it sucked that bad, guilds on all servers would no longer go into sleeper's tomb... <br>
<br>
there is more than enough high end content to satisfy all guilds on all servers at the end game.  it is availability and opportunities of said high end content that is the number one problem of this game, imho.<br>

Every time you fail, there's a rez/buff period, or an sc period, or whatever.  This takes up time.  The only consequence of failing is that it eats up time.  Thus, at best, risk vs reward is two things.  The numbers/levels/skills to kill a mob(in small parts), mixed with the time requirement to kill said mob, when compared with the loot said mob drops.  When you're spending multiple hours per day killing the same mobs for reduced drops, your risk/reward goes down.  You're killing a difficult mob, in an extended raid, yet you're forced to kill it everyday for a week for the loot you'd normally have in one kill.<br>
<br>
Take  ntov for example, the individual mobs are fairly balanced(for the most part), in terms of the loot they drop.  However because they're all packed together, the loot is a bit on the easy time to obtain simply because you only need to put in the time to raid the zone once, but you get a shot at 14 ubers.  <br>
<br>
Fallen legacy does st a few times a week not because we enjoy it, in fact we hate it.  We'll stop as soon as possible.  However we NEED primal, it's a huge boost for most of our melee.  Most uber mobs don't drop things we need, especially with primal weapons.  It's one thing to spent 4-5 hours a week total to kill the golems 9 times, it's another to spend 35 hours a week clearing ntov over and over again, just to get the same amount of loot one normally would.  It's bad enough we have to waste so much time in st, it would be worse if we had to waste that much time for EVERYTHING.  The argument: we have it bad, so everyone should have it bad, is not a perticularly good one.<br>

People at the top level of the game will always strive to kill the most powerful things in the game, to experience the endgame.  Eq has never been based around pvp, it wasn't designed that way.  After years, to turn around and expect people to pvp to experience the endgame is silly.  Pvp isn't balanced, at all.  There are a lot of assholes on red servers who like to do it(not saying all people on red servers are assholes), but that doesn't mean it's right for everyone.  Considering VI is all about balance, they would never force something so unbalanced on the high level community.<br>

<br>
I think Verant realizes that with each expansion they only delay the inevitable - that the high end players will max out the game.  First, raise the level cap from 50 - 60.  Then, create the faction work required to succeed in Velious and the Sleeper story.  Now, it is Alternate Advancement Points.<br>
<br>
But, what happens once people get their all of the titles available to them, and have a bunch of AA points?  They (VI) has once again only delayed the inevitable.<br>

At the same time, there is a *ton* of content currently in the game, enough to keep the average casual player satisfied for a very, very long time.<br>
<br>
So, why not create &quot;Expert Classes&quot; and zones specifically for them?  Say, for example, that you need to be level 60 and have the highest AA title.  Then you can become a 'new class' - it solves the &quot;no skills over 255&quot; problem because you start over at Level 1 with all of your skills at 1, but the skills are based off of new tables that start where the old ones leave off.<br>
<br>
And new zones.  Similar to how you have to be 45+ to hit the planes, you have to be a new class to hit these new zones.  &quot;Enhanced classes&quot; would only get XP or AA points in the new zones - everything in the existing zones becomes trivial.  <br>
<br>
As I said, the game currently has a ton of content.  Casual players could continue to play the current game - many many people would be perfectly happy exploring all of the current zones, and most will never reach their highest AA title.  And those that do want new challenges would have &quot;special&quot; content just for them.  It would allow those people, and those guilds, to feel challenged and elite while at the same time allowing the people who don't want to advance to that level enjoy the game as it currently stands. <p><center><img src="http://www.darke.net/journalpix/bearne.jpg"><BR>

And I think that would be part of the attraction of creating &quot;expert classes&quot; that get *tons* of benefit from their own zones that no one else can get in to, but no tangible benefit (no XP/AA, the gear is inferior for them) from the existing zones.  <br>
<br>
I think that the rare spawns that nobody outside of the largest guilds get to see now, not because they are incapable of getting to them but because they can not assemble a large enough group fast enough, would probably remain up and available much longer.<br>
<br>
I do think that they only way it would work effectively is if someone who made the decision to move up to Expert Class not only did not receive XP/AA points but also had a form of trivial loot code put in for the existing zones.  Otherwise, you would still have the same problems - a named rare spawn that TSO or MW or whoever had planned on killing on Thursday night at 9PM EST gets farmed for &quot;twink gear&quot; by a single group of post-60th characters a hour beforehand, cuz they were bored and Bob's lvl 55 Cleric really needs Frank's Breastplate of Uberness.<br>
<br>
I thought that the Trivial Loot Code as it had been implement pretty much stunk.  The difference here is that the move to Expert Class would be entirely voluntary and the results known up front, as opposed to the TLC that was forced onto everyone after the fact. <p><center><img src="http://www.darke.net/journalpix/bearne.jpg"><BR>

<br>
uber guilds will raid for about 30 to 50 hours a week (is that figure right? how much does Visions raid?).<br>
<br>
a casual raiding guild (CRG) will raid about 8 to 16 hours a week.<br>
<br>
there are usually 1 to 3 uber guilds, and 4 to 10 CRGs, per server.<br>
<br>
for the most part, the uber guild will spend that time killing the stuff with the best reward per unit time, and will rarely be beaten to the punch on that by CRGs.<br>
<br>
almost all the stuff with the best reward per time is on several day or one week timers. <br>
<br>
as tactics get refined so stuff gets killed quicker, the content that the uber guild will kill in that 30 to 50 hours keeps going up. At some point, they may be able to kill all the uberguild appropriate content in SoV and SoL every week.<br>
<br>
when an uber guild goes after something that a CRG can kill, they will do that much faster than the CRG. So if they are reduced to doing this, they will 'use up' a lot of usable content in a short time, leaving very little for the CRGs to do.<br>
<br>
CRGs will then start to die out, leaving a game world that resembles the economy of a banana republic. No middle class, only uber guild members (the ruling class) and casual gamers (the plebs). Every so often a plebian will be elevated to the ruling class, by getting to joining an uber guild as a relacement for someone who left the game. <br>
<br>
Is that a fair statement of the problem? <br>

<br>
That is exactly what happened. And it is far from enjoyable. Especially when you're not a melee. In my next extremely balanced equation, I will state that... Sleepers Tomb = Hellhole<br>
<br>
The only plausible way that I can see to introduce a higher level limit, or something with such a huge affect, is to make new zones for the higher level limit, and to make the higher level limit ONLY in affect when you're in those new zones.<br>
<br>
Thus, when you zone out, you're back to level 60. But when you go in, voila, you're level 70 with cool new abilities.<br>
<br>
This accomplishes nothing, of course.<br>
<br>
EverQuest is running out of room to expand. But, as you see on our server before your very own eyes, the playerbase is getting high level, and fast. Thus, more high end content is the only way to expand.<br>
<br>
Another problem with Cicely's idea, is that some encounters are not meant to become repetitive and tedious. You are, after all, slaying a huge mighty dragon. If it respawns every 8 hours, it becomes as meaningful as Vindicator or a Master_Of_The_Guard_028.<br>
<br>
I'm personally rooting for EQ2 to come out, and the sooner the better. The more content they add, the more fuxored the old content gets.<br>
