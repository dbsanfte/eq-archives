<br>
                     It may be too early in the game to give a good critique, so I may be talking out of my ass, but I'll post a few<br>
                     things anyways  <br>
<br>
                     My thoughts:<br>
<br>
                     The goods:<br>
<br>
                     -Game ran flawlessly (with minimal lag), although I suspect you need a pretty beefy box to accomplish this.<br>
<br>
                     -When it rains, I can still f&amp;*^ing see for miles = good.<br>
<br>
                     -Limited CR. When I died I found myself back at my bind point fully clothed = good.<br>
<br>
                     -Horseback riding = good, even though it is on auto-pilot.<br>
<br>
                     -PLENTY of MoBs to kill = good.<br>
<br>
                     -Tight graphics, 4 out of 5 stars.<br>
<br>
                     -Dowtime is 1/3 of what it is in EQ = VERY good.<br>
<br>
                     -Seems all classes can solo if you don't have enough time to start a group = good.<br>
<br>
                     -Doesn't appear that you need to worry about food and drink = good.<br>
<br>
                     -Tons of Non-aggresive mobs in the newbie areas that will not assist each other = good.<br>
<br>
                     -Much smaller death penalty than in EQ = good.<br>
<br>
                     -Anyone can bind themself = good.<br>
<br>
                     -It may be too early to tell, but it seems that the motivation to 'camp' things has been eliminated. = VERY<br>
                     good!<br>
<br>
                     -You can color your armor, and it's EASY = good! Promotes uniqueness in appearance.<br>
<br>
                     -WAAAAAAAAY more than eight slots available for spell gems = VERY good!<br>
<br>
                     -Twinking just isn't worth the effort. This is good in a way, and bad in a way.<br>
<br>
                     -NEVER ZONE AGAIN - WOOOOT!<br>
<br>
<br>
                     The bads:<br>
<br>
                     -Very addicting, this eats into the time I could be spending with my beautiful girlfriend.<br>
<br>
                     -May be too early to say this, but the interface seems clumsy and cluttered to me. Perhaps it is the 'trying to<br>
                     teach an old dog new tricks' syndrome. EQs interface is much, much better.<br>
<br>
                     -In first person combat I don't see my characters arms swing the weapon out in front of me, this is VERY<br>
                     annoying to me for some reason.<br>
<br>
                     -For caster classes, a lot of the spell gems look the same. = VERY bad. You thought Mythic would have<br>
                     learned from EQ *sigh*<br>
<br>
                     -I don't like the way you loot things. You have to click on each individual item (which appears as a bag on the<br>
                     ground) and hit the g key. This gets old real fast.<br>
<br>
                     -So far it seems that the loot and loot descriptions aren't nearly as expansive as EQs. This is one of my<br>
                     biggest attractions to a game like this. When I click on an item I want to see a boat load of neat-o stats. I am<br>
                     a stats guy, and it seems that the loot I have found so far doesn't cater well to the 'stat guys'. Perhaps this will<br>
                     change later in the game when the good loot starts to drop.<br>
<br>
                     -The inventory screen sucks ass. The item icons are bland and boring, very generic looking. I much prefer<br>
                     EQs inventory screen.<br>
<br>
                     Conclusion:<br>
<br>
                     I'm not going to pull any punches here. At this point, I think that EQ is the superior of the two games for a<br>
                     number of reasons. But DAoC has a TON of things I do prefer over EQ. Keep in mind it took over 2 years for<br>
                     EQ to become what it is. DAoC is in the very early stages, there will be many patches I'm sure, to fix some of<br>
                     the issues I have mentioned. I must admit, I have only played the game for about 3 hours total, so I may need<br>
                     to give it more time, and get used to the new interface.<br>
<br>
                     For now, DAoC will be a fun diversion when I can't find anything entertaining to do in EQ. Perhaps that attitude<br>
                     will change once I spend some more time in DAoC. So bottom line is, I think I have to spend a little more time<br>
                     with DAoC to really see what the game has to offer, but for now the above comments reflect exactly how I feel.<br>
<br>
                     What does everyone else think so far about DAoC? <p>Abattoir Shadowveil<BR>

<font color=yellow>-May be too early to say this, but the interface seems clumsy and cluttered to me. Perhaps it is the 'trying to<br>
teach an old dog new tricks' syndrome. EQs interface is much, much better.</font color><br>
<br>
I personally like the interface.  I think it is very intuitive, and very simple for an otherwise complex system.  Lots of things thrown into there, but nicely placed and easy to get to.  Merely my opinion, of course.<br>
<br>
<font color=yellow>-I don't like the way you loot things. You have to click on each individual item (which appears as a bag on the<br>
ground) and hit the g key. This gets old real fast.</font <br>
color><br>
<br>
Actually, you can just double-click the bags on the ground, you do not need to hit G.  The auto-split in a group is very very nice, especially when hunting newbie mobs.<br>
<br>
<font color=yellow>-The inventory screen sucks ass. The item icons are bland and boring, very generic looking. I much prefer<br>
EQs inventory screen.</font color><br>
<br>
I think the actual item-icons are kind of dull, agree there.  However, The Inventory Screen in EQ, being that its just three or four rows of boxes...is kind of tacky I think.  Sure, the item-icons look kind of cool, but I like DAoC's inventory layout a lot more, personally.<br>
<br>
I played DAoC for 5 or 6 hours last night, and I have to admit, I had a blast.  It was a very enjoying game, along with a game that looks great.  Sometimes its hard for companies to match those two very important things.  DAoC combined gameplay and graphics in a superb way.<br>
<br>
Another thing that everyone should realize, is that the PvE aspect is merely the pre-game show.  I can definitely say that the PvE experience will probably not match EQs, although I am sure I am speaking too soon.  However, the entire point of DAoC is PvP and Realm Points.  I honestly think its much too early to critique this game.<br>
<br>
Furor and FoH were on a campaign to destroy DAoC's existence, even before seeing what the game really has in store for us.  Oh well, hopefully they're not going to play.. =)<br>

&quot;-I don't like the way you loot things. You have to click on each individual item (which appears as a bag on the ground) and hit the g key. This gets old real fast.&quot;<br>
<br>
Or you can just hit F7 to select the bag and g to grab it.  With one finger on each key, you can pick up a dozen bags in a matter of seconds.<br>

But the other gripe I have would be that if I kill a mob and it drops 3 things, and I only want one of those things, I am forced to pick up a bag one at a time till I get the item I really want. The bags all seem to fall to the ground and stack on each other. Is there a way around that?<br>
<br>
Another thing that is bugging me is the way mouse look is implemented, I just can't seem to get the hang of it yet. Ahh well like I said it is early to critique this game, but the mouselook thing is killing me <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Overall the game does look very nice though... time will tell if it actually pulls me away from EQ. I want to be clear though, I am just nit-picking, I am not anti-DAoC in any way. As a matter of fact I was really HOPING it would be the EQ killer I was waiting for. I am pretty certain that Mythic will fix these minor gameplay issues... we shall see. <p>Abattoir Shadowveil<BR>

I hate to admitt it but I agree with D (the eternal flamer :P)  <br>
<br>
One of his goods was anyone can bind anywhere, so is there less diffrence or uniqness in the classes, will everyone be meshed together?<br>
<br>
Another is never having to worry about food and water.  What does this mean your a machine or is food free?<br>
<br>
Another one is his comment about less aggressive mobs.  So you mean to tell me you have to watch you back less and not have as much worries?<br>
<br>
Another is less downtime so this means everyone with mana has auto clar II and if so at higher levels youll be able to take on or solo hard uber mobs.  Will soloing be so great that groups will be less?<br>
<br>
I havent played the game yet so i cannot say its bad or good but i can make my opinions off of the observations made.<br>
<br>
Seems to me that DAOC is just a NERFED crowd pleasing version of EQ.  They are nerfing the mobs, nerfing uniqueness (only in binds that i see so far), nerfing grouping because of seemingly easier mobs and less downtime.<br>
<br>
But this is just IMHO<br>

<font color=yellow>Everything you described in the "good" section... Said that it was easier then EQ, not as challenging.. Which means everyone will get everything done, and there will be nothing left to do.. in 3 months.. Mark my words... I like a challenging game.. </font color><br>
<br>
Later followed by this:<br>
<br>
<font color=yellow>Yes, I think some things in EQ are challenging.. What level are you? Do you have your epic? and how much plat do you have? </font color><br>
<br>
<br>
I like posts like this, because its a perfect example of judging a game without either playing it, or playing it long enough.<br>
<br>
First of all, DAoC's main attraction is NOT....I repeat....NOT....PVE!!  The PvE is a build-up to the PvP.  Basically, PvE is the 1-50 EQ game, with the PvP being the post 50 game.  In EQ, the real game is post 50, right?  Well that's what the PvP is in DAoC, its the real game.  Contrary to what Dauragon believes, I think that fighting people, with people, will always be a lot more interesting then fighting the Sleeper, or N-ToV.  I don't think that will get boring in 3 months, as a matter of fact, I am pretty sure it won't.<br>
<br>
Oh, about the plat remark you made....what's your point?  Do you know anything about money or tradeskills in DAoC?<br>
<br>
Another point about EQ......it's public knowledge that it takes a lot of time, and a group of competent people to accomplish most everything.  PvP is where skill is at.  You have your epic?  Well if that makes you so skillful, go onto RZ/TZ/VZ/SZ and rip up some PvP action.  <br>
<br>
You're not too skilled if you can't do that.. =)<br>

<br>
        Also there's no channeling ability, if something hits you, you stop what you are doing.<br>
<br>
        While HP and mana regen fast, hp goes down fast as level 11 mobs are hitting for 30-50. Tough on healers to keep people alive when fighting high conned mobs.<br>
<br>
        The system message box is cluttered, tough to follow all thats going on.<br>
<br>
        EQ's interface is way nicer.<br>
<br>
Final Synopsis: Good game, right now not better than EQ, but give it some time.<br>

<br>
You can map a button to select objects on the ground and a button to pick up objects.  All you need to do is be by the bags and press these two keys back and forth untill you pick it all up.  You will drive yourself CRAZY trying to double click on everything.<br>
<br>
When you use the &quot;select nearest object&quot; button it gives you the name on target, so you do know atleast the name of the item.<br>
<br>
I would map these keys close to each other and just rapidly press them back and forth untill you have the loot =P <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uknobb.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Knobb</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_lightning.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 204<br> <font color=#E9D756>(10/11/01 8:38:21 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.knobb.50megs.com/images/sidesig2.jpg WIDTH=97 HEIGHT=155></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: DAoC, initial opinions/thoughts.</span><hr size=1> I, personally, dont believe EQ gets challenging until 50+;  although, I haven't gotten there yet to see.

Up until 50, it is just exp exp exp, and that might take a long time, but isn't much of a challenge. I do see how planes and dragons can be more of a challenge, though. <p><center><I><b>Inventories:</b></I><BR>

<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> One of his goods was anyone can bind anywhere, so is there less diffrence or uniqness in the classes, will everyone be meshed together?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Any class can bind themselves at specified bind stones. The ability to bind isn't a class defining skill, and it in no way makes each class less unique. In EQ terms, would giving bind to warriors blur the line between themselves and wizards?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Another one is his comment about less aggressive mobs. So you mean to tell me you have to watch you back less and not have as much worries?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
When you're Level 1, killing rats, bats, and snakes in Freeport, did they agro you?<br>
The same is true in DAoC at low levels. As you level up, you will meet mobs that agro you, that assist each other, and &quot;Grouped Mobs&quot; that travel together and attack together (cannot be &quot;split&quot;).<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Another is less downtime so this means everyone with mana has auto clar II and if so at higher levels youll be able to take on or solo hard uber mobs. Will soloing be so great that groups will be less?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
There is alot less downtime in DAoC. There's nothing wrong with that.<br>
<br>
As for people choosing to solo instead of grouping? As you level, you'll see that while soloing is possible, grouping is much more productive and more fun.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> EQ owns DAoC as far as the gear goes... Their gear is like buying from vendors or a tradesklill exclusively, though I suspect it will get better as people continue to level.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Armor drops from mobs (cloth at low levels up to mithril at mid levels). If you're looking for items that boost stats, they're available through quests.<br>
Most 'named' mobs don't drop special loot, so there's nothing to 'camp', and no items to 'farm'.<br>
<br>
Personally, the loot system is one of the things I dislike the most.  I think DiabloII has the ideal loot system (randrom drops from random mobs, rare items, unique items, artifacts).  DAoC is on the right track, but it leaves much to be desired in that respect.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Seems to me that DAOC is just a NERFED crowd pleasing version of EQ.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
I don't really see how DAoC is a &quot;Nerfed&quot; version of EQ. Some would argue that it's an &quot;Improved&quot; version.<br>
<br>
And what's wrong with a game being &quot;crowd pleasing&quot;?  Would you rather play a game that you hate?<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
All that said, I'm not sure I'll buy the game.  I was pretty bored with it after a month of beta... but I never did try PvP.  DAoC is superior to EQ in alot of ways, but again, there are a few things about it that I just don't like.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ubenedictus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Benedictus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 97<br> <font color=#E9D756>(10/12/01 12:00:03 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> hmm</span><hr size=1> Tradeskills actually Offer Cash Rewards and training them is tied with little Task quests to keep it diversive, a big improvement over EQ I think.<br>

<br>
You can thank the beta testers for this one(I sent at least 3-4 email on this topic). There used to be just one type of rain that was very EQ-like, Sudo dubbed it Super Fog™. Now there are, roughly, 4 degrees of rain ranging from drizzle to a torrential downpour.<br>
<br>
<font color=fff00>-Doesn't appear that you need to worry about food and drink = good.</font><br>
<br>
The game is Affliction-raid-friendly.<br>
<br>
/poke<br>
<br>
<font color=fff00>-Much smaller death penalty than in EQ = good.</font><br>
<br>
I wouldn’t suggest tossing yourself at ever purple-scowling Frog you come across, death begins to get bad at the 30+ levels. You lose Constitution every time you die post level-6(lose 1 Con for first death, 2 for second and 3 for every other death in the level), you pay a Healer in town to restore this(Con affects your hps, so you want to buy it back). At level 6 it costs 33 coppers to buy back 1 point of Con, at level 35 it costs about 3 gold. That doesn’t sound like a whole lot, but you have to remember that the economic system of daoc is a lot different than EQ. At level 37 in beta, the most money I ever had was 87 gold. So if I died 3 times in that level I was looking at loosing about 20% of my money.<br>
<br>
Dying = bad<br>
<br>
<font color=fff00>-In first person combat I don't see my characters arms swing the weapon out in front of me, this is VERYannoying to me for some reason.</font><br>
<br>
Yep, first person sucks ass. We told them, hopefully it gets changed sometime soon.<br>
<br>
<font color=fff00>Another is less downtime so this means everyone with mana has auto clar II and if so at higher levels youll be able to take on or solo hard uber mobs. Will soloing be so great that groups will be less?</font><br>
<br>
Never, in a million years, will soloing grant more exp than grouping(unless your group sucks, of course). There is code in the game to prevent kiting, something will only chase you so far before it turns and RUNS the other way.<br>
<br>
There is also group-friendly code built into the exp system. This both encourages grouping and deters camping. Let’s say your group comes upon a campfire surrounded by some tents with 8-9 mobs in the camp. Considering the fast respawn rate of daoc, this would be an ideal camp to set up shop at all day/night just like you would in EQ, but wait… When you kill a mob there is a base amount of exp you get, following that can be two bonuses to exp. You might see:<br>
<br>
<b>You get 805,706xp (205,821 group bonus) (150,709 camp bonus)</b><br>
<br>
Those are very good numbers to see, you got about 350,000 exp in just bonuses due to certain things. The group bonus means you pulled more than 1 mob at a time(BaF – Bring a Friend code, as named by the Devs. The amount of spawns that come after you is in proportion to your group size) and the camp bonus is an amount of exp the mob accrues while sitting there, not being pulled. So as you camp this area for a length of time the exp will begin to diminish as you lose the camp bonus. The game knows you’ve set up shop, time to move around a bit.<br>
<br>
<font color=fff00>Seems to me that DAOC is just a NERFED crowd pleasing version of EQ. They are nerfing the mobs, nerfing uniqueness (only in binds that i see so far), nerfing grouping because of seemingly easier mobs and less downtime.</font><br>
<br>
Thanks for the input EQ fanboy. Go back to sitting 15 minutes to regain mana/hps, Ill be over here killing shit in the meantime.<br>
<br>
<font color=fff00>EQ owns DAoC as far as the gear goes, bards don't wear plate = \. Their gear is like buying from vendors or a tradesklill exclusively, though I suspect it will get better as people continue to level.</font><br>
<br>
Wow, what a heinous crime to give people the ability to buy gear(that’s useful) from a vendor! I so enjoyed all those people in Cazic Thule trying to KS each other for that piece of Rubicite, but that was before your time. You can only buy useful gear up until, roughly, level 30 and then you need to start looking to mob-drops and player made from then on.<br>
<br>
On that note, the BEST gear in the game is(don’t fall over) player made. That’s right kiddies, if you put in the time as a crafter you can supply the people of your realm with the best items attainable. I'm sure there are a few mob-drops that will compete, but on the grand scale the player made equipment rules all. I know, it’s horrible that a skill actually becomes beneficial the more time you put into it as opposed to more of a waste of time, like, ohhh, EQ smithing…<br>

but in the short time i've played daoc (beta 4 + retail). I've come to the conclussion that it gives me the same amount of fun and feeling of progression that I got from EQ. I'm not saying that they are similar (they are only similar in respects to genre). <br>
<br>
  I've been playing with my new guild the past couple of days lvling, something i didnt do in beta much. I've realized that grouping in Daoc is far more complex then EQ due to the complexity of each character something I can't say for EQ. Obviously I'm not going to be able to accurately compair the to games for another 3 years, I don't think anyone can.<br>
<br>
The only negative thing I can say is that specializing for pve and rvr can be totally different. This makes it difficult when deciding where to spend your points. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uulujainebonelphette.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ulujain Ebonelphette</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_cyanspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 287<br> <font color=#E9D756>(10/12/01 6:22:39 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://members.home.net/cybiades/syzsig.jpg width=94 height=308></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: hmm</span><hr size=1> How do they configure PvP in this game?

There are 3 realms and as a member of one realm you can only attack a member of another realm.  There can't be any grief killing because you can't communicate between realms and you will never see the other players true name.  All you see is "an Albion Invader" etc.  They have put alot of thought into the pvp issues.  You can't really gloat over your defeated foe or anything all you can do is brag to your buddies in the same realm.  It makes pvp more impersonal and that is probably a good thing.  They have pretty much made it so that you are fighting another live player who may in all outward aspects seem like just another computer generated character.  Seems clever but I never got to that point in the beta.  Spent my time creating and playing most of the classes to see which I liked best but then lost interest.<br>
<br>
I think you can begin to pvp at level 15.  The first 20 levels are designed to be go fast and then they slow down.  It is a visually stunning game but you can still spend lots of time running around.  I hear there are carriage rides or something but I never found them.  Think you talk to the stable masters about it and give some silver.<br>
<br>
I'll stick to EQ until something really new comes along.  Something of a different genre like this!<br>

<br>
Oh and I don't think you can loot since when you die you return to your bind spot will all your stuff.  All that is left behind is a gravestone.  Can't loot one of those but then like I said I never did pvp.  Never saw any PC corpses out there either except right at death.  When you /release you go back to your bind point.  Think you can be ressed before that though.  It is just too similar and to different, from EQ, for me to get into.  Played alot for a week but once I figured out most of the gameplay I got a bit bored.  Still seems much better than AO though.  Just staying online was the challenge in that game. <p>Atri Drumrunner<br>55 Bard</p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/bemarr.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=ogma>Ogma</A> at: 10/12/01 9:33:41 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/udelusionn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>delusionn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 145<br> <font color=#E9D756>(10/12/01 7:45:16 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: hmm</span><hr size=1> I've heard although i can't confirm this because i didnt do much pvp in beta but the rumor has it that when you accumulate 50 realm points the other realms can see your name from that point on.
