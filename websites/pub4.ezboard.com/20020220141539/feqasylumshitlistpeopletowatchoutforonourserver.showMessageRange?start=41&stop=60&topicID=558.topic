What you take away from EQ that IS REAL, is the feeling that you spent some quality time with some quality people from all around the world. In your case however you now take away something else, the feeling that a lot of quality people think you are useless slime to be ignored at best. A new Wurm can or will be provide most likely to your victim as the Guild your dealing with is very well stocked with something you are not. In the end &quot;You will lose&quot; as you put it to Worthy in the original post but in ways that count and you probably can't understand. Any character you create will be transparent, your personality will give you away no matter what mask you wear. I think at this point the best thing for you to do is return the Wurm and then go kill yourself. If you lack the courage I'll be happy to bring my Necro out of retirement to do these things for you. <p><center><Img src="http://members.home.net/d3south/cin.jpg"></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uexmatren.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ex Matren</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>n00b!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(6/4/01 1:42:27 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Luminescence.

No this doesn't make it right. Maybe it is that I do trust a lil to much. I will not let something like this happen again but, I will not stop trusting people. Trust is what is needed in this game. Trust that the cleric will heal you at the right times, that the warrior will keep the bad guys off of the casters, so on and so forth. <br>
<br>
In the end it was not the loss of the Wurmslayer in this deal gone bad that upset me. It was more when he told me "He let me do it, So it is ok."  That right there is what upset me about the whole thing. Its that thinking which is wrong with the world. I would love to be there when that becomes the defense of a criminal in court "well he let me stab him so its ok, he could have stopped me." <br>
<br>
So with that I will end this post and let the people of Norrath ponder the happenings that occurred. So ends the post.<br>

It is so easy to be mean, selfish etc. it is so much harder to be kind patient etc. So you choose the easy way cause you lack strength and intelligence. This was fun for you? wow you really do need a life! You cause a moment of unhappiness for others, and they move on to better things, but you cause alot of unhappiness for yourself that you can never escape, and dont bother to tell me you are a happy person, cause a happy person does not feel a need to cause misery in others. I think you must be young, and I am sad that you dont have better parents cause maybe if you did you would not feel such a NEED for attention even if it is negative. I suggest you DO cancel the account and talk to your parents and get some counseling FAST! If this character you portray extends to real life (and I am sure it does) life will only get worse for you. Soon you wont even get negative attention, people will just dismiss you as a waste of human skin, how sad <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  and they will go on to spend time with friends and family laughing and enjoying life while you end up lonly and sad.

You're sitting here telling me how sad I am, how I only like to cause misery...blah blah etc.  Here's some more for you to chew on.<br>
I've played the patience and kindness game before.  It was fun for a while...untill I started running into assholes.  I put up with that for a while, and then I ran into more assholes.  No matter how nice I was, it was always some asshole ruining my fun.  And I continue to be nice, because as I said before, I'm not a bad guy.  I'm the guy that is mediating the situation.<br>

I think it's pretty nice of you folks to try to help Brashear get his wurmslayer back, but don't be so hasty.  The situation isn't complete.  Me and him have been talking, and he knows how I feel about it.  You can all keep flaming me for a while, if you want, but stop hating me.  All will be remedied soon...well, except for my reputation, but that's my problem.<br>

As far as the new name stuff, don't worry, I've rethought my decision to quit.  I probably won't be going away anytime soon. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uphalladarlevoleur.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Phalladar LeVoleur</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t d00d!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(6/4/01 7:26:07 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Luminescence.

Troll Thief and Liar.</span><hr size=1> Please by all means dont quit....cause if you do you miss out on all the good things in store for you like...<br>
<br>
1) Running into a zone and people greeting you with /rude in shout and asking how's the swindling business.<br>
<br>
2) Less and less people willing to group with you because of you award winning personality ( damn I almost choked on that one! )<br>
<br>
3) Every raid leader on this server letting you know that you will damn sure never step foot in the planes<br>
<br>
4) People like Frank stopping by to visit ( My personal favorite! ), and guiding you to the nearest lava pit.<br>
<br>
5) And a slew of other wonderful occurances that the warm and loving community of Lanys has in store for you.<br>
<br>
So by all means stick around and get what you paid for! I am willing to bet by the time it is all said and done you are going to get a lot more than just a wurmslayer!<br>
<br>
P.S. You may want to start a Necromancer cause I think you are gonna need that extra soloing power.... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uerick99.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Erick99</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t d00d!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(6/4/01 7:32:34 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Luminescence.

Troll Thief and Liar.</span><hr size=1> Well I try to really stay out of things but considering that Worthy and just about everyone who got screwed in this are involved I would like to just say a couple things.<br>
<br>
1. First Luminescence you dumb ass should have been a blow job you pathetic excuse for a human.  You have clearly displayed the intelect of a ant in this matter.  You had the chance not only to fix this but probly 1 of the most forgiving people and guilds offered you every chance to change this, instead you try to turn this into a multiple personality disorder which I dont doubt you are a tard IRL.  <br>
<br>
2. This only furthers my oppinion of are pathetic GM and if any of u personally like him thats ur own thing I personally cannot stand him a couple people in my guild have had serious /petitions sit for 4+ days &lt;1 of them loosing there corpse due to the fact it took a extra 4days for frizz to find the time to answer him with a well your corpse has rotted&gt; my god Worthy has a damn log of the whole conversation, you do have the ability to do something, was brash wrong for trusting , maybe he was but it would be etirely different if there was no LOG of him admitting it.<br>
<br>
Im sorry but this is totally unacceptable and brash if you havent already got ur wurmy replaced I will see what we can do , and I will do everything in my power to make sure this waste of sperm is blackballed anytime I see him.<br>
<br>
I know it isnt a new thing but lately I have noticed a huge influx of begging SOBs, ppl give them scraps and 2 days latter you see them decked selling stuff and people wonder how they do it well here is a perfect example of one way they do this shit, sad thing is it happens every damn day almost.<br>
