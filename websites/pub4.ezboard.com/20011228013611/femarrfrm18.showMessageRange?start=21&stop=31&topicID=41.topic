In fact that's what this thread was really about.<br>
<br>
One of the basic tenets of the civilised world is that everyone has a right to a fair trial and measured punishment. Everyone, no matter what they did. Even Nazi war criminals were given that.<br>
<br>
I'd be very frightened of an America which, the first time such ideas were tested, decided it couldn't really be bothered with the whole &quot;justice&quot; and &quot;truth&quot; bullshit and was just going to kill anyone it liked. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uealan01.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ealan01</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 182<br> <font color=#E9D756>(9/13/01 4:32:27 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Our Freedom Has almost been taken away BITCH !</span><hr size=1> I'll speak to the WWII points and the Native American points now, in this seperate post.<br>
<br>
Cerulean summed it up quite nicely, but I'll just add that at different points in history, all nations have engaged in monstrous behavior.<br>
<br>
During times of war, many people are forced to become, or become, monsters.  I wonder, though, who stands more guilty in WWII?  The Japanese, who murdered MILLIONS of innocent Chinese through torture and dismemberment in concentration camps; ever see &quot;the Rape of Nanking&quot;?  The Germans, who attempted the systematic genocide of a segment of the human race?  Or the Americans, who were, horribly, the first and only nation in history to use nuclear weapons in an attempt to stop the mounting casualties in an unrelenting Japan?  Japan has said that they would have fought any invasion until their last citizen was dead, by the way.<br>
<br>
Why does ANY of this have ANYTHING to do with the actions of terrorists?  I simply don't understand the logic whereby you must use restraint in judging outrageous actions *today* because of &quot;sins of the past&quot;.<br>
<br>
Funny that people can sympathize with Japan over Hiroshima, but can't seem to extend the same line of reasoning to feel bad for the US today.  Japan, at the time, was a far greater force of evil than modern America.<br>
<br>
I wonder, also, if this had happened in Germany, would people be arguing &quot;well, Germany was pretty damn bad in WWII, so they can't complain&quot;.  Why is this kind of BS reasoning reserved for the US?<br>

My point is that these are semantics and arguing points like this is insensitive to people who have suffered first hand as recently as Tuesday.<br>
<br>
In the end, your own example proves my point.  THE WHOLE WORLD felt that the Nazis were monsters and they STILL received fair trials, so don't worry.  These terrorists will be treated FAR more humanely than they would EVER treat us.<br>

The so called cycle of hate is humming along quite nicely without our involment. Terrorists hate us. They teach thier brood to hate us. Thier brood teaches thier brood to hate us. And so forth. They take time and learn how and where to hit us.<br>
<br>
Lets wipe out that cycle. Sure they will still hate us. But at least thier ability to do more than throw thier feces at us will be curtailed.<br>
<br>
That and maybe just maybe, they might realise that to try and promote terror will just get them killed.<br>

<br>
Your posts stand out to me as some of the loudest and most desperate posts I've read.  I am going to address some of the most disturbing points.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  Don't put words in my mouth, I never called them normal people. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
First of all never once in my post did I use the words &quot;normal&quot; or &quot;people&quot; so, therefore, I could not have been putting the words &quot;normal people&quot; in your mouth.  As a matter of fact I was not saying you stated that they were normal people, I was only giving reasons as to why they were not.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  I never called them &quot;compassionate&quot; human beings, I just said they were human. Nice how you put words in my mouth. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
See above.  I did not accuse you of calling them compassionate human beings.  See my last statement for my thoughts on this quote.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  How many people has some of our leaders killed? I never saw anyone say that the people who killed 100,000 in Hiroshima as not being human. Oh let me guess that was justified killing innocent people as a casualty of war? <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
First of all, using Hiroshima and Nagasaki is irreleveant in this scheme of events.  This is 60 years later, generations, and a totally different situation.  The atomic bomb was used to end a war, a war which could have gone on for many more years.  It was an experiment.  It was done to save lives, a necessary evil.  If it was not done, you, or me, or any other of the 250 million Americans alive today may have very well not been born.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  Human being = homosapien = a person regardless of their acts. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Ah, well, this must be where you and I differ.  Homo sapien is a label given to the human species by scientists... an animal.  I beg of you, tell me what other animal has a soul.  Tell me what other animal has a sense of morality, of spirituality, of pride, of true and undying love.  When you find one, I'll alert the scientific community promptly.<br>
<br>
What defines us as human beings goes far beyond biology and labels.  We are caring, we have emotions, we have morals, and we have beliefs.  Every civilized person on the planet knows the basics of human morals.  Murder is wrong, stealing is wrong, etc.  These people, by their very thoughts and actions, have placed themselves outside of the normal bounds of human existance.  If I could offer some advise, read &quot;Crime and Punishment,&quot; it will offer you some insight as to the mindset of those who terribly deviate from human morality and feelings.  The fact that you said they are not compassionate human beings only intensifies my argument.  Human beings, by nature, are compassionate and emotional.  Those who have lost the sens of compassion, of right from wrong, of care for each other, are, in a sense, no longer a part of normal human activity.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  I am not condoning what they did. I just feel it is pointless to sit there and call names and say who is not a human being., when that attitude is what started this whole thing.<br>
<br>
I feel those who did this and condone this behavior deserve punishment. But to sit here and call them names, go back to grade school if that makes you feel better about yourself. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

This is one of the most hypocritical statements I've seen made in quite some time.  Calling me a child while accusing me of name calling is, indeed hypocritical.  Please think of how your statements might contradict each other before you hit the &quot;post&quot; button.<br>

As I stated in a pervious post in this thread, I too agree that the atomic bombs and this terrorist attacks are not similar enough to be compared or practicly used as analogies for each other. <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> However, notice how everyone keeps comparing these terrorist attacks to Pearl Harbor, which arn't very similar either. About the only similarities that Pearl Harbor and the terrorists attacks have, is that they were both sneak attacks, and both had massive casualties. </b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->The differences between to two are so numerous, I would require several volumns to list them all. To critisize someone for the incorrect comparison to Hisoshima now is hypocritical.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> &quot;The atomic bomb was used to end a war, a war which could have gone on for many more years. It was an experiment.

<br>
Actually all estimates at the time, and in later years, say that the war would have lasted about 1 more year, not &quot;many more years&quot;. You're right, it was an experiment. Infact it was such a huge experiment that the scientists that created it werent sure if a chain reaction wouldn't ensue spreading all over the world as the oxygen in the atmosphere was consumed. A very risky gamble to take with not only the lives of all americans, but of all humans all over the world. While its true that the bomb was in part dropped to save lives, the overwhelming reason was political. See my previous post in this thread for more details on that. The estimated cost in american lives, of a conventional invasion of Japan was somewhere around 500,000 troops. I don't know how many children and grand children were born as a result of those half million men not dying, but I agree that undoubtedly many people alive today would never have been born if those men had died in an invation. However, one thing I am sure of is that a large percentage of the US's current 280million citizens were born BEFORE 1945. Many of these men would have had children already before they went into the army and hypotheticly died. While I am not an expert on demographics, I would guess that only a small percentage of today's US popluation are alive because those men werent ordered to invade. Of course that still translates to millions of lives, but not nearly the 250milion your message suggests.<br>
<br>
I suggest that all americans do some reading on the history of WW2. I can recommend some wonderful history books if you wish. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

<br>
I agree I was not 100% accurate to say you put the words &quot;ompassionate human&quot; in my mouth but your answer to my question quoted below sounds like you made the assumption that was what I was discussing.<br>

Obviously we differ on what was meant by human, I feel your definition of human means humane, it is fine that you feel its fine to substitute this, but don't expect everyone to understand what you meant.  Besides what makes you so sure other animals do not have a soul, that statement seems VERY assuming since I have heard MANY people say animals DO have souls.<br>

I never called you a child I was saying this was childish behavior, I hope you can see the difference.  And if you think name-calling is not childish behavior then speak to behavioral specialists.<br>

Anyway I am done posting here, I have seen enough evidence to know what I am feeling and doing in MY heart and soul is the right thing to do for me.  I really don;t care to explain this since I already know what it will cause.  I only pray to God that you can all see the forest through the trees.  I can only wait and see what happens in the future.  I am scared for all of us.  <br>
<br>
Enjoy calling these people what you choose, I apologize for bringing up Hiroshima, as any other human event is irrelevant to this one.  That I agree with.<br>
<br>
I apologize for getting upset, angry or even showing the smallest sign of hatred.  That was not my intention.  I apologize for posting my question with explaining what I meant.  It was simply disagreement on the definition of a word.<br>
<br>
Peace and love to you all.  My God forgive us all.<br>

You lost me on how reffering to Hiroshima and Nagasaki is hypocritical... I only reffered to it in the sense of a third party, eg. I was reffering to how others reffered to it.<br>
<br>
Secondly I apologize for the use of hypothetical information, as something that cannot be tangible should not be used in debates such as this.  For all we know, the &quot;what ifs&quot; could be terribly off the mark.  Nobody will ever know and, therefore, the usage of this information is for the most part null.<br>
<br>
Vekra:<br>
<br>
The concept of animals having souls is truely widely debated.  When someone finds me a grasshopper or polar bear with a moral code and sense of right and wrong I'll believe it in a heartbeat.  Animals think, and love, but do not have the passion and range of emotions encompassed by the gift of human life.<br>

<br>
I can see the difference.  You never outright called me a child, that's true, but it was inferred.  This is beside the point however, for we are not enemies of each other in this battle.<br>
<br>
Lastly I have something for everyone to read.  The proverbial statment &quot;We are not guilty for the sins of our fathers&quot; can truly come into play in these events.  The focus here is not on the colonization of the new world, of the Civil War, of World War II, even of Vietnam.  The focus is now.  The focus is here.  Prescious human life was lost in the name of jealousy and envy, and this life, in the future, must be preserved at all costs.<br>

Kylien, you were critisizing others for using Hiroshiam as an analogy to the terrorist attacks. I was saying that, in few of all the comparisons people are making between the terrorist attacks, and Pearl Harbor, this critisizim is hypocritical. I am not sure if you personally did compare the attacks to Pearl Harbor. But many of your fellow americans are. And In my oppinion all 3... Hiroshima, Pearl Harbor, and the terrorist attacks are too different from each other to be used as analogies. In the end I was agreeing with you, that Hiroshima is a bad analogy when discussing the terrorist attacks, and my point was that so is Pearl Harbor. <br>

For all we know, the &quot;what ifs&quot; could be terribly off the mark. Nobody will ever know and, therefore, the usage of this information is for the most part null.&quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
