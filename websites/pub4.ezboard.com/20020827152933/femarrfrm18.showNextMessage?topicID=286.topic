Is it merely children and the schools administration taking pride in their roots and history or it is a example of a division in what is considered allegiance?<br>
<br>
<br>
OKLAHOMA CITY, January 16, 2002 - Controversy surrounds the Millwood school district tonight.<br>
<br>
&quot;...and to the republic for which it stands...&quot;<br>
<br>
You're familiar with the nation's Pledge of Allegiance, recited by school children across Oklahoma – and the nation -- each day.<br>
<br>
Now, a black pledge of allegiance posted on the Millwood school district's Website is receiving criticism and complaints from some who claim it's racist.<br>
<br>
It states...<br>
&quot;we pledge allegiance of the red, black and green, our flag...&quot;<br>
&quot;the symbol of our eternal struggle, and to the land we must obtain...&quot;<br>
&quot;one nation of black people, with one god for us all, totally united in the struggle for black love, black freedom and black determination.&quot;<br>
<br>
The black pledge of allegiance has been on Millwood's Website since the site originated in September. But recently the administration has been receiving e-mails from people who take offense to the pledge and say it promotes separatism.<br>
<br>
We've all recited &quot;one nation under God.&quot;<br>
<br>
But students in the Millwood school district - a predominantly black school district - also know a slightly different pledge that says &quot;one nation of black people, with one God for us all.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I feel that knowing the black pledge of allegiance and knowing where I have come from and how far my ancestors have came, will make me feel a lot stronger in the future,&quot; one student said.<br>
<br>
The pledge is recited to the black liberation flag - which always sits below the American flag.<br>
<br>
&quot;It by no means advocates separatism or racism or anything else.&quot;<br>
<br>
Millwood middle school principal, Nathan McGuire, says the pledge was discovered by students a few years back while researching Kwanza.<br>
<br>
&quot;It's very upflifting for our students,&quot; McGuire said. <br>
<br>
Students may find it uplifting, but others surfing Millwood's Website have been angered enough to send an e-mail.<br>
<br>
&quot;Some of them were pretty ugly and I really choose not to get into exactly what they said,&quot; McGuire said. <br>
<br>
Some people we spoke with found the pledge inappropriate.<br>
<br>
&quot;It doesn't offend me. But I think we should be a little bit more focused on our own nation, the United States,&quot; said an interested observer. <br>
<br>
Sixth-grade teacher Betty Driskill, who is white, says all teachers at the school try to build students self-esteem and make them proud of their heritage.<br>
<br>
&quot;If it means saying the black pledge of allegiance, as long as it follows the American Pledge of Allegiance to our flag - I'm OK with that.&quot;<br>
<br>
The Millwood superintendent has asked the middle school principal, Nathan McGuire, to research the origin of the pledge. So far he has not been able to determine the author.<br>
<br>
The superintendent says it's too early to make a decision about whether they will take the pledge off the Website, she will meet with the school board and go from there.<br>
<br>
General information questions about Millwood Public Schools can be directed to the Superintendent's Office at (405) 478-1336 or by e-mail to mpsd@millwood.k12.ok.us.<br>

<br>
It depends on the position one takes on the above as to if it is or not  inappropriate for this thread. Under the main heading it does state that this forum is dedicated to &quot;The terrorist attacks&quot;...but there have been many topics not related to the terrorist attacks posted and responded to in this forum. If one feels the above article tells about racism, then it can be conceived as an &quot;internal attack&quot; on America.  Moving on....<br>
<br>
I do not have any problem at all with any race being proud of their heritage. Indian, black, jewish..whatever. However, one must pick either an allegiance with the USA (if you live in the USA) or with your skin color and race. America is about every race and skin color and that is the allegiance of my understanding. The above is racism.<br>

In which case this is sedition, and the school should be razed to the ground and the rebels hunted in the streets like the dogs they are.<br>
<br>
Just kidding.<br>
<br>
But in my opinion if the Black Liberation Front (or whatever) wants to do this, then they can build their own damn schools and salute whatever they want. If the students find the ideals of seperatism uplifting, then the students can use their own money to preach it.<br>
<br>
Catholics build their own schools, Mormons build their own schools. But somehow tax money is funding this? Something is wrong with that shit.<br>

i'd even go one step further, while it'd be perfectly within their right, do you think any private school would be accredited if it supported &quot;white power&quot; prominently in its curriculum??<br>

goes both ways... teach equality, not toleration, and certainly not ethnic nation-building<br>

<br>
I lived in Africa for six years.  I assure you that blacks do practice murder and slavery.  Not to mention that lots of blacks that came to America were rounded up and sold by blacks to whites.  Beyond that no one living was sold into slavery so its time to get over it.  No one who bought slaves is alive today.  So, its time to get over that.<br>
<br>
Blacks don't deserve special treatment based on the suffering of their lineage. If you think that then should we still blame Germans for Hitler?  Should Jews get special treatment too?<br>
<br>
I don't care if you are green, blue, black, red, or white.  You live in America and you are American.  Otherwise, move along, hope you enjoyed your visit <p><table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" height="1">

Err, and neither did any of us alive today... What is the point?<br>
<br>
As Cendan said, there is no &quot;black nation&quot;.  Ya know what, there isn't a &quot;white nation&quot; either.  We are a nation of many different types of people.  If you were born here and you live here, well, you are an American.  A nation of one.  Sound familiar?<br>
<br>
To come up with some &quot;black nation&quot; is to segregate America.

A nearby community to where I live in has a strong Norse heritage. They celebrate this a lot and many signs in the community are printed in Norwegian. My community has a strong Irish heritage. I went to a school that had an Irish flag. We celebrate Irish heritage here. A city an hours drive away celebrates Oktoberfest. These are all examples of white races saying I am of X ancestory and am proud and remember my ancestors.<br>
<br>
Let me disassemble the arguments against it. <br>
Cendan says<br>
Its racism plain and simple. The pledge of allegiance represents all Americans. No where does it exclude anyone, what do you think the words &quot;one nation&quot; and &quot;indivisable&quot; mean?<br>
It excluded a lot of different religions when &quot;under God&quot; was added. The teachers stress that it is not used to advocate seperatism.<br>
<br>
Kytherion says<br>
But in my opinion if the Black Liberation Front (or whatever) wants to do this, then they can build their own damn schools and salute whatever they want. If the students find the ideals of seperatism uplifting, then the students can use their own money to preach it.<br>
It was the students who discovered it while researching kwanza. If they want to explore there past and honor those who fought for the rights they enjoy I applaud them. We teach them to honor Jefferson and Washington, do you know what they did for blacks? <br>
<br>
Gladetree says<br>
replace the word &quot;black&quot; with the word &quot;white&quot; and then just imagine how long this shit would last<br>
<br>
Replace the word black with the word Native American and less people would be complaining. We afford two standards in this country. We are eternally apologetic to the point of idiocy with Native Americans, but we still deny racism against blacks occurs to this very day. This was written by a group who fought for rights the rest of us have taken for granted. I admire the children for actually coming up with something positive from there past when all pop culture wants to show them is that blacks were slaves at one time and are pimpin' da hoes now. <br>
<br>
Poppen says<br>
Hmm..ok in a nutshell its sad..its a disgrace..and it's rediculous. This kind of action is fundamentally no different from a group of hooded white thugs walking down main street screaming white power. Sick...devisive, and smacking of a hollow struggle that no longer has a central driving force. Two hundered years ago..this would have been appropriate..but today..its a waste of time for these young black AMERICANS who should be busy bettering themselves with education rather than learning new ways to falsify a dead oppresion<br>
<br>
Two hundred years ago they would have been naked on an auction block. This is NOT ancient history. This kind of action is different. The white thugs motives are to keep the blacks down the blacks motives are to empower their youth. I look at the fact that it was brought to prominence in the school by the children as a point that they are bettering themselves. In fact I applaud the efforts of anybody able to expand history beyond the text book without changing it. <br>
<br>
Cendan further says<br>
Blacks don't deserve special treatment based on the suffering of their lineage.If you think that then should we still blame Germans for Hitler? Should Jews get special treatment too?<br>
I don't care if you are green, blue, black, red, or white. You live in America and you are American. Otherwise, move along, hope you enjoyed your visit.<br>
<br>
Do I deserve special treatment. I am part Irish and we celebrated St. Pat's day at my school. We did this because the Irish have strong roots here and it is a small community. Nobody was offended. Do you think if somebody from Britain, seeing a school with an Irish flag in the halls, who had suffered at the hands of the IRA would feel anger. Maybe, but he can fuck off. We celebrated the strengths of our culture. That was in our elementary school. I didn't even know about the IRA till several years later. A nearby town with an even smaller population has had a large influx of jews, russians and mexicans and already had strong backgrounds in Chzeckoslowhatever (can't ever remember that spelling you know where I am talking about) as well as a few other European countries. They have multicultural festivals during the summer. If we had multicultural festivals at my school it would still be Irish, this is a black school in the above example.<br>
As for giving the jews special treatment, i had an enlightening visit to the Holocaust Museum and hope I can take my kids someday to the only planned, but objected to for the same arguments as above, Underground Railroad Museum. <br>
<br>
Tell the children that what they have dug up on their ancestors past is blasphemy and evil and see how much more research they will be willing to do in the future. We are the ones taking it out of context. We view it as offensive, but read again how the children and teachers view it. Jesus fucking Christ in a country where education has become a dilemma and school violence is a national problem can we please let the children see something uplifting as just that and not be the ones to make it into an issue. In fact it says they say the pledge of allegiance as you and I know it standard anyway. <br>
<br>
You can tell them that we are one united country all you want nonetheless chances are they are going to be called nigger at some point. That is America. You can say you will never say that, but you cannot guarantee that the next person will not. In my opinion I would rather them gain racial identity through the people who helped shape their past then through some of the ways popular culture presents blacks as today. As much as I disagree with some of the teachings of Malcolm X, I would rather see a black youth reading Alex Haleys bio of him, then getting their lessons on how to deal with racial divisions from gangsta rap. <br>

<br>
Then likewise you should have no problem with white students in Georgia using federal funds to explore the glory of the Confederacy, to rewrite the pledge of allegiance, and to advocate for secession.<br>
<br>
Or with German students spending tax dollars to &quot;explore&quot; their 20th century &quot;heritage&quot;...followed shortly by a nice Heil Hitler before the rest of the student body.<br>
<br>
What's the matter, Ritta? Fair is fair.<br>
<br>
This pledge of allegiance isn't exploring a damn thing, other than the limits of my fucking patience. It's not history. It's right now.<br>
<br>
Black, white, Christian, Jewish, Moslem, red, I don't give a shit what little ethnic identity someone has or decides they have. If they want funds for a street festival of an ethnic theme, fine. That's attendance optional.<br>
<br>
Schooling isn't optional, everyone goes. So I want politics and religion kept the hell out of the classroom.They can explore it on their own time with their own money.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;We teach them to honor Jefferson and Washington, do you know what they did for blacks?&quot;<br>
<br>
We also teach them to honor Carver and King. We teach them to honor these people because they contributed to our society. Because that's factual, whereas this pledge isn't factual...it's a statement of political intent.<br>
<br>
The black pledge doesn't honor anything except the desires of the majority student body to inflict political ideals on the minority. I wouldn't tolerate it from whites, I won't tolerate it from blacks.<br>
<br>
Having pride doesn't make you right. The Nazis were some proud motherfuckers, I can assure you. Ethnic pride should be encouraged so long as the ideas it supports are SOUND. When those ideas become seditious or oppressive, encouraging the pride makes it worse.<br>
<br>
Sedition and oppression should not be encouraged in the schools. End of story.<br>

As long as a school adheres to the academic requirements of all american kids and it doesn't take money from the government I guess that it has a right to teach any extras it feels the need to.<br>
<br>
One thing doesn't change though, I view it as racist.  To be fair though, I couldn't care less about my heritage... so I wouldn't know about the motive of researching "roots."<br>
<br>
Someone mentioned the Indian Nation.  While we are on the subject I just want to say they piss me off.<br>
<br>
It is one thing to live on free land (they did own it after all) and pay no taxes.  Its another if they want money for social improvements (schools and roads), since taxes pay for those and they don't pay them.  Its another to sell tobacco and beer tax free to make profit.  Its another thing to run casinos that are illegal elsewhere to make a profit.<br>
<br>
I have respect for those who want to honor a different way of life.  Those who live in a traditional way, the "old way."  I don't respect those who use it as an excuse to make a profit. <p><table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" height="1">

My view on this was why be devisive.  Why rewrite the pledge of allegiance just to make your race feel better.  If they understood the pledge, they would understand it does already apply to them and is the best they could get...by being devisive all they accomplish is prolonging an already dead era of slavery and oppression for which there is no one to hold accountable.<br>

&quot;tuan, up until the 60s and 70s america was still segregated. white folk and colored folk. funny how so many white people feel this doesnt have a effect on racial wounds still appearant today in society.&quot;<br>
<br>
Ok and that was 30-40 years ago.  What is your point? The people who made decisions back then like that not the ones making decisions today. (in general)<br>
<br>
And no, there shouldn't be any racial wounds in society today.  The only reasons those wounds are still there is because people want to hold on to those wounds.  Heaven forbid they realise most people today had absolutly 0 control on what happened in the past.  Yet some choose to act as if we did.<br>
