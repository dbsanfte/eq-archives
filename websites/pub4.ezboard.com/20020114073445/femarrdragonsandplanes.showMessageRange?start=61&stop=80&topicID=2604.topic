<br>
How do you know Tev?  You weren't there.  I was.  I know who was in the zone and it was DG and UI.  UI certainly didn't train themselves, so if DG didn't do it, who did?<br>
<br>
If UI fucked up and it was obvious they did it, I would come here to the appropriate thread and apologize for my actions and my guilds actions or at the very least, keep my mouth shut.  I would wave the wand in my left hand to get you to look away from my right one.<br>
<br>
And are you, just like the rest of DG insane, ignoring the screen shot with Blaze and Grdy/Gol planning to train us?<br>
<br>
I knew you from when you were in PC and you were better than that.  Don't let blind loyalty cloud your better judgement.<br>
<br>
On a side note, no guild is above reproach.  Every guild I have seen has, at one time or another, shown poor judgement and done something to wrong another.<br>

But this was blatanly malicious.  <br>

Why would they try and pull his corpse specially being that they did not have a cleric in the zone to rez him ? I even rezzed them both after this , again because UI are assholes. I mean moving his corpse would this make it like UI did not see where he was originally laying and when this gm got there he would look and say no where this guy ia laying now no way he did it ?/shrug......

You were loot-hungry trash when we were leveling in CT.  You walked into places already camped by two (peacefully coexisting) groups and tried to pull any named that popped.  When you were around, 6-man groups became 5, with one person designated to see if you were trying to gank a named while we were fighting something else.  When we actually got the kills we deserved, you bitched and whined about how you deserved the loot more because you were higher level.  There's nothing surprising about you wanting UI trained.  It's the same mix of single-minded greed and a delusional sense of self-importance that you've been suffering with for years.<br>

Half of it describes this horrible incident from his point of view (to be expected) and he has every right to put some anger in there after what happened. But the other half of it is him complaining about how evil all of DG is, and how we are evil because we go ahead and kill a mob even after he calls us asspirates (and other constructive negotiation terms) and demands that we not kill it so that UI may later, and on and on. I don't see where Melkizedek erred in responding to that half (or so) of the flame, as long as he addressed the serious problem last night first.<br>
<br>
<br>
Gilgamel,<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Expect the response from Divine Grace on this to be that we(meaning every person in North America not in their guild) hoard all the other spawns, making what they do completely fair. This obviously will justify their repeated training in their eyes.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Wrong. Please see Melkizedek's first post again, as he speaks for DG (I do not, but I feel I have to add some of my own thoughts here) . We don't tolerate such bullshit from our own guild<br>
<br>
You have a legitimate beef with DG as it appears that we have fucked you over last night in some manner, and for that I am legitimately sorry. But I don't see where all this other crap that you insist on bringing up fits in. Yes, the last few Dozekars that have popped (sorry, not sure of the precise count, 5 or 6 maybe?) were all killed by either DG, or our ally guilds with help from DG. Yes, we have had a force sufficient to kill Doze with barely a casualty assembled in HoT and buffing to kill him, when you start asking then demanding that we pass on killing him so that your guild may. Oh, please. Sorry if I don't cry you a river here, regardless of how badly you want his phat lewtz. Maybe the next time Magister or MF is about to kill Statue/Tormax I will send ask them not to kill it so that DG may have a go when we get enough people on, and see how far I get. Sure, it would be nice to work something out with UI, and I hope that we get something going in the future - maybe you kill a Doze while we get statue/tormax, then we switch off the following week? Hope Magister, MF, Aff, etc. agree that this is cool, or are all on vacation that week <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Ok, my point is just that it's tough to work out a complex sharing plan among all the guilds while we are buffing to kill Doze, and I can't even imagine what such a sharing plan would be or how to implement it anyway - but maybe more creative minds than mine can come together and work something else, so I'm not giving up hope.<br>
<br>
<br>
Yaara,<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> We do not sit in tov for hours and train them . Although now i wish we had we say Ok DG in Tov ( again ) and bail .<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->I don't know who you are, but if by &quot;we&quot; you mean all of United Independant, you are completely mistaken. I am not calling you a liar, but rather I assume that you are not on top of every member of UI's actions 24/7, so I'd like to point out that we consistently have to deal with UI members in HoT while we are fighting there. Either popping open the door to check on us or hanging out in HoT itself as we hunt. We however have been very lucky and have never suffered through getting adds due to UI intrusion (well, with some non-UI we weren't so lucky, but that's not relevant here).<br>
<br>
<br>
That said, Gailen was completely wrong in opening the door. I really don't know what the fuck he was thinking. Personally I think that opening the HoT door while there is another guild in ToV is downright moronic. You make damn sure that nobody is in there before you do, and if there is somebody else there, why the fuck even open it? Never mind make sure it's safe to open it first, why even do it, what business could you possibly have that can't wait. Yet here we are, almost 1 year after Velious came out, and people still do it to us regularly. Now I find out that Gailen opened the door on UI, and it was while they were fighting Doze and led to them getting wiped out. This sickens me, honestly. Nobody deseves to be trained while fighting a tough mob, I know how badly that sucks. And to know it was a guildmate that did it... yes this is a very big deal and we take it seriously.<br>
<br>
Melkore, I don't know how well you know Gailen, maybe he has a hidden dark side that nobody else knows about. But from all I know, the guy is damn nice and barely capable of getting angry, never mind doing something like this in a fit of rage. Furthermore, I have no clue what possibly could have angered him in the 1st place.<br>
<br>
But Gailen has fought in HoT before, and should have known better than to EVER open that door with others there, nevermind if &quot;pulling Doze&quot; was called over OOC as stated above. So I don't pretend to know what he was thinking, only that we need to get to the bottom of this. True that Golgar did not &quot;control&quot; Gailen as the screenshots show him stating repeatedly in OOC, but that does not mean that DG is immune from coming down on one of its members when he fucks up like this, or that we don't need to try to make ammends for his actions. I personally think that our offer (again, see Melkizedek's post) of not killing Doze so that UI hopefully gets another shot is a good start, and I'm happy that we are looking into it. Of course, I agree that the part about expecting anything to come from the GM/guide investigation is silly, but I guess it is nice to include that part just in case.<br>
<br>
<br>
Now, enough of my silly feelings - I think can shed some light on to the NToV mob disaster. Yes, as Gilgamel stated we had 9 people in ToV, enough to pharm HoT. Yes, we knew UI was also there, and already had people in HoT, so we conceded that they beat us to the mob. But we also knew that it was approaching 1am EST, so UI may be loggin soon, and we expected more of our DG mates to start loggin on soon, and hunting in ToV was the planned activity, so we just decided to wait there. I personally avoided N and E ToV and went to check on W. To those of you who don't know ToV, it's not like Fear it can support seperate raids (I personally have seen 3 ongoing simul.) as long as everybody cooperates a tiny bit and doesn't do anything stupid or malicious. So I saw NP in checking out W wing.<br>
<br>
As I'm near the W zone out, I see XXX tells the guild: &quot;damn, I just opened a door in ToV and got beaten down by (whatever mobs)!&quot; So, right away, Coroq tells the guild &quot;hehe, welcome to NToV <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> &quot;. Then XXX said that he didn't realize that NToV started there, and I said &quot;well, I can't know for sure, but it sounds like you wandered into there&quot; and zoned out. Or something like that. So I zone back in, and I'm shocked to find that 1 or more (sorry but i didn't have the balls to get close enough to count for sure) of those psychokiller NToV mobs were on the center-side of the North door!!<br>
<br>
You see, I somehow fucked up (well, was playing on a klunky PC for the 1st time with no hotkeys up and wife nagging at me, but anyway) and wandered into NToV a while back, but made it a ways further than poor XXX before getting aggroed and instaowned. Luckily, only DG were in ToV, and I was able to get a drag and rez NP, but for XXX I was shocked to see the mobs camping outside of NToV. They must have started out really close to the door (I have no clue - maybe that's normal and maybe I made it in a ways out of &quot;luck&quot; or maybe some initial mobs were dead, or maybe I had invis on, I don't know). So anyway, there they were, and....<br>
<br>
&quot;The thing about North ToV mobs is that they corpse camp.&quot;<br>
<br>
Yep. We managed to rescue XXX without further aggro, and it was almost 1 am EST so I decided to log and visit my wife. Apparantly those mobs that XXX aggrod in an incident that I thought were just amusing caused the mess. I can speculate here, but from the stories above my speculation is as good as anybody. Maybe when DG people went to CR Gailen they managed to annoy them through some aggro quirk? Or maybe UI did the same while CRing after the Gailen wipeout? Or maybe the DG CR started it and brought it on to the UI CR? Something like that I'm guessing.<br>
<br>
<br>
Yes, Golgar and Blazestorm discussed training UI in say in front of UI people. Golgar is not retarded - belligerent yes, but not retarded. And Blazestorm is not retarded either (and actually kinda nice). So if you have played EQ before you can at least guess that they were joking - it's hardly the 1st case I have ever seen of people joking about training. Yes, it proved to be bad very bad form when an actual training occured though.<br>
<br>
But the actual training is atrocious. I'm sure it was a mistake, but that doesn't forgive it. I am a firm believer that you shouldn't be fucking around in ToV while other guilds are trying to hunt there, and it bothers me when people open the HoT door on us and it bothers me when we do it to somebody else. If nothing else, this whole mess upon UI brings the point home to me that it's not just other people, but my own guild that needs to learn to be more careful in places like ToV so that we don't risk fucking other people over. It is hard enough to fight in such places without having to worry about some fool killing your guild, mistakingly or maliciously. I can promise you that DG will be better about this sort of thing in the future - if nothing else I, 1 person in DG, will.<br>
<br>
(I don't give the actual nam<br>

To the &quot;east side&quot; is HoT, where I assume Gailen died, so I'm not sure what you mean.<br>
<br>
At any rate, it seems that Gailen's corpse was dragged somewhere, which supports one of my theories: that DG managed to gain aggro of at least 1 of the NToV mobs that was camping outside of NToV and that screwed with UI CR, or vice-versa...<br>
<br>
<br>
Again, while I'm as sure as anybody can be that this was just a stupid series of mistakes, I realize that UI was nonetheless trained and had to instead spend all night CRing, and it was still DGs fault, and this sucks ass. Regardless of who did what to whom on previous days, I do not want to be part of a guild that condones screwing up somebody else's raid, and I can assure you that I am not alone in DG with this feeling, and we will take whatever steps are necessary to stop this from happening in the future and do what we can to rectify this.<br>

NToV mobs or not, the door was opened, aggroing the battle after attack was called in OOC.  This was a malicious act, not an accident.  The timing was far too coincidental.<br>

<br>
I was one of the 9 or so DG in ToV that day.  Well as someone who was actually there Im not exactly sure what happened, or of the sequence of events, however, I am sure that none of my guild *intentionally* trained UI that night.  I will to the best of my ability recount what I witnessed and attempt to shed some light  on some of the questions.  I also have a few questions of my own.<br>
<br>
Why was DG in the zone in the first place?<br>
<br>
DG heard that Doz had popped early and we wanted to rush to HoT and *claim* it so to speak with a skeleton crew until the bulk of DG would log on.   UI however, beat us farely and squarely to HoT.  Some DG left, others stayed.  Those that stayed remained for the most part at the zone in room.  We were cracking some jokes, dueling, just having a bit of fun.  Ya see, we knew UI was gonna be leaving soon as it was late for them as a US time guild.  Lafarnir asked them what time they would be leaving but got no response.  So we decided to wait it out and monitor Dozekar's fate, and also to plan what we were going to do the day ahead accordingly.<br>
<br>
What the fuck try to explain the SS of Golg's comments then?<br>
<br>
Nothing to explain really.  It was a joke, simple as that.  There's no question DG doesn't like UI.  UI takes cheap shots at us at every opportunity.  Heh the idea of training them was amusing.  But theres no question as a guild we weren't going to do anything like that.  I distinctly remember in guildchat that golgar said, &quot;heh, nah...Im not gonna stoop to their level.&quot;  Yes, its *very* incriminating, and Im quite sure not too many people are going to *buy* this explanation.  Let the truth be said anyways.<br>
<br>
BULLSHIT, now try explaining the NToV mobs!<br>
<br>
The NToV mobs were let out of their cage by DG.  But it wasn't to train UI.  Precis, a DG paladin there that night got too close to the North Wing and got killed by 2 wyverns right before the door to north wing.  Now wtf he was doing there I dunno.  Im *guessing* he fucking went the wrong way.  Shit I have had to pull corpses of many of my guildmates from North Wing who accidentally strolled there.  And fuck i know how &quot;made up&quot; this sounds while im typing it.  Anyways, this occured sometime very very early in the night, while it wasn't quite certain yet that we were gonna lose the race to HoT.  Alontier our SK tried to get his corpse and died.  Then I tried.  Due to the fact that the 2 wyverns were facing north i could sneak right behind em and FD drag the corpses to a safe spot.  Anyways at this point, 2 North Wing wyverns, not moving, in front of the door to Ntov inside the central room.  From there they wouldn't aggro anyone taking a direct path from zone in to either West or East wings.  For those that don't know those wyverns will corpse camp for ages.  In fact I have never stayed around them long enough to actually see them move back.  I have seen them outside their cage more than a few times.  So the north wing mobs were in the central room, whether you noticed or not, long before you even pulled Doz (a few hours).<br>
<br>
Gailen the training ranger...<br>
<br>
Heh Gailen is one of the most innocent, respectful people I know.  Im sure anyone who knows him can back that up.  It just doesn't make any sense that he would train you guys.  I asked him what he was doing even near HoT while you were fighting Doz.  Well it seems he was told by Lafarnir to get closer to HoT to track for any other nameds.  He absolutely denies opening the door.<br>
<br>
Now with the information I have I can't really put together what exactly happened.  What I am wondering is tho, why did so many UI run out of HoT while fighting doz?  You know running out with doz aggroed on you will cause all the *ally* mobs to aggro right? Why not just die there in HoT?  Also in the slew of insults and comments last night, one person I believe Kolil said he ran out of HoT to see what gailen was doing.  Heh maybe he opened the door.  Anyways why were there so many corpses outside HoT? Obviously you guys at one point decided to run out. /ponder<br>
<br>
Everything I said above is the truth.  Obviously if you think im lying well, fuck I am not I swear it <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ubreusmcbaine.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Breus McBaine</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 21<br> <font color=#E9D756>(10/30/01 12:17:46 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The facts as they are.</span><hr size=1> First off I'd like to say, sorry United Independent for Divine Grace being assholes and not owning up to what they did.

Grdy again...Most people think when an officer/leader of a guild tells people to do something they do it, not to mention you were conversing with another DGer who was suggesting training something else instead.  Joking text is usually accompanied with some sort of indication, those lines of say were cold because you were pissed you weren't gonna get your little precious pharmed mob for the 6th? 7th? week straight.  And as for Khorn being KoS and causing a train...wtf?  A person running from zone in of ToV to HoT door has to go by approx. 13 mobs.  Then to get the NToV mobs there they'd have to run past more drakes into NToV, return with wyverns and what not while continuing to be beaten on by mobs in the &quot;Wing Room&quot; and the 6 from the hall before that room.  Now hmm...given a rogue's AC...HP...average running speed of a character in EQ(even with SoW)...even using a disc, this just isn't feasable(sp? /shrug).
