First, for the record, I like to melee. As long as I am FM, Buffed, and full HP, I will jump into the Frey, and add my Cad of Sacrament's blunt head to my foe's Blunt head.(hehe)<br>
<br>
I do this for three reasons:<br>
<br>
  1) Any Extra damage done to the Mob makes it die that much faster!!  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
  2) Melee increases my fighting skills. My 1HB is 169, and my Offence is 199. (Not bad for a 42nd level Cleric)<br>
<br>
  3) I like to get HIT, because, that increases my Defence rating! That gives me better armor class. That means I am harder to hit when the mobs argo on me for casting that C-Heal. It also gives me room for more wisdom based items, that might take away from my normal Armor Class.(Right now, with buffs, my ac is around the mid 700's, and, that is WITH 189 Wisdom, and Cad of Sacrament in hand)<br>
<br>
Now, as to what happened the other night in Kanor. Our party beat up the Drov Captain, and, he dropped a Jade Mace. The weapon is 9/18.<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.everlore.com/items/items.asp?mode=show&IID=129891">www.everlore.com/items/it...IID=129891</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--> Very Nice.<br>
<br>
When a Cleric is OOM, and, he cannot med, if he cannot fight, he is nothing.<br>
 <br>
As we were about to roll, one of the Warriors said that I should not be allowed to roll for it, because, I was ONLY a cleric, and, weapons are toys for me. That I should only worry about Wisdom items, just sit back and heal. Only a class like a Warrior or such should get it. <br>
<br>
I felt that I should have the same opportunity to roll for this fine weapon. I was not asking for preference, just the same chance as every one else.  I did end up getting to roll, the group voted in my favor. I lost the roll, but, at least I got to try for it.<br>
<br>
I would like input from my fellow healers.  I know some choose NOT to melee, but, does that exclude us from getting one of the few real nice weapons that we can use?<br>
<br>
Thanks for your time.<br>

The warrior/ranger etc with the mace will be able to taunt mobs so that medding is possible.<br>

If you wanted to roll because you felt everyone should get a chance and trade for what they want with it..well, thats another matter all togeather. <p>

<br>
We get single attack, with a low attack rating, low offence cap, low weapon cap, low everything dealing with melee cap.  If you are full mana, full buffs, full hps....why aren't you stunning the mob?  That is what I don't understand.  Our Stuns do DD damage, either 90 or 220 for the two I use, take little mana, and take a mob (that is double hitting for 100+) out of the fight for an average of 4 seconds a pop.  Next level I get my 8 second stun...<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I have heard the arguments many times over and it still surprises me to see Clerics that think meleeing vs. either stunning or throwing in even one nuke makes sense.<br>
<br>
I use a Truesight Hammer, the ONLY time I melee is if I am full mana, full hp, full buff and bored out of my skull.  I will then melee the SK pets in the Crypt of Sebelis or the Elementals in the Hole.  This is only due to the fact that my hammer processes Banish Summoned (585 dd) once in a blue moon.  Kind hearted Chanters have even been known at times to humor this cleric by casting Augment or AQ on me for haste...<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
If you melee because at times you are bored and just want a change from the normal operating tempo, then jump in and whack em sometimes.  But never delude yourself into thinking you are doing much in the way of damage.  I have basically max'd 1hb and offense and an AC of 920, but I know better then thinking I am a tank.  If you ever think you are really kicking butt, turn 'Other hits on' and see if you can find one of your hits, you would need to dig it out of the spam of the real tanks...<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Play as you will, this is a game for enjoyment.  But when one of the top weapons in the game drops, do not be surprised in the least if a LARGE number of people do not think you should be in the roll for it.<br>
<br>
Just my thoughts,<br>

I knew the Jade mace was good, but, did not know that it was the best weapons in the game. I do only save my Manna for buffing, healing, and, I do chain stun Casting mobs when I think that I will not risk not having enough Manna to do my healing. I do not neglect my Healing duties for the want of Melee. But, I do admit, I want to be the best I can be in all areas. Yes, I know the Tanks are doing 10X the Damage I do. But, There is some satisfaction when you know that the 200 Dammage you were able to do helped kill the Mob. And, it comes in handy when you are grouped with only Casters, and, you ARE the tank. (Been there, Done that..hehe)<br>
<br>
Clerics 1HB Max is 175, Offence Max is 200, and Def Max is 200. We are the Midrange between Warriors and Casters.<br>
(BTW, My 1HB got up to 170 today in Kaesora! Bwaa-Haaa-Haa-Ha!)<br>
<br>
I guess because there are so few really nice weapons that clerics CAN use, I was dissapointed that I was not entitled to a chance for a good one. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Also, on the chance that I did not want it for myself(which, I did) It also sells for 15-17K PP. That can buy alot of Wisdom Gear.<br>
<br>
Thank you for your input. At least you put it alot nicer than just telling me to sit back and heal, that I was not deserving. Hehe.

Anyways, as for melee'n.. One day in Karnor a Springwood club dropped (9/25 +5str +5wis I think heh) and group leader suggested it be rolled between me and the druid..and the warrior got mad.  Now I can kinda understand the warriors point - but it is a wis item.  When I am hella bored, full mana and stuff I melee.  I chain stun and heal while I'm at it.  I have had the chanter or shaman haste me and I know I do crap damage..lol you will hear me go WOOT!  I hit for 10 etcetc, or Darn!  I was going for the most misses record, but I only missed 10 times in a row lol.  But the point is, it's a change of pace, it's fun and I enjoy it when it happens. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>
<br>
My big beef is that clerics as a whole are left out on a lot of major loots, and I'm not just saying allowed to roll, I'm saying in general.  As is stands right now, if something I want or need doesn't drop I'll never get it, I can't afford to buy anything, and I have nothing to trade because I never get to roll on stuff, or more often then not never win.  Jade mace is damn nice..but I doubt I'd roll on it - I'm not a fighter..but a wis item drops I can use you better damn well believe I want to roll on it lol And darnit I'd be happy just to get my spells, but no spells to trade make it hard heh <p><p align=center><b><font size=4><font color=crimson>~Aindia Crimsonwind~</b></font><br><font size=2>51st Cleric of Tunare</font><br><b><font size=2>Member of     <a href=http://geocities.com/thechosenclan target="web">The Chosen Clan</a></font></b></p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/beqasylum.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=ash>Ash</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Fire Beetle</span><br> <font color=#000033>(9/16/00 4:27:01 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumcleric.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=28.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Weapons for Clerics</span><hr size=1> hehe i had 5k plat before our PoA raid, and that was from scrimping and saving for i dont know how many months.

<br>
Well well well ... this is topical for me.<br>
<br>
Tonight in Karnor, I was in a pick-up group and the Jade Mace dropped. It was decided (I was not the group leader, the leader was a warrior, and a very nice person as well) that all six people could roll on it (WAR WAR CLR ROG BRD DRU). I was lucky enough to win the roll and so the Jade Mace was given to me.<br>
<br>
I was *very* happy. Not because I was thinking &quot;Gee I can sell this for megabucks&quot;. That's not me at all. But because I was thinking &quot;Now I am one step closer being able to roleplay the battle cleric I always wanted&quot;. Yes I know Verant have stuffed Clerics on the melee front and all the rest of what is said above, but this doesn't mean I have to buy into it; if I want to build the best melee-capable cleric I am able I can and will do so, as it is all part of the self-image of the character I love. If someone else thinks differently, well, do as you like with your own character is what I say.<br>
<br>
Now I will permanently carry around with me my Jade Mace, my Springwood Club and my Cone of the Mystics, to interchange between them for given circumstances.<br>
<br>
I'm glad the group I was in when it dropped didn't have any of the pre-conceived opinions represented in a couple of places here on this thread (and elsewhere), or I'd not have met my aim this evening or been as happy when I logged tonight.<br>
<br>
On the general point tho, I have this to say. I broadly support 'Need before Greed', i.e., Warrior-only item goes to a warrior in the group if there is one present and he has not got it and would equip it if he had it.<br>
<br>
But if the item drops that is multi-class, where members of more than one class who *could* use it are present, and those members *would* equip it if they were to get it, then members of all those classes should get an equal roll. This is my view and I'd enforce it if I were group leader, as to arbitrarily exclude one class for some judgement reason that class A could make more use of it than class B is unfair in my books.<br>
<br>
This means whether it be a Jade Mace or a Springwood Club, a cleric and a warrior should both get a roll on both if they would equip them (not if all they were going to do was sell them mind you). This allows characters to have their own aspirations (god forbid a bit of roleplaying!) to equip themselves as they so please.<br>
<br>
Thank you and goodnight.<br>

<br>
What happened in my opinion was just sad.  By your arguments then Feli I truly feel sorry for any tanks in your group if an all/all haste item drops.  I am sure you would find a way to justify taking it also.  It has nothing to do with Role Play.<br>
<br>
The fact is that there was a warrrior in the group, equipped with YAKs, and he is a very nice guy.  The Jade Mace is one of the best warrior weapons in the game.  The fact that he has to go around knowing that a CLERIC decided to roll and keep the item makes me feel bad for the rest of the clerics on the server.<br>
<br>
If they had decided that all would roll, and to be honest the only way I could see this happening is if the leader wanted an easy way to justify thier OWN roll on the item, I would have rolled just to give the warrior and extra shot at the item.<br>
<br>
You have just reminded me of the main reason I rarely if ever do pick up groups anymore.  Thank you for that at least.<br>
<br>
I am going to attempt to purchase a Jade Mace on the server and give it to the warrior in question (yes I know who he was).  There were actually two warriors in the group, one well equipped, one with what you may expect to see on a warrior, at that level, not in a powerful guild.  If I am able to get my hands on it I am going to make it a gift to him and explain that not all of us are about ubering our clerics.<br>
<br>
Not going to write the rest of what I wanted to, I just think this was very sad.<br>

I believe I stopped, seriously, meleeing at lvl 34, as that was why Verant gave me a pet.  My piddly 1-25damage every few seconds over the course of a battle does NOT even come close to damage a lvl 52 warrior using a nice 2h slash weapon can do.  Also, being a shaman, my buffs make me almost never fm.  Typically, i keep dex (100), agi (100), str (100), sta (100), tuna (250), guardian (150), and alacrity (115) (if not grouped wif an enchanter) on all melee (pally, sk, war, rogue, ranger, bard) and guardian, sta, agi and tuna on the healers/casters.  Plus keeping the buffs on myself plus regrowth (300) so I can canaballize for mana if needed.  In addition to this, casting Turgur's Insects (275) on every mob I can to make the healer's life easier also eats mana.  I do try to cast buffs in waves, but still even casting the a wave of Guardian is 900 mana (about 1/2 of my total).  <br>
<br>
How much damage can a buffed lvl 50 warrior do with a jade mace over 2mins of fighting?  Now how much damage can Mr. Cleric do?  Or Mr. Shaman?  Or Mr. Druid?<br>
<br>
It sickens me to see clerics thinking they need a non-wis/mana uberweapon so they can melee more.  What's next?  Mages begging to be in rolls on FBSS so they can do more damage in melee?  I am in complete agreement wif Camdar.<br>

PS The only time I would ever demand to be allowed on a roll for a jade mace...is in situations in Felishana's and Worthy's posts.  Again, only trying to give the warrior a better chance to win it (Hell yes, I would give it to them if I won).<br>

<br>
I had posted a long and angry response. I then thought, why start a flamewar, it's pointless, so I deleted it.<br>
<br>
Really, if Camdar (or others) saw the Jade Mace as a Cleric Weapon, he would not have had a problem with Felishanna aspiring to own and use one, and asking for a roll on one. But he sees it as a Warrior weapon, and so looks on my decision (wrongly) as implying I'm some kinda of greedy uberlooter person. Those who actually *know* me as a person (Camdar doesn't) will know this not to be true.<br>
<br>
Felishanna does not see this as a warrior-only weapon. Arguments about stats are irrelevant, I am entitled to set whatever aspirations I choose for her. This includes wanting, buying, owning or god-forbid looting any item she thinks she would actually equip and use. I'm just glad that the people I was grouped with when it dropped were more tolerant of such views than some.<br>
<br>
I know you don't like my roleplay Camdar. But there is really no call for you to judge me so badly. But that's up to you. Felishanna will carry her Jade Mace with pride and happiness, it won't sit in the bank or get traded for loot, like a true uberlooter, it will be equipped and loved as much as the other items she carries. Good luck to you Worthy in trying to get one. I said elsewhere it won't be easy, especialy with the attitudes of some others set against you.<br>

<br>
Can I use it? Hell yes.  Is it a good weapon for me?  Yes. Between me, a warrior w/o one, a cleric and a druid, do I NEED it more than the warrior? No, absolutely not. There are better or equal weapons available to me, in the near future, or now with the right group in the right place at the right time.<br>
<br>
The warrior's place in the group is to focus attention onto him.  The more damage they can do, the better he/she can perform their job, which allows me to do MY job (get behind the mob and blenderize it), which allows the healer to do THEIR job, which allows everyone to be more effective with less downtime.<br>
<br>
Sorry if this conflicts with some people's roleplay aspect playstyle of clerics, but within the confines of what we are given as a game, a cleric meleeing can 90%+ of the time be doing MUCH better things with their time.<br>
<br>
I can see why Tardaan is ticked off.  <br>
<br>
In my version of a 'need before greed' group, a warrior with duel yaks has a FAR superiour need for a 9/18 1hb than a cleric that melees on the offchance that they are full mana and bored.<br>
<br>
No offense to clerics, I have grouped with MANY a wonderful cleric, and I'm always sure to give them extra cash to defray component costs, like any good meleer should. But when it comes to this particular issue, in my view, I disagree with Worthy and the people supporting him.<br>

I will say this now though, it does not surprise me in the least that you would throw your &quot;role play&quot; stance out to justify this one Felishana.  And before you throw back at me how I hate your role-play, go back and read my posts again, I did not attack your role play or your right to role play, only on how you perceive a Cleric of Tunare should act.  If I remember correctly you thanked me at the time for NOT flaming you.  I have spent a greater deal of time then you know defending your right to role play, even though you refuse to play it on a racewar server, that is probably why this last thing has sickened me.<br>

Will write a more lucid post in the afternoon on the general board.<br>

<br>
Camdar:<br>
<br>
1. I did not flame you sir, nor will I now. There is no point in being deliberately and personally nasty to another human being in a game played for fun. I can't say I won't defend my views however, for I most certainly will.<br>
<br>
2. I know you do not agree with my roleplay, that has been and is very clear. You are entitled not to. Many others do not either, so you are in good company. That doesn't mean I have to sacrifice or change it. It is for me alone to decide how to play my own Cleric of Tunare. However, I did not say you flamed me, nor did I mean to imply it; you were, as usual, polite.<br>
<br>
3. I do not actually 'justify' (as if I need to justify it anyway, but I try, out of politeness) equipping a Jade Mace purely by roleplay. That is one aspect for me yes, whether you respect it is another thing entirely.<br>
<br>
4. I point out to clarify once again, the roll I won the item on was one on which the whole group rolled. The warrior (a gentleman I must point out) who you feel was so hard done by was infact the group leader who asked the whole group to roll. Yes I would have done the same had I been group leader, though I would have restricted the roll to those who both could and *would* actually equip and use the item. This may in this case have been the whole group. Actually, this means if one ever drops in a group I lead in the future, I would remove myself from the roll, as I have one equipped already; I'd only roll if there was no-one in the group who both could and would equip it (lets face it, that's unlikely!). But that's my policy, I do not enforce it on other groups, only those I lead. If someone cannot live with the loot policy in a group, in all niceness, I suggest they join another group.<br>
<br>
5. If you or any other would have decided to give the item away on its acquisition, you would have my respect for that, if you were following your own principles. I personally have this idea I do not choose to give away something I win fairly and would actually like to use. I return to the same point &gt; if you saw this as a cleric weapon you would not judge me as you do. Not that you really have any right to judge me for choosing to equip an item you personally would not choose to equip (for your own very good reasons) in any case. By your logic &gt; I'd never be able to own and use a Jade Mace no matter how much I'd like to, for whatever petty roleplay or any other reasons I choose, including just plain wanting to, unless perhaps I managed to amass 20K+ by some freak and buy one from some item farmer. But I guess even then you would tell me I should give it away to a warrior. So I'll never be able to win in your eyes, unless I simply acquiesce to your viewpoint that a cleric should never equip one. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Sorry for disagreeing, but there you go. It's a game and part of my fun is setting my own aspirations.<br>
<br>
6. In terms of aspirations, I am entitled to aspire to any item in the whole of Norrath I wish to aspire to, irrespective of the approval or agreement of some others. I don't go round item farming, I personally hate that, but I am entitled to aim to acquire an item I want to equip and use, just like everyone else is. This actually does not include an FBSS by the way, as Felishanna has no aspiration to equip such, but if it did, I'd have every right to go camp one myself and equip and use it.<br>
<br>
7. It all comes back to the same thing &gt; peer expectation and judgement attempting to force individuals with different views to tow the party line. I apologise again for disagreenig with you sir, but I stick to my view.<br>
<br>
I commend anyone in setting goals for their character, and striving to achieve them. For the case of a cleric who wants a Jade Mace, get out there and get yourself one. No-one has the right to tell you you may never do so (even if they wouldn't themselves for a whole variety of good reasons as they see it).<br>

<br>
a) Yes, I really would have used this weapon. When I made 44, I solo'ed my first Hill giant with a combination of Fear Kiting with my Cad of Sacrament and a couple of well placed retrabutions. I then did the same thing to a Griffon.<br>
Both conned BLUE to me, and, I got EXP from this. DARN that felt good!<br>
<br>
b) It has been mentioned that you have to help out the warrior, and, in cases where it is some one I group with alot, my stance would probably sway toward them getting the item, BUT, there are times which you group with a party, which is only temporary, consisting of passing souls. You meet nice new people, but, sometimes you never see them again. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Good thing they got that mace.<br>
<br>
<br>
c) Tonight in Kanor, I heard two different times the Jade Mace being auctioned. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I know I would have used it with pride.<br>
<br>
d) BTW, I maxed out 1HB tonight at 175!! And, guess what? That felt pretty good!!!<br>
<br>
<br>
I think the Need should be looked at, but, is it always need?  Warriors do have MANY weapons options. Clerics are very restricted.<br>
<br>
Remember, Every one plays their character as they see fit.  IF we got too deep into roll play, you would never see Shadow Knights grouped with Paladans, because some one said that it should not be done. This game is ment to put people in positions that they help each other, and have fun.  I know that, when I am told that I do not deserve something, because I am JUST a cleric, and, my job is to just heal and med so the warrior can kill, I feel kind of hurt, like a second class citizen. &quot;YOU JUST STAY THERE AND MED! DO NOT GET IN THE WAY! DO NOT MELEE!! YOU ARE USELESS!! YOU CHOSE TO BE A CLERIC, NOW ACT LIKE ONE!! YOU ARE NOT PLAYING YOUR CHARACTER RIGHT IF YOU THINK YOU CAN HELP ANY BY HITTING SOMETHING!! YOU DO NOT DESERVE TO HAVE A GOOD WEAPON!! YOU ARE A BAD PERSON FOR WANTING THIS!!<br>
<br>
Makes me wanna cry. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
When I did my cleric armor quest, I had help, but, I fought along side every one that helped me, and, it felt real good to make those accomplishments. There are a few of us that like to get in there and jump in and get a little dirty! Please do not condem us or try to make us feel bad about how we like to play. We try to play in ways that bring us pleasure. It is in no way an attack upon your style of play.<br>

Any cleric that melees (or nukes) while their group is being hammered, especially if people die as a result, is a poor cleric, IMHO. But meleeing for fun (reality check: it's a game, played for fun) in situations where no-one is going to die is another matter entirely. I usually find when I melee (eg in Karnors for single pulls), most of the rest of the party find it entertaining. The fact that I roleplay a cleric who loves to get into the melee (when it doesn't endanger my group) is part of my fun. No-one has the right to instruct me to do otherwise. And as I've said before, if someone really can't live with it, for the fun and enjoyment it gives me, then there are always other groups.<br>
<br>
But this is kinda off topic a bit, as the topic was about the circumstances under which clerics should be able to roll on items they can use like a Jade Mace.<br>

<br>
But first,<br>
<br>
Will just adress your points here Felishana:<br>
<br>
&gt;1. I did not flame you sir, nor will I now. There is no &gt;point in being deliberately and personally nasty to &gt;another human being in a game played for fun. I can't say &gt;I won't defend my views however, for I most certainly will.<br>
<br>
There is no need for this to resort to Flames, would hate to see it go that way, I am not in general a person that writes flames.  Defend your views as you will, I plan to point out not only what I don't agree with but hopefully why.<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt;2. I know you do not agree with my roleplay, that has been &gt;and is very clear.<br>
<br>
Disagreement with your philosophy of what a cleric of Tunare should stand for and disagreement with your &quot;role play&quot; are two seperate issues.  If you can not see that, then I do not see how I can explain it.  Far be it from me to try and explain the difference.<br>
<br>
&gt;3. I do not actually 'justify' (as if I need to justify it &gt;anyway, but I try, out of politeness) equipping a Jade &gt;Mace purely by roleplay. That is one aspect for me yes, &gt;whether you respect it is another thing entirely.<br>
<br>
Your &quot;vision&quot; of the Battlecleric then is not justification?  Ahh my misunderstanding then, it was the only one that even came within 170 degrees of being understandable to me.<br>
<br>
&gt;But that's my policy, I do not enforce it on other groups, &gt;only those I lead. If someone cannot live with the loot &gt;policy in a group, in all niceness, I suggest they join &gt;another group.<br>
<br>
This is my biggest problem with your playstyle (not your role play) and perhaps why I let this get to me a bit more then I should.  You force your views on others by being one of the indespensible classes.  You carry on with a Paladin's attitude, but know that if you played that class you would not be able to force these things on others.  So you chose to play a class that I care a great deal for to use as your billy club to get your way with things, and refuse to do so on a Racewar server where some may have some return recourse.<br>
<br>
Your point #5 is just too long to paste and cut, so will adress it without cut/paste.<br>
<br>
No, the point is not that you would 'never' be able to win this item.  It would go to you AFTER tanks in the group with lesser weapons were better equipped.  At times like this I truly wish more Cleric required items were drop only.  Like spells.  I wish something along the lines of Sup Heal or other spells were rare dropped items and you were grouped with a Paladin who wanted to roll to take those items for their Medding Paladin.  Most of the items necessary for you to effectively play your class are gotten by traipsing into the nearest guild and purchasing them for small amounts of plat.  Warriors and other tanks do not have that option.  They have to stick to certain areas and hope and pray that an item they need to advance their character drops and others in the group understand just how important those items are for their class.  As far as the argument that the tanks will take ALL the weapons, that to me is BS.  Perhaps I have been blessed for 58 levels and grouped only with Honest and Trustwrothy tanks that will say &quot;that is a good weapon, but mine is better, so all roll&quot; when this was the case.  If you have issues of trusting your groupmates, then perhaps you should relook how you form/join your groups.<br>
<br>
&gt;6. In terms of aspirations, I am entitled to aspire to any &gt;item in the whole of Norrath I wish to aspire to, &gt;irrespective of the approval or agreement of some others.<br>
<br>
No one has ever said you didn't, it is how it is done that perhaps leaves the greater impression.  This &quot;approval or agreement&quot; you speak of is called &quot;Custom and More's&quot; on a server.  These customs come about for the betterment of the server community as a whole.  No one ever needs to follow the customs of a server/country/race/religion/etc...  But they should not feel &quot;attacked&quot; if they go against what MOST consider the &quot;right and proper&quot; thing and they are called to task for it.  I am very curious as to what your stance on Need before Greed is?  It seems to me, please correct me if I am wrong, that if Felishana feels she &quot;needs&quot; an item, even if others in a group &quot;need&quot; it much more, this is not greed in any way.  They just don't understand your role play?<br>
<br>
&gt;7. It all comes back to the same thing &gt; peer expectation &gt;and judgement attempting to force individuals with &gt;different views to tow the party line. I apologise again &gt;for disagreenig with you sir, but I stick to my view.<br>
<br>
See above.  I don't call it &quot;peer expectation and judgement&quot;.  I call it customs and courtesy.  &quot;Towing the party line&quot; at times is what is preferred to as being &quot;truly&quot; polite and caring, not just using pretty words to put that facade up.<br>
<br>
Felishana I have no idea why your recent actions (not just the Jade Mace) have bothered me as much as they have.  This is one of the reasons I am going to direct the General Board to this thread.  Perhaps I feel I defended you against friends and you are proving THEM right.  Perhaps many feel afraid to go against you as you will add them to your incredibly long &quot;no res&quot; list, well I can res myself.  We can have our debate here and go our seperate ways in game, that they will remain seperate is very obvious to me now.<br>
<br>
Worthy, <br>
<br>
I will just adress a few things to you.  <br>
<br>
When I hit 44 I also solo'd a Giant.  And yes it felt good, but it takes the 44 &quot;nuke&quot; to do it, that thing sold in the guild for a few plat.  <br>
<br>
&gt;BUT, there are times which you group with a party, which &gt;is only temporary, consisting of passing souls. You meet &gt;nice new people, but, sometimes you never see them again.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START >: --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/mad.gif ALT=">:"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ( Good thing they got that mace.<br>
<br>
Wow, what can I say.  I feel GREAT when someone even in a short term group gets an item that is rare and important for their class.  You get nothing from the fact that they are as happy as they are?<br>
<br>
&gt;I think the Need should be looked at, but, is it always &gt;need? Warriors do have MANY weapons options. Clerics are &gt;very restricted.<br>
<br>
Do you think that perhaps there is a reason they Need options?  A better weapon is a better weapon, different stats on different weapons become important for them depending on who/where they are fighting.  Do you not have a large number of spell options?  Easilly attained at the nearest guild?  Do you think that perhaps there is a reason that Cleric weapon choices are limited?  Perhaps we aren't tanks?<br>
<br>
&gt;I know that, when I am told that I do not deserve &gt;something, because I am JUST a cleric, and, my job is to &gt;just heal and med so the warrior can kill, I feel kind of &gt;hurt, like a second class citizen. &quot;YOU JUST STAY THERE &gt;AND MED! DO NOT GET IN THE WAY! DO NOT MELEE!! YOU ARE &gt;USELESS!! YOU CHOSE TO BE A CLERIC, NOW ACT LIKE ONE!! YOU &gt;ARE NOT PLAYING YOUR CHARACTER RIGHT IF YOU THINK YOU CAN &gt;HELP ANY BY HITTING SOMETHING!! YOU DO NOT DESERVE TO HAVE &gt;A GOOD WEAPON!! YOU ARE A BAD PERSON FOR WANTING THIS!!<br>
<br>
Wow again.  You feel that if you aren't tanking that you are a &quot;Second Class&quot; citizen?  Being perhaps, along with the enchanter, the MOST important member of any effective group is a let down to you?  Is this how your groups talk to you?  Or is this how you percieve what they are saying when they may or may not offer constructive criticism of your role play?  Do you think you will EVER have enough mana in places like the Kitchen in Sebelis or the Disco if pulling 1 and 2 to get up and melee?  How many of these same tanks do you think had to do LONG runs (they don't get to bind right outside like us) because their Cleric was yelling OOM after being up and meleeing for the fight?  If I were a tank, and at this time thank god I am not with some attitudes progressing from this thread, and I had a Cleric in the group wanting to roll on a weapon that is so important to my class I would not think of them as being &quot;bad&quot; I would only think of them as greedy.  Not greedy in the sense of selling it for money, but greedy in feeling it is &quot;just as or even more&quot; important for me to get this, even though it has very very limited use, then it is for you to get it and use it on a constant basis.<br>
<br>
Let me ask you this, since you say so many seem to, why did you choose to play a cleric?  Do not take this as a flame, it is not meant as one, I am just curious what drove you to play a class that does not melee?  You seem to enjoy being in the kill much more then making the kill possible in other ways?<br>
<br>
Very curious to the answers to some of these questions,<br>
