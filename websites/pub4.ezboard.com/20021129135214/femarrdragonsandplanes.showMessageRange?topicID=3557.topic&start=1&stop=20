The enclosed information is true and as correct to it's original form as I can remember it.<br>
<br>
It started with a phone call.<br>
<br>
Picture the scenario. I'm sat at my desk happily minding my own business when a call gets transferred to me as the person responsible for the IT equipment here:<br>
<br>
<I>Caller : Hi there. It's  Adam here from IFOR Solutions. I wonder if I can have a minute of your time. ( Now already I know how this conversation is going to go, but once having been a salesman myself I'm intrigued )<br>
Kerryn : Sure, How can I help?<br>
Adam : I wonder if I could send some information to you about a new service we're offering. ( Bad idea. Never send a brochure out until your mark is hooked. These things cost money and most people will accept them to blow you off. Seeing the easy way out I take it. )<br>
Kerryn : Yeah. Mark it for my attention. The name is *name* ( edited for security )<br>
Adam : Ok are you still at *Address*<br>
Kerryn : Yes. We are.<br>
Adam : Can I ask do you have many computers there?<br>
Kerryn : We have about 10.<br>
Adam : I wonder if you'd be interested in some support for your machines.<br>
( Once again bad idea. It's a statement rather then a question. Your opening yourself to silence and confusion. But I'm a nice guy and I don't want the poor guy to feel awkward. )<br>
Kerryn : No. I do all that myself.<br>
Adam : Oh. Have you thought about hiring some outside support? ( Never imply or assume your client cannot do his job )<br>
Kerryn : No. I'm fully qualified to do all the support we need. There would be no point. ( He gets the idea )<br>
Adam : Do you have any hardware support?<br>
Kerryn : We purchased all our hardware from Dell.<br>
Adam : Ah are you interested in extending your warranty.<br>
Kerryn : We have 2 1/2 years remaining on our hardware support.<br>
Adam : ( getting the picture he is hopelessly in over his head ) Ok then, thank you for your time. </I><br>
</I><br>
<br>
So the pretext is set.<br>
<br>
Yesterday morning the information is received. As I expected its a 25 full colour glossy brochure and I'd already decided IFOR will never see my money when the conversation started. But the kicker? Also in the parcel is one, red & black juggling ball.<br>
<br>
Now I juggle and quite well actually but I'm a little perplexed. What the fu<I></I>ck am I supposed to do with one juggling ball? I pick up the brochure and I pull the phone number. ( Damn, thats why. They got me to phone them. I spend 3 minutes on hold before I realise I've been duped but nonetheless I'm ready for this one )<br>
<br>
<I><br>
Receptionist : Good Morning IFOR Solutions. Julie speaking, how may I be of service?<br>
Kerryn : Hello Julie. I was wondering how many arms you have. You have 2?<br>
Julie :........Er...yes.<br>
Kerryn : Thank you. Can I speak to Adam please?<br>
Julie : The number is ringing, I'm connecting you call now.<br>
Adam : Good Afternoon IFOR Solutions. Adam speaking. ( It's here I realise that Adam puts on a voice when making sales calls because now he's speaking with the dulcet tones of an ashmatic rhino smoking dope )<br>
Kerryn : Hello again Adam. It's <name> from <company name> We spoke yesterday about your companies services?<br>
Adam : ( Voice perked up again ) Yes, how can I help? Are you interested in our service?<br>
Kerryn : To be honest. No.<br>
Adam: ( rhino voice )<br>
Kerryn : I've received a ball.<br>
Adam : Yes sir. Thats our complimentary IFOR ball.<br>
Kerryn : What's it for?<br>
Adam : It's a juggling ball.<br>
Kerryn : Oh. Your receptionist Julie..she has two arms right?<br>
Adam : ( Warily ) Yes sir.<br>
Kerryn : And you also have two arms? ( I'm not going to assume he has two arms. As soon as I make that assumption he'll tell me he lost one in a car accident. My luck is that bad. )<br>
Adam : Yes I do.<br>
Kerryn : Do you juggle?<br>
Adam : Well I didn't but I've been trying lately.<br>
Kerryn : How many balls can you juggle?<br>
Adam : I'm ok with 3.<br>
Kerryn : I can only juggle one.<br>
Adam : Oh. Is there anything I can help you with?<br>
Kerryn : Yes. Send me another 2 juggling balls.<br>
Adam : What?<br>
Kerryn : How on earth am I supposed to juggle with only one ball. Care to explain that concept to me?<br>
Adam : Well you can't.<br>
Kerryn : I agree. I wonder if you could send me two more.<br>
Adam : I'll see what I can do.<br>
Kerryn : Thank you.<br>
Adam : No problem sir. ( I hang up ) </I><br>
<br>
This morning two more balls turn up so I have to start asking the question. Why the hell are some people so stupid. Why send a ball, for no reason, to someone who has no use for your companies services? Then, when it is stated clearly again , why did they send me 2 more?<br>
<br>
About this time I'm wondering how far I can take this. I'm on a mission. I want to see how many balls I can get. So without further ado I pick up the brochure again, find the e-mail address and begin to type.<br>
<br>

Dear Sirs,<br>
<br>
I have recently received a set of juggling balls from your company and although I am grateful a number of staff have asked where they might get some.<br>
<br>
I wonder if you would be grateful enough to send me some more.<br>
<br>
Kind regards<br>

We haven't got any more of the juggling balls up here at the moment. We're supposed to be getting some more cases on Tuesday so we can send them then.<br>

Adam, *Company name* have been on asking for some more juggling balls for other members of staff. What do you want me to do?<br>
<br>
<HR><br>
<br>
I ask for 3 sets.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I'll keep you posted but the aim is to get as many balls as possible. Just how stupid are some people?<br>
<br>
But the question is not really how many balls I can get. But how many balls can you get? <A HREF="mailto: enquiries@ifor.net">IFOR IT Solutions</A> <p><CENTER><A HREF="http://ak.lonelygamer.com">

<br>
  Either way its an advertising tool , that one ball got you to call them , e-mail them and post their name on a public msg board . All that cost them what amounts to maybe 10 cents. How many other people will ask you where you got the ball(s) and you will entertain them with the above story.<br>
  <br>
  The balls them selfs probably cost like 3 cents if that (in proper quanties) mailing them out to prospects ? negligalbe(sp) they are already mailing you a brochure.  its strange ploy Ill agree and if the ball isnt logo'd its a flawed ploy , sending out one ball is odd but it did get you to call back didnt it ? perhaps the next person that calls back wont have the expertise you have and might be swayed into accepting thier service.<br>
<br>
  At any rate , is it stupid ? I think it is and its not an idea I would pitch to one of my clients , is it effective ? well 5 mins ago I didnt know about this company ,now I know they do contract IT support (unless I read wrong) add that to the people that regularly read this board whom may or may not have ever heard of this company and may or may not be in need of contract IT. All that free word of mouth advertiseing from a little ball , effective? you decide.<br>
<br>
  There is no such thing as bad advertising.<br>

Update 16:43pm 27.8.02. That's 8.27.02 for you numbnuts that can't work it out.<br>

I have just taken delivery of 9 more juggling balls accompanied by this note as follows:<br>
<br>
<FONT COLOR="Orange"><br>
Apologies for our delay in picking up your email.<br>
<br>
I grant you that its difficult to juggle with one ball, and although I'm supposed to bring the other two in person and present our company at the same time, on this occasion I'm happy to waive you the burden of meeting us, and will therefore send you the sets you have requested in the post.<br>
<br>
Best regards,<br>

So now it becomes clear. Anyway. I still have 12 balls and as we've already established I can only juggle with 5 these days. Hmmn. <p><CENTER><A HREF="http://ak.lonelygamer.com">
