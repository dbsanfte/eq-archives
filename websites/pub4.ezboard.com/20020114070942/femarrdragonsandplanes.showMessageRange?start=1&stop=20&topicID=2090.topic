The next time someone says no to a platinum offer because they feel it is too low, I'm going to tell to them with 1 platinum increments until they spill their greedy guts and admit what they want.  I guarantee they wouldn't ever say 'whoah man, that's a bit more than I was looking for!&quot;<br>
<br>
The old excuse &quot;I wasn't sure what it was worth&quot; holds no water whatsoever, seeing as how there are several web pages out there with continuously updated pricings, not to mention plenty of people right there in EC who will be more than happy to answer your &quot;price check!&quot;<br>
<br>
It's all well and fine that there are people out there who get their jollies buying and selling, I just hate the total ripoff attitude most people seem to have in the process.  I don't mind people making a profit, but I seriously mind people trying to take advantage of me.<br>
<br>
Let this serve as a warning to the next person who replies to me with &quot;make an offer&quot; on a platinum based trade.  You can cram it up your rectum for that and all future business.  I won't hesitate to tell everyone I know you are a waste of time to deal with as well.<br>

Most people just have no idea what something is worth, and a pretty good way to gauge interest is to ask people to make you an offer. If someone doesnt want to sell you something for the price you offer, tough luck, there is no need to come crying to the message boards. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon2.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ukerryndarkwater.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kerryn Darkwater</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 346<br> <font color=#E9D756>(6/28/01 6:44:28 am)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Greedy Fucks</span><hr size=1> I used to stand quite firmly against this but then I realized that this wasn't the the only way to judge a persons greed. Nor is it a true one.<br>
<br>
I had a few items to sell this weekend. One was a Velium Ruby Veil, the others were Bracers of Ro. The Velium Ruby Veil was simple. I know what Velium is worth. I know what a Ruby is worth and I know how difficult they are to make. <br>
<br>
But the Bracers of Ro? I didn't even know what these things were worth when I got them 20 levels ago. How in the hell am I going to now 12 months on? I've lost track of whats happened in EC with the prices since I stopped trading at level 30. Now I just run in when I need to buy something and run out when Im done. <br>
<br>
Quite simply I opened it for offers. First one came back as 167 pp for one bracer. Now I know that it takes a minimum of 100pp to buy each bar of platinum so the cost has to be higher then 200. But what about the effort that was put into it? Thy went eventually for 400pp each. I don't care what they worth. I was happy to sell them for that price and the guy I sold them to was happy to offer it.<br>
<br>
The economy in Norrath works different then the way it does on earth. You can buy a 7/31 Fine Steel Longsword for 5pp. But it'll cost you 700pp for a 7/32 Longsword of the Rare Mob. So stats aren't even remotely workable.<br>
<br>
Web sites with prices. No use either I'm afraid. Some guy goes into EC one day sees an item he wants and sells his Longsword of the Rare Mob for 200pp for a quick sale. If he enters this on to a web site he can devalue the item based on the amount of people who have posted before. If only one guy has posted the true price of 700pp he's effectively brought the price down from 700pp to 450pp and thats a big change.<br>
<br>
Conversely this works for a seller. All he has to do prior to selling an item is to head for all the price sites and ,under a false name, claim that he has bought the item for double its value. A few times of this and he can effectively bring the price up WAY above its true value. Its then very easy for him to sell it 3 days later when he says well on EQPrices a Longsword of the Rare Mob sells for 1500pp. I'll let you have this for 1000pp. Hes ripped someone off for 300pp and come out smelling of roses. <br>
<br>
Add to the fact that on many sites the price is worked out on an average across all servers its totally wrong. There could be one enchanter on Rathe capable of making Velium Ruby Veils. He can effectively charge 4 times its value and if he sells enough he can bump the value to whatever price he sets.<br>
<br>
Conclusion : Never ever trust a price site, especially if a person says &quot;go look on....&quot;<br>
<br>
So what can a person do to obtain a true item on a price. Well he can do a PC on...<br>
I'm sorry but I get quite sick of listening to people go through this conversation.<br>
<br>
Dood1 &quot;How much did you pay for the Longsword of the Rare Mob?&quot;<br>
Dood2 &quot;1000pp&quot;<br>
Dood1 &quot;Man you got ripped&quot;<br>
Dood2 &quot;Huh?&quot;<br>
Dood1 &quot;They're only worth 700pp&quot;<br>
Dood2 &quot;I did a price check, only guy that answered said 1000-1200pp so I thought I did O.K.&quot;<br>
<br>
You idiot. The seller did this.<br>
<br>
Seller1 tells Bestmate_01 &quot;Hey dude...can you do me a favour and shout 1000-1200pp please?&quot;<br>
Bestmate_01 tells Seller1 &quot;Sure dude...heh.&quot;<br>
<br>
Either that or you just got real unlucky. Either way I wont trust PCs whilst the trade is in motion.<br>
<br>
I used to buy low and sell higher when I was young at the game. Not much. Id make 200pp profit on a 1000pp item when I needed a little cash. I'd keep an eye out for prices and if I saw a Longsword of the Rare Mob going for 500pp for a quick sale Id grab it. Id then sell it for the 700pp it was worth. So if you ask me for a price check on a longsword of the rare mob im going to say this.<br>
<br>
500pp if you're buying 700pp if you're selling. Hey at least its accurate.<br>
<br>
Conclusion : Price checks are unreliable especially if a trade is in motion.<br>
<br>
So you have 1 choice left. You can sit round EC watching for this item to sell and asking how much its going for. You do this for a few days and if its not a very rare item you're quite likely to get a price. But your screwed if the item is rare that anyone rarely sees it. You're also screwed if you dont have that time to sit in EC.<br>
<br>
So until then you're always going to get &quot;Make an offer....&quot; <br>
<br>
I don't like it either. Some people use this for greed to further their own ends at the expense of others. It's unfortunately an open license to rip people off. But unless you show me a better way, proven to work...it's a way of life.<br>

If you say &quot;taking offers&quot;, then refuse an offer, it's clear that you have a good idea of what it's worth.  This is only in reference to me, as I do not make ripoff offers.<br>
<br>
Here is an example of the conversation that I hate:<br>
Assume in this example the going rate for the item is 10k<br>
<br>
Sleazy auctions 'wts item x, plat only, taking offers'<br>
You tell Sleazy '9k'<br>
Sleazy tells you 'hmm no I want more'<br>
You tell Sleazy '10k then'<br>
Sleazy tells you 'hmm no that's not quite what I was looking for'<br>
<br>
At this point I *know* this prick knows exactly what he wants for the item.  What the hell is he doing besides fucking around trying to gauge how much he can sock it to me for more than the going rate?  Yeah I might have made a low initial offer, but it was at least a fair offer.<br>
It's like dealing with a used car salesman trying to see how far he can insert the hook.<br>
<br>
I guess I should have been more specific about the type of skullduggery that annoys me.<br>
<br>
Oh and Virral you can shove it up your ass for whatever it's worth...make an offer.<br>

<br>
Anyway, as for the rest, its pretty simple. Don't deal with them. If they are looking for what is (and it might surprise you that this would be your opinion, rather than ordained by God) a high price, then don't buy from them.<br>
<br>
People often do not know what things are worth, and ask for offers. They know what the item is, and they probably have a vauge idea what something of that caliber is worth, so they would have an incredibly rough ballpark in thier head. Maybe &quot;Sleazy&quot; thought somewhere closer to 15k was fair for the item, but wanted to hear what people were willing to pay. He is probably wrong, but thats what happens when you have no real idea. So he is kinda thinking 15k, you say 9k and he thinks &quot;aww fuck this guy, he is trying to screw me&quot;<br>
<br>
MAY GOD STRIKE HIM DOWN FOR NOT KNOWING ITS 10K!<br>
<br>
Seriously Jengo, I can appreciate your sick of people not selling to you at whatever price you deem appropriate (don't they know who you ARE?), but this is possibly the most pathetic little whinge Ive seen in awhile.<br>

<br>
I sometimes use the 'Make me an offer' in trades and I do so because I am NOT a greedy prick. I may have a rough idea of what some people think items were worth once from asking about and from various sites but I have never been in to getting lots of money (just ask anyone who knows me. my all-time high is 6kpp in the bank) so when I do try to sell something I am pretty flexible in what I am willing to take for it.<br>
<br>
If I have heard an item is worth about 15k and someone offers me 5k I am naturally gonna tell the other person got get real. If they offer me 12k then I will probably say yes cos I know we will both be happy (I got money for being in the right place at the right time and they got an item pretty cheap).<br>
<br>
To be honest, Mr Bodie, you sound like one of the gimps who offers 5k and you seem to be whining because some people have a clue while you are being a greedy bastage trying to make a fast pp by buying low and selling high. <p><b>Brumfondl Majicthise</b><BR>

Did you all even bother to read the rest of the thread before you jumped in with a bunch of responses that other people covered quite thoroughly?<br>

Maybe then you would have seen my reply to said situations.<br>

Also, Meg, please try a period or something once in a while.  That conciousness stream style writing is a real pain to read.<br>

You managed to group up about 90% of all people on the server, and call them fucks.<br>
<br>
You are bitching about people who don't know what to ask for something and don't really want to get ripped off. Is that greed?<br>
<br>
If I have an item for sale, and do not know what to ask, I do not set a price... why? Not because I want to screw someone for all they are worth, but because I do not want to set a price far lower than the normal value and get screwed myself. And yet, I am capable of guessing what the item is roughly worth, so please excuse me if the offers might seem abit low.<br>
<br>
And anyway, lets assume your mate Sleazy DOES know the item is worth 10k, and wants abit more... how is he different to you wanting to buy it for abit less? The moment you come clean and offer what its worth, is he supposed to fall to his knees and kiss your feet for being such a fantastic guy?<br>
<br>
Oh I forgot, we are complaining about the greedy people asking for offers in the hopes of getting more, rather than the greedy people giving low offers, in the hopes of spending less.<br>
<br>
Maybe you should make a page where you can set out exactly what you believe each item is worth, so people no longer have an excuse to rely on thier own judgement?<br>

It's all true, in fact I couldn't have said it better.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;You are bitching about people who don't know what to ask for something and don't really want to get ripped off. Is that greed?&quot;<br>
<br>
No, I am not really bitching about that.  Apparently I am just too impatient to put up with the little games people play with each other in EC though.  <br>
<br>

<br>
I really don't mind that someone is trying to make a decent profit.  In fact I pretty much always pay above market price for whatever, and sell below it as well.  At least when I can stand to be in EC long enough to buy or sell something.  What I do resent is someone playing games and dicking around with my time when there is no reason for it. <br>
<br>
If you have a price, say so already.  That is all I'm saying, and in fact it's *ALL I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO SAY*  How can you disagree with this?  I guess you can if you are just a greedy whore, which, apparently, you are.  I guess I'm just a communist.<br>

I have a price in mind and will let you know but to gauge how serious a bid is make an offer is a good start.<br>
<br>
Case in point, I have been auctioning A MoSS and SS boots. I paid 4k for the mace and won the boots on random. If I am forced to give a price I would like the 4k I spent on the mace back. I do however know this is unreasonable. I like to haggle and in the EQ Market it is the only way to get a fair price. I have much better things to do then scan webpages for prices and sit in commons for hours on end. <br>
<br>
Make an offer means &quot;Hey, I am open to your response lets talk about it and can usually get you a deal once I state a price I won't move from it. Had a couple tells last night on the MoSS asking the price when asked for a price 2k is what I said. At that point I can not haggle, I can't take a trade and this person just closed the possibility that I am bored as hell want to get rid of it and move on. When ever I get there I will sell cheaper then the market but if there is no haggle then there can be no deal. &quot;Let's Make a Deal&quot; the art is not dead.<br>
