I of course petition but what good does that do...  50+ hotspur pwrlvling floria have a right to pull too...  I suppose he &quot;talked&quot; to hotspur who said he would &quot;share&quot; ..  and he did share he gave us one every now and then... I didn't stick around much longer.

How many other places are there to PL instead of taking over a camp.  There was a similar thread in reverse about this and many said, don't level in a zone that is commonly used to PL'ing.  Well, that is good advice when you are looking for camps and they are all taken by PL'ers.  But to have one come up and take your camp?  What a crock of shit!  They could live by the same rule...how many other camps in how many other zones on how many other continents could they have PL'd?<br>

Sure, sure...ppl are going to whine about &quot;No such thing as a camp&quot;, and &quot;sharing&quot;. But when you are high enough to Pl someone you can go any freakin where for someone of derv level. There used to be such a thing as &quot;common curtesy&quot;...I think. Maybe not in EQ =/<br>

  Thank you for your support.  If we all take matters into our own hands and contact eq with our thoughts on problems like this we might get something done.<br>
  I have written them .. This is a completely new territory and we are all learning what needs to be done and what rules need to be made and reinforced. Who better to make the rules than the players themselves.<br>

As usual the undesirable among us, like this cleric, say whatever pops into their head to hurt others or put themselves forward with no regard for truth or fair play-- if ONLY like she promises in her original post to this thread, she were ACTUALLY leaving EQ-- how much better for us...<br>
<br>
Also-- even to the first glance there is a great deal of contradictory information to do with this -- you would think if she were going to spend so much effort spinning a tale she would at least make it logical and consistent, wouldn't you?<br>

Um...I saw the whole thing as well and laralyn's(Geneiveve's) group had the camp for quite some time before the PLers showed up.  <br>
<br>
"Also-- even to the first glance there is a great deal of contradictory information to do with this -- you would think if she were going to spend so much effort spinning a tale she would at least make it logical and consistent, wouldn't you<br>
"<br>
<br>
WTF?<br>
<br>
Um...Sir Rapacious Dimwit of 1 grand post...you call her post inconsistent yet don't even support your own with an example of said inconsistency?  That's logical, eh?  It looked pretty straightforward from reading it and witnessing it firsthand.../shrug<br>
<br>
"The long and short of it is that she was encouraging the party members to ks from some poor soloing bard and then got upset when A) a higher level stepped in preventing them from walking all over the solo person"<br>
<br>
This high lvl who just happened to be in the same guild, Gorean, as the bard.  Brilliant.  I already told you, Laralyn's group had the camp first.  Therefore this bard, soloer or being PLed, is shit out of luck regardless.  <br>
<br>
Whichever you *actually* are Mr. Rapacious, the PLer or PL'd or both, I would be a little more careful next time you try to steal an xp camp, last thing you want is some pissed off lvl 51 necro dropping HGs and griffin's in the lap of your poor little twink.(yes that was a threat)<br>
<br>
And next time you'd like to add insult to injury by calling my wife a crackpot on these boards, you better be prepared for a verbal thrashing that WILL be painful...but not nearly so painful as the disgustingly arrogant substitute for grammar that you spewed in this line of your post:<br>

The  ksing was on her and her groups part, floria was ksed several times and almost killed when the group overpulled and ran away, leaving her in the killing path of a mob of angry dervs.  Guess they miscalculated what they could handle while ksing from her.  <br>
<br>
To add to this slander, the person who wrote the original grievance is NOT GONE as promised, I have seen them on the game.  I am disgustedly fed up with people like this on our game that can't stop at ksing and bad behavior but seem to invest a majority of their time in lies, character slurs and just plain making things up things.  <br>

Calling people who read these threads names wont win you  any friends if your insulting thier intelligence like that.<br>
<br>
but oh well, Just one question...who was at the derv camp first? the grp or the PL'er? I dont see anyone stating who was there first other than the first poster. So is no one contesting?<br>
<br>
If the &quot;gaining experience the old fashoned way&quot; group was there first..then Gorean/Hotspur/Rapacious and Floria are asses who dont understand common courtesy.<br>
<br>
If the PL'n peoples were their first...for crying out loud..there are MUCH better places to PL someone than a WC derv camp.<br>
But touche`, if they were there first then the right was theirs.<br>

I was soloing at the derv   And yes, if someone else comes along and wants to share the camp you are required to. So I was pulling small and got trained and stolen from by the group was there, they almost got me killed several times.  So I asked in guild if anyone was nearby and Hotspur answered he would come &amp; help me.  He stayed to make sure I was ok and we decided to powerlevel me since he was there.  We were killing dervs, bears, spiders and anything that came my way.  And tried to share the camp with the group but they were unwilling and kept taking the kills I was working on.  <br>
<br>
I was not trying to ks anyone, only to get some experience too.  and to see this come up on my name and my guild makes me very upset at the person who would write this in the first place.  : (  <br>
