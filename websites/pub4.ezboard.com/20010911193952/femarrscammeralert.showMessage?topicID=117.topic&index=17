Beside, I never started this, let it slide.<br>
<br>
Lets get the facts clear, I am THE victim, not the other way around. <br>
<br>
Hmm I will try to make a more comprehensible post, sorry if I failed. Only read if you are interested, this is a warning. English is NOT my mother's tounge. =p<br>
<br>
1. For anyone that had ever deal with Verant, they will know how slow they usually works. Yet, how long does it took to suspend your account? I believe it took 1 day ONLY, that will be clue enough, log NEVER lies.<br>
Naguk petition and report with the winning roll and the many beggings from us asking for ya to give it back, hence the evidence got ya suspended. Some people will accept that as FINAL closing, hard truth.<br>
<br>
2. Have ya ever group before? When someone went LD, their name will be gone from the group list INSTANTLY! As a cleric, believe me that my attention is always fully FIXED on that part of the screen. Hence, that  makes Naguk so mad with you, as we saw your name still in group, yet you are not responding to our group say, begging ya. Beside, we sat in front of ya, checking if ya had the LD tag and keep begging ya till your char suddenly dissapear, hence the conclusion that it is a camp and not LD.<br>
<br>
3. Cyrrain was NOT in our group, he was there waiting as the next in list, hence he is a neutral party and can be more reliaby trusted than group member, which Naguk and Foxxer were and ya saying them not group members, as in this phrase &quot;Although 2 of them werent in it i guess they just decided to asy that. Naguk and foxxer being the 2.&quot; Ryched was a group member, but he choose to side with you, as he is a good FRIEND of ya, and thats where the information of you needing the FBSS for either your warrior Ziggenz or passing it guild leader to make him happy come from. But I think even Ryched wavers from the hard evidence shown. You must have short memory span or your name give us a clue, as you seems to talk about another event at another server, apparently.<br>
<br>
<br>
Nerric/Brannod, I am sorry ... I am sure Naguk, Cyrrain will side with me on this, as when we sat there looking at Crackie, there was NO other players beside the 3 of us. You must be either invis, or please provide the names of this &quot;A couple of us&quot; that was there too. And ... we were watching Crackie dissapear and the instant THAT happens I ask in ooc if I am truly shafted at that time, INSTANTLY, Caeill knows that. I am sorry, but I dont think my typing is THAT bad that it took me 5-10 mins to type an ooc, I think it was 1 or 2 lines of text ONLY.<br>
<br>
I am not saying that you are one of Crackie friends, but the truth is many strangers had been giving me tell, offering so-called consolations and compensation and strangely, a few tell later, they are revealed to be his friends, as I was just lead into a trap, like coming to a spot, with a train coming! I can tell you, that the ability of cleric to divine and gate, has saves my life many times on this, I am just this gullible, those who knows me must understand. And yes, I rez ppl when I can, yet they have used this trick to try to kill me too, so I am asking ppl to drag corpse to me now, yet the train still come, help me. I will NEVER be anno!<br>
<br>
Want a clue that your statement is in doubt? Everyone who has ever been in group will realise that MOST if not ALL the converstation will be in group say, and the congrats will be definetely on group say, there is NO other reason to say congrats in public, aye? People will be laughing at this hard prove, see? Dont treat me as enemy, not a personal attack, just my side of story, forget about this, thanks.<br>
<br>
And Crackie, I am still saying this, dont be so stupid! Lots of your friends/guildies has ask me about the case, and yet I told them that it was a misunderstanding, I am the one who is wrong, I apologise for making a ruckus out of it (I didnt in fact make a ruckus, ya did, as once I asked those questions in ooc, I camp, telling them to let it slide and forget about it, time heals everything, I am sure ppl who were present at lguk can confirm this). <br>
<br>
I am just trying to be nice, I want to give the impression to your friends that it was an honest mistake. Do you understand that I am saving face for you? Cause I feel bad that you got suspended, I know how it feels to addicts like us! I rather makes a person feeling bad owning me a favour than makes a person MAD thinking of me owning him a favour, see? You started it, now let it slide or you will be the one who suffer more in the long run. I am NOT your enemy, I DONT want to be, as in the 8 months time since I join, I got NO enemy, NOT even one, I am SURE of this. Get the point?<br>
<br>
People know this fact - when its a long camp, everyone will be tired and sometimes, the thought of ... I will be able to escape punishment with this 1st mistake ... will cross the mind. I am sure a lot of people will tell you when it comes to an item like FBSS, people WILL be tempted! If you dont forget about it, others wont, and who suffers in the end? You can provide logs/emails, yet people have already make up their mind, the evidence is just that hard to be cast aside.<br>
<br>
I hereby apologies to ya, I REALLY love chanters, all cleric DO.<br>
<br>
/em stares at %t in the face<br>
/em gives him a nod to catch his attention<br>
/em bows sincerely to make a statement<br>
/em tries to hug %t to erase the pain<br>
/em walks hand in hand with %t to watch the sunset<br>
<br>
PS the one at LOIO is amazing, anyone know other lovely spot?<br>
<br>
Hiya Parum, your guild is honorable aye? Blaizzen and Azzlano is my personal friens, that will give a clue. <br>
Oh yeah, I need the FBSS for my monk but I am willing to trade jboot for it, yes, I MIGHT get tricked in the AC ring hand-in process. Tboot will cost me hmm like 8k, cause of factions and charisma, so I will stick with jboot, I CANT win against those many KSer fighting for the AC. In fact Blaizzen tried to get jboot for 3 nights now, losing the OOT camp countless times to KSer and the sro camp to druids that can track, she might had given up now. A knights of virtue friend also brag that he can get in between 2-8 hours, yet he is too ashamed to even bring the topic up now. Aye, I had contacted Cynil/Muzyn, but his asking price is 10k, is he trustworthy? Thanks! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ucaeill.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Caeill</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 38<br> <font color=#E9D756>(5/14/01 3:04:59 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Crackie not a scammer, just an honest mistake. =p</span><hr size=1> Well to defend myself on Crakie's alligations on stealing sage. Called camp check, sage open woohoo. Moved in, no one there, established camp. Someone came in there and said sage is camped, I don't see anyone around, camped now. Then the whole party moves from exe to sage and said it's camped. Now I know exe/sav/cav/sage is usually a camp but come on, that's just greedy. Anyways I argued the point because I was tired but instead yielded and let them have camp but I stayed until they were finished. And...if you ask anyone that was there they can say that I saved their parties asses once or twice on a monks bad pull. I was told the monk was insane too /shrug. If I wasn't there they certaintly would have died. Pet took out one by himself and I killed like 2 others out of a 7 or 8 froggy pull. Anyways sounds to me like Crakie is pointing fingers trying to get the attention on someone else, like the SK WHO STOLE SAGE! Riiiiight.  <p>Caeill K`Vor<BR>

Caeill the group told you you could have another camp that they wanted sage and you ignored them and stayed in room anyway.  Would it not have been the right thing to do to give the people who had been there all night the choice of the camp they wanted to give up?    <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uravern1.showPublicProfile?language=EN>ravern 1</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 7<br> <font color=#E9D756>(5/15/01 5:48:45 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: bah</span><hr size=1> dress wearing classes shouldnt even be rolling for that item need b4 gred snd sll that <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uincubosem.showPublicProfile?language=EN>IncubosEM</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 78<br> <font color=#E9D756>(5/15/01 9:30:17 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: bah</span><hr size=1> How do you know that the tanks in the group didnt already have a fbss ravern?

Remember, it happenned at lguk on Emarr, not another server, yes its true. =p<br>
<br>
Ryched, if you are reading this, and if your are saying that Naguk and Foxxer were NOT in that group, then I will know what kind of person you are.<br>
<br>
Aaah so someone is a friend of Infernal, then you will know what kind of a guild Moment of Clarity is. So ask that former guild leader if its true that he still cannot believe how trustworthy I am? Remind him on who passed his FBSS to the barb rogue at OT. =p<br>
<br>
I have a lot in my mind, things that are too ugly to say, and Hipp, those words will destroy your guild reputation fast, as they are ugly indeed, on how I had been so badly treated by your guild caused of this episode.<br>
<br>
I still repeat this, I am THE victim!<br>
<br>
Giving you an example on how bad it is - A burglar broke into my home, I manage to overpower him, hand him to the police, he was jailed for a week. All those time, he manage to contact his friends, and they come in hordes to harrass me and tried to make my life unbearable. In a week time, that burglar will be free and in his mind, there is only one thing, revenge! <br>
<br>
See the problem here? I never wanted this hostility, I never want that burglar as my enemy, its him who forced his way into my life, that used to be a bliss. Well, he got punished caused of me, but if he never done anything wrong, why would he? Oh yeah, I am to be blame, cause I have that big house that is just too inviting to be broke into. Get the point? We can NEVER win.<br>
<br>
I think I should be in hiding mode for an indefinite time, so that the burglar cant find my family and will switch to another target and maybe forget about me. =p <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/bemarr.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=crakiepipe>crakiepipe</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 6<br> <font color=#E9D756>(5/15/01 12:54:04 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> bah</span><hr size=1> Waawi, Naguk and Foxxer were not in group.

Those who are interested can just give him a tell, since he is a neutral party, not siding with both, only reporting what he has seen. Thats what police and lawyer will choose to believe on.<br>
<br>
As for Ryched, he went LD, so how can he know about roll and you? That whats makes me become suspicious of his integrity, he log in back after he went LD, he never accept our explanation, not even hard truth that has been shown to him, thats why we think he is a friend. Be good to him, he has done ya service, although in a blind way.<br>

&quot;Waawi, Naguk and Foxxer were not in group. They left right after roll on FBSS. 10 minutes later i go ld.&quot; This statement makes us think that either your EQ is bugged or your name gives us clue. It happens, thats why its called bugs. =p<br>
