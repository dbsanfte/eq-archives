I'm not going to call names, ask for anything, or try to shade anything in my guild's favor. This is it.<br>
<br>
Last night, Monday October 29th, was one of the more headache inducing nights I have ever had in Everquest. Before I get to that, however, I need to give some background information. For the last month or so I have been trying to get Divine Grace to work out a system where my guild, United Independent, would be allowed to get a Dozekar or two in ToV.  That is not the issue here, but lets just say my attempts went without any results, and I was told last spawn that we could have all the Dozekars we want once Divine Grace moves on to N ToV and switches faction. Since we're switching in probably less than a month, that was completely unacceptable. Why, you ask, does United Independent need to work out a deal with Divine Grace to get a shot at Dozekar? Simply put, Dozekar spawns about 4 hours before his time of death last spawn. Divine Grace kills him at 9-11 AM EST on Patch day, and then until the next patch he'll spawn at 5 AM or so every spawn. By doing this, Divine Grace is able to lock him down until the next patch, making it practically impossible for any other guild to get a shot at him, due to it being at near their peak time and at a time most North Americans are asleep or on their way to work. Since Divine Grace has a large group of non-Americans in their ranks, this works out wonderfully for them, basically allowing them to keep him to themselves until the next patch day. Since an agreement could not be made, my guild decided we'd do what we could to get a Doze or two before we switch, but if we couldn't.... fuck it. On to last night.<br>
<br>
Last night my guild split our priorities into two areas: Sleeper's Tomb for those of us with keys, and Temple of Veeshan to farm armor and watch for doze just in case he spawned way early. At around midnight Dozekar spawned, quite a few hours early, and those of us in ST made our way to ToV. It being a weeknight and lots of people having to work the next day, we were confident about making him die, but we knew we had to do it in 1 or 2 tries with a basic skeleton force. At this point 9-11 DG had slowly trickled into ToV and were sitting at the zonein/hub basically doing nothing. At approximately 1AM EST we pulled Dozekar, landed our debuffs, and commenced the smackdown. When he was at approximately 40% and the fight going rather well the shit started. A Divine Grace ranger by the name of Gailen walked up to the door to Halls of Testing, and opened it. As any guild who has spent any time in Halls of Testing knows, when you do this Zemm, a named drake, and 2 CoV faction drakes agro anyone inside Halls of Testing if they are in the process of fighting anything, even if you are not KoS to clawsofveeshan. They proceeded to add, wipe us out, and end what I feel would have been a successful Dozekar fight. We commenced rezzing up, our people suitably pissed off and determined to kill him so Divine Grace would not be able to after their actions. Golgar, an officer who was there the whole time of Divine Grace, /ooc'd at us to shut up about it that he did not control the actions of his guildmembers. About that time, while we're rezzing up, 3 North ToV Wyverns come through the door and wipe us out again. The thing about North ToV mobs is that they corpse camp. Being all naked, this basically forced us to spend the rest of our active night corpse recovering, effectively making the chance of us killing Dozekar nil. <br>
<br>
To summarize, multiple members of Divine Grace working right in front of an officer in their guild trained us not once but twice in an effort to make sure Dozekar would be there for them to kill in the morning when their army logs on. That is exactly what happened.<br>
<br>
Due to their time advantage they will probably continue to be able to hoard this spawn to their heart's content, and since no guides or GMs were on at the time, the chance of any reallistic retribution from customer service is basically gone.  Divine Grace still plans to kill Dozekar and kill the named drakes that we would have killed had they not trained us twice. Every indication also points to them continuing this hoarding of the spawn and irreverence toward others unless some unforeseen solution makes itself apparent. I am speaking for my guild in this, and we are not asking for any help, or pity. We simply want the rest of the server who may not know it to know the type of actions this guild is capable of, and how it is seemingly supported by their leadership corps. Maybe they'll get their just desserts eventually, but I won't hold my breath. Wish you the best.<br>
<br>
Gilg<br>
<br>
PS: Expect the response from Divine Grace on this to be that we(meaning every person in North America not in their guild) hoard all the other spawns, making what they do completely fair. This obviously will justify their repeated training in their eyes. The fact of the matter is all the big guilds work with each other. When you plan something, you talk to the other guilds so you don't butt heads. This system has worked great and we've avoided conflicts with every other guild on the server except for Divine Grace. They refuse to work with anyone, knowing their time advantage will allow them to pick one mob every patch day to keep as theirs until the next time a patch comes around. That patch is usually also done during their peak period, allowing them to pick another mob to keep during the next cycle. By refusing to even try to work with us they have lost all respect and/or pity I may have had for their supposed dire situation. Interested to see what you folks have to say, later.....<br>

We got a later screenshot of them telling us how they brought the N.ToV mobs over, I'll have to figure out which member took it.  Oh, but wait...thats right I remember.  Those came "by accident when I came to see how our ranger died".   Riiiiggghhhttt.<br>

Tonight was some of the most inconsiderate shit I have seen. You know its funny after all this I even rezzed the gai guy and another one of their members. We have always shown them consideration etc when they insist on pharming doze. We do not sit in tov for hours and train them . Although now i wish we had we say Ok DG in Tov ( again ) and bail . <br>
Finished CR at 4 am est tonight , after ressing and dragging numerous corpses would like to salute Divine Grace with a big &quot; Fuck you &quot;... I will never go out of my way to show u anything but a lack of respect . That was so fookin sad VERY! Funny thing is u know why is it when I have asked them questions in the past I got no replies, but tonight man they all spoke engrish very well /shrug!! Was even told fuckey roo Yaraa  * gasp*...<br>

Funny thing is, those screen shots don't show anything i said in my guild.. and all this is turning out to be a one sided battle.  I have nothing to defend, and i have nothing to hide.  Saying thing, is diffirent from actually doing it.  Anyhow, i have faith that the people that actually know me.  Will see that this is all a big frame to get rid of me, and to ruin my reputation.  As goes for the people in UI.. you can hate me all you want, and you can think whatca want.  But you are flaming me and ruining my rep over a silly mob.  And like i said to Gilg when i talked to him for an hour..  If they get Doze, best of luck.   As goes for the people writing and taking screen shots.   You must really have alot of time on your hands to try and get rid of someone from a game.<br>

All I know is what I just read.<br>
<br>
     And I have to say..that BUBU, or even Gilg (no clue if you are the same person now, and furthermore dont give a shit)  accusing someone of training them and trying to ruin them having a chance at a mob is so funny that I almost ended up in the hospital from laughing my ass off.<br>
<br>
      I assure you that WHATEVER happened was either accidental, or the actions of individuals.  It certainly wasn't an &quot;evil Guild plan&quot;  or if it was I certainly wasn't notified that it was part of our new Screw UI over contigency plans.  Of course I could be wrong because I know we have nothing better to do than follow UI members around in the middle of the night and try to get them wiped out.<br>
<br>
     At any rate, after all the lameass, shitty things you have done to people, I seriously doubt that this raises much of a fuss  in the community, and if it does, well I guess that it shows that people like to flame more than play.<br>
<br>
 Oh yeah...sorry you had a bad night, it sucks to get wiped in there cause some curious soul opened the door at the wrong time.  It has happened to all of us, so deal with it.<br>

I can see on a screenshot that enaak says Train 2 ntov mobs on them ,but when Golgar says this, you guys are angry?..<br>
I remember when we pulled dozekar a couple of weeks ago and Gilgamel entered as well...we didn't had the agro from zemm , so I take it he entered a few seconds before the agro would have gone over...but gilg kept spamming us with message about how we hog doze etc etc.<br>
I personnaly think we should try to solve this problem and are more then willing to work an idea out but im just alone and really can't do such a thing alone , when there are over 100 people wanting a solution (counted the 2 guilds togheter)<br>
Again, I will talk to some officers of DG , and see what comes up.<br>
Personnaly gilg, I have insulted you there, and badly, and I felt sorry for it too, since many of UI are considered friends.<br>
I don't think golgar would call a member to train mobs on you, that is just not grdy, Personaly I think gailen went looking and wasn't aware of what happened.<br>
I can currently not log on into EQ and talk to them till friday, but promise you all I will.<br>
as for the events that happened, I apologise to all of you, into the name of DG.<br>
Lets give it time so far till at least this weekend , so I can talk with gailen and the others.<br>
I would apreciate it if you give me the time to work it out.<br>
Thanks and again , Sorry<br>

<br>
reading some of the dg responses so far i find it quite humorous that they're ignoring the screenshots where it clearly shows blazestorm (i'm disappointed in you mr.) and golgar stating to train 2 Ntov mobs on UI.  who cares if the door opening aggroed or whatever, the screenshots prove that your actions (at least on the second account) were intentional.  and i promise everyone the first screenshot stating these facts are not fabricated.  there wasn't enough time for someone to whip this up on the computer between the time from which this happened and the time in which it was posted. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ugurglespitfruggybasher.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gurglespit Fruggybasher</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://dyce.i8.com/gurblip.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 1236<br> <font color=#E9D756>(10/30/01 3:16:52 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The facts as they are.</span><hr size=1> I fail to see where in the screenshot Enaak says to train anyone scop.. perhaps you should look again and maybe point it out to me... <p><img src=http://dyce.i8.com/gurglespit2.gif></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/umoongaden.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Moongaden</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/image/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 96<br> <font color=#E9D756>(10/30/01 3:17:25 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A few recruiting slogan suggestions for DG</span><hr size=1> I think an important note is that there was about 10 seconds between the time enaak called ATTACK ( in out of character,  mind you, having set it that way in ST ) that the door was opened.<br>

Nobody here cares about your reputation or about ruining it. or should i say nobody DID care. I really dont know what to say, except the screenshots do say what happened, and if something on them is unaccurate, then please expain what. I do actually agree with your guildmates, this doesnt sound liek you... but i was there, and i saw and heard everything.<br>
<br>
What really concers me is the fact that Ntov mobs were chosen for this type of malicious &quot;revenge?&quot; or whatever you were trying to do. We had many people up late for this, people that work early. These people have the satisfaction of knowing that they are now going to have a horrible day tomorrow on 2 hours of sleep because you decided that ntov mobs would be great for fuckaging us. I believe our CR ended around 4:30a.m. and a Gm had to come from CHAT to /kill the ntov mobs.<br>
<br>
UI has had some hard times in the past, but personally i think we are doing good to keep clean and not fuck others over. i can assure you we were not aware in the past of what was thought of us and for what reasons. Up until Yenoms post, we had no idea. Ever since his post, Gilg and officers have worked their ass off to share the different spawns on this server with MF, Magister, and yes, even DG. <br>
<br>
Thank you Magister and MF for working with us, and making an overcrowded server somewhat managable<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  DG, sorry you dont share this kind of view with us <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Khorns pics were not made after the fact to fuck you over. During the buffing for doze, he was waiting at the entrance because yours truley had to call him in still... he is kos. When he said DG members were talking about this, none of us really paid notice to it, we didnt think it would really happen.<br>
<br>
This is/was not an attempt to fuck you over, and gunk your reputation... its just what happened. Why would we set this all up and try and hurt you when we could kill a dragon and get him on a managable spawn time for another week? honestly i forgot you even existed until now, i had no clue that golgar and grdy were the same person. Mabey it would have been a bit better if you thought about this a bit more before you did it <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
