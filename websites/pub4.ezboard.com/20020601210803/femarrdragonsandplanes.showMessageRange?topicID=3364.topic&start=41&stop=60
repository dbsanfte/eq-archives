Wannabee of what? <br>
<br>
I've been on this server since its inception. I was well aware of the drama and your accusations. I'm not someone new to this scene. <br>
<br>
I merely commented because I feel like I can point out issues because I do know what was going on and you've attacked people I've known for a long time. <br>
<br>
I've no problem engaging in a philosophical debate nor a semantical or mathematical one for that matter. <br>
<br>
I'm a wannabee because I actually I'm one of the few people who have known Vendrix, Koryo, Shinjo and all the other people you've alledged have wantoningly exploited, hacked, cheatered or whatever else you want to accuse them of. I'm a wannbee because I question your motive for clearingly making and ad hominum attacks completely divergent from the topic at hand.  Ok <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rolleyes --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/eyes.gif ALT=":rolleyes"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  .... whatever.<br>

There is a game that people play on the board. Right now it is 'challenge Chiteng' at times its 'challenge Mitch'<br>
sometimes 'challenge Dwarkarn or Raedwulf'.<br>
<br>
The purpose of the game is to score 'kudos' at the expense of the 'challenged'<br>
party. The purpose this serves is beyond me, BUT:<br>
<br>
Player 'A'  has an elaborate scheme to try and set a verbal trap. They do this on a regular basis. Usually it is so they can call someone a liar or a hypocrite.<br>
You can see Raedwulf doing it in the other thread. No one actually cares btw<br>
its just 'kudos'<br>
<br>
In this particular case, they had not been paying attention to 'ALL' posts on this topic(training)<br>
Of course it irritates them that I am able to say I have never trained anyone<br>
(I assume because they cant say that) so they minimize the claim.<br>
So far nothing new. But in this case the opportunity to point out apparent hypocrisy arose with someone else deriding 'training' also.<br>
Thus we have what YOU call name dropping or 'ad hominum' attacks.<br>
Not at all, just because the post isnt under you nose doesnt mean it wasnt made.<br>
I retain all posts ever made in my memory, I do NOT feel the need to cut and paste<br>
old posts into new ones. I know that Vendrix addmitted he train<br>
NOT ONLY an irritaing player but several other people in velks. He also<br>
claimed Kzzern has done it as well. This 'I' dont find hard to believe.<br>
<br>
Since 'I' am NOT the person telling the story, the readers must choose to call<br>
Vendrix a liar IF they choose to dispute the story. No one is willing to do that.<br>
Thus my reference is to the hypocrisy of deriding training by one party and accepting it by another. To me it is either bad or good not both.<br>
<br>
Just because YOU are unaware of the prior posts, doesnt mean they didnt exist.<br>
It simply means (like so many others) you were not involved and you chose to stick<br>
your nose into an issue that you know nothing about. I am NOT obligated to explain<br>
anything to you at all.  <p>“It is clear that the individual who persecutes a man, his brother, because he is not of the same opinion, is a monster.”

I don’t need to read between the lines or send this message off to be decoded by some NSA agent, you were quite clear and quite specific when expressing your point of view on the matter of protecting one’s xp camp. You are saying that if someone came along and tried to mess with you while you were minding your own business and doing xp, you would train him or her. I agree!<br>
<br>
Hey, haven’t I heard something like this before? Let me think a second…<br>
<br>
It’s <u>exactly</u> what Ewle tried that day I turned her into a red smear on the steps of Lower Guk with a few trains, letting her know exactly how bad an idea it was to <I>f</I>uck with me. I was xp’ing with some random people, just doing my thing and she tried to take over. So, from what you penned out, I see that you condoned my actions and I had your full support in my retaliation against the infidel(don’t try to use your misspelled words to defend yourself, I know what you meant).<br>

The reference to include Vendrix or Koryo was completely a) unnecessary) b) did nothing to further the point you were attempting to make. Hence the reason it was an unmitigated ad hominum attack. Your point was simply to disparage their character nothing else.  For instance if you were to saw the following, &quot;I hate people who kill other people. Such as O.J Simpson.&quot; The O.J. Simpson part is completely unnecessary and points out a hateed for O.J Simpson. By adding the fragment &quot;Such as O.J simpson.&quot; You've added no content except that you hate O.J. simpson and that you're stating that O.J Simpson killed people. The fragment adds no merit to your orginal point. It doesn't strengthen your point and it doesn't ingraciate yourself to the reader. That is an unmitigated ad hominum attack. You're smokecreening behind your opinion to tack on an attack.<br>
<br>
Vendrix's character or Koryo's character isn't in question. No one here disputed your claim (Pesonally, I don't know what post you are referring to). I am merely trying in vain it seems to figure out why you listed them when it did nothing to further your point, but to dredge up some past alledged transgression. (See above for my questions about that).<br>
<br>
<br>
I readily admitted that I have trained people in the past. So the f what. You'll find the line of people that have bad things to say about me monumentally smaller than those who have good things to say about me. Those who &quot;like&quot; me or think I'm kind, nice, or whatever don't seem to have moral hang-ups even if they know I've trained someone. They don't seem fascinated by the alledged real life complications from the actions of a pixelated fantasy. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/unaedayr.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Naedayr</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 82<br> <font color=#E9D756>(5/30/02 9:06:59 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3364.topic&index=48>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: yes and no.</span><hr size=1> Chiteng, try posting without using the words 'They' and 'Them'.

It's geting pretty obvious that 'someone who matters' can only be 'someone who agrees with me' to you.  All other points brought up to you fizzle away as you ignore them completely.<br>

This has nothing to do with some vast game where everyone else is out to get you and score points by baiting you.  Try to get a grip on the fact that other people know about stuff, and it's getting old that you keep having to bring it up, like you are the only one who has managed to use your brain cells for long term storage.  You aren't better than anyone else here, morally, intellectually, or any other way.  You are just one of the freaks, like the rest of us.  Get used to it and accept it. <p><br><br>

No Vendrix I would NOT train them to get rid of them. I can say anything I want however. Not quite the same thing.<br>

You see to me playing the game is time spent getting xp. I am not alone in that<br>
opinion. To train someone, just invalidated the amount of time it took them to get<br>
their xp. Who gives you such a right? No one, you usurped it. Since in my opinion<br>
you do NOT have a moral imperative, that makes you 'bad'. You dont care what you did to Ewle or why, you and I both know you habitually do things to people<br>
that are 'in your way' it is of course to THOSE actions I refer.<br>
<br>
It is you doing those things with impunity that I fight. Yes you have gotten<br>

An essence emerald is the result of a <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> un-resable</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> death, much like a train you didn't get a xp giving ressurection on.  Average price 300pp.  Vendrix is evil because he destroyed someones time getting exp, which it has been by mass market on E-marr to equal 300pp.  So if I destroyed something out of spite that equals oh, I don't know... 6000pp, that would be like intentionally training 20 people in a place where they couldn't get a res.  I guess that's okay in your 'morally superior' handbook.<br>

In any case the player may not be willing to make that comparison. A player<br>
may well simply want to level as fast as he can. Thus you have destroyed his time.<br>
Or more correctly, you destroyed the 'fruits' of his expenditure of time.<br>

I really was.  But then something was said that made me smirk.  So please excuse me while I do a Chiteng-like leap to a unrelated topic.<br>
<br>
A few posts ago, Chiteng said:<br>
<br>
&quot;No Vendrix I would NOT train them to get rid of them. I can say anything I want however. Not quite the same thing.&quot;<br>
<br>
So basically, you can say you'll do anything you want, even if it's not anything you actually would do?<br>
<br>
Now the leap to the unrelated topic.  A few months back, Dwarkarn made the comment 'I'll kill you'  You and Mitch jumped all over him for that one, and I know Mitch still pokes at him about it from time to time.<br>
<br>
But I don't think it is something that Dwarkarn would actually do. (Though he's welcome to correct me if I'm wrong about that, but I doubt that anyone on this board would ever actually kill someone,  Cept the military types in the line of duty, I suppose).  But it's OK to say anything he wants, right?  So why the attempt to get him banned? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uchiteng.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Chiteng</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 1166<br> <font color=#E9D756>(5/30/02 8:51:57 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3364.topic&index=57>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ageneral</span><hr size=1> You ignore the other posts.
