<br>
<br>
Ha. Fucking. Ha.<br>
<br>
I understand that for a majority of the message board reading population of Emarr this board is the best way to get a point across.  If you want to buy something its the best way to find someone who has it.  If you want to warn people of a scammer, its the best way to warn.<br>
<br>
But request for epic help?  I'm sorry.. call me old fashioned, but I thought that Epics mean something.  At least they still do to me.  They mean that I had the guild, the help, and the friends to back me up when I kill the big beasties to complete this quest.  They aren't supposed to be items that everyone is entitled to have..They aren't supposed to be something you can buy on ebay for 500 bucks.<br>
<br>
Yes, I want a VS stone.  Yes I have thought of buying it before.  But not because I can't amass the legions to take VS down, just because VS never stays up long enough for me to get those legions.<br>
<br>
I suppose I am just a hypocrite. <br>
<br>
I understand not everything is possible for everyone.  Not every guild can do everything, I know mine still can't. <br>
<br>
I still want to throw up every time I see another druid who payed plat for someone else to kill every mob they needed for their epic.  And it bothers me that people are now using the message boards to ask for help from anyone to get an epic piece, when I watch my friends work damn hard getting their guilds organized to get those pieces.<br>
<br>
Then again, in the end everyone puts in the same $10 a month (per account anyhow :P) and its all just a game.  It shouldn't matter to me if you feel like paying people or begging people to help you play in God Mode.  I will still know in the end I earned everything I have.<br>

Yes, I was the 1st to start this off by posting some assistance to get my Warrior his epic, but this is the 2nd time for me to do an epic quest.  I finished my Shaman's epic around the same time that Bullmoosin got his &amp; frankly it was a long and tedious quest to complete.  I was doing that quest while inbetween guilds which didn't make it any easier.  Afterwards, I was very pleased to have finally finished it.  Now, I'm at the point of wanting one for my Warrior since I figure it would be less tedious to get his epic finished versus having to try &amp; buy 2 new 1HS weapons since my accounts got hacked.  I have accomplished a lot of the quest without other peoples' help &amp; now I'm at a point where, yes, a large number of people is required to kill the next few mobs.  I don't find anything wrong in asking for help here on the board.  Hell, people post things like that every day for Dragons.  I don't see the difference in asking assistance in killing a very powerful mob for other reasons.  If you feel that I'm in the wrong for posting such requests, then frankly, I don't give a damn about what you think of it nor do I care.  It was my choice to do so &amp; I made it.  You had nothing to do with it, nor did I ask you to have anything to do with it.  This is not a rant or an attack on you.  I'm just stating my defense on this issue since I was the 1st person to post for assistance &amp; then I notice that a few other people followed behind me requesting the same thing.

What makes someone more special than someone else?  Because they're in a large guild?  Some people don't have time for an &quot;uber&quot; guild.  Not saying that we're uber, but Affliction requires a certain level of activity in it's members.  We are not a casual guild.  Well, not everyone can devote a large amount of time to a game at any given time.  They are &quot;burdened&quot; by work or school or a family and can only afford to be casual players.  Does this mean that they don't deserve their epic?  Not in my opinion.<br>
<br>
Everyone is equal when they start (non twinks aside :P).  We all pay the same amount of money to play (per account).  If people want to do their epic and they can muster the help to obtain it, does it matter where that help comes from?  Say you have sufficient people to kill VS.  Does it matter if you are in the same guild as these people?<br>

I personally don't care if everyone has their epic.

<br>
  Lets take the two main hurdles he has left, the Wingblade from the Spiroc Lord in Sky, and the Blade of Whatever (Fluffybunny Sword will be used from here in) that drops from the Queen in Chardok.<br>
<br>
  It's remotely possible that you could get a pickup raid into Sky, and up to the Spiroc Island to get a Wingblade or three.  Hell, it's even possible, if you had friends in a guild doing a Sky run, that they'd take the time to get one for you as well.  It's a nasty, time consuming, EXPENSIVE process raiding in Sky, and a wipeout will do exactly that... wipe you out.  But it's possible to do.  The Wingblade is not a particulary hard part to get, comparatively.  Not a trival undertaking, but the mechanics are straight forward enough.<br>
<br>
  The Queen in Chardok, falling to a pickup raid.  Uhuh.  That could happen, and if it did I for one would be VERY impressed at the raids leadership.  The Queen, IMO, is harder to take down than Trakanon.  Not because she's tougher, but because that particular area of Chardok is brutally unforgiving of mistakes.  One error, just one, and you are going to get wiped out.  That's one of the reasons why, to the best of my knowledge, only three guilds on the server have managed to take her down.  Given this, the only way I can see the Queen being taken down is on a guild raid where everyone acts as a team and has a fair idea what they're getting into.  Expecting a guild raid to let a 51st warrior loot the Fluffybunny Blade, which isn't exactly a common drop from the Queen either, is IMO pushing things more than a little.<br>
<br>
  Saavak states that &quot;I'm at the point of wanting one for my Warrior since I figure it would be less tedious to get his epic finished versus having to try &amp; buy 2 new 1HS weapons since my accounts got hacked&quot;. I'd have to take exception with that, for a couple of reasons.  Firstly, decent weapons are fairly readily availible.  Hell, you could probably get by with a pair of Yaks if you had to. Treating the epic weapons as &quot;Easier to get than other availible 1HS weapons&quot; cheapens the effort required.  Also, by trying to get them for your 51st warrior you're effectively denying them to other warriors on your raids who, and I'm sorry if this is going to offend you, will have done far more to ensure the success of the raid than you have.<br>
<br>
  If you can take down the Queen in Chardok, and the Spiroc Lord in Sky with your warrior as the highest level non-epic equipped warrior there, you have my blessing on your endevour.  I just feel that by attempting to get them at such a low level, considering the difficulty of this particular epic to complete, you're setting yourself a goal that is both unrealistic and unfair to any other warriors who would be in for the attempt.<br>

As for sky? Yea its a difficult plane, but its also not not extrodinarily difficult to get people working together for a common goal. You never know.<br>

And yes I did chain my VS stone. But so what? Just cuz I'm not in one of the few guilds who can kill him doesn't mean I should be restricted on my epic. In fact I think its great that there are nice people out there who actually OFFER to help people like me out like that.<br>

too lazy to log in my EZ board account<br>
<br>
does that mean the person who spends 10 hours a week offandedly playing and the person who puts in 8 hours a day playing and organizing and gather thier guild together deserve the same epic reward?   If someone want the epic bad enough, then they will put in the effort to get it.  The epic weapons were not designed to be commonplace or easily obtained or just something that people could pick up on a whim.  <br>
<br>
I personally think the shaman epic and and the rogue epic are just too easy.  so many people have them that they just arent special anymore.  when you see someone walking around with a necro duck staff, or a pair of light sabers, you KNOW they put in a lot of effort for that, and it's something to be proud of.  What do you think when you see a shaman with a spear..  &quot; ohh, another one of those spear of fate's, whats new? &quot;, or the monk epic, how many people with bubbles can you count on an average night running around velious?  how many people simply consider a RB standard gear for a rogue?<br>
<br>
I do not think that everyone deserves an epic, thats not the point.  they arent called common weapons, they arent called standard equipment, they are called EPIC weapons, the crowning achievement of a persons class.  maybe it's not the best weapon in the game, but the idea of an epic quest is that it's time consuming and difficult.  something you and your friends ( usually this means guild ) come together for you and all work towards your goal.  I think it cheapens the item if 12 random people can get together on a weekend and bumble out with an epic for someone.<br>
<br>
I think a few things were screwy, like having druid and ranger stones drop off a once a week spawn.. and requiring druids and rangers to share most of thier quests, while SK's and necro quests had nothing to do with one another..  but they seem to have remedied most of the problems.<br>
<br>
I will go get my spear of fate, it's a very nice spear, and there isnt much out there that compares, but to be honest, I'll feel more pride about helping kaane get his lightsabers or bubu get his innoruuk's curse than I will for completeing my spear, simply because it was too easy.  No great effort was required to get it, no obstacle was overcome to acomplish my goal..  <br>
<br>
I walked into hole, and killed a lizard... then I walked into fear and killed a baby lizard.. then I walked into city of mist and killed a ghost... now I have a spear.. whoopdeedoo<br>

That being said, I still love my Spear of Fate.  While the quest was relatively easy, it was a wonderful storyline and it was fun to do.  The moment I turned in my scale and received the spear, I didn't feel like it was a gimpy quest, I felt I had accomplished something with my friends' help, it was a great feeling.<br>

DG has been killing the Chardok Queen and Gorenaire for a little while now. Since we usually do stuff like this on guild raids, we say our woohoos, congrats, and pat eachother on the back on our own web site. No need to post here and &quot;thank all of you who helped&quot; since they should all be reading our own site. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Besides, it seems that there exists on this server an odd class of people: those who follow DG around and take accurate head counts of how many of us are involved in any kill we manage. I'm sure if somebody posted, &quot;woohoo, Divine Grace killed the Queen, was fun, and a nice accomplishment for us,&quot; somebody would have posted, &quot;yeah, I was there in the Queen's chamber as you fought her and I managed to look around and count all of you, and by my accurate census calculations, I see that you required 754.3 trillion people to kill the her, so you are really all gimps and my penis is much longer.&quot; I bet that you people in Affliction came to a similar conclusion when after a fun and successful weekend in Sky you posted your congrats here, and got responses like &quot;geez, but it took you like 86 people, at least that's what I counted.&quot; Perhaps you realize why we aren't diligently running here to post our accomplishments any more. And please don't deny that Affliction needed 86 people to kill Bzzazzt Bzzt (errr, whatever) because I know for a fact that you did cuz I read it on this board!!!<br>
<br>
I just thought I'd post this little tidbit of info just in case somebody is keeping track, and it seems that Jaiieq is. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  If somebody sees this and decides there is flame material here, have fun flaming away (it is the flame board after all) but I doubt I'll read it, let alone reply. For those of you who worry about this sort of thing (and, oddly enough, it seems that are people who obsess over this) I think we had about 24ish people there to kill the Queen, maybe...? It was already more than the ideal number of people IMHO because of the nature of that mob and the room she's in and what not (if you've fought her before, I'm guessing you know what I mean), so having even more than that would have made it even harder - so if you wanna believe we had much more go right ahead and knock yerself out. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I can see where it would be frustrating to you to see other people in effect &quot;buy&quot; their epics while you quest after all of the required pieces. But from my point of view, I don't see it as being much different than trading for any other item. So a player can scrape up 40k in plat, or similar value in items, and wants to trade them for an epic quest item instead of, say, a some new tunic? I personally am not angry at such a person.<br>
<br>
As somebody else mentioned here, the VS remains now lead to 2 additional ranger/druid stones when spawned and killed properly. So I'm guessing that once more VS killers learn how to do this, there will be many more ranger and druid epics coming into the world. So if you don't lose heart you'll have your epic soon I'm enough (along with most rangers and druids).</font><P><P><i></i></TD></TR><TR BGCOLOR=#666666><TD NOWRAP width=20% valign=top align=left><B><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2><A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ucarathosollathir.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Carathos Ollathir</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/image/globalRainbow.gif BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10></FONT></B><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>Veteran</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>posts: </FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>501</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>(</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#E9D756>4/13/01</FONT> <FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#E9D756>8:02:47 am</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>)<BR></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT><B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">Re: Need help with Druid Epic - VS</font></B><HR><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">Well, I can only speak on doing the druid quest as that's the only one I've done, but no one just &quot;bumbles&quot; onto this weapon <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .  Whether you play 10 hours a week or 8 hours a day, you still have to camp the same rare spawns, you still have to sit on your arse and forage the items for one part (that part alone took me 10 hours to do and from the stories I've heard from others, I got lucky) and, unless you buy the VS stone from someone who does him regularly, you still have to amass the people to kill the mobs you can't solo.<br>
<br>
I actually got 2 parts of my quest chained for me.  One was from a cleric friend who killed the corrupt goblin while he was camping the spawn for his epic (thanks Impman) and the other was a VS stone we got in a trade with another guild before we got into the rotation (thanks MS).  Does this mean I don't deserve my epic or that I didn't work hard to get it?  Nope.  I can camp a goblin, I'm in a guild that can kill VS, I just got lucky.<br>
<br>
Just because someone isn't in a large guild doesn't mean they don't deserve help obtaining what they want to in this game.  Whether that means buying a VS stone or amassing people he's never met to help him kill a mob doesn't matter.  Hell, how many times has an enchanter looted naggy/vox books to chain for a paladin to get his FA in the old world?  No difference.  Better than letting them rot.</font><P><a href=http://www.afflictionguild.com/scripts/member.x?username=Carathos&charactername=Carathos>Carathos Ollathir<BR><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/bthedruidsgrove> 59th Druid<BR> <a href=http://www.afflictionguild.com/>~Affliction~<BR>
