I remember when Paw was a Noobie zone and I could go all the way in with my umber lvl 24 character.  High hold used to have two full groups on Orc side with lists and wizards on the side lines ks'ing.  I remember this little Gnome named Pimm that thought he was hot shit because he could solo the tower in Crushbone while people like me and Colby and some others had to remain in the throne room.  CT camp were umber.  Every camp early in the morning was held by a high level necro Lower Guk (well I guess that is still the same).  I about shit when a paladin named Mithian handed me over his bp of ro (I was only lvl 30) because he got a totally umber black enamled bp.  I remember Dandoy slapping everyone skin and we went to camp a paladin sword for Rindwen and she fell asleep when the frog finally spawned with a sword.  Dondor in his 20's, I was in my 40's asking me about temple of ro faction increasing quests.  Kelnariv was like my personal enchanter in ct and lower guk.  We tore up some stuff in there.  *I remember the first day of Lanys when we lined up on the wall of qyenos to make a guild*  That was stellar.  I remember a good clearic by the name of Lilathe.  A barbarian shaman named Bigash that we called...well..you know.  I remember beating Asteroth when he was lvl 19 and I was 18.  He kept stunning me for ever (what was mezz?) so I ran to the top of the gfay spires and waited for him to log or zone.  Getting my Bone Bladed Claymore at 20 and waiting in the qyenos arena for newbies to cross the area to turn in gnoll teeth and rooting them then layin the smack down by hitting my umber double 40's.  Snake pit in Black Burrow was the place to be.<br>

(Took me 3 hours total to find the cleric trainer and find nek forest, due to the dumb maps in the book.)<br>
<br>
First relization I didn't like playing a cleric... encountered two guys, Sllasher and Denz in Oasis, healed one low on life, one of their orcs (had 7 on them) ran at me, I feared it off (greenie at the time), and they tried /tell bombing me until I put them on /ignore, then tried training specs around Oasis until a GM came, then they started behaving.  I got tired of that, started hosing down skellies in sro.  Got tired of my DE cleric, made a HE cleric.  Realized how bad the newbies were at level 5 in gfay, and stayed in Butcherblock from 5-15.<br>
<br>
First plane entry:  I got Cendien to 50, was wandering around Wakening lands... saw a big shroom atop of a tower in water.  *poof* welcome to PoG.  Wandered about until I found Tunare, gave her some whips.<br>
<br>
First death:  Spiderlings in nek forest.  Every newbie DE knows what I'm talking about, which are annoying, but not as bad as a skelly when you are low-level.<br>
<br>
First twinking:  Drop-traded 5pp and some bone chips to jump start my necro, then (until it was nerfed.)  when swapping gear between chars, would suicide, have the other char loot the /consented corpse.  (man, that was a great twinking way, as it was totally secure.)<br>
<br>
First encounters with trains:  Grouping at edge of Najena at level 9, and some people kept getting their butts whooped by the TT's, or the ogre guards.  Remembering how big a victory it was with Vekanos in putting down a red-con ogre guard...<br>
<br>
Its funny how equipment has changed.  When I had my first incarnation of Utyan, it would take 3 people, and a HT to down a YK at level 7... when I made my mark 2 SK, a few slams with a poison wind censer, and it was a rug.<br>

<br>
/sigh back in the days when all feared the wizzy....before there was such a thing as uber weapons past yaks and before tanks could do more damage in a few fights then a wizard can. IC ruled so much....<br>
<br>
 Also recall rogues been considered a waste of a class. Kinda funny, look at all the old time peeps that still play their first chars....how many old old school rogues we got left on lanys...not to many heh. Diirk was the man back in the day in solidare<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Other then that i dont even remeber many high lvl rogues before the rog twink plague started.<br>
<br>
 This is still why i am looking foward to shadowbane, for that new first time experince, but i fear that to many losers will be playing the game right away and it might make for a not very apealing start.
