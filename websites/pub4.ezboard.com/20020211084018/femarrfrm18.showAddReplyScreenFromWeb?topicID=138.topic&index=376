<br>
At first blush I would say your response was very tense and I can understand why. So let me just say that I will not be turning this into a flame. I know you are &quot;swearing off the thread&quot; <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  but I hope you do read the following. Before I get started I thank you for the offer to email you. I extend the same offer to you &lt;pierce@speakeasy.net&gt;.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> &quot;You may have provided a link, but that doesn't make it true, Lurikeen. (...) You are basically stating that there is one writer who believes that these documents are false, and by stating they are false, it makes them so. There are many other historians and scholars who do not consider these sources to be false. I'm not the scholar. You're not the scholar.&quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I provided a link only to give credit to the scholar who wrote the paper. I even went so far to state that I disagree with his conclusion. Are you sure you read my post carefully? Also, I am not saying because &quot;one writer who believes&quot; documents are false makes the documents false. Again, carefully consider what it was that I actually wrote. I will repeat, there are no documents contemporary to Jesus when he allegedly lived that speak of him or his family. Zero documents. The later documents that purport to speak of Jesus are either fraudulent (as is the case with the Josephus insertions) or not trustworthy. I provided you with just one internet source. I can provide you with a long standing list of scholars who agree with my assesment? Many of which are &quot;liberal Christians&quot;.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> &quot;You are correct in my mentioning that the scrolls do not contain the Christian canon in its entirety. It contains the Hebrew Bible. Which is part of the Christian Bible.&quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Nope. That is not true Lukaria. The dead sea scrolls contain fragments of specific books found in the Christian Old Testament. The Hebrew canon was not agreed upon until the Second Century CE so could not possibly contain the &quot;Hebrew Bible&quot; as you say. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> &quot;First,I am not sure what this has to do with the actual birth, death and rez of Jesus? I mentioned the Dead Sea Scrolls as proof of the validity of the Bible (or parts thereof), carbon dated actually from 250 bc to 90 ad (some say 6 . The earliest manuscript of Mark is actually dated to withing 20 years of Christ's death. If you mention the canonization fo the Bible as evidence that Christ did not exist, well here is an answer for you which includes Old and New testament.&quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
It has a lot to do with it. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  First, the early Christian church could not agree with what texts should be considered &quot;authoratative&quot;. Many different texts and oral traditions were floating about. Some of which claimed Jesus never died on the cross, that he was not crucified, that he had married and has children, etc. To this day, Lukaria, scholars are still skeptical as to whether or not the book of Revelation should be kept in the canon! The point is that the literature you turn to and use as &quot;evidence&quot; is really shaky at best. It is not contemporary to Jesus, the authors are unknown, the originals of the texts are lost forever, and what fragments and manuscripts are available have been grossly tampered with by scribes through out the ages. I read the quote you provided, too. Who are you quoting? Looks like a piece by Josh McDowell. At any rate, I can quote other Christian scholars who would flagrantly disagree with the source you provided.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> &quot;The Messiah is explicity mentioned many times. jesus us not mentioned by name, only the Messiah. I can, however, give some arguments for you of examples.&quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I am not even going to get into the so-called proof you offer based on the fullfillment of prophecies. Christians can't even agree on the nature of the prophetic content found in the Christian bible. I want to point out that there are several &quot;Messiahs&quot; mentioned by both the Hebrews and Romans around the time Jesus purportedly lived. A precursory understanding of biblical history would show you that the Hebrew traditions found in their apocalyptic writings always contain references to Messiahs generically as individuals who save them from their enemies. Interpretation of biblical references is a daunting task which has lead to the formation of hundreds of schisms in the Christian church throughout history. I would not pretend that there is a monolithic Christian view or interpretation of the Bible. At any rate, Jesus is not explicitly mentioned in the Dead Sea scrolls and Messianic references contained there in will not be helpful either, since the question will always be &quot;Which Messiah is being referred to?&quot;<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> &quot;You bring up other religions and their validity. Of course I don't believe that these other religions are 100% true. I certainly do not believe that Mohammed performed any miracles. And no, I don't believe that the book of Mormon is correct. If someone could give me as much hard evidence as I have for Jesus, I would look at these other religions again. I helped a friend investigate these other religions, nothing else made sense to me Lurikeen. However, that is not so for everyone.&quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
The point I raised Lukaria was a good answer to your question as to whether or not I believed that the Christian religion could be &quot;made up&quot; by a few people. Even you agree that Islam and even Morminism have been &quot;made up&quot; by individuals. Hence, it is not impossible that Christianity was also invented by a group of people. We certainly see that the major religions are created by the inspiration of individuals carried through time by their followers. Right? Why should Christianity be exempt? You see, I have never understood why some Christians are so caught up with needing historical proof to validate their faith. Why would a Christian really care if the bible is just a collection of fairy tales? Isn't the message contained in the pages what's important? /shrugs<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> &quot;I must in the end, thank you. you have made me look up answers to questions and investigate my faith in order to attempt to debate with you, and it has truly deepened my belief and my faith and my conviction. I know you don't believe as I do, thats ok Lurikeen. I still wish you well, I still think you are a worthy human being. I still hope you find fulfillment in this life.&quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
You are welcome Lukaria. Anytime <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I sincerely wish you well, too. If I didn't respond to a point you would have liked me to, please put it on the table. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>Lurikeen Mali'Kyre<BR>
