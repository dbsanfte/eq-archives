I don't know if it would work or if people would actually want to do this but here is my take. The GM's will never do anything to punish an action like this for this reason. If they take the word of an individual and take the item back then they will set a presedence that others may be able to exploit or use to scam. They have too many problems to go out and investigate to the extent needed. So he is my idea (not sure if it has been thrown out before).<br>
<br>
Set up a court system on each server where individual player characters are set up as like a judge. A panel of three could sit and listen to both sides of an argument and then make a rulling. Each side could have a set amount of time to make its point and call anyone as a witness. After the time is up the panel decides and their ruling is binding. The ruling could be anything from suspension, banning, warning, resitution or no action. If the ruling was baning/suspension they forward their results to the lead GM and the action is taken. <br>
<br>
The panel would need to have like a chief justice who would be responsible for assigining panel members to insure fairness. There could be 6-9 panel members per server so as to have the oppertunity to do multiple sessions and to ensure extra's are around if the accuser/accused is a friend/guildmate etc.  The panel could meet in a town or zone where everyone could attend and the precedings could use the various chat channels to communicate.<br>
<br>
This setup would do a few important things. It allows US the ability to police ourselves. It allows the accused and accuser the oppertunity to state their case at the same time. Allows the GM's (IF any are on) to do other stuff and allows for swift foreclosure on an event/problem to name a few.<br>
<br>
Of course this system would not be for all events. Just because X stole your kill once does not mean it would go infront of the panel. But after you post on the SL that X stole your kill and then 20 peeps come forward then maybe it would. Just a thought.<br>
<br>
One last thing. The panel could be voted on by the whole server. Peeps who are interested could post on the board and then maybe patch something to the server that lets us all vote when the day arrives (no hanging chad allowed).<br>
<br>
Ok, just my 2CP worth. I feel this game should be more then just going out and hitting your attack key or a spell gem (I simplified that). I think we should get involved in our little world. That way we can find other peeps to blame other then the GM and Verant. Like I said, just my 2CP. I have other ideas if anyone is interested :)<br>

Tira has handled most of the situation herself, and has willed to give a pair of leggings back to Gae, so this will be my last post here, hopefully.<br>
<br>
But I have to make a couple corrections---<br>
<br>
Sallof was not forcibly removed from 9R after the incident-- Arayian, his first char with 9R was, however.  This was a miscommunication.<br>
<br>
After Arayian burned a Cleric in LOIO (promising 200pp for a rez, then actually, yes, he really did this, trying to work out a plan on how he could not pay her and try to get suggestions openly in /guildchat, finally to get the rez, loot his corpse and /q) he was already deep in shit with the majority of the Officers.  Since it was his first offense, and we smoothed over the situation with the Cleric and her guild, we allowed him to stay.<br>
<br>
This situation in EC, however, was his second offense, and obviously he knew he would be in even deeper with us (and his only defending Officer, Tira, was as well losing patience in him) and most likely /guildremoved himself trying to evade our pending action.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  Also, i joined another guild in the LCG so i would be easily able to continue a relationship with 9R, which has now been sadly scared for my &quot;actions&quot; i guess. And hopefully before i actually do get kicked out of CoN i will be able to inform Nephyur that i like the quiet peaceful and friendly (tight group we are) guild of 9R, if i can ever rejoin...<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
9R is patient-- but we're not stupid.<br>
<br>
Sorry, we don't let thieves, tricksters, or general assholes into our guild.  And we <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  especially</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> don't let members back in whom decide they want to <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  try out</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> other guilds for a while.<br>

It's interesting how far someone will go, moving on up in the world, so to speak.  This time it wasn't some low level Cleric, no it was the leader of Knights of Flame, instead --<br>

<br>
I told him who I was, that he had my paladin's leggings. Basically he told me that he had given them away and was trying to get them back, that he would return them as soon as he could.<br>
<br>
Sallof, I'm glad you think I'm a nice person. I wasn't particularly trying to be nice. I was simply listening. That doesn't mean I believed what you had to say. I don't believe the bear thing, and I don't believe you thought the legs were a gift. <br>
<br>
And what was that about zoning and not hearing any shouts? I was standing with Gaealis while he shouted several times about the legs, and if you had zoned you would have no longer been in his target window. You especially should have seen the shouts if your auctions were turned off.<br>

This is Gaealismule/Zodian/Gaealis, LEADER of the Knights of Flame, for those who haven't figured it out yet.../pokes Sallof.<br>
<br>
I would just like to say that I have the log where sallof admits to being invisible, and If I can remember when I get home from work, I will post the chat log so all can see.  <br>
<br>
Don't ever try to say that what I post is a lie, I will bury you! It's not even like the legs mean anything to me, they were for a friend (Ratutu) and had no real value for me.  My Paladin wears mostly dragon armor and barbed, so the silver is a bit of a down grade for me.  It was equipment ment for fellow guildmates, to help out when ever I could, now I have to bother myself buy taking time out to defend myself to someone who is a lier and a thief! Not Cool!  <br>
<br>
I hope you enjoy the leggings, which either you or Visgaroth have.  Oh and by the way, he contacted me and basically called me a F'n A'hole and said there is nothing I can do to get them back from him, and that everybody can just kiss his arse!! That means all you nice people that have posted on my behalf as well, figured you'all might have something to say about that...just to repeat, the name was VISGAROTH!  He basically told me when his character meet mine he will kick my pally arse...12 rogue vs my 40 pally ...hmmm.  Anyway, you can see that they must both be very young, as usually giving the young people on the server a bad name.<br>

   The act of saying not to change anything gives me the impression he is trying to seed the &quot;plausable deniability&quot; if the logs ARE posted.  He has already (in his mind) set the seeds of doubt on the reliabilty of said logs.<br>
   And he KNOWS full well no GM will do a trade record and bother to come post anything on the lanys SL.  So making that request sounds all well and good, except its not plausible.  Again, trying to make his side seem more solid than it is.<br>
   It is THIS kind of deceit that really bugs me.  This is the more subtle type of dishonesty that really defines people, and I do pick up on it.<br>

   And for a related anecdote:  I had a level 3 non twink  Druid Halfling.  A trade window pops up with a nice item that DRU can wear, a tunic.  (Dont recall which).  I ASKED if it was intended for me.  And thanked the benefactor profusely.  Then when I tried to equip it....damn, no halflings.  I IMMEDIATELY sent a tell informing the person I cannot equip it and they should take it back.  I was told to take it to EC and sell it, and I would be set for plat for a long time.  They intended for me to have it and use it, or sell it.  But I VERIFIED first.  This is just the way things should be done.<br>

Like Kapow said, you really outdid it for finding the two biggest brain dead morons on the server yet to be seen.<br>

Yep, he certainly earned his spot up here.  His buddy's name should be in the title, too, though, I agree.  They're both equally rotten. <p><IMG SRC="http://home.swbell.net/sdspies/images/mustelasig.jpg" BORDER="0" WIDTH="216" HEIGHT="212" alt="Image courtesy The Ferret Company http://www.ferretcompany.com/"><br><b>Mustela Furo</b>, Gnome Necromancer of the 55th Essence Emerald<br><b>Valencia Draconis</b>, Sacrificial Port Mule of the 51st Foraged Vein Worm</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uarayian.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Arayian</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>n00b!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(1/8/02 11:26:52 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=729.topic&index=60>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Sallof : Ec Tunnel Thief</span><hr size=1> If you read the above posts you would hear me talk about how I was being ignorant and talking like I didnt speak good english, just wanted to point that out.<br>
<br>
Yes I said I was invisible but no I wasnt, it was a hasty reply to try and get my ass out of trouble, but thats besides the point, becuase im a scum...<br>
<br>
I did give away my stuff and gave my account to a friend but I got my account back, figuring I shouldnt run from my problems when they really arent problems. I will still do as I always do, standing at the tunnel for hours sowing and healin and buffing those in need, taking donatings for those that feel generous, having a good ale in Katta with friends and what not. Nothing will change, except I will take screenshots of the Trade, Time, and first shourt/tell from the person.<br>
<br>
Nephyur im sorry you felt that way about me, I would have left the guild earlier if you asked, though it wouldnt be my greatest feelings but still for a friend you once were I would have done so you didnt get a bad name and put ALL the blame on good ole Sallof so 9R stays all clean and perky as it always was.<br>
<br>
I dont hold grudges so any of you I see in game wont be judged or harshly treated. I mean Zodian could have given me a chance, but still if he or ANYONE wants something and I can help, im usually there.<br>
<br>
I just want you all to know, I really dont mean to be immature or rude or anything but, I didnt learn a lesson. This Shit List thing really was just so you all could have someone to flame. I read many of the past posts and all that most you reply are &quot;What a dick&quot;. Lol. You wonder why these lists go on and on is becuase people dont really give for it, I replied becuase I did, I almost quit becuase I did, but now i realize that its what you people are here to do, make me mad so you feel better, It didnt work =P. Almost!<br>
<br>
I do think it sad of Nephyur to come out on EVERY forum and basically say, &quot;IM SORRY EVERYONE IT WAS HIS FAULT, HIS!&quot; Yes responsible but really... c'mon your better then that!<br>
<br>
Anyway Ill leave you all to frantically use words to rape my name while im playing, as a matter of fact, Im hoping to beat that Uzziel fellow in replies, Haha.<br>
<br>
Be safe!<br>
