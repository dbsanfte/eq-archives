*** WARNING *** The following is LONG and GRAPHIC.<br>
<br>
…<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
..Journal entry 31, Mines of Nurga<br>
<br>
<br>
The arm came swinging through the air, severed neatly at the shoulder, the black scaly fist still clinging to the whip in a death grip. The agonizing scream of the mortally wounded Whipcracker echoed off the mountain walls like so many before it. With a flick of my wrist, I sent the razor sharp Nathsar screaming through the Goblins throat, ending the vile beasts misery.<br>
<br>
The Goblin carcass won’t last long even hidden in the lush knee high deep grass of the Frontier Mountains. The rolling hills capped with stands of trees bordered by impassable mountain walls, is home to voracious Brutes, Mountain Giants, Burynai, and of course the viscous Goblins who would never pass up a free meal, even if its one of their own.<br>
<br>
With a quick, thankful glance upward to The Rainkeeper, I beset upon the Goblin Plaguebringer that Raikul was trying to wrestle off the Druid Iildare. The human monk Raikul continuously pounded the Plaguebringer, his onslaught a dizzying barrage of kicks and punches that my keen half-elven eyes could never hope to follow. <br>
<br>
Already there were huge gashes opening up in the side of Raikul’s lithe frame, the Plaguebringers four inch claws meeting no resistance when it did manage to land a blow on the lightning quick Raikul.<br>
“What’s taking Jobrien?” I thought. With a furtive glance I search for my Elven friend, worried that another vile goblin has been attracted by the thick smell of blood in the air. Goblins’ sense of smell is uncanny, and even more so when blood was in the air.<br>
<br>
At last! The familiar soft rhythmic chants from the Cleric can be heard from the crest of the hill not too far away. I recognize the healing chant intertwined with Raikul’s name that he always refers to as his “Greater” in practice sessions. (So long ago in Kelethin it seems). I always try to remember the cadence of that particular spell, but my mastery of the cleric art is still in its infancy.<br>
<br>
Though I’ve seen the phenomenon thousands of times before, I’m still awestruck by it. The gaping wounds in the side of Raikul, some down to the bone, close and knit with an audible puckering sound. Raikul, energized, continues his onslaught.<br>
Wakened from my reverie by the sound of Iildare’s pained yelps, I turn the mighty Nathsar Greatsword into a prod, aiming for a vital spot on the Plaguebringer, trying to taunt it off the unarmored wolf.<br>
<br>
Success! The Plaguebringer turns to face me, chunks of meat in his teeth adding to the putrid stench emanating from its gaping maw. With horror, I see a small finger with a ring on it hanging from the beast’s mouth. We had apparently interrupted his meal. With sadness I remember the dead halfling we passed a little while back on our way to these mines.<br>
<br>
The Goblin’s Black soulless eyes lock into mine, the hatred in there unimaginable. Unwaveringly, I return the death glare through the eye slots of my Skull shaped Barbute. Out of the corner of my eye I see Iildare spring twenty feet to safety in one fluid motion. No sooner had her four paws touched the ground, she was reciting the incantation to a powerful poison spell. Jobrien healing the wolf in mid-air.<br>
<br>
The force of Iildare’s spell stuns the Plaguebringer, knocking the tattered finger loose from its mouth and the ring loose from the finger. With a renewed energy I riposte the Goblin’s frantic claw and slash down across its chest, the Nathsar slicing through bone and cartilage. At the same moment, Raikul lands a powerful roundhouse kick that catches the dazed Goblin on the side of the head, the force of the blow knocking its eye from its socket to land beside the halfling’s finger. Fitting. <br>
<br>
“Caber, watch out! Slavedriver!” Iildare’s shrill cry pops into my head. The special gift of communicating telepathically amongst guild members is a Norrathian phenomenon. It has no boundaries and is the way Iildare talks whilst in wolf form.<br>
<br>
My guild member’s warning is too late. I plunge headlong down an embankment, a Goblin Slavedriver in hot pursuit. I can feel his fine steel dagger has hit a kidney, and the pain is overwhelming. The injury is bad, especially after my fight with the Plaguebringer has left me in a weakened state.<br>
Jobrien yells out that we have yet another adder. “ Taskmaster!” he yells as Raikul rushes to protect the cleric from certain death. <br>
<br>
From behind me I hear Iildare’s “snare” chant against the powerful Goblin. Undeterred, the Slavedriver beats on me relentlessly, its offensive and defensive skills far surpassing mine. It has opened up some deep wounds on me, leaving me little choice.<br>
<br>
Turning my eyes upwards to look at my Deity, only the whites of my eyes showing, I ready the words that I have known since birth, a rare and special gift bestowed only onto the holy warriors of Norrath. <br>
Reciting the words and placing one hand upon my head, the other upon my heart, the Rainkeeper judges me, and heals my battered body.<br>
<br>
I race up the hill to aid Raikul against the goblin Taskmaster. Jobrien is trying to fend off the Taskmasters rain of blows, the Goblin’s wicked claws trying to get past the Chitin shield. <br>
Once again Iildare chants her snare mantra, this time on the Taskmaster who’s lightning fast attacks have started to penetrate Jobrien’s defenses.<br>
<br>
I start in on the Taskmaster, trying to direct his attack to me. The Slavemaster, enraged at being slowed by Iildare, attacks her ferociously.<br>
“Add! Brute.” Jobrien’s strained voice resounds from atop the hill.<br>
The Gorging Brutes of Frontier Mountains are fierce gorilla-like creatures with long fangs and thick, coarse hair that can only be pierced with the sharpest of weapons.<br>
<br>
It is apparent that we are in trouble. Jobrien and Iildare, mana supplies depleted, Raikul, bleeding profusely from numerous wounds, and me, injured and tiring quickly from swinging the six-foot Greatsword, needed to get away somehow. I turn towards Iildare’s attackers in hopes of taunting them so she may escape, but I may be too late.<br>
.<br>
“Zone! To the mines!” yells Jobrien as his body glows a radiant yellow from his newly cast Divine Aura. The Taskmaster, once so intent on the cleric, seemingly forgets his target and renews his attack on me. <br>
<br>
“Ayaaaaaaaaaaaaaa! “ the blood-curdling scream signifying the casting of a spell from a Goblin Bonecharmer rips through the air. The Bonechanters, Shamans that possess powerful poison and disease incantations, count as one of the most formidable creatures living in this mountain range. They root the unwary traveler and then dot them with their poisons and disease, finishing them off with wicked barbed spears.<br>
<br>
The “whummpfff” of expelled air from Raikul told me right away that he’d been poisoned. <br>
“Zone! Zone!Zone!” came the frantic cries from Jobrien. Turning towards the mines some 200 feet away, I start off on weary legs, urging my comrades further. If we could get between the guards and plunge over the waterfall directly inside the mine, we could meditate and heal. Unlike their cousins the Aqua-Goblins in Dagnor’s Cauldron, these Goblins shun the water and will not follow.<br>
<br>
Dizzy from the loss of blood, I concentrate on the yellow glow surrounding the cleric who is near the entrance. The Bonecharmer’s shrill cries echo off the mountain walls down through the valley as if to say “All intruders must die!”<br>
<br>
Hearing footsteps race up behind me, I fervently hope that it is my comrades following me to our safe haven. Those thoughts are dashed as the crack of a whip and a searing pain in my back tell me that the Slavemaster is no longer occupied with the brave Iildare or the valiant Raikul. With a dread fascination, I realize that can only mean one thing.<br>
<br>
Only feet from the waterfall, Jobrien waits for me, steely eyes burning, Sap of Piety raised as his last defense. The Slavemaster’s relentless assault on my unprotected back has left me near death. I notice a deafening roar as I collapse to my knees. So this is what death feels like. Rainmaker, I’m coming home. Blackness.<br>
<br>
I feel a sharp tug under my arm. So this is what it feels like to be torn apart and eaten. <br>
<br>
“MOVE!” The commanding tone from Jobrien jarred into my ear, as he pulls me up simultaneously swinging his Sap of Piety at the Slavemaster.<br>
<br>
Surprising strength from a High Elf is all I could think. <br>
<br>
There was that deafening roar again and I could feel a cool spray on my face. How many times could I die?<br>
<br>
We had reached the waterfall! <br>
<br>
My excitement quickly subsided as I painfully remembered the fate of my two good friends Iildare and Raikul. With gritty determination and steely resolve, I forced my legs to move, swearing with all my heart that the vile Goblins would pay. <br>
<br>
“Iildare and Raikul will be avenged!” I vowed as me and Jobrien plunge over the three hundred foot waterfall……………..<br>
