I'd like to see a civil end to this which benefits the large and the small.  Honestly I thought a 3 day camp was insane so doubling that makes it worse.  Camping doesn't do it for me then so we either go with a rotation type thing or FFA it from my standpoint.  Sagemon leader of a guild which I have no doubt is quite capable of taking on RF has already stated rotation will fail from his guilds perspective.<br>
<br>
So where does this leave us?  Fooked if I know.<br>

I can't remember who the cleric was that said the cleric epic was more a guild piece than for the player.<br>
<br>
I can't agree more. My cleric epic would mean nothing to me without my guild. Wow, without my guild the cleric epic would only be a source of aggrivation. Can you imagine the tells you get for res's standing there at a zone with your epic. <br>
<br>
Anyhow, I just want to add that we have been camping RF for me going on 120+ hours now and the support from other clerics and guilds have been great. They are not there to KS, they are there to claim the next camp and offer support. We have 2 clerics there now who worked it out whos next and a third wanting to take the spot after that. I am not a computer geek. I work 5 days a week from 7:30am to 5:30pm. I belong to a great guild and we work together on things. Its been a tough camp, but I am so proud of Eternal Haven. The officers have not left there since Tuesday. (They haven't played for 120 hours straight) but when they log on they are there till they have to log. Our members have been in and out taking turns keeping 2 and 3 exp groups going. They could be somewhere else getting exp and nice loot, but they're not. They are there supporting their guild. Not once were they asked to be there, they just came. They may leave and go to Chardok or Os or something, but they come back and take a turn in the groups. I love you guys and gals, your the greatest! Friends from other guilds have been great too. Free Company members have been in and out, getting exp and giving moral support and keeping us going. The zone OOC's of support cheering us on are awesome. <br>
<br>
So, on that note...FFA would suck..I would hate to be the guild that KS a camp from one of these clerics that has had to camp Ragefire or has to camp him in the future. The reputation you would carry would not be worth it. If your epic is important to you, you will find a way to camp the camp and take your turn. You'd be surprised at how much support and backup you would get if you just play nice. I have had 2 or 3 guilds (maybe more) tell me that if they are there and we get wiped for some reason and they finish it off, they will let me loot it. You can't ask for better people than that. I love this server and for the most part I think 90% of the players have a big heart and are usually willing to do the right thing.<br>

I would not want to be the PR rep for a guild that didn't, but I tell you I am positive it will happen at some point.  <br>

I do see both sides tho..... and we had a rotation during my camp set up for the next like 3 clerics.. note that **it fell apart**  with the cleric after me.  Rotations only last as long as everyone plays nice.<br>

I am glad your camp has been a nice one.  Sadly, I'd say you are the exception to the rule right now.  <br>

My guild is European, and as a result, all work. No students to sit there for 6 nights. We are not willing to abandon the opportunity to get cleric epics.<br>
<br>
I put a post on the general board inviting discussion about this and suggesting the dual camp system I already mentioned above. If no arrangement is amde though, we will be starting to tell people camping RF that they have 1 hour to kill, or leave. The alternative is to tell all our clerics they wont get their epics, and since both they and the guild need them, that isn't going to happen.<br>
<br>
This isn't something I find at all pleasant, but I dont really see another way if no agreement is made. As far as we are concenred, the 'single longass camp' system is gone. So its either a dual camp, or a rotation of some sort (and I really don't know how a rotation would be worked out since I expect there would be 300 people on it).<br>

This statement only reinforces my feeling that the camp system is unworkable from our point of view. <br>
<br>
I assume that to be on this 'list' you have to sit alongside whoever is camping ragefire and wait there to take the camp from them. So instead of a 6 day camp it becomes what? A 9 day camp? Since we cannot manage 6 days I don't see us managing 9.<br>

<br>
Of course, then you wouldn't have to camp it either for 6 days.. when he popped, you could have like trak - 24 hours to kill - heh unless the new merchant despawns. ?  Anyone know? <br>
<br>
And yes, it does kind of stink for the euro guilds..<br>
<br>
I don't think the AK idea is a bad one.....  Euro guild in the AM and a US time guild in the evening?<br>
<br>
Or a rotation of sorts?<br>
<br>
I'd be willing to keep track of any list to begin with, provided that all RF capable guilds agree to something.<br>
<br>
Otherwise, we are looking at FFA or a 6 day camp.<br>
<br>
Pesonally, the FFA respected camp sounds easier, but I think a lot of clerics don't want that - mostly because after sitting for 6 days they don't want to lose the spawn.<br>
<br>
Perhaps everyone needs to talk to their guilds, or refer them to the threads discussing this and then WE as a server decide what we should do.<br>
<br>
Keep in mind that not all small guilds are RF capable.  There wouldn't be as many guilds on the rotation as you think.. but if a guild can do Trak, they can do RF.  So you are looking at one shot every .. what.. 2 months?  Thats really not that feasible - if you have 5 clerics waiting for epics, that means 10 months?  Or am I faulty in my calculations.<br>
<br>
Another possiblity, have a rotation of clerics, and the next force to be up is waiting in case of wipe?  Then the cleric that messes gets to try again the next spawn if they missed out, but again, if wiped - the person after that goes??<br>
<br>
I really don't know whats best.. I am simply throwing out random ideas.....<br>
<br>
Lets get all RF capable guilds to discuss in /guildforums and then post ideas here? <br>
<br>
Or perhaps we should have a big meeting of all guild leaders to decide as a server whether mobs should become FFA or what.. that'd be a party.<br>
<br>
Any ideas folks??<br>

Laoke asked --<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> So what do you suggest as an alternative Sagemon? <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
FFA.  Yes, that has a lot of warts.  Believe me, I know what those warts are.  But the notion that someone is entitled to Ragefire because they sat on their butt in Skyfire for six days is just insane.<br>
<br>
If someone wants to preserve the Ragefire camp, you had better come up with a system, or a justification, that addresses the <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> entirely legitimate</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> concerns of people like me and Draelyn.  All of the cozy arrangements that worked back in Sol B -- including the lists -- are going out the window.<br>
<br>
Laoke, if you or anyone else thinks that I'm happy about this, you're dead wrong.  If Verant had left the spawn along, I would have played the game in Sol B just like everyone else.  I can deal with a three-day spawn, and so can most other clerics.  By doubling the spawn time, Verant screwed us all over.<br>
<br>
Theo said --<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Please don't think I'm disagreeing with you, because I'm not. Just throwing out another perspective is all.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
If it sounds like I'm snarling, you're right.  But it's not you that is making me mad, it's what Verant has done to this spawn.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> I think the heart of the discussion is about morality, not rules. If folks believe that &quot;putting in the time&quot; constitutes &quot;entitlement&quot;, then we've got a bottleneck. Perhaps one big enough to constitute the need of a rotation.<br>
<br>
If folks believe that &quot;might equals right, we've got the levels, the speed, the organization, and the power&quot; constitutes &quot;entitlement&quot;, then the competition gets fierce and potentially ugly.<br>
<br>
I have an opinion, just as anyone else does. But I personally would like to spell out that the whole question here is what constitutes &quot;entitlement&quot;, no more and no less.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Yes, I agree with that.  You could apply the same analysis to VS, Trak, named dragons in ToV, etc.  This principle runs through much of the high level game.<br>
<br>
In the context of the Ragefire spawn, I personally reject the notion that &quot;putting in the time&quot; equals &quot;entitlement,&quot; because (1) the amount of time is just too extreme to be worthy of respect, (2) a lot of people are going to refuse to invest the time for legitimate reasons that have nothing to do with laziness, and (3) the spawn is too important to be allocated only to people who are willing and able to invest six days.<br>
<br>
Theo's comments had just about gotten me calmed down again.  Theo's good at that.  And then Caelie dropped this bombshell --<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> We have 2 clerics there now who worked it out whos next and a third wanting to take the spot after that.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

After reading those words, I'm ready to take this stupid camp FFA right now.  Who the fuck do you think you are?  You're saying that you've arranged all the Ragefire camps for the next three weeks by agreement among yourselves.  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> This bullshit cannot continue.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  At this point, I have zero respect for the camp and for the cozy arrangements that people are using to tie up the spawn.<br>

<br>
<br>
  I think you unfairly assume that somehow everyone in the US playing EQ is a student or has alot of time. Caelie stated above that she works all day. Fendellar who camped this last works all day. I bet at least 40% of the clerics who camp RF work all day. People just work it out. You people on the other side of the world need to work and sleep, well so do we. Your assumption that the people of your guild have no time and everyone else does is outrageous. I don't disagree with the 30 minutes to engage thing, what I disagree with is your seeming unwillingness to actually think about this, and to support your guild in working out solutions that respect the whole community. Hell, AK is huge and EH is relatively small and low-level, but THEY made it go right to support their cleric for 5 or 6 days and get her an epic. Is AK not close-knit enough to do the same? <br>
<br>
  I don't want to flame anybody here or piss anyone off (hmm, too late?), but I wish you would put a little more thought into this. I understand your guild needs epiced clerics but, so do other guilds. If they somehow re-arrage their lives and support each other just based on friendship and comraderie then you might consider respecting that, and working towards being able to do that as a guild. You guy probably have enough people to take him out online almost all the time, and if  you don't then you could do what EH must have done. I bet that EH had to put some serious planning and get alot of cooperation from every 50+ member in order to keep a large enough force on all the time for week. I'm not trying to bring the wrath of AK down on me, but think about what you are saying please. If EH can do it it I think you can too.<br>

  Caelie did not decide who gets the next camp, that was decided when the cleric sat down with her and spent the time there to ensure that it would be theirs.  So far, this has been the only way to ensure that you get the next camp.<br>
