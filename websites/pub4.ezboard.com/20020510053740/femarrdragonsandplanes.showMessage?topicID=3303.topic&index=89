<br>
You did bring up ancestors and the holocaust and made it seem like that was what the hate was based on.  Angelstar and I both commented on how the hatred/prejiduce is coming from actions of today, not just from years ago. Some history classes do teach events that happened a few years ago, not just a few hundred years ago. <p><b>Galuhlo</b><br><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=107606"target="new">Profile</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ujaidin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Jaidin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 135<br> <font color=#E9D756>(5/1/02 12:47:35 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3303.topic&index=91>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Racist Black People</span><hr size=1> "'Cops can be as devious and dangerous if not more than the average street thug or drug dealer.' - Angelstear<br>
<br>
Maybe that's the problem. Some people think cops are out to get them, when in reallity, they are out there to protect us." - Enbekay<br>
<br>
Im sure that the vast majority of police in the states are devoted to protecting and serving the public.  However, as Angelstear is just clearly stating the situation in his environment, obviously not all cops are trying to be heroes.  Try and see outside of what your reality covers.<br>
<br>
"'Now the attitude is developed through fear of what the other might do.' - Angelstear<br>
<br>
I agree. - Enbekay"<br>
<br>
Here you agree with Angelstear's comprehensive statement on the attitude of how varying races of people and police interact.  However, earlier you said that the reality is that police are out to protect and the problem is that people think the police are out to get them.  Angelstear's described attitude exists because your reality is not completely true, police do on occassion act both unjustly and unfairly.<br>
<br>
"'Yes i feel sorry for the cop thatwas shot and the guy that was killed BUT this SHlT happens all the time ( more than whats showed on CNN) in urban inner city areas. How do i know this? well I grew up in that type of area.' - Angelstear<br>
<br>
The fact people (black or white) are shot by cops doesn't matter. What matters is: was the shooting relevant?"<br>
<br>
The main theme of the topic is that the relevancy (wrong word here, I would have used just, detached, fair, etc) of the shooting(s) can be directly related to race.  Please do not say facts do not matter.  Some of the facts are that a white, off-duty, unidentified police officer shot a black, armed, apparently threatening civilian.  Make of the situation what you will, but please dont disregard the facts.<br>
<br>
"'If im hanging out with friends in a prodominantly white neighbor hood and something ends up stolen who do you think will be the first the cops suspect? If you think it will be the caucasians then it is my sad duty to inform you that you are an ignorant dumbass...' - Angelstear<br>
<br>
That is a bad attitude which clouds your vision of reallity."<br>
<br>
That IS Angelstear's reality.  He is describing personal experiences which have significant bearing on his position on the topic at hand.  Enbekay, you have basically said you don't believe what Angelstear has written.<br>
<br>
"'From what I have seen from milliatant black people is not hate for the white race but fear of what they can do and have done to black people in this country from its birth.' - Angelstear<br>
<br>
So, does the fact that their great-great-great-great-great-great grandfathers and mothers were slaves justify what they can/will do? They are no better than the KKK."<br>
<br>
Enbekay, you should rewrite that statement for your own well being.  Angelstear was referring to what white people can and have done to black people in this country, not what the black militants can or will do.  Historically speaking, black activists (both passive and aggressive) have banded together for totally legitimate reasons (surviving racial oppression) due to extreme aggression, unreasonable wrongdoing, and general detest done upon them by the white people of history.  The KKK...take for example a battered, tired, and abused teenager who ends up shooting his father.  Say the father is an ignorant, delusional, bigoted person who beats the child for arbitrary reasons, invites his hollow friends over to torment the child, and ends up dieing.<br>
<br>
From what you have said, the child is no better than his father. <p><img src="http://rumandmonkey.com/widgets/tests/drunk/imso.jpg" width="300" height="180"><br><a href="http://rumandmonkey.com/widgets/tests/drunk/">What kind of drunk are <i>you</i>?</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/udalamarndarkgem.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dalamarn Darkgem</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 268<br> <font color=#E9D756>(5/1/02 3:30:03 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3303.topic&index=93>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Racist Black People</span><hr size=1> So many of these posts are so out of touch with reality that it kills me.  The police ARE supposed to be there to protect and serve.  There are some bad cops.. there are some bad people everywhere.  This incident isn't a race issue.  A dumbass pulled a gun on a cop... dumbass gets shot.  End of story.  <br>
<br>
Does racism exist.  Yes it does.  It's screwed up but unfortunately it's a fact of life.  The part that really bothers me most is everyone seems to think racism=whites hating blacks.  There is so much more racism out there than that.  Why is it ok to have an American Negro College Fund... that would certainly deny any white person applying.  But if someone went out and started the American Whitey College Fund, people would raise holy hell.  As soon as they denied a person of any ethnicity other than caucasian, they would be in court so fast their heads would swim.<br>
<br>
Affirmative action, while no longer being actively pursued is also a sore point.  While it was enacted, I was TWICE passed up for jobs that I was MUCH more qualified for.  Why?  Because I was white.  I still owe thousands of dollars from student loans where I put myself through college and I get passed up for someone without college and with 3 years less experience than me because I'm caucasian.  How was this not racism?  I was passed up due to my race.<br>
<br>
If we ever manage to do away with racism (which would be a wonderful thing), it'll be with everyone being equal.  Not having different rules for other people.  Everything should be equal regardless of race, sex, sexual preference, etc.  You should hire the person that will do the best job for you.. not hire someone based on a quota.<br>
<br>
As far as the police pulling black people over more than whites, I know racial profiling does exist to a degree... but as a young white male who prefers sports cars I am constantly being pulled over.  Not speeding, not running lights, not driving erratically.. just driving nice and legally.  From some of these posts, you'd think I could run over old ladies at 100 mph and not be touched by the police.<br>
<br>
If something racist occurs, by all means.. denounce it.  But dont use racism as a copout and excuse.  If you break the law and get arrested.. it didn't happen because you're black or white.. it's because you broke the friggin law.  Also, I usually find the people that scream &quot;RACISM&quot; the loudest are among the most racist people there are.  Next time you meet someone who cries racism at every corner.. sit back and listen to what they have to say about the other races.  Talk about hypocrisy. You have to fix/help yourself before you can help others.<br>
<br>
A lot of people are going to disagree with what I say, especially since I'm a white male professional in the white collar rat race.  That's fine, everyone is entitled to their opinion.  But I WORKED to get where I am.  I went through the Marine Corps, then put myself through college, and busted ass to get where I am.  It's because I applied myself, not because I'm white.<br>
<br>
To those who think me a sheltered racist because their views dont coincide with mine, that's fine too, your opinion is just as valid as mine.  However, I do want you to know that I grew up in and around New Orleans, I KNOW how it is in the big city.  When in college, I couldn't stand the white roommate I had for a while.  Through my college career, I got two other roommates.  Both were black and both were like brothers to me.  My current best friend is a gay black guy.  As a straight professional white guy, I think that pretty much rules out me being a bigot.. at least in my own mind.. you can think whatever you like.<br>
<br>
I'd like to close by saying that nothing is going to get better till people open their hearts and minds... and stop judging everyone with their eyes. <p><a href="http://members.aol.com/wvvetteman/images/dalonhorse1.jpg" target="_blank">

She talked about the lack of rolemodels for black children being a major factor discouraging them from entering science.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> When black children see people who look like them, what do they see them doing? They see high-profile sportsmen and sportswomen, they see musicians and actors. They don't see accountants, scientists or doctors.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Doesn't that introduce the danger of tokenism?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
People said the same thing about promoting women in science. The truth is there's no perfect solution. In the US, even if the first group of black people got in as a token, the fact that they were there in sufficient numbers to have an impact meant that the next group of blacks to walk through the door were there on merit.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
If rolemodels are important, then it makes a good argument in favour of affirmative action. Sucks to be in Dalamarn's position, but if it's what is needed to &quot;break the glass ceiling&quot; or whatever, then it has merit. If this is the reason behind the policies, then they aren't needed indefinately however.<br>
<br>
What happened 300 years ago isn't the end of the problem. Here in Australia,  there are many aboriginal people who recall not even being counted as people on a census, let alone being allowed to vote. Such issues might not exist today, but I believe it would take several generations for the social and economic damage to be mitigated.<br>
<br>
Racial profiling happens. A <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.policeforum.org/racial/RBP_2.pdf">police survey</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->(pdf) shows that most police think it is not a problem. However, 40% think that it is a problem to at least some extent, and most believe that <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> the community they police</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> view it as at least some sort of problem. Toward the other end of the spectrum of viewpoints, <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.aclu.org/profiling/report/">here is an ACLU report</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->.   The &quot;truth&quot; as to how bad the problem is probably lies somewhere in the middle.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Today, blacks constitute 13 percent of the country's drug users; 37 percent of those arrested on drug charges; 55 percent of those convicted; and 74 percent of all drug offenders sentenced to prison.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
That info is lacking in data as to what the nature of the charges and convictions are, but some possible interpretations: 55% convicted to 74% imprisoned could mean that blacks are getting harsher sentancing, or that whites commit less serious crimes which don't result in prison sentances. 37% arrested to 55% convicted could mean that whites are more likely to be let off, or that they are actually more likely to be wrongly arrested. 55/37 = roughly 50% greater conviction rate for blacks who are arrested. 37/13 = almost triple the arrest rate for blacks. <p>----------------------------------<br>
