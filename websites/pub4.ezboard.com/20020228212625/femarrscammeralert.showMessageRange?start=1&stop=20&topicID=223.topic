It was really quite sad.  Here is what happened...<br><br>Nirrep's friend, Robl was doing a deal with him.  He was sitting in some fire behind Shady and &quot;couldn't move&quot; and was level 1 with no gear on.  Somehow, when you try to do a trade in the fire, your cash will fall to the ground, and he scoops it up, claiming he didn't do it.  He got 7k off Robl this way bye &quot;initiating the trade.&quot;<br><br>Here is what the fool tried to do to me...<br><br>I was auctioning to buy an Amulet of Necropetence, as I have been for a month or so, and also to buy some Barbed Ringmail Greaves (if you have greaves, send me a tell).  He sent me a tell asking how much I would pay for the greaves, and I told him 9k cash.  He then started sending me a TON of &quot;misstells&quot; about how he was telling others how much  money he had and how heavy he was.  I went to him, he said it was bye Badar or something (a merchant behind Shady) and he was sitting in the fire.  I had just heard from Nirrep what happened, so I petitioned to try to get a GM to catch him  (No GMs on.. yipee).  He then asks for me to show him the money, and I told him it was in the bank and he &quot;cant&quot; go to the bank because he weighs too much.  So, I tell him to show me the greaves first.  He tells me they are on Abudaar or something (his main) and I tell him to log him on and show me.  He then refuses to respond to tells.<br><br>About 1 minute later, I click my &quot;WTB Amulet of Necropetence&quot; button, and get a tell from him.  He says he has one and to come to him again.  He asks how much I am paying, and I say 40k... he then agrees.  I do the same thing over, and it is &quot;on his main&quot; so I am like, whatever.  Then... he asks me for 20k now, then he will log his main on.  I am not an idiot, like most of the people who get scammed, and refuse.  So, I am trying to keep him busy until a GM arrives, and I ask him how he got his AoN... This part is classic...<br><br>He gives me this loooong thing about how his &quot;main&quot; a druid went of to the plain of HATE and looted one.  I asked him something again about it and he said he got it off HATE again, LOL.  So, now I am 100% sure he is a scammer.<br><br>*side note*  AoN drops off Terror, Fright, and Dread on the plain of FEAR!<br><br>He pleads and pleads for the money and then get this... Other people start showing up and he is asking 2 others in SAY to &quot;initiate the trade&quot; and put cash in trade window first.  The two people were acquaintances of mine, a caster and Tevaran or whatever the ranger (nice Lamentation, bitch... fuck you btw... you lucky I haven't posted something about you)  I can't take this, so I send tells to the 2 and do a shout as to not do trades with him... and he logs within 5mins.<br><br>*side not* I told you what that bitch ass ranger would do, Tinvil... he always does that shit.<br><br>*side note* I later bought an AoN for 40k and it is uber!  Fear the Evil Skeleton Bard!!1!  Took me a month /sigh <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uqaldaliele666.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Qaldaliele 666</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://members.home.net/freemana/Graphics/mcpi1.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 72<br> <font color=#E9D756>(9/8/01 7:10:19 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Mulymule, don't fuck with me!</span><hr size=1> Tevaran = 1 hell of a great guy<br><br>The end of your post almost seems like a pot shot at Tev , although I may have read it wrong. <p>Qaldaliele-<BR>Mistress of Fire-<BR>Beater of Gnomes-<BR>Evoker of Mystic Coercion-<BR></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uzelgreyweather.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Zel Greyweather</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 158<br> <font color=#E9D756>(9/8/01 10:45:13 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Mulymule, don't fuck with me!</span><hr size=1> You should have offered him a STR boost from one of your songs, and to use your mini-shadow step song, too, Parum.
