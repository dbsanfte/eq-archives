These would be to the members responsible for Tormentcia's /shout &quot;Kill all pets.&quot;  My rant?  Get a clue pet casters!  I was watching.  Tormentcia was not being paranoid or anti-pet when she /shouted.  When she came down and forbade our pets she was perfectly justified because some of the pets were screwing up.  And keep reading those responsible, cuz I know of which I speak.  I am the magician who could have gotten a lot more experience points except your actions took my pet away from me, turning me into a second rate wizard.<br>
<br>
I shouldn't have to be telling people on a plane how to run a pet.  Some of you have had pets since 1st level, some from 4th.  Don't know what level shammies get theirs, but the tactics shouldn't be that much of a surprise.  But obviously you don't, so here we go.<br>
<br>
Pets break mezzes. It's very easy for them to do so.  Why do they break mezzes?<br>
<br>
1.  You sent them to the wrong target!  Yes, some of you did, I saw you.  I saw pets on bright blue lit targets, mobs that were mezzed for all of a half second until YOUR pet broke the mez.  There is only one target that is supposed to be attacked, and that's the one the MA calls.  Not the one she has targeted two seconds into the pull, the one she calls you to attack.  We have no business sending pets until the MA calls it.  We have no businesss EVER hitting 'a' or 'F8' or clicking on a mob.  All we ever need do is use our /assist hot keys.<br>
<br>
&quot;But, but…&quot; I hear you cry, &quot;She switched targets!&quot;  Wrongo.  Well, right actually, once.  She did switch it…once.  I know because my pet, like all the others, were on that mob.  That is the only time she switched after call, and that time she didn't say one word about pets.<br>
<br>
2.  You got hit.  Either from an AoE, or a mob entering the camp.  And your pet charges off after it.  Yep, it happens.  So what do you do?  You kill your pet (/pet get lost) or call it back (/pet back off, /pet as you were).  You do this before standing up (which you do anyway when attacked).  You do this before Hail %t.  You do this before you start running around trying to shake the mob off (which you aren't suppose to do anyway).  I recommend /pet get lost personally.  Malachite/bone chips aren't that expensive (if you're going to a plane raid and don't have at least 2 stacks you’re an idiot), you'll get the mana back, and you know you're pet won't be doing anything it shouldn't.<br>
<br>
3.  Something hits the pet before it got mezzed.  Easy to avoid…when the mob is about to die (less than 30% is my rule) give out a /pet back off.  This will clear its hate list instead of going, okay, that mob is dead, time to go to the next one I'm pissed off it.<br>
<br>
Every caster on that raid was level 47 or higher.  I shouldn't be having to tell you how to play your class.  On the other hand, a level 47+ caster yesterday (actually more than one) didn't know these things.  This isn't rocket science and for non-shamans stuff you should have learned in your teens when you first started working with mezzes.  You are the people who make pets hated, and you are the ones that made me a second rate wizard yesterday instead of the competent magician that I am.  So please, read this, learn it, live it!  Pets are stupid.  We all know this.  Don't be as stupid as they are.<br>

<br>
I try not to use pets on vital raids as much as possible. Though I consider myself a good pet master, I have had my moments. (in SolB...umm where did my pet go -WIPEOUT!-)<br>
<br>
On plane raids, I only use the pet on boss mobs that don't fear. On regular raids, it depends on the circumstances. If we are moving a lot, no pet...stationary for a long period of time...I usually cast an air pet. I try to have invis memmed up just in case...and am fast to type /pet get lost.<br>
<br>
Raids have a goal...to succeed...they are not pissing/KS'ing contests to see which group gets the exp and to see who does the most damage. Yes, a pet class might feel vulnerable without Lokan/Vontik/Jenab, but the whole raid party will be safer without them unless called upon...so us pet classes need to sacrifice a bit.<br>

<br>
Other side note...i had mezed several times an imp.....shouted it, ooced it that an enchi should take mez over.....nope my mez werent take over. I dont have stuns or such a fast casting mez as enchis have, i cant lower resists to make sure my mez wont get resisted....and most of plane lvl mobs dont work the mem blure on the scream terror.<br>

Oh and dont go to a plane raid when ya expect to get exp in there....go to velk...nice drops and surly more exp than on a plane raid.<br>

 I apologize if I step on anyone's toes, but I'll bitch up a storm before I'll die to a stupid pet on the planes. I'll damn sure bitch up a storm before I'll let base camp be taken out because of me getting killed due to a pet. I've had to mez while I've had a charmed pet in the village of Velketor's, and if I can control a pet while charming and mezzing, then anyone can do it. I'm normally fairly easy going, but pets is one thing I've decided to put my foot down about.<br>

As far as I could see, your pet was not the troublemaker.  The tanks and enchanters can correct me if I'm wrong, but it looked to me like the problem was with shaman and mage pets.<br>
<br>
As for the mez thing, I don't think that the rest of us understood what you were doing.  Cut us some slack here -- a lot of people don't understand how necromancer spells work.  Next time, just wait for a break in the action, then type something like &quot;/ooc I'm using a necromancer spell to mez some of the mobs when we get swarmed, but I'll need an enchanter to take over the mez because mine doesn't last long.&quot;  If we'd understood what you were doing, there would have been no problem.  I'm sure you'll agree that a lot of people are ignorant when it comes to the capabilities of necromancers.<br>
<br>
Anyway, it was nice having you along on the raid.  We're sorry that you felt slighted.<br>
<br>
Oh, and Airaman was definitely not on this raid.  We had a solid group of mages, shamans, and necros, but things just kept getting fouled up.  I like to let pet classes use their pets on raids, but this time we were just having too many problems.  Even without the pets, we cleared the plane with no serious problems. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/usharasalishadowsoul.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sharasali Shadowsoul</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 711<br> <font color=#E9D756>(10/15/01 8:35:09 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Pet Classes:  Get a Clue!</span><hr size=1> Now I have no problem with the flame itself, just the reasons behind it...<br>

What I took from it was not that Salenie was totally bent about NOT getting exp, but more the fact that people need to learn to control their pets.  <br>
<br>
She was punished by having to kill her pet because other people that were on a plane raid (If you are sufficient level to go to the planes, you should know how to control a pet) were not babysitting their own.  This can cause death, annoyance and over all a really rotten raid.  <br>
<br>
As for the spectre pet costing a peridot...When you know that the chances are really high that you might have to /kill your pet...I wouldn't use such a pricey one.  Go with a less expensive pet.  I wonder if that will be the person hollering that they spent a whole stack of peridots on the raid or the one that people are mad at because their pet broke the mezzes.<br>

One of the biggest flaws in even the best raids I've seen has been mesmerization order. &nbsp;If there is a multi-pull that brings in dispelling MOBs, those are the ones I fully intend to focus on mesmerizing. &nbsp;I can sit and mez the other MOBs all day long, but those dispellers will keep breaking... and breaking... and breaking my mezzes. &nbsp;If they are mesmerized, the non-dispelling MOBs can't do a thing to break them out and are thus much easier to take down with minimal buff/life loss. &nbsp;Once just the dispellers remain, chain stunning is more reliable since juggling mezzes alongside them won't be a problem. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uraelven.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Raelven</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 587<br> <font color=#E9D756>(10/16/01 7:00:20 am)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Pet Classes:  Get a Clue!</span><hr size=1> Raelven tells the guild "Hey one of you shammys shrink my Amy Warrior!"<br>

I hate to break the troubling news to you.  But one of the only reason that I go on planes raids anymore is to GET exp.  Bottom line:  Someone's got to get it.  The key is to not die doing it.  I've gotten pretty damn good at not getting myself killed and getting a LOT of exp on a raid.  You just have to know what you're doing.  Sure sure, it might be a bit easier for me as a Wizard, but a couple of mages can give me a run for my money with pets up.<br>
<br>
Why exp?  Because it's fun to do damnit.  For those of you who advocate "NO EXP ON RAIDS, BLAH BLAH".  well, guess you've never been in a KS group.  I can tell you that every member of my group was having a blast, and that's what this game is about.  Just the effort to get exp on a raid is so much fun.<br>
<br>
So, dont go yelling that crap, cause someone's got to get the exp one way or another.<br>
<br>
<br>
And about pets:  My pet wasnt able to be there on this raid, but usually she's very on top of things.  A wizard couldn't ask for a better pet than Vishanti.<br>

If and when you are allowed to use pets, on a multiple pull do not send in any pets to assist untill ALL mobs are mezzed.  If three mobs come in, if you assist on the correct one and send pet in prior to any mezzes landing, chances are one of the 'wrong' mobs will hit your pet before mez lands, which causes pet to reassign to the wrong mob.  This wrong mob cant get mezzed now and you will have to kill your pet.  I can't agree with Salene enough on the /pet back off comment to clear pets aggro list, I see to many (mostly shammy and druid <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ) pets break a mez as soon as their primary target dies causing the mob to wail on the enc because no tanks had time to taunt...<br>
<br>
I have never been guilty of doing any of this <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Seriously, bad pet management ruins the reputation of all pet classes.  Some people can handle their pets, some can't. <p>Athao Zarr
