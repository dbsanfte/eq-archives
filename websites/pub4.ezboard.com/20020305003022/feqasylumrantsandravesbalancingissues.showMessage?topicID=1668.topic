Maybe you'll actually learn something.<br><br>I realized the only connection I have to the people on this mssg board is that at one time I played a game that I now hate, and they may or may not be currently be playing it. So why am I here? Well, I thought that since I played this game for a while, I'd have some common interests with people that played on the same server as me.<br><br>All I can say is, if I met some of the people on these boards during my time playing, I would have quit EQ a lot earlier then I did.<br><br>So, I'm not going to hold this up any longer, I'm not going to hold anything back. If any of these sound like you or someone you know, chances are thats the target.<br><br>I'm sick of all you holier-the-thou posters that think because you stay civil and don't use any derogatory speech when you pick apart posts, and think this puts you on higher ground then the people your arguing with, it doesn't. <br><br>I detest you jackasses that act like they're really open-minded, but in truth, they're just another prick on the boards that has to accept everything and only has the balls to condemn something when they know they have people that have got their backs, because they fear being put on the spot if someone gets offended at them. <br><br>For the people that actually post things just so that people will agree with them, I hope that little rush gets you through life, because its obvious you don't have much more. <br><br>People that actually insult people with things like being shut-ins or having no life? You play eq, thats the pot calling the kettle black.<br><br>All you people that consider "thnx la~ drive thru" to be an actual insult, from a "talent in writing" sense, you would be Carrot-top's bitch.<br><br>For you people that respond only to what you want in a post while ignoring the rest, I hope you do that with the road, and ignore the oncoming cars.<br><br>People that cant spell worth shit or don't use punctuation, your flaw gets enough attention as it is.<br><br>For the hypocrites that say that insult people be accusing them of doing these things, then turn around and do that on the next thread, Don't worry, your not alone.<br><br>Finally, for the fuckers that are just waiting to find a post that could be considered contriversial so that they can tear it apart and show someone how their opinion is so wrong and make them feel bad for having the balls to actually post what they think and feel, do the decent people here a favor, and leave. You won't be missed.<br><br>I came to these boards a few months ago, trying to be humorous. It worked out ok, but over time, the more I freely expressed myself, the more I became the target of attacks. This became a vicious downward spiral of assaults and rebuttals, and, well, it's led to this. Over time the taint of competition and augment slowly augmented me. I have to leave, so I wont be a part of this negative cycle any longer.<br><br>To all my RL friends, my time is up here, but we really don't need this do we?<br><br>To the admins, epically Tarot, you do a good job of keeping this place in line. I respect that, because I would never have the patience to babysit so may people, let alone add intelligent replies to many of the topics. Heh, guess its one less person to watch over.<br><br>To anyone that actually enjoyed anything I ever posted, thanks for your support, I actually got a kick out of alot of that stuff as well.<br><br>I guess thats everything. Know before posting here, that after I post this, I won't be coming back. You can beat the dead horse all you want, it means nothing to me. Its too bad that it had to end this way, but it had to end eventually. So long.<br><br><i>"Let us depart.

Sorry if some of it's not sugar coated...hopefully you know me well enough from the boards to know none of it's intended to be mean.<br><br>When you first showed up on the boards...at least I think that's when you first showed up, first post I remember seeing was one of &quot;I'm better than you all neener neener&quot; a <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> very</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> baiting post.<br><br>Caught my eye, because I was concerned about dousing flames. People however took it in good humor. Honestly I think you <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> may</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> have seriously come to the boards to bait...and got hooked in yourself because Lanys is both addictive and interesting.<br><br>It's also an incredibly diverse community. We have lots of different folk here, with many different opinions. Some I agree with, some I don't. Most are reasonably thought out and intellegent...some um are not.<br><br>There's a ton of discussions I don't even get involved in, not because I don't think they're interesting, but because it would require too much of my time to participate in them. People on the boards on discussions will call you on shit. And you'd best be prepared to defend/explain your position. It's in some cases like a debate. So sometimes I don't have the time or energy to devote to participating in that in certain threads. Sometimes they become so interesting that I'll jump in on later pages because I can no longer help myself.<br><br>You made a statement on another thread. Perhaps that wasn't how you intended it to be taken. Doesn't matter. You made a statement. People disagreed with you, and the thread went off track. <br><br>Now, I have personally picked the <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> shit</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> out of some people's posts on occasion. To the point where some people post &quot;Gee, don't ever piss Tarot off&quot;. Which when stated I tend to find kinda funny and kinda scary. When I pick the shit out of someone's posts, I'm generally doing so for a very specific purpose. I'm dismantling what they're saying. If they want to respond, they can pick apart mine, but they're gonna have to <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> think</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> to do it.<br><br>And hopefully in the end, we'll not only be entertained, but maybe even learn something.<br><br>Some people are brutal in how they do that though. And some people, let's be honest, are real assholes on this board. So? The people who are pricks, I certainly don't value their opinion. And in not valuing their opinion, I don't really care what they have to say. To me it has no merit. Sure, if they attacked me I may or may not call them on it, but since I don't give a damn what they think, it's not like it bothers me personally.<br><br>Beyond the bullshit, and crap, and humor...did you LEARN anything from that thread? Did you see anything you hadn't seen before? Did it cause you to evaluate how you state things, or perhaps even how you might think about things? Did you see another person's perspective you weren't aware of?<br><br>Uncomfortable? Sure. Sometimes it is.<br><br>But if you GAINED anything from it, then what immense value it has.<br><br>Believe me, there have been times when I've seen some things on this board I've been an inch away from leaving this board for good. Basically because of a couple of people. I've gone so far at one point to tell Leolan I'm done with it, and attempted to quit. The bastard wouldn't let me. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br>And in the position I'm in, I could have easily banned that person over the situation I found so personally abhorant. I have the power to do so, and frankly could have <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> easily</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> done it...even probably with a lot of support from the community.<br><br>I didn't though. Mainly because as shitty as I found it, and as easily as it would have been to ban them, I don't like to ban people. Everyone makes up this community, not just the people I don't like. However we've tried to develop more rules to make the majority more comfortable while infringing on the least amount of people. Hopefully that works as well as anything can.<br><br>My entire point here is, that there are things about this community I don't like, and threads I've seen that make me frankly want to puke. However for the most part I do like it. If I gain a perspective on an issue, or am forced to think or rethink anything...I've gained a great deal.<br><br>That's what I get from the community, besides being amused. Besides news and gossip. Besides EQ by proxy. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I sometimes gain enlightenment. And that's why I'm still around.<br><br>I'd urge to you take a step back, take a deep breath and ask yourself why do you want to leave. And what you get out of posting. If you're pissy because your pride is hurt, or your feelings got hurt, take a look at why. <br><br>I think you do get something from Lanys. I really do. I also think you contribute to Lanys as well.<br><br> And I think that perhaps why you're leaving is wrong for you. I hope you rethink it in any case. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><a href="http://www.anarchyboard.com" target="_blank"><img src="http://users.gloryroad.net/~arathorn/Tarotsign.jpg" border="0"></a> <br><FONT COLOR=000000 SIZE=1>Realm </FONT><FONT COLOR=FF0000 SIZE=1>RETIRED</FONT><BR><FONT COLOR=000000 SIZE=1>Everquest: Fennin Ro, Karana, Ero Marr & Lanys T'Vyl </FONT><FONT COLOR=FF0000 SIZE=1>RETIRED</FONT><BR><FONT COLOR=000000 SIZE=1>Ultima Online: Catskills </FONT><FONT COLOR=FF0000 SIZE=1>INACTIVE</FONT><BR><FONT COLOR=000000 SIZE=1>Anarchy Online: Beta Tester, Rubi-Ka 1 </FONT><FONT COLOR=FF0000 SIZE=1>RETIRED</FONT><BR><FONT COLOR=000000 SIZE=1>Dark Age of Camelot: Beta Tester;Merlin Midgard</FONT><FONT COLOR=008000 SIZE=1> CURRENT</FONT></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/usnarky00.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Snarky00</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Cyber Pimp</span><br> <font color=#000033>(2/7/02 12:12:16 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumrantsandravesbalancingissues.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1668.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.glitchless.com/root/sunset.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: My Final Rant.</span><hr size=1> Tarot you make the assumption that because some people dont write down their whole thought process and explain it in detail they didnt have one =P<br><br>Beleive me most of my posts are the 'short and sweet' kind but that doesnt mean i didnt spend a while thinking of what i was going to say. maybe i just didnt want to take the time to type something out when i know its not *really* important i just want to share my opinion<br><br>Anyway sorry to see anyone leave, for the most part everyone on Lanys.com is a good person, some of them are just opinionated...like me <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/utarotoflanys.showPublicProfile?language=EN>TarotofLanys</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.nyanna.f2s.com/icons10/butterfly1b.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle><FONT COLOR=AA0000><B>Moderator Pirate</B></FONT></span><br> <font color=#000033>(2/7/02 5:02:58 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumrantsandravesbalancingissues.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1668.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://users.gloryroad.net/~arathorn/butterfly.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: My Final Rant.</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Tarot you make the assumption that because some people dont write down their whole thought process and explain it in detail they didnt have one =P<br><br><hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br><br>Not to hijack Azuza's rant here or anything, but where the hell did you get that idea from?

You seem to get quite upset when people dont agree with you. There are people on this board I dont agree with on more than a few issues, BUT I think they are good people from what I can see here and I find much of what they have to say intelligent and thought out even if I dont agree. To give an example of this, Harabac (darkomen). I find that I disagree with him on a few issues and others I agree. BUT no matter if I agree or disagree dosent change the fact that from what I see on this board he is a good guy. I dont know him in RL, so judging by what I see on this board only, I have respect for him. <br><br>To me people dont agree on everything, they exchange their thoughts and maybe you change your view on somthing, or maybe it strengthens what you already feel. For me personally, a person dosent have to agree with me and think as I do for me to respect and like them. People who dont agree with me are not automatically stupid idiots in my book. It dosent make them uniformed or any of the other things you have posted in response to me.<br><br>I like to hear what people think. Thats me. I post what I think. If someone is not interested in my thoughts they can skip all my posts. I am not forcing anyone to read what I think or feel. They can scroll on by.<br><br>You said to me in your other post on the furry thread that I think I am above you. No, that is your assumption of what I think. I have no more, no less value than anyone here. I am one person with opinions like everyone else. I think you would be happier if I just called names and flamed endlessly. Since I dont do that you think I am taking some high and mighty approach? No I just dont think someone who disagrees with my views deserves to be flamed or called names. I think they have a right to feel as they do, say what they wish without being called names by me.<br><br>If it really upsets you so much to have people disagree with you then maybe this forum isnt good for you. It is a diverse community, and people will disagree. Things have been said on this board that changed my view on some issues, things have been said on this board that I didnt know about, which means I learned somthing. <br><br>There are people on this board who agree with you and like what you have to say, some dont. /shrug. If you cant handle that, then it is your choice to stop ranting or become a &quot;casual poster&quot; and definitely a good idea for you to scroll by my posts. I wont lose sleep over that. <p><center><img src="http://www.danos.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/jellah.gif" width="577" height="162"></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ubrambler.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Brambler</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www-unix.oit.umass.edu/~damiene/3dlgowu2.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I live here.... get out.</span><br> <font color=#000033>(2/7/02 11:11:28 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumrantsandravesbalancingissues.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1668.topic&index=9>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www-unix.oit.umass.edu/~damiene/leaf.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: My Final Rant.</span><hr size=1> Yup Azuza, we all need to start using derogatory speech and never remain civil in debates, and we all secretly hate gays, lesbians, and anything else beyond what you define as norms, we just don't have the balls to admit it.  <br><br>/boggle <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ulittlecherub.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Little Cherub</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I live here.... get out.</span><br> <font color=#000033>(2/7/02 11:14:03 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumrantsandravesbalancingissues.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1668.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: My Final Rant.</span><hr size=1> L8r <p><TABLE BORDER="0" CELLSPACING="0" CELLPADDING="4" width="600" align="CENTER"><TR><TD width="80"><img src="http://students.cs.byu.edu/~trentdm/minicherub.gif" ALT="That's me! /swoooon!"></TD><TD><FONT Face="Arial" size="-1"><b><span title="My current profile."><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=8276" target="_blank">Cherub DwarvenAngel</a></span><span title="Drop me a line.

I really despise some of the people on these boards too, but I get a kick out of some of the discussions, and then it lures me to post. Some of you have no idea how annoying you can be, and it has nothing to do with agreement. The sarcastic undertones, the condescending attitudes (admit it), the egos some of you have, the CONSTANT quoting, the misinterpretations, misunderstandings, etc. If you want to insult him, go ahead, you're only proving his point.  <p><BR>Eladamri Oakensoul <BR>51 Druid of Lanys T'Vyl <BR>Retired<BR></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/umacoy.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Macoy</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>h0x0r!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(2/7/02 4:39:16 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumrantsandravesbalancingissues.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1668.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: My Final Rant.</span><hr size=1>  Why bother telling people you are leaving and never coming back??
