This is a way for a person who kills HG's for a few weeks to use thier plats to obtain something they would otherwise have nil chance of getting. ever!<br>
Think of it as a service to the general population of the server, they are passing down loot they have no or little use for to everyone else. <br>
Now if these items were to apear on E-Bay or were being sold for real cash as opposed to monopoly money that would be a different story, but this is all being kept in-game.<br>

Just want to bring to attention my situation, however, and I think one that is somewhat shared by most:<br>
<br>
I don't have, and will NEVER have 50kpp sitting around. Why? <br>
<br>
One reason: I spend it to help my guildmembers advance their characters. <br>
<br>
Second reason: Despite Verant's attempt to make hybrids more group friendly, and I praise them for Strength of Nature as a spell, the old Ranger falacy as I see it still holds: If you want to camp anything of reasonable size, get a guild that will take you.  I don't mean to bitch, because I unfortunately totally understand why people simply don't want a ranger in group: manasink unless they have incredible armor, a druid can snare just like a ranger, and a monk can do more damage and pull better, among other reasons.  I will be the first to admit that the instant way to put a group in trouble is to have two rangers in it: You can't say that about ANY other class. <br>
<br>
That being said, and my main character being a Ranger, I will have little chance of getting the cashflow to finance my epic, and this situation is made worse by having people two levels lower than me walking around with both epics.  Being a ranger can be a very competitive business, especialy because we aren't really ever needed.  This is the same issue that used to and still continues to exist with Rangers and planar armor.  I didn't choose to join a large guild that already did planar raids, and Rangers aren't needed in the planes, so at level 54 I have a whole two pieces of Thorny Vine.  I HAVE bought a Tolan's Helm, and a guildie gave me Gaunts, but the fact of the matter is that I basically spent all of my money on that Helm, and my TV Pieces are from two raids, one where I came up to specifically loot TTs because there were no rangers and one was in Hate, where they were desperate for extra bodies and a friend had weaseled me in.  <br>
<br>
It's no way to really exist imo, so I DID start building my own guild to do such things, and I'm proud to say that we're doing Hate on saturday and did Fear last weekend with the help of Phoenix Crusaders.  I guess my point is, selling epic pieces hurts those without the cash.  Now, instead of having a friend to get you into a Fear raid, you have to PAY to get a friend to chain a quest.  Anyway, I'm sure most of you will just say that's the way the game goes, and I'd have to agree, so oh well. Just thought I'd stand up for what is probably a majority of the rangers on server :/<br>

If I am misinterpreting - then my apologies.  A few clarifications on my part: <br>
<br>
I didn't pay 50kp<br>
<br>
I do help my guildmembers<br>
<br>
I won a swarmcaller in Karnors PICKUP group (ie: plat)<br>
<br>
I have ONE piece of TV armor<br>
<br>
I was given my Tolans helm by a friend who quit eq (/wave Deroekeloze)<br>
<br>
I won the Treeweave I am wearing<br>
<br>
I am wearing "handmedown" rygorr legs from a ranger in our guild that won TV legs<br>
<br>
I hate to say it - 'cos I avoid it like the plague - but pharm Hill Giants for plat or Sea Furies for gems - buy a good item at a great price (it HAPPENS) and then start churning the cashflow in EC for a few nights - buy low - sell high - sure it sucks - but it works.<br>
<br>
I FREQUENTLY am in guild groups with TWO rangers in them and we actually live (level 52's - maybe it's different at 54)<br>
<br>
I didn't really now any Da`Kor peeps from Adam when I approached them about the stone - they were very nice and helpful and it worked out.  I have just as many "connections" in this game as you do I'm guessing.    <br>
<br>
I won the Emerald on a guild raid to Hate (as the ONLY ranger there btw) - my guild did the Hole for Jaelil - my guild did CoM (I ended up buying a jade reaver 'cos I never did win one there when they did drop) - I am going as a guest on a Sky raid (though we are capable of it - it's an awful lot of plat for a full raid for one piece of loot needed for my epic) <br>
<br>
Getting your epics is not a race against every other ranger on the server - just because someone lower level than you has them - it means nothing.  How does my having epics affect YOUR ability to get them?  I've been in about 2 pickup groups in the past year playing this game - I'm pretty sure you won't be competing with me for a spot in any of them.    <br>

This is a very good attitude to have but you have to make the choice on whther your gonna help people or help yourself, after all you cant have your cake and eat it too. I think people are missing the point that these are epic weapons and not everyone is meant ot have em. These guilds selling the epic quest items are in fact helping people who would never have a chance to get these items with their own guild, to have a shot at obtaining them. Sure the prices are expensive, but why shouldnt they be? Look at the effort involved in obtaining them. The bottom line is if you cant afford to buy the epic items then thats something you have to deal with its no reason to frown upon the guilds that are selling the items.<br>

btw, I doubt anyone would consider farmining uber mobs for plat fun anyways. The only *fun* thing about killing these mobs over and over is so friends can get better equip and epics.  No one is gonna spend 6 hours in PoF just to sell a cazic skin, for example. <p>tuan {cupcakes}<br>

And I agree, epic weapons weren't meant for everyone, but I don't think "epic" was the correct terminology for what these weapons are.  Epic has the connotation of a long, drawn out process, that may involve a culminatint event(s) needed to complete it. What these weapons are, and have become, is another status symbol, possible to be achieved by only the largest and highest level guilds on any server.  I would personally rather someone spend months working on an epic item, doing quest after quest for this, that and the other to THEN be rewarded for his diligence, not for being able to get 30 of his closest friends online to help him kill X Uber Mob. <br>
<br>
Anyway, those points aside, Oj, I'm actually glad that you're getting your epic, and I didn't imply that you didn't do everything that a good guild member and ranger does.  You were simply an example of how I think power works in this game, and it all comes down to pp and connections.  This is not directed towards you or anyone in particular: It's politics, not a game.  I think that this need to play politics hits a ranger harder than most classes, and while I do agree having a group with two rangers can theoretically work, I'd like to see any group in Sebilis willingly take two rangers except at last resort.  Your ability to get groups together with friends and not have to resort to pick-up groups is admirable, but while my guild has finally gotten to the point where I can do this on a regular basis, I've gone 54 levels of having to get my own, and it isn't pretty usually.  <br>
<br>
BTW Oj, the reason I'm glad you're getting your epic is so that I can actually see someone without the <Uberguild X> tag over there head with epics in hand.  And this is NOT a flame against the bigger guilds of Emarr, I honestly have no quarrel with any of them and they've all helped me at one point or another with a random rez or group, and I don't blame them for selling for guild funds.<br>

The stones thing is just an offset of the fact that we're already killing him and don't need the stones for our own epics. We, like any guild who raids, have guild expenses. Stones and other such items are sold for the guild fund. This really is no different then selling any other weapon or item. We obtained it, we can sell it. I've seen lots of guilds sell belts from PoF for guild funds. Imagine you're not in a guild who can clear PoF. It's the same principle. If anything, we're giving some classes a bit more of a chance in obtaining their epics. Only 3 guilds on server who regularly kill VS, so basically if you're a druid or ranger who isn't in one of those guilds you're shit outta luck on your epic unless you can find a way to get that stone. Just makes sense to me.<br>

No, you have to pay the friends GUILD to chain a quest. I have one of these VS stones on me, but it's not my stone, it's my guilds. If the whole guild has you as a friend I'd say your chance of getting it for free would be pretty high.

If you could obtain your epic by questing around for a month - then most uber guilds could probably have all their chars equipped with epics in a couple days ....<br>
<br>
<br>
it makes sense that stuff 30 people can get, 6 person groups can not ....<br>
<br>
the word is epic, not something you can get with one group. You'll need a large group of friends - or guilds to help you do &quot;epic&quot; stuff. wouldn't make sense making an &quot;epic&quot; quest and make it doable by 1-6 people.<br>
<br>
As they stated &quot;epics are not for everybody&quot; (well maybe it wasn't worded like that, but it was something like it)<br>
<br>
Maybe set some goals up. <br>
<br>
get lvl 60<br>
start raiding with friends, get to know eachother<br>
get gear that'll make killing those  mobs easier etc etc<br>
<br>
it is not the &quot;guild&quot; that kills it - it is the people IN the guild. No reason you can't kill big mobs without being in a guild ... well you need the chat channel <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
and no i don't have my epic :P<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
btw ... you don't need a guild to get groups in OS<br>
<br>
when i was unguilded i had no problems at all getting groups (well unless there was 13 people in the zone and i was only solo ... ) Its about playing well, acting friendly, know your class etc etc. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ucaladdor.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Caladdor</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 183<br> <font color=#E9D756>(2/10/01 3:29:59 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Selling Epics?</span><hr size=1> Oh and with the current drop rate/pop rate on VS i doubt any guilds will be pharming him just for stones to sell ever. <br>

Either people will quit before. They will just stop doing him cause they're busy in sov and so on<br>
