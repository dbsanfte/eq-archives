<br>
But my stance about levels is this. I created my character back in 99. Alot of people nowadays that aren't already uber but are 60 are people that bitch about having 60 days on their character and that started postRoK. <br>
<br>
Now I said alot, so the 3 or 4 of you that will say you fall into this category will fall into this category.<br>
<br>
But I have over 114 playing days to my level 55 wizard. I have put a shit load of alot of time into my character, and I have died alot, got into sucky exp groups, and post 50 gotten hardly any groups. And if I have it's just as an extra hand cause they don't need anymore ench's tank's or healers.<br>
<br>
I felt*felt, cause I am not going to continue this game in a month.* That I needed my epic because of the effort and time I put into this game. But in my old guild it was set up that levels were what determined who got their epic first. Low and behold someone I twinked up when they were little was in front of me. He didn't play longer, he just got lucky. While I would be lfg in OS or attempting to kite raptors and dying because I was on a dail up slow ass modem.<br>
<br>
I believe I had just as much a right to a epic that he did, but did I argue? Nope. <br>
<br>
I just left. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uaauan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aauan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 66<br> <font color=#E9D756>(12/16/01 2:51:54 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I have a bitch about loot rules</span><hr size=1> i agree with Cao, although i feel i'm in a better situtation to sya that people who stay 52 are only hurting themselves and thier guild. while Cao has the option for a ND, i don't. i killed naggy and vox a few times, never even seen my books drop. i was already hitting the 52 cap and it came time to either level, or stay 52. being lvl 52 sucks bad, so i leveled. i've never regretted it once. i look at how god awful the pally epic is, the ratio is horrible, any pally 59+ can use the 2 handed bash skill if they choose. it only has 15 ac, decent resists, but thats easy to offset. and the proc is a joke. but it's a status symbol, if thats what people go for fine, but complaining about being 52, thats totally your choice.<br>
<br>
bards got it bad, but with every patch they break bards, with ever expansion they screw bards up more, do you expect anything else? the easy option, would be to make a triggered naggy and vox, make them drop a scale, a book each respectively. hell druids and rangers get it, why the crap can't we?<br>

<br>
Like it or not, the old world dragons have become somewhat of a rite of passage.  People want to go do those raids.  There are people who hit 45 and think to themselves &quot;I can make a Naggy/Vox roster now!&quot;, and it's their reward for 45 levels of play to be able to do a multigroup raid.  A lot of these folks are not the twinks of higher level players, they grew up in a small guild or no guild at all, watching, playing, and levelling.<br>
<br>
By the time they hit 50+, they are by then more seasoned at these raids.  Seems fair to me that their chance for loot comes around with it.<br>
<br>
Nobody that I know of wants to stay farming Nagafen and Vox for epic items.<br>
<br>
Which brings me to my point.  There is a cycle that goes through them.  Nagafen and Vox are like the gateways of the pick-up community, where everyone can participate in a raid of this scope.<br>
<br>
They join, they do their time.  Their raid leaders level up.  And they become leaders or experienced hands themselves.<br>
<br>
It's been a healthy cycle, all things considered.<br>
<br>
That said, the 50+ limit for epic loot makes sense.<br>
<br>
Once upon a time, Crombattleaxe was 45.  He went on a dragon raid.  He learned from some folks.  He led some raids.  When it was his time, he won his book and he moved on.<br>
<br>
Once upon a time, Brecht was 45.  He went on a dragon raid.  He learned from some folks.  He led some raids.  When it was his time, he won his scale and he moved on.<br>
<br>
Once upon a time, Kerna was 45.  He went on a dragon raid.  He learned from some folks.  He led some raids.  When it was his time, he won his book and moved on.<br>
<br>
Once upon a time, Jexielia was 45.  She went on a dragon raid.  She learned from some folks.  She led some raids.  When it was her time, she moved on.<br>
<br>
Get the picture?  Like it or not (and if you are debating this, I daresay not), folks go through this cycle.  It's not a bad thing.  People benefit from this.  The old world dragons have a level cap, the higher guilds are way past it.  It is the doorway for the younger up-and-coming people.<br>
<br>
And that said, the level restrictions on loot help preserve the cycle.  And in my own opinion, it is worth preserving.<br>
<br>
Finally, if you think it's unfair, too slow, you've got better things to do with your time, you're impatient, you'd rather go farm cash and buy the chainquesting rights of the item, you don't want to submit yourself to &quot;the cycle&quot; (which has in practice been adopted by the server at large), then put together your own raid and your own rules.<br>
<br>
Don't you see?  The lower level people submit themselves to the cycle willingly.  That's why they go.  They attend, they learn, they lead (or coach), and they move on.  And in the lower levels, they know up front that they will not get a shot at the epic loot.  But they still go.<br>
<br>
Those of you who complain about the level restriction on loot are the ones who don't want to submit to the server-adopted process.  You are the ones who don't want to &quot;do your time&quot;.<br>
<br>
It's an FFA game, do as you will.  Anyone with enough friends and firepower can muster a raid and call the dragon and move on it.<br>
<br>
Most level 45 people (who are not RL friends, boyfriends, girlfriends, or twinks of uberguilds) can't.  That's why &quot;the cycle&quot; works.  And it is also why it is effective.<br>
<br>
And so, grandstanding on behalf of the &quot;poor downtrodden loot-cheated level 45-49 people&quot; seems rather silly and ineffective to me.  These are pick-up raids!  Your idea of what is fair doesn't really matter!  A pick-up dragon raid leader receives their authority from the people they lead.  If their loot rules were not in accordance with what the majority thought was proper, they wouldn't get the people together to do the raid!  Naggy/Vox raids fail because of this all the time.  Non-attendance == failed raid.<br>
<br>
Listen to me carefully.  In pick-up raids, majority &gt; you.<br>
<br>
The majority thinks it's fair, ergo the leader posts the rules, the leader gets the muster together (because enough people agree), they succeed on the raid, and the cycle moves on.<br>
<br>
If you want different rules, lead the raid (or get someone to do it).  If everyone thinks it's fair, they'll go, you will succeed, hooray for you!<br>
<br>
From what I see, the rest is just complaining.<br>
<br>
There you go, that's my 2cp.<br>

2. It boosts singing songs (ones that require no instrument) by 80%. This is how bards can help provide those really insane damage shields. It is also how they can provide straight attack rating boosts. Without it, these aspects are mediocre at best.<br>
3. It procs a groupwide attack boost as well as haste that lasts for a good chunk of time.<br>
<br>
If you doubt my opinion, go ask Thott(guildleader of Afterlife). Go ask one of the bards from FoH. Go ask bards in any of the big guilds that do endgame mobs. They will all tell you that it could be a weapon on par with a rusty dagger and they would still wield it due to the effects above. Can you play a high-level bard without your epic? Yes. Are you truly effective at high-level without it? No. Our epic, unlike many of the others, is not just a status symbol. It completes our class at the high end. Without it you are relegated to providing manasong and mediocre buffs until level 60, when you get a disc that provide similiar capability for 2 min and then a nice long recycle time.<br>
<br>
I am not coming down on you per se, you are entitled to your opinion. But until you have experience playing a high level bard you can't claim to have knowledge that the bard epic is not necessary to be all you can be. If you have the experience of playing a high level bard, you simply realize that the epic adds signifigantly to your class. It's not just &quot;another weapon&quot;.  <p><small><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Celdor Dreamweaver - Bard (EQ)<br><a href="http://members.home.net/mahkt/"><b>Midnight Fury</b></a><br><br><i>"Let me tell you something pendejo, you pull any of your crazy shit with us, you flash your piece out on the lanes, I'll take it away from you and stick it up your ass and pull the fucking trigger 'till it goes click...Nobody fucks with the Jesus."</i>
