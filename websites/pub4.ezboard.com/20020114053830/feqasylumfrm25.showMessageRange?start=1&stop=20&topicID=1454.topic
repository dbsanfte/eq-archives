Thank you VITA for being the driving force of the raid - as you were the ones that gave me the hope to keep calling peeps. I believe this makes 2 times in one week that you have taken Ragefire! WOOT GO VITA!<br>
<br>
In addition - Thank you Momento Mori, I have some very close friends in this guild - Tharsonious and Freyda, Thank You for gathering your peeps.<br>
<br>
Honestly, since I am without a guild family, I thought that it would be quite sometime before i had the opportunity to take Ragefire. I just called upon my friends and everyone came running - along with their friends. I think there was like 40 plus peeps on the raid and u all got there so fast!<br>
<br>
I turned in all my components and YES - Helina is now Epic!! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
And it looks freakin SWEET! I cant wait to use that 56th Lvl rez w/o watching my mana bar be drained! WOOOHOOO!<br>
<br>
This was a spur of the moment raid as anyone that has done Ragefire knows that is usually how it goes. Although very chaotic (especially in the beginning) EACH and EVERYONE of you did a freaking awesome job!!!!!<br>
<br>
I would like to say that I was slightly disappointed of my fellow Cleric support - With the exception of those that offered me awesome advise and Manpower throughout my epic quest and further advise during Ragefire (you know who you are - Elmedico, Ceeb, Cherub, and Simc). WOOOHOOO Thank You! Altogether 4 Clerics were gathered at the beginning of the raid. And this was like pulling teeth. By the time we got to the Ramp where the Fire Giants were - there was only two Clerics, Myself Lvl 54 and a sweet young Cleric name Denvil Lvl 46, who stuck it out thru the entire thing! I would like to give many thanks to Denvil - and when you are ready for yours little guy - You Better Call me! I will come running! With this in mind though you know what - WHO IN THE HELL EVER SAID DRUIDS COULDNT HEAL?!??! I think we had 5 druids. Hahahaha!! Druids R0x0rs! We had a couple shammys there also - Thank u buffs Babes!<br>
<br>
We did have an unfortunate surprise when the Dragon was down - as Vladamir was collecting loot calls on a Blazing BP and Boots, the large Dragon disappeared - poofed. Being that it was an epic mob many including I petitioned. Frizznik came to investigate and his finding were this:<br>
<br>
YES - the mob should have lasted for 30 minutes. Instead of the 5 or so that it did last. He feels that the only way for the Dragon to have poofed is if someone Ninja'd it. He checked alot of different peeps logs that were at the raid - but unfortunately had no luck <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
For any of those that seriously had any second thoughts that Hoodlem was involved in any such Ninja of the Dragon - I would like to clear this up NOW - he had nothing to do with it - he is clean! Sorry Hoodlem for peeps initial accusations <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I felt it necessary to make sure peeps knew u didnt do it.<br>
<br>
So as many Everquest Raiding Adventures that I have been on, I learned alot of things on this raid and hopefully this will NOT happen again. To any of you that lost out from the disappearing loot - I sincerely apologize BUT Thank You for continued support even when YOU found out it was gone. HUGS to u all!<br>
<br>
Thank you Lealiu for letting me know that Ragefire was up to begin with and holding camp till troops arrived! Thanks to Hurm for being my personal meatshield and MA. Thank you Ballhaus and Hover for making ALOT of trips back to the Liar to take peeps outta there when we were done. (I was so worried Naggy was gona pop on our heads - rumor was that he was due)<br>
<br>
I need to give a very very SPECIAL THANK YOU - to my Sweetheart and loving Husband Vladamir, for he took on many raiding responsibilities and most importantly kept me from losing my freaking mind during this entire raid as I was  STRESSIN Big Time. I hate thrown together raids. Peeps lives are in your hands - and the chances for something to drastically go wrong are much higher. Thank u my love - You are the BEST ! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
With all the Thank Yous that I felt necessary, I also have an apology to make to an old friend - MARGOR - I had offered my help to him this night in Lake Rathe with a portion of his epic to try and get a drake to spawn - and when I heard Ragefire was up, I had to let him down <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Peeps were telling me not to worry about it and that he would understand -  BUT it doesnt excuse the fact the I do feel bad and I hope he can forgive me. I am sincerely Sorry Margor.<br>
<br>
Even without a guild family - I feel that Lanys once again has shown their community mindedness and support - I feel the LOVE, heheh. I know that I havent mentioned everyone individually by name, for some of you I didnt even know - and you were there for me. But please know that I am most Greatful - and I will never forget the support that everyone showed me this day.<br>
<br>

See you in Norrath my friends!<br>

The 30 minute timer for mobs starts at 55.<br>
<br>
I think ragefire is the only &quot;boss mob&quot; left in the game that is not 55+, so mabye friznik forgot about that fact.<br>
<br>
It is quite possible that no one ninja ed rage, and he simply poofed from corpse timer ( about 7-8 minutes ).<br>
<br>
I honestly would rather believe it poofed than someone ninjad him again.<br>

<br>
I want to congratulate both Helina and Lealiu for getting their epic pieces and another to Helina for getting her epic. It was a thrill to watch her turn in the last piece and wield her sprinkler!<br>
<br>
As Helina mentioned, we were concerned with trying to get enough peeps together not having our own guild to call upon and this was so quickly taken away as a concern as many of you dropped what you were doing and came to help. Helina pretty much mentioned every most above but to everyone....<br>
<br>
Thank you so much for giving your time, your skills, and especially your friendship to help us out! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ualhazro.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Alhazro</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>w4nn4b3!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(9/6/01 7:30:50 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A Thank You From Helina . . .</span><hr size=1> Congrats on your sweet epic helina =) <p><br><font color=red>

I'm very happy that I was there to help as was many other in VI. As for the poofed dragon...we had the same exact thing happen to us on Wytie's Rage...it poofed after no more than 6 minutes or so. We had a bp and a bracer of Fenin Ro and tho we got the BP to the loot winner, the bracer rotted before we could rez in the loot winner of that. So, it is my belief that people are mistaken on the corpse timer of this mob OR the corpse timer is bugged and is poofing sooner than it is supposed to.  <p><font color=9999FF size=2>

Things were handled very well considering how excited you both must have been to get very important pieces for your epics, its hard to think straight at times that you have such a rush going on and everyone on the raid did an awesome job.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>
