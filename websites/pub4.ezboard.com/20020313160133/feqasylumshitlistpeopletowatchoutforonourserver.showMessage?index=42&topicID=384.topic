<br>
Does anyone even REMEMBER the origional post?<br>
<br>
Everyone has their own opinion, I started this post because there was a PL'er (not illegal unto itself) who came over to our camp and THREATHENED us that he would KS us and ruin our camp because he thought that we were &quot;stealing his spawns&quot; from the multiple camps they had upstairs.  (which is AFTER they had driven away all the other groups of players that were trying to camp there) Because in his honest opinion &quot;you newbies don't mean dick to me&quot;  I even have the logs where he started KS'ing a pickclaw right after, that we had started fighting.<br>
<br>
[Sun Jan 21 22:35:34 2001] a pickclaw warrior slashes Tashmire for 3 points of damage.<br>
[Sun Jan 21 22:35:34 2001] a pickclaw warrior slashes Tashmire for 3 points of damage.<br>
[Sun Jan 21 22:35:36 2001] Tashmire slashes a pickclaw warrior for 25 points of damage.<br>
[Sun Jan 21 22:35:36 2001] Tashmire slashes a pickclaw warrior for 17 points of damage.<br>
[Sun Jan 21 22:35:36 2001] a pickclaw warrior is bathed in starfire.<br>
[Sun Jan 21 22:35:36 2001] a pickclaw warrior slashes Dirtt for 26 points of damage.<br>
[Sun Jan 21 22:35:39 2001] a pickclaw warrior slashes Dirtt for 46 points of damage.<br>
[Sun Jan 21 22:35:39 2001] a pickclaw warrior slashes Dirtt for 46 points of damage.<br>
<br>
(and FYI yes i know Tashmire can be a dick - but he IS a fair player - this thread is NOT about him)<br>
<br>
THEN when we petition that this guy is threatening us and KS'ing to the GM, who was there the entire time and watching all this happen comes in and asks Dirtt to PLEASE share the zone with other groups AND that this was not the first time that they had recieved this kind of complaint about him {that part of the log was truncated from the first post to the 2nd post, but the first half of the sentance is there }<br>
<br>
[Sun Jan 21 22:39:29 2001] Alderwolf says, 'I've been watching you and Jadewind. Takeing this whole zone has caused a disruption and it's not the first time your;ve done it'<br>
[Sun Jan 21 22:40:44 2001] Alderwolf says, 'Pleaes stop causeing a disruption with your mouth Dirtt and play nice k'<br>
<br>
So he looks at the GM and tells him to &quot;shut up&quot; because he has no idea what he is talking about.  The gm didn't just teleport in and slap his wrist he had been there for at least 20 minutes watching what was going on and we had 3 other GM's on tell looking into the situation at the same time.<br>
<br>
After that the trains start - figuring if he (Jademist) kills us off they can have the warrior and/or raider room too, which by the way is much better XP and XP is the name of the game when you are PL'ing someone.<br>
<br>
NOW - perhaps Dirtt had no idea that this was happening becuase Jademist was pulling and Dirtt thought that he had the Raider room.  <br>
<br>
Perhaps he thought we were stealing the Raider room spawn - which meant FYI that they were controlling the hi-room spawn, the lo-room spawn, the stair and hallway spawn AND the raider spawn.  Leaving us with the 3 pop warrior spawn.<br>
<br>
We all play this game for fun - we all WANT to have fun. If someone /petitions to a GM because someone is not playing by the RULES or even being decent enough to SHARE and then starts using threats and intimidation and THEN refuses to abide by the GM's decision - then what? <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Would YOU put them on the shit list?<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The Shit List is like the Stockades, you are displayed to the whole community and chained to the town square.  We don't CARE if your Uncle Ed was playing your character when he Ninja Looted something, yea - maybe you WERE having a bad day, or your dog died or something.  The point is the GM's have the final say.<br>
<br>
But when a GM' tells you that this isn't the first time you have done this, and to stop, do you tell him to shut up?<br>
<br>
If you are playing baseball and the referee makes a &quot;bad call&quot;  you either swallow it down or you get thrown out of the game.<br>
<br>
I think this list serves it's own purpose - many people who play don't even know this list exists and have valid issues against players.  If they happen to find this list and see a post where someone else has had problems with a character, they can chime in too, and not feel like they were the only ones who felt this way.<br>
<br>
And maybe if someone is having a bad day and takes it out on alot of other people trying to have FUN - perhaps this is a wake up call to &quot;fly straight&quot; and they never get listed again.<br>
<br>
Only time will tell for an instance like that.<br>
<br>
Just don't get Shit Listed again<br>
