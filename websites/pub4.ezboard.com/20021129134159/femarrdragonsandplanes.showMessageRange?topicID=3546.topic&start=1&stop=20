WTF ???</span><hr size=1> In summer of 99' I had the good fortune to have joined this wild, wacky adventure in Everquest.  It has been a wonderful experience all and all.  I have met some of the finest people from all over the world and had the opportunity to spend face to face time with quite a few.  Shortly after my beginnings as a Paladin I learned that having good friends in this game meant being a good friend.  Many times that meant leaving camps to help retrieve corpses, rescue missions, helping others camp and setting my own wants and needs aside for the moment.  In the early levels I learned of frustration and mastery, heartache and losing everything and having to start all over again, but I have always been respectful, considerate and tried to treat people that I have met along the way with dignity and encouraging words as I try to do in my real life here is Southern California (there are many that would atest to that I am sure and Bard songs and messages left up on the board in HighPass embarrasing me saying thank you).  I learned that when one's athletic surfer body betrays oneself and an aneurism blows up and dissects the aorta right down the middle and travels down one's back and paralyzes him from the hips on down and places him in CCU and ICU hanging on to precious life for 5 weeks, that it is extremely difficult (once one is out of danger and awake) to convince the head nurse and the cardiology team that finishing a quest piece in order to be able to obtain a special sword is a most therapeutic process of healing oneself while hooked up to IV's and monitors.  When I returned home and to the game and my many friends here, your outpouring of love and best wishes and encouragement to work hard to get my legs back was never and will NEVER be forgotten ... please know that last week in 82 degree weather, I took off and surfed my first wave ... the first I had ridden in over 3 years... thank you ... so many of you that helped me back with your encouragement to be able to do that again.  I finally was able to obtain my 60th level as a Paladin, have been a member of several fine guilds and continued to enjoy wonderful times and friends in Everquest here on the Erollisi Marr Server.  Sometime ago I was asked if my Paladin could be used while I was away starting a new clinic and seeing some of my own patients ... it was for a rescue operation and major problem up on one of the planes and so I gave my cleric friend and guildmate, Ailelina, permission to access my account.  Periodically she would use Tchoover the Paladin to help in guild activities and help others ... I had no problem with that.  About four months ago my father was diagnosed with milignant melanoma and it was spreading fast and they were not able to discern where the cancer was coming from.  Since that time several months ago, I have only been able to come in to Everquest once or twice for only a short period of time.  My place and responsibilities are to my immediate family crisis and then to my patients in my practice so time spent here has become much, much less.  Earlier this afternoon I received an e-mail from Lead GM Azhra with an official Sony name and address stating that Tchoover, my character has been permanently banned from Everquest for &quot;hate mongering and use of offensive and abusive language&quot; and that my access to the game I respect and thoroughly enjoy and the many, many friends that I have made along the way, has been removed forever.  I am still in shock and numbed.  I have written them back asking them to please investigate this if it is possible - I have written (as you can imagine) a rather sharp letter to my friend ??? Ailelina the Cleric wanting to know what in the world is going on and how something like that could have happened, and still have a tough time believing that she would be a part of that kind of action, yet she was the only one that I ever gave access and permision to to utilize my character ... so I am here for several reasons.  FIRST: To ask for suggestions on what I might be able to do to remedy this.  It is obvious to me that someone has access to my account and only one person ever has gotten that access from me ... SECONDLY: I am asking that if any of you in the past several months have had dealing with my character Tchoover whom was being puppeted in a most negatively chaotic and unsociallably acceptable manner would you please contact me and let me know what those negative dealing were   timmytch@hotmail.com  and THIRD and most of all ... for ANY of you who was subject to any type of verbal abuse, hate mongering type of behavior or offensive language that insulted, hurt, or angered you and/or any of your friends, guildmates, or companions ... I am extremely sorry.... the person (Tim) who writes this message and the person (Tim) who has spent hundreds and hundreds of hours with many of you is not that type of individual and doesn't tolerate that kind of action, be that here in the Worlds of Everquest nor in my real world and the work that I do nor with the people that are in my life.  I am hoping to find out who the person or persons were that are behind this action and hope that there will be swift and negative consequences for their completely inappropriate behavior.  If any of you have any thoughts, ideas, solutions I would be most appreciative. I don't know if I will be allowed back into the game - hopefully so, but if not - I raise my 'Sword of Doljonijiarnimorinar' in respect and wish you all well in your endeavors, and thank you all for allowing me the opportunity, and fun, and friendships, and quests of mastery that I have had and thoroughly enjoyed amongst you.<br>

<br>
Email accounts@soe.sony.com and CC it to eqaccountstatus@soe.sony.com telling them something along the lines of how long you've been playing, how you suddenly came to log on after a short break (for whatever reason) to find the account banned, how you've been looking forward to PoP and how you would be extremely grateful if they would reinstate the account.  Worked for me <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I don't see how your account got a flat out ban though... it usually takes a suspension first at the least, if not suspension and a couple of warnings.  It took me 4 official warnings and a suspension before i got a ban when i was ASKING them to ban me (yes, i got a warning for asking to be banned).<br>
<br>
Anyway... I hope you can get it sorted out <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Getting accounts unbanned isn't all that difficult, you just need a good story.  Doesn't have to be true, just has to sound true (i very much doubt they'll be going to too much trouble researching your story when they can shut you up with a simple click on your tag).<br>

<br>
Tchoover. The only thing I can think of is that when VI tell you that is was due to abusive play on such and such a date send an e-mail that says &quot;Thats' impossible. I was skiing in France that month&quot; Ask them to confirm the dates and times and show you any evidence against you.<br>
<br>
Do not mention that you have given out the password. If you do or if you have, all is lost.<br>
<br>
Tell them your family has access to the password and that you will look into the matter. Then e-mail them to say nobody in your house has owned up to it but you have permission from your mother to change the password to one only you know. Apologise if your actions have caused distress to anyone and ask nicely if they will re-instate your account.<br>
<br>
Explain that you have just purchased the luclin expansion and were considering moveing to legends.<br>
<br>
For anyone else reading this, I bumped into Tchoover a few times over the course of my time in EQ and he is/was one of the most helpful guys I've met in a while to an almost complete stranger. Thats why my sympathy on this one. <p><CENTER><A HREF="http://ak.lonelygamer.com">

classic example of someone letting another person use their account, while that person turns and insults people and does stuff that could get the real owner of the character in trouble. One of these days, if I can remember the name of the chanter, I might drop her a line and ask if she's aware of what that person has been doing with her char. Hopefully she doesn't know.

Sounds like you've gotten the wrong end of the stick in real life and the pixelated one also. I truly hope you can get your account reinstated because I'd enjoy running into a person such as yourself in the game. Not once in your post did you revert to shortcuts or dood-speak. I can appreciate that.<br>
<br>
Its quite obvious from what I've read that you aren't the type to run around spreading hate and discontent in a game of all things, so you should be able to get it back taking head to Ryn's sound advice. <p><table align=center>

<br>
I'm really sorry to hear that.  It sounds like a nightmare.  I know that VI can confirm the ISP address'  ask them to look into the address that was using the account when the offsensive behavior occured.  That should help prove it wasn't yours.  <br>
<br>
I would not tell them you gave out your password.<br>
<br>
You are the victum once they see it that way IE if they think you were hacked, you will be in a better position to work with them.  <br>
<br>
Good Luck!  You have always been one of the nicest people I have met in EQ. <p>

<br>
Although the suggestions that others have given out will hopefully prove successful.  GMs can find out anything about you, IP addresses in especially, and it will prove that you're not guilty.  It is a very good idea, as others have said, to email Verant and explain the situation.<br>
<br>
Also, it is true that you must not tell them that you've given out your password.  That there is an automatic bannable offense.  I made the mistake of telling a GM once that I had let a friend of mine use my account o try out EQ to see if he wanted to buy it or not. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :o --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/embarassed.gif ALT=":o"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
Luckily she let me go with a mere slap on the wrist with a newspaper and a warning of, &quot;Don't do it again.&quot; <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
You are definitely a person I would enjoy running into ingame, and also have the privilage of grouping with you, where ever that may be.  If you need anything at all, I urge you to send me a tell and I will do what I can.  Best wishes on getting your account reinstated!<br>

Tchoover is by far one of the nicest people I've had the good fortune to meet while playing EQ, and its an injustice that such ill would befall such a stand up guy.<br>
