We were in necro and decided to move to D1, she was our main tank. Our cleric had some hesitations as she was taking too much damage. So I ask her what lvl she is. She says she is 53. him she cons blue to me, and I am 53. &lt;sigh&gt; Finally find out she if 51, but no big deal. Being as my friend Sylteena taught me all about uneven groupage, I have been in D1 with a bard and druid as main mezzers and healers, so I quickly reassured him we could do it. Hell we had a war, mnk, clr, dru, enc, shm. So off to B3 we head....<br>
<br>
Then I notice her letting the monk engage the mobs, letting him take sufficent amonut of the hate list before she attacks. If they started to hit her she would back off. She didn't taunt off the cleric or enchie (or even me the poor druid *sob*). Then using a frog the enchie made into a pet, to save us <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  a frog broke my snare (think he was dispelled. All I saw was your snare has worn off message and a frog run followed by a pet) Uh-oh we think. So the enchie logs real quick to clear aggo. We were all fine at this point, the pet came back alone, luckily he didn't run into anyone. But she runs back tot he group, says she is &quot;LD brb&quot; sits and /q'd. At this point I am like 'WTF' /shout D1 looking for tank. The group decided to not re-invite her. So she runs off to restart a necro group and gets herself killed before she even gets across the bridge.<br>
<br>
<br>
I think it is a test of how much you suck as a warrior if your group drops you and replaces you with a ranger, as the main tank. As that is what we did and finally moved to D1. Crinkle came to seb to save us and did a great job as our main, with Eblan pulling. We had our cleric and enchie go LD at very bad times and not once did anyone lose their heads. We all just took up with dru and shm rooting and healing and carried on. It was a great display of teamwork in people who have never worked together before and goes to show you don't always have to have what people consider the perfect group. <p>Nickle Ante<BR>

<br>
We were in the SS room in Sol B and she zoned in LFG, we were a bit short on tankage so told her to come over, but she didnt know the way so someone had to get her (no big deal I get lost in Guk all the time) then when she joined it was like she was reading some print out about sol B (where does this or that drop, etc) then she tells te monk pulling bugs to &quot;pull reds and yellows!&quot; umm we were all 49-52 and anything that conns Red or Yellow would wipe out a single group we explained. <br>
<br>
Then she said &quot;can we do fire giants?&quot; <br>
<br>
Uhh no.(they were all dead anyway) <br>
<br>
She stayed for a while but I think the fact that SolB loots sucks and is basicly a EXP dungeon now got to her and she left...<br>

The observation that she will get you killed is accurate. <br>
Bad puller, late to engage, never taunts and loots-a-lot. If <br>
after each fight your cleric, enchanter and rogue (me) are <br>
the most battered up in the group (and I was Evading like a <br>
mofo) then &quot;someone&quot; can't find her Taunt button. Even with <br>
mezzed mobs, she didn't seem to get the idea of taunting it <br>
out of mez *shrug*. Loot aside, group with her if you want to <br>
have your cleric low on mana a lot. <br>
<br>
She will get you killed ... end of story.<br>
<br>
P.S. Scootie if you read this, give the damn gloves back, <br>
or ebay them and your account because as far as getting <br>
groupage, you are fooked. Black luck on you. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uractervargun.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Racter Vargun</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 22<br> <font color=#E9D756>(7/10/01 10:41:54 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrscammeralert.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=132.topic&index=27>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: SCOOTIE is a scammer</span><hr size=1> Justa tell ya...in SolB she sat there in King room and ninja'd every single loot...she never ever ever let anyone else loot.

<br>
Situation 1 - Head into KC LFG.  She comes over and does a blind invite, no /t, no /say, no nothing.  This gets me leary, but hey, I don't feel like waiting around.  We fill out, do some zone pulls (nothing serious), and head to RCY.  Our cleric accidently agros the entire RCY and we get a massive furball.<br>
<br>
We didn't have an enchanter, but what followed was the best root parking I have ever seen.  Druid, cleric, and paladin had the situation controlled in about 30 sec., and we handled it.  There was some serious mana usage, but that could be expected.  No one died.<br>
<br>
Not 2 seconds after the last body is looted (in all honesty, I don't know WHO was looting, but I can take a guess), Scootie runs through the doorway.  No mana check, no nothing.  She comes back with another 6 in less than 20 seconds!  The cleric and druid had both said don't overpull, we have little mana, and I was typing my &quot;get back here&quot; response when I saw the mess that followed her out.<br>
<br>
But wait, it gets better.  Being the nice people we were, we do the best we can with the situation.  We get half parked, kill one, and are figuring out what to kill next when I realize Scootie isn't around.  She is in zone, but not for long.  She zones out (rest of group is still in RCY, and now NO tank) without calling train (for the zone's benefit) and without telling us (I guess you don't need a main tank to face mobs in this game).  I announce this to the group, and we beat feet to the zone.  Group reformed later without her and enjoyed a better evening.<br>
<br>
Situation 2 - Cousin is on another computer in Seb looking for a group.  I glance over on his screen and see Scootie at zone in running around willy nilly.  I tell him he better watch out, she is a loose cannon.  He says, &quot;Yea, I know&quot; and continues to look for a group.<br>
<br>
Not 2 minutes later Scootie returns to zone IN at Seb with about 4 frogs.  She dies at the back of the zone in, and that puts everyone on agro.  At least 7 bodies came out of that mess, including my cousin.<br>
<br>
To answer Swiftpine, she isn't banned because she isn't doing anything &quot;bannable&quot;, at least in this thread.  Ninja looting is very uncool, but thats technically not a scam right?  Its just being greedy.  Furthermore, one thing you cannot be banned for is rampant stupidity, and she seems to have caught the down tick and bought extra in that department.<br>
<br>
This is the first person to make me institute a no group policy if I happen to get invited to somewhere she is.  Its just not worth the frustration. <p>Tanuden <BR>

  Perhaps she just had a bad day the day I encountered her. The tactics I observed: pulling with no chance of healing (healers OOM), running excess near other groups to be JUST outside the boundary of training them but hoping they would pick up excess after realizing the group could not handle the pull, and telling incoming as the MoBs were already in camp w/o warning she was looking (the group at this time had &lt;35th level casters and so had NO clue) are not sound tactics under any circumstances. &quot;<br>
