I have known Velleius since a lvl 8 newbie in G Fay.  I met him when I told off a lvl 3 warrior who was flaming the zone because newbies who did not know any better were shouting when they should use /ooc or /auc.  I told him to be a little more understanding, as us newbies didnt always know things like that when we first started out<br>
<br>
After a me telling him off, we got to talking, and we got on well.  I even offered to help him kill some wasps (lvl 8 pling lvl 3, ROFL).  He didnt take up my offer, and seemed to find it very amusing for some reason.<br>
<br>
When the lvl 3 logged, I found out why, as I received a tell from Velleius a lvl 39 monk (and as far as I was concerned, lvl 39 was godlike to a lvl 8 newbie).  Over the months, we got to know each otther well, he came over to Gfay to see me once or twice, and when i made it over to Freeport at level 12, he suddenly appeared at NFP bank, and gave me my 1st uber items, drake hide legs, opaline earings, and and ice bear cloak.  To a lvl 12 still in cloth and silk these were sheer heaven.  Over time, he added to these, giving me around 1500pp in gear over time.  Thanks to his kindness, I always had gear at least 5 levels higher than my true level.  I shall never forget this kindness.<br>
<br>
Over time, I leveled well, and with Velleius playing so many twinks, I started to catch up with him.  I also became a jeweler, and when I got 250 skill, was able to afford some nice stuff for myself, and also to repay some of the kindnesss Velleius gave to me with jewlery and plat.  He stopped playing every now and again, but he always came back.  <br>
<br>
One time he left for quite a while, when he discovered that his in game fiancee was in fact a RL male.  This upset him greatly at the time. It also caused me some problems too, because before they split up, she/he had given him some items, an oracle robe amongst them (back when oracle robes were still rare).  Understandably, he felt so betrayed by his supposed fiancee, he felt that keeping the robes would provide at least some comeback.  As he/she knew I knew Velleius, for a while she was asking if I had seen him, and could I help get her items back.  I did not help, and I am sorry I didn't.<br>
<br>
Finally, he said he was going to give up the game forever, stripped his char, gave all his stuff to friends, and stopped playing.<br>
<br>
3 months later he returned.  His only problem was, he had no gear, and whilst his friends, including myself, cobbled together some plat and items, he was still nowhere near where he was when he left.  <br>
<br>
Around this time, I had been leveling real slow (lvl 35 hell), mainly because I was doing much trading in EC, and Velleius very kindly offered to help me out, by getting me a couple of levels whilst I wasnt playing.  To be honest, I didn't like the idea, if you haven't earnt your own levels, whats the point of playing! However, I sensed Velleius wanted to in some way pay back some of the plat and jewlery I had given him, and this was the only way he could think how, and I wanted to acknowledge his kind thought.  <br>
<br>
Of course you all know what happens next.  I gave him my account details.  One week later, having camped in FV, I come back to find my char in EC tunnel, my account stripped, my bank account empty, with around 25Kp of gear I was wearing gone.<br>
<br>
I refused to beleive it was Velleius.  I petitioned immediately of course, but even in my petition I did not mention that is was Velleius who might have done it.  It was 3 days before the guides got back to me.  All that time, I waited for Velleius to come back on.  I went from zone to zone asking if anyone knew Velleius or his alts.  Eventually said they knew the alt he was playing, and would get him to send me a tell.<br>
<br>
The GM eventually got back to me, and I explained what had happened, and I admitted I had given my account details to someone else, but I also said that I was 100% certain it was not him who had done it.  Amazingly, they restored my account.  I now know how lucky I was they did this, everything I have heard since tells me that if this happens, its your tough luck, you lose the lot.  <br>
<br>
Whilst I was talking to the GM, waiting for my account to be restored Velleius came on line, and sent me a tell. He told me he was devastated at hearing what had happened.  He said the only thing he could think of was that a friend, who also played EQ, might have seen my account details written down on a piece of paper, and that he could have have been the one who emptied my account.  When I pressed him on who this person was, he wouldn't give me their name, saying there was no point, as he beleived they had already deleted their main and transferred the gear to a new account, and he didnt know who they were.<br>
<br>
I chose to beleive him.  I could not face the alternative.  All of us have in the game one person who we would do anything for, usually someone we 1st met in those early newbie days, someone you have hunted with forever, and know inside out, someone you would ask to do a transfer of your Heiro cloack and necklace of superiority to another char without even a heartbeats thought.  That was Velleius to me, and that he was the one who cheated me was inconceivable.<br>
<br>
However, over the next few weeks, I started to have niggles.  As I spend most of my time trading in EC, I was there to see that Velleius was slowly upgrading his gear with stuff I knew he could not afford.  From having only around 10kp of stuff, he improved it to items worth about 30kp.  Where before he was scrabbling for 500pp, he now seemed to be able to afford 5kp for items.  I did not know what to think, but even now, I still chose to delude myself.  When I asked him where this money came from, he explained it was from from trading in EC, when he saw items go cheap cos there traders were sick of waiting for a good price, he would buy, and sell on for a big profit, over time he hade made a fortune doing this.  I still chose to beleive him.<br>
<br>
So, what finally changed my mind.  First off a different Velleius seemed to emerge, my jeweling had bought me some really nice items, NoS, heiro, Tranix Crown etc, and when he inspected he almost seemed to become angry that I had such nice stuff at 45, when he still only had mediocre stuff at 49.  Instead of waiting for me to offer him jewlery for a new twink he was playing, or plat for an items he really wanted, he was now almost demanding it, with the attitude 'you have so much money, so give me some.<br>
<br>
The final straw was when a guildie sent me a tell who knew that I knew Velleius.  He also was a monk, and, during Velleius's breif time in my guild Relm of Nine (he stayed about a week) he had lent him a sage battle staff.  Now he could not get it back.  Every time Velleius came on, he did not reply to tells, and logged soon after.  All, as we know, the classic signs of a scammer.  I have been hoping he would come on for the past month so I could ask him what was going on, but he did not appear, so I couldnt.  I suspect he will simply have created one more alt to play, and tranferred the stuff accross to begin again.<br>
<br>
So there comes a point where even I cannot ignore that he is a scammer.  He scammed his ingame fiance of 2kp of items, he scammed me of 30kp of gear, and he scammed a guildie of a 10kp item.  Too much for even a stupid foolish enchanter like me to ignore.<br>
<br>
This has been a long post, and I apologise for making it so, but I wanted to give a flavour of the depths of this betrayal.  I know that Velleius has many, many friends in EQ.  He played a warrior to lvl 51, before he played Velleius, so he will have many friends from those days.  He also knows his class extremely well, and has a great reputation as such.  He is also capable of great kindness and generosity.  But to his friends, I must warn you, he is not to be trusted, and no matter how well you think you know him, you do not.<br>
<br>
In the end, I half hope his friends will post lots of flames on me, to say no, this isnt true, this isn't the Velleius I know, you must be wrong.  I even hope Velleius will post to say it was all a big mistake, and that I am wrong. but in my heart of hearts, I know it ain't so.<br>
<br>
In sadness at the loss of a once great friend,<br>

Please do not discourage people from reporting scammers.

<br>
Where did I try to discourage people from reporting scammers? Or is that just a part of my post that your over active imagination made up? Reporting scammers is all fine and good, I was just simply giving my opinion to the original post, most of the time my opinion is needed about as much as a whole in the head, but guess what? I am still going to give it anyway.<br>
<br>
Please do not put words into my mouth, it only serves to make you look like a tool.<br>

<br>
Firstly, on the putting words in your mouth.  The only attitude I asserted you held was saying that you knew Ysall wasn't trying for sympathy.  That was my bad; I do not know if you thought she was trying for sympathy or not.  It seemed obvious to me she was not, but then I have different assumptions than you, and you might have honestly thought she was.  So for that I do apologize.  Sorry.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
In regards to discouraging her, this has nothing to do with words being put in your mouth, but simple human nature.  You quote a portion of her post and then state &quot;I stopped reading right there.&quot;  That discourages people.  Why should someone write out specifics of a scam so others can see what they did (alerting us to a scammer) if the first response to their report says that a person didn't read it?  This is a negative response and it influences people to not do something.  <br>
<br>
You also state that Ysall gets no sympathy.  Again, this is a negative reaction because despite how it could have been avoided, someone was harmed by the actions of a person.  Not having sympathy is one thing.  However, to *state* directly to the victim of scam that you have no sympathy again can be inferred (not implied) to mean they were at fault.  This is a negative response and it influences people to not do something.<br>
<br>
Your post did nothing to give further information on the scam.  It did two things (show disinterest, show what could be perceived as a hostile reaction) which will influence other people to not post here in the future.<br>
<br>
Does this mean no one will ever use this board again because of your response?  Of course not.  But if someone who is more thin skinned or shy gets scammed, even if it could have been avoided easily, they might not post here and then this board has failed to alert EMarr of scammers (people I will not know to avoid in my guild or in my groups), because of your post.<br>
<br>
I am not suggesting you are doing this intentionally.  I have no clue if you are or not. However, that is the effect your posts will have.  Hence, I reiterate, please do not discourage people from reporting scammers.  Thank you for your time. <p>Salenie Silkweaver<BR>Proud Member of <a href=" http://www.clanbattleaxe.com">Clan Battle Axe</a>

Damn I didn't know I had such power over people, so what you are basically saying is that if I say &quot;I stopped reading your post right there&quot; that other people will do the same thing? Thats some funny stuff.<br>
