While personal attacks are fun (and I do enjoy them at times) they can't really comprise the stuff of a rant, since the audience may not fully be aware of the characteristics of the individual being attacked. Hence our good friend the flame comes to play.<br><br>A "flame" is nothing more than an angry, hostile, and out right abusive posting usually directed at an individual. When desiring to heap abuse on one person (or a group sharing similar characteristics) the flame provides the avenue for framing the best ad hominem.<br><br>However, there is only so much one can do with a flame, since even the least resilient are able to become numb to the abuse heaped upon them.<br><br>The current state of EMarr's Rants and Flame board is such that flames are not really effective or laudable (where they ever really?). There is only so much abuse that can be heaped upon Mitch and Chiteng, or others, before it is realized that nothing will really change. Even the entertainment that was once apparent loses its pull and leaves all engaging in the flame looking stupid and empty.<br><br>Even the Rants have lost their flavor. Really, what is there to rant about that hasn't been written down before? VI's bad customer service? The lag? Pricing? Etc? We have all heard it before.<br><br>Well, I am one person who is committing to not participating in Rants and Flames any more. Yes, I have heaped abuses. I am not proud of that fact. Indeed, I think it is sad. I am asking that others join me. I think we could eventually see much less activity on Rants and Flames. Indeed, we could leave those who find the tiresome back and forth flaming alone to themselves (here I am thinking of Mitch, Chiteng, and Dwarkarn).<br><br>My opinion. Take it or leave it. Flames welcome, but they will get no response from this end.<br><br>Thanks for reading if you made it this far.<br> <p><center><font face="arial" color="CCFFFF">Lurikeen Mali'Kyre</FONT></center><center><table style='Filter: Shadow(Color=#150517, Direction=225)'><tr><td><span class='Necromancer'><font size=2 color="red" face="arial"><i>NECROMANCER</span></td></tr></table></font></i></center><center><font face=arial></center><center><I>"My eyes will pierce your soul, then I will take your life!"</I></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/udwarkarn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dwarkarn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 4023<br> <font color=#E9D756>(5/25/02 8:47:09 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3365.topic&index=1>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Why Rants and Flames should not continue</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> My opinion.

You see Lurikeen you fall into the same mental mindset<br>as many on the board. You see the superficial, and you choose to assume<br>'THAT' is the reality. It isnt. I myself am guilty of the same thing at times.<br>It is 'easy' to think that guild 'XYZ' is evil and should be destroyed.<br>Until you meet someone from the guild that isnt evil, and actually seems nice.<br>But it is 'comforting' to choose to think that all your 'opponents'<br>(ie anyone that might possible disagree with you) are 'simple'.<br>The reason is obvious, if they are NOT as simple as you think they are, then suddenly your in more danger that you thought you were. That idea is<br>dis-comfiting.<br><br>If I have ten reasons to post, and disclose 3 of them. Does that mean the other dont exist? Of course not.<br><br>So as I said it is easy, very easy to assume that your opponent is a simple-minded fool. However, that assumption can turn around and bite you.<br><br>I agree that the 4 of us get disproportional attention but that is the audience fault<br>for giving the attention. My posts are clearly labled and easily ignored. yet they never are. Why is that?<br><br>The reality is that as I said earlier, the 'guiding lights' of the board are long gone.<br>The 'fun' of the board is absent for them. They left. I cant say that I blame them.<br>If the joy of playing is soured for you, the board becomes a painfull reminder<br>of wasted time and happier times. How do I know that the game as is sux?<br>because I knew those players, like it or not we were comrades. I know right now<br>that if the game were still fun to play, THEY WOULD BE PLAYING IT. <br>Sure you can shout me down, but you will find it hard to ignore that truth.<br>!6 hours to camp an item, that helps ONE player. How many are in the guild?<br>How many hours does that add up to? You cant escape the obvious conclusion.<br>Yes you CAN scream at me that I am wrong and that the game is still fun,<br>that is what they always do, and I simply shake my head. The evidence is lying<br>on the ground before you, and you pretend it isnt there.<br><br>I am sorry I have dissapointed you Lurikeen, I am just one.<br><br>If you want to subract your implicit blame casting, and state the board isnt usefull<br>any longer THEN I might agree.<br><br>None of us are what we seem to be. All us us take hidden solace in the fact that<br>'opponent A' doesnt really know 'XYZ' about me and thus what he has said can be ignored. Like I said, its comforting. Doesnt make it true however.<br><br> <p>“It is clear that the individual who persecutes a man, his brother, because he is not of the same opinion, is a monster.”Voltaire</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uchukzombi.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Chukzombi</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://chukzombi.homestead.com/files/usa5_2.gif   " BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Undead Shaman</span><br>  Posts: 2398<br> <font color=#E9D756>(5/25/02 9:53:25 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3365.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Why Rants and Flames should not continue</span><hr size=1> Im like the nicest person in game, i need this forum to vent my little annoyances. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=6742"target="_blank"> <font color=gold>Chukzombi Astrocreep </font><BR><a href="http://www.magisterguild.org/" target="_blank"> <font color=red>Magister</font><BR><http://chukzombi.homestead.com/files/usa5_2.gif></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ulurikeen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lurikeen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 710<br> <font color=#E9D756>(5/25/02 10:21:25 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3365.topic&index=4>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Why Rants and Flames should not continue</span><hr size=1> <i>"I was with you all the way except.....you just had to toss in the oblique<br>assertion that somehow I was responsible for the 'decline?' of the board."</i><br><br>Chiteng, I didn't say that you alone are responsible for the decline of Rants and Flames. Indeed, Mitch and Dwarkarn are your compatriots with the decline. Further, I don't mean my posting as a flame. I am only reporting the facts as I see them. I am positive you, Mitch and Dwarkarn will deny the allegations I have brought. Indeed, Dwarkarn has already provided his most predictable response.<br><br>Chuk, I am not saying that we shouldn't have a forum where genuine rants and flames could be posted. My complaint is that a handfull have hijacked the forum in its entirety. When was the last time a single thread didn't have Mitch, Chiteng, or Dwarkarn fighting it out in it? You could post "All baby seals should die" but sooner or later two out of those three will hijack the thread and bore us to death with their drivel.<br><br>I am just saying enough is enough.

Im extremely happy with the way things are going with my family.  <br><br><br>Flaming Mitch is my pleasure.  <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=6742"target="_blank"> <font color=gold>Chukzombi Astrocreep </font><BR><a href="http://www.magisterguild.org/" target="_blank"> <font color=red>Magister</font><BR><http://chukzombi.homestead.com/files/usa5_2.gif></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/udwarkarn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dwarkarn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 4027<br> <font color=#E9D756>(5/26/02 12:44:18 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3365.topic&index=11>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Why Rants and Flames should not continue</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>Like how bad Dwarkan's new sig is.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br><br>Glad it causes you displeasure, I shall make sure I keep it for twice as long now.<br> <p><center><img src="http://members.dodo.net.au/~raymies/rolesig.jpg"><BR><center><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=6929">Rolelen Dwarkarn - 58 Myrmidon </a><br><BR><center><a href="http://mysticcoercion.cjb.net">Proud Officer of ~Mystic Coercion~ </a><br><p align="center"><b><a href="mailto:dwarkarn@dodo.com.au">Email</a></b> </p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/usayre.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sayre</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 185<br> <font color=#E9D756>(5/26/02 1:38:06 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3365.topic&index=12>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Why Rants and Flames should not continue</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> My opinion.
