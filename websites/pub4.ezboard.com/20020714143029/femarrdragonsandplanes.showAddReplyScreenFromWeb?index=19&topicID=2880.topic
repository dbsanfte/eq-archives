<br>
Well, no... but if someone was to come back 5-10 minutes later and say "oh man I was camping here and went LD" I wouldnt say "to bad for you!"<br>
<br>
The fact that the person "knew" I was there and decided it was now "their camp" was the part that irked me... <br>
<br>
I dont run into these problems often because I rarely fight for XP anymore unless Im grouping with friends wherever for whatever... so I was just curious as to what others would make of the similar situation.<br>
<br>
As far as going LD in group I agree 10 minutes is a good time to hold the spot... either that or when looking for replacements we say "hey someone went LD, if they come back would you mind giving them their spot back"... 9 times out of 10 they say "sure, I'll just keep looking for another group until then" or something.  <br>

The phrase is almost certainly an allusion to the fact that the first joint an adult thumb measures roughly one inch, literally a rule (or ruler) of thumb. Since human dimensions vary, any measurement so taken would be only a rough approximation and not to be trusted where precision was required. <br>
The most commonly connected tale with this story is that the original rule of thumb appeared in English Common Law. The law said that a man could not beat his wife with a stick that was thicker than his thumb. Beating her with smaller sticks was permitted, and in some regions encouraged, to keep the woman in her place. <br>
<br>
While it was certainly true that in many places in the past (and unfortunately to this present day), men were permitted to beat their wives, but this so-called rule was never codified. In fact, this explanation does not appear until relatively recently and its appearances are in American courts that claim such an old English law exists without citing it specifically. <br>
<br>
Blackstone in Commentaries on the Laws of England (1765) writes, &quot;the husband also (by the old law) might give his wife moderate correction. [...] But this power of correction was confined within reasonable bounds; and the husband was prohibited to use any violence to his wife, aliter quam ad virum, ex causa regiminis et castigationis uxoris suae, licited et rationabiliter pertinet (other than what is reasonably necessary to the discipline and correction of the wife). The civil law gave the husband the same, or a larger, authority over his wife; allowing him, for some misdemeanors, flagellis et fustibus acriter verbare uxorem (to wound his wife severely with whips and fists); for others, only modicam castigationem adhibere (to apply modest corrective punishment).&quot; No mention of thumbs at all. <br>
<br>
There are three mentions of this supposed doctrine in American case law: <br>
<br>
Bradley v. The State (1 Miss. (1 Walker) 156 (1824)) upholds the doctrine and cites a Justice Raymond as the source for the doctrine. This Raymond is probably Lord Robert Raymond, a judge on the King's Bench from 1724-1733. Despite the Mississippi court's ruling, no one has found any of Raymond's rulings that relate to such a doctrine. <br>
In 1868, State v. A.B. Rhodes (61 N.C. 453) the jury found &quot;that the defendant struck Elizabeth Rhodes, his wife, three licks, with a switch about the size of his fingers (but not as large as a man's thumb) without any provocation except some words uttered by her and not recollected by the witness.&quot; The judgment was appealed and upheld, but the appellate court ruled &quot;It is not true [...] that a husband has a right to whip his wife. And if he had, it is not easily seen how the thumb is the standard of size for the instrument which he may use, as some of the old authorities have said; and in deference to which was his Honor's charge. [...] The standard is the effect produced, and not the manner of producing it, or the instrument used.&quot; While &quot;old authorities&quot; are claimed, they are not cited. <br>
In 1873, State v. Richard Oliver (70 N.C. 60) states that &quot;we may assume that the old doctrine that a husband had a right to whip his wife, provided he used a switch no larger than his thumb, is not law in North Carolina.&quot; <br>
The closest anyone has come to identifying such a rule in English law is a supposed opinion of Francis Buller, a judge on the English bench from 1778 to 1800. In 1782, Buller held the opinion (it's not clear whether his was a legal ruling or just a publicly stated opinion) that a man had the right to beat his wife. He was widely castigated in public and called such epithets as &quot;Judge Thumb.&quot; The reaction to Buller's opinion makes it clear that this was not a widely held right. <br>
So, what we have is a single English judge who in 1782 (probably) held that a man could beat his wife with a stick narrower than his thumb. Since, according to the OED2, the phrase dates from at least 1692, this is probably not the origin of the phrase. <br>
<br>

<br>
i'm  57  and my  cleric buddy was  49  , we  were just  screwing  around and could have died  if  we went  afk  for 1 second . <br>
<br>
DON&quot;T GO AFK. <br>
<br>
even  when you  answer  campchecks  people want  your  camps .  if you  can  do  something  else and are just  screwing  around  let them  have it . <br>
<br>
i  was in  perma frost soloing  the alchemist  when a  druid  logged in  and  claimed the camp ,  what the GM  asked the lev  50  druid , name another place a lev  30  warrior can  solo  for  exp that  is out  of the way  so  if  he messes up  noone is hurt  but himself . druid couldn't  and the GM  made him  go  away (thanks valtron) <br>
<br>
this is a  game . if you  can  do  something  else without moving  to  far  ,  and don't  need the gear  , don't  argue ,  just  take a  walk  down  the passage . <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uthebudan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Thebudan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 122<br> <font color=#E9D756>(1/31/02 5:47:18 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2880.topic&index=23>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: camps </span><hr size=1> /cheer Festy<br>
