It's part of growing up.  It's just a matter of finding what makes you happy and also being old enough to do it.  Between 16 and 18 you kind of get that &quot;You can't live your own life yet, but we won't do anything for you&quot;....<br>
<br>
Makes it hard.  I was pissed off/depressed when I was 13-16 myself.  I grew out of it.  I took control of my life and did the things that I wanted to do.<br>
<br>
Nothing wrong with a GED, although I'm not sure what ESE means.  Try taking your ACT.  That can help you get into college if that's what you want to do.<br>

<br>
Short Background:  I am now 41 years old, a single dad, and enjoying life, loving life actually.  EQ is one of the things that I can do and enjoy with my oldest son, who is 15.<br>
<br>
In a short span of time (less than 3 years), this is what happened to me (about 4 years ago).  My wife got pregnant by one of my best friends, and I had to help her interview propspective adoptive parents. My quarter million dollar home burned to the ground. My oldest son had an accident and nearly lost his right arm but emergency neuro-muscular surgery saved it. I got sued twice (I won both of the suits, but defense costs were huge).  I went from a quarter million dollar home, a new Cadillac and Suburban in the garage, vacations in Europe and cruises, to having to rent a room so I wouldn't have to sleep in my 10 year old S-10 pickup truck - all in less than 3 years.  I did actually end up sleeping one night in my truck.<br>
<br>
Why do I say this?  Definetly NOT for any sympathy but to point out that life does have it's ups and downs.  I am sure most of us have our own &quot;personal sob story.&quot;  One of the things I have learned is that you CANNOT control what other people do, they will lie to you, they will cheat you, they will steal from you.  But some people will be wonderful to you too.  You can ONLY CONTROL what goes on in your own head, your own Attitude.  I want to encourage you to start looking within yourself, and not look outward for self worth. You say you have &quot;crooked front teeth&quot;, well I don't have any front teeth at all, I lost both of them in a bicycle accident when I was twelve.  I have 2 pieces of porcelain for front teeth.  I was raised with an older sister is mentally retarded and everywhere we went as a family, people stared, pointed, laughed and made fun of my sister and my family.  There was<br>
nothing I could do about it.  I prayed and prayed for God to make my sister &quot;normal&quot; but that did not happen.  God had a different plan in mind.<br>
<br>
Your post makes it sound like you want people to feel sorry for you for what has happened to you.  I don't feel sorry for what has happened, I feel sorry that you are letting what has happened control you instead of you controlling how you respond to the things that happened.<br>
<br>
Let me give a short story as an example:<br>
You are driving down the Freeway, minding your own business, in a &quot;neutral&quot; state of mind. All of a sudden, a driver on your left realizes he wants the next offramp which is<br>
rapidly approaching and swerves in front of you and over to the exit lane.  You have to slam on the brakes to avoid hitting him and start saying words that would make a sailor blush.  You get to work or school and proceed to tell everyone about the stupid drivers out there, that the freeways are not safe and that they should do something about all the idiot drivers out there.  You are ANGRY for the rest of the day.  In the mean time, the individual who did the dastardly deed, goes on his merry way and has an absolutely WONDERFUL day.  So who is the real loser here?  You have given this guy, who<br>
doesn't even KNOW you exist, CONTROL over your life for that day.  Wouldn't it be better if YOU had CONTROL over your own life?<br>
<br>
Don't wait for mom and dad, your friends at school, or anyone else to dictate to you how you feel, how your life is going to be, start taking control over your own life.  You will be surprised at how people treat you when they see the confidence instead of the anger or frustration or self pity you &quot;project&quot;.  Now don't get me wrong, I am not saying<br>
to have the attitude &quot;screw everyone else&quot;, but what I am saying is to keep in perspective what others think or say about you.  Start by doing small things that will help you build confidence in yourself.  I compliment my boys on small accomplishments as well as the larger ones.  I also tell them that they need to feel good about themselves even when other people don't compliment them.<br>
<br>
I guess that is enough rambling on.  I want to encourage you to encourage yourself, keep improving your own self esteem daily, and grab life with both hands and LIVE!!! <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showPrevMessage?topicID=2994.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showNextMessage?topicID=2994.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2994.topic&index=24><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/gfx/addReply1.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.emailToFriend?topicID=2994.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.threadControl?topicID=2994.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/deleteThreadFire.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=2994.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=2994.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub4.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="emarrmessageboardrules">Message Board Rules<option value="emarrlinks">Links<option value="emarrupcomingmmorpgs">Upcoming MMOG's<option value="emarrfrm18">America Under Attack<option value="emarrfrm19">Dark Age of Camelot<option value="emarrgeneral">General<option value="emarrfrm17">Funny Stuff<option value="emarrbazaar">Item Bazaar<option value="emarrscrollsnspells">Spell Bazaar<option value="emarrfrm15">Shiny Things<option value="emarrfrm14">Bargain Basement<option value="emarrdragonsandplanes">Rants and Flames<option value="emarrfrm13">Dragons and Planes<option value="emarrroleplaying">Roleplaying<option value="emarrroleplayingoocforum">Roleplaying - OOC Forum<option value="emarrscammeralert">Scammer Alert<option value="emarrsignaturecorner">Test Forum<option value="emarrreallife">Real Life<option value="emarrothermmorpgs">Other MMOG's</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#E9D756>- </font><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/bemarr>Erollisi Marr, The Queen of Love</a><font color=#E9D756> - </font><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes>Rants and Flames</a> <font color=#E9D756> - </font><br><br> <br>
