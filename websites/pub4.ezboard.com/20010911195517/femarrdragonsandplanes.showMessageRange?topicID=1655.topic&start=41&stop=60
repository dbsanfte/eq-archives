Sure, I got a bit heated in some of them and did some name calling but at least I laid out my issues.<br>
<br>
All you have done is call me names and laugh about the issue at hand while refusing to even try to answer it.<br>
<br>
I'll lay it out in an easier to read format and maybe you can actually answer some of my questions rather than just insult me. (Feel free to insult me while you answer, but at least answer).<br>
<br>
1.  I was kiting Fay while waiting for people to arrive(I had enough to kill him easily).  DG refused to back off based on doing a /who on my guild name.  So apparently I'm not allowed to bring non-guild people to help me kill Fay.  I also sent tells to at least two DG members who basically told me tough luck.<br>
<br>
Actually that's pretty much it.  DG came into Tim Deep and laid claim to a mob that I was kiting until my people could arrive and refused to back off.  Why?  Answer that.<br>
<br>
And here are my logs of conversations with DG about the subject:<br>
<br>
[Thu Feb 22 13:25:09 2001] You say out of character, 'fay is spoken for'<br>
[Thu Feb 22 13:25:28 2001] Alarick says out of character, 'spoken for?'<br>
[Thu Feb 22 13:25:31 2001] You say out of character, 'I am currently kiting him'<br>
[Thu Feb 22 13:25:37 2001] Alarick says out of character, 'dot him'<br>
[Thu Feb 22 13:25:39 2001] You say out of character, 'waiting for my group to arrive'<br>
[Thu Feb 22 13:26:03 2001] Scopullus tells you, 'hope you get fay dear =)'<br>
[Thu Feb 22 13:26:12 2001] You told Scopullus, 'thanks scoppie =)'<br>
[Thu Feb 22 13:26:16 2001] You told Scopullus, 'will dg back off?'<br>
[Thu Feb 22 13:26:33 2001] Scopullus tells you, 'they discussing it now =('<br>
[Thu Feb 22 13:26:40 2001] Scopullus tells you, 'trying to talk them out'<br>
[Thu Feb 22 13:26:47 2001] Scopullus tells you, 'doesnt look like =('<br>
[Thu Feb 22 13:26:57 2001] You told Scopullus, 'I have a raid coming and it's first kite rules'<br>
[Thu Feb 22 13:27:04 2001] Scopullus tells you, '=('<br>
<br>
[Thu Feb 22 13:34:16 2001] You told nocturne, 'Noct, I have him and people will come help me if DG backs off'<br>
[Thu Feb 22 13:34:56 2001] Nocturne tells you, ':(( they wont back off jae ;( they have loads on the way and they see you have no one ;(('<br>
<br>
[Thu Feb 22 13:35:37 2001] You told Nocturne, 'I have people I just cant get them here in 2 minutes'<br>
[Thu Feb 22 13:36:08 2001] Nocturne tells you, ':( theyre forming groups already :('<br>
<br>
[Thu Feb 22 13:42:33 2001] You told nocturne, 'nice to know how some guilds do things'<br>
[Thu Feb 22 13:43:19 2001] Nocturne tells you, 'im sorry jae ;( we did mention you. but they wont accept it. they say 1 person doesnt count as reserving it ;(('<br>
[Thu Feb 22 13:44:01 2001] You told Nocturne, 'Noct I need more than two minutes to put a raid together, I was in the process of doing it, you know it's bullshit just cause you can get there faster you get it?'<br>

<br>
Pulling quotes out of thin air now? Putting words in our mouth are we? If you bothered to read my post without pulling sentences out of context you'll notice I said we're sorry for not communicating on our first VS attempt, and like SF's first attempt I was under the impression we had to prove ourselves before getting in the rotation. The rotation for bigger mobs is a great idea, in no way do I want a race for uber mobs to occur. Surely we can work something out where we can get into the rotation and repay for the VS we &quot;stole&quot;. Nobody ever said &quot;fuck the rotation&quot; that's a twist you put on it yourself my friend. <br>

That's perfectly fine Jaeden.  Maybe it would help if some of these people were actually in the zone.  If you think it's fair that you greedily hold a mob for yourself for 2 hours (which is what it would've been to get them organised) then that's your opinion, personally i disagree.  <br>

I was not dead while I held those conversations and actually you did lay claim to him.  I asked if DG would back off so I could bring my people in and was told no.  I'm not going to waste the time of 24 people to come play lagfest football while your druid tries to take him from me and I try and take him back.  And yes, DG in a way did say we OWN him.  The only feedback I got while I was kiting him(and it's hard to type while running a dragon around) was tough luck, we're here and we're killing him.  I didn't die till I got fed up with trying to deal with you and attempted to gate out, unfortunately I didn't get far enough ahead of him.  <br>
<br>

<br>
US EST.  -5 hrs GMT.  And it was Thursday and the time may be off by an hour, my computer keeps adjusting for daylight savings even when I dont want it to.<br>
<br>
My whole point here is that DG wouldn't do me the courtesy of letting me bring my raid into the zone in peace and kill Fay.  I had to argue and eventually leave because you weren't going to.  IMHO that's the sign of a group of people that care about themselves more than others.<br>
<br>

<br>
Again, why do you presume to know how long it would take me to get people there.  And what's wrong with me running him around for an hour so that people can arrive to kill him?  Seriously, what is wrong with that?  He's going to die, what does it matter to you that it happens in 10 minutes or in an hour?  Answer?  It doesn't, the only thing that matters is the goal.  And on Thursday the goal was for DG to kill Fay no matter who they had to step on to do it. <br>
<br>
The reason I posted this in the VS thread was because it was appropriate.  You stepped on toes to get your shot as VS.  Just like you stepped on me to get to Faydedar.<br>

  Let me benefit a few of you with a clue to the VS spawn rotation.  I see a couple derogatory assaults towards the rotation as well as descriptive comments implying it as somehow demeaning and so forth.<br>
<br>
  If you are sitting back, reading this thread, and think you have an idea what happend... don't.  There are fairly imparticular hintings by some SF memebers at wrong doing with some light sparring from DG with a Fay thread running in the background.  I don't have a clue what really happend beyond DG slew VS during an SF week and there is no inherent evil in that statement.  If I really cared, and I don't since it's none of my business, I'd send a tell to Alarick, who is mentioned, and a couple SF officer types.<br>
<br>
  Let me get back to what I really want to discuss, though... ragging on the people who are trying to put a negative spin on a rotation system with clever words such as &quot;grovel&quot; and implying that Destian actually cares about what dropped from EMarr_VS106.<br>
<br>
  Rotation systems almost always go into effect from a hindsight perspective.  There has been a rotation system, of sorts, dating back to (if I had to guess) at least 9 months before Kunark (ie, Nag/Vox, Hate/Fear).  The reason rotations system exist is because having two guilds competiting for an end game resource (thereby requiring 24+ individuals from each guild to be present) is a mentally strenuous, physically tense, and emotionally trying situation.<br>
<br>
  In the olden days (sigh), this revolved more around two guilds bumping heads at the Fear portal.  Two guilds, 48 people, both guilds know you can't share the plane, both guilds know that break can be painfull, both want to focus on the task at hand and not have to worry about another guild pressuring them to hurry.  From my perspective, it's basically a hellish situation... to have to manage a raid and at the same time have 23 guildmates behind you foaming at the mouth for PC and NPC blood is simply overwhelming.<br>
<br>
  Look, I know I have partaken in my share of flames, but when it really all boils down to it I hope it is seen that I may go out of my way to be sarcastic, but I do not simply spill explitives to generate anger and I *do* attempt to display what I see as the honest truth.  The point of this admission is as follows... As much as you may read anger and hatred into what I've posted in the past, I have no intention of creating a situation which runs deep into the redline of emotional stress day after day.  When MS and DK have been present in the same zones to compete for an uber mob, I know I am uncomfortable and despite the ease of demonifying the &quot;other side&quot; I know many of them hate it as well.  I have no desire to put myself through the stress of an FFA situation day after day, nor do I have any desire to put a competing guild through the same displeasure.<br>
<br>
  It's a *huge* waste of time in a game this large to have two major forces compete over the same goal when the competition is invariably ugly.  To even describe the situation as involving two guilds anymore is incredibly simplistic.  Are there six VS capable guilds now?  18 minimum-ish turnout per attempt... 108 representatives from the collective guilds.  One hundred and eight additional people in Karnor's to fight and struggle over the lastest pop of VS.  Sounds very pleasurable, no?  And that 108 is just DG, imagine if the other 5 guilds came, too!  (Sorry, had to do it, any guild with 185 members deserves a good ribbing).<br>
<br>
  Before you knock a rotation system, try living the high end game without the damn system and you will quickly understand.  It's rather easy to complain from your KC pickup group about the injustice taking place inside the system, but it's also kinda like complaining that people on welfare get too many food stamps while you sit in your EZchair playing EQ, drinking Bud Light and munching Moonpies like some kind of human beanbag.<br>
<br>
  I've already typed way to much and now really don't feel like going into hypotheticals about how the system works and how no one gets screwed.  Beyond saying that it's really damn simple and is built on motives of respect and reducing stress, I'll just leave it at that.<br>

The Rotation -- Maeghant's post describes exactly what it is and why it's there and I (and anyone else with some sense) agree.  As far as *grovelling* etc.. this is from the people who don't see it's for others to decide whether they can do something or not.  People who control their own lives.  Although it is simpler, more polite and generally much less stressful, it's the principal of it <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I can assure you DG do respect the rotation but you can't expect people who aren't part of it to work with it.

I can't speak on those topics because they aren't the same thing.  Basically all you have done is dance around the subject and ignore the real issue at hand.  I was there kiting Fay so he did not depop until the people I had called could get there and get organized.  DG refused to acknowledge this fact and were prepared to take him from me.<br>
<br>
Pyra, you should be a politician because you are EXCELLENT at putting a spin on things that have nothing to do with the original topic.  Yet again, you have avoided the real topic.  You've got my vote.<br>

  /sigh grow up children.  If your guild wants a shot at Trakanon or Venril ( the only two mobs that I'm aware are on a rotation at this time) then speak to the guilds involved... at this time, thats Umoja / Storm's Fury / Midnight's Sojourn on Trak, and Da`Kor / Storm's Fury / Midnight's Sojourn on Venril I -think-.  I reserve the right to be wrong.  Send a tell to a member of the guild asking to speak to an officer about it... they should be able to tell you who to contact.<br>
<br>
  The only reason we do a rotation is to remove the stress and bitching that a FFA mode gives on these mobs.  And besides, do you REALLY want to bet you could beat us on any given day to a spawn?  Keep in mind, both DK and MS could beat us to the dragons 10 times out of 10 before they went to Kiddy Ride status, and that we're pretty goddamn organised.  <br>
<br>
Grovelling doesn't come into it, although politeness does.  <br>
<br>
  Storm's Fury is really only worried about teeth from Trakanon and epic drops from VS.  The other loot is nice, but if those others weren't there we'd abandon both those mobs in about 5 seconds flat... well, maybe not Trakanon, he's still fun.  But Venrils just a pain in the ass.  The fact that Verant made Venril the focal point for not one, not two, but THREE damn epics means he's going to be camped for a long, long time.  A rotation at least means you'll get a garaunteed shot.  Going FFA means you're going up against the guilds currently in the rotation, and hey!  Guess what!<br>
<br>
  -IF- someone sufficiently annoyed us by ignoring the rotation system we could just as easily decide to form an alliance for VS and take him with members from DK, MS and SF.  You really want to bet that you could beat such a force to the punch?<br>
<br>
  Not saying that would happen, but it's a possiblity.  Rotation = fair shot for everyone.  And, trust me... once we have what we need from these mobs we WILL move on.  <br>
<br>
