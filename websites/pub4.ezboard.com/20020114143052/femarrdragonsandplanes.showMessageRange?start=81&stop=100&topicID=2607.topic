 Re: Story<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
 Has anyone else noticed that there seems to be more squabbling about loot on raids going after the minor dragons than on any other type of raid? I can remember this stuff happening ever since I first starting paying attention to dragon raids, and that was a long time ago. I think it's because (1) so many of the people who go on those raids are either new to raids or obsessed with getting uber loot for their twinks, and (2) the loot from the minor dragons (such as dragon haste) is a lot more valuable than the loot that most people in their high 40s have ever seen before.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I'd suggest that you post your loot rules somewhere in advance. If someone new wants to join your raid, tell them to go read the loot rules. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> If they don't like the rules, they can either suck it up or leave.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> If you wait to get everyone buffed and in the chat room before laying out the loot rules, you're inviting an argument at a time when everyone needs to be focused on the business of killing the dragon.<br>
<br>
Yeah, people will still argue. But you can respond, &quot;The rules are posted, you had a chance to read them, end of story.&quot;  <br>
</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>

<br>
If this is true, why should the rules be challenged? Suck it up, leave, or don't sign on. Yes?  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ujexielia.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Jexielia</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_magentaspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 236<br> <font color=#E9D756>(11/2/01 10:27:30 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.angelfire.com/rpg/eqdragonsoffate/images/calvin.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Bored</span><hr size=1> <font color=yellow>Quit picking on this little juvenile maggot, Torm.

No, of course not.  Pretty much everyone who has posted in this thread seems to be in agreement with what I said in that old post.  Other than giving Snuggums the opportunity to misspell hypocrisy again, you added nothing to the discussion.<br>
<br>
For that matter, Vetinari's original post is consistent with what I said in my old post.  He didn't go on one of Jex's raids and then start bitching about the loot rules.  Instead, he said right up front that he wouldn't attend the raid with those loot rules.  He didn't even start the argument -- Jex's int caster pals did that.<br>
<br>
My beef with Jex isn't that she's using a stupid loot rule.  Who cares if she is?  She'll be old news before long, and someone else will be running dragon raids.  Instead, my beef with her is that she threw a juvenile hissy fit and started this thread as a personal egofest.  I've said that several times in this thread, but of course that's too complicated a concept for mental giants like Jex and Snuggums. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/usagemonprayeth.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sagemon Prayeth</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 170<br> <font color=#E9D756>(11/3/01 6:37:43 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Bored</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> And, Sagemon, I still dont know why you have such a problem with all of this and I seriously dont know why the tension is so intense... but get off of it, this debate is going no where fast. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

You seriously don't know why the tension is so intense?  Vet is one of the nicest, most laid back guys on the server.  You called him an assbucket and a greedy lootmonger (or whatever the exact phrase was), then started a thread on this board with his name in the title.

<br>
It amazes me that you are *this* moronic Jex.  You're refusing to see what on earth is going on.  This was a discussion on DRAGON LOOT RULES, most specifically, yours.  The question that is constantly being asked, and avoided by you to boot, is why are you allowing the INT casters and not the WIS casters on the scale?  You are giving INT casters the opportunity to random on 2 nice items and giving the WIS casters a bone by allowing them on the same eyepatch they have to random against on the INT casters.  <br>
<br>
Lets just face it dearie, your loot rules were messed up.  That scale should go to the bards .. it's their epic piece and standard loot rules dictate those override anything else.  Granted, that is not set in stone, but you should not give preference to one group over another .. i.e. the INT casters over the WIS casters.  Sure, you can sit there in your little helmet eating paste and say &quot;well I'm a wis caster and I don't get to random on it and it's my raid&quot; .. whoopdefuckingdo.  You don't speak for all WIS casters, just your namby pampy little self.<br>
<br>
The bottom line is this .. don't like the rules, don't go.  However, when you post your stuff up, it makes you fair game for criticism.  Get used to it if you ever plan to lead an actual real raid other than dragons.  Dragons are cake next to the Planes.  You of course can't see that right now because you think you can just waltz into a Plane and lead it.  Sorry dear, you're not in one of the high level guilds who can do that .. you're here with the rest of us.  <br>
<br>
The other thing is (and this is honest advice, so don't take it as a flame), you're really not doing yourself much good here by continuing to flail your arms about on this whole Vox loot deal.  <br>
<br>
If you intend to truly go out and lead the Plane raids, you don't want to be remembered as the dragon pharmer who screamed about loot.  You want people to confidently follow you to these Planes.  Have we (Sagemon, Vetinari and myself .. we lead regular Plane raids that are very well attended) ever screwed up?  Hell yes we have .. we've had to have one raid rescued by Divine Grace, TSS and Clan Autumnwood (a few members from each) .. that was when Fear went terribly wrong.  It hasn't since then, fortunately.  What you're not realizing is you're pissing all over people who can give you valuable advice on how to lead successful pick up raids, past the dragon years.   Do you think that the other pick up raid leaders aren't reading your antics?  You'd be mistaken.  We all read it .. we just may not all post on the topic.  <br>
<br>
Why should you bother giving any bit of respect to these other raid leaders?  Because sweetums, one day you're going to run into them.  How?  Do you think that these other raid leaders dont' help each other out if we get into a jam? We most certainly do! What if you have a raid scheduled right around the time another raid does?  Lets say, you have a Hate raid scheduled for 9am Sunday morning .. and lets say, Sage, Vet and I have a raid scheduled for 8am Sunday morning.  Our normal practice is that we don't jump anyone's raids and if we're aware of a raid going close to our timeslot, we find alternate plans or we work something out.  We've done it with many people, so this isn't something I'm pulling out of my ass to make a point.  Many of the other pick up raid leaders work in a similar fashion, including the ones in the large guilds.   We've seen guilds give up the planes so we could go and we have done the same for them.  <br>
<br>
The moral of the story .. be careful who you're shitting all over because one day, you may need them.  <br>
<br>
Now, will you finally answer the damn questions?!!?<br>

*laugh* The planes aren't that hard either, well maybe if you only have one enchanter, one cleric, and a main tank who's pulling. But that's if you want a challenge. And yes I've done this. Have you? Saying that the Planes are tough and require some kind of drivers liscence or you need to pass the bar exam to get to the front door is comical at best.

So far what i've gathered from this thread (didnt read all of it in order) Vet didnt like Jex's rules and let her know, he mighta been rude about it but i dunno. Jex comes and posts here about him then it turns into a big flame fest, thats why Vet's friends are pissed, not cuz her loot rules. Anyway.....<br>
<br>
Jex we all know its your raid, your rules, but from what i gather, you're leaving out wis casters because they have other items to roll on,  yes ? That doesnt make too much sense IMO.....two rusty swords dont make up for a ykesha (you get the idea) If your raiders have complaints let them deal with it, if they dont, then thats that.<br>
<br>
<br>
Torm, Sage, anyone else arguing about it......its not gonna do any good (probly like my post here) if you think her attitude is gonna bite her on the ass later....good, let it, she's a big girl and she can try and deal with it then.<br>
<br>
One last thing, I've never led/helped lead a dragon raid ever, but i have been on some pick-up dragon raids, and i would think getting enough people with the right resists to throw at the dragon would be harder than a plane raid. Correct me if im wrong but i remember people on this board thinking 18 person dragon raids were supposed to be bare minimum..........I used to raid hate and fear ALOT pre-velious, and 12-18 people was the average number. Maybe PoG is different, i've never fought there ever, but i hear its so easy a warrior can pull up there. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/bemarr.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=darikan>Darikan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 13<br> <font color=#E9D756>(11/3/01 12:10:29 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> let it end</span><hr size=1> Everyone needs to just stop.

Torm you really need to be quite, every time you post you just make yourself look even more stupid.  <br>
<br>
Sage leave her alone.  This section of the board is meant for this.  If you want to defend vet then fine that is appropriate but to tell jex she is a bitch for posting a rant or flame is stupid.  She has that right and this is the proper forum to do it in.<br>
<br>
As for plane raids being more difficult.  No.  They really aren't.  You need smarter people because one screw up there kills the raid but that doesn't make it harder to understand.  Jex after you have been to the planes a few times and you lead your first raid there...I will be there with ya.<br>
<br>
Everyone else we are pretty much in agreement that it is her raid her rules and that should be enough.  Let this thread die and lets all go on our happy way.  It's time to quit arguing over loot rules.  The raid leader sets them if you don't like it you don't go.  We all know this we all live with this.<br>

Darikan, you don't get to tell people what to post on the R&amp;F board.  This little maggot may be your friend, but she becomes fair game when she starts a flame on this board. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ujexielia.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Jexielia</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_magentaspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 238<br> <font color=#E9D756>(11/4/01 8:54:31 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.angelfire.com/rpg/eqdragonsoffate/images/calvin.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: let it end</span><hr size=1> Sage ~ It's funny how when someone proves you to be a dweeb, you have to go and rag on them for their spelling errors, since you can find no other way to make yourself look intelligent, and trust me, that doesnt help.  Oh, and I may be a maggot but what is it that they say????... oh yeah "takes one to know one"  <br>
<br>
Torm ~ You, Sage, and Vet are NOT the only people in this game who know how to run raids.  If and when I begin doing plane raids you bet your ass I'll have people there backing me up... be it my guild, my friends, friends of my friends or so on... people are NOT going to say "OMG dont help Jex she was the one with the fucked up loot rules who led Vox in October/November of 2001 who argued with Sage & co. on the message boards!!!" So dont worry about me darling, I'll be just fine.  <br>
<br>
And perhaps even someday we'll all end up in the same zone fighting together with the same purpose and you'll realize that this whole argument was completely worthless, childish, and not worth it in the first place.<br>
<br>
My loot rules are, were, and always will be FINE... and just like stated before:  if you dont like it dont go... and in this case: if you dont like it, keep your mouth shut and let the people who do like it go and have thier fun.<br>
<br>
Snuggums ~ you're cool too =)<br>
<br>
Darikan ~ Right on!  Look forward to fighting with ya sweetie.<br>
<br>
Everyone else ~ =)<br>
<br>
That is all... Im done with this argument, it's just getting completely retarded, and I know you'll all post again with your smart words of wisdom, and I look forward to reading them... but I have no reason to respond to another thing you guys say.  And perhaps, just maybe, you guys will grow up and drop it too.<br>
<br>
Have a wonderful day =)<br>

My ability to spell the word surprise has little to do with the fact that you have yet to respond with the requested quote, when you said this:-<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Read the whole quote by Vetinari, Sharasali. Or is that just too much effort for you? And Jex still admits that it wasn't an insult. Read the part of the quote from Jex's post that you didn't highlight.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
I read the entire post several times and the only thing I found was one small passage that had relevence, but did not support your claim. So I asked you for what quote you were refering to. You failed to respond.<br>
<br>
This is a pattern for you. Whenever you start to argue something, and someone asks you for proof, you ignore them until everyone badgers you about it, and then you argue that you dont need to give proof, all the while giving petty insults. And then if someone responds to your insults, you seem to feel justified in them. -shrugs-<br>
<br>
As for my:-<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> reading comprehension&gt;you<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
comment, I was not being insulting. It was a general comment, because you seemed to have totally missed some words in Jexielia, and thus formed the basis of your arguement on nothing.<br>

I have / will NOT read this whole post ... I have read about 1/2 of it. Here is what I have to say:<br>
<br>
1) I am Sorry! I think/feel that I have Started this whole thing!<br>
I talked to jexie about int casters getting to loot/roll on scale. and I didnt give her a break about it. I kept on. <br>
<br>
2)The ppl that are the main posters here are all my friends, and I care about all of them, Jexie, Sage, Tormy, and although I dont know Vet that well I have seen him and he is always nice to me. I hate to see ppl. friends ... yelling back and forth like "My brothers kids or something". I dont like the harsh bashing from any of you! This is not productive.<br>
<br>
3)Sage your first post was a flame, yes yes we are in a flame board but, I would have liked to seen you offer up suggestions to Jexie, she is very nice, funnie, and outgoing, as YOU are a great Raid leader that I think anyone could learn from. You responded to her cuz of your friends =) and I know that and can understand it =)<br>
~~~ IF anyone knows Sage they know his raids go very well and are fun as well, and they are very fair as to loot rules, as I have seen somepeople get a harsh taste of what a REAL raid is -=as far as pickup raids/non"UBER" guild raids=- from him and dont goto raids that have the success he does. Further some of his raids go a TON more than some guild raids do ~~~<br>
<br>
4) Look on the other side of things too guys, Jexie is a wis caster ... if she said wis casters get to roll too .. what is the first thing ppl would say ... you are a wis caster you are a LOOT whore... The robe has more INT than wis and wis casters get to roll on other things if they drop. I think this was her thoughts.<br>
<br>
5)I have always said that a GUILD dont make a person or represent the person wearing a Tag. As far as UBER guilds go, all that really comes to mind is a song ... "I was born in a small town ..." IF you Flame and you always have something to say that is hotheaded ppl see that. Know when enough is enough and when to let things drop. State your mind and put your heart into it... dont speak from your ass. dont post shallow things like SoN`so is a Jackass .. now to call someone a CRACKHEAD! is a lil differant and funnie =) ... Sage is admirable to because He says what he thinks .. and if it makes someone mad or upset he gives two shits, this is a way of life for him, he so chooses not to go with the croud or be involved in things he does not want to be, his friends mean alot to him and he sticks by them with vingence. he is noble and dependable. I have seen this for myself .. so you say what you will. Jexie is a very kind hearted person that really tries to be nice and goes out of her way to help ppl and have fun. Torm and Vet =) they are good ppl(.) I dont care what Vet says about you Torm ... I still like ya =) .... if you are going to flame atleast offer up a compermise / or a clear reason as to why and how you think/feel<br>
<br>
I hope this lightens your guys' hearts and you chat IG about things .. maybe get things lil clearer. As to a means of ends .... I think we ALL can agree that You lead, you set the rules(.)<br>
