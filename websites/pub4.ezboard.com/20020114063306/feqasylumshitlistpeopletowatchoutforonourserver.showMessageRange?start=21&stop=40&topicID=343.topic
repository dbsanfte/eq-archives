They petitioned a GM as well, to ask about the gloves. We all know Verant does little to uphold honor, it's all about policies and technicalities to them. Every single GM or Guide that wants to stay a GM or Guide HAS to abide by policy. <br>
<br>
The 'threats' made against your guild, as you see them, hold true. The gloves are in Jesy's possession, and the person who killed the mob, and had intended to loot them, for whatever reason they wished, DID NOT give consent for the person to have the gloves. <br>
<br>
Screw Verants' rules, screw policy. We have our own policy, and taking items from someone wrongfully is a bad thing. The solution is easy...<br>
<br>
Give them a choice, the gloves or the guild? <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ujekakiril.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Jeka Kiril</A> at: 12/27/00 5:06:02 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/utardaan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tardaan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>p0\/\/3r-p0sT3r!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(12/27/00 6:04:30 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Jesy, bard and dishonest thief of guild U.P.O.N</span><hr size=1> A EQ player can't make &quot;threats&quot; to another player about banning/suspending.  These are in their own domain bannable/suspendable.  As far as threats of blacklisting a guild based on one person's actions, it's a bit hard to do.  I am willing to bet 75% (maybe more) of the server could give a rat's ass.  Also, I have been told by a GM in the past: once the exclusive looting time limit has past for the person/group that killed a mob and someone else loots it...too bad. <p><center>Tardaan Lonewolff<br>

If this jesy person didn't loot the things for Kit to give to someone else then why did he follow her to the person who was supposed to recieve them.<br>
<br>
I know Kit, he has been on numerous raids with me and is nothing less than honorable. Period.<br>
<br>
As for Jesy, you guys better talk to this clown before you get a shitty reputation for &quot;OK'ing&quot; stupid moves by your guildmates. You may find yourselves being declined for major raids due to your guilds reputation for being less than honorable.<br>
<br>
And Kit, as for the gloves. Fuck em if they won't give em back. I will be happy to go camp the Orc and get you another pair.<br>

Yet there are others who have shown other not-so-nice things Jesy has done. Where are all the NONE guildies who can stand up for Jesy honorbility. Also even the guildmembers mentioned that they dont know Jesy well. <br>
<br>
Just my 2 cents... I have had many dealings with GMS (some good some bad) and just because the say something doesnt make it right. And just because someone is in your guild doesn't instantly make them honorable. Not judging anyone since I dont know them... but find if odd nothing good is relly being said about Jesy... his own guild officers save.. what was that one... say they even really know him yet defend him. <br>
<br>
And I agree Wysp is a cutie.. and a real sweetie... cant see he being friends with someone who would lie about it. SO maybe it is honor by association, but I am kinda leaning towards the opriginal poster on this... and if I come across this bard I will be sure to watch them to see what I think. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ukitkoran.showPublicProfile?language=EN>kitkoran</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>n00b!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(12/27/00 3:32:04 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Jesy, bard and dishonest thief of guild U.P.O.N</span><hr size=1> hmm lets try this again lol.its kinda like starting a line telling the first person and waiting till it gets to the last to see what is ended up said lol...FIRST,i never claimed that all of UPON are bad apples just the one and its leadership ethics...SECOND,whoever says that the gloves where offered back is a BOLDFACE liar..i told both guildleaders becuase they sit next to each other in RL as husband and wife that if he just returned the item he would still get his payment as agreed and all would be dropped..i even asked people that were giving her a hard time about it to back off cause they were not involved in the dispute other than witnesses and had no reason being rude to her...no item was ever offered back..instead all i got was GM says its ok and i have to believe my member over you and people i dont know la dee da da...well if he would have just done the right thing in the first place he would never have been mentioned to anyone but my own guildmembers.THIRD, i never please read carefully claimed that gm were on my side for anything..i stated that the gm's could not do anything because i gave jesy permission to loot corpse after the 3 minute timer..the ONLY reason they did nothing is because of an EQ rule teqnicallity that after 3 minutes unless otherwise stated anyone has the right to loot a corpse..this does not make it moral or ethical..its just a simple rule they have to follow...now by me giving him permission to loot the corpse &quot;after making an agreement &quot;but&quot; before the timer was out makes it simple..once again IT ALL BOILS DOWN TO THIS---he made an agreement to carry item for payment,,he carried the item to its destination,then refused to hand over item...now as for me calling a gm sure i did..&quot;after&quot; jesy had already told me he had already talked to one and got permission to keep the item and told me if i wanted proof to speak with the gm which i did...question, why would someone immediately call a gm and ask permission to keep an item that did not come from a mob they did not kill AND while they were still with that person that did kill it? anyways im tired of going on with this..ya can make up any excuse you want for this guy but it all comes to the same conclusion, he made a deal,,he broke the deal by not returning an item that didnt belong to him..in my book thats dishonesty and thievery and is all i have claimed on the blacklist and nothing else..its a plain and simple warning to others..oh yah guildwar? aye i mentioned it would be cool..it kinda fits in roleplay one guild dishonering a member of another..i also mentioned i would have to speak with people about it..not like i can initiate it not being an officer duh....one more thing i know shut up heh,,all these officers who say they spoke with me..shutup..you didnt..i only have spoken to 3 officers..the initial guy who was very polite and kind and offered to research the mess,and the 2 main leaders..which also were kind  till the end..so stop posting that you know this and that if you do not know what was said or was even there...btw if anyone can ell me how to retrieve chatlog from hardisk id be glad to find where he made agreement and everything and post it for you <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uagean.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Agean</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>w4nn4b3!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(12/27/00 4:54:46 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://home.earthlink.net/~moongaze/_uimages/AgeanPic.bmp WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Jesy, bard and dishonest thief of guild U.P.O.N</span><hr size=1> I'll try to say this as tactfully as possible...

<br>
and i am not defending what he did or saying it was right but i do have concerns about who is lieing and who is telling the truth nobody will ever truely know<br>
<br>
a few things i want to make clear <br>
<br>
first i questioned you kit and you had a diffrent response for me when asked the same question in a diffrent ways. so either your a liar or you don't know what all happened.<br>
<br>
this leads me to not put full faith in your story like i told you. from the very begining i was the one who told you that there was very little i can do in this matter. that i would talk to jesy and get his side of the story. and see what i can do <br>
<br>
this i did he tells me a complete diffrent story and says your lieing and he offered to give the gloves back. <br>
<br>
and i tryed to help you the best i could i talked to both sides now i can't prove your story and i can't prove his all i can do is make a judgement call on what i do know and that is there isn't enough proof to act on at this time. <br>
<br>
but one other thing i also want to say you did in fact start to make threats at me and my guild cause i did't give you everything you wanted you then started telling me how there were 3 gms ready to back you up and the head admin was one of them. this is a fact and you know it but thats does't matter just don't come on here and lie about it <br>
<br>
another thing you yourself told me you did't want me to remove him from the guild so i ask you this what the hell am i supose to do.<br>
<br>
I ask all you to put your self in my shoes acording to my webmaster who logs registered members i have 185 guild members to think about. i try my best to please eveyone but thats not possable what i did was the only thing i can do i will not punish somebody who is acused of a crime that i can't prove and i dont think any guild leader would.<br>
<br>
so here it is what would you have done kit i put you in my shoes you say i am a bad guild leader i put you in my shoes your now the leader of 185 people and this prob comes up you tell me what you will do to make everyone happy i am eager to hear and anyone else feel free to respond maybe if your idea is good i will do it<br>

P.S. i am the guild leader Mistymoon is my wife she is an officer not leader the second guild leader of Upon is Askari she holds the title of co guild leader passed to her by Qenani who was granted it by the GM at my request <br>
and on a side note if you want your guild war get your leader to send me or my wife a tell set a time and place and we will be there <br>

Kit did the right thing to talk to the guild leaders and than it is up to them how they want to handle the situation.  It is not for us to come in and Judge the entire guild based on one persons actions, and we also have to trust that the Guild leader did everything he could do.  Like he said he listened to 2 sides than did the best he could.He even asked for suggestions on what you think could be done under the circumstances because jesy's side appears to be different from Kit's. Who is lying Kit? or Jesy? none of us know we were not there. I would be pretty upset if someone called me a liar and my guild just disbanded me based on what they said without investigating the situation the best they could. I am here because I happen to know Mistymoon and have known her to be very honest and trustworthy. I Have also participated in some raids with thier guild and have had nothing but GOOD dealing with any of their members, so I am only here to defend the guild from the name calling and dishonoring of thier guild because someone has an issue with one person. I have grouped with many of them and it was need before greed always.  Now I am not defending Jesy because I never personally grouped with him I am only saying that I disagree with the posts here that are flaming an entire guild, even so far to say the leaders are Liars too. Let Kit post her concerns here she deserves it and let Jesy respond to this with his side of the story and lets stop accusing the entire guild of being dishonest.<br>
That is my 2 coppers worth.<br>

I have been trying to find a way to solve this prob contray to what kit claims i have talked to my officers about it i also contacted a good friend about it Simc and we both agreed that him takeing the gloves was wrong and i should have handled it diffrently what we concluded was <br>
<br>
1 can't prove kits story <br>
2 i can't prove jesy's story<br>
3 only thing i can prove is who killed the mob<br>
4 there for we concluded that i would get the gloves  from jesy and return them myself this way i can be the one who does it and if they are refused it is me that gets refused and not somebody telling me they were. <br>
<br>
here is were the truth starts to come out<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
after talking with Simc i contact jesy and ask him for the gloves after a long while i get him to talk his response was that he is going to get the head gm for the server to brodcast that the gloves are his and the matter is solved. <br>
<br>
I then tried to explain to him that yes the gloves are his by game rules but not by honor there not there for the only honorable thing to do is return them to me so taht i can give them to her and end this whole thing. <br>
<br>
well i am sad to report that i never receved another tell from jesy but i did read a tell he sent to my wife saying that he would just destroy the glvoes he did't need all the drama. <br>
<br>
Now comes the realy hard part <br>
<br>
First off i would like to apoligize on behalf of my guild at the time i did all i could do and i still stand by my decisions yes i prob should have handled things diffrently but i did't for that i will face the consenquence of my actions. <br>
<br>
As for jesy he has been booted from my guild and shal be blackballed from all our raids and joint raids for bring this dishonor to our guild <br>
<br>
I also would like to state one fact thos involved know what happend and there was alot of lies told on this board about what happend and i put this to you is not lieing about the facts jsut as bad as what was done. if it had not resorted to threats this whole mess prob would never happened <br>
<br>
I don't take threats i dont' back down and will fight to the death with anyone anywere anyplace that wants to threaten me or my family thats in life and in game. if you would have acted civil to me and not resorted to makeign threats on me and my guild this could have been sorted out but you chose to make threats and lies toward us to get what you wanted i have apoligized for what i did and for what jesy did i can't control every member of a guild nor can you i am sure your guild leader will agree with me on that one but i feel that you owe me and my guild an apoligie for your remarks made toward us <br>

<br>
Quit making them. You still cannot alter the issue. Gloves that were taken wrongfully. The stem of the problem. A greedy person who refused to return upon request from the person whom was the rightful owner of the gloves.<br>
<br>
Tardaan...do you see any GMs on this board? Are there any GMs posting under their GM names? Do they claim to be current GMs and are making current judgements and decisions?<br>
<br>
The answer is no. This is the community, and we abide by our own rules. What a GM says and  what Verant says are irrelevent in situations like these. <br>
<br>
I would rather be aware of someone on my server that I could not trust to give high value items to, than to one day be wronged by that person because of my own ignorance. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uaandolinbloodstorm.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aandolin Bloodstorm</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>n00b!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(12/28/00 7:17:59 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: this is all thats new on my part </span><hr size=1> I certainly hope that this can be the end of this issue.  I am usually just a lurker on these boards, but I wanted to chime in that I was proud to be invited in UPON after seeing repeated instances of their honorable and generous behavior in many situations.  I have only been a member for a month, but I have seen guildchat filled with nothing but folks helping others, both in guild and outside.  The guild members I have grouped with make it a point to be the last ones left behind to die with the baddies while others escape.  I'm sure there are bad apples in every guild (keep in mind we're pushing 200 members), but we really do try to police our own.  I hope it is some small comort to know that our guild leaders were truly troubled and conflicted on how to handle this issue, and it was contemplated with the utmost seriousness.  I can not speak for my whole guild, but I can state that I will redouble my efforts to behave in a manner that will bring honor to UPON. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/utardaan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tardaan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>p0\/\/3r-p0sT3r!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(12/28/00 8:21:58 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Jesy, bard and dishonest thief of guild U.P.O.N</span><hr size=1> I wouldnt say Verant/GM input on incidents like this to be null and void.  With the proper proof, many items have been given back to their rightful owners by the lead GMs.  What is done is done.  I hope Jesy enjoys the bed they have made for themselves.. <p><center>Tardaan Lonewolff<br>

I'm disappointed you didn't stand up and face this at least to uphold the honor of the guild...sad.<br>
<br>
...to Kit, for training all that public criticism and disrespect on a group of good people to get even with one individual...I think less of you.<br>
<br>
...to Namin et al for handling this in an honorable manner. Thanks for not being hasty under enormous pressure, objectively trying to get at the truth, for not stooping to Kit's or Jesy's level, and for doing the only honorable thing left as a choice for the guild as a whole. This was not easy for you but once again you have demonstrated why we are proud to have you as leader of UPON. Guess this is a case where the need of the many outweighs the need of the one...a sober time. I salute you.<br>
