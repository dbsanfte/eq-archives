<br>
Thank you for providing your log. That puts things into a very proper perspective. I noticed that that following were looted:<br>
<br>
[Sat Apr 06 17:17:14 2002] --Moredith has looted a Diamond.--<br>
[Sat Apr 06 17:17:15 2002] --Moredith has looted a Ruby Crown.--<br>
[Sat Apr 06 17:17:18 2002] Midggett says, 'same'<br>
[Sat Apr 06 17:17:19 2002] Seanchans says out of character, 'Guluk needs rez, but he just went offline'<br>
[Sat Apr 06 17:17:22 2002] --Moredith has looted a Prayers of Life.--<br>
[Sat Apr 06 17:17:26 2002] --Moredith has looted a Gauntlets of Fiery Might.--<br>
[Sat Apr 06 17:17:28 2002] --Moredith has looted a Red Dragon Scales.--<br>
<br>
So, I see five items. How many items typically drop off Naggy?<br>
<br>
Next, I noticed the following occured roughly a minute and half after Moredith looted:<br>
<br>
[Sat Apr 06 17:19:11 2002] Alderac says out of character, 'why is 60 druid looting?'<br>
[Sat Apr 06 17:19:14 2002] Irnar tells Naggy2:1, 'rez me i have a 90 rez'<br>
[Sat Apr 06 17:19:15 2002] Mayaserena tells the guild, 'Using my Quicker Clicker on Kikekrn now...'<br>
[Sat Apr 06 17:19:15 2002] Moredith says out of character, 'thats me'<br>
[Sat Apr 06 17:19:17 2002] Froog tells Naggy2:1, 'WHY IS DROOD LOOTING?'<br>
[Sat Apr 06 17:19:23 2002] Moredith tells Naggy2:1, 'the drood is me'<br>
<br>
Obviously, the druid Carathos began looting less than a minute and half after Moredith looted. So the question to have answered is... why? For the dragon body to have remained after the first five items were looted indicates that at least one additional item remained on the corpse - the pally book apparently. Could there have been any other items on the corpse or are six items the max that has been seen on Naggy from previous raids? Another question to ask is why not loot the pally book with Moredith while the other items were being looted?<br>
<br>
I would also like to see the portion of the log where Moredith announces the loot. I know that he announced the diamond, ruby crown, opal, prayers of life, red dragon scales, and guantlets of fiery might because I wrote down on my notepad those items when announced. I would like to see the time between the two log segments I quoted above and the segment for the loot announcement. Concerning the loot announcement, why was the pally book not announced and why was the opal added? I am virtually sure that I looted the opal from a fire giant and it is certainly verified that an opal was not looted by Moredith.<br>
<br>
Many questions. Moredith, please help me to understand these things.<br>

<br>
 I am impartial on the chardok matter.. if you know what weapon I currently use you know i did not need the dropped weapon. as far as a few of your statements go..<br>
<br>
"Only after the roll did people start complaining"<br>
<br>
False, both Lorce and Zak had a fit as soon as the numbers for randoms were called out with Carathos and the others listed.. The raid leader(Psyblade btw is not a she, at least ingame) did not call NBG prior so there was nothing they could do.<br>
<br>
"He is honest. He is definately not ebayed"<br>
<br>
 It has already been mentioned that Car is ebayed on another post, that's besides the point. The player evidentally at least played Moredith long enough to know what's going on, I only pointed out some of his actions that seemed questionable, because one of the melees that were at the raid appear to have the weapon now and claim purchase from Car.<br>
<br>
 No skin off my back.  What's done is done. But don't consider anyone a saint, we're all capable of evil.<br>
<br>
 I do agree on your raid tactics and have no problem with Moredith's frustration in that matter.. If people won't listen kill the raid or boot their asses out.. they're just gonna ruin it. <p>Moto Forgotten<br>

p.s. I still don't think carathos is ebayed, BUT how could I truly know...I wish they could stop ebaying for chars. Items are fine, but how would you feel if you trusted somone you thought you knew then found they were someone new.. In RL thats identity theft and is a crime lol.... BAH<br>

Some say he's and exsperienced raid leader. Why do i find this hard to believe? I haven't been to many dragon raids myself but i can tell you the difference of and experienced raid leader..If you are an experienced raid leader you are use to the stress the raid has given you therefore should not of bother you as bad as what you claim cause you should be use to it by now exspecially after 3yrs. Any exsperienced raid leader can tell you that. You should of stated your loot rules before the raid began and stated it more then once cause some ppl might not of got it the first time. That way if the book was intended for your guildie everybody would of known ahead of time and not of been so mad about it.. Let me tell you why i think he done this intentionally..<br>
1) You brung out your 60 lvl druid who was not grouped to loot the dragon? &quot; Oh that's just me &quot; you say . OMG that would of been enough for me to open up a can of whoop @$$. C'mon now dude , did you honestly think 40+ ppl were gonna be ok with this? Does that not look a bit sneaky? What are you trying to hide? I bet those questions crossed everyone's mind that night and you should of known this being an exsperienced raid leader and all.. Did you honestly think ppl weren't gonna get suspicious?<br>
2) You announced loot order in your group ? Now i can kinda understand how this would happen. But if you were doing your job correctly it should of been fixed right away. Every raid leader knows loot should be announced more than once, several times for that matter. There is always someone who forgets to say &quot; hey i want in on that roll.&quot; So i dont' understand how this wasnt' fixed right away. If you announced loot in your group and simply asked the question &quot; Am i forgetting someone? &quot; This problem would of been fixed right away cause your group would of been like you announced that in group nobody heard ya. But this didnt' happen and why to me does that seem so unfair ?<br>
3) You were very rude man =( <br>
REZZ ME NOW<br>
REZZ ME NOW<br>
REZZ ME NOW<br>
REZZ ME NOW<br>
Dang ! Could you not spam my screen any worse? Does anybody else find this rude but me? Them poor clerics =(<br>
Let me tell ya something man if i was your cleric i would or rezz'd you for the simple fact that you were raid leader but never again. And as for the rest of you spamming her poor screen you would of had long walks back to your corpses. That is so rude and disrespectful.<br>
You know i never met this guy, But is he really a nice person ? c'mon now this is eq ..How do you really know for sure? <br>

I just want to say that Carathos definitely ebayed (sometime around Christmas?) and the original Carathos was a really really really honorable player and a great guildmember.<br>
<br>
Considering:<br>
<br>
1) the guy didn't list the book (it's clear in the log, he didn't list the book)<br>
2) looted with an alt who was grouped with a bard who had been afk for at least 45 minutes<br>
3) the &quot;opal&quot;<br>
<br>
I believe this guy was out to screw the raiding party.<br>

However, upon viewing the looting process, I was<br>
pretty astonished at how inefficient it was.  I was one of 4 or 5 pallies on the raid that was composed of 48 people.  I was also the one who began to question the looting of the pally book while the devastaingly slow process of looting was going on.  I don't have a log of the event sadly and can only pledge my word on the events that had happened.<br>
I was previously on 3 vox raids before hitting naggy for the first time so I can claim a feel of what happens when the dragon dies.  One of which i was ported out of voxs lair before the loot process began, thus evaporating my chance on any loot.  Upset as I was not too much of a big deal to me, and I think I will live.<br>
<br>
On to the raid and what happened:  At this point i have no idea that his druid looted the book.<br>
<br>
Dragon died<br>
Moredith revived<br>
moredith loots dragon<br>
dragon still there<br>
carethos loots dragon<br>
everyone complains about druid looting dragon<br>
everyone calms down loot announced<br>
no pally book announced in loot<br>
scale auctioned first<br>
prelimanary list announced of names without numbers, 10 names<br>
roll of a six<br>
list of names announced to raid in exact order as previous with numbers added<br>
person who i am grouped with named Kandder wins scale<br>
kandder not affiliated with moredith in any way, he claims and i believe him<br>
people complain, moredith says he announced in group and appologizes<br>
I feel that this was done fairly in morediths defense<br>
<br>
more loot auctioned<br>
mention of a pally book dropping hits my ears, i get excited as i have 25% chance of getting it<br>
asked if a pally book drops, response from Moredith is yes<br>
mention of Harsh winning pally book<br>
I ask if it was rolled on and was I included<br>
no response<br>
I say I did not see a roll, did I miss it<br>
no response<br>
I ask how can a pally book be rewarded without a roll<br>
no response<br>
I ask how can you give out a pally book without rolling on it.<br>
no response<br>
I asked if the pally book was reserved for Harsh at the start of the raid, even though it was not posted on the board or mentioned in chat or at the start of the raid<br>
<br>
Moredith finally chimes up that he did a who all pally and rolled among the five pallies in the zone<br>
I ask was I included in that roll<br>
Moredith says yes and that Harsh won<br>
My final response<br>
I think you shafted 4 pallies out of the book, but that is just my opinion.<br>
<br>
Facts:<br>
Harsh was senior pally on raid if he actually gets the book chain quested, I am happy for him.<br>
No roll for the pally book was made visably to my sceen, either in zone or in raid channel<br>
pally book was not included in loot list, and only through prying did info on it become revealed<br>
dragon still there after moredith looted him<br>
druid carethos looted naggy, people concerned about this<br>
do i feel screwed.    Yes<br>
will I live.      yes<br>
will I  raid again with moredith, probably, only morediths first strike.  everyone deserves a second chance, unless of course you kill a member of MY Family, in that case you die unequivocally.<br>
<br>
just my two cents (more like 1,000,002 cents though)<br>

Sean, you know nothing so be quiet.  You have made no points just stated the facts.<br>
<br>
I had a conversation with Moredith the night before that makes this look really bad to me.<br>
<br>
I am in no way accusing Moredith of anything.  I believe this looks really bad and Moredith, you definately need to explain yourself here.  You have pissed alot of people off.  I am not one of them, but our convo the night before makes this look a whole lot worse.  I would rather talk to you in game.  I will look for you.<br>

<br>
Not sure why you picked my posts out of the 30 to rag on, but if you have a problem with me or my posts, deal with me about it. Concerning my not making points, just stating facts... I see nothing of substance in your post either. The last I heard, this was an open forum where anyone may post. Therefore, I'll post as I see fit and respect your right to post as well.<br>
<br>
This entire incident concerns me greatly. I've been a supporter of Moredith's for quite a while and still am, but there are definite questions that he should answer. I won't repeat the questions in this post, I posed them earlier. A final comment for you, Tulmarian. You stated that you had a prior conversation with Moredith the night before that makes this situation look really bad. Don't just make statements that hint at something wrong, either come out with the facts or keep the innuendos to yourself.<br>
<br>
That is "my" 2pp's worth.<br>

Looking back on it, I think Moredith made a mistake having his druid there, but I dont think that he was trying to be dishonest or ninja anything.  Im basing that simply on my experiences with him in tells/chat and the way he conducted the rest of the raid.  Im a little new at all this, with this being my main Charactor, and Moredith's, like all the people I have raided with, been extremely helpful to me.  Just my 2cp.<br>
