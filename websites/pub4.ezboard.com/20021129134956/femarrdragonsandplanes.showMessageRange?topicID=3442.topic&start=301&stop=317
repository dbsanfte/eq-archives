<br>
Allow me to say that your attitude(s) are obvious to anyone who reads your posts.<br>
It no longer matters then what you believe. You can go along now and put your head back where it was. Ive no doubt that the area has adjusted to its presence.<br>
<br>
You come across as bigoted, churlish and belligerent. You become vulgar and obtuse when confronted. I suspect you dont even know what I am talking about.<br>
<br>
I offer all your posts as proof. If it were just 'ME', Carathos. You might have a point. But you have many more detractors than that. And no crusade to fall back on. You are merely a tiresome voice droning in the background. You dont even know it. You listen to your own propaganda. The ultimate inbreeding.<br>

It is rare that I show those qualities to someone who has not earned my disdain, such as you.  Bigoted??  Now you're just talking out of your ass.  Show me just one example of my bigotry, Chit.  You've always stated how evidence is important to you, now provide some or shut the @#%$ up.  Vulgar?  See the last sentence; again, to those that deserve it.  Obtuse?  Hardly.<br>
<br>
All of my posts are no good as proof of my being bigoted or obtuse.  I'm afraid you'll have to produce specific examples if you want your claim to have merit.  I'd really also like to see these <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> many</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> other detractors I have.  I can think of four, I don't qualify that as many.  And I don't need any three-year-old, over and done with crusade to keep me going.  Inbreeding?  Now who's being belligerent, churlish and obtuse?<br>
<br>
Psst, if anyone is a tiresome voice between me and you, it's you.  Want to put that to a vote?  Be honest, who do you really think would be voted off the island, Chit?  <br>

No I will expend no further effort at convincing you of anything.<br>
I am unconcerned about my popularity. Certainly not on this board.<br>
I was unpopular before your arrival, and so shall I remain. That is the fate<br>
of the crusader. If it comforts your to think that 'if' things were put to a vote,<br>
I would be found to be less popular than you, by all means feel comforted.<br>
I would say that having people of the addmitted quality of the most common posters on the board like me less is a good thing.<br>
I have been trying far longer than you. The fact that you still have contributed in no way to Glori's original point, and have continued to keep flamming me<br>

<br>
I apologize Glori, I let it get carried away.<br>

You make these wild allegations and provide nothing to back up your statements.  And now you say that you won't (can't).  You assume that I care how I am perceived, I do not.  I only care about how I AM.  I care about the truth, which is something that you apparently do not, or you would back up your false statements with actual evidence.  Your tired statements of how I am not important enough to you to provide such evidence are transparent.  All that accomplishes is to further discredit your accusations.  And what kind of crusader cares nothing for the people who have to put up with the crusade?  I'll answer that one for you too:  a poor one.  I'm not really concerned about my popularity either, I just think a vote is a good way to see whose @#%$ people are tired of hearing more.<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> I would say that having people of the addmitted quality of the most common posters on the board like me less is a good thing.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Nice goin, Chit, insult the &quot;crusadees&quot;.<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> I have been trying far longer than you<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->You're older, duh.<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> The fact that you still have contributed in no way to Glori's original point, and have continued to keep flamming me<br>

<br>
But for those with the ability to think:<br>
<br>
I was just thinking, if I am the person Carathos tries so hard to convince god knows who, of god knows what. If I were that person. Why would he bother?<br>
It would seem to me I would have no audience. Why would anyone listen to such a person? What exactly is he afraid of? Yes I know he will of course hop in with another post telling us all he isnt afraid of anything...yeah yeah yeah<br>
His actions show everyone with any insight that he IS afraid of something. Just a question of what. There must be some human dynamic at work here. Something fundamental.<br>

They then dropped a banana on a rope and waited for a monkey to try to grab it.  When the monkey went to reach for it, they sprayed all the monkeys with water.  The next day, they drop a banana on a rope and wait for another monkey to reach for it.  When he does, they spray all the monkeys with water.  The next day, they remove one of the monkeys, then drop a banana on a rope, when the new monkey reaches for the banana, the other 4 attack him, keeping him from the banana.  The following days they remove one monkey and replace him with a monkey that had not previously been exposed to the experiment.  Finally, they come to a day where none of the monkeys present have been sprayed with water, they replace one of the monkeys and lower the banana on a rope.  The new monkey reaches for the treat, the other 4 monkeys attack him.<br>
<br>
Why did the 4 monkeys that had not been sprayed with water attack the new monkey when he reached for the banana?<br>
<br>
They don't know, thats just the way its always been done......<br>
<br>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
That may not be the way the story originally went, but I think that most people will get the gist of it.  What does it have to do with anything?<br>
<br>
In my non-religious opinion, I don't mind the fact that God is sparsely included in our government's proceedings.  If for no other reason than to remind the fools that are in power that at some point, some day, they MAY have to answer for what they are doing today.  If there was no reminder whatsoever that there may one day be some retribution for actions taken today, then what is to keep our lawmakers from passing any law they wish to benefit themselves?<br>
<br>
But by the same token, if one side of an argument has only to say, "but its always been done that way", then we should consider ourselves no better than a group of monkeys in a cage.  God gave us free will, whether it be my God, your God, our God, or their Gods, we all have free will, and in America we have the right to excercise that free will.  <br>
<br>
If anyone can come up with a decent reason to take it off, then so be it.  But feeling uncomfortable saying or reading it is not valid.  If this were the case, then it is uncomfortable for me to see the Koran, the Satanist Bible, the Holy Bible, and many other religious books on display at my local bookstore.  These books should not be printed anymore, none of them.  What is good for one is good for all.  But why stop there?  I would like to remove all references to any slavery in America's past, it makes me feel uncomfortable to know that my ancestors could have participated in that.  Also, I would like to remove any instances to any cruelties to American Indians.  My heritage has been spoiled because of what the white man did to my race, and it pains me to see evidence of it.  I would like to also no longer see any relation to the fact that the sun is the center of the galaxy.  I believe as the only planet which bears life in the immediate vicinity, we should be considered the center of our existance regardless of what "science" says.  This could go on and on, all the way back to the dark ages if we wanted, but then those times make me feel uncomfortable as well, so we should continue further back.  As a matter of fact, I would like to see no more printing of any books with any type of reference to God, or any other spiritual being, religion, slavery, cruelty, future events, past events, blood, hate, love, anger, sex, violence, and happiness.<br>
<br>
I think I just proposed a completely paperlass society!<br>

In response to your post 1270 in this thread.<br>
<br>
1.  I suggest we don't know you are anything more than a random complaint generator.  If you don't believe me, start a bonfire in the middle of a sidewalk in front of a cop.  I suggest that's the only way you'll ever know.  I suggest you also test the theory of gravity by jumping off a 20-story building.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 0] --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/alien.gif ALT="0]"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
2.  Sorry, didn't recognize your bizarro characterization of that incident.  So, confronting someone who was cussing in a most reprehensible and obscene manner in front of children and threatening folks just doing their jobs is a bad thing (you're the only person to think there is anything humiliating therein, just educational to the poor deluded piece of shyt)?  Wow, you really are wacky and chock full o' double standards.<br>
<br>
3.  Not odd at all that I don't have a catalogued memory of every short story, novel or carving in a bathroom stall I've ever had the misfortune to run across.  No one does, not even you (despite your many claims thereto).  As I used to read 3-4 novels a week during high school and college, that's quite a list to recall.  I don't recall Coventry, although I'm sure I read it.  I know I read &quot;The Moon...&quot; although I don't recall whatever Heinlein's &quot;moral&quot; may have been.  I disagree with your reverence for the man.  His philosophy was quite self-referenced and self-centered, and remarkably unrealistic.  He was an entertaining writer, especially while I was an adolescent boy, but that's about it.<br>
<br>
Please enlighten me on what I've apparently missed from either fiction by the man.  The only overarching theme through his books that I've ever agreed upon is the patent superiority of redheads.<br>
<br>
4.  I didn't ignore anything.  The requirement to attend school of some sort (home school, private school, etc. are fine options to public school in most communities), does not vitiate any of my statements.  Everyone WILL hear stuff they don't want to.  Whether that's walking through the mall (a bunch of teenagers were cussing and talking about oral sex in front of my 4 year olds the other day), flipping on the TV (I feel violated everytime I see a George Foreman Grill ad), or the radio (I caught a bit of a Mariah Carey song the other day, I felt so ashamed).<br>
<br>
5.  I fear for the future if what you say is true.  You've propagated?  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :eek --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/eek.gif ALT=":eek"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I guess Darwin was wrong. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uraedwulf.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Raedwulf</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_thatch.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 1217<br> <font color=#E9D756>(7/15/02 10:42:17 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3442.topic&index=313>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Carathos</span><hr size=1> Chit:  Of course you can't convince Carathos or I or anyone else on this board of anything, because you make no effort to do so.

Where is someone presenting their view at the expense of someone elses?  The atheist dad is perfectly capable of telling his daughter that he disagrees with the State.  Noones view is being eliminated.  The dad is trying to eliminate the view of a lot of other folks, simply because it disagrees with his.  The only one guilty of an effort to silence, is the dad.<br>
<br>
[P.S.  I love the fact that the daughter and her mother (the two were not married at any time, and the dad does not have custody) are churchgoers and oppose the dad's efforts.  I guess his next lawsuit is gonna be to stop the local church from mentioning God, too.]<br>

you keep bringig this up. It is a ridiculous characterization of the issue. Lincoln promoted his views on slavery at the expense of southern farmers. I promote my views that robbery is wrong by calling the police to stop a robbery. You are mischaracterizing the issue. This man did not go into a school and shoot the teacher leading the Pledge. He went through the proper channels and endeavored to get a change he wanted. In this case, to date, the system has supported his attempt at change. <br>
Your way of putting it would be like you accusing me of promoting my view at your expense by voting in the election. Of course I am promoting my view. Of course it is at the expense of those who disagree. So what?<br>

<br>
While this line of thought has been oft repeated here, in my reading of this thread, this is not the issue at hand. There is a difference between being exposed to something in a bookstore and being exposed to it in a state sanctioned and dictated manner. I believe the question at hand is not whether I have the right to impose my will, preference or sensibilities on you (collectively). It is whether it is legal (constitutional) for said exposure to be state mandated, sanctioned or ratified, and what the effects, consequences and/or damage of such sanctioned exposure might be. The rest is a lot of emotional reaction, knee jerk rhetoric and off topic issues. All of which is fine I guess in this type of forum but shouldnt be seen as addressing the topic as I see it originally constructed <p>I think, therefore I am . . .
