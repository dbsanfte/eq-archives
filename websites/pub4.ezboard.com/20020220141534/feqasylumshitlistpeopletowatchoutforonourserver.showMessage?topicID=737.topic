His attitude is much worse than I can  convey. The screen shots in the three above links show him coming back for his promised kill steal camp hogging.<br><br>Our little group was fighting in High Keep at the guard room. Domestic was in the room next to us (the Lookout room) and was killing everything in there as well as periodically sneaking some pulls out of our room. We asked him to stop and he just ignored us. <br><br>After a while he started pulling out into our room again so our puller started taking the pulls in the lookout room as well. Well, he comes out and tells us &quot;if you take any other pulls out of the Lookout room I will make sure you don't get anything.&quot;<br><br>Well this doesn't bode well. Two of the larger of us (troll and a vah shir) block the door so he stays in there with his own pulls while fighting immediately in front. I know that this part was wrong. He starts bitching and tells us that he will come back with his necro and take everything. <br><br>Before that threat, when we blocked the door, I talked with the guildleader of Domestic's guild (Soulcollector and Domestic are in different guilds but definately the same person), who said basically, &quot;what did he do this time?&quot; I didn't get screenshots of that.<br><br>Later, Soulcollector logs on. I didn't get all of his harassment. He made a pet and took the whole bottom floor where we were. I then did a /guildstatus of him and saw he was in a different guild with that character and kept a conversation up with the leader's wife since their leader wasn't on. The whole time he killed absolutely everything on the bottom floor. That is basically where the pictures start. He was quite right. When he said he would take the whole floor and not leave us anything, he was right.<br><br>The entire group /petitioned him. Several others /reported him when he began getting abusive. There were no GM's on so we had to rely on his guilds to do something about it. He was very abusive but near the end started being extra friendly. I assume that was when his latter guild started talking to him and several of the group told him that he had been  /petitioned and /reported. I took screen shots willy nilly and know I didn't get the most abusive of his comments as it was really quick and on the fly. I just wanted proof with it also. <br><br>Hopefully his guilds will take care of it and do the right thing. I know the guild Domestic is in and trust they will do the right thing but have had no experience with Soulcollector's guild. I hope that they do the right thing too. Abusive people should have to suffer the consequences of their actions.<br><br>Thanks for listening,<br>Poopuu Buhtworms <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/utyralthekithless.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tyral the Kithless</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Board Whore</span><br> <font color=#000033>(1/7/02 11:12:52 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=737.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://secondrising.8m.com/images/smilies/iamwithstupid.gif height=46 width=41></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Soulcollector aka Domestic</span><hr size=1> A number of things:<br><br>1. The Lookout Room is considered a separate camp. It sounds as if you guys had an issue with the fact that he chose to take it, thus depriving you of two more mobs.<br><br>2. You guys blocked him into the room. How cute. You realize if he tried to escape to the guards because the mob was kicking his ass that you would be guilty of causing XP loss? While taking a few mobs from your group (which is common practice down there) might be enough to piss you off, causing someone to lose XP is actually against Verant's rules.<br><br>3. I have serious difficulty taking the word of someone called Poopuu Buhtworms. You're lucky a guide wasn't on. Likely they would have changed your name and put a warning on your account.<br><br>It sounds to me as if your group was seriously out of line. He may have taken a few mobs. Obviously your group was busy with another mob or you would have pulled the mob before he saw it. It doesn't matter anyways, because you didn't engage it, therefore it wasn't a KS.<br><br>Domestic might be a total asshole. He may have said some very snotty things to your group. But you guys had no right to do what you did. I think you should have reconsidered posting this here.

They were fine pulling their room, Domestic was the one who couldn't maintain his satisfaction level.  He was asked not to do it but chose to ignore it, so then when it was done to him, he said he would retaliate...you can't have your cake and eat it too. Sorry.<br><br>As far as what Poopuu's group did, he admitted it wasn't the proper thing to do. However, if Domestic was SOLO in the Lookout room and still pulling from the Guard room I'm quite sure death was not imminent for him. Thus considering he didn't die, yours is once again a moot point. Not the brightest move to make, but it did make a point. <br><br>As far as the naming conventions, that isn't the reason this was posted, and whether or not you take someone seriously based on a name is pretty irrelevant. I would recommend to stay on topic.<br><br>As Poopuu is a fellow guildmate, I have hunted with him on numerous occasions and know that this action was not taken lightly. He is not thin-skinned nor oversensitive, so in my own experience this means that this conduct exhibited by Domestic was WAY outta bounds. <br><br>Makes me wonder why some attack those that post, rather than READING what was posted. This List is for posting problems just like this...and he did break VI's rules with the language issue in the tantrums he threw. Two wrongs may not make a right, however this individual deserves this one IMO. <p>Alganorn Redthorn <BR>Wood Elven Ranger <BR></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ukenlail.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kenlail</A> at: 1/8/02 12:41:43 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/utyralthekithless.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tyral the Kithless</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Board Whore</span><br> <font color=#000033>(1/8/02 3:55:39 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=737.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://secondrising.8m.com/images/smilies/iamwithstupid.gif height=46 width=41></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Soulcollector aka Domestic</span><hr size=1> Don't assume that I didn't read the post entirely.

I've gotten pissed at people when I played too. And hindsight is 20/20. You guys did some things that in retrospect you know weren't ideal.<br><br>The problem is, both sides are having a problem with the other and it escalates. <br><br>It's like a neighbor calling the cops saying hey they torched my car. And then you find out it started with someone getting mad over something, then one egged the house, then the other salted the lawn, then one guy beats up the other guy, then they poison their dog, then they torch the car.<br><br>I mean obviously that's a bit dramatic and all <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  But that's the reason it was moved. Both groups were having a pissing match and both sides escalated it. <br><br>I had someone e-mail me saying they also had a bad experience with Soulcollector. Which leads me to believe this guy is probably a bad egg. Unless they or someone else wants to post about it though, based on just this one thing it's not shitlistable, for the sole reason that both parties in this situation were wrong based solely on your account. (Which personally I think it probably one of the more honest accounts I've seen posted on the shitlist.)<br><br>I would move it if he shitlisted you guys for the same reason. Which he could if the <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> only</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> thing that had happened was you guy blocked him in the room. And if that was the only thing that happened then if he shitlisted you guys it would remain up. But obviously alot more happened.<br><br>Moving it was something I put some thought into, and I don't expect everyone to agree with it. But that was why it was moved. And if other people post bad experiences with this guy, then it will be moved back.<br><br>Otherwise, at this time it's more appropriate for rants. <p><a href="http://www.anarchyboard.com" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.conquest-guild.com/tarot/Tarotsign.jpg" border="0"></a> <br><FONT COLOR=000000 SIZE=1>Realm </FONT><FONT COLOR=FF0000 SIZE=1>RETIRED</FONT><BR><FONT COLOR=000000 SIZE=1>Everquest: Fennin Ro, Karana, Ero Marr & Lanys T'Vyl </FONT><FONT COLOR=FF0000 SIZE=1>RETIRED</FONT><BR><FONT COLOR=000000 SIZE=1>Ultima Online: Catskills </FONT><FONT COLOR=FF0000 SIZE=1>INACTIVE</FONT><BR><FONT COLOR=000000 SIZE=1>Anarchy Online: Beta Tester, Rubi-Ka 1 </FONT><FONT COLOR=FF0000 SIZE=1>RETIRED</FONT><BR><FONT COLOR=000000 SIZE=1>Dark Age of Camelot: Beta Tester;Merlin Midgard</FONT><FONT COLOR=008000 SIZE=1> CURRENT</FONT></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uranjaincognito.showPublicProfile?language=EN>RanjaIncognito</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>n00b!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(1/8/02 7:18:28 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=737.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Soulcollector aka Domestic</span><hr size=1> i like your name very much Poopuu, i think it is a very fitting name for a (ogre?/troll?). <br><br>I also think bullying people  with your higher level characters is silly and a bit immature (but how can i call anyone immature when i giggle uncontrolably at ure funny name lmao lmao)<br><br>regardless of what actually happened... this is a prime example why VI should include the &quot;/eatgnome Target&quot; ability for large races! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br>Gnomes have no place bullying ogres and trolls! hehehe<br><br>P.S. just info for myself: i was pretty sure that more mobs HAD been included to HHK around the time the GB sword quest came about, goblin thieves, goblins and crazed goblins. have the two extra spawns in the LO room been removed? and does this mean that the GB sword quest is gone? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uthedruiddirtt.showPublicProfile?language=EN>TheDruidDirtt</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>n00b!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(1/11/02 12:31:53 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=737.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Soulcollector aka Domestic</span><hr size=1> I guess I will reply on the boards giving my side since everyone is going with poops story.  All I can say really is people need to lighten up, i mean, its a game for christ sakes, play it and have fun, you lose 1 mob who cares, another will pop soon.  All of this tension is going to cause a heart attack ;\.  I didn't steal any mobs from the guard room that night, nor did I train anyone, or KS anyone.  <br><br>My RL friend Soulcollector was spending the night at my house because we had to do some community service for a class at school.  It was a couple nights ago, we decided at school we were going to come to my house after we were done with the community service and work on my monk.  We came to my house and logged on.  We went into HK and started soloing the lookout room, osargen, and the bard, it was good exp for a level 25 monk.  Soon after we get started on that some people keep coming into lookout room looking around for things to pull, I am assuming that is what they are doing because the came in, looked around and left about 10 times.<br><br>I am thinking to myself, this is going to be a long night.  After a bit loggroller comes in, without run on, I say to Soulcollector rofl look at that, no run on.   We have a laugh about that until he pulls a spawn that popped, he ran(walked) out to his group and they proceeded to kill it.  (Soulcollector was playing at this time, i was laying on my bed watching) He says Don't do that again loggroller, and tells the group what he did.  Loggroller sends us a tell saying do what, trying to act like he doesn't know what he was doing.  Soulcollector is the type of person who thinks, an eye for an eye, so he pulls a lookout from there spawn, and kills it.  After that, the crap started.  They started doing some low things, i.e blocking us in the room with 2 people and saying they were not moving for anything, and when soulcollector(playing on domestic) told them to move, he was coutning down from 5, and they were being smartasses and counting down with him.<br><br>He proceeds to countdown from 5 and when he reaches 1, they were still standing there laughing in his face basically.  He tells me thats it, I am sick of this BS and he types /q and logs on his account and gets on his necromancer and heads to highkeep.   He gets there and makes a pet.  starts to kill anything he sees pop.  They start going on about petitioning and such, doesn't bother him at all, then the guy poopuu or something comes around trying to make a deal, saying we will stay out of lookout room if you stop ks'ing and ill tell the gm that is was fixed when he gets here, we agree to that and have made 1 friend out of there group already. (ironic isn't it)<br><br>We log back on domestic and start leveling again, we are taking mad harassment in ooc, we ignore it and keep leveling.<br><br>I don't remember everyones name involved, nor do I care, just realize you were just as wrong as we were for what you did, this shouldn't have been posted here really.  But nonetheless it has been.<br><br>Tonight I petitioned the name poopuu, its a disturbing name, one a 10 year old would use.  They got on me tonight in ooc in HK again when the GM came and made him change it, now he is Daisypicker or something along those lines.  Flons, Bupas and a few others were harassing me tonight, Gallana Lady or something like that, a high level wizard was anon, comes into lookout room and ks's me, a GM see's it, does nothing and just says share spawns and leaves.  Bunch of crap I think, she was over level 49 because she used ice comet on one of the lookouts to finish it, she also said to me while the gm was there, I am here for faction now back off, when I was clearly camping the room.<br><br>So I left the zone, couldn't take anymore harassment in occ, almost everyone in that zone was talking trash in ooc.  Like for no reason, this 20 ranger named Marcilus or something says in ooc, Domestic your nothing without that fungi, I reply want to duel and I will use no tunic, he says I don't want to waste my time.  I reply you mean get wasted, they go on saying now I talk all the trash.  These are things that make the game not fun, at all.
