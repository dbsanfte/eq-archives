We tried to analyze recourse before taking any action, well this time the recourse of our lack of action is very apparent to every American.

<br>
The USA has tried to be peaceable with terrorists for decades now.  Hell, Bin Laden bombed US embassies in Africa not so long ago but we held back.  The USA has been exemplary in its dealings with terrorists.  We have tried to seek peaceful solutions, peace talks that worked for what? A day and a half?  Because the USA is the most powerful nation on the earth, we have taken that as a responsibility and have not acted like bullies.  Yet the “Chihuahuas” continued to “yipe” and bite at our heals.  Terrorist continued to bomb innocents all over the world.  Innocents have died by the hundreds to terrorist activities, laughing at the fact that they keep getting away with it.<br>
<br>
Now, the Chihuahua has bitten the baby and bit hard.  Never in the history of man kind has a terrorist action taken out so many lives, never has it caused more damage and destruction as it has in New York and the attack on the World Trade Center.<br>
<br>
By your reasoning, Bene, the USA should never have entered WW2.  We should have tried to find a “peaceful” solution to Hitler’s reign of terror over millions of innocent Jewish people and the conquest of the rest of the world.  There is only one difference between the Nazis and the terrorists of today.  The Nazis were at least bold enough to stand by their atrocities.   The terrorists have not even come forward yet to claim responsibility.  COWARDS!  <br>
<br>
These people, the terrorist, hate the USA with a white hot passion.  There is nothing the US can do to change that.  We forgive them, they hate us, we strike, they hate us.  They hate everything the USA is.  Our morals, our ideals, our wealth and even our poverty.<br>
<br>
The USA was right to cross the ocean, storm Normandy and crush the Nazis in WW2.  Yes innocent people died.  Yes, many, many good US soldiers died.  Yes, it was sad to have to kill tens of thousands of Germans, both soldiers and civilians.  But in the end, it was what needed to be done to wipe out an incredible evil… the evil of Adolf Hitler and his Third Reich.  (Please note, Germans are not evil, just Nazis who followed Hitler in his horrifying assault on the world)<br>
<br>
The USA has spend billions of dollars in peaceful anti-terrorist actions over the last 20 years.  For over 200 years, the USA has been free from terrorism on our soil.  Our government has been stellar in keeping this nation safe from senseless, ruthless attacks against innocent civilians when other governments, just as noble, have not been able to.  But eventually those terrorist would break through and strike at the heart of the USA.   And all the money, all the precautions, all the lives devoted to the defense of this great nation could not stop that jet from crashing into the side of one of the greatest structures ever built by mankind, the World Trade Center, killing more people than has ever been killed before in a terrorist attack.  And for what?  To send a message to the USA that we are evil?  To tell us that they hate us, our way of life?  That is exactly the reason.    HEY… Send us a F&amp;%$ing post card with the message then let BOTH sides live in peace.  But that is not their way.  Terrorism has grown more and more bold, ruthless and aggressive in the last decade.  <br>
They want a war.  <br>
They declared war.  <br>
They struck out with an act of war.<br>
<br>
Now it is time for the “big dawg” to bite back<br>

.. by firing cruise missles at the base in Aghanistan which it was supposed he was living in (he wasn't there at the time), and the medical supplies factory which it was believed he produced chemical/biological weapons in (later admitted that that was wrong).<br>
<br>
Osama bin Laden is about as representative of Moslem or arabic people as David Koresh was of Christians, or Timothy McVeigh of Americans. He received backing and training from America. The terrorist pilots who crashed the planes were trained in the US.<br>
<br>
If (as the evidence is currently shaping up) it turns out that bin Laden was behind this, by all means go after him and this time, don't miss. Hell, go after him anyway, he probably deserves it anyway. But eliminating one man won't solve the social unrest which is the root of the problem, and targetting Islamic or arabic people/nations in general will only exacerbate it.<br>
<br>
News I've been seeing recently suggests that the Taliban may have bin Laden under house arrest, and be willing to hand him over to US autorities. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uceldor.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Celdor</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ultrafx.com/note.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 1170<br> <font color=#E9D756>(9/12/01 7:28 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=49.topic&index=45>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I want payback</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> You know you got to stop them at the beginning, like they should have stopped Hitler at Munich, They should've never let him get away with that.

<br>
Take a look at any conflict where one side kept capitulating to the aggressor, you will notice they were simply encouraged to do more of the same. Had the powers of Europe forced Hitler to abide to the agreement that prevented Germany from building a war machine (signed at the end of WWI) then maybe all the bloodshed of WWII would have been lessened. But they kept giving in to this and that until it reached a point where they couldn't avoid acting, and by then it was almost too late.<br>

MOSCOW, Aug. 30 (UPI) -- Russia's Foreign Ministry on Thursday condemned<br>
 the appointment of Saudi terrorism suspect Osama bin Laden as the<br>
 commander-in-chief of the armed forces of Afghanistan's ruling Taliban<br>
 regime, the official RIA Novosti news agency reported.<br>
<br>
The rest of the story is here :<br>

I'm getting rather sick of people saying that Bin Laden is part of a very small group of people that support terrorism in the mid-east.   Has anyone even bothered to look up where Bin Laden has been rumored to get support?  How many countries have Finanaced him?  If those countries and the people who inhabit them are not responsible, who is? Every country is held accountable by other countries as a group of people.  WE are responsible for what our govornment does.  Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Syria - All citizens there are responsible for what their govornment does.  <br>
<br>
Terrorism has been a way of life over there for DECADES.  It's built into their BELIEF systems, which is largely affected by their RELIGION, and MANY MANY people in the middle east support terrorists and even go so far as to WANT THEIR CHILDREN TO DIE AS TERRRORISTS.  <br>
<br>
Stop being so arrogant as to think that you can re-educate these people or that they have or ever wil have anything resembling your values - they do not want to be re-educated.  <br>
<br>
 Many people simply do not believe the way we do, but we have to defend ourselves.  They want to fight us and they know they cant do that up front face to face, so they hide behind lies and deception and govornments that publicly condemn us as the enemy one day and call us friends the next, and so  many weak-minded people seem to be buying off onto it.<br>
<br>
Making a trade of Bin Laden for 10,000 - 15,000 people that died is not enough.   The right wing arabs would laugh their asses off at us if we just settled with them giving us Bin Laden and a few of his cronies.  He would be replaced inside a year and we would have yet another terrorist. <br>
<br>
 They would laugh even harder if they gave us Laden and we also changed our policy on Israel.  They would have WON, and we would be scampering off with our tails between our legs no matter what spin the media and left wingers put on it.  <br>
<br>
A declaration of war requires the president to pursue the destruction of the enemys ability to conduct war as quickly as possible no matter what the cost.  When the weapon they use is terrorism, what we have to destroy extends quite a ways out..<br>

I normally consider myself an idealist.  In general I'm left leaning on topics such as this, I prefer discussion and diplomacy.<br>
<br>
But, for 20 years we've tried that.<br>
<br>
The entire Middle East region has a long and illustrious history of harboring, supporting and cheering terrorism.  They have been a thorn in much of the world's side.<br>
<br>
On 9/11 they stepped too far.  Until now they've remained small in focus and on a scale we largely had to ignore.<br>
<br>
What we need now is basically the unthinkable.  But, it's honestly the only way.  We need a full scale military assault to break the spine of the governments and schemes that support these organizations.  This may scatter them to the wind, netting us more enemeies, but in the end they'll be far less effective as an emeny.  Following this assault we need economic sanctions and cooperation from the international community to show that these actions are not acceptable.  <br>
<br>
Then we rebuild them as we have any other nation that we've decimated.<br>
<br>
I'd rather fight a dozen enemies wielding guns and bazookas then 1 well funded army that slings airliners at skyscrapers.  The world community can assimilate the dozen smaller enemies.  But it takes a concerted and committed force to tackle the 1.<br>

<br>
Terrorism has been going on for ages, and for the most part has gone by the wayside.  The act on Tuesday, unfortunatly, finally lit that spark that said, &quot;Terrorism needs to stop NOW.&quot;  Whats being done, is that once they find conclusive evidence of who was responsible for this act, they will make a _very_ big example of them, to make people think twice before commiting such an act again.  If you do not set that example, and slap them on the wrist, the terrorism will continue and, quite possibly, be even more severe next time around.<br>
<br>
As far as turning the &quot;celebrators&quot; to ash too.  I say go for it.  They are already brainwashed to think that the United States is the devil, and killing Americans is the &quot;right&quot; thing to do.  If you don't kill em now, you have the chace of another bin Laden in, 1, 5, 10, 20 years from now.<br>
<br>
You hit 'em hard, swift, and precise, and give them a little something to think about.<br>
<br>
If this were to happen to any other country, I would say the same thing.  Killing thousands of innocent lives should not be tolerated by anyone.  They called the war and we're going to end it.<br>
<br>
Just my opinion and how I view it. <p><font face="Arial" size="2">-<a href=http://www.afflictionguild.com/profile.php?username=Jaiieq&charactername=Jaiieq>Jaiieq</a>, <a href=http://www.afflictionguild.com>Affliction</a></font></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ubenedictus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Benedictus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 74<br> <font color=#E9D756>(9/13/01 4:26 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=49.topic&index=51>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> um</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>
By your reasoning, Bene, the USA should never have entered WW2. We should have tried to find a “peaceful” solution to Hitler’s reign of terror over millions of innocent Jewish people and the conquest of the rest of the world. There is only one difference between the Nazis and the terrorists of today. The Nazis were at least bold enough to stand by their atrocities. The terrorists have not even come forward yet to claim responsibility. COWARDS! <br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Um, the USA involvment in WW2 was a Military Strike with the declared motive to end a conflict. It is more comparable with recent US-Military activities in Bosnia, Sumalia, etc.. Actions which I still think are rightly motivated and still support, inspite of some mistakes in the actual execution of them.<br>
<br>
A Military Strike into the Mid, or Near-East the way it is called for by many People on this Board is one motivated out of the need for revenge and retribution, motives that should never be acted upon. Takin the Law into ones own hands is forbidden in all civilized nations for a reason.<br>
<br>
Personally I think we dont live in the World we did 55 years ago, but if you want to draw comparisons: Some out of Hitlers Legitimation for strikin out against Poland and Russia was, that those countries housed a large Jewish population, which in turn was blamed for the cowardly Assassination of Prince Franz Ferdinand and his Wife Spophie Chotek. Though at that Time never proven, german and other european newspapers where &quot;90% sure&quot; that this assassination was staged by Jews. With popular rhetoric, Hitler managed to blame just about everything from the weak Economy (Gas Prices anyone?) to the British &amp; American involvement into WW2 on the &quot;Jewish World Conspiracy&quot;.<br>
<br>
Democracy and Liberalism of the Weimarer Republic where set aside within a few years after that, just because one man was able to channel a peoples shock and hatred to his own ends.<br>
<br>
This is why we need to be ever watchful, outside and inside, never to let our humanistic Ideals slip, no matter how much we want to find a culprit, especially if our ethics are challenged in ways, such as the Attack on the WTC.<br>
<br>
Cause unlike the 1939 Germany, if we, the USA ever forget these Ideals, there is noone there to safe the World.<br>
<br>
<br>
P.S.: I dont think Hitler killed a Jew himself, so dont tell me words and opinions are meaningless, because if Words dont carry weight, Hitler would be an innocent man. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/upoppensteelfist.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Poppen Steelfist</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 87<br> <font color=#E9D756>(9/13/01 4:42 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=49.topic&index=52>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: um</span><hr size=1> Benedictus..I don't mean to be harsh or disrespectful but frankly..you need to STFU.

There will be retribution, there will be justice..and it will cost the lives of many..and all are justified becuase if they had anything at all to do with this attack..then they and country alike should be held accountable and made an international example of.<br>

Men, women, children and elderly supporters of bin Laden or Afganistan should be prepared to die for their cause since they were willing to support an act of war against us..and now its time to pay.  I've heard compassionates talk of &quot;Surgical Strikes&quot;..bullshit..fuck surgical strikes..this needs to be all out war, bombs..ground troops, artillery and mechanized...and don't stop till we find and either capture or fry bin Laden and all his supporters.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh my goodness!...Poppen you're so mean!  you would violate the sovereignty of Afganistan!?  Oh thats horrible!?<br>
<br>
To those who say this...EAD.  They asked for it when they declared war on us through Binladen.  This is not a police action to be &quot;maintained&quot; ..this is a war to be won by any means necessary.<br>

I was Nilanie for those who remember me /em hugs<br>
<br>
I was there. I live in NY.. I saw the planes hit. I watched in horror when the first tower fell and I felt the blast of heat dust and debris from the second tower.<br>
<br>
I know of people who are still missing.  I am sick to my stomach over this because I am watching loved ones worry and wonder in dismay because with every hour that passes it seems less likely there will be survivors.<br>
<br>
I am angry I am scared and I am upset.<br>
<br>
But do not tell me these people can not and should not go unpunished. Do not sit there and tell me violence begets violence and we should seek another form of solution without blasting what ever country/group is behind this and sending the right back into the stone age.<br>
<br>
You tell that to the families that have lost their mother/father/brother/husband/children/fiancee/etc.<br>
<br>
YOU try to imagine what the rest of us are going through.<br>
<br>
My response. Find them find out who is harboring them and do your best to wipe them out.  Treat them as the enemy they are.  We have been attacked at HOME.  NY has ordered over 30,000 body bags. THAT is the reality we are going through.<br>
<br>
I was an idealist.. I woke up to a hellish reality.<br>
<br>
Say a prayer for those in NY..<br>
<br>
Say a prayer we find out who did this<br>
