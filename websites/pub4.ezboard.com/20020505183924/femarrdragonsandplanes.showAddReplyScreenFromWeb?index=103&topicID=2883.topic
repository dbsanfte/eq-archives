Maybe some people kind of expect the people they play with (above a certain level) to know certain basic things about the game, nothing wrong with giving advice and tips to people but I know I am not alone in being sick of having to spoon feed information to people too fucking lazy to go earn that knowledge themselves.<br>

SHE WIL KILL YOUR GROUP.</span><hr size=1> Mitch, the problem is that the learning curve has changed as people say. Back when you and I levelled up to level 40 we had certain areas we had to visit. We had to learn certain skills. <br>
<br>
Tell me when you learnt to FD/split pull and I'll tell you of a dozen monks who still can't. Not because they are crap but because the situation in which it is needed.<br>
<br>
Tanks had to go to Befallen in our day because the BBC was the weapon of choice in the day. You had to do Cazic because BTC's were the fastest weapon around. Mistmoore was a must due to Soulfire Quests and MM Shields. And you and I both know that half the people reading this just went...whats a BTC?<br>
<br>
Now people are forced to level as fast as they can for fear of being told they are inferior a la comments from Vendrix. People don't go hunting for gear anymore liek this. They level as fast as they can knowing that the good gear they hunt now will be useless the next time they log on.<br>
<br>
Yes I agree that some people you group with really don't have a clue but if you stop for 5 minutes you can explain something that they probably haven't had the opportunity to learn themselves.<br>
<br>
It's not inexperienced people that ruin this game for others. It's experienced players destroying the fun of newbies by having a go at them for their lack of skills or gating thus killing them all.<br>
<br>
The truly stupid won't learn but you should spot them half a mile off. <p><CENTER><A HREF="http://ak.lonelygamer.com">

SHE WIL KILL YOUR GROUP.</span><hr size=1> You know, Kerryn, I used to respect the things you had to say, and occasionally, I still do, but for the most part, you have degenerated into a whiny little creep.<br>
<br>
No longer are your posts filled with wit, humorous sarcasm and a laudable sense of humor.  No, now, they seem to be filled with some sort of poisonous venom that's slowly creeped into you over the past few months.<br>
<br>
I don't know what caused the change, can't even begin to speculate, but I do know that your posts are starting to make me cross-eyed.  It's quite obvious that you have a dislike for certain people and certain &quot;types&quot; of gamers.  Your preference has made itself more and more apparent.  <br>
<br>
Had you bothered to read, you'd have noted that Vendrix indeed stated that he had attempted to point out to certain players tips to improve their gameplay only to be told that he didn't know what he was talking about or that they knew what they were doing.  Mitch made the same statement.  How much do you expect people to go out of their way to help when they are only rebuffed?  <br>
<br>
I, personally, prefer strongly to only group with people I know and trust.  Why? For the exact reason that Katty ended up gating.  Yes, I know, she was in a big guild, and that means bad in your book, so she's obviously in the wrong, but once again, if you'd bothered to read, you'd have seen that a) the rogue had to bail, to avoid death.  b) the mage gated also, I imagine to avoid death. c) the sole cause of this was melee that don't know how to handle multiple mobs that are mezzed.  <br>
<br>
The original poster has already posted his error and apology, admitting that this was NOT all Katty's fault.  <br>
<br>
And I'll tell you what, from experience, I HAVE gated on a group that did not assist on mezzed mobs.  I did warn them, twice that I would do so if they did not start assisting and I did so when they did not heed my words.  <br>
<br>
You can only expect the majority of us to go so far in educating the server on how to play this game.  I don't shell out $10 a month so I can be a teacher.  That's not to say I won't assist folks, offer tips or generally help out, but I shouldn't be expected to die repeatedly due to some fool's lack of understanding of the game.<br>
<br>
Back to my original reason for posting, since I've explained myself.  You've set yourself up as this arbitrary little critter who cries foul everytime someone who's gone a bit further or done a bit more speaks up.  You don't listen to reason, and you don't shut up.  You're an anklebiter.  You know, the little damn dogs that yip &amp; yap constantly and try to nip your ankles as you walk by.  They're annoying and so are you.  <br>
<br>
So, let's reiterate.  Katty's skills as an enchanter are not in question, as substantiated by a good portion of this thread.  Her sole POSSIBLE error judgement may have been not offering an IU before leaving the two warriors (because, as we've established, the mage gated and the rogue ran).  Where's your hysterical outrage for them?  Oh, I forgot they're not established to be part of a large guild that drives you mad with jealousy, so they may be forgiven, correct?<br>
<br>
You're a blowhard, just wish I'd recognized it earlier. <p><IMG SRC="http://www.taloncomics.com/Cao.JPG"><BR>

SHE WIL KILL YOUR GROUP.</span><hr size=1> No, the difference is that previous to this our opinions seemed to run concurrent to each other. Now my opinion differs from yours and you don't like it. With all due respect I'm not here to please you and agree with every thing you say.<br>
<br>
Nothing other then that has changed.<br>
<br>
Katty didn't warn the group she was gating. She didn't do the right thing by telling them, offering to UI them before she gated. She got them killed in return for the fact that she feared what they might have done.<br>
<br>
Katty's mezzing skills are not called into question here and if you can't see that you haven't been following the threads as you've so often accused me of. The fact is she deserted them.<br>
<br>
I have nothing against anyone in a powerful guild and who I dislike is based on how I feel that particular person is. For your information on the times that Cattie and I have encountered each other I have found her to be helpful, skilled and polite as I have often found you. But in this case what she did was wrong and I'd be saying the same thing about you had you done the same.<br>
<br>
I am mildly amused by the &quot;we taught you everything you know&quot; point and the fact that that comes from a member of the same guild is quite un-related. <br>
<br>
I have no problem with any type of player, only those players that are assholes which is not solely the domain of the powergamer. <br>
<br>
I don't comment on Vendrix helping others. I just commented that Cattie made the mistake of not doing so but obviously when you were so cross-eyed reading my posts you missed that fact. It's lovely to see that the objectiveness you've shown in the past has begun to waiver for in your mind some people can do no wrong. <p><CENTER><A HREF="http://ak.lonelygamer.com">
