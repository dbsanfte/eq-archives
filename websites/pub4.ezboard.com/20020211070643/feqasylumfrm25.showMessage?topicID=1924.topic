Citric and I both thank you all for coming along.  Vox's are hard logistically as a lot of people have to get to a zone that is not so easy to get to.  Thank you Goolan for delaying your Naggy raid so that we could finish off Vox.<br><br>61 people hung around until the end, with Vox going down in a bit over 2 hours.  Pretty happy with that, although my goal is to have her down and loot handed out within 2 hours.<br><br>loot - bard heaven to be honest :)<br>2 Gauntlets of fiery might<br>2 white scales<br>2 horns<br>Eyepatch<br><br>I think that is all.<br><br>See you all next time.<br><br><br>---<br>1000 Fri 8th FEb US PST went into safe hall and vox was not on track.  Have camped there and will check again before raid and let you all know.  If she is too scared to show her face, Swizeguy will lead the raid the following day at 1800 US PST Sat Feb 9th.<br><br>---<br>As usual we are down on clerics and enchanters.  Please ask your friendly E's and C's to come along and post their names below :)<br><br>---<br>Hi all.  Since Vox has been going down midweek I have decided to change the date and also clear who has registered to join to start afresh.  Please sign up if you are available to come and fit the following criteria.<br><br>The details in this post may change before the raid, please keep a track of the edit number (part of the title of the post) for changes.<br><br>---<br>Citric brave Paladin and myself will be cohosting a Ms Vox raid if she is still breathing. It will be -<br><br>1730 US PST on Fri Feb 8th (1230 9/2/01 Sydney time) meeting in the King room in Permafrost. Be on a little early if you will need ports, and send a tell to Lunitune or Citric if you will need one.<br><br>Our plan is to get her killed within 2 hours, but that is tough on an open vox raid like this.<br><br>---<br>More loot details are given below, but loot is basically NBG with no defaults. All paladins will be assigned a number before the fight so that if their no drop book is dropped we can quickly roll and loot (incl rez if the pally has gone down).<br><br>Cash and cash items we would like handed to us to cover the costs of components (a raid like this costs more than 1k to put together).<br><br>---<br>Maps and Info<br>http://www.eqatlas.com/permafrost.html<br>http://www.eqatlas.com/permafrostmap.html<br>http://everquest.allakhazam.com/zones/Antonica/Perma.htm<br><br>A link to a map with the route we will take will be posted here. Please have a copy with you during the raid. <br>http://www25.brinkster.com/victusfortis/Maps/permafrost.gif<br><br>Good Vox raid info at -<br>http://members.home.net/dsmithwr/vox_raid<br>http://www.crimsontalon.com/raidvox.htm<br><br>---<br>Who do we love on a VOx raid?<br>CLERICS, CHANTERS, CLERICS, CHANTERS AND MORE CLERICS AND CHANTERS. We can't get enough of them.<br>If Vox fails it is most likely because we have not been able to mana drain her. <br><br>If you are keen to come on this raid, take it as a given that you should ask your friendly chanters/clerics to sign up and join you (us). Please do this so that we can get the raid over and the loot divvied up as quickly as possible. If there is a delay (and it is not because someone did something silly) it will be because we are sourcing more lovely clerics and enchanters.<br><br>We would like 5 min chanters and 6 min clerics for a 36 + raid group (depending on classes and levels).<br><br>Peridots will be provided.<br><br>---<br>begging, pleading, enticing.. no just buying chanters<br>I have the dropped chanter spell "Theft of Thought" (Lev 51 I believe) which will be randomed off after she falls (if she falls :)       .<br><br>---<br>Classes Needed (ideally) - at least<br>War 52 at least one<br>Clerics x 6 (1 x 52 and 5+ of 40+) pref an epic cleric also (will be allowed to roll on relevant items).<br>Chanters x 5 (45+)<br>Rogues x2 (45+)<br>Mages/Wizzies as many as possible (45+)<br>Druids x 2 (42+)<br>Shaman x 2 (42+)<br>Monks x 2 (45+)<br>Wars several (45+)<br>Bards for resists/mana (45+)<br>Necro x 1 (45+)<br><br><br>---<br>Strategy<br>There is not a great deal of strategy needed on Vox raids, but some is good.<br><br>Fairly early into fight Vox should be dispelled. As a cleric she will have some hefty buffs on. It is believed that as an old world monster she can have a max of 32000 HP when buffed, so reducing buffs should reduce a lot of her HP cheaply.<br><br>When dispelled twice by each enchanter please indicate in shout. Chanters should then start mana seiving/stealing.<br><br>Debuffs can then happen including<br>Chanter - MR debuff<br>Mage/Shammy - Malosi line (poison/dis by shammy if needed)<br>Rogue poison debuffs if they stack.<br><br>Then haste debuff/debilitate (shammy)<br><br>Please wait for the signal before sending in pets.<br><br><br>---<br>Notes<br>Good CR and Mr (+70 is ideal) (more important than AC). Also, the mobs in Permafrost have a high CR, so use other types of spells on her.<br><br>She fears, so please have run OFF. If you don't then you may end up in one of the bear pits. If you do end up in such a pit, take the death (or FD if you can) and we'll get you out after the rezzes.<br><br>Can anyone give a definitive statement on how fear works with VOx/naggy? I have been feared a couple of times but just stay motionless, yet others seem to run off (maybe they were just scared). <br><br>You HAVE to be in Vox's melee range to cast on her.<br><br>To get to the safe hall we have to WALK past Vox herself. Someone will be sent in first to get her agro. They will sit in the safe hall out of harm's way so that the rest of us can pass by without getting her attention and get ready to take her on.<br><br>The closest portal is the druid one in Surefall Glade. Wizards can port to West Karana. You can also use the portal pots in Timorous Deep to port right into Halas (invis first if you are a naughty race). For more instructions visit <br><br>http://www.eqatlas.com/kunark/timorousteleport.html<br><br>Casters if you don't mind binding in Permafrost for the raid, please bind in the safe hall (you will be told when to do it) so that if you die you can mem the required spell and get straight back into combat. (Last raid dear Uladar brave druid had 5 corpses lined up for rez after Vox went down, but hopefully this will not happen to you :)       .<br><br>We will try to fight Vox near the safe hall so that healers can heal from around the corner where they will avoid most of the AoE spells that Vox casts. She will however end up moving around as agro changes so please stay near the safe hall to keep her there (and allow the healers to heal from safety).<br><br><br><br>---<br>Buffs<br>There should be 4 fake buffs (for when she dispells) first on your list. So at fake buff time get rid of all other buffs. You should have a person in your group that can fake buff, so look in group for them. If you need more buffs from outside, there will be someone set aside to do them (prolly shammy/druid/cleric).<br><br>See if you can get hold of some greater resist cold and magic potions from your local friendly shammy, they add +25 to each of those resists.<br><br>Buffing will be done in the corridors outside the lair before we move to the safe hall (in case she gets agrod on the way through).<br><br>We will not break into groups of same classes to buff like I tried to on the Naggy raid.<br><br>There will be a person for each of the following, please be ready to write their name down when it is shouted -<br>GMR (group magic resistance)<br>Clarity<br>Haste<br>Shammy melee buffs<br>Shammy HP buffs<br>Symbols and cleric buffs will be done in group (peridots provided).<br>A druid on circle of summer (if no CoS druid available then cleric will FR).<br><br>---<br>Groups<br>There is a raid leader (Citric) and secondary leader (Lunitune). This is so that we can keep things moving as fast as possible. At this stage the plan is to have Luni registering people and forming the final groups whilst Citric is inside setting up initial groups and clearing the IG's. This means that we should be able to get a lot of the IG's out of the way whilst we chase up the last of the clerics and chanters (and whatever other classes we may need).<br><br>If you are designated as a group leader (usually by something like XXXX please invite A, B, C etc) then please disband from your current group and start sending tells/inviting. You may find it much easier to type <br>/target charname (for example /target lunitune)<br>instead of looking for them coz there will be a lot of peeps there.<br><br>Even if you are not group leader, please write down your group members' names in case your leader goes LD.<br><br>I think we will try to group all pallies together (with healer) so they can LoH each other and organise it between themselves.<br><br>---<br>Loot<br>Group leader of the xp group please loot. Please pass on all items to Citric or Lunitune to cover some of the component costs. Please respect this as organising raids on a continuing basis gets very expensive. 40 people = around 40 peridots for Naltron (if don't have a group naltron cleric available) and 40 peridots for rune (ideally) = over 800 plat.<br><br>IF a no drop item drops shout out what it is and if you feel comfortable doing the rolls on it then do so, otherwise send a tell to Citric, Lunitune (or other designated roller) for them to do it. <br><br>Nice items WILL drop from this ugly dragon, some VERY nice items. HOWEVER, the fact is most people will not win this time around (which is why it is important for everyone to turn up even when they have won what they need). Please don't be upset if you don't win the roll this time around. And please don't spam the shout/ooc channels with negative comments and gripes. If you have a problem send a tell to Citric and Lunitune. Problems by tells WILL be fixed/dealt with. Problems by shouts/oocs just result in hard feelings all around, and a potentially unsatisfying experience).<br><br>Please do not loot Vox when she drops. The raid leaders will say who is to loot her.<br><br>Pallies will be assigned a number for the book roll before the main assault on Vox. If the book drops the roll will happen right away so that the winning pally can loot it quick.<br><br>THe rest of the items will be looted and rolled on after ALL peeps have been rezzed 2 items (or maybe 3) at a time by Lunitune and Citric simultaneously. Interested parties will be asked to register as soon as possible after vox's death so as to speed up the process, however the items will not be rolled on until all parties are rezzed. For example -<br><br>Tobryn's mystical eyepatch and runed bolster belt are but 2 of the drops. Luni takes up the eyepatch roll and Citric the belt. ASAP each of us will list what the item is, the stats, who can roll and shout. Send tells to that person ONCE only. At some stage you will be assigned a number, but that may be later. This may happen with a couple of other items at the same time if possible. Make sure you say which item you want, and send the tell to the right person. When ALL peeps are rezzed the call will be made again. Only send a tell for the item then if you did not before. Numbers will be assigned and you will be asked to send a tell if your name is missed. This is when your second tell happens. Believe me, the loot peeps are in tell hell at this time, and if you confuse the process by sending multiple tells the whole thing slows down.<br><br>Ideally if a person who is controlling the loot wants to roll on the item, they should not do the roll, but this may not be possible.<br><br>A second roll will not be given to people who are level 52 as with Luclin there is now an opportunity to play without forgoing xp (using alt adv system).<br><br>If you are rolling please keep anon off so everyone can see your class.<br><br>Some of the loot (taken from http://members.home.net/dsmithwr/vox_raid)<br>1.

I have considered your request for the 42 bard to join.  We already have a lot of bards and the lev min for such classes is 45 (esp as we have so many).  If they wish to turn up that is ok and I'll squeeze them into your group (plz remind me on the day), however I will not let them roll on anything for the above reasons <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br><br>The only classes we are prepared to drop the level for at this stage are healing classes because they are always in demand.  The bard will alleviate the healing requirements with great resists, but will not be able to withstand the fear and DD's cast as level is the most important aspect here - and therefore not get many resists off.
