<br>
But in the excerpt it stated very clearly that the audience wasn't captive, it stated that many of the senators got up and walked out.  The priest chose to pray in public, the senators that didn't want to hear it chose to leave.  No one locked them in the room and chained them to their seats to force them to listen.<br>
<br>
As for the scripture that you quoted, Jesus does not say that praying in public is wrong, he simply says that <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> the reasons</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> for which some people pray in public are not the reasons for which you <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> should</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> be praying.  You should be praying for forgiveness and a bond with God, not for the admiration/acceptance of men.  As with all his teachings, Jesus provided the people with a way to be secure in knowing you are praying for the right reasons when he suggested that <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> &quot;when you pray, go into your room, close the door and pray to your Father, who is unseen. Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you.&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->  He was not saying that praying in public is wrong, he was simply saying that you would be secure in knowing (as God knows) that when you pray in private, you are doing it for the right reasons.  This was more a lesson to teach praying for the correct reason than a lesson denouncing prayer in public. <p>________________________________________________________<BR><a href><font color=#CC90FF><i><b>"I am a Child of the Universe.

<br>
I agree. However, Jesus directed that when you pray "go into your room". Not my room, not our room, not outdoors in the town square... no, in <b><i>your</i></b> room. He is obviously saying that it is better to pray in private than to pray in public. Why? <i>Because</i> public prayers tend to become nothing more than puppeteering to the audience. Remember, Jesus said "And when you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners <b><i>to be seen by men</b></i>" Jesus is telling his followers not to pray in public for purposes other than conducting the business of their ministry. So, yes, Jesus speaks out against public prayers under certain conditions and tells his followers it is better to pray in private. It doesn't get much clearer than that.<br>
<br>
<i>"But in the excerpt it stated very clearly that the audience wasn't captive, it stated that many of the senators got up and walked out."</i> <br>
<br>
A "captive audience" is not one locked in a room, or chained to walls. A "captive audience" is one that assembles for some sort of business only to have it disrupted due to no choice of their own. Usually, the disruption is provided by a speaker who makes a presentation that was neither requested or planned.<br>
<br>
Besides, why the he<i></i>ll should I be put into a postion to have to leave a public gathering because some joker is abusing his power and authority? I take it, then, you would be all for a school principle chanting a Buddhist mantra over the PA system? Or, presenting a Baptist prayer over a PA system? The students could all get up and walk out, right?<br>
<br>
Or do you understand what it means for people of authority (especially public officials) to use their position of power and push their religious point of view onto those underneath them? That sort of coercion is flagrantly wrong. Yes, it is coercion. It is applying pressure upon those under you to bow their heads in prayer when in fact they don't want to.<br>
<br>
There are certain things we all can't do in public. Public officials should have enough guts (temperance) as to not wear their faith on their lapel. Idiotic prayers in the Senate will not make this country great. What will make it great is when the praying idiots in the senate stop lying to the public and actually do their damn jobs. <p><center><font face="arial" color="CCFFFF">Lurikeen Mali'Kyre</FONT></center><center><table style='Filter: Shadow(Color=#150517, Direction=225)'><tr><td><span class='Necromancer'><font size=2 color="red" face="arial"><i>NECROMANCER</span></td></tr></table></font></i></center><center><font face=arial></center><center><I>"My eyes will pierce your soul, then I will take your life!"</I></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/urheaton.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Rheaton</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 203<br> <font color=#E9D756>(6/2/02 4:14:34 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=302.topic&index=60>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Waaaaaazup!</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  Or do you understand what it means for people of authority (especially public officials) to use their position of power and push their religious point of view onto those underneath them?

Is there such a thing as 'pushing religious' beliefs upon someone? I mean, is it really that great of an offense...or a offense at all? Most likely depends on the individual.<br>
<br>
I've heard that term many times in my life, and in some cases I would have to agree that some are zealots. But more then likely, if a Buddhist got up and started chanting his 'shaazams' over the PA or anywhere else, I would fall over laughing.<br>
<br>
Is the power and conviction of prayer so strong that it 'pressures' someone into guilt of obligation to bow their heads? Some forms of Christian religion promote raising ones hands and face, eyes wide open while speaking loudly and clearly to God. However, most of the time those prayers end with a Holy Ghost train formed and circling the room...talking about a 'captive audience'.<br>
<br>
Lurikeen, what kind of church did you attend when you were a wee lad and what was the turning point in your beliefs? I cant help but to think that at some point you were 'forced' to attend church.. Forgive me if ima wrong.<br>

<br>
I would say no such natural right exists.  If you were born into slavery, you can not suddenly claim you have a right to freedom and be set free.  The most we can have is the desire to be free and the will to try to make it happen.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> How does a 'natural state of liberty' apply to creatures other then humans in your mind?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
I would say natural liberty is the freedom to try to survive and prosper.  This can work out in many ways like predator/prey or cooperation that benefits the involved parties.  So for cows, there is a little of both.  We are their predators.  However, they are a very successful specias because we value them and do not try to eat them into extinction.<br>
<br>

<br>
I would agree it depends on the individual.  It also depends on the timing.  Nothing like coming out of the shower to have someone ask about my relationship wuth Jesus.  If it is a time when I have nothing planned, I enjoy talking about religion.  However, a lot of the time I am caught in the middle of something.  At that point it is more like dealing with a telemarketer.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Is the power and conviction of prayer so strong that it 'pressures' someone into guilt of obligation to bow their heads?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I would say it is more the power of peer pressure.  We are ingrained to be very social creatures.  So when everyone is doing the same thing, it is a rebellious act (whether justified or not) to do differently.<br>

&quot;how would you feel if the President of the US televised that there was no god?&quot;<br>
<br>
Man, it wouldn’t surprise me one bit to tell the truth. Bush is showing himself to be a pushover...and wishy-washy. But to actually hear it said by the Prez. would offend me. <br>
<br>
To argue theology is one thing, but to argue existence vs. non-existence is another. Most middle-of-the-road &quot;Supreme Being&quot; believers extend a hard-core believer the benefit of the doubt...the atheist does not. For the hard-core believer to hear an atheist argue that there is no God is like telling a 5-year-old there is no Santa. Although the believer will contend that the atheist lacks in spiritual enlightenment and faith, they cannot refute the carnal knowledge. Believers tend to take more offense when told they believe in the Tooth Fairy, IMO.<br>
<br>
Quath: &quot;I would say natural liberty is the freedom to try to survive and prosper. This can work out in many ways like predator/prey or cooperation that benefits the involved parties. So for cows, there is a little of both. We are their predators. However, they are a very successful specias because we value them and do not try to eat them into extinction.&quot;<br>
<br>
Lurikeen: &quot;In my view we are all animals preying upon each other. This all goes to the root of our basic biological functions and natural selection. We humans just happen to be the most successfull species for the time being. Putting the issue crudely into perspective... we are top dog and can eat whatsoever we choose. I have found that we usually feel discomfort eating species we use for pets, or we believe have a certain degree of intelligence. However, again, this is all part of our basic animalistic nature. That nature, viewed in and of itself, is amoral. It is that very nature that has guaranteed our success as a species.&quot;<br>
<br>
I hear a bit of 'survival of the fittest&quot; in both your statements and I agree to a certain extent. However, I ask that we apply &quot;S.o.t.f.&quot; to child sweatshops in China and to slavery in America's early history. If God did not give all men and women freedom, then freedom is only something created by man for man. To say 'inherently born' with certain human rights would be just opinion and not a fact. In other words, we are only free cause we are the stronger species and we wish to call ourselves free and we wish that every man be free.<br>
<br>
Imo, and in the opinion of several of the founders, God intended for us to be free and all inherent human rights come from the grace of God. Without this grace.. we could overtake one another, putting the weaker in captivity and bondage (like early American's did with slaves). If men dictate what freedom is, then freedom can be taken away. That deep inter feeling that we are suppose to be and meant to be free means nothing when it is merely our desire to be free and that we maintain our freedom with dominating force (Survival of the fittest).<br>

<br>
Rheaton, you write as though there is only one type of religious person (the Christian) and one type of non-religious person (the Atheist). Your generalizations don't make much sense to me, since the religious landscape is not as cut and dry as you portend it to be. Furthermore, the point was that you would be <b><i>offended</i></b>. Why is it that you think all of us non-Christians want to hear your christian prayers and dogmas? What, you can be offended, but we can't?<br>
<br>
<i>"If God did not give all men and women freedom, then freedom is only something created by man for man. To say 'inherently born' with certain human rights would be just opinion and not a fact."</i><br>
<br>
Much like the existence of god being your opinion? Again, we evolved in a state of natural liberty. What does that mean? It means when you were born you had no beliefs. You had no government or religion. You were naked. I think that is pretty much factual.<br>
<br>
<i>"In other words, we are only free cause we are the stronger species and we wish to call ourselves free and we wish that every man be free."</i><br>
<br>
See the above statement.<br>
<br>
<i>"Imo, and in the opinion of several of the founders, God intended for us to be free and all inherent human rights come from the grace of God. Without this grace.. we could overtake one another, putting the weaker in captivity and bondage (like early American's did with slaves).

<br>
Again, you are missing the underlying premise that of "natural liberty": the state of nature. "Human rights" are the advantages provided to us a species. Notice, we as a species measure equality and subordination based upon <i>intellect</i> and type of species. Rights are not given by a god as much as people who want to justify their view of life invoke a god for the purpose of bringing legitamacy to their view. However, such an invocation is misplaced at best and dishonest at worst. BTW, I recall that the founding fathers (especially Paine, Franklin, Jefferson, Madison) held a strong Lockean view of politics. That is, they would argue much as I am now sans evolutionary theory, since it was yet to be discovered.<br>
<br>
We are free because of the state of nature. It is the laws we create that bind us; hence, government is a necessary evil. <p><center><font face="arial" color="CCFFFF">Lurikeen Mali'Kyre</FONT></center><center><table style='Filter: Shadow(Color=#150517, Direction=225)'><tr><td><span class='Necromancer'><font size=2 color="red" face="arial"><i>NECROMANCER</span></td></tr></table></font></i></center><center><font face=arial></center><center><I>"My eyes will pierce your soul, then I will take your life!"</I></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/urheaton.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Rheaton</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 212<br> <font color=#E9D756>(6/4/02 8:36:01 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=302.topic&index=67>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Waaaaaazup!</span><hr size=1> <br>

Lurikeen, your right and I humbly apologize. Do to my religious convictions, I did in fact classify an Atheist as one of no beliefs. The fact is that you do have a belief system or religion of sorts. /humble. However, I did try and stay on track with the senator's Christian-like prayer when referring to 'believers'. I do acknowledge that there are many assorted 'styles' of religion.<br>
<br>
I would be offended if the President did address the nation and say &quot;there is no God&quot;. I would consider it more his opinion then an abuse of power. However, I would consider it an attack on religious beliefs.... How do we find fairness while maintaining freedom of religion and speech?<br>

Yes, that is a question the Republic has struggled with since our founding. :) That is why "God fearing" people who founded this nation put into place a seperation of Church and State. Introduction of public prayers in school and government, bible reading, and even going so far as to put "In God We Trust" on our currency in the 1950s has gone far to errode and undermine the liberties we all hold dear in this country. I mean no offense here, but petty little Christians, thinking only of themselves and not others, have politiced their way into US laws all for power. Such Christians are a threat to us all. <p><center><font face="arial" color="CCFFFF">Lurikeen Mali'Kyre</FONT></center><center><table style='Filter: Shadow(Color=#150517, Direction=225)'><tr><td><span class='Necromancer'><font size=2 color="red" face="arial"><i>NECROMANCER</span></td></tr></table></font></i></center><center><font face=arial></center><center><I>"My eyes will pierce your soul, then I will take your life!"</I></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uquath.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Quath</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 47<br> <font color=#E9D756>(6/4/02 9:39:24 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=302.topic&index=69>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Waaaaaazup!</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Imo, and in the opinion of several of the founders, God intended for us to be free and all inherent human rights come from the grace of God.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

I believe the Bible refers many times to slavery but never condemns it.  I think if God really did want freedom to rank up high, he would have put it in the 10 Commandments.  Lying and envy made it to the commandments but not slavery.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> How do we find fairness while maintaining freedom of religion and speech?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
This is pretty tough.  I think politically it has always been safe to appear Christian or devout.  In that way you fit within the majority and are more easily accepted.  Many of the founding fathers were Deists, Unitarians, freethinkers or sporatically Christian.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> I did in fact classify an Atheist as one of no beliefs. The fact is that you do have a belief system or religion of sorts.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
An atheist has no belief in gods, but I don't think you can call &quot;nonbelief&quot; a belief system and definitely not a religion.  I think Lurikeen was just noting that there are many more players in the field like agnostics, new agers, eastern religions, etc.<br>
<br>
I think the larger issue is that religion is very bad at trying to enforce others to follow its dogma.  James Madison studied to become a minister but ended up speaking out against separation of church and state.  At that time in Virginia, you could receive the <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> death penality</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> for speaking impiously of any articles of Christianity, blaspheming God's name or incorrigible cursing.  Very scary.<br>

People in power are generally thought to have correct ideas, otherwise they wouldn't be where they are at. If the President announced his opinion that there is no god, let's say, then little Johhny at Rodent Flea High School may be influenced to question his faith. Why?

By praying aloud you are telling someone &quot;this is what I believe&quot;. You are not telling someone &quot;you are wrong.&quot; We honor all faiths in this country,  therefore it is perfectly ok to express your own personal beliefs as long as you do not criticize someone else's.<br>

<br>
Even the more reason not to pray in public as an official, since it is a confession of <b>personal</b> beliefs. <b>Not</b> a confession of public beliefs.<br>
<br>
<i>"By praying aloud you are telling someone "this is what I believe".</i><br>
<br>
Many of us don't care, really. Personal beliefs are just that, personal.<br>
<br>
<i>"You are not telling someone "you are wrong."</i><br>
<br>
I believe you are understating the power one has when in public office, or when a public official. Especially the power one has over children. I don't know how old you are Rheaton, but when I was growing up if it was found out that a school teacher didn't support the Vietnam War, some of us children believed the teacher was a communist? Why? Because our elders in government told us so. Furthermore, you wouldn't believe how many people I have talked with arugue that the United States is a "Christian" country because we have "In God We Trust" minted on our currency. What does that say? Of course, it is a means to disenfranchise non-Christians. That is an abuse of power. I wouldn't expect you to see that, since you are part of the majority. All I can say is it is easy being in the majority, you don't have to see discrimination on religious grounds.<br>
<br>
<i>"Praying in the senate is telling everyone "this is my faith" and is not a denouncement of other faiths or beliefs."</i><br>
<br>
Why the hell can't people just <i>say</i> "this is what I believe" when <b>asked</b>? If praying is a personal confession, then I don't want to hear your prayers. Plain and simple. I also don't need you confessing to your god on my behalf. I don't need Christians praying for my children, too.<br>
<br>
Furthermore, when license is given for a senate prayer, it means that all involved should agree that the prayer is being given on their behalf. Right? But it is ludicrous to believe that not only everyone in the senate chamber believes about god in the same way as the prayer giver, but that the prayer is even efficacious for the public at large. Indeed, the arrogancy involved in thinking one can offer a public prayer on behalf of all Americans is mind boggling, at the least. <p><center><font face="arial" color="CCFFFF">Lurikeen Mali'Kyre</FONT></center><center><table style='Filter: Shadow(Color=#150517, Direction=225)'><tr><td><span class='Necromancer'><font size=2 color="red" face="arial"><i>NECROMANCER</span></td></tr></table></font></i></center><center><font face=arial></center><center><I>"My eyes will pierce your soul, then I will take your life!"</I></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uquath.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Quath</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 48<br> <font color=#E9D756>(6/4/02 2:48:39 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=302.topic&index=73>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Waaaaaazup!</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> If the President were to go on TV and announce there is no God... he would be giving his opinion, but at the same time he would be refuting someone else's beliefs....

<br>
I think it largely depends on the prayer.  While religions may have common roots, they are in general exclusive.  So if a President prays for Jesus to look kindly on our country, he is refuting other people's beliefs.  He is refuting Muslims, Jews, atheists, Hindus, Buddhist, etc since he/she is showing a religious view that is in opposition to their beliefs (or nonbeliefs). <br>

<br>
Imagine if the president were to televise a prayer to Allah (in Arabic?) or perhaps one of those prayers to Lucifer or the Horned God. Many Christians would be terribly offended and there would probably be a huge public outcry. Perhaps some would be more accepting of different religious views, but I suspect all would feel at least somewhat uncomfortable. All non-Christians are going to feel some of that discomfort whenever a public figure makes a statement or prayer which assumes the existance and worship of Jesus. Seeing &quot;In God We Trust&quot; on money may cause a similar feeling.<br>
<br>
The 1989 figures used in the 2001 in the CIA factbook list religious beliefs in the US as Protestant 56%, Roman Catholic 28%, Jewish 2%, other 4%, none 10%. It probably doesn't reflect as stronly on belief, but levels of church attendance are probably <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.religion-online.org/cgi-bin/relsearchd.dll/showarticle?item_id=237">much lower</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> than the 40% that these (voluntary) surveys report.<br>

<br>
However <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Thanks for sharing the prayer.  <br>
<br>
I find the reaction of the senators somewhat amusing, and more than a little sad.  Amusing because the shock probably was printed on their faces!  <br>
<br>
Sad because a very intolerant individuals walked out.<br>
<br>
Someone on the first page mentioned Satanic Worship and animistic worship.  While I walk out during a prayer for either of those and log a complaint, had the prayer been any other religion - I simply would not have participated.<br>
<br>
Many on these boards speak of the arrogance and intolerance of Christains, yet don't see the same possiblity in those of a different/no faith.<br>
<br>
<br>
Anyways.<br>
<br>
One thing.  First page.  Of course, said by Lurikeen, like he needed to ask =p<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Even Jesus spoke against public prayers<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Actually, he didn't speak out against public prayer.  He advocated corporate prayer - in Acts it mentions several times how the apostles carried on praying, taking communion, teaching, and being in fellowship together as a vital part of a spirtual life.<br>
<br>
However, Jesus was very much against any type of <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> formalized</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> public prayer, i.e. mindlessly repeating the Lord's Prayer with no thought whatsoever in a church every single Sunday. (Please don't take offense everyone who does this, kk?  Keep in mind I said mindlessly repeating ok?).  Jesus gave us that prayer to teach us how to pray - whom to pray to (our father), who dwelled in a Holy place not of this sin-filled earth (who art in Heaven), Giving glory and praising Him (hallowed be thy name).... kk I am sure ya get the picture.<br>
<br>
Point is, public prayer is a necessity for spiritual growth and vitality in a community.  Note its <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> spiritual<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  community I am talking of here.<br>
<br>
Anyways, ya knew I just had to stick my finger in this discussion, didn't you?  Stir up the pot so to speak.<br>
<br>
<br>
Lastly, two questions Lurikeen.<br>
<br>
Why do you find it arrogant for someone of any relgion, but especially Christianity, to state their beliefs as truth?  I ask because: 1)  whenever there is a post regarding anything Christian, the first thing you point out is the arrogance of the faith.  2)  I don't believe that stating something I believe to be truth is arrogant.  I believe God exists, Jesus died for our sins, and the bible is truth.  However, whenever I have stated that - you called me arrogant.  I really want to know - how do you clssify that as arrogant.  Simply because I have investigated other religions or lack thereof, and placed my faith in one, does not mean that I am arrogant.  It means I think I know the truth.  I ask because it has to be more than simple disagreement on your part.  <br>
<br>
Second question:  why, if you are an atheist, do you answer so many religiously themed posts?  I am simply curious on this one.  Is it the stimulation fo the debates, or are you trying to explain another side, or?<br>
<br>
Well, signing off.<br>
<br>
As always, no spell check or anything.<br>
<br>
As always, it takes time to get back if a response is required.<br>
<br>
As always, don't freak or take offense.  if you take offense, I probably didn't write it very well.<br>
<br>
And as always, I do not respond to flaming or completely sarcastic responses designed to belittle what I said.  There is no point, play elsewhere.<br>
