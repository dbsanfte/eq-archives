Unlike Brutas, I respect nothing about you.  Nothing about you is worthy of respect, evident by the depths to which you will stoop.<br>
<br>
That’s okay though, because your posts had me looking through the Bible.. which is never a waste of time.  Plus there are lots of people who share the opinion of your better personality so someone may read it and find their way to salvation.  So, thanks for spurring me on to good works, not works that save me, mind you - just fruit that comes from being in a saved relationship with God.<br>
<br>
To be honest, towards the end all I could think of Curran was "how can someone know the scripture and be so blind to what it really says", but once I knew it was you the blindness was easy to explain.<br>
<br>
Sad part is that you proved that you can communicate on a semi-intelligent level with a little more civility, but you choose not to.<br>
<br>
Was just realising how telling it is that I play a cleric purely to keep people from losing exp and you play a necromancer to suck the life out of everything.<br>
<br>

BTW, Cendan. If your puny mind would allow you to actually understand words written in the English language you would have read that you pretty much wouldn't accept a word Lurikeen said. Even when Lurikeen was civil with you. <br>

Oh, I can read. You are the one with problems. Here is a perfect example.<br>
<br>
<font color=yellow>Oh, and I also play a Cleric (Locutes Aderlass). Some of us, unlike half wits like you, can play multiple characters. And, what sort of Character one plays is not an indicator of who the person is in RL you fucking goo brain.</font color><br>
<br>
The problem here is that you missing the point, as you always do. Where did I say that characters indicate who we are? I was in fact simply comparing your personality to your character choice. I was clearly stating that you like to suck the life out of things and therefor necromancer was a good choice for you in game.<br>
<br>
You only see what you want to see.<br>
<br>
Then there is the fact that you could read my sig and know that I am capable of playing "multiple characters." Unless, of course you meant different real life characters... but then I am happy with mine so I don't have to... diversify.<br>
<br>
Now, as far as not accepting a word Lurikeen said; am I to understand that because I wouldn't accept your misinterpretations you went and made up some alter ego who you then used to spout out things you don't believe?  The point of that was...?<br>
<br>
Then there is the obvious fact that your "civil" and my "civil" are very different. Lurikeen was most certainly not civil, and when he/you (depending on your current personality) decided to apologize it was something to the effect of "Sorry that I was mean, I didn't take into consideration that you were a loser and your life sucks."<br>
<br>
Gee, why didn't I accept that apology?<br>
<br>
Keep trying, but try harder. <br>
<br>
Oh, and by the way, when you create an alter ego in the future you will be more convincing if you:<br>
<br>
1. Don't make yout first post here after your alter ego's posts get stale.<br>
2. Don't create a global account the day that you decide to start posting.<br>
3. Don't stop making digs with your main account that you would normally make and then continue posting on other topics in the same thread.  <p><table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" height="1">

  Cendan, do you feel that you might have been worshiping EQ there for awhile?  Hmm, let me see; I estimate that you probably played approximately 180 days total.  That about right?  I'm sure at least 120 days.  Didn't you say you had a wife, a couple ex's and many important friends in your life?  You sound kind of alone to me.  All that truth and no love=loneliness.  Oh, thats right, you weren't alone.  You were with God 10% of the time, friends 10%, your wife 10% and EQ 60%.  OH shit I forgot, you eat, sleep and shit too.  SO cut that wife, friends and God back about 4% a piece and see what you get.  That would be 6,6,6 and 78 respectively.  Who is your God?   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uquath.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Quath</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 10<br> <font color=#E9D756>(2/15/02 12:20:38 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=269.topic&index=245>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: re: Expectations and consequences of God</span><hr size=1> Don't make me have to put people in time out.<br>

I think you have demonstrated beyond reasonable doubt that you are about as closed minded as they come. Must I go back and quote what many others have stated in this thread with regards to your closed mindedness? Cendan, you would likely be one of the first to try to crucify Jesus if he did return because some how or the other he would say something contrary to your interpretation of the Bible.<br>

I am shocked that you can actually read your own sig! I, for one, thought you had someone write the sig for you, since you certainly don't demonstrate any brain power to be able to pull it off yourself. Oh, did you forget that you had a level 13 Necromancer listed? You life sucker you! Or, is that cock sucker?<br>

Your truly do think you are that important. Fact of the matter is numb nuts (if you do actually have a pair, which I doubt) I could care fucking less whether or not you accept a word I say. I truly had things I wanted to share with you low life, but knew beyond doubt that &quot;Lurikeen&quot; would not be heard. And, it looks like I am correct, by your own addmission you were challenged enough about your view to have to go look up what I was saying. You are just so dull minded you couldn't even share that tid bit up front with Curran. Loser!<br>

It took me a lot less time than you think since I learned very quick how to level.<br>
<br>
I did, however, play more than I should have.  So whats your point?  Read what I have written all along.  Christians aren't perfect.  <br>
<br>
Yes, I am married.  My wife also played EQ with me a lot.  Not to mention that she likes to read so she would get a book, pull up a chair and seldom be more than 3 feet from me... if you really care to know.<br>
<br>
As far as Ex's... people grow up.  Despite being friends with them we are pretty spread out.  College, marriages, jobs.  Friends, well if they also play EQ then what is the problem?<br>
<br>
To be honest, I don't care if you think I sound lonely.  I told you I am not, and I am not.  If you choose to question that then so be it.  I will be happy either way.<br>
<br>
Commenting on my life, which you know nothing about, it just plain ignorant but that okay.  Many people feel better about their lives by inventing problems in the life of others...  so if it makes you feel better then I am really a recovering drug dealer, but I saved well and I am now bribing my jail warden to let me spend most of my time on the library computer.<br>
<br>
As far as your percentages.  First off 6+6+6+78 =  _____ ?  Come on math wiz.. show me what you got.  But WAIT, its gets better!  When you subtract 4% from each of the 10% categories you have reclaimed 12%.  When you add 12% to the 60% of the time I obviously spent playing EQ you get... drum roll please... 72%.  So not only did you not notice the missing 4% but in reality you are missing 10%.  If you are going to use percentages its a good idea to account for all 100%.<br>
<br>
Lastly, being with God is 100%.  You don't log on EQ and God takes a vacation.. so that isn't an issue.   Who is MY God?  Same God as you... I just choose to have a relationship with Him.   <p><table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" height="1">

You calling Jesus close minded is a choice you have to deal with, not me.  I simply read the verses.  Notice no one has yet answered what the verses mean other than what I have said they do.  <br>
<br>
Once again you are predictable, work on it.  I knew you would bring up my necromancer.  Once again I didn't say that you are a bad person because you played a necro.  Simply that you are a life sucker so its a good choice for your character.<br>
<br>
Since I am not that way it does not apply, but even beyond that I only played my necro to level 13.  Who is my main?  Who is your main?  So if you are going that route then who would MOST represent you?  Whatever.<br>
<br>
<font color=yellow>And, it looks like I am correct, by your own addmission you were challenged enough about your view to have to go look up what I was saying. You are just so dull minded you couldn't even share that tid bit up front with Curran. Loser!</font color><br>
<br>
Sorry, thought that was a given.  How many times have I told you in these posts that I am not real intelligent, that I have a horrible memory?  Did you think I was fishing for compliments?  Or just being down on myself?  I was telling the truth.  I went and I looked up the verses to double check that I wasn't going beyond what was said.  It had nothing to do with my "view" being challenged.<br>
<br>
<font color=yellow>My civility ended with you Cendan</font color><br>
<br>
Heh, you clueless wonder, your civility never began.  I don't care what you told me.  If I say I am wearing jeans and I am wearing shorts... you gonna say "oh, they must be jeans then cause he said so"?   Didn't think so.  Don't tell me you are sincere and insult me in the same breath and expect me to accept your idea of an apology.<br>
<br>
I am 6'2", but then... your guesses about me are as accurate as your guesses on God's existence, His word, and just about everything around you.  At least you offer some comical relief.<br>
<br>
Oh no... people who read the Bible and then change what it says to suit their needs call me close minded?  Oh no.  People claim the Bible says things and then can't prove it with the verses call me close minded because I won't just believe them? Oh no.  People who don't even acknowledge their creator call me close minded? Oh what ever will I do???<br>

There you go again, taking one sentence out of context.  Let me explain it for your addled mind.  I show someone a verse in the Bible and then you call me close minded because I wont accept what they have to say that is contrary to what He says.  So in effect you are calling Him close minded.  I know that was clear to you, but thats okay, I will play your little game to make you look even less credible.<br>

 Cendan, I believe there is an herbal remedy for stupidity, you might look into finding it: you are in dire need. You are closed minded because you are not OPEN to what anyone else here has to say about the Bible. You have literally trashed everyone's ideas presented in this forum while touting yours as truth. Then you come off saying that I said, "Jesus is close minded" when I had said you are. Now you are scrambling with faulty reasoning trying to justify your obvious mistake.</font color><br>
<br>
Come on Lurikeen, you have to be able to do better than that.  Your insults are soooo trite, and not even creative.  <br>
<br>
I am open to discussion.  Tell me what you think the verses mean and I won't give you my opinion, I will show you what other scriptures say to prove what they are truly saying.  <br>
<br>
I made no mistake.  I stand by the meaning of my words.  If I show you what Jesus says in the Bible and you choose to say it says something completely different... yet have no proof, then you are close minded.  When you say that I am close minded for not having an "I'm okay, you're okay" mentality then you are calling Jesus close minded... because HE makes the rules.<br>
<br>
<font color=yellow>I am sure you are surprised to learn that an atheist can actually have Christian friends. Considering you have a rock in your skull masquerading as a brain it is a wonder you even understand what a friend is, let alone understand what an open mind is. </font color><br>
<br>
Now I know this is over your head but consider the context that you are spouting off from.  First of all having friends that consider themselves Christian is not surprising, except in the context of your friends puting up with you attitude.  What is surprising is that you said you don't want to send friends to the church I attend.  Now, if they are Christians and they are friends (thus knowing you are an athiest) then why in the world would they take the advice on a church from an Athiest?  How would you judge a church? <p><table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" height="1">

Hmmm... I like the Middle English "adel" since it nicely describes you as a person, Cendan. :D At any rate, dumb fuck I can't expect that you would know how to read a dictionary and your little lie is telling of your character. I have no reason to even try to enter into debate with you because you appear prone to modifying definitions to suit your own purpose. Should we continue? <p>Lurikeen Mali'Kyre<BR>

A scholar just doesn't pick out an extraordinary use of a word to support their view as you did. And seeing that makes me truly wonder how you treat reading the Bible.<br>

So, sure. Addled can be used as an adjective, or even as a noun. But it is properly used as a verb.<br>

<br>
There it is. Have at it. Flame away. Let's read more of "Lurikeen you are so predictable", "I told you to keep your mouth shut", etc. etc.<br>

Wow you are a moron.  Let me school you here.  Over on the right side of your screen you will see what is called a scroll bar.  When compared to the scroll bar that is at the bottom of the screen when viewed material is wider than the window which contains it, it would be refered to as the "vertical scroll bar."<br>
<br>
You can click down with your left mouse button on the darker portion of this bar and drag downwards to see material lower in the box OR you can use the cute little arrows at the top and the bottom.  This is called "scrolling"<br>
<br>
Now that we have learned that little lesson.  You will note that if you go to www.dictionary.com and type in "addled" you will come to this page: http://www.dictionary.com/search?q=addled<br>
<br>
Once at this page you will note that it says "3 entries found for addled."<br>
<br>
The first 2 are actually for the word "addle" which is a verb.  So you got something right.  But the problem here is that I said "addled" which is an adjective.  You will note that THAT is what the 3rd entry lists.<br>
<br>
So, I copied and pasted your link to your dictionary and it didnt open.  Does that make you a liar? No.  It means that you probably copied a link once you got where you were going but they don't allow direct linking.  <br>
<br>
Either way I typed in www.m-w.com and typed in "addled" and received no definition.  Its obviously an over site.  Strangely enough I went to the internet search engine www.hotbot.com (tried a few others but some didn't list number of found sites) and received 24,800 matches (feel free to check since you think I am a liar).  <br>
<br>
Now lets be fair here, I am sure that some of those 24,800 registered sites (we aren't including non registered sites here, so there are even more) are not in the context in which I am speaking.  Lets conservatively say that 1% of them are in the context.. that means 48 sources say that addled is a word.  <br>
<br>
So m-w can overlook it, but thats one source.  Not to mention that every year dictionaries like m-w add words.  Why? Because common useage qualifies them for inclusion.  How many examples would you consider common useage?<br>
<br>
If I cared for your opinion I would be offended that you labeled me a liar before checking your facts.  Of course, at this point your unstable relationship with facts has already been established.<br>
<br>
You can like the verb definition all you want, but it seems you have applied it to the wrong person. So? Who is addled now?<br>
<br>
Oh boy, oh boy, was about to post and then saw your new gems of wisdom.  Wow, an extraordinary display.<br>
<br>
<br>
<font color=yellow>You know what Cendan. Forget the above over the dictionary definition for "addled". It is not important. What is important is the type of scholarship you displayed, or better yet the lack of scholarship.</font color><br>
<br>
Lack of scholarship. Puh-leeeeese.<br>
<br>
<font color=yellow>A scholar just doesn't pick out an extraordinary use of a word to support their view as you did. And seeing that makes me truly wonder how you treat reading the Bible.</font color><br>
<br>
Extraordinary?  Um, "addled" is the first word that came to mind, I didnt have to go look something up.  Its funny because I wasn't showing off, in fact I often find my self stumbling for words.. easy words... they just don't come to mind.  Then other times I use words from the context in which i have heard/read them, without having to think about it.  Regardless, the use of that word is surely not extraordinary.<br>
<br>
<font color=yellow>So, sure. Addled can be used as an adjective, or even as a noun. But it is properly used as a verb.</font color><br>
<br>
Properly? Is that your opinion or do you have scholarly proof?  Hurry up and finish your dictionary so m-w and dictionary.com know whom to consult.  If that’s how you think then we should all only be speaking root dialects or are you not aware that American English is a derivative (knew that word but looked up spelling, don’t mind do you?) language.<br>
<br>
<font color=yellow>The real point I was making is that you're just a blithering moron and I can't expect you to practice scholarship, since you don't want to see anybody else's point of view. Let alone work through texts to find proper usage of words (which is very important if one is truly interested in understanding what the writers of the Bible intended to say in their own languages). </font color><br>
<br>
Well, if you want to say that I am a moron… it would be more effective to not point out your own mistakes.  You should brag a little, show me how dumb I am in comparison.  Surely you shouldn’t claim any scholarship and then make such blatant errors.<br>
<br>
I have said it before, I say it again.. I do give you credit for being smarter than your posts.  Tone it down a notch, you are doing the very things you <b>accuse</b> me of.<br>
<br>
I know things you don't, and I know you know lots of things I don't.  It doesn't matter that you do/don't know what addled meant.  What matters is that you jump on me and call me a liar.. when the mistake was not mine.<br>
<br>
<font color=yellow>My advise to you is to stop spreading your ass cheeks for your preacher to plug you. Unless you truly enjoy it of course.</font color><br>
<br>
You continue to stoop.<br>
<br>
I find this ironic since as a Christian my stance on homosexual acts is clear.  I may make mistakes but I assure you that mistaking a man for a woman is not one of them.  Odds are more likely that an athiest would be more likely to accept this... might even talk about it from personal experience.<br>
<br>
Jesus loves you anyway.<br>

So it would be the remainder.  In the first example though (10,10,10,60) you are missing 10% though.<br>
