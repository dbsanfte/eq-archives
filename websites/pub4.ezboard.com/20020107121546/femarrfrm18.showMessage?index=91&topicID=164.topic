<br>
Second of all, I know my duty.  I fully understand my rights and responsiblities as a citizen.  I do not need you, nor anyone else to remind me of that.  I very clearly stated this in my very first post.<br>
<br>
Thirdly, as I have stated, I do and will support a war to bring justice for the terrible tradgey that occurred a week ago.  But my support ends there.  The current administration is seeking a war on terorism, a war which it seems more likely with each passing minute that will involve more nations than just Afaganistan.  <br>
<br>
Fourthly, you had a choice.  I will not.  As you are so fond of reminding everyone, all male citizens of the U.S. are required to register with the Selective Service at age 18.  This means that, if the draft is reinstated, I will go, whether or not I agree with the conflict.  Pardon me if I want my death to mean something.  Please excuse me if I want to make sure the cause I die for is just and honorable; this is important to me.  I am not a coward, thank you very much.<br>
<br>
I am not going to reiterate my reasons for being hesistant to support a prolonged war on terrorism, as I have explained them well in my previous posts.  <br>
<br>
I am sick and tired of people not thinking through things.  I see it everyday; people just go with what they feel instead of thinking out the proper course of action.  All I am asking here is that we make sure that we are doing the right thing before we fully commit ourselves. <br>
<br>
Oh yeah, Caeser himself didn't actually say that; Shakespeare put those words into his mouth.  <br>
<br>
Voltaire once said, &quot;I may not agree with what you are saying, but I will, to my death, defend your right to say it.&quot;<br>
Now there is a man who could pick his causes.<br>

Those who are opposed should not have to fight.  Ever.  However, they should not necessarily get to enjoy the fruits of all the labor of other.  So how about this scenario.  Anyone who is fit but refuses to fight should be required to take all the meniable jobs of the state.  Animal catcher, sewer cleaner, etc.<br>
<br>
And if I recall history, America was founded by a revolution.  <br>
<br>
A revolution is.....  The overthrow of one government and its replacement with another. <br>
<br>
Therefore, America was founded by starting wars, and is defined by starting wars.  <br>

Triff,<br>

I have a very close friend that believes much as you do.  When you quoted Ayn Rand suddenly everything fit.  I respect your philosophical prowess and the complete understanding you have of you and your actions.  That said, I think what you believe in and choose to further is in direct conflict with the way the world is and, unfortunately, is alien to many.  Every argument you've stated and every retort you've given has been carefully worded, but, nonetheless requires a black and white world.  That &quot;I&quot; am separate from the &quot;whole&quot; is the basis for your arguments, which in only the simplest and shallowest of cases is true.  That theory doesn't look at the ramifications of actions, the genesis of society, technology, culture, and the multitude of interaction, cause and effect.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Humans are not a collective whole. We are individuals, no matter how much anyone tries to change this.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Really? By what measure?  Even the actions of a sociopath are dictated (inherently) by the group, he does them in spite of the group.  To cause pain, frustration and terror amongst the group - he is simply reflecting upon and reacting to the group.<br>
<br>
Every minor action you take in life is the culmination of a multitude of people and their actions. Commuting to work? Posting online?  Rational thought conveyed through correct grammar?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> There are people whose aim is to make themselves happy. They do this because it is painfully obvious that making oneself happy is pleasurable.<br>
There are people who enjoy helping others. They do it for the knowledge and feeling of making someone happy. This amounts to doing it to make themselves happy.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
This I think is the best example of the black and white world in which you wish to live.  I do things to help others, I get pleasure from this - does this negate the value and/or benefits of my aid?  Are people only allowed to feel one way?  Can I not want both?  What of the man that reacts in the moment of crisis without thinking, he saves another and then feels good - but he didn't have enough time beforehand to think it out.  I've felt love and rage at the same time, toward the same person.  We are complicated beings with complicated motives.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Let me say that if I was to have someone beside me in a war, I'd sure as hell prefer the man who has the self-respect to think and live for himself (and to protect with a passion all things that influence this) over a man who doesn't think that he is worth enough to fight for (which is indeed the definition of &quot;selfless&quot<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> , and that the final arbiter of everything is what the majority thinks.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Again, your black and white world.<br>
<br>
I'd want both.  And, I think that both is more realistic.  I believe I have the self-respect to think my actions out, seek my survival and the survival of those around me - but, I also realize the value of the greater (the whole, the collective, etc) and thusly I would sacrifice myself if it would save or further the whole.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> When people speak of serving the majority, or society, or the public, or the whole, or the collective, or whatever name they wish to give it, do you ever stop to think of the exact meaning of those terms?

What that basically leads to is the conclusion that nobody has self-worth. If you are not worth anything, then what could be good in my helping you? What could be good about a majority made up of people who are worthless?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
<br>
Black and white, again.<br>
To &quot;follow that logic&quot; as you say I'd have to leave a considerable portion of my brain and my moral code behind.  Also, according to your own arguments the majority <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> IS</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> worthless.  They have no &quot;value&quot; to you because they do not effect you or yours.  So, by your arguments, the worthless majority is no good and therefore can be done away with (because you wouldn't stand up for them) - there by stripping you of all their &quot;benefit&quot;. Goodbye computer, car, internet, roads, shirt, socks, healthcare, education, etc.<br>
<br>
The &quot;reality&quot;, to me, is we're a mixture of both.  I consider myself a staunch individualist, I hate titles/tags of any kind because I think they curb free-flowing thought. Democrat, materialist, liberal, christian, and, yes, even &quot;individualist&quot; are all labels that serve no purpose but to limit myself and others.  I want to be able to decide for myself what is best and protect the things most vital to me - however, at the same time, I see that none of the things I have or the freedom with which I express myself are free.  They did come at a price.  We as a whole enjoy these freedoms, we as a group depend on these freedoms and would hate life itself if we were suddenly without these freedoms.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Let me say again that those people didn't give me freedom.

<br>
I'll tackle the &quot;taking freedom away bit&quot; next.  First, so the defense of your feedoms isn't worth anything?  Whether they procured it or defended it is largely semantics... 6 in one, half-dozen the other. Glass is half-emty or half-full.  Without their defense you would have lost those freedoms, so you do, in fact, owe them your freedom by this very argument.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> America didn't give me my rights. Every reasoning being is born with them...<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Really? There are a many anthropologists, sociologists, historians, philosophers, and geneticists that would benefit from your keen insight.  I was under the impression (incorrectly, apparently) that our freedoms were the result of an enlightened mankind.  A long and painful sociological evolution.  That &quot;america&quot; &quot;gave&quot; us the rights is somewhat moot, it's the fact that &quot;america&quot; &quot;allows&quot; us to actively engage in and promote these freedoms is what makes it so great.  The America we enjoy today is the culmination of centuries worth of blood, sweat, intent, debate, and innovation.<br>
<br>
A baby doesn't know what freedom is.  It doesn't even know what &quot;reasoning&quot; is.  &quot;Reason&quot; is an evolution of thought that didn't happen in a vacuum, it happened in societies of men (and women), so therefore it owes it's existence to many people and does NOT come readily equipped with a newborn baby.  Most sociologists and anthropologists believe if you deprive a child of mores and education you'll end up with a being bent on self gratification without regard for his/her future and surroundings.... sound familiar?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  and a man's rights should never be taken away from him unless he violates the rights of someone else.

<br>
This word &quot;rights&quot; I do not think it means what you think it means.<br>
If you are a citizen of a country and that country showers you with freedoms that most of history didn't have, then that country tells you part of the responsibility for having these freedoms is that you must go to war if a draft is instated then those are your rights.  When it comes time and the draft is instated and you are ordered to war there is no loss of rights.. you knew at the onset what were your rights and what were the responsibilities should the draft be instated.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> And I'm not asking anyone else to go fight for me. It's their own decision to fight.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Actually, you <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> ARE</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> asking them to.  If you won't go to prevent the revocation of your rights then someone else must go.  If everyone chose as you do then your rights would be revoked.  Do you follow?  Thank goodness not everyone believes as you do and they are willing to fight for you as well, in addition to themselves.  You are leaching on their good will or self-gratification, however you wish to rationalize it (and yes, I realize they are doing it for themselves, but they are <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> also</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> doing it for you).<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Do at least you understand that rebelling against a draft is a form of fighting to defend myself and my freedom?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I understand it, but I think it's invalid.  Your freedom is dependent upon those around you - defending freedom or procuring freedom, either way it has the same effect.<br>
<br>
You value your freedom above all else - a very noble idea.  But, the very fact you have those freedoms and are able to actively exercise them is owed to this country, and thus owed to those who started it and defended it.<br>
<br>
Enjoying those freedoms without paying the due (that society has decided) is greedy and soulless.  It's stepping on the actions of others and spitting on the graves of those that gave theirs lives to prevent the revocation of your rights.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> I don't wish a draft on anyone. It's not just wrong for me; it's wrong for anyone to be forced to fight for someone else.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I sincerely doubt the draft will be instated.<br>
<br>
But, I think what you're missing is that you're not being asked to fight <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> just</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> for someone else.<br>
You're being asked (told) to fight for someone else, yourself, the whole, and, above, all the nation/organization/institution/situation that gives you the rights you value so highly.<br>
<br>
Is not the preservation and furtherance of that society paramount?  &quot;America&quot; is just a tag.  Think of it however you choose, freedom of thought, expression, movement, and life are incredible ideas, things we enjoy and take for granted.  So isn't the existence of that state of freedom an imperative?  It manifests itself in practical terms as America and the defense of its interests/borders.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> For what little I have of it, personally, I pay the tax money that funds the intelligence agencies and military to do the jobs they signed up to do.

<br>
So you boil your rights down to a monetary exchange.  How quaint.  You've just put a price on the defense of your rights and freedoms.<br>
<br>
So for X amount of (tax) money you get Y freedoms.<br>
<br>
Initially no one is forcing you to take those jobs.  I believe everyone hopes it stays that way.  But, most people are willing to do those jobs if the situation becomes dire enough.<br>

<br>
No one is asking you not to think. Hell think all you want. All we ask is for you to realize that the freedoms you enjoy did come with a price and that one day you may be asked to live up to that price.<br>

I enjoy those freedoms daily.<br>
I enjoy those freedoms so much that they are the most important things to me.<br>
I enjoy these freedoms so much that they are more important than America.<br>
I would let America and Americans die by the hundreds, no thousands... no, millions (they have to effect me) before I raised a finger.<br>
I would let everything around me change for the worst as long as it doesn't have any bearing on me.<br>
<br>
How idealistic.  How unenlightened.  How soulless.<br>

<br>
US is deteriorating? Only if you watch the 6 o'clock news. If you look at our evolution as a society we're doing phenomenally well.  As much as we cry about rampant crime, recession, and moral decay the truth is none of those is a shadow of what existed before.  Even the cries of recession that are echoing about the halls of Wall Street are, in fact, very minimal in the larger scope of things.  It would take something catastrophic to send us into a another Depression, anything less than that is excellent in comparison.<br>
<br>
Hell, I cheered when the dot com craze crashed.  Far too many people jumped on that bandwagon hoping for free rides, nothing is that simple - life is never black and white.<br>
<br>
This isn't saying we're pefect, far from it.  But, all-in-all we're doing great.<br>
<br>
Back on track.  Simply, you enjoy the benefits of our society, deny they were bought/paid for in one way or another, and you will drink of those rights plentifully without a nod to those who procured/defended/established the ability for you to even have those rights.<br>

Yes, and I stand by the fact that you don't grow your own food.<br>
Your nourishment is owed to your appetite - but is also owed to the farmer that harvested the crop.<br>

You want things simple, black and white. Sorry.<br>

<br>
Wake up here folks.  SOMEONE at SOME POINT has to have the balls to say we have to TRY to ferret out these terror organizations.  THE WHOLE DAMN WORLD has agreed to that with the exception of a small minority who, to be honest, are just more consumed with fear for their own personal safety or with some sort of self-loathing martyr complex to care.<br>
<br>
I guess you will &quot;fight&quot; when the anthrax hits the air you breath in the hometown that you always felt was nice and safe because others (who may have never even seen it) were willing to die to protect it.<br>
<br>
As for how unimportant oil is.  Sell your car, stop using public transportation, cancel your electricity and home heating oil and SELL YOUR DAMN PC because ALL of these &quot;luxuries&quot; are a direct result of fossil fuel.  It makes me laugh to hear the complaints of how &quot;all the US cares about is oil&quot; when 99% of Western civilization requires oil for its very existance.<br>
<br>
No one is calling for an all out massive world war here (who in their right mind would want that?).  The government has made it quite clear that this &quot;war&quot; will be far more like the &quot;war&quot; on drugs only HOPEFULLY far more effective.<br>
<br>
As for the argument of the &quot;philosophy of one&quot;, I say this:<br>
<br>
Anyone who is posting their belief in the &quot;philosophy of one&quot; on a computer attached to the damn internet is full of shit.<br>
<br>
If you truly believe that you don't need anyone save yourself and &quot;your own&quot; than pack up, move to the tundra, live off the land and prove it.  Don't sit here consuming societies resources and then make some abstract academic argument about how you should not have any responsibility to society save that which you choose because you are an Individual.<br>
<br>

<br>
Oh, and nice post Ceru. There's some really insightful, thought-provoking stuff in this thread.<br>
<br>
Conscription in Australia (where I live) was abolished shortly after I was born, and current legislation makes it fairly hard to re-introduce (the Governer-General can do so, but only during a time of war and it must be ratified by both houses of parliment). In 1992, provisions for Conscientious Objection were changed such that one can  object to one war in particular was acceptable grounds rather than all wars in general. To the extent to which I agree with Triff, I think this covers my objections to conscription. I don't want to get drafted to go to war with New Zealand because Helen Clark turns John Howard down for a date, or some such rubbish. I suspect the CO provisions in the US don't cover this however. I do find it rather odd that both countries exclude theological students and ministers from being conscripted to the military. For those of a faith which prohibits them to go to war, CO should cover them. If it's because of the (care/counselling/etc) services they perform in the community or some such, well why students, and what of those who provide similar service without the religious aspects? And don't soldiers need chaplains and the like too?<br>

<br>
Not all religions prohibit entering the military.<br>
<br>
Say for example Jehova witnesses. Their religion prohibits them from joining the military, therefore no religious figure from that religion would be required to be on hand for people of that religion. <br>

I just realized I responded without even saying anything to Cerulean.<br>
<br>
Simply put, all I've been doing for the past week (god it seems like the terrorism happened a long time ago) is posting on boards, and I've now reached the point where I've pretty much lost interest and patience in continuing this particular argument about drafts.<br>
<br>
I will say that, judging by the posts I've seen by you, we disagree fundamentally, Cerulean.<br>
<br>
One thing I <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> would</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> like to quickly answer, though:<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Quote:</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
    I stand by the fact that when one man eats, it is only he that is nourished, and<br>
    no one else, no matter how much he eats.<br>
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Yes, and I stand by the fact that you don't grow your own food.<br>
Your nourishment is owed to your appetite - but is also owed to the farmer that harvested the crop.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Nothing is owed to him from me by the time I consume the food, because I already paid that farmer its equivalent in money that <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> I</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> earned with <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> my</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> work. If there was no one to buy food from, then I would grow my own. I'm not dependant on the farmer.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I liked posting my points, and it was interesting to see what kind of responses I got (and from what people). But as far as I can see right now, I won't really be posting anything else in this thread. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ucarathosollathir.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Carathos Ollathir</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/image/globalRainbow.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 652<br> <font color=#E9D756>(9/19/01 12:45:19 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The sad situation we find ourselves in...</span><hr size=1> He says for the second time..<br>
