<br>
<br>
If you can't laugh at your troubles, you are fu<b></b>cked. Like Dwarkarn has stated, if you can't look back at something terrible and put a positive spin on it, you are screwed. You're going to have an anxiety-stuck life and never be able to take things lightly. Brecht, if you can NEVER laugh at something related to cars or accidents again for the rest of your life, although understandable, you are going to have severe problems. You will give yourself a complex and wind up seeing a shrink once a week. If you can't let things go, you need to think hard about what your view on things are.<br>
<br>
Fact: THE WORLD TRADE CENTERS ARE GONE. 2000+ PEOPLE DIED.<br>
Fact: THEY AREN'T COMING BACK.<br>
Fact: WE FEEL BAD AND MANY OF US LOST LOVED ONES.<br>
<b>Fact:</b> Nothing is going to undo it now.<br>
<br>
Give this crap a rest already. Cut out the over patriotistic crap. I'm not against having pride in your country, but there is a point where it becomes ludacris.<br>
<br>
For those of you wondering why exactly I posted that image, it isn't because I'm saying "OMG LOL RAEG AGAINST TEH MACHIENI@# DIE AMERIKKAN PIGZ". It's because I honestly want people like Warren to get off their high horse and give it a break already. I mean, I understand where this thread is coming from, don't get me wrong. It was nicely written and a nice gesture, however: SHUT UP. Let it go. Basically your post boils down to "It has been 8 months, are you a better person yet?" Oh, please. Because of what happened in New York I should be a better, more understanding person? Doubt it.<br>
<br>
My only point here is to everyone but Dwarkarn: <b>Learn to laugh at yourself, your mishaps, your mistakes, your accidents, your tragedies, and the sad points in your life or else you are never going to be able to fully recover from them and just say "Well, that's life! I wonder what'll happen tomorrow?</b><br>
<br>
p.s. If you agree with my views, I suggest you visit www.somethingawful.com. You will find it very, very funny. It is a satirical site. The forums, although registration costs $10, are worth every penny. If it is possible for you to be offended, however, <b>don't even think about going there or I beat you over the head with a 2x4</b>. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ucarathosollathir.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Carathos Ollathir</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/image/globalRainbow.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 1710<br> <font color=#E9D756>(6/1/02 8:14:24 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: From a profoundly cynical person...</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> If you can't let things go, you need to think hard about what your view on things are.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Oh?  So, we should just forget it ever happened?  WRONG!  The second you forget about it, those that died not only did so tragically, but they did so in vain.  I had a professor that used to say &quot;those that ignore history are doomed to repeat it.&quot;  I admit it, we got cocky.  As a whole we believed that we were the only super power left in the world and that no one would dare attack us on our soil.  We were wrong.  And the more people that would forget this incident, the easier we make it for them to do it again.<br>
<br>
Putting a positive spin on a tragedy does NOT equal making jokes about it.  The positive spin was people pulling together to help.  Whether it was the crews at the site clearing the wreckage and looking for survivors, or those that donated blood or supplies or money, or even those that started to take a little more pride in their country.  I know that most were just jumping on the bandwagon, but not all.<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Brecht, if you can NEVER laugh at something related to cars or accidents again for the rest of your life, although understandable, you are going to have severe problems<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Please, tell us what problems he's going to encounter.  I'd really like to know what problems he's going to have if he doesn't end up laughing at people getting seriously injured or dying in automobile wrecks.

Don't fault Warren because he learned something from this event, fault yourself because you didn't.  I just can't look at something like this and say &quot;@#%$ happens.&quot;  I'm sorry that you think life is just one big joke, but until YOU learn to take some things seriously, then it will be YOU with the problems. <p>Carathos Ollathir<br>

How...<br>
<br>
Well, ..sappy.<br>
<br>
Now, I'm not here to debate Warrens eloquence, for it was very touching, and moving; but then again, so are good televangelists, but I'm not going to get my credit card number just yet.<br>
<br>
While I can understand the sensitivity of America when our country is attacked by the cowardice of a weaker nation, I don't see us shedding tears of Hiroshima or Nagasaki. In fact, this entire problem is not the loss of human life, but the loss of american human life, and to me that is the epitome of tasteless.<br>
<br>
I am a very crass man, and I hold very few things as sacred in my heart, but to revere the life of a thousand souls you never met over a thousand souls you never met based on their geographic locale is pure idiocy. I understand that life has variant degrees of importance, I'd be ripped to shreds if my wife, child, or parents were killed by any means, but I'd hold the same compassion for a stranger across town dying as I would in New York or even in Pakistan.<br>
<br>
The reality is posts like these are a trap, designed to induce sappy feelings and holier-than-thou attitudes. I feel that Warrens compassion is a very beautiful thing, but the overall syndicated waah attitude in this post reeks of followership.<br>

<br>
I think what Warren was getting at is the beauty of day to day life and how we can be thankfull. He used 9/11 as the backdrop to his message as to why life is so precious. I believe his message was a reminder to all of us who get wrapped up in flaming the sh<i></i>it out of each other, or for those who think that only their particular viewpoint counts as unadulterated truth, that there is more to life than winning debates on a game board, or just frying people out of sheer boredom. We should not be so serious as to lose our sense of humor about life, neither should we laugh at the suffering of others.<br>
<br>
I laugh at myself thinking how serious I take the game or this board at times. There are other times where I am thankful I can read another's perspective (such as Warren's) about life and take something good away from it.<br>

The quote is from Ernest Hemingway.<br>
<br>
I think it states in eloquent but straight-up, in your face, simple terms what changes are wrought in life and how important it is to adapt to them. <br>
<br>
If you doubt that the world has changed because of 9-11, then you are living in the dark and have a poor understanding of the basics of society, government and the human mind. <br>
<br>
If you agree that the world has changed, then ask yourself this: Have you changed with it? <br>
<br>
I would never name myself as an especially compassionate individual and I am therefore in no place to encourage undue compassion in others. <br>
<br>
However, this is not about compassion, this is about recognizing a change in the way people live there lives and governments wage their wars. I'll ask again...have you changed?<br>
<br>
&quot;The world breaks everyone and afterward many are strong at the broken places. But those that will not break it kills. It kills the very good and the very gentle and the very brave impartially. If you are none of these you can be sure that it will kill you too but there will be no special hurry.&quot; - Ernest Hemingway <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/utoxxthewizard.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Toxx The Wizard</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 421<br> <font color=#E9D756>(6/2/02 6:22:52 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: From a profoundly cynical person...</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> We were wrong<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Please refrain from using the word &quot;we&quot;. I understand you are talking about the USA, but I'd feel more comfortable saying &quot;The US Government&quot;. I for one (As part of your &quot;we&quot;) do not agree that we were the &quot;only super power&quot; and that &quot;no one would dare attack us on our own soil&quot;.<br>
<br>
I feel it sort of puts the blame on the people of this country, rather I feel the Goverment is at fault.<br>

I stoped playing EQ because of people i thought where friends and turned out not to be and really hurt my feelings. Bahhh i am babbiling i am sure but the point i wanted to make is that 911 SHOULD  have changed everyone and not just in &quot;real life&quot; but in EQ to, yes your char is just a pixel but the one playing the char is a person with feelings.<br>
