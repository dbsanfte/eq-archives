I said I chose not to go the route of money in life because I like to dedicate myself to arts, which would not be possible had a chosen a different route. I merely stated that it is a bullshit excuse that it is unfair to tax the rich more, because despite their taxes the greater part of a tax burden falls on the poor, it is simple math not Voodoo economics. See the problem with conservatives is the bottom line. I bet Will Shakespeare never made as much money as slave traders. (not comparing myself to him just using him as an example because of the times he lived in) The slave trade was as legal as sludge dumping is now. By Cenelron's standards Shakespeare was a waste and slave traders the true deffinition of success. <br>
<br>
Why get rid of the epa, because it doesn't do its job right. For the love of God man, Last year was the first year to mankind's knowledge the North Pole melted. The government just released statistics saying every human born since 1951 has recieved radiation from nuclear testing done in Nevada and the Pacific. The Son of a Bush wants to end the endangered species list. He's cut funding for renewable resources last year, becuase they are not feasible even though Woody Harrelson toured the west coast speaking about them in a hemp oil powered bus. He's revoked rules that reduced acceptable levels of arsenic in drinking water. He has eliminated the laws to protect coral reefs which grow at about a half an inch a century. Cut funding by 28% for research into cleaner, more efficient cars and trucks. Suspended rules that would have strengthened the government's ability to deny contracts to companies that violated workplace safety, environmental and other federal laws.OK'd Interior Department appointee Gale Norton to send out letters to state officials soliciting suggestions for opening up national monuments for oil and gas drilling, coal mining, and foresting. Abandoned a campaign pledge to invest $100 million for rain forest conservation. Suspended rules that would require hardrock miners to clean up sites on Western public lands. Pulled out of the 1997 Kyoto Treaty global warming agreement. Cut Environmental Protection Agency budget by $500 million. Proposed to curtail the ability of groups to sue in order to get an animal placedon the Endangered Species List. Rescinded rule that mandated increased energy-saving efficiency regulations for central air conditioners and heat pumps. Abandoned campaign pledge to regulate carbon dioxide (CO2), the waste gas that contributes to global warming. Nominated David Lauriski - ex-mining company executive - to post of Assistant Secretary of Labor for Mine Safety and Health. O.K.'d Interior Secretary Gale Norton to go forth with a controversial plan to auction oil and gas development tracts off the coast eastern of Florida. Announced intention to open up Montana's Lewis and Clark National Forest to oil and drilling. Proposes to re-draw boundaries of nation's monuments, which would technicallyallow oil and gas drilling &quot;outside&quot; of national monuments. Appointed recycling foe Lynn Scarlett as Undersecretary of the Interior. Allowed Interior Secretary Gale Norton to shelve citizen-led grizzly bear re-introductionplan scheduled for Idaho and Montana wilderness. Refused to fund continued cleanup of uranium-slag heap in Utah. Proposes to reverse regulation protecting 60 million acres of national forest from logging and road building. Nominated Linda Fisher - an executive with Monsanto - for the number two job at the Environmental Protection Agency. Canceled 2004 deadline for automakers to develop prototype high mileage cars. Nominated J. Steven Giles - an oil and coal lobbyist - for Deputy Secretary of the Interior. Nominated Bennett Raley - who advocates repealing the Endangered Species Act- for Assistant Secretary for Water and Science. Proposes to ease permit process - including environmental considerations - for refinery, nuclear and hydroelectric dam construction. Washington Post, May 18, 2001. Proposes that $1.2 billion in funding for alternative renewable energy comefrom selling oil and gas lease tracts in the Alaska National Wildlife Reserve. Forced out Forest Service chief Mike Dombeck and appointed a timber industry lobbyist. <br>
<br>
So you see it isn't that the EPA can't do the job the are rquired to. The EPA has actually accomplished a few things however anytime they came close to stepping on the earning power of a billionaire, it was time to change the rules or cut the funding. Why? So he can get a proposed a $2 trillion tax cut, of which 43% will go to the wealthiest 1% ofAmericans. Oh, I hope that doesn't seem like whining again. Tell me are you one of those conservatives who claims moral superiority too? Money at all costs. Is that it. <br>
<br>
Yaay lobbyist? That says it all about you I think. Way to go you law buying heroes. I only think it is not fair that I have to pay for something I didn't use or profit from. Do you understand that in your money talks only language. I do not own a Jet Ski. I have never used one or benefitted from the use of one. Therefore if Ski-doo or corrupts the environment why should I have to pay for it. Isn't it more logical to charge the makers of Jet Skis since they have proven that they are the cause of it and if it happens again those in a same feild will be more likely to be the cause. <br>
<br>
Where the hell do you get that I want to take anything form those who succeed? Have you been following politics so closely that you've learned to twist people's opposing beliefs so that they are always malicious? Jesus, you are a paranoid @#%$! REPEAT...WE ONLY WANT CORPORATIONS TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR ACTIONS. You yourself are going on and on about the importance of making money as being the number one thing, so why would a corproation give 2 shits about abandoning safety and precautions when they can make an extra-million? <br>
<br>
What may I ask is reasonable to you? What this comes down to, for you right wing whackos is what is the value of life. Is a million dollar loss to much to ask a company to not lie about the mercury spill into the public reservoir? <br>
<br>
Actually Chiteng it doesn't matter that we CAN hold CEO's responsible. When Bush took office, a group of his friends from his oil days were facing somewhere like 80 charges for the willfull pollution of site, the subsequent cover up, and the destroying of documents. Unfortunately while all the media was looking for Mark Rich on the ski slopes of France, Bush had the charges reduced down to a petty misdemeanor and the paid their couple thousnad dollar fine and went home. This is one of those sites we may be forced to clean up now. The majority of those execs, I believe sold their stocks and retired millionaire's. True examples of Cenelron's heroes I'd say.<br>
<br>
I admittedly I rip on Bush a lot, but the fear I have of the irrepairable harm this man will cause our environment and foriegn relations is monumental and growing with each report like the one I just read. Truthfully, I think the dem's are almost as bad, even though the conservatives are a tough act to keep up to. To bad the lobbyists run our country so much nobody gives a damn anymore, or else we might see a candidate who listened to the +75% of the country that did not choose our current leader, and will probably not choose our next one. <br>

You haven't come up with anything yet that Bush has done that I disagree with.<br>
<br>
And despite all our evils and our pollution, the average lifespan just keeps going up by leaps and bounds.  Why isn't all your pollution shortening lifespans?<br>
<br>
And I think it has already been pointed out that the point of the budget proposal is not to make corporations responsible for their own pollution, but whether to make another corporation responsible for one corp's pollution.  And I think your response was make them pay for it because they make more money than you and can afford it.<br>
<br>
And at times William Shakespear was quite wealthy...he owned businesses.<br>
<br>
I do disagree with Bush on one aspect, that of oil drilling.  I think the national monuments would survive some drilling and I have no objection to that.  But oil is a finite resource (maybe)and so long as there are plenty of other sources of oil I think we should keep our reserves untouched.  It will be a good thing to have the last of the oil if it ever does run out.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Even Will understood this, thus he entrusted the running of The Globe to others. <br>
<br>
Now as for your mention of Wonder, You say they would go out of business if they didn't have investors. You say that that investment capital is what pays their workers wages, and you said <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> I</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> didn't understand corporations. Well, let's face facts Wonders bread is buttered (figuratively) by bread(literally). Investment capital is almost invariable used for capturing greater shares of the consumer market, via advertising, product placement, promotionals and/or buying of competition. When they gain more of the market, in this case baked goods, profits increase. This does not necessarily create jobs, in fact when smaller companies are absorbed it often eliminates jobs, because it is often cheaper to close down a plant than to retool it to your brands specifications. <br>
<br>
Now since you want only to read that is an argument for taxing rich vs taxing generally and completely ignore the times I point out that it is basically a type of insurance the government takes out on the environment in which those most cost them the money for clean ups are the ones who foot the lion's share of the bill. When one looks at it from that perspective, however, it becomes quite obvious that your &quot;tax the rich and they can't employ&quot; argument is Trickledown Economics. Anyone with foresight or a knowledge of eighties economics knows that Trickledown, Supplyside, or Reaganomics as it is also known does not work in practice. It is truly a utopian concept, but like its counterpoint, communism, it works only on paper. As soon as you throw in the human element into the equation the system breaks down quicker than Ronnie's bowels after his daily BAP treatment.You see any extra money ending up at the top is hardly noticed and will have minimal affect on spending habits in the economy. You give a hundred thousand dollar tax break to Bill Gates or one of the Walton kids and it isn't going to change their daily expenditures. Now take that same one thousand dollars and divide it up amongst one thousand members of the lower and middle class and the majority of it will be pumped back into the economy within a few months. That equates to more bread sold. That is what truly pays the wages of workers at Wonder. I know you want to tell me that similarly that money could have been invested in Wonder, however that will does not increase thier production, so they use it to capture a greater share of the market. Once that money is spent capturing a greater share of a market not growing because of &quot;lack of consumer confidence&quot; (read: penny pinching) there is truly no actual growth. By figuring in the money of investors it leads to a bloating of figures that companies are pressured to reach. When production slows to meet the diminished demands the CEOs who bear the brunt of responsibility are called on to &quot;trim the fat&quot;. Is it ever the true fat that gets trimmed, like corporate salaries and fringe, or the ad budget, or is it more likely to be lay-offs and closings. I think one walk through Flint will answer that. You see ultimately what determines if a company makes it or not is production. Ask all those folks smarter than me that sank their dough in them thar boomin' dotcoms. So yes it is my belief that the rich bearing a perportionate share of the tax burden is the best way to run the system because dividing the taxes evenly where each person pays x% eats up a grater percentage of the poorer classes incomes, thus taking a large portion (90% control only 10% remember) of the demand out of a system built on supply and demand and causing the system to bottom out. So I guess what I am saying is the idea that tax breaks for the rich creates jobs holds about as much ground as the French Resistance.<br>
<br>
Let's face it the talking heads no more about this than us. Do you think there is a reason that nobody post-Reagan mentions supplyside economics, even though Bush Sr., Clinton, Dole, Gore, Bush Jr., hell even Ross Perot, included pieces of it in thier agendas? It is because they spend fortunes on assessing public opinion and the public bristles at the those terms, so the find new more friendly terminology for their plans. Your assessment that the majority of the people not caring  is also a proven fact, because of Bushie's withdrawal from the Kyoto accords that every other civilizied nation has signed, many of the other nations are holding us to standards of unfair business practices, since our companies have lower standards than the rest of the world. This will allow them to place tariffs on our goods. So it is only short-sighted jingoist morons, and those extremely disinfranchised by the sytem where the very lobbyist you cheer on have rendered their words meaningless to their representatives that don't give a crap. The rest of the world certainly does. <br>
<br>
I want to say I do agree with you on the point you don't seem to agree with yourself on...<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u> You haven't come up with anything yet that Bush has done that I disagree with.<br>

Why is it so hard to save that oil, and thus our National Parks and monuments? Why? Because when you appoint the lobbyist to position that were designed to oppose them you get corruption at its peak. Oh yes I know Clinton's environmental record was pretty crappy, in fact I didn't consider him even a liberal untill I saw the true destructive power of real conservatism at work. I was appalled by Clinton's renting out of his values to lobbyist. Bush one upped Clinton by not only not charging them to stay at 1600, but by giving them there own damn office and team of government paid bureaucrats. I guess some times you don't know what you got till it's gone. <br>

Ultimately any plan our appointed leader puts on the table is bound to be special interest laiden because they are the ones righting the bills. I am sure however you will love them all even if the one claiming they can take your property via emminent domain for energy needs takes your land, or is it only when it directly effects you will come crying afoul? So I guess basically in my humble opinion is your arguments are short-sighted, illogical and self serving. I guess you no longer that good..Will Hunting. So how do you like dem apples?<br>

I did not say investment income paid people's wages, get your facts right.  Can you create another fairy tale hypothetical to prove beyond a doubt that companies are evil and investing is the devil?  Your entire post is based on your &quot;Investment capital is almost invariable used for capturing greater shares of the consumer market, via advertising, product placement, promotionals and/or buying of competition&quot; statement.  That is false.  Before Wonder was there, someone had to INVEST and start the company.<br>
<br>
Reaganomics works perfectly.  The 80's is the &quot;me&quot; decade because of the poor economy at the time?  No, the economy had unprecedented long term growth.  That is what got us out of the recession that was hitting as Reagan took office.  They call it something different but it is the same program.<br>
<br>
You are just as narrow minded as the rest of your kind.  Economies are not just about getting people to spend money.  There must be pools of money for expansion and new businesses.  Yes, the economy EXPANDS, it is not a finite pie so that every time one company tries to expand it is just taking jobs away from others.<br>
<br>
You did not come up with any reason to disagree with Bush.  I said that I thought we should not drill certain oil deposits for a different reason, but I put no stock whatsoever in your reasoning.  Is this overly difficult for you to understand?<br>
<br>
As far as lobbyists go it comes down to this....all votes may be equal, but I am glad that those who actually do things have a greater voice in this Republic than those who sit on their ass and say they are more fullfilled that way, but they should tell evryone else what to do with their assets too.<br>
<br>
&lt;shrug&gt; maybe one day I will no longer believe that I too could be sucessfull with some amount of ability, initiative and hard work.  But until that day I will decline to agree with people like you who want to use government as a tool to spend other people's money.<br>

The money used to create a company isn't investment capital the economic term is start up capital. Investment capital is a term used to describe money sunk into an operating business. <br>
<br>
The whole argument for Reaganomics is the &quot;unprecedented growth&quot; lie. It is key in the argument of Rush Limbaugh, a known proven liar who has even admitted to such charges, almost as a point of pride. Well without going back to economics I know that in the fifties the top rate of taxation was over 80% and the growth rate was 4%. Reagan knocked the top rate of taxation to 28% and the economy grew at 2.5%. Cutting the top rate didn't give us this mythological  &quot;unprecedented growth&quot;, it lead to unpre- cedented deficit. Reaganomics did have growth but ultimately that growth lead to a market crash which I said invariable happens. How does a perfect economic system create record deficits and become unstable oh wise one? <br>
<br>
The economy is a finite pie when the bottom disappears which is what ultimately happens when the money doesn't trickle-down. There is obviously a limit to the number of bread companies that can be supported by a finite population of bread consumers. If one expands another must diversify or keep up or die, that is the competitive nature of capitalism, which is good. However when we start rewarding those already at the top there is no room for new companies to enter a saturated market, unless gutsy investors want to take a risk, but ultimatley the risk verse reward does not make that a worthwhile idea. <br>
<br>
As far as lobbyist go, you ultimatley agree that those with the money to buy votes have a right and those who do not posess the ability to buy votes don't deserve as much of a say because they are lazier. That's it isn't whitey. Welath is the number one determining factor on societal worth in your opinion. <br>
<br>
You say those who manipulate the system for their own wealth deserve that and if they screw anyone else well they deserved it for being poor trash and if they do speak up and rally you call them lazy. Perhaps if you didn't come off as some spoiled suburb kid who wants to believe he deserves to be higher paid then women and blacks in the same field one might be able to put some creed into your argument. If they were heavily intoxicated with their own bloated self worth or several bottles of strong mind numbing liquor. <br>
<br>
Its not like a far greater portion of my income isn't going to pay to liberate oil, than to pay for these alleged lazy whiners. Why to protect our economic interests, not to free countries. Unfortunately for you, you live in the United States where all of us stupid laborers have the same vote as our the CEOs. I know politicians have always been in bed with businessmen, but when Bush is done raping the bottom 90% they are going to send him back to Texas to execute them uppity Negroes again quicker than you can say eh...eh...eh...evildoers. <br>
<br>
I fully expect you to not put stock in my reasoning because I use reason and logic and a review of facts and history, not the hate propaganda of self-righteous conservatives. <br>
<br>
Seriously would you cry a foul if they appropriated your assets? Would you come running to those of us who opposed those laws from the start or would you look to your idols in the lobbying industry?  Well, if that ever happens you do know that just as the ACLU has defended hate-mongers who have threatened them when people tried to censor their racist diatribes, we will still be calling these laws unethical and unfair. You see that is the difference between us, these laws will have less effect on me than other people but nonetheless it is wrong and I do not need to wait for it to bite me in the ass to rise to action, but then again I'm just lazy and undereducated, because I have priorities that are not monetary. <br>

Economies are cyclical and it is not feasible to prevent ever having a recession.<br>
<br>
There are booms and there are booms, and your blanket statement that Reaganomics is all about &quot;unprecedented growth&quot; is about as accurate as all investment capital is invariably used to expand by buying out small business....but fair is fair, I guess all donations are used to buy hotel rooms for presidential candidates and thier bimbos, huh?<br>

Yep, if people are allowed to profit and we don't redistribute wealth through taxation eventually a couple of people will have it all and everyone else will starve because nobody can start a new business and there are no jobs....ok, hasn't happened yet but I'm sure it will eventually if we don't do something about this crisis of people having more money than you soon.<br>

If you made the money, you should decide how it gets spent.  But since you could be earning a 6 or 7 figure income if you so chose, you should have less say about how other people's money is spent.<br>

When do we do the hate mongering, between the black killings, environmental rapings, poor rapings.....conservatives should learn to use less hatefull speech like liberals do.

<br>
Not true at all. Even before taxation, wealth is distributed. Someone will need to work the &quot;low paying jobs&quot;. Take a look at the Gini Coefficient before income taxation and after, it isn't all that much changes (Gini coefficient = measure on inequality in an economy).<br>
<br>
In fact, the reason it doesn't change &quot;that much&quot; is because income taxation is one of the few forms of progressive taxation. Most other taxes are &quot;head/poll&quot; taxes, and therefore, &quot;regressive&quot; in a sense. A 15% tak on a loaf  of bread for someone making $10,000 a year is a lot more then someone making $1000,00 a year.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> The economy is a finite pie <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
The economy is not a finite pie, it's growth in infinite over the long run. Through innovation and productivity growth, theoritically, economic growth is infinite.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> There is obviously a limit to the number of bread companies that can be supported by a finite population of bread consumers<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Right. But because there are a finite number of consumers, that DOES NOT mean that the opportunity for economic growth is also finite. You could, instead, improve the quality of the bread and charge $1 more for the bread, resulting in economic growth. This type of growth is infinite. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  one expands another must diversify or keep up or die, that is the competitive nature of capitalism, which is good.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Of course, one of my favourite economists, Schumpeter famous theory of &quot;creative destruction&quot;, which simply states that in the long run, if you are to survive, you must change and adapt to be competitive. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> However when we start rewarding those already at the top there is no room for new companies to enter a saturated market<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I don't think that's true. Look at car companies, one of North America's most prominent Oligopolies. Ford/GM/Chrystler dominate the market share, yet brand new car companies are able to start up and be successful (Saturn/Kia anyone?)<br>
<br>
You can reward &quot;top&quot; companies, however, you need to make sure they run there companies in a competive and free market system - not as as monopoly. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uarrhenius1.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Arrhenius1</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 146<br> <font color=#E9D756>(3/15/02 9:48:24 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3107.topic&index=92>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Economics for today</span><hr size=1> Bravo, Cenelron!

<br>
I can't speak for the rest of the world, but I live in what I would call the most fair place on earth.  I live in a place where men are free to establish their own goals and pursue them, and the idea that one should be punished for success is beyond reason.  <br>
<br>
I came from very humble roots, some might even say my parents were poor.  My father came to this country with nothing more than the clothes on his back, but he gave me everything, and I don't mean that in a material sort of way.  He showed me by example what initiative, resolve, tenacity, responsibility, accountability and hard work in general were all about.  He never asked for a handout from anyone; he worked for everything he ever had, and though to this day he is not a wealthy man, he achieved his goal of making my life easier than his was.  <br>
<br>
Those traits that he showed me laid the foundation for the success I am achieving today, and they are also the basis of my conservative beliefs.  I'll do all I can to give my children even more opportunity than I had; that's my driving force.  I believe that hard work should be rewarded, not punished or looked down upon, and if that's evil conservatism, then so be it.<br>

<br>
Yes, economics are cyclical, and recessions are inevitable, but market crashes are another thing. Sure they are going to happen, but by observing why we can prevent them from happening or at least minimize thier effects. Reaganomics recreated the &quot;Roaring Twenties&quot;, so why was it a surprise that the market did a repeat of what ended that boom. <br>
<br>
No you never said wealth was the number one factor in determining social value, but with a little observation and by deciphering words like lazy, whiners, when you refer to the lower classes, one can infer that. <br>
<br>
If you make the money you should decide how it gets spent, but after its taxed its government money. It is not theirs anymore. We are the government. We the lazy, whiny masses are the voters so WE should get the majority say. Does your employer or clients, tell you how he wants you spending your check, because he is the one making the money? <br>
<br>
Yeah, I do think Bushes horrible record with minorities is more of an injustice than making the rich pay taxes, that's cause i am lazy and want others to pay for me, or something like that.<br>
Maybe my showing concern for others is another point where I am lacking in character. <br>
<br>
Oh no, I don't believe all conservatives are hate-mongerers. I know of several who can use the words lower class and middle class, instead or lazy-whiners. You can say it however you want to, reimpowering blacks = ending EOE laws, anti-regulation is pro-business, its a strong point of both political parties to never point out the divisiveness of their decisions and try to make it look like they are rubbing elbows with those about to take the shafting. <br>
<br>
Nope like I said I rally behind even those whose ideas I oppose if I believe they are within their rights. <br>
<br>
Thanks andmun, I appreciated those points of yours.  One quick question though, didn't Saturn and Kia benefit from certain laws providing government assistance or tax breaks to companies that produce cars that are environmentally friendly. <br>
<br>
I know what you are talking about with the theories of an infinite economy, but I have also heard a very logical argument against this. It states that their will always be a finite number of workers, consumers, and hence dollars. So, although we will never be able to, with any certainty put a top end cap on the economy it is finite. Infinite implies without end or beginning, and tracking where the trade started is virtually impossible, it is inevitable there is a start somewhere. I know the economy is cyclical and circles are in essence a form of infinity, but the economy is not a perfect circle and it is important that the cycles are watched, so it does not become finite. Yes, we in America are pretty darn safe, but their are numerous cases where a countries unit of exchange becomes devalued to the point of worthlessness. This is what I meant by finite. I in noway meant it was easily limited and apologize if that was the inference. My point being when people put to much stock in the &quot;money is never ending&quot; idea it can cause a devaluation of the dollar. Just the way I have seen it. <br>
<br>
I agree with your assessment of rewarding companies, that was poor wording on my behalf. What I meant to be saying is that by rewarding those who take shortcuts to get to the top, it can easily lead to reduction in market shares for those who didn't take such short cuts. Thus in a competitive market, which I am completely for, it is in our best interest to level taxes on those who present the threat, then offer tax breaks to those who run upto standards. It is a lot easier than the chase them down afterwards way and a lot more realistic than taxing the general populace and trying to determine how much of their income went to companies that fit standards. <br>
<br>
Nisho, evil-conservativism isn't the belief that hard-work is rewardable. I was taught hard work is its own reward, and in my opinion it has been. Evil conservatism is the idea that those who aren't financially well to do are not successful or hard working. I am glad you believe in responsibility and accountability as some of your base values, now as it relates to the first post, do you believe that the public or the corporations are responsible for superfund sites. That is what this argument is about. I am proud of you and your family for coming so far. You lead by example and that is truly good. I do believe in hard work too. I, despite what Cenelron way think, base my existance on this. I also fully expect those at the top to continue working, not just for money, but for improvement. Environmentally friendly companies should be rewarded for the extra-work they do, this comes in the form of the tax breaks I mentioned.<br>

That is the problem.  You believe they should be on the hook for problems they do not create. <br>
They should pay more for what you want government to do because they have more....they<br>
should be on the hook for more.  That is where the base disagreement exists.  You want the<br>
government to forcibly take their money in the form of taxes so that it is then &quot;our&quot; money to do<br>
what &quot;needs&quot; to be done.<br>

How about this, how about a law that says every artist needs to be forced to paint me one picture<br>

art, and you are so rich with artistic ability you can afford to do it because you can do it for free<br>
(or at least for cost).  Everyone should have their life enriched by art and that is the only fair way<br>
to do it since not everyone can afford to buy some.  How do you like that idea for a law?<br>

say that other people should pay their share of taxes since they don’t have as much money are<br>
greedy freeloaders and shows class envy.  You are very bad at inferring and generalizing, you<br>

No, you shouldn’t get the majority say.  This is a Republic, not a Democracy.  Whether it is<br>
politically correct to state it or not, the truth is that our government is specifically designed to put<br>
more educated, responsible and SUCCESSFUL/ACCOMPLISHED/CAPABLE people in control<br>
of the decision making in order to keep “mass” rule from taking place.  If it were a true<br>
democracy then every couple of years 51% of the voters could get together and say that everyone<br>
who has more money than them should have their money confiscated and given to the<br>
51%....kind of where you head where your argument and where some Democrats would already<br>
have us if they could get away with it.  <br>
<br>
<br>
And your “employer or clients telling the you how to spend your check” example is, yet again,<br>
another completely baseless example.  Do you not see what an absolute foolish statement<br>
(although it does reflect typical liberal thinking) that is?  I EARN the money in my check from<br>
my clients or employer.  You do not EARN the money taken by the government and the<br>
government doesn’t EARN the money.  I should have control over the spending of money that I<br>
EARN.  This whole working for your money concept is really just beyond your capacity, isn’t it?  <br>
<br>
And this is a good time to point out your statement:<br>
<br>
“Unfortunately we (the bleeding hearts) can't bring up any issue involving money and the<br>
government without someone trying to pin the blame on welfare. I simply cannot believe people<br>
think that $415 of which less than $50 is probably abused is such a drain on the economy. They<br>
glance right over the $1388 per person that goes to corporations and stare at the $415. That $415<br>
includes school programs and help for the handicapped, the $1388 includes helping McDonald's<br>
promote McNuggets overseas, but does not include the tax credits Exxon gets for cleaning up<br>
their mess in Prince William Sound.”<br>
<br>
<br>
How can the difference here escape you? #1 - the $415 goes to millions of people, not a few<br>
thousand corporations and #2 YOU ARE COMPARING GIVING MONEY AWAY TO<br>
PEOPLE WHO DID NOT EARN IT TO SIMPLY NOT TAKING AWAY AS MUCH OF<br>
SOMEONE ELSE’S MONEY!!!!!  The corporations earn money and pay taxes and are given<br>
REDUCTIONS in the taxes that are forcibly taken away from them. “Corporate welfare” is not<br>
welfare, it is a reduction in corporate raping by taxation.  It is really very simple.<br>

What horrible record on minorities does Bush have?  That he doesn’t believe in giving them<br>
preferential treatment and discriminating against others in favor of them?  But yeah, I can see<br>
how your willingness to point out a perceived flaw in someone you hate anyway because he is<br>
not a liberal is real proof of your true concern of others.  That was sarcasm if you couldn’t tell<br>
from my tone. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Again, you are the only one who has used the words lazy-whiner as near as I can tell, although I<br>
would certainly say that I would and could use those words to describe some people.  And maybe<br>
I did say that earlier, but I can’t find it. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>

I have no clue what you are trying to say in the devaluation paragraph and it appears that you<br>
have no clue either.  It sounds like you are making an argument against limitless printing of<br>
money because it will devalue the money and ruin the economy....&lt;shrug&gt; don’t know where that<br>
is coming from.<br>
<br>
<br>
Heh, good theory, take away the corporations money because they are a threat and then give<br>
some back to them if they prove that they behave how you want them to.....freedom at it’s best. <br>
Thanks, comrade, but I will pass on that type of society.<br>
<br>
<br>
“Hard work is it’s own reward” is a good moral theory but a terrible economic theory.  When will<br>
liberals quit trying to force their morality on everyone else?  Soon as you point out one<br>
conservative who has said that everyone who is not financially well to do are not successful or<br>
hard working then you will get one small bit of credibility.  You obviously have ABSOLUTELY<br>
NO CLUE what conservatives believe because you cannot even read written posts and respond<br>
without imagining slanders and biases.<br>
<br>
<br>
Here’s another chance for you:  The sky outside is blue.<br>
<br>
Will Ritt’s next post say “Those damn conservatives all believe the sky is green and that it is<br>
caused by not murdering enough minorities each day...?”<br>
<br>
Stay tuned....<br>

2. Class envy is an interesting topic.  After thinking about it a bit, I've decided that my problem is not class envy.  I come from a very wealthy background, and I don't recall the money making me any happier than I am now.<br>
3. I do think some professions are underpaid, yes.  "Teacher" comes immediately to mind.  These men and women spend day in and day out trying to expand the minds and opportunities of children for so little pay that many of them are on food stamps.  (Especially those in the public school system.)  Yet they continue to do it.  I think they deserve  more money -- if teaching paid more, we wouldn't have the dearth of teachers we do now.  Overworked and underpaid, but I guess there must be some reason they do it....<br>

<br>
Underpaid is a relative term. If you believe they are underpaid in an &quot;economic&quot; sense, then that wouldn't be the case. In the most extreme economics, no one is underpaid (and no one is overpaid). Supply of labour will equal the demand for labour. <br>
<br>
Look at the amount of people applying for teachers college. It's mind boggling. That's why teachers salaries are so low.<br>
<br>
Why are lawyers salaries so high? Because they restrict entry by BAR exams etc, and restrict the entrance of lawyers into the field.<br>

<br>
If everyone has control over every dollar they earn, then there's gonna be a heck of a lot of people who are starving to death. Re-distrubtion of income is a necessaity. And not only does it have economic benefits, it also has cultural, social, and demographic benefits as well.<br>

<br>
Your artist law is a perfect example of your obvious inability to comprehend the tax system. If an artist is in a 50% tax bracket basically he is creating one work for the government the next for himself.  Stephen King talked about this in the beginning of a collection of his short stories. Someone pointed out to him how he was virtually losing money because when he wrote short stories, but he said they were things he felt like doing so he did. The government doesn't tell the CEOs how much they are going to need and then let them decide how they are going to make that much. It taxes them, just as the artist by how much they make. Even these superfund taxes, when you look at them actually, are like that. The governement takes into account several things like income and potential environmental risks.  I never said anyone should pay my share of taxes. Explain to me how the cleanup of  a chemical used in a product that might not even be sold in my country/state/county is rightfully my share that I am trying to dodge. NOW EXPLAIN TO ME IS IT EASIER TO GIVE TAX BREAKS TO ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY COUNTRIES OR ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY INDIVIDUALS. <br>
<br>
I did not say I earned it I said the government earned it and I should have, as this nation was designed, as much say as anyone else who can votein how it is spent.  I don't want to offend you anyfurther by jumping to conclusions you seem loathe to invalidate, so do you believe, as I have heard some foolish people say, that the government does not provide services to you?  Oh wait you did say the government does not earn its money.  Do you truly believe  this? <br>
<br>
Apparently you didn't read my thing on the corporate welfare vs social welfare.  The numbers are how much each person pays in, on average for each service. It isn't how much each recipient averages. Makes the numbers look different huh?  You see I pointed out that the corporate welfare does not include tax breaks, even those like the Prince William Cleanup. In fact you quote that section and then say that corporate welfare IS in my examples, tax cuts. It is very simple if you can understand words in the order they are strong together. <br>
<br>
No, I don't have concern for Bush. I might have given a crap, about him once, but after the governors were calling moratoriums on the death penalty and investigations were placed on death sentences, he shut down the investigations, went out of his way to do so.  Grinned and said I believe they are all guilty that have been found so.  Even as day after day DNA testing was releasing people on death row.  The uppity negroes part was actuall a quote of his in regards to a black lead PAC group. That man should learn to know when cameras are rolling and tape machines are on. Even if reporters are&quot; a$$holes&quot;, or if he feels the need to brag to a foriegn dignitary that &quot;I can't believe I won. I was running against peace, prosperity and incumbency.&quot; he should remember we will quote him on it later.  What is the definition of &quot;is&quot; anyway.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Waaaa....&quot; I perhaps took out of context. Perhaps that was meant to be us liberal's mating call? Or was that an alliterative whine?  <br>
<br>
The devaluation part was addressed to andmun. I was interested in hearing his theories on those theories, because he seemed to have a very real grasp on economics.<br>
<br>
<br>
BTW Zariel...I have read a few of your posts and think you got a good grip on things. Wanna you know waaaaaaa waaaaaaaa waaaaaaaaaa<br>
