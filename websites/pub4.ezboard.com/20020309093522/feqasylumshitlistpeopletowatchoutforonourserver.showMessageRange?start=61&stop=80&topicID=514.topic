That ogre warrior was ok in my alts warroir group in HH keep.  He was 26 level warrior.  Thats who has the lam by the way.  Atleast it looked like one without actually inspecting him.<br>
<br>
But he refused ML looting but agreed when he would get the ears for faction,  but everyone was ok with that.  Since most groups my alts been in there will let the evil races and lizzards have the ears for faction.<br>
<br>
He wasn't all over the corspes when my alt was there.  In fact the corpse tended to sit around for a while till someone got up and looted one, and someone would loot another.  After awhile another 30 level pally joined the group, then noone saw a corpse after that since it was being loot before it hit the ground.  But it wasn't Geebus doing the looting. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    After that started we suggested ML for the first time.<br>
<br>
One more thing.  Geebus did get into a shout match with guard/lo camp about spawns.  But that is usually HH Keep behavior and didn't think much of it. <p><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#FF00FF"><b><I>Tsulyra Shadowhawk</I></b></font><br>

You are a moron. I talked to a GM who also revealed Dandate's Alts. "Wont reveal personal information".. my ass. How the hell is that personal. When the guy is making alts to fuck people faster than the GM's could catch up. They are just recruiting some help. <br>
**In the GM's words..."We have heard from many about this guy. I hate people like this, I really do. They ruin the game for everyone, and If I could catch him or his associates now , their ass would be gone! We will get them, I guarantee it!"**<br>
<br>
 And why the fuck are you up here defending some guy who has ripped tons of people off......? <br>
<br>
I think you should quit while you are ahead you dumb fucker! Your pourpose on earth is to steal MY oxygen!<br>
<br>
<u>And, yes, go check out what EKG does deem worthy of a shit-list posting...in his own thread. What a fucking watse.</u><br>
<br>
Either EKG is:<br>
A) Dandate or and alt<br>
B) A guy who is sucking Dandates dick<br>
C) useless waste of a life, thinking he knows of what he speaks.<br>
D) all of the above<br>

Why dont you post your name so we can have a talk in /tell you pathetic sack of dog shit. Quit w/ your meaningless posts. All you are doing is digging a fucking hole for yourself, defending one of lanys's worst thiefs, and posting a shit-list thread that was pointless at best.<br>
<br>
Want to know my theory?...<br>
Your shit-list post seems like you were looking for something to get this guy w/. Maybe because you are Dandate, and YOU have made such an ass out of yourself. You are pissed at me and anyone w/ my guildtag infuriates your sorry ass. So, you found the first one..in HH of course...where the said Geebus hangs out..YOU. And you looked for something to flame.<br>
<br>
close?<br>
<br>
I hate this game and boards because people are allowed to hide behind a Toon, or a user ID. You, if I ever had a chance to meet you or this Dandate char in RL, I would be able to work this all out very quickly. But I cant...and im am sure you fists prolly hurt right now from beating off all nite looking at gay porn,  and your chess team has a match, and you are singing w/ the girls choir at 1:00, and you finally made it onto a sports team, but you are a bench bitch for the Girls Volleyball team.

Benzor why don't you give your name? I know it is you. You're the only one I have ever had this problem with. And think it is heinous? That's a laugh, all you could talk about was your good friend Geebus and how you were going to be getting stuff from him. How the hell so you think he got that stuff?<br>
That is the reason I brought your name up, you and he are buds, running pals, and YOU condone his actions and talked about even profiting from it.<br>
I am a big enough person to apologize to you if this is wrong, but come here and admit who you are and explain how you can actively defend Geebus, an ALT!<br>
Outside of the fact you have a lousy choice in friends, you have the potential to be a great player of the game, but you are letting misguided loyalties get in your way.<br>

We all agree that it is wrong.<br>
<br>
Second: EKG and Dreamingwolf are both correct. This post is not a witch hunt. It is attempting to uncover the truth so that people can be wary of all the alternates that this person is using.<br>
<br>
I also believe that EKG is correct. His original post was immediately after a post that stated that Benzor was good pals with Geebus. The poster even stated that this person was not that same person as Geebus. How can we condemn someone that &quot;seems&quot; like they are &quot;pals&quot; with another character? EKG is warning us not to use &quot;guilt by association&quot; but rather &quot;guilt by actions&quot; to guide us to the truth. Arthur Miller did the same thing in &quot;The Crucible&quot; and I found the quote quite appropiate. He is NOT comparing the boards to a witch hunt...He IS attempting to warn us that shitlisting a large group of people because they &quot;appear&quot; to be someones friend is unjust. <br>
<br>
Here is an example: I group with person A and we have some common interst..cars, girls, etc. I'm talking to this person for a little while because we have this common interst. To someone that comes into the group, I may seem like I'm good freinds with person A. Now person A is really a loser and he steals items from others, but he has been more than friendly to me. All of a sudden, I'm named on the shitlist because I was being friendly with person A. Doesn't that seem wrong to you? This is exactly the same thing that may have happened to Benzor. His name will now be remembered in conjunction with Geebus when there is NO proof that he has anything to do with this scam.<br>
<br>
Yes, this guys alternates should be tracked down. No, this guys &quot;friends&quot;, unless they are PROVEN to be helping him, should not be named here. I understand that you are all upset, but please use some reason when accusing anyone before they have PROVEN themselves guilty.<br>
