FUK YOU YOU BAPTISTS COKSUCKERS.  Those kind of people piss me off when they claim to be speaking for God or Jesus or Christianity.  Those kind of people ruin it for others and taint Christianity for future people.  Next time I hear someone say some dumbass shit like that I'm gonna tell them, &quot;your god sux cock&quot; cause their god is'nt my god.  I HATED those Baptists FUKS.  I heard that bullshit the whole time I was in that shithole of ignorance.  Then In college in north carolina i had a &quot;religion class&quot; with our teacher who was a Baptist.  That numbnut fuk repeatedly cuttdown catholics(there are none in north carolina) and always bragged about being Baptist(he was a minister) That no-dick coksukin dyke bragged on his religion. WHICH, affrimed the fatc that he was one of those people who believed in his RELIGION and NOT GOD.  THAT is the difference between the fuks and the fukees.  the religious peps who claim all that bullshit are the fuks and the fukees are those who have to be looked at in the same category because they have a relationship with God.

And, I will also stipulate that my drunken posting above used sweaping generalizations that are incorrect. Of course, not all Muslims are going to agree that the Quran commands the killing of Christians. But I have not only read, but talked with many Shiite Muslims who regard Christians as infidels. You certainly cannot deny that early on in Islamic history we find Muslims killing Christians (not out of self defense) in the name of Allah as found within the pages of the Quran. Well, you can deny it, but history will only prove your assertion false.<br><br>Christians act with the same duplicity, &quot;We are peaceful god fearing souls&quot; but they have bloody histories and would not hesitate to kill in the name of their god if given license. You can bet they will be thumbing through their holy book and quoting it in support of their actions, just as many Muslims who support Osama bin Laden's terrorist acts did!<br><br>Muzaak Headbanger <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/usolathanhonorshield.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Solathan Honorshield</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 113<br> <font color=#E9D756>(11/21/01 5:36:27 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=242.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Religious Wars!</span><hr size=1> Hello! here i am again.<br><br>Before we start, I'd like to say something.

In their  set of beliefs, killing a none-shiite muslim would get them to heaven ( as - from what you said - they feel about christians). Juggle that with the fact of islam being a religion of total peace, of social security, of family and individual ( again willing to discuss any point you have <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ), you'll see what 'shiite' is about.<br><br>About the wars.

You appear to be working within a set theological point of view. A viewpoint I will not even attempt to refute, since it is futile.<br><br>Let me just say that while you claim the Shiite are not Muslim, they themselves firmly believe they are and that their interpretation of the Quraan is correct. Who is actually Muslim? I don't really care, truthfully.<br><br>As far as examples of war go historically I can point to the Muslim occupations of North Africa, Spain and parts of Southern Europe between 700 and 1400 CE (AD). At that time Christians either converted to Islam or faced death or were exiled from their home lands. But don't let that atrocity fool you, since Christians were doing the very same thing to Muslims! Of course, there were periods when both Christians and Muslims lived peacefully, too. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  However, to deny that Muslims don't have a bloody history just as Christians do is to ignore the facts. <br><br>Again, I don't want to get into a theological debate with you. I merely state what historically is the case, which is many Muslims have quoted the Quraan in support of killing Christians (Shiite for example). Is their interpretation correct? That is something I will let Muslims fight out.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/usolathanhonorshield.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Solathan Honorshield</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 114<br> <font color=#E9D756>(11/29/01 6:12:19 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=242.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Religious Wars!</span><hr size=1> Sorry for being late again!

Here's what I should've said earlier:<br><br>1) Shiite's are a small minority, 10-15% or less of all Muslims ( mainly Iran, east of Saudi, some in Kuwait, Bahrain, Lebanon and Syria ). What they think ( and how they try to explain Qu'raan) should not be generalized to all Muslims!<br><br>Really, I don't think of any human being as an 'infidel' or hate them or such.

At that time Christians either converted to Islam or faced death or were exiled from their home lands. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br><br>The following is a fact: In Islam, religious freedom for EVERYBODY is totally guaranteed, as said in the following ( from Qu'raan' ):<br><br>{{Let there be no compulsion in religion: Truth stands out clear from Error }}  (Al-Baqarah: 256)<br><br>And this:<br><br>{{ Say, &quot;The Truth is from your Lord&quot;: Let him who will, believe, and let him who will, reject (it)}}  (Al-Kahfi: 29)<br><br><br>And lastly:<br><br>{{ To you be your Way, and to me mine }}  (A-Kafirun: 6)<br> <br>So yeah, no one would ever 'force' any one into becoming a muslim ( while FOLLOWING Islam), since that change of religion would be false. Mind you, i am not saying that it never happened. What I am saying is that those who did it were following their own goals, and should not be ascribed to Islam <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br>The other part of what i wanted to say is about the very early Islamic wars ( most of which were REALLY for Islam and not for personal goals) . Those wars were not like the wars we know, they were truely for liberation and freedom, to bring justice to the obressed ( sp? ) populations of those regions. <br><br>The biggest proof of this is: Most of those populations are STILL mainly Muslims. If you were forced into something, you'd leave it as soon as you possibly could, wouldn't you? If so, why they did not? <br><br>Also, more in support with the ideas I presented earlier is the respectable % of Christians still living in those areas.<br><br>Spain and south europe is another story, which i'll give more of <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  my </i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> viewpoint about if required!<br><br>This is a tiny quote i am too lazy to write ( I.e. I cut and pasted it <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  )<br><br><!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>Anyone who knows the early history of Islam, will know that all those nations and empires which came under the fold of Islam were indeed previously oppressed. When the companions of the Prophet Muhammed (saws) went out for the offensive jihad against the Egyptians, the Persians and the Romans, we find that the people did not resist against them at all. Rather, they accepted Islam on such a scale, that it is inconceivable that the jihad of Islam could be anything other then a liberation for these people; a liberation from centuries of tyranny. In fact, with the Byzantine Egyptians and the people of Spain, the Muslims were even beckoned to come and liberate these lands from the oppression of their kings. <br><br><hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <br><br>Now, let me reinforce what i always say in such threads!

Without the understanding of what sin is, and our relization that we cannot avoid it, we would not have understood what the death of a sinless Jesus who was fully man and fully God would even mean.  So, God did not make any mistake.  He sent the commandents to prepare the world for Jesus, and what his death meant to us.  It was planned.

To be more clear, "Christian" is a term not used often in the Bible.. its more of a human devised label.  Let's assume in this instance that the term "Christian" means someone who follows the Bible and God's plan for His children.  Based upon that the people who carried out the Spanish Inquisitions were not "Christians."  Lets make one more big and false assumption.  Lets assume that the people who killed people who would not confess Christ were Christians (who accepted Christ AND were baptized for remission of sins, as required by the Bible) ... I previously stated that Christians make mistakes and unless you don't you really don't have room to talk.<br><br>BUT, beyond all that... the point I made was that people do not kill for God, no matter what they claim.<br><br>Now, if you can find me a place where God asks his Church to kill on His behalf.... <p><font color=green><b>Cendan Tankenpriest</b></font color><br></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/utriff.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Triff</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.maclem.com/images/triff/triffdot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 530<br> <font color=#E9D756>(12/3/01 5:03:46 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=242.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Religious Wars!</span><hr size=1> He CERTAINLY didn't tell anyone to kill anyone!

The laws of the Old Testament are no longer considered binding for the most part.  It's true that different denominations and different Christians sometimes treat the old laws differently, but the fact is that no respected branch of Christianity today considers it acceptable to kill people in the name of God.  It's true that some Christian cults have been known to do so, as well as some individuals, but holding all Christians responsible for that (or for the Inquisition or Crusades, for that matter) is a lot like holding all Germans responsible for anti-Semitism.  There are Germans who hate Jews, and in the past hatred of Jews was a norm in Germany.  Does that make someone of German descent today responsible for those crimes?  I don't think so.  Some of you guys accusing Christians of bigotry and such need to look in the friggin' mirror.  I'm seeing bigotry all over this thread and this forum, and it's not coming from Christians. <p>Ahry - hero of Gaoth an Iar, Percival server <BR>Arikel Callistrae - retiredmonk of the Erollisi Marr server</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ulurikeen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lurikeen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 60<br> <font color=#E9D756>(12/3/01 9:32:28 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=242.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://server2048.virtualave.net/neplusultra/images/Links/Necromancer_Links/necrobackground.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Religious Wars!</span><hr size=1> [quote]"First, they have never killed people FOR GOD.

I'm talking about modern Christians, what someone may or may not have done a few thousand years ago doesn't necessarily reflect on the actions of modern Christians.  How does the fact that people were killed in the name of Christ in the Middle Ages reflect on the modern Christian?  As far as those of us outside that religion are concerned, it doesn't.

You painted all non-christians posting in this thread as "bigots".<br><br>Also, I am not personally attacking you or Cendan and I think you are reading hostility where there is none. :) Indeed, what I stated early was that Cendan is in denial about the history of Christianity or he knows nothing about it. I fail to see that as a personal attack. Cendan, if your feelings got hurt accept my apology.<br><br>I did answer your questions Arikel. Further, in answer to your questions regarding painting all Christians with the same historical brush that just was not done. Again the original premise was that Christians and Muslims (not all of them!) have used their holy books to defend killing in the name of god. I am not "holding" anyone responsible for the history of Christianity, Islam, or Judaism. The scathing remarks are concerning those who would use the name of their god to murder. And, if you want an example of modern Christians invoking the name of god to help them kill just listen to them pray for god's help in killing the Taliban. I heard GW Bush pray such a prayer on national television.<br><br>Let me repeat so you are not confused any longer...<br><br>I am NOT accusing ALL Christians or Muslims of killing in the name of their god; neither am I holding them ALL responsible. However, I will press the point that people in ALL monotheistic religions commited atrocities in their histories and some continue to do so to this day.
