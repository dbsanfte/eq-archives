However, I think you should ponder the idea of &quot;your greatest sttrength is also your greatest weakness&quot;  because your responses to the topics at hand always critique others.  In fact I think its fair to use, Criticism.  You are just as ignorant as the fanatical realigious freaks in this world by taking the stance to reject and ignore others thoughts.  LOL, you have exemplified that you are just as much a &quot;Black and White&quot; thinker as the ones you criticise.  You fukin Arrogantly-ignorant fool.  You remind me of, &quot;The fool who trips over his own silver tongue&quot;.  Why don't you share your ideas, beliefs and feelings of the topic?   You are so fukin smart right?  Enlighten us on your perfection.  Oh, wait.  Your not up to the challenge;  you will only get defensive cause of all the people in the world who claimed to be of God which you now despise and as a result despise the thought of getting to know God.

It is OK to go through your delusional episodes. I recommend that you do not quit taking your medications. With a combonation of drugs and psychiatric care you can return to a normal fruitful life.<br>

<br>
I haven't even read this post since I bumped it, seriously thinking no one would visit the website and check out the teachings.  And maybe no one did.  Who knows.  I would be interested to know if Muzaak actually did visit the site and listen to all the teachings in their entirety.<br>
<br>
However, since my name has been mentioned and used in arguments here in this post, who don't I clear a few things up.<br>
<br>
First off, Muzaak, I am female.  You kept calling me a he and of course as we have never met in RL, there is no way for anyone to know that unless I say.<br>
<br>
Secondly, my intention in posting this link was to provide some teachings that were being done by a leader at my church on the bombings.  As I listened to him teach, I found a lot of what he said very interesting and thought I would share the link.  That is all.<br>
<br>
Third: In the past, I have spoken of evangelism etc. but in this post I did not at all.  It is however mentioned at the end of all of our teachings, so if that is where you heard it, then I can see where you might get the idea I was evangelizing here.  However, in this case, I actually was not purposely doing so.  Of course, if someone heard the message and accepted Christ as a result of the teaching or other items they saw on the website, more power to them!<br>
<br>
Fourth:  I am not exactly sure where you got the idea I was promoting my chuch.  If that were my sole purpose, that would be a very silly thing to do as my church may not be anywhere near anyone who even reads these boards.  Also, I am not in the habit of promoting my chuch, and did not do so on this post.  Instead, I was promoting the teaching itself.  I found the information interesting, and if you read my intital post again, you'll see that I even mention that whether people agree with it or not, it is thought provoking.<br>
<br>
Fifth:  I am not sure where Misty's remarks came from or why they were directed to me when I had not posted anything other than the original post.  <br>
<br>
Sixth:  (In general) I am not exactly sure Muzaak why you do so love to attempt to flame me, and make it seem as if everything I might say is a lie.  I have stated in other posts, that I realize you are an atheist, who does not believe what I believe.  I have politely said on several occassions, that I do respect your opinions even though I do not agree with them.  If your intent is to try to stop me &quot;converting&quot; peple as you (or someone) put it, perhaps you should realize it is NOT my intent to convert anyone.  All I ever do, in any post on this matter EXCEPT THIS POST (where I did NOT evangelize at all -YET), is to let people know there is a perfect, loving God who is Holy and righteous and that He sent his son to die for all mankind, in order to reconcile us to Him so that we may have eternal life.  I am not telling you what to think.  I am presenting another side to the story.  I always state that it is a PERSONAL CHOICE whether to accept Christ or not.  Of course I do hope people do this, and yes that includes you (Ok I feel the flame coming on from that one), because God did this for ALL of us.  But it is a choice, and you can choose to reject God.  As you have done.  That your choice.  No, it isn't mine, and I mourn your choice, because I do believe that choice does have an eternal consequence.<br>
<br>
Ok now I've done it.. darn it I evangelized in this post.  I take it back where I said I didn't cause NOW i have.  However in my original post I did not.<br>
<br>
I am sure you can see the difference.<br>
<br>
Now, to close.  <br>
<br>
I am positive some people went and looked at this site.  At least I hope they did.  And I want you to know personally Muzaak that I did not do this out of some malicious intent to take advantage of people.  A lot of people were asking where was God during this.  My chuch leader was answering that question.  Was he the only one doing so? No!  In fact some Christian went on TV (cannot remember the name but I can look it up if you want ) and said it was God's judgement for abortiona dn stuff.  Thats utter nonsense in my opinion, but a lot of people probably believe it.<br>
<br>
I simply posted the link as a place to get some answers.  Maybe people agreed, maybe not.<br>
<br>
Hint tho -  it says in the title a church's teachings on the subject so therefore, if someone did not want to hear a Christian view, I am sure they did not visit.  That would be like attending church and then complaining that all people talked about was God all morning.<br>
<br>
As for bible thumping.  Not sure where you got that idea.  I believe I have talked about God in a total of maybe 4 or 5 threads.  In my view a bible thumper is someone who goes around doo to door or maybe those preachers on the college campus who holler about how terrible we are.  <br>
<br>
Now, personally, I realize you don't like me Muzaak, simply because of my religious views.  However, if you have such a distaste for anything I write, my suggestion is not to read it.  No one is forcing you to read it, so skip over it.<br>
<br>
Btw, I thank you for your concern, but I am content with my house, family, friends, faith, in general with my life.  I believe I mentioned that ina  previous thread to you somewhere.  If by &quot;getting a life&quot; you mean a life without God, well, in my perspective, that isnt a life at all, its simply existence, and an empty one at that.<br>
<br>
I know you'll reply to this.  I know you'll flame me, call me stupid and ignorant, point out my typos, probably throw ina  few choice words, and in general pick apart anything I said and try to make it look stupid.  Thats ok.  Go ahead if it makes you happy or if you feel you are truly accomplishing something worthwhile.  However, you know you aren't goign to change my faith, so why bother?  Up to you though.  After all, I replied <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I won't dignify any /rude flames with a response, but if you have a serious question, perhaps I will.  Or email me.  <br>
<br>
Btw, Misty, if you were replying to the actual teaching itself, feel free to email me any questions you had.  I'd be happy to reply.  As I said, I am sure many people would not agree and thats ok.  If you were relying to some posts though, you mixed me up with someone else - I only posted the intital post and now this one.<br>
<br>
And Raed, thanks for trying to defend me somewhat.  I am sorry I didn't look earlier.  However, maybe between the two of you, this thread was kept alive long enough for people to actually see the link and check it out.  Funny to think that maybe God was using Muzaak all along to promote Him <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  .<br>
<br>
Anyways, good luck all.  If this falls into obscurity, np.  I was amazed it made it this long.<br>

A VERY long explanation from Lukaria!<br>
<br>
Quote Lukaria:<br>
<br>
&quot;I would be interested to know if Muzaak actually did visit the site and listen to all the teachings in their entirety.&quot;<br>
<br>
Yes<br>
<br>
Quote Lukaria:<br>
<br>
&quot;Third: In the past, I have spoken of evangelism etc. but in this post I did not at all. It is however mentioned at the end of all of our teachings, so if that is where you heard it, then I can see where you might get the idea I was evangelizing here. However, in this case, I actually was not purposely doing so. Of course, if someone heard the message and accepted Christ as a result of the teaching or other items they saw on the website, more power to them!&quot;<br>
<br>
BS. You are pretty much saying that you knew what some may be getting into but you could careless because you agree. Much like a porn star doesn't care if others (even minors) see the fucking just so long someone does. =)<br>
<br>
Quote Lukaria:<br>
<br>
&quot;Instead, I was promoting the teaching itself.&quot;<br>
<br>
Which includes coming to your church's version of Christ? Right?<br>
<br>
Quote Lukaria:<br>
<br>
&quot;Sixth: (In general) I am not exactly sure Muzaak why you do so love to attempt to flame me, and make it seem as if everything I might say is a lie. &quot;<br>
<br>
Because you are a dumb ass and a liar. Why else? Need another reason cock monkey?<br>
<br>
Quote Lukaria:<br>
<br>
&quot;I am presenting another side to the story. I always state that it is a PERSONAL CHOICE whether to accept Christ or not. Of course I do hope people do this, and yes that includes you (Ok I feel the flame coming on from that one), because God did this for ALL of us. But it is a choice, and you can choose to reject God. As you have done.&quot;<br>
<br>
They do not call them the &quot;Pearly gates&quot; for nothing. I am going to give Jesus the best blow job he has ever had. I am assured an eternal life in heaven when he cums! =)<br>
<br>
Quote Lukaria:<br>
<br>
&quot;I am positive some people went and looked at this site. At least I hope they did. And I want you to know personally Muzaak that I did not do this out of some malicious intent to take advantage of people.&quot;<br>
<br>
Read &quot;Muzaak I could care less about people. I am just trying hard to score points for the Lord!&quot;<br>
<br>
Quote Lukaria:<br>
<br>
&quot;I know you'll reply to this. I know you'll flame me, call me stupid and ignorant, point out my typos, probably throw ina few choice words, and in general pick apart anything I said and try to make it look stupid. Thats ok. Go ahead if it makes you happy or if you feel you are truly accomplishing something worthwhile.&quot;<br>
<br>
Yep, I feal pretty damn good right about now! Nope, not gona call you stupid or ignorant, or even point out your typos. I am just gonna call you a liar and a cock monkey. OK?<br>
<br>
Quote Lukaria:<br>
<br>
&quot;Funny to think that maybe God was using Muzaak all along to promote Him &quot;<br>
<br>
Yup, I knew you or Raedwulf (some dumb ass) would have to come up with such bull shit. Funnier yet is that maybe, just maybe you are right. In which case your church should hire me to fill it up with people. Hell, I'll take the money. I know your preacher is. Shit, he is even fucking the lolitas in your congregation.

However, I will reply to this one because it tells me you really do not understand what you are talking about.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Read &quot;Muzaak I could care less about people. I am just trying hard to score points for the Lord!&quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
If you actually understood the gospel and the essential truths to what being a Christian is, you would know there is no need to &quot;score points&quot; with the Lord.  <br>
<br>
We are saved by way of God's grace, feely given.  You must choose to accept that grace to be saved though.  <br>
<br>
There are no points, there is so &quot;sliding scale, there is no relativism - God's grace is not based upon works.  <br>
<br>
Until you understand that, then you don't really know what it means to be a Christian.  <br>
<br>
I suggest before you debate something, you actually get the facts straight first.  <br>
<br>
Good day.  Do yourself a favor, don't reply to me anymore.  It wastes your time and mine.<br>

I could care fucking less what it means to be a &quot;Christian&quot; because I have no desire at all to be a cock sucking shit brick. Most &quot;good&quot; Christians that I know haven't any grey matter in the skull they think god gave them. It is obvious to me, Lukaria, that you are a dumb shit also. I can't help you and neither would I try. Just in case you haven't figured it out numb nuts, I am an ATHEIST! I don't believe in your god and anything I say about your god or your religion is all in fun from my perspective. For example, when Christ cums it is only because Jimmy Swagart gave Christ the blow job he was looking for! =)<br>
<br>
Lukaria, you are a dumb shit. Let me add Raedewulf, too. I really look forward to the next set of flame bait you two lay out for me. Oh, I know, you two dum fucks will just say, &quot;Muzaak don't respond you are wasting our time&quot;. Interesting enough you Jesus boys keep responding!

Mistyglen is not a chick name, I am a he not a she... <br>
<br>
I took this name from a combination of images which were my preferred approximation of an blend of neo-Arthurian and Tolkienesque "Elvis". Hence my full name is "Mistyglen Ironbright". I desired some antiphony between "Excalibur" and a magical mystery allegorical to being in a Tolkienesque world. <br>
<br>
Allow me to digress.<br>
<br>
I see "The Pelopennesian War", by Thucydides, "The Histories", by Herodotus, Homer's "The Illiad" and "Oddyssey", the legend of King Arthur and Knights of The Round Table (authorship uncertain), the Holy Bible (as text) and the 2 great wars of the 20th century as influencing J.R.R., in works which I have read of his: "The Silmarillion", "The Lord of the Rings" and "The Hobbit". <br>
<br>
The most dramatic moment in LoTR for me is probably when Gandalf (now back from the dead) prepares to face the Ringwraith King at the City gates, in total darkness (which has engulfed the world for days) and a Cock crows...<br>
<br>
<br>
============================================================<br>
<br>
"Then the Black Captain rose in his stirrups and cried aloud in a dreadful voice, speaking in some forgotten tongue words of power and terror to rend both heart and stone.<br>
Thrice he cried. Thrice the great ram boomed. And suddenly upon the last stroke the Gate of Gondor broke. As if stricken by some blasting spell it burst asunder: there was a flash of searing lightning, and the doors tumbled in riven fragments to the ground.<br>
In rode the Lord of the Nazgul. A great black shape against the fires beyond he loomed up, grown to a vast menace of despair. In rode the Lord of the Nazgul, under the archway that no enemy ever yet had passed, and all fled before his face.<br>
All save one. There waiting, silent and still in the space before the Gate, sat Gandalf upon Shadowfax: Shadowfax who alone among the free horses of the earth endured the terror, unmoving, steadfast as a graven image in Rath Dinen.<br>
<br>
"You cannot enter here," said Gandalf, and the huge shadow halted. "Go back to the abyss prepared for you! Go back! Fall into the nothingness that awaits you and your master. Go!"<br>
The Black Rider flung back his hood, and behold! he had a kingly crown; and yet upon no head visible was it set. The red fires shone between it and the mantled shoulders vast and dark. From a mouth unseen there came a deadly laughter.<br>
"Old fool!" he said. "Old fool! this is my hour. Do you not know Death when you see it? Die now and curse in vain!" And with that he lifted high his sword and flames ran down the blade.<br>
Gandalf did not move. And in that very moment, away behind in some courtyard of the City, a cock crowed. Shrill and clear he crowed, recking nothing of wizardry or war, welcoming only the morning that in the sky far above the shadows of death was coming with the dawn."<br>
============================================================<br>
<br>
<br>
Great stuff!<br>
<br>
He (Tolkien)even says he intended to create a myth along the lines of epic narrative, in the foreword to "The Silmarillion", which btw is a beautiful work of literature and is hard to put down even the 2nd or 3rd time it is read...<br>
<br>
*From a Letter by J.R.R.Tolkien to Milton Waldman, 1951 [extract]:<br>
<br>
"But an equally basic passion of mine 'ab initio' was for myth (not allegory!) and for fairy-story, and above all for heroic legend on the brink of fairy-tale and history...<br>
<br>
But once upon a time (my crest has long since fallen) I had a mind to make a body of more or less connected legend, ranging from the large and cosmogonic, to the level of romantic fairy-story..."<br>

I never meant to add appeal to the contents inside this thread. Which I guess an excerpt from Tolkien might accomplish unintentionally. As for Lukaria, as she posted the topic I suppose it might owe more to reflex than motive, I was raised by nuns and brothers hence I am not religious. <br>
Raedwulff simply talks shit, his cohorts talk shit, one questions whether they serve religion or does religion serve them...<br>
