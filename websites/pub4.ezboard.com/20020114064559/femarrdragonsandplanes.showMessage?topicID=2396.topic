I am only posting this because I think there was an injustice done on Fridays Plane of Growth raid.  Initially many of us could not log on due to server problems.  Once we got on, we all gathered at the Port up tree.  After porting up and fighting for an hour or so Darmu showed up. <br>
     <br>
As we moved along the wall there were several armor drops including: cleric boots ( Quis's cleric), shammy boots (shammy, don't remember the name), warrior bracer (Skurvy).  I dont know the details about what happened with Skurvy, but when he won the bracer Darmu became upset.  <br>
   <br>
  After Skurvy was TLed out we moved on along the wall.  We had 7 or 8 adds on one pull which resulted in aa wipe out.  Thankfully there was a cleric from Affliction along that had a click stick.  Since the cleric with the click stick was there CR was done in about 10 minutes.  <br>
  <br>
   Not everyone had died during the wipe out.  There was an SK who was FD up there.  He reported to our group that another warrior bracer had dropped.  I do not know exactly how it worked, but Darmu was the first, or one of the first warriors rezed.  Instead of doing a random and rezing the winner first, Darmu looted the bracer.  <br>
  <br>
  I do not want to sound un-apreciative to Darmu and Quis and the others that run these pick up raids.  I greatly apreciate the opportunity they offer for those of us not in guilds capable of doing these sorts of raids.  I am very glad to have experienced raid leaders that know what to do in the situations that you encounter on Plane raids.  <br>
<br>
Darmu being one of these raid leaders, has been to PoG countless times.  Darmu has several peices of the PoG warrior armor, including the BP.  Most of, if not all the other warriors on this raid had none.  Just because Darmu is one of the raid leaders, does not give him the right to loot something like that.  I know there are no specific rules for a wipe out situation such as this, but with the click stick it would not have been hard to rez the winner of the random, had there been a random.  <br>
   <br>
  I do not have any of the warrior armor from PoG.  I am not posting this because I did not get the bracer, I am posting this because Darmu aquired it unfairly without making any effort to do a random so that the other warriors had a fair chance at getting the bracer.  I know he did not do a random because the SK who was FD up there told me so.  He was rezed and looted the bracer without any efforts to give any of the other warriors a chance at the bracer.  In effect, he ninja looted the bracer.  The other warriors had no chance at winning the bracer, that is in effect, ninja looting.  <br>
   <br>
  I have only been on a couple of the raids lead by Darmu, Quis, Vec ...  I have had nothing but good experiences on these raids until last night. I do not know if this is a common occurance, but if Darmu always exhibits the attitudes and behavior that he did last night, I want nothing to do with any raids that he is on.<br>
   <br>
  Again, I do not like posting these sort of messages, but what happened was wrong.  <br>

&quot;Instead of doing a random and rezing the winner first, Darmu looted the bracer.&quot;<br>
<br>
I was told to loot the bracer.<br>
<br>
there was no time to random, they rezzed me first, PoGs were already on their way, what were we gonna do.<br>
<br>
also, i only have one piece of PoG armor, the BP...after 20+ raids. also...<br>
<br>
&quot;but if Darmu always exhibits the attitudes and behavior that he did last night, I want nothing to do with any raids that he is on.&quot;<br>
<br>
first off...various things happened last night, IE some silly necro that was there, was complaining, whining, blah blah, then continued to stay there. i told him he could leave at anytime, he chose not to. <br>
<br>
I hereby mark last nights raid as gay, and i hereby state that this will never happen again.<br>
<br>
&quot;In effect, he ninja looted the bracer. The other warriors had no chance at winning the bracer, that is in effect, ninja looting.&quot;<br>

You admitted twice you were unaware of the complete details so why did you even post this flame? Come back when you know the full story and quit being a crybaby<br>

What a meant was, I dont know if he was rezed first cause he is darmu, or if he was rezed so he could loot the bracer or what.... thats the only thing i dont know.  But i was told by the FD monk that he was rezed and looted the bracer.  That was all he did, the Protectors of Growth did not show at camp till after nearly everyone was rezed, thats more than enough time to random and loot properly.  And Darmu, if that necro and the cleric with the click stick hadnt come together, there would have been no raid.  We did not have enough clerics at the beginning.  So dont get pissed at the necro.  <br>
<br>
As for Skurvy, i do not know the full details there.  I think that he was initially put in a group, but then he ported up and got himself killed.  but i dont remember for sure.  But Skurvy wasnt the point of my post, i really dont care what happened with him.  My post was about the second bracer.  I only mentioned the first one because that was what seemed to have set your mood for the evening.  After that you were making remarks about peoples intelligence for the rest of the raid.  <br>
<br>
Maybe I am wrong, I admit I have little raiding experience, but i am not a total idiot.  I have learned the game quickly and have put in many hours playing.  But if the whole raid was able to be rezed before the PoGs made it to camp, there was enough time for a random and quick click stick rez......<br>
<br>
So you have one piece of armor, but its the BP, its not like the bracer was that important for you.  With how fast they were rezing, there was no need to loot it right away.  Dont these mobs bodies last like 20 or 30 minutes?? we were only dead for like 10 at most. <br>
<br>
But then I am inexperienced with these things, so if a bunch of you with 20+ raids tell me that the body was gonna rot in less than 15 minutes, i will retract my claims.  Until then... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/unirecnadthetrademaster.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Nirecnad the Trademaster</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 1504<br> <font color=#E9D756>(9/15/01 6:54:23 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://members.theglobe.com/brethrena/hehe.jpg http://members.theglobe.com/brethrena/hehe.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: PoG 9/14 the second warrior bracer...</span><hr size=1> Run your own raids and stop whinning about some pixels you didn't get to make yourself uber. <p> <IMG SRC=http://nirecnad.bizland.com/nire.gif></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uskurvythewarlord.showPublicProfile?language=EN>skurvy the warlord</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 7<br> <font color=#E9D756>(9/15/01 7:48:46 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www2.tsixroads.com/~MHedges/Simpsons/sim23.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: PoG 9/14 the second warrior bracer...</span><hr size=1> actually i was invited...auraier said the following to me &quot;you will find a group on the inside&quot; i qote him exactally he can deny it all he watns but as god as my witness those were the words out of his mouth... <p>Skurvy Hylar<br>

once again, the corpse had 40 seconds left before it rotted. is that more than enough time to run a random?<br>

<br>
2 things to remeber here:<br>
1. Always bring 8 MOB's to camp as long as you know one of them has some Phat Lewt.<br>
2. Always Flame the Raid Leader after raid<br>
<br>
Cause thats exactly what happens like once a week here ive noticed <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/urecant.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Recant</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 50<br> <font color=#E9D756>(9/15/01 10:55:56 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: PoG 9/14 the second warrior bracer...</span><hr size=1> BTW..<br>

<br>
tell me, do you expect to get exp still on raids ?<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
darmu did exactly what anyone would have done in that situation. rather loot it than let it rot? totally!<br>
<br>
dead mobs are a tricky sort, i have seen keal mobs poof within 10 mins  on occasion in the areana. after a wipeout especially isnt a good time to be figuring out whos in or out on a armor drop<br>
