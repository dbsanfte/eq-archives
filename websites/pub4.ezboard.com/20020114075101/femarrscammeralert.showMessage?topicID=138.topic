Well, the truth is i was playing my friend, soulbash's account. I needed a break from warrior and he needed a break from mage, so we kinda swaped chars for a lil, i gave smashur some shitty gear and i twinked the hell out of soulbash (heart of zlandicar, WDSC, etc etc) While working on his epic in kaesora i died and was too tired to loot corpse, so i logged at the OS portal. The next day when i tried to get on the password was changed and I couldn't get on, i figured something came up and he would tell me via e-mail or IG on smashur. A week went by, i franticly e-mailed soulbash to get the password changed, and i asked what happened, but i got no responce. But when a friend of mine went by where the corpse should have been a day before it would have rotted and there was nothing there i started to think that soul ganked me, but i figured i was prolly wrong cause i was on EQ for a lil while before i logged without looting the corpse, and i figured that that online time + the offline time was just enough for it to rot. 1-2 days after the corpse &quot;rotted&quot; soul shows up and tells me he had billing problems and went on vacation. I asked him why he didn't tell me he was leaving and he made up some excuse. I decided i was just paranoid about this and why would it even enter my mind that soulbash would gank me. But it kept getting worse, next time i saw soul he had like all the items he had before i lost everything (minus the heart and cloak), and the exact same planar armor. His excuse was some friends gave him the stuff, but his gear now was better then it was before we swiched chars by like 10x. By now i'm getting very angry at him, and whenever i start to bring things up he always would log or something. A month goes by, with the help of Iaminea (crysten) ruler, greell, xerxese, gabborn, and countless other people i'm back to some nice gear, and i forget the whole thing, that is until my RL good friend calls me and tells me that soulbash was auctioning CoF, IGS, heiro cloak, WDSC, etc, etc, etc. So i send him a tell about it, he first tells me hes auctioning it for an EQ friend, but he cant tell me his name. I told him that was very unbelieveable, so he changes his story, he said he didn't have the stuff, and he was just bored. How was i supposed to believe that? So i get my friend to make him a nice offer on the CoF, and he agreed, and put the cof in the trade bar. I explained to soul that that was my friend and i know he is lying now. So he goes on about telling me that he had another char who won it in a random (he has no char over 30 on his account but soulbash). Right about now i'm VERY pissed off cause i'm thinking of the stuff i could have had if i wasn't ganked (CoF, etc etc etc). But just then everything came together, do u guys remember bambambambam? He had cof, cobalt and other stuff, and came from nowhere. Well, i thought about it and sent him a tell about bambambambam which he denied. But then another thing clicked, iaminea PLed bambambambam in return for an RFS, so i sent iaminea a tell asking if he sent bam a tell or bam sent him a tell (soul and iaminea were friends too). Iaminea told me he sent him a tell out of the blue WHILE he was anon, so he must have known him. So i start trying to manipulate soul's mind trying to get him to admit it (i know i cant get the stuff back but i wanted to know the truth for personal gains) he kept denying it so i told him that ogmuk made me EZ op for the item bazaar and his IP matched soulbash's, and tell instantly if he was lying or not about the corpse he would have to tell me the truth about bambambambam, and he said he was. By now he was basicly telling me it doesn't matter now if he stole the stuff or not, that he could make a new char and i would never know. And eventuly ignored me and left.<br>
<br>
I have been following his chars around a lil and i have found out that he has another char named brakke or brakee, (i forgot which)<br>
<br>
He is the scum of the world and he played with my trust, and i hope u guys remeber this if u ever see him.<br>

I tried looking for you last night but you were not on.<br>
<br>
I'd like to talk to you further about what happened, as I am the guildleader of the guild that soulbash currently finds himself in.<br>
<br>
I'm usually on Charisa these days, but if not, you can ask anyone in Fellowship of Honour if they know who I am on.<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>
<br>
