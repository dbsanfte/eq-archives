The best bit? Magister having to admit that:<br>
<br>
(a) They're incapable of getting to him first, pre-patch. That's one legitimate way into the rotation.<br>
<br>
(b) There's a second way in: one of the guilds <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> in</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> rotation lets you have a shot. There must be eight or more guilds in rotation. Not one of them was willing to let Magister in, thus causing you to spin on your ass for two months trying to get a shot at VS.<br>
<br>
Ever wonder why? It's because all the other guilds in rotation are sick of Magister's attitude. I'm sure if MS wanted back in (they gave up their slot, I believe) they'd be given a kill almost instantly. What goes around, comes around, at least in part. <p><B>Alascariel Etien</B><BR>

As the original post in this thread was directed at the guild specifically it does little good to reply as to anyone's personal views or policies. As Arnwulf seems to be the most reasonable and willing member of Magister to reply, it seems to be taken as gospel that his views represent the guilds in this pissing match. If, and that is a BIG if, that is true than it is clear we can make some assumptions and then should just deal with them. Arn says Magister tries to operate in areas  where they wont run into other guilds/groups. He says he doesnt care to please anyone but himself. I think we can assume that his game play can be classified as anti social by these examples. This is not a perjurative term. It merely describes his game play. If this is the ruling principle of the guild than that is very different from another guild who will go unnamed but was disbanded by Verant. If we go by Arnwulf's statements then it is NOT the view or policy of Magister that they are entitled to have their fun at the expense of others fun. It is just a high probability that their anti social behavior will at times come in conflict with  the behavior of those guilds that behave in a more social manner such as maintaining cross guild lists and schedules. Unless Magister behaves in a manner contrary to Verants rules, then complaining about every petty event is like complaining that guards in newbie zones steal your kill. Get over it. They are what they are. There has to be a place for all those people whose report cards said &quot;doesnt play well with others&quot;. They have just taken it to a group level. Deal with it. How pathetic is it that we see here so many of the servers most signifigant groups and individuals whining. Yes WHINING. You know darn well that you are not trying to accomplish anything. You know darn well you arent trying to change anything. If all caps equates to shouting, perhaps we should all use italics for our rants to indicate whining. As I understand it from the rules of &quot;THE LIST&quot;, Magister cost some group three days. Think about the waste of time and energy that has gone into this thread over that loss of three days. <br>
As for all the &quot;cool&quot; talk about who is uber, I suggest we agree on a new definition. A truly &quot;uber&quot; guild will never allow its members to post any rants, or replies to rants, on a public board. If Magister or MS or even the old DK were truly &quot;uber&quot;, they would not need to reply to whines, defend themselves from attacks or lower themselves to the level of whiny ranters. THAT is my definition of Uber <p>Merentha,

Hi! I am dick sucker and I play eq. I have a screwdriver wedged so far up my ass I spit out nuts for breakfast. <br>
<br>
Gilg, your captain fuckin obvious, you stated what so many people know. Magister = loot slobbing sluts. <br>
<br>
Hi! lets place a raid calender and be anal andy about rules and shit so we can kill mob x on day y and get cool shit. Just look at &quot;magister&quot; now. Its a bunch of fucking toolboxes for the most part who want cool shit not friends or anything. Argue all you want but when it comes down to it its the fucking truth. In fact save your fucking breath/typing cus frankly I don't give a shit.<br>
<br>
Oh wait! I know I know, the folks are really cool thats why you sign anyone up with half a brain who can piss their day away getiing you all cool shit.<br>
<br>
If you want to go on these boards acting like you are the shit you have issues. Does your bitch ass gay lover kick your candy ass that much that you have no self pride so you resort to a video game where no one can see you and you can create a false image of yourself.<br>
<br>
Hi! I like talking shit and hiding behind a computer screen. I just blew a load when I saw how &quot;uber&quot; my pixels were on my character!<br>
<br>
Oh and another thing... Arnwolf go suck on a fatty. You try and be all political to be nice etc... but your just an ass ramming bitch like all your cum guzzling guildmates. <br>
<br>
Dracon... your just a piece of shit who doesn't give a fuck about other peoples feelings. So is your butt fucking friend mahlerion. Lets not bring up why LoV started to fall apart shall we you pathetic fuck.<br>
<br>
Oh and I don't even like united cocksuckers of eq (ui for the dumbshits) but ya know what they play the game because of the people which in turn is why they have fun. I respect that and it is the #1 reason why I play eq. Sure &quot;phat lewt&quot; is cool but it doesnt make the world go round. Go tell your boss at work you got a swiftblade of zek arnwolf and if we are all lucky he will nut on your face. <br>
<br>
You think magister is so skilled because you kill shit first? Are so fucking blind that people just don't give a flying fuck? I could give a rats ass if we kill mob z first, it matters not. <br>
<br>
The reason is thats all they care about where as no one else gives 2 shit's because they realize there is more then eq then having a fuckin scheudle like EQ is your bitch.<br>
<br>
Oh and chuk, your posts are getting fucking lame....Wait I know your bored at work which is very understandable as I am sure many can vouch for (myself included) but I think you might get better satisfaction by sticking the mop up your local janitors ass then posting here very 15 minutes. <br>
<br>
Flame away dicklickers and amuse me. It would be better to save yourself a few minutes of typing but you need to defend your video game pride so you will post anyway.<br>
<br>
And if you just want to call me a hypocrit go right ahead while you repeatedly shove your thumb up your ass. <br>
<br>
Rimmuk, The intoxicated ogre<br>
<br>
PS: For any of you spelling nazi's that what to pick apart my english etc... eat shit and knock your socks off.<br>
<br>
PPS: if anyone in any of the above guilds that I know gets all offended eat my shit. Plenty of people have similar feelings that I do but don't have the balls to spit it out so they can keep good relations etc... Have a nice day fudge packers.&quot;<br>

Sure mistakes happen and people loose out on something but you know in a game with 1000s of people it is impossible for everyone to be happy all the time.  The best solution is for everyone to be flexible and forgiving.<br>
<br>
I would love it if everquest could be all organized and friendly.  A true rotation of VS and Ragefire and others like them would be great.  Like a web page that just keeps track who is next and everyone can be added to the list.  Not by guild but by individual.  I know i hated sitting in Solb for 58 hours just cause that is the only way to ensure that you can get the cleric epic.  (I do like that people are starting to respect at least that camping strategy)<br>
<br>
Sadly the plain fact is this game isnt all lovey dovey and people place their own self interests above others needs.  Everyone does it.  EVERYONE.  So let it go.  Shake it off.  Most people try to be nice most of the time, assume the best about others.  It will make you happier in the long run.<br>

<br>
most people may do this most of the time, or a few people now and again, but its not fair to those truly selfless people out there (and there are many of them), who dont do this at all.<br>
<br>
Look for the good in people, quite often you can find it.<br>

<br>
<br>
Darmu's Definition of Uber<br>
<br>
Uberness is an attitude. an attitude of being better than ANYONE, or ANYTHING. being able to say &quot;Yeh, we cleared so and so dungeon in so and so amount of time&quot; and simply doing it to say &quot;hey, luk at whut we dun!&quot;, not for the fun, or the excitement of the hunt, kill, camp, or slaying.<br>
<br>
In other words...killing things to look cool...and having the attitude to flaunt it.<br>
<br>
Darmu Grymskol<br>
has only killed nagafen twice, been to fear 1, and hate three times o_O<br>

In fact, I never hear anyone in guild chat say &quot;look at us we are so cool&quot;.  I always hear &quot;lets try this guy, it would be fun to take on a new challenge.&quot;  <br>
<br>
Just remember the people in &quot;Magister&quot; guild are just like you.  Just a group of people trying to have fun.  Fun for us is taking on new challenges and pushing ourselves to tougher and tougher mobs.  Sure its fun but it is also a lot of work, and occationally we take pride in the work we have done.  This does not make us better people than anyone in the game.  In fact, i appriciate people that are able to enjoy the game just kicking back and enjoying the scenery.<br>
<br>
My personal self worth is not caught up in weather or not my char is more powerful or has better gear than the next guy.  I joined magister to learn new things about the game.  Take on new challenges.  Not get in flexing contests with other players.  People play this game a hundred different ways.  Magister has simply chosen one way to play, and we are having fun doing it.  The other 99 ways are just as valid and just a good.<br>
