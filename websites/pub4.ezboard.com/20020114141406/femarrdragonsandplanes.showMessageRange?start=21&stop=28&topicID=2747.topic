<br>
And hey.. you better back up your system files before doing this stuff  I warned ya!!!<br>
<br>
Tweak File<br>
<br>
ALWAYS BACK UP FIRST AND USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!<br>
<br>
1.) What are some autoexec.bat tweaks?<br>
<br>
Get rid of everything. These two files load 16-bit dos drivers which are useless unless you play games in dos, which is very very rare these days. If you do play games in dos, I would still recommend doing this, and copying back your backups when you want to play games (one of many reasons why you should ALWAYS back up any file you modify.)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
2.) What are some config.sys tweaks?<br>
<br>
Get rid of everything!! The only line you need in there is<br>
<br>
Stacks=0,0<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
3.) what are some msdos.sys tweaks?<br>
<br>
Add these lines under the [options] section for a quicker boot time<br>
<br>
AutoScan=0<br>
DoubleBuffer=0<br>
Dblspace=0<br>
Drvspace=0 <br>
DisableLog=1 <br>
Logo=0 <br>
<br>
changing DoubleBuffer=1 if you have a SCSI card.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
4.) How can I use Startup Switches to load windows?<br>
<br>
Windows 98 supports a number of command-line switches you can include with the WIN command to start Windows 98 with various options enabled and disabled for troubleshooting purposes. To start Windows 98 with a command-line switch, first boot the system to the command prompt. To do so, press the F8 key while the system is booting (any time after the PC completes the power-on self test). When the Boot menu appears, select option 6, "Command prompt only," to boot Windows 98 to the command prompt, then enter WIN /D followed by the appropriate switch as described in the following sections. For example, you would enter WIN /D:F to start Windows 98 with 32-bit disk access turned off.<br>
:F. Turns off 32-bit disk access. Using this switch is similar to the setting 32BitDiskAccess=FALSE in the [386Enh] section of SYSTEM.INI. Turning off 32-bit disk access is necessary with drives that are not compatible with Windows 98's 32-bit disk access. <br>
:M. Enables Safe mode and is similar to selecting option 3, "Safe mode," from the Boot menu or pressing F5 during the boot process. <br>
:S. Prevents Windows 98 from using ROM address space between F000:0000 and 1 MB for a break point. This switch is equivalent to the setting SystemROMBreakPoint=FALSE in the [386Enh] section of SYSTEM.INI. <br>
:V. Specifies that the ROM routine will handle interrupts from the hard disk controller, and is equivalent to a setting of VirtualHDIRQ=FALSE in the [386Enh] section of SYSTEM.INI. <br>
:X. Excludes all of the UMA range from Windows 98's use, and is equivalent to the setting EMMExclude=A000-FFFF in the [386Enh] section of SYSTEM.INI. This switch can help you identify memory conflicts in the UMA between devices. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
5.) What are some SYSTEM.INI TWEAKS?<br>
<br>
SYSTEM.INI is a Windows 9x/ME/3.xx INItialization text file and resides in your Windows directory/folder.<br>
First, let's see the Windows .INI files editing rules:<br>
<br>
You can replace "no" with "0", "off" or "false". Similarly, "yes" has the same effect as "1", "on" or "true" (but don't type the quotes). This applies ONLY to <boolean> entries (yes/no, 1/0, on/off, true/false), NOT to numeric (decimal/hex) or string (text) values (i.e. DMABufferSize = 0 - 64 KB), which have different measuring units, ranges or characters (exemplified below).<br>
Windows loads its built-in/default values (shown below) for all .INI settings that are not present.<br>
All Windows .INI lines are case insensitive.<br>
You can comment (remark, disable) any Windows .INI entry (instead of deleting it) by preceding it with a semicolon ( . Example:<br>
; 32BitDiskAccess=ON<br>
Windows .INI file maximum allowed size is 64 KB, which is an annoying limitation. Anything above that is not processed. <br>
You need to restart Windows every time after modifying ANY System.ini settings!<br>
CAUTION: BACKUP your .INI files BEFORE making ANY changes!<br>
If you don't know what these lines do, YOU MUST READ your Windows help files/documents/manuals BEFORE altering ANY configuration files, and BEWARE that if you enter invalid values you may experience data loss and/or unexpected machine lockups !!!<br>
The following are helpful lines to add/modify (using Notepad or Sysedit for editing) under the [386enh] section of your SYSTEM.INI, valid for ALL Windows 9x/ME/3.1x releases if not specified otherwise.<br>
And now that we've cleared it all up, let's have some fun... <br>
<br>
32BitDiskAccess=ON To turn on 32-bit disk access in Windows for maximum performance.<br>
To disable 32-bit access ONLY for troubleshooting purposes (NOT recommended), replace ON with OFF. This is equivalent with starting Windows by running:<br>
WIN /D:F<br>
<br>
COMBoostTime=1 To speed up keyboard buffered operations (decrease character download time) at high speed modem transfers (above 9600 bps), using communications/internet applications. Affects the time (in milliseconds) the Operating System processes a COM port interrupt. Default value is 2. If you notice any loss of keyboard characters while using internet/communications apps, increase it to 4 or higher. Experimenting may be necessary to determine your optimal setting.<br>
<br>
COMxBuffer=1024 To increase the buffer size (in Bytes) for characters sent/received by your communications device (modem) on a specific COM port. Replace x with the COM port number used by your modem. Valid COMx values: 1, 2, 3 and 4. Default Buffer value is 128. High values will decrease modem transfer speed slightly, but might prevent loss of characters at high baud rates (above 9600 bps). Experimenting may be necessary to find your "sweet spot".<br>
NOTE: BEFORE increasing the COMx Buffer value, you need to add a COMxProtocol= line (see setting below):<br>
<br>
COMxProtocol= To specify whether Windows should stop simulating characters in a Virtual Machine (VM) after the VM sends an XOFF character, if a communications/internet application loses characters while performing text transfers at high baud rates (above 9600 bps), on a specific COM port. Replace x with the COM port number used by your modem. Valid COMx values: 1, 2, 3 and 4. Valid values: XOFF (to stop) or blank (to continue). Default is any value other than XOFF. Set this line to blank when performing binary transfers.<br>
<br>
COMIrqSharing=ON Windows/WfWG 3.1x ONLY: To enable COM port IRQ sharing in Win31, ONLY IF using ANY serial I/O communications cards (UART, modem, NIC etc) that support IRQ sharing with other hardware devices in your computer. Default is OFF.<br>
<br>
ConservativeSwapfileUsage=1 Windows 98/98 SE/ME ONLY: To disable the "PageFile_Call_Async_Manager" feature that allows the Memory Manager to asynchronously write out swap file buffers during VFAT idle times. This reverts swap file usage back to Windows 95 style, and forces the use of the computer's physical memory (faster) first, before the use of the slower hard disk virtual memory (swap file). Default is enabled (0). See "CONSERVATIVE SWAP", also in TIPS98.TXT, part of my Win9x/2000/ME/DOS7 ©Tricks + Secrets files [W95-11D.ZIP], for complete details. <br>
<br>
DMABufferSize=64 To increase your 16-bit Direct Memory Access (DMA) channel buffer to maximum size: 64 (in KiloBytes). Affects ALL I/O (Input/Output) DMA operations: sound card FM/wavetable, MIDI playback/recording, disk buffered reads/writes. Default value is 16.<br>
In Windows 9x/ME this can also be done in: Control Panel -> System -> Device Manager tab -> System devices -> Direct memory access controller -> Settings tab -> check Reserve DMA buffer box -> 64 K bytes reserved -> OK -> OK. <br>
<br>
DualDisplay=on Mandatory for compatibility with 3rd party memory managers (QEMM, NetRoom, 386MAX etc), to allow Windows to use the B000-B7FF Upper Memory Area (UMA) on VGA, Super VGA (SVGA) and eXtended VGA (XVGA) monitors, ONLY if NOT using a secondary display adapter/monitor. Default value is off. <br>
<br>
EMMExclude=A000-FFFF To prevent Windows from searching the Upper Memory Area (UMA) for unused memory (RAM) upon startup. Safer if you use any 3rd party memory managers (QEMM, NetRoom, 386MAX etc), or any real MS-DOS mode devices/drivers/TSRs in CONFIG.SYS/AUTOEXEC.BAT. This is equivalent with starting Windows by running:<br>
WIN /D:X <br>
<br>
FileSysChange=off Windows/WfWG 3.1x ONLY: To prevent updating file changes in DOS sessions/boxes, and thus speed up disk operations in DOS sessions and File Manager. Default value is on, which decreases system performance on slower computers. <br>
<br>
HardDiskDMABuffer=32 Windows/WfWG 3.1x ONLY: Memory allocated for the Direct Memory Access (DMA) buffer for disk-buffered reads and writes. Default value is 0. If using SMARTDRV with double-buffering turned on, this setting is determined automatically. <br>
<br>
InitPS2MouseAtExit=off Windows/WfWG 3.1x ONLY: Disables the search for a PS/2 mouse upon Win31 exit, thus saving a few milliseconds. Default value is on. <br>
<br>
IRQ9Global=on Windows/WfWG 3.1x ONLY: Use this setting if your system hangs when reading from floppy drive(s) in Win31. Default value is off. <br>
<br>
KeyBoostTime=0.1 To increase keyboard response (in seconds) to keystrokes with several background Windows programs running. Default value is 0.001 (1 millisecond = 1/1000 of a second). <br>
<br>
LocalLoadHigh=1 To allow maximum conventional (low) DOS memory (RAM) in a DOS session/box. Default value is 0. See "LOCALLOADHIGH", also in MYTIPS95.TXT, part of my Win9x/2000/ME/DOS7 ©Tricks + Secrets files [W95-11D.ZIP] for more details. <br>
<br>
MaxBPs=1024 Windows/WfWG 3.1x ONLY: Maximum size in Bytes for break points used by Windows Virtual Memory Manager (VMM). Windows allocates memory space for break points in 4096 Bytes (4 KB) blocks. Default Win31 value is 200, which is actually rounded up to 370, to fit into the first 4K block. When you increase this number to 400, Windows opens a second 4K block, when raised to 800, a third block is allocated etc. <br>
<br>
MaxPagingFileSize=xxxxxx To define the upper (maximum) limit of the swap file size in KiloBytes (KB). Default is 50% of available free space on target drive. Maximum allowed has to match total available free space on selected hard drive/partition, equivalent to deleting this line. See "FIXED SWAP FILE", also in TIPS95.TXT, part of my Win9x/2000/ME/DOS7 ©Tricks + Secrets files [W95-11D.ZIP], for more details. <br>
<br>
MinPagingFileSize=xxxxxx To define the lower (minimum) limit of the swap file size in KiloBytes (KB). Default is NONE. Minimum allowed is 0 KB, equivalent to deleting this line. See "FIXED SWAP FILE", also in TIPS95.TXT, part of my Win9x/2000/ME/DOS7 ©Tricks + Secrets files [W95-11D.ZIP], for more details. <br>
<br>
MessageBackColor=8 To specify the BSOD (Blue Screen Of Death) background (screen) color. Default is blue (1). See "BLUE (OR ANY OTHER COLOR) SCREEN OF DEATH", also in TIPS95.TXT (part of W95-11D.ZIP), or in MYTIPS31.TXT (part of W31-11D.ZIP), for complete details. <br>
<br>
MessageTextColor=C To specify the BSOD (Blue Screen Of Death) foreground (text) color. Default is bright white (F). See "BLUE (OR ANY OTHER COLOR) SCREEN OF DEATH", also in TIPS95.TXT (part of W95-11D.ZIP), or in MYTIPS31.TXT (part of W31-11D.ZIP), for complete details. <br>
<br>
MinSPs=8 Windows 9x/ME ONLY: To increase the spare stack pages, to prevent possible stack fault situations. Default value is 2. Read the "MINSPS" topic, also in TIPS95.TXT, part of my Win9x/2000/ME/DOS7 ©Tricks + Secrets files [W95-11D.ZIP], for complete details. <br>
<br>
MinTimeSlice=40 To increase the minimum time (in milliseconds) a Virtual Machine (VM) is allowed to run before other VMs can take over. Default value is 20. Smaller values (i.e. 10) make multitasking smoother, but decrease overall system performance. <br>
<br>
PageBuffers=32 To increase the 4K page buffers number for storing asynchronous read/write pages, and thus Windows performance. Works ONLY if using 32-bit disk access AND a permanent swap file. Default value is 4. Maximum allowed is 32. <br>
<br>
PagingDrive=X: To specify the (permanent) swap file fixed disk location (substitute X with target drive/partition letter). Default is C:. See "SWAP FILE - Part 1", "SWAP FILE - Part 2" and "9X/2000/NT/MILLENNIUM/3.XX MULTIBOOT SWAP FILE", also in MYTIPS95.TXT, part of my Win9x/2000/ME/DOS7 ©Tricks + Secrets files [W95-11D.ZIP], for more details. <br>
<br>
PagingFile=X:\PATH\FILENAME.EXT To specify the (permanent) swap file location: fixed disk (substitute X with target drive/partition letter), path (substitute PATH with target directory name) and filename with extension (substitute FILENAME.EXT with WIN386.SWP for Windows 95/98/ME or with 386SPART.PAR for Windows/WfWG 3.1x). Default is C:\WINDOWS\WIN386.SWP for Win9x/ME or C:\386SPART.PAR for Win31. See "SWAP FILE - Part 1", "SWAP FILE - Part 2" and "9X/2000/NT/MILLENNIUM/3.XX MULTIBOOT SWAP FILE", also in MYTIPS95.TXT, part of my Win9x/2000/ME/DOS7 ©Tricks + Secrets files [W95-11D.ZIP], for more details. <br>
<br>
PerVMFiles=60 To increase the number of private file handles (similar to the native MS-DOS mode "FILES=" command in CONFIG.SYS) allocated to each Virtual Machine (VM), needed by DOS programs running in a DOS session. Default value is 30 for Win9x/ME, and 10 for Win/WfWG 3.1x. Maximum allowed is 225. The specified number (0 - 225) is added to the minimum of 30 VMFiles Windows allocates by default to each VM. In this example: 60 + 30 = 90 VMFiles. More info @ MSKB. <br>
<br>
SyncTime=on Windows/WfWG 3.1x ONLY: You MUST enable this line if TrapTimerPorts=off (see setting below), to synchronize Win31's time with the BIOS clock periodically. Default value is off. <br>
<br>
TrapTimerPorts=off Windows/WfWG 3.1x ONLY: Helps time sensitive Win31 programs/games that rely on the computer timer to run more accurate. Default value is on. <br>
<br>
VGAMonoText=off To allow Windows to use the B000-B7FF Upper Memory Area (UMA) if not used by other hardware devices (monochrome video adapters) or graphics (VGA/SVGA) applications. Default value is on. If a hardware device or an upper/extended/expanded memory manager using this memory range is installed, this area is unavailable to Windows. <br>
<br>
WindowUpdateTime=200 To decrease the time (in milliseconds) between display updates for slower non-Windows (DOS based) programs running in a DOS session. Default value is 50. <br>
<br>
<br>
6.) FILE SYSTEM SYNCHRONIZATION<br>
<br>
You might own certain applications that may need the asynchronous buffer commit function enabled in Windows 9x/ME to operate properly. This feature was introduced with the release of Windows/WfWG 3.11, and was enabled there by default, thus speeding disk access. But you can also do this in Windows 9x/ME, and speed up disk intensive applications noticeably.<br>
In asynchronous mode, the Windows 32-bit file system starts immediately the next disk operation without checking if the data from the last operation was written correctly to disk, thus decreasing (by 10% in most cases) the time it takes to perform an I/O (Input/Output) read/write disk function.<br>
Some programs specify if this is recommended or necessary in their documentation, but most don't. <br>
But changing the default might prove unsafe if the hard disk presents surface defects/lost clusters, which errors can be easily corrected by running ScanDisk with the "Thorough (performs Standard test and scans disk surface for errors)" option turned on. Also, some disk intensive applications might not "like" the asynchronous mode, and will "complain" by issuing warning messages, or even "behave" improperly. The worst case is a sudden power surge, when the information stored into the memory cache buffer cannot be written properly back to disk, resulting in data loss.<br>
Therefore you may need to return to the default mode: synchronous buffer commit, which allows the file system to always check the data to be correctly written to disk from the memory buffer.<br>
<br>
Now BACKUP YOUR SYSTEM FILES BEFORE PROCEEDING FURTHER!<br>
Then open Regedit and go to:<br>
<br>
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\FileSystem<br>
<br>
In the right hand pane you should see the "AsyncFileCommit" DWORD (Win95/98) or Binary (WinME) Value.<br>
<br>
Create it if not present: right-click -> select New -> DWORD (Win95/98) or Binary (WinME) Value -> name it "AsyncFileCommit" (no quotes) -> double-click on it -> check the DWORD Decimal box (Win95/98) -> type 1 (for asynchronous mode) or 0 (for synchronous mode), or type in the Binary (WinME) Value box: 01000000 (for asynchronous mode) or 00000000 (for synchronous mode).<br>
<br>
Close Regedit and restart Windows.<br>
From now on watch for any weird error messages generated by your programs while in asynchronous mode. If you DO get any, reset back to synchronous mode (default), as described above.<br>
<br>
This can be also achieved the easy way [but that's no fun ] by running Control Panel -> System -> Performance tab -> File System button -> Troubleshooting tab -> place (asynchronous mode) or remove (synchronous mode) the check mark in the "Disable synchronous buffer commit" box -> restart Windows.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
7.) How do I monitor swap file usage?<br>
<br>
Okay, follow these steps to monitor your swap, and set your own size....<br>
First, make sure Windows is managing your swap (very important!)<br>
Then click Start-Run, then type "Sysmon" (without quotes) in the box (if you don't have it, you'll need to install it from your Win98 CD)<br>
When the window comes up, click edit, add item, and select Swapfile In Use from it (from the Memory Manager section).<br>
Click file, Start Logging, and save the file somewhere (it's a text file)<br>
<br>
Then go about your daily business, running all the apps you usually would do, playing the most intensive games you have, etc. Then when the day is done, check your log and look for the largest size the swap ever got to (with 256 it should be quite small). Then, add about 20-30 to it, and that is the size you should set your swap to.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
8.)How can I make Explorer show 2 screens at once?<br>
<br>
DOUBLE PANE EXPLORER<br>
1.Open any folder (i.e. My Computer).<br>
2.Choose Tools (or view) -> Folder options... from the menu.<br>
3.Move to the File Types tab.<br>
4.Locate the Folder entry. To do this fast, click onto the Listview and type the word "folder" (no quotes).<br>
5.Choose Edit (or Advanced.)<br>
6.Select Explore, and finally...<br>
7.Press Set as default, and leave the dialogs using OK/Close.<br>
<br>
Now whenever you open any sort of folder, may it be a drive/directory, the Control Panel or your Mobile Devices folder, you automatically get the two-paned Explorer view for easier navigation. <br>
<br>
<br>

10.) How can I DELETE OUTLOOK PASSWORD?<br>
<br>
"In case you have forgotten or lost your MS Outlook Express (OE) 4/5 login password, you can remove it by hacking the Registry, to be able to access OE again.<br>
Run Regedit and search (click Edit -> Find...) for this Registry key:<br>
<br>
89c39569-6841-11d2-9f59-0000f8085266<br>
<br>
Then delete its subkey.<br>
Now open OE, and type in a new login password.<br>
Note that the subkey name and the USER ID are the same.<br>
If you know your USER ID, go to this Registry key:<br>
<br>
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Identities<br>
<br>
to find out the OE password key name."<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
11.) How can I DEBUG BIOS PASSWORD?<br>
<br>
"This DOS trick resets (deletes) your motherboard BIOS (CMOS) password, to grant access to your computer and/or BIOS Setup once again, IF you have forgotten or lost it. :)<br>
Exit Windows or reboot to the native MS-DOS mode, using the "Command prompt only" option from the Windows 9x Startup Menu (hold Shift and F5 at the same time while your PC boots).<br>
At the C:\> prompt, type:<br>
<br>
DEBUG<br>
<br>
and hit Enter. You'll see a dash (-) at the DEBUG prompt. Now type:<br>
<br>
o 70 2e<br>
<br>
which will show as -o 70 2e at the DEBUG prompt. Hit Enter. Then type:<br>
<br>
o 71 ff<br>
<br>
and hit Enter. Finally type:<br>
<br>
Q<br>
<br>
and hit Enter one last time, to quit DEBUG, back to the C:\> prompt.<br>
Now you're ready to reboot your PC, and press the appropriate key or key combo (look it up in your motherboard manual if you don't know it) to access your BIOS Setup. You'll notice that the password is gone. :)"<br>
<br>
NOTE: This works only with MS-DOS 6.00 - 6.22 and MS-DOS 7.xx [a.k.a. MS Windows 9x].<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
12.) How can I enable/disable my proxy from the registry<br>
<br>
"Try this if you want to set up a proxy, or are having problems with your current one.<br>
Run Regedit and go to:<br>
<br>
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Config\0001\Software\Microsoft\windows\CurrentVersion\Internet Settings<br>
<br>
First, set "EnableAutodial" to 1 if you use a dialup proxy service. Next, double-click "ProxyEnable" and replace the Decimal value of 0 with 1.<br>
Your proxy is now fully enabled!"<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
13.) What can I do with my DirectX settings?<br>
<br>
If you have installed (and I STRONGLY recommend you do!) the current Microsoft DirectX APIs + Drivers [11 MB, free] on your Windows 9x machine, I have a few Win.ini settings 4 ya that enable some hidden features in DX. MS DirectX 5.0 or higher (current DirectX release is 8.0) is required, and they work on ALL Windows 95 and 98 systems.<br>
Win.ini is a Windows 9x/3.xx initialization file, residing in your Windows folder, and can be edited with Notepad or Sysedit in Windows, or EDIT.COM in DOS. Note that all Win.ini lines are case insensitive.<br>
Here they are [some of them can be enabled/disabled using the DirectX Diagnostic Tool (DxDiag.exe, located in C:\Windows\System) version 8.0, bundled with MS DX8]:<br>
<br>
[Direct3D]<br>
debug=0<br>
[DirectDraw]<br>
debug=0<br>
nohwblt=0<br>
nohwtrans=0<br>
nohwfill=0<br>
<br>
[DirectPlay]<br>
BreakOnAssert=0<br>
debug=0<br>
<br>
[Debug]<br>
DMBAND=0<br>
DMCOMPOS=0<br>
DMIME=0<br>
DMLOADER=0<br>
DMUSIC=0<br>
DMSTYLE=0<br>
DMSYNTH=0<br>
DINPUT=0x00<br>
<br>
Most of these lines are used (if set to 1) for debugging purposes if DirectX (5.0 up to 8.0) seems to cause GPFs, errors, lockups etc, by creating Debug.txt files, which can be sent to Microsoft support (i.e. via e-mail), together with the user's hardware/OS specs, for troubleshooting.<br>
In normal conditions it is recommended to set them all to 0, to allow MAXimum speed with all DirectX 3D apps and games, ONLY IF DX works properly, as it does on my PC: Pentium III 700 on Abit BE6-II mobo, 256 MB PC133 SDRAM and Creative Labs Annihilator Pro NVidia GeForce 2D+3D AGP video card. :)<br>
Most of them are NOT set to 0 by default [surprise! :)] if not present in Win.ini as listed above.<br>
Though to create Debug.txt files, one needs to download the separate DXInfo.exe, DXBug.exe, DXTool.exe and the "forbidden" Directx.cpl tools, as part of the Microsoft DirectX SDK (Software Developers Kit) [120 MB, free].<br>
Grab the DX8 Control Panel here [34 KB].<br>
One disadvantage is that for example DXBug also creates a Dxbug.ini (unencoded, plain text) file, which contains private info about the user: name, company, address etc. [Talk about privacy!]<br>
To my knowledge "BreakOnAssert" can be set to 1 to improve gameplay (game controller response) over the internet/network/LAN in multiplayer environment with 3D intensive games like Quake. I know Quake uses OpenGL for graphics, but all newer Win9x games (including Quake II and Quake III Arena) use the DirectPlay component of DX anyway for joysticks, wheels, throttles etc, for direct access at hardware level.<br>
The only Win9x tweaking tool I know of that handles most of these DX settings is DirectControl [104 KB, freeware].<br>
<br>
BONUS: [;-)]<br>
<br>
<br>
Speaking about Win.ini...<br>
3dfx Banshee 2D+3D video card owners (especially the ones manufactured by Creative Labs) might benefit from adding these lines to Win.ini, to tweak the RGB (Red Green Blue) gamma settings to their heart content, to brighten up the display for all 2D+3D programs, including the Win9x desktop GUI:<br>
[3dfx]<br>
SSTH3_RGAMMA=1.5<br>
SSTH3_BGAMMA=1.5<br>
SSTH3_GGAMMA=1.5<br>
<br>
These are the recommended values for most users, if the screen appears too dark in 3D (Glide 3dfx) games/apps. Minimum - maximum RGB gamma values = 1.0 - 4.0. Each color can be changed individually, but "normal" (color calibrated) screen output is obtained by synchronizing all sliders (R, G and B) at the same level.<br>
<br>
<br>
Add (if not present) a new section to your System.ini, named [Display], and these lines under it (example), to speed up all Win9x screen (re)draws, and enhance video quality and resolution, especially in 32 (24) bit true color (16 million colors) modes:<br>
[Display]<br>
BlockWrite=1<br>
DDC=1<br>
Five6Five=1<br>
DevBmp=0<br>
VAD=1<br>
OutEngine=1<br>
<br>
System.ini is the other "vital" Windows 9x/3.xx initialization file, found also in your Windows folder, and can be also edited using Notepad or Sysedit in Windows, or EDIT.COM in DOS.<br>
Some of these settings are specific only to ATI and/or 3dfx video chipsets, but they can be used on most video accelerator brands to improve graphics performance.<br>
BlockWrite=1 speeds up video to memory writes.<br>
DDC=1 turns on the Display Data Channel on older (2D only) graphics boards.<br>
Five6Five=1 forces the 5-6-5 mode in 16-bit resolution (65k colors), even if it is disabled on some controllers (i.e. older ATI chipsets).<br>
ATI cards are known to work better with DevBmp=0 (turns off DeviceBitmap).<br>
VAD=1 turns on the external VGA feature connector on ATI cards, if hooked to an MPEG, video capture or TV card.<br>
<br>
CAUTION: BACKUP YOUR SYSTEM FIRST!<br>
<br>
If you experience video errors/lockups after adding these lines to your System.ini, disable them by replacing 1 with 0, or just remark them by typing a semicolon (;) in front of them.<br>
Note that ANY System.ini changes require a Windows restart to take effect.<br>
Also, make sure to open Control Panel -> Display applet -> Settings tab -> Advanced button -> Performance tab -> drag the "Hardware acceleration" slider all the way to the right (to Full) -> click OK/Apply -> finally reboot, to take advantage of all these video settings. But in the rare cases your video controller freezes up on the "Full" position, drag the slider back one notch to the left for more reliability, at the expense of using fewer accelerator functions (slower video performance).<br>
<br>
See "SYSTEM.INI TWEAKS", also in MYTIPS95.TXT (part of W95-11D.ZIP), to learn how to boost your Win9x system, communications, disk, cache, DMA, keyboard etc performance to the MAX.<br>
<br>
And of course you can use Dxdiag.exe (see above) to enable the DirectX 3D video Hardware Acceleration Layer (HAL). Though in some situations (i.e. buggy video drivers) you may want to disable HAL for slower but more stable operation, especially if you own an older (i.e. 2D only) video controller.<br>
<br>
BTW: ALWAYS upgrade your video drivers to their current release from your video board vendor or chipset manufacturer web site, and try to avoid using the generic (usually older, and lacking enhanced/custom features) drivers included with your Windows 9x installation disk(s).<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
14.)  How can I start IE faster?<br>
<br>
"A faster way to start Internet Explorer 4/5. Create a shortcut with the following switch (quotes are needed):<br>
<br>
"C:\Program Files\Internet Explorer\IEXPLORE.EXE" -nohome<br>
<br>
The "-nohome" parameter is used by IE for opening picfiles like .JPG or .GIF. It also starts IE without opening the start page (in my case the famous "about blank").<br>
Note that opening IE like this disables some features until you start browsing the web."<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
15.) How can I manully change the VIDEO REFRESH RATE<br>
<br>
To (re)set your video refresh rate in Windows 9x, open Regedit and go to:<br>
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\Class\Display\0000\Default<br>
<br>
Look in the right hand pane for the "RefreshRate" String. Double-click on it and change its value to -1 for automatic refresh rate. Any other value corresponds to the actual vertical refresh rate frequency in Hz (Hertz), and MUST be supported by BOTH your video controller AND your monitor (CRT), otherwise you may DAMAGE one or the other!<br>
Also if you have installed more that one video driver over time (by swapping video cards or by upgrading to a newer driver version), you may have more than one subkey under the Display key above, like: 0001, 0002 etc. But keep in mind that only the most recent of these keys is "active", probably the one bearing the highest 000n number.<br>
Restart Windows when done to apply the new setting.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
16.) How can I run programs in windows using batch files<br>
<br>
To run Win95/98 programs in a batch file, use START with the "/W" switch.<br>
It's a time saver, and this way you can run more than one Win95/98 program with only a single mouse click. For example, to scan all your fixed disks/partitions for errors, and then fully defragment them, open Notepad and type or copy these lines:<br>
@ECHO OFF<br>
START /W "C:\WINDOWS\SCANDSKW.EXE /A /N"<br>
START /W "C:\WINDOWS\DEFRAG.EXE /ALL /F /NOPROMPT"<br>
EXIT<br>
<br>
Save this file as DISKTOOL.BAT, and create a shortcut for it on your Desktop, or place it into your Startup folder, to run the disk maintenance utilities every time you load Windows, and keep your hard drives "filthy clean".<br>
Just make sure your MS-DOS shortcut Properties -> Program tab (right-click to access) has the "Close on exit" box checked.<br>
MS Plus! for Win95 and Win98/98 SE users can schedule such runs periodically using System Agent or Task Scheduler.<br>
These are START.EXE (located in C:\Windows\Command) command line switches, displayed when running:<br>
<br>
START /?<br>
<br>
from the Run box:<br>
<br>
<br>
"Runs a Windows program or an MS-DOS program.<br>
START [options] program [arg...]<br>
START [options] document.ext<br>
/m[inimized]	Run the new program minimized (in the background).<br>
/max[imized]	Run the new program maximized (in the foreground).<br>
/r[estored]	Run the new program restored (in the foreground). [default]<br>
/w[ait]		Does not return until the other program exits."<br>
NOTES:<br>
<br>
The quotes-unquotes on the START lines are necessary for running apps with Long File Names (LFNs) with program specific command line parameters.<br>
Running Win9x apps from the DOS command line using START, allows for multiple instances of the same program (if supported).<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
17.) How can I change the product registration info in W9X?<br>
<br>
"This is how to change "This Product is Licensed to: ..." without re-installing Windows 9x. Run Regedit.exe, and go to this key:<br>
<br>
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion<br>
<br>
Once there, you can change any of these String values: "RegisteredOrganization", "RegisteredOwner", and/or "ProductId" to whatever your heart desires.<br>
Your Win9x Properties info will display "Registered/Licensed to: Your Name/Company" from now on."<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
18.) How can I change notepads font?<br>
<br>
To change the default font displayed in Notepad, open Regedit and go to:<br>
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Config\0000\Display\Settings<br>
<br>
The 0000 Registry key above might have a different value on your system: 0001, 0002 etc. If that is the case, refer to the appropriate Registry key for your active display settings.<br>
Modify the "fixedfon.fon" string found in the right hand pane, and replace the default Win98/95 display font (vgafix.fon) with the plotter, screen or system fixed font (.FON extension) you want to see in your Notepad documents, and in all other display screens that can make use of this font type.<br>
You can try to use any other .FON file installed in your Windows\Fonts subfolder for that matter.<br>
This change requires a Windows restart to see the effect.<br>
<br>
NOTE: I haven't tried this, but it may also work with True Type Fonts (.TTF extension). These are scalable fonts.<br>
<br>
This is especially useful if you work with Windows 98/95's multi-language support installed, and if the selected font is bilingual. Windows 95 and OSR2 have one limitation though: you can switch from English to any other language only ONCE per session.<br>
<br>
TIP: You may also want to try a better 3rd party replacement for Notepad, that lets you change its display font from within the program.<br>
I recommend the BEST + FASTEST FREEware text/ASCII editor/viewer, the Programmer's File Editor 32-bit for Windows 9x/NT.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
19.)  How can I improve my vcache?<br>
<br>
Here's how to improve it. Type 'sysedit' in your 'start', 'run' dialog box and navigate to "System.ini". In the ini file, look for [vcache] and add/change the following:<br>
<br>
MinFileCache= nnn<br>
MaxFileCache= nnn<br>
ChunkSize= nnn<br>
<br>
(nnn represents a number, multiple of 2)<br>
<br>
'MinFileCache' and 'MaxFileCache' should be the same (about 25% of your RAM) to avoid resizing, 'ChunkSize' should generally be '512', but you can omit that one. You should set MinFileCache and MaxFileCache to about 25% of your ram for best performance, i.e 8190 for 32Mb Ram, 16384 for 64Mb, 32768 for 128Mb...<br>
<br>
These are sample settings from one of our PCs (256Mb Ram, Windows 98)<br>
[vcache]<br>
MinFileCache=65536<br>
MaxFileCache=65536<br>
ChunkSize=512<br>
<br>
Notes: Generally, the more RAM you have, the bigger the Vcache can be. Remember that the RAM used by Vcache can't be used by applications. Also, Windows 98/98SE has better memory managment than 95, so you might not notice much improvement using that tweak.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
20.)<br>
<br>
 Because 98 SE makes better uses of memory, the more RAM you have the lower the % of Vcache you need. For instance, I have 384RAM, and my settings are this:<br>
Min=16384<br>
Max=16384<br>
Chunk=512<br>
<br>
As always the trial and error deal applies until you find the optimal setting for your system <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
21.)<br>
<br>
 !!!!!add the following line under the [386enh] section, leaving a blank line afterwards.<br>
<br>
ConservativeSwapfileUsage=1<br>
<br>
This minimises the usuage of the swap file (as the name might suggest)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
22.)<br>
<br>
 One of the most important factors in dealing with performance is the clutter that accumulates in your HDD. You can use the tools that windows offers but as usual that's not enough. I will outline the areas where cleaning up your HDD becomes crucial and also will provide you with links to free apps that will really delete what windows says it does but in reality it doesn't.<br>
1) Temp Files. Open notepad and type:<br>
@deltree /y c:\windows\temp\*.*<br>
Save that file as Deltemp.bat and place it on your desktop. Now when you want to clean your Temp files simply double click on that batch file you just created and they'll be gone.<br>
<br>
2)Temporary Internet Files. It is not enough to go to Internet Options and choose to delete them. There are literally hundreds of entries that will remain untouched by the windows util. For that reason you need a good app to dig deep and get rid of those parasites LOL Go to http://home.nordnet.fr/~pmdevigne/ and dl the excellent IE Cache Cleaner. Not done yet, there are URL's that don't get deleted by this either, so you need to complement this app with another one (all these progs are tiny dl's). Head on down to http://www.fsm.nl/ward/ and dl the Hidden URL Inspector, better known as The Spider and get ready for a big surprise when it finds pages of untraceable URL's hidden in your TIF.<br>
<br>
3)Cookies. This one is easy. You could write a batch file like the one to delete Temp files, but the problem is that you want to keep some Cookies. Go to http://www.analogx.com and dl the most efficient Cookie Wall that will allow you to keep certain cookies while also nuking the rest of the unwanted leeches <br>
<br>
That will do it for now. You could also look for duplicate files and a bunch of other stuff, but if you want a no risk, fool-proof way to keep your HDD clean of the debris gathered in your www trips, this is more than enough  LOL<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
23.)<br>
<br>
 If you're a parent who doesn't want their kid's messing with their computer, or you're a kid who doesn't want their parent's messing with their computer , there are a few tricks you can do using Regedit. Don't get me wrong, none of these tips will provide anything above a modicum of security, but they will certainly keep the casual user in their place. <br>
Make sure you backup your registry, and you know how to restore from a backup, before trying any of these tips.<br>
<br>
If your desktop is getting a bit crowded, or you want to restrict what other users can do on your PC, you can hide all the desktop icons. Using Regedit, find the following key:<br>
<br>
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer<br>
<br>
Modify or create the Dword value NoDesktop in the right-hand pane. 0 is disabled, while 1 is enabled.<br>
<br>
Another good way to stop the kids (or parents) from poking around your system is to hide drives. This works for all types of drives because it disables drive letters. Find the following key:<br>
<br>
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer<br>
<br>
To create or modify the Dword NoDrives in order to hide or show a drive, you have to change it's hexadecimal value but, seeing as some may not use Hex, it's easier to use the decimal value. So here they are:<br>
<br>
A-1, B-2, C-4, D-8, E-16, F-32, G-64, H-128, I-256, J-512, K-1024, L-2048, M-4096, N-8192, O-16384, P-32768, Q-65536, R-131072, S-262144, T-524288, U-1048576, V-2097152, W-4194304, X-8388608, Y-16777216, Z-33554432<br>
<br>
Phew! If you want to hide all drives (not quite sure why you'd want to, but), modify the Dword to become 67108863. However, while hidden from Explorer, these drives will still be visible in file manager.<br>
<br>
If you want to remove the Network Neighbourhood icon from your desktop, find the following key<br>
<br>
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer<br>
<br>
Modify or create the following Dword NoNetHood and set it to 0 for disabled or 1 for enabled.<br>
<br>
If you want to be really cautious, you can prevent certain applications from being run on your PC. To do it, find this key:<br>
<br>
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer<br>
<br>
Create a Dword called RestrictRun and modify it's value to 1 to enable or 0 to disable. Next, under:<br>
<br>
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\<br>
<br>
Create a new key called RestrictRun. Now, within this key you need to create a string value for each application that you want to enable. Start by creating a string value of 1 and then modify it's data to be the executable of the application you wish to disable, such as regedit.exe. The next application has to have a value of 2, increase numerically for each application. WARNING Be very careful using this key, because if you don't put Regedit.exe in your enabled list, you won't be able to get back into the registry, unless you restore from a backup.<br>
<br>
Also under this key: <br>
<br>
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer<br>
<br>
You can remove various items from your Start menu, create a new Dword for each item you want to remove, 1 to remove from the menu or 0 to leave it as it is:<br>
<br>
No Recent Documents - NoRecentDocsMenu<br>
No Favorites Folder - NoFavoritesMenu<br>
No Help - NoSMHelp<br>
No Log-off User - NoLogOff<br>
<br>
All of these registry hacks offer minimum challenges to anyone who is serious about using your PC. If you really want to be secure, you should use these in conjunction with the Policy Editor, user settings and password protection.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
24.) How do I Turn Off Delete Confirmation?<br>
<br>
To turn off delete confirmation: <br>
<br>
Right-click the Recycle Bin <br>
Select Properties from the context menu, and select the Global tab <br>
Make sure that the check box for Display delete confirmation dialog box is unchecked <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
25.) How do I perform A Complete Defrag?<br>
<br>
A Complete Defrag (attrib)- When you're loosing performance, the first app you look to is probably M$ Disk Defragmenter Norton SpeedDisk. This will solve most of the problems, but it's not the 'whole story'. No matter how hard you try, no app can POSSIBLY defrag your entire drive because some files are always in use or otherwise reserved. <br>
To ensure that every file is defragmented, you will first have to disable your disk cache and virtual memory. These files must be disabled, as they are other wise used no matter what. First, let's disable the virtual memory. Open the' System' applet of the Control Panel (WINKEY+Pause/Brk) and select the 'Performance' tab. Open the "Virtual Memory..." dialog and select "Let me specify my own VM settings". Check "Disable virtual memory" and click "Yes" at the confirmation dialog. When asked to reboot, click No. Now it's time to disable your cache. This can be simply done with the CacheMan 3.80 utility or manually like this: <br>
<br>
To disable your disk cache, you will need to set the following values to in your System.ini: <br>
<br>
[vcache] <br>
mincachefile=0 <br>
maxcachefile=0 <br>
minfilecache=0 <br>
maxfilecache=0 <br>

Now both your virtual memory and disk cache have been turned off. The next step is to boot to MS-DOS and do the following: <br>
C:\>attrib -r -a -s -h /s <br>
<br>
The purpose of this command is to remove the "read-only", "archive", "system", and "hidden" attributes for each file in the C drive. This allows Disk Defragmenter to defrag all files, even the hidden and 'write protected' ones. When the protocol is done (may take a while depending on how many files & dirs you have), simply reboot and do a defrag. don't forget to restore virtual memory and disk cache when you're done! <br>
NOTE: The attrib command can be very dangerous under certain conditions. Some of these include UMSDOS Linux (it screws the configs beyond repair) read errors and damaged configs. Also, if you have a billion+1 files and weird Linux dirs on your drive, you may experience what's known as a "buffer overflow" which means that DOS has done too many things in too short a time. Typing WIN' to get back to Windows will produce a fatal VFAT error message. Simply reboot and you'll be fine. If you have Linux on the same partitions Windows DO NOT do this command! You could do it for every dir separately (aka path name and no /s), but that would take forever. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
26.)  <br>
<br>
Make sure that your msdos.sys says DoubleBuffer=0 and not DoubleBuffer=1<br>
If you have Microsoft Plus, you should also go to Add and Remove Programs, select Microsoft Plus, then Add and Remove, it will take you to a selection list, select Add/Remove again, and Remove DriveSpace3. <br>

27.)  <br>
<br>
there is a value in your registry called 'SLOWNET' and it is usually set at '01' change this to '00'<br>
It won't dramatically increase your transfers but it will reduce timeouts. The key is as follows:<br>
<br>
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE<br>
\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\Class\Net\0001<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
28.)  How do I Hide Annoying ScreenTips?<br>
<br>
Step 1: Open Explorer and choose View, Folder Options. Click the View tab and uncheck the box labeled Show Pop-up Description for Folder and Desktop Items. <br>
<br>
Step 2: Open Registry Editor, find the key HKEY_CURRENT_USERControl Paneldesktop, and locate UserPreferencemask. This value consists of four groups of two characters. You'll need to change the first character in the first value; if the value is AE 00 00 00, for example, the character you'll change is A.<br>
<br>
Step 3: Double-click the UserPreferencemask value and replace the first two-character value. Use the following list to replace the first character: A=2, B=3, C=4, E=6, 8=0. Do not change the second character. For example, AE becomes 2E.<br>

29.) How can I rebuild the registry?<br>
<br>
REBUILDING THE REGISTRY<br>
<br>
Note: If you are experience problems with the registry or suspect<br>
that your registry is corrupted correct this problem before trying this<br>
tip. <br>
<br>
1. Backup the registry by running scanregw.<br>
2. Run RegEdit and export the registry to C:\Windows\NewReg.reg<br>
3. Restart your PC. Press F8 during boot and choose command<br>
prompt only.<br>
4. Enable a 8MB disk cache with writebehind caching by typing<br>
smartdrv 8192 8192 C+.<br>
5. Change to Windows directory at the command prompt type<br>
RegEdit /C NewReg.reg.<br>
<br>
Note: This procedure can take a few minutes to run. If the<br>
procedure does not complete restore your registry from the backup<br>
and continue.<br>
<br>
30.) How to change CPU priority and delay<br>
<br>
Local machine/sys/ccs/services/VxD/bois/ add binary value.....CPUDelayTime 01 <br>
is one that i came up with...it has worked on 3 computer...with no problams....win 98 <br>
<br>
<br>
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\VxD\BIOS<br>
On the right hand pane create a DWord value and call it "CPUPriority" (no quotes, of course), click on it and at the dialog box checl the decimal box and give it a value of 1 (default is 3)<br>
<br>
31.)FASTER INTERNET<br>
<br>
<br>
It seems that in addition to the new entry for the Win98 Global TCP/IP bug fix (also in TIPS98.TXT, part of W95-11D.ZIP) in the MSTCP parameters, as well as all the described Registry fixes in your other articles, not only improved the speed of my Internet connection, but also dramatically improves my browsing speed if you add these three new entries under the "MSTCP" Registry key, as shown in this REG file:<br>
<br>
<br>
-----Begin cut & paste here-----<br>
REGEDIT4<br>
<br>
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\VxD\MSTCP]<br>
"Tcp1323Opts"="1"<br>
"SackOpts"="1"<br>
"BSDUrgent"="1"<br>
<br>
------End cut & paste here------<br>
Copy this text in Notepad, save it with the .REG extension, then right-click on it in Explorer and select Merge.<br>
Here are the recommended values:<br>
<br>
<br>
- Tcp1323Opts   String Value    Value: 1<br>
- SackOpts      String Value    Value: 1<br>
- BSDUrgent     String Value    Value: 1<br>
All above settings (and more) are described in this MSKB article."<br>
<br>
NOTE: MSKB incorrectly lists "Tcp1323Opts" as DWORD Value for Win9x/ME.<br>
<br>
32.) MANAGE YOUR POWER!<br>
<br>
<br>
If you:<br>
encounter random system errors while trying to open a program,<br>
see a yellow exclamation sign next to one of these Control Panel -> System -> Device Manager items: "Advanced Power Management support", "Display adapters", "Modem", "Network adapters", "PCMCIA devices", "Universal Serial Bus controllers" etc, even if you know there are NO IRQ/DMA/COMmunication port conflicts,<br>
are bothered by intermittent CRT display flicker upon "waking up" after being in "stand by"/"suspend" mode (which may in time wear off your monitor),<br>
get knocked off frequently from your otherwise functional Internet/modem/network hookup,<br>
experience (too) long delays when your monitor/hard disk(s) "wake up" after "hibernation" mode,<br>
you may want to turn off completely ALL your Windows 9x/ME power management features (like I did).<br>
NECESSARY STEPS:<br>
<br>
<br>
First enter your BIOS/CMOS Setup by pressing the appropriate key (usually Del) specified in your computer/motherboard manual during the bootup POST (Power On Self Test) screen, and DISABLE ALL (Advanced) Power Management (APM/ACPI) settings, like: "Doze Mode", "Standby Mode", "Suspend Mode", "HDD Power Down", "Video Off" etc. Save your changes and reboot.<br>
<br>
After your Windows GUI comes up: open Control Panel -> Power Management -> select the "Always on" Power scheme -> make sure the "Turn off monitor" and "Turn off hard disks" boxes show "Never" -> click OK/Apply to save changes.<br>
<br>
Edit your SYSTEM.INI file (found in your Windows folder) with Notepad or Sysedit (but BACKUP IT UP FIRST!) -> go to the:<br>
<br>
[boot] section -> look for the "power.drv" entry on the "drivers=" line -> move it to a new line of its own starting with a semicolon (;) to disable it (example):<br>
[boot]<br>
drivers=mmsystem.dll whatever.vxd etc...<br>
; power.drv<br>
<br>
DO NOT remark/disable ANY other filenames on the "drivers=" line!<br>
<br>
<br>
[386enh] section -> look for the "device=*vpowerd" line -> disable it by placing a semicolon (;) in front of it (example):<br>
[386enh]<br>
; device=*vpowerd<br>
<br>
Save your file.<br>
<br>
<br>
BACKUP YOUR REGISTRY FILES: SYSTEM.DAT and USER.DAT!<br>
<br>
Run Regedit:<br>
<br>
Go to:<br>
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE<br>
<br>
and then to:<br>
<br>
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\VxD\VCOMM<br>
<br>
Under each key above -> double-click on the "EnablePowerManagement" DWORD/Binary (depending on your Win9x/ME release) value in the right hand pane -> change ALL characters to read 0 (zero) -> click OK/press Enter.<br>
<br>
<br>
Click Edit from the Regedit menu -> select Find -> start 3 separate Registry searches: type "power.drv", "vpower" and "vpowr" respectively (no quotes) in the "Find what..." box -> delete ALL found keys/entries.<br>
<br>
Move to a safe BACKUP location these 2 files from C:\Windows\System: POWER.DRV and VPOWERD.VXD.<br>
<br>
Disable ANY Power Management entries from the System Agent (Task Scheduler) list.<br>
<br>
Reboot.<br>
Your Windows machine should perform significantly smoother from now on, without annoying interruptions or intermittent errors. :)<br>
<br>
33.)MAPPED DISK CACHE<br>
<br>
This is a fragment quoted from the "Windows 98 Mtsutil.txt File" MSKB article:<br>
"Windows 98 supports the mapping of cached pages to increase the amount of memory available to running applications. The Windows 98 memory manager architecture divides memory into 2 parts:<br>
<br>
Protected-mode disk cache (VCACHE)<br>
Memory allocated to run programs and hold data (VMM)<br>
Reading from memory is much faster than reading from the hard disk. VCACHE improves performance by reducing the number of times the hard disk is accessed. A process in memory will demand a particular section of code; if that section of code is in VCACHE, it can be accessed and used much more quickly than if that section of code needs to be read from a file on disk.<br>
For example, if you were to launch an application, close it, and then shortly thereafter launch it a second time, the application's launch time would now be noticeably reduced. This is a result of copying much of the application from VCACHE instead of the hard disk.<br>
Memory allocated to the disk cache is not available to executing processes.<br>
Reducing the amount of memory available to running applications negatively impacts performance by increasing the amount of data swapped from memory to the hard disk."<br>
What does all this "mumbo-jumbo" mean? Basically Win98 will act faster if a portion of the computer's memory is allocated for the fixed disk "mapped cache", thus avoiding frequent access to the slower swap file (supplemental "virtual" memory located on the fixed disk). The disadvantage is (only obvious on PCs with less than 64 MB of RAM) that this "retained" memory is not available to applications anymore, thus reducing the amount of memory Windows 98 can "play" with.<br>
Therefore it is recommended to enable the Win98 "mapped cache" feature on machines with at least 64 MB RAM (and definitively if you have 128 MB or more), to improve performance at the expense of little less memory available to programs.<br>
To do so, start Regedit and go to:<br>
<br>
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\VxD\VMM<br>
<br>
In the right hand pane, make sure the "MapCache" Binary value is not present.<br>
If you see it, delete it: right-click on it and select Delete or highlight it and press Del, then click Yes or press Enter.<br>
Close the Registry Editor and restart Windows.<br>
To disable the "mapped cache" on Win98 systems with less than 64 MB RAM (and definitively if you have 32 MB or less), run Regedit, and scroll down to the Registry key above.<br>
Create a new "MapCache" entry: right-click on an empty spot in the Regedit screen, select New -> Binary Value -> type in MapCache (its value is of no importance, according to Microsoft) -> click OK or press Enter.<br>
Exit the Registry Editor and restart Windows.<br>
The information quoted above is also available in the Mtsutil.txt file, located on the Win98 Setup cd-rom, in the \TOOLS\MTSUTIL subfolder. Open it in Notepad for reading.<br>
You can also enable "mapped cache" without "messing" with the Registry, by running MAPC_ON.INF, or disable it by installing MAPC_OFF.INF. These are 2 information (.INF) files, also found in \TOOLS\MTSUTIL.<br>
To do this, right-click on the one you want in Explorer, select Install, and finally restart Windows.<br>
<br>
NOTE: For details on how to configure your "mapped cache" for maximum performance on your Win98 system, read "MAP THE CACHE", also in TIPS98.TXT, part of my Win9x/2000/ME/XP + DOS 7/8 ©Tricks + Secrets files [W95-11D.ZIP].<br>

Perhaps next time you do this you could actually explain to the rest of the people that dont understand computers what these things actually do.<br>
<br>
Telling people that such a switch is the same as doing such a thing is fantastic but unless you add &quot;and this stops your machine blowing up&quot; or &quot;this tells your graphics card to run faster&quot; makes it pretty useless.<br>
<br>
It makes good bed time reading now. In fact I started snoring at number 6. <p><CENTER><A HREF="http://ak.lonelygamer.com">

Just reading portions from Recant's tweak tips lost me, certainly I don't remember changes that will make SoL code perform better. <br>
<br>
Was there any "Optimised for Embedded SSE" memory cache pipelining flagbit I had to set, does Verant have the CPM PERT/node diagrams on EVERY process's bus cycle i/o address the assembler programmers asked for. Is "Streaming SIMD Execution" in fact MMX with a clientside plan? Will Gates solve the crisis in ClockGen resolution bewildering the best cpu's in 3D intensive Virtual Environment object images? Can Stars be scanned and stripped to a region of singularity possessing a mathematical value (no matter how small), one slice off at a time. What is the best minimum volumetric depth increment for a pixel today?<br>
