<br>
I started in the Hybernian realm as a druid.  My wife started as a nightshade.<br>
<br>
Rogues were so busted, the fixes were promised and never came.  Sanya even &quot;started a rogue&quot; at one point, so she could see the problems.<br>
<br>
Last I looked, the &quot;fix&quot; was climbing.  Gee.  Oh wait, that's not until you're rather high level.  Good luck getting there, groups don't want you.  To do damage output takes a lot of setup, and better hope the mob doesn't path in on the pull past you, because he'll wack you and there goes stealth and with it the big damage opener.  (Perhaps this is fixed now, this was a few months ago we gave up.)<br>
<br>
Onto death and healing:<br>
<br>
Death is way to fast.  Being the primary healing class for the realm was, for me, an exercise in futility.  Death came so fast, in a lot of cases the way to play was to have 3-4 healers chain casting heals on the tanks.  This was in the high teens low 20s, btw.  And even then, people would die.<br>
<br>
A few more beefs:<br>
We went into daoc thinking the death penalty would be a lot less then in EQ.  Sure enough, not losing your stuff is great.  And in hindsight, that's what got played up by the marketing.  The XP loss on the other hand....bleh.  Ok, they fixed it at a certain percentage.<br>
<br>
BUT<br>
<br>
There's no way to recover as much xp from a death as you can in EQ.  And for even more fun, the guy that can rez a group on a wipeout, can't get a rez.<br>
<br>
For those that don't know, xp loss and death are two-fold.<br>
<br>
First you're killed.  You lose a certain amount of xp.  There is no way to ever get this xp back.  Your viewpoint is now floating above your corpse.  You can do tells, but cannot select anything, do says, shouts, etc.  So no selecting that rezzer that just ran past over there (just out of range of seeing a name over the head, of course).<br>
<br>
So now you either:<br>
<br>
1. get a rez -- you come back with a percentage of your health/mana/sta based on the level of the spell used to rez you.  You suffer &quot;death effects&quot; for a while.<br>
<br>
2. release -- now you're back at your bind spot and a gravestone is built where you died.  You lose more xp.  You can get some of this xp back by returning to your grave and &quot;praying&quot;.  Your CON goes down three points.  Getting those points back involves a visit to an npc and paying him cash for each point.  The higher level you are, the more you pay.  It gets bad.<br>
<br>
My first rvr experience:<br>
<br>
As soon as I hit level 15 (this was shortly after release) off I went with guildmates to do rvr.  After all, 15 was when rvr was supposed to start, right? (um, no months later Mythic admits rvr was designed as a 40+ thing.)<br>
<br>
Walk out past our border fort.  BOOM arrow comes in, one dead druid.  This was when archers could fire and stay stealthed.  A lot of my group got wiped.  Someone who played a lot more then we did had gotten 5-10 more levels then us.  <br>
<br>
I suspect a good analogy would be a group of level 10 eq characters going up against Dvinn.  It'd last about as long.<br>
<br>
Points to &quot;level&quot; your character:<br>
This was one of the most frustrating areas of the game for me.  There is basically no documentation on this.  There is no unspending your points to respend them when they change the game making your old choices moot, stupid, or what have you.<br>
<br>
These points totally define your character.  And yet, you're supposed to guess where to put them for the most part.  Over the months, I would see statements released from Mythic for this and that class type, put this there that there, etc.  Nice, gee, thanks for telling us AFTER we spent them.<br>
<br>
Not to mention that some classes are STILL getting new lines one could have spent points in!<br>
<br>
To sum up:<br>
1. Game isn't finished<br>
2. Expectations from marketing didn't meet reality.  Not even close, really.<br>
3. They nurf stuff too, I'm not even going into that.<br>
4. Having to spend points on your character sucks in this game.<br>
<br>
This is all my opinion.  Your mileage will vary.<br>

I think a lot of what you get out of the game is who you play with and what server you picked. Right now we're (TGL) still having loads of fun on Bedevere in Midgard.<br>

I am happy to say the end game has gotten much better in the last month, it isn't perfect yet (I don't think any game will ever be perfect) but at least enough changes have gone in to make it interesting and worth playing for now.<br>
<br>
First off let me say...straight RVR hasn't really changed much, most battles are still over way to quick for my taste, but on average I don't RVR this way anymore.  Most of the realm points I have received in the last 2 weeks have been from taking or defending keeps.  BTW this is because of my personal/guild play style, I have decide not to do individual RVR much because of my class and play times.  If a person wanted there is more then enough opportunity for it.<br>
<br>
Recent Changes in DAoC:<br>
1) Resists--resists have been redone and actually mean something.  (I find the current item cap of 26% annoying but that is just me...at least it means something to get your resists up now.)<br>
2) High End Content--each realm now has an additional high end zone (with a boss mob--dragon), and at least as far as Midgard goes all the zones are itemized except the frontier.  (This has not only made it much easier to find good hunting grounds and relieved the overcrowding of Spinda, but it is much easier to get high end items now.  WOOT, I haven't killed a Outcast in 3 weeks!!! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  )<br>
3) Bounty Points--individual bounty points still don't do jack (All you can buy are some halfassed potions at a insane cost.) but guild bounty points (which come from individual bounty points) now allow you to claim keeps...which in turn allow you to rack up guild realm points. (So far other then putting your guild higher on the total list these do not do much but from what I have heard they are eventually going to grant guild bonuses.)<br>
4) Realm Points--the bonus for skills finally went in today, so having realm points and rank actually increase your stats.  (Rumor has it more things are coming with this at some point but at least for now it is no longer just a number to get your name higher on the howmanypeopleIhaveganked list.)<br>
5) Relics--realms finally receive a bonus for holding other realm relics. (10% per relic for melee or spells depending on which relic you hold.)<br>
<br>
IMO the game still isn't done, but in the last month they have added enough to at least keep me from being bored out of my mind and at least I have a few reasons to get realm points now.<br>

  Pretty meaningless post anyway, since if you'll notice the previous post was a month ago.

Like someone said tho Mythic is still building, but how much can you build on to nothing. They have added Epic zones YAY! whcih were farmed to death and are old now. There is always the dragon right? We killed him already here are some pics for ya.<br>

<br>
Well you could always continue to kill the ubers in Llyn Barfog when the had them enter the game and increased their loot drops.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.hcof.net/azzlano/pics/Afanc1.jpg">www.hcof.net/azzlano/pics/Afanc1.jpg</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

<br>
Then they just added a new dungeon call Darkness Falls where all three realms can enter by cliaiming the most keeps. This dungeon is pretty good the ubers drop some really nice loot and you get some ok loot when you farm diamond seals. However Legion the boss mob has already been killed a couple times.<br>
<br>

<br>
So now that you have done everything, you only have RvR which battles last for oh say a few minutes before one realm or another decides to zerg. Not to mention class balancing which totally sucks.<br>
<br>

It all depends on the person really. You can always find stuff to do but how aften can you do it. My turning point was in RvR I made rank 4 and started to get annoyed at the fact I would run to emain get killed in about 10 minutes from the 2 dozen archers/Stealthers and have to go back. Whats the point? Like I said it all comes down to a personnal preferance. <p>Azzlano Resho<BR>
