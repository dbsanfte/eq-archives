25-Year-Old Detroit Woman Jailed Without Bond<br>
<br>
Posted: 10:17 a.m. EDT July 2, 2002<br>
Updated: 12:15 p.m. EDT July 2, 2002<br>
<br>
<br>
DETROIT -- Oakland County Prosecutor David Gorcyca is looking into the criminal record of a pregnant Detroit mother accused of leaving her children trapped inside a hot car. <br>
<br>
Court records showed that Tarajee Maynor (pictured, left), 25, ignored court dates and traffic tickets. Her driver's license was suspended three times and she has been barred from driving since 1999. <br>
<br>
Maynor is charged with two counts of felony murder. Oakland County prosecutors said that Maynor left her 10-month-old daughter, Acacia, and 3-year-old son, Adonnis, in the car Friday while getting her hair done at a Southfield salon. <br>
<br>
The children reportedly died from hyperthermia after being in the black Dodge Neon for about three hours in the sweltering heat. Temperatures in the car reportedly topped 100 degrees and the children likely survived only 20 to 40 minutes, Local 4 reported. <br>
<br>
Prosecutors said that Maynor knew the dangers of the heat. <br>
<br>
Gorcyca appeared on CNN's &quot;Connie Chung Tonight&quot; Monday, calling Maynor &quot;a pretty callous woman.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;This mother bears no maternal instincts,&quot; Gorcyca told CNN. &quot;She placed these two children in a little inferno, and had to know that there was going to be dire consequences.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;She knew it was hot. She put the kids in the car. She cracked the window,&quot; Oakland County Assistant Prosecutor Kate McNamara told Local 4. &quot;She spent over three hours in a salon, never checking on them once.&quot; <br>
<br>
Southfield police said that Maynor also drove around three hours with the dead children in her car before taking them to the hospital. Once at the hospital, she reportedly told investigators that she had been abducted and raped, Local 4 reported. <br>
<br>
Investigators said that the evidence and her story did not match, and began to interview her further. Police said that she eventually confessed to leaving the children inside the car. She reportedly told police that she was trying to figure out what to do as she drove around for three hours after discovering they had died. <br>
<br>
Southfield Police Chief Joseph Thomas said that he is trying to make an example out of her. &quot;It's part of our efforts to keep Southfield safe and secure,&quot; Thomas told The Oakland Press. &quot;There are governmental agencies that are willing to stand up for young people like the two that died in that crime.&quot; <br>
<br>
Thomas told the paper that there are some people who should not have the right to have kids. <br>
<br>
Maynor remained silent during her weekend arraignment. If convicted on the murder charges, she could spend the rest of her life in prison. <br>
<br>
Maynor is currently being held in jail without bond. The judge agreed to keep her in jail until her case is decided. Prosecutors also want to take custody of her unborn child, Local 4 reported. <br>

<br>
If there was a reason to finally hit a women, a reason to beat the living snot out of a female by man, and still have the countries ok to do it, I think it should be this MOTHAH FUGGIN BIZNITCH that we pick for the beating.<br>
<br>
What do ya think? <br>
<br>
Life in jail and NO custody of her un-born child? Or ship her dumb fookin ass to Texas and put a Colt .45 round in her head?     After she has her kid obviously...<br>
<br>
Actually, I have another idea to &quot;take care of her&quot;. We can just get her same black Dodge Neon, and lock her dumb a$$ in the car and let her DIE!!!!<br>

I think anything you did to this woman wouldn't be enough justice for the children that lost their lives. <br>

The only hope in this case, is for them to take the unborn baby and at least give one of the three children a chance at a good life.<br>

Had the same thing happen in Denver just this past week. Last summer, an 18 year old mother who worked at McDonald's left her 3 year old son in her car while she worked an 8 hour shift. The little boy died and the mother's defense was she thought she had dropped him off at the babysitter before going to work. I do not leave my almost 5 year old son in the car by himself even if it's just a quick run into the convenience store to pay for gas (nor leave the vehicle running as well, there has also been incidents wherein a running car was left unattended with a child in it and the vehicle was carjacked). Parents bring their purse/wallet in to keep it close to them, they should do the same for their child (just my opinion). I am glad we can pay for the gas at the pump nowadays. I suppose it gets tricky when you have several children in the vehicle, I don't know, never had to worry about that yet =).<br>
I do hope they make an example out of that mother. If the salon she went to does not encourage bringing her children in, she can have a friend watch them. If not, she should have rescheduled or find another salon that has an area for children to occupy themselves. I guess her new hairstyle will do her well in prison.<br>

To this woman, leaving the children in the car for 3 hours, is like leaving a pan of milk on the stove while we answer the phone. We make that decision to answer the phone and we pay with it by getting burnt milk all over the worktop.<br>
<br>
This is exactly the same for her. She thinks that it's easier for her to leave the kids in the car and she pays with it by going to jail. I would say she pays by losing her kids but I don't think Im the only one wondering if she cares. <p><CENTER><A HREF="http://ak.lonelygamer.com">

Everything you do from that point forward is for the welfare of those children.<br>

I read this story on the Straight Dope yesterday afternoon, the news story I read was much more horrific and described how the 3 year old had unbuckled his younger sister's seatbelt in an attempt to help her and how they had left tiny mouthprints on the window in an attempt to get air.  They were covered with vomit when she found them, and she drove around for 3 hours with her poor dead children while trying to construct an alibi.<br>
<br>
I shut my office door and cried for 10 minutes.<br>
<br>
There is no punishment suitable for this person.   The only thing close is to lock her in a tiny, hot, suffocating room that is plastered with pictures of her children so she can suffer like they did every day for the rest of her miserable life.   I guess that would be cruel and usual punishment, but it is so warranted!!! <p><a href="http://www.saraquael.com/gloriana.html"><img src="http://fyd.fuxored.net/glorymedium.jpg" border="0"></a><p>

Sadlly, there are too many people who don't realize this.  For some people, having kids is another status symbol, kinda like owning a Jag.  They want something cute that all of their friends can oooo and aaaa over, but they don't care for them nearly as much as they should.  I wish there were some way to sterilize these people, but how could you tell?  Anyone can put on a good face.<br>

This is a prime example of why I don't read the news.  90% of it is bad.  I'm not one to bury my head in the sand, because I know full well the capability of our species for both good and bad, I just don't like to be confronted with it every day, especially when, in cases like these, there is nothing I can do about it. <p>"I will take love wherever I find it and offer it to everyone who will take it, seek knowledge from those wiser, and teach those who wish to learn from me" - Duane Allman</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uinmountains.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Inmountains</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 134<br> <font color=#E9D756>(7/2/02 2:42:48 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3449.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Negligent Mom</span><hr size=1> As a single father of 3 children, it is refreshing to see all these posts here.

Damn straight.  I -know- I'm not ready to raise a kid, chances are I never will be... the only reason I haven't had a vascetomy yet is the chance that somehow, one day, I might change my mind.<br>
<br>
Not any time soon though : ).<br>
<br>
  I've often thought you should have to pass a parenting test or something similar to have kids.  Some kind of license maybe.  Just like you should have to have a license to use a computer... <p><image src=http://homepages.paradise.net.nz/lpb/laokesig2.jpg></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uialanye.showPublicProfile?language=EN>ialanye</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://mywebpages.comcast.net/jwebb2/Iala_sig.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 131<br> <font color=#E9D756>(7/2/02 8:19:12 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3449.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: re. </span><hr size=1> Mother of two here.

But, I do know that when they go to jail and the crimes  come out of what they do  they pay for it over and over... mind you IMHO this is not enough but it is a start.  Child killers and molesters are the worse for those in prison .. seems there is some form of &quot;code&quot;.

I can't believe that any being capable of doing something this evil could be considered a human being.  She drove around for 3 fvcking hours with the children's bodies before going to a hospital!?!  <br>

Gloriana and Laoke- Me and the woman were talking about this the other day. We plan on having this child, and possibly a second, but that being the maximum (in our ideal set up of course. =D) <br>
<br>
Why is it all the idiots in the world seem to want to produce as many of their own little oxygen converters, while the intelligent quality folk seem to go childless or produce few offspring.<br>
<br>
It's kind of depressing, and why the 'average' intelligence in America is so low, I guess. *sigh*<br>
