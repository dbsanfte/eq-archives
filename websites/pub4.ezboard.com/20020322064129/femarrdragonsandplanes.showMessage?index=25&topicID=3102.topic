This is a big one for me. Elitist assholes. Ya, okay so you're only allowed to have one child in China (at least I think that's the law).. so if your kid is born deformed, or retarded, or with Down's Syndrome, it's common.. read COMMON practice to murder that child until you get a healthy one.<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Actually, it's not quite so common in urbanized cities.  If we're talking about the more rural areas (i.e., poor), such as Hunan, then yes, it's more common to see people abandon daughters and such.  But then again, what underdeveloped and poor area doesn't have its problems?<br>

Pricks. You're born. You grow up. You have kids. Accept what you are given. Who the FUCK are you to make decisions.

Your fucking country has 1/5th the world's population, one more Xiang won't be missed fag. <br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
It's not quite so easy when your culture is very, very big on family.  It's not so much about carrying on the family name as it is about securing your retirement.  They don't have retirement homes in Asian society.  Their heirs are the ones that take in the family elders, not old-folks homes.  Is it right to prefer sons to daughters?  I say no, but who's to say my cup of tea is right for everybody else?  But is killing off unwanted daughters the way to go?  No.  But China isn't the only one who's practiced that.  Look at British and Roman history when aristocratic families mourned with the births of daughters.  <br>
<br>
I've known quite a few women/girls from China who are loved by their parents.  You know how black women lay the law down in their homes?  That's how mainland women are like.  There is no degredation of women there.  Plus, I've known many Chinese women/girls who are beloved by their parents.  I was born overseas.  By your generalization, were my parents supposed to kill me off?  <br>
<br>
The news that gets overseas from China is the tantillizing and unbelievable news.  Don't just look at what you see in the latest issue of Marie Claire and think that's how things are 24/7 over there.  You look at China and you think &quot;inhumane bastards.&quot;  Well, China looks at you and all they see are tales of mothers drowning their children and children blowing up schools and shooting teachers.  I'll bet you they're thinking the same thing about us.<br>

I don't think it was &quot;China Sucks&quot;...'<br>
<br>
Ignorance can be a bad thing.  I wonder if some have thought of it this way.  Do you think those women that &quot;sacrifice&quot; a child do it with a smile?  Do you think they happily hand over their beautiful daughter to an orphanage?  Or do you think that perhaps because she knows she has one shot at the family being taken care of, she gives up her soul and heart at that moment?<br>
<br>
I have a son that I placed for adoption when I was 16.  I will tell you know it was the hardest decision I ever made in my entire life.  I didn't do it because he was a boy and I wanted a girl, I did it because I was way too young to handle the responsibility of having children and I knew it.  <br>
<br>
It's the same concept there.  A lot of chinese born children are placed for adoption/orphaned per year.  I have to wonder if the children who are murdered are done so because if you don't meet a certain social status, or can't reach a facility due to geographic location, could it be that is their only choice?  <br>
<br>
I'm not condoning the murder of a child that has been born.  Just considering what it might be like there.  <br>
<br>
We had a huge wall map when I worked at British Airways.  You look at the population vs. size it's not a pretty sight.  <br>
<br>
Last point....Don't insult Aishen.  I might have to get ugly with someone for that...<br>

<br>
The fact is, the dickhead portrayed could've been from anywhere. The fact that he is Chinese makes him a soft target in the eyes of a few. And is totally and completely unrelated to the issue at hand. This incident isn't unique to China, isn't unique to Bahrain or the far side of the goddamned moon. It, sadly, happens everywhere. A couple of schoolkids in Australia a few years back boiled ducklings in a pot just to see how long it'd take to kill them.<br>
<br>
I hope they string this motherfucking whore from the mizzen yardarm for it. I really do.<br>
<br>
They won't though. No country I know of has legislation providing for the hanging from the neck until you are fucking dead for the mutilation of defenseless creatures. Unless that creature is a human...<br>
<br>
/irate rant off.<br>
<br>
No fuck it, /irate rant on again.<br>

Fuck you narrowminded cunts for even suggesting that it's typical of Chinese people to do this. It's typical of born fucking lame assed loser motherfuckers to do this. And they come from everywhere. <br>
