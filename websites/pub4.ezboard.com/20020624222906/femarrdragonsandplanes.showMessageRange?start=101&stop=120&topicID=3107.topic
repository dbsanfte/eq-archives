The number of superfund sites is expected to rise under Bushes lenient watch and penalties. Some estimate say it could be as high as 25-30% short. So what does this mean?<br>
<br>
Either one of two things, sites don't get cleaned properly or at all or....yup raise in taxes or cut in other programs. Since we are in a state of national emergency we will most likely not scale back any military or bureaucratic waste, even if star wars doesn't work on paper even yet and is a violation of a few treaties &quot;we need it now more than ever&quot;. Even though it WOULD NOT have prevented any of the tragedy of S11. So either the cuts come from social reform programs or a tax raise, which will come through a democratic Senate. Come election time every conservative is going to be pointing those propsed tax hikes out while completely denying they were the result of it. I bet the Democrats are stupid enough to set themselves up for this. <br>

Tell me, if the number of people going to "teacher college" (whatever that is) is so mind-boggling, why do we have such a dearth of teachers?  What are we doing with all these spare teachers?  If we have so many teachers, yhy are school districts desperate for subs?  I live in one of the best 100 school districts in the United States -- why is there no one to fill the empty post of 3rd grade teacher at one of the local elementary schools?  Why is there no Middle School Librarian?  I'll tell you why -- because there are so few teachers!<br>
Now, as for teachers vs. lawyers, I have a first-hand view on that.  My mother is a teacher.  My father is a lawyer.  Both are directly responsible for hiring.  In a single year, my father turns away more hopefull associates than my mother has seen applicants in her entire career.  That's because there are oh-so-many teachers and oh-so-few lawyers, you see.<br>

While it is true their are many people who enroll in elementary education and other related fields it is probably also one of the greatest where they do not persue careers in their chosen field. Why? Because we don't pay them enough. Being a secretary for some business is a lot less stressful and usually a lot better pay. <br>

I was struck by the similarities between Jack Welch and my grandfather, Walter Hoving, chairman of Tiffany &amp; Co. for 25 years. I was also struck by the differences. I wondered what Walter Hoving would have done if he had been told his company was responsible for creating 81 toxic Superfund sites across the U.S. through PCB contamination.<br>
<br>
Would he have launched a public-relations campaign downplaying the toxicity of fish tainted with PCBs, a compound banned worldwide? Would he have spent large amounts of shareholder money on a lobbying campaign to amend the federal Superfund law to limit industry liability for the costs of toxic cleanups?<br>
<br>
I think not. My grandfather's sense of responsibility to the country he loved included a moral conviction to do what is right. Welch epitomizes the stereotypical corporate leader whose sense of responsibility is driven by the short-term bottom line. The things that inspire many of today's business leaders to greatness are a sad departure from what made business leaders great in my grandfather's time.<br>

Hmm... guess superfund isn't just about screwing the rich. It seems a wealthy person here is supporting it. 81 superfund sites! Some estimates say Welch is responsible for 62 some say 85 any which way that is a lot of cleanup. Perhaps that amount of environmental destruction is the price to pay, for under Welch's watch GE rose form a worth of 12 billion to a worth of 280 billion. Think of all those jobs that money probably created, right Cenelron? But, wait......there's more....Yes during his reign Jack Welch magaged to cut GE's American workforce by 50%. During the Clinton administration Welch was one of the primary critics of Superfund laws. Who can blame him? If forced to pay for their clean ups GE might not have been able to pay his $94000000 a year salary or any of his benefits. (Wonder if those included all you can eat Hudson river fish?) He filed so many fraudulent lawsuits against the government for enforcing rules against him that GE lost its contracts with the U.S. government. Yay Lobbyist. <br>

This matters because a) she doesn't have to go through a public school board to hire a teacher, and b) that even when teachers are not paid by taxpayers there is still no surplus of them.  <br>
<br>
It also bears noting that while there may in fact be more people going to college to become teachers than lawyers, our society needs many more teachers than lawyers.  Consider just how many schools exist in this country and how many teachers it takes to operate even a small school, versus the number of law firms and the number of lawyers it takes to operate one. <p>Arikel, n00b thane of The Grey Legion <BR>

Fire fighters in this country make 2/3 of what a teacher makes IF that, maybe 1/2 in some cases.When I watch the news, I see teacher strikes every few weeks or so.It happened here 2 years ago.<br>
<br>
IMO,Teachers make okay money, enough to get by,but they also complain about not being paid enough.Fire fighting is a more rigorous job,get paid less,yet, most do not complain.Why you may ask?Because the men and women love their jobs and what they do.If you truly love your job, ANY money you make should be a bonus (After the amount you have to get by in life).<br>

We need more Democrats in office, they are faultless.<br>
<br>
<br>
In other news, teachers in the northeast who have 15 children are considered in poverty and qualify for welfare....proof positive that teachers are underpaid.<br>
<br>
In most places there are generally only shortages of teachers in specific (science and math) areas.  That's because it takes a person with half a brain to teach those subjects and teachers with half a brain are rather scarce.<br>
<br>
My father was a teacher, my sister is a teacher, my wife was a speech pathologist in the school systems.  MOST teachers do not complain about the pay because they work, on average, every other day and get full benefits and their schedules coincide with the schedules of their children.  That's one of the main reasons people take the job.  The biggest problem teachers have are liberals who screw up the system with indoctrination programs and who tie their hands from teaching those that will learn by burdening them with those that refuse to learn.<br>
<br>
Oh, and I'm a lawyer...yes we should get rid of half of them (but not the half that I'm in <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ) because the majority of them are liberals and I don't like sharing the business.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

And the reason we have so many lawyers and lawsuits is there are too many people looking for a free ride (like some people posting to this thread) and always wanna sue to get some money or sue to keep those damn Republicans from using their land as they see fit.<br>
<br>
The Superfund is a tremendous waste of other people's money.

<br>
You say that they qualify for food stamps and that is 'nuff said...but it is not.  Tell the whole story.  Are you talking about a substitute teacher (who only needs a high school diploma) who works two days out of the week?  Are you talking about a teacher with 15 kids?  <br>
<br>
If you wanna talk about baseless arguments...give all the facts.  Your made up hypotheticals have no more credibility than mine.  That is the point.  Yet you are so quick to pat each other on the back when your made up stories point out something you believe is true.<br>
<br>
Why is it pin heads who think they know everything love to call people less intelligent?  Is that your rebuttal, that I do not sound intelligent when I point out your charade?  Grow up.  <br>

<br>
Where did she post the number of children they had?  Or what their wages were?  Does Northampton give food stamps to families of 4 who earn less than $25,000 per year?<br>
<br>
You can give food stamps to millionaires and it does not mean that they are underpaid.<br>
<br>
&quot;3. I do think some professions are underpaid, yes. &quot;Teacher&quot; comes immediately to mind. These men and women spend day in and day out trying to expand the minds and opportunities of children for so little pay that many of them are on food stamps. (Especially those in the public school system.) Yet they continue to do it. I think they deserve more money -- if teaching paid more, we wouldn't have the dearth of teachers we do now. Overworked and underpaid, but I guess there must be some reason they do it....&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Heh, I must have missed a post because I sure can't find where it was clear that this was talking bout full time teachers with 0-3 children, I guess I did need the clarification. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

As for sounding less intelligent, how about:<br>
<br>
&quot;The poor do not choose to be poor. I am poor.&quot;<br>
<br>
Here she leads us to believe she is going to give us her story about how she is poor and it has nothing to do with her choices...<br>
<br>
&quot;My total salary for the past tax year was under $4000.&quot; <br>
<br>
Well, so much for that idea, you are not working full time and earning $4,000 per year.  Therefore she is chosing to work less and remain poor.<br>
<br>
&quot;Although I am not on welfare, many of the working poor need the help.&quot;<br>
<br>
Ok, what does your situation have to do with anything then?  I like cheese, and although many people don't like cheese, we should all send $10 to the World Wildlife Federation because their $3 billion in assets must grow so long as there are still some people out there who think that they should be able to cut down trees......   /boggle<br>

Kudos to Sage for at least getting Chi to admit that he was totally misphrasing the issue and that it really came down to regular taxes or other companies paying for unfunded cleanups.

I'd say that calling &quot;the rest of the liberals&quot; liars when you know that some of the people you are discussing this with are liberals qualifies as a personal attack.  I am a liberal, and you state that &quot;the rest of the liberals&quot; lie.  Thus you are calling me a liar.

More good stuff.  Totally patronizing and dismissive.  You come off as a total @#%$, why should you be treated as anything else?  Sure... it's rants and flames, and you are free to post pretty much anything you want.  We in turn are free to laugh at you and think that you are a tool.  I'll disregard anything after this, since Ritt and I did trash you after this point.  I'll also disregard absurd statements about the purpose of corporations (it's to make more money, you friggin' boob, not to provide jobs), since you are after all entitled to your opinion on the situation.<br>
<br>
I suppose you could argue that Chiteng's attacks on Bush could be construed as attacks on republicans in general, but even if this were the case I think you've been reading here long enough to know that Chiteng only represents himself.<br>

Liberals are morons.<br>
<br>
That is not a personal attack, because it was not aimed at you PERSONALLY.  Just because you ARE a moronic liberal and you take it personally doesn't make it a personal attack on you.<br>
<br>
You and Ritt (as typical liberals) must get along great.  You both seem to love to make up stuff to respond to.  Where did I ever ask &quot;Why aren't you taking me seriously and treating me with respect?&quot;<br>
<br>
You have a greatly exagerated sense of your own worth.  (that is a personal observation/attack)  I could not care less whether you take me seriously or treat me with respect.  I am not conversing with you to try to convince you of anything.  Everyone knows that liberals are too narrow minded to change their views on any topic.  <br>
<br>
I just do this for amusement.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->     <br>
<br>
So you guys can continue to pat each other on the back and say &quot;now people at least people know the issues&quot; and think you did some &quot;good&quot; by spouting your propaganda here, but in reality you have done nothing.  <br>
<br>
And exactly what exactly do you think you trashed me on?  Do you honestly believe that anyone other than your fellow hard-core liberals took anything you and Ritt said as the truth?  Again, you really have an exagerated sense of your own self worth.<br>
<br>
