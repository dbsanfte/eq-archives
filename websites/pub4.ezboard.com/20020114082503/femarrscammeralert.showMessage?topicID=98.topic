My enchanter is Chamcham, of Champions of Marr as am I.<br>
<br>
What happened was, we saw Widdel loot the Cobalt Gauntlets.  He then said &quot;Should we random them?&quot;  We had a short group discussion over them, and then he said &quot;Well I have a high level warrior with shitty equipment.&quot;  a few moments later after we were concluding that Breadly, the warrior in the group, should get them, he went LD and didn't come back.  I asked the zone if anyone had any interactions with this character, and only one person sent me a tell.  Some guy called Bashyur sent me a tell and said the helped him out, then he asked me how much the Cobalt Gauntlets were worth.  I thought &quot;This ought to be the same guy, I'm not responding to *that*.&quot;<br>
<br>
A couple of hours later, I had to leave the group, so the whole group left as well (Curses to Lgurorm for the trains and stupidity when Cobalt Gauntlets were mentioned, that must have been his warrior).  Then it so happened that Widdel logged on again the moment we left.  He denied that he had even looted the gauntlets, but since someone said they have a screen shot of that, we can prove him wrong.<br>
<br>
We were in the middle of talking with a GM in the Cappy Room when Lgurorm, or how ever his name is spelled, came in and hanged around and wouldn't leave, like a dirty scar if you ask me.  Then a train came up soon after and our GM conversation was interrupted.  So I don't know what the GMs think of this yet, but I haven't seen the druid around since.  The only person close to Widdel on the server I've seen on /who all has been a character called Widdil (he's on anonymous, in Chain of Honor)<br>
<br>
Well, this concludes my report on Widdel.  Good journies.<br>

<br>
I'm sure I saw a post from someone stating they had a screenshot of Widdel looting the gloves.  I don't, but I'll go around asking who I can remember was in the group.  The names I remember in the group as of today (some names faded away, curse my old, err, young age) are Chamcham (myself), Breadly, and Branigan.  I think maybe Arctic was there as well as the shaman, but maybe that was another group experience.  Oh well, maybe Branigan has the picture, I'll go ask him some time.  We had a monk, too, but I can't remember her name anymore.<br>
<br>
To correct myself on my first post as well, the shaman wasn't &quot;Bashyur&quot; who was asking me how much the gauntlets were worth, it was &quot;Bashyum&quot;.  I have no real way of proving Lgorurm and/or Bashyum are Widdel, I just figure it was suspiscous and they might be one in the same after the chain of events had occured.  But I'd bang my head upon a metal pole a thousand times and many more if I were wrong for both names.<br>
<br>
But until next time...<br>

As guild leader of the Lgurorms previous guild I was the one who invited him and his twinks to my guild. To my knowledge Lugrorm is the kids higest character and all his other twinks are lower in lvl. If widdel was a friend of his I do not know. I do however know that if he heard Cobalt mentioned he proably hung on everyword, he really wants some for his warrior as does every warrior. He is a younger player and as with my experience with younger players not always aware that you can't go around bugging people for items. He was proably curious however he left my guild for Chain of Honor and if that is where widdel is, anything is possible.<br>

<br>
Yes, I was in the group at the time and I remember things pretty much as you describe them.  I think Widdel was a little more blatant in his desire to keep the gauntlets for himself than you say, but that's just semantics.<br>
<br>
Anyway, in later conversation with Breadly (the group warrior who was there), it turned out that MC did indeed give him a pair of gauntlets which was a very nice gesture <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I have no idea what became of our /petition on Widdel, as I have not been contacted on the issue since it happened.<br>
<br>
And I dont have any idea what the deal with Lgurorm was.  I think it was completely unrelated/bad timing/bad luck for him to be training us while we were trying to talk with the GM.  I prefer to think of it as an accident.  At least that was my impression.  <br>
<br>
Widdel, on the other hand, can go back to the feces filled hole he crawled out of.<br>

I'll put him on my friend's list and keep a close eye out for him, but I hope he didn't get away with those gaunts, if he were to sell them or even if he did have his own high level warrior with crappy equipment.  I didn't think I'd ever run into a ninja looter who's played for over 50 levels, but I guess maybe he was a soloer for life and didn't know any better.<br>
