(nt)</span><hr size=1> Maeri :<br>
&quot;Anyone want to make a guess as to the ratio of innocent civilians deaths due to American bombs in Afghanistan vs those that died on Sept 11?&quot;<br>
<br>
Frankly Maeri, I don't think anyone cares a whole lot, and I don't think you're comments really say anything useful.<br>
<br>
Bin Laden is not only responsible for Sept 11, he is responsible for the Cole bombing that killed 19, Bombings of embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998 that killed over 200, and the 1993 WTC bombing.  He is likely also responsible for the recent Anthrax attacks in the US.<br>
<br>
These are just the successful actions.  The CIA has reported that a number of other attempts have been thwarted, the ones they gave details of :<br>
<br>
&quot;Among operations believed to have been thwarted: a planned attack on U.S. facilities in London early this year and an attack on FBI headquarters in Washington this past summer.&quot;<br>
<br>
Now, 9 years after his first attack on the US, 9 years of sitting on our duffs being pacifists like you advocate, Bin Laden made a decisive victory against the US on US soil.  He destroyed the 2 tallest buildings on US soil, killed nearly 6000 people, and wrecked what was probably the most important financial center of the western world.<br>
<br>
Frankly, world wars have been fought over far less than this.  It is not a question of attrition as you so mind numbingly state, it is a question of survivial.  It's only a matter of time before he does something really bad - as if this wasnt bad enough.<br>
<br>
Picture it, 10 years from now, a half dozen other major terrorist actions in the US have come and gone, and a small nuke goes off in NYC.  Then another in Washington.  And another in LA, and one in Dalls.  That's a very real possibility.  <br>
<br>
Or maybe it would be more gruesome and slow.  Maybe he manages to infect the water supply of a few blocks of NYC with Ebola.  If he hit the right areas, and several highly populated cities, he could kill millions just as if he had dropped an h-bomb.  <br>
<br>
You think this is stupid?  Experience is a great teacher.  Hopefully Americans will not listen to people like you, so that just maybe we can eliminate this threat before it becomes far greater than it is now.<br>
<br>
So, in short, war is hell.  We are fighting to destroy someone who has proven that they have the means, the will, and the patience to do whatever it takes to kill us.  In laymans terms, its him and his people or us and ours.  I choose us.  <br>
<br>
It sounds a bit like you have chosen him.<br>
<br>
We have a right to defend ourselves.  In the full light of the history of Bin Laden and his allies, the attrition numbers you speak of dont really mean squat.  <br>

What you say is right! Any one has the right to himself, his home, his security.<br>
<br>
How they do it, is a different matter.<br>
<br>
The world dislike how the US 'defends' itself.<br>
<br>
Read the above posts about how 'effective' those air strikes are. <br>
<br>
Many innocents dead, homes destroyed etc. While the true 'targets' are alive and well, and are prolly planning for more. Talk about futile ( so far ) actions.<br>
<br>
The world is angry at the none-challance in describing those deaths 'Collateral damage' with the attached 'sorry'.<br>
<br>
Btw, the tanks they had are pieces of junk, nothing in comparison with the US technology...or wait, aren't surgical strikes not so surgical anymore...?<br>

Ermm... did I say doing nothing was the right action? Actually, I suspect it would be a lot more sucessful than either the current military action, or what's been done for the last 50 years. As for no reactions at all: 2 car bombs in Africa. Response? 26 (I think) cruise missiles. Effectiveness? Several civilian deaths, destroyed a medical facility, probably helped bin Laden find more recruits.<br>
<br>
As to your horror stories from 10 years from now, my main concern is that I don't believe current actions will prevent those possibilities. That's even if bin Laden is captured and the Taliban deposed. I'm afraid that it may make those kinds of events even more likely.<br>
Solathan. Where was your TV made? I suspect most TVs outside the US (and probably a lot inside) were made in Japan or South East Asia.<br>
<br>
Kytherion:<br>
&gt;  You've accused American civilians of valuing their own lives ahead of those of Afghan citizens. That<br>
&gt; strikes me as odd, since the Afghanis have done exactly the same thing.<br>
Indeed they have. It's one of the terribly ugly things about humans that civilization seems to have failed to overcome, and this tribalism has lead to a huge number of attrocities.   Your examples are a little skewed however. The afghani farmer may not be overthrowing the relatively well armed Taliban with his pitchfork (a much superior weapon to anything the US commandos have), but he's not actively supporting their actions like the Japanese monks or German mother. Those who try to organise and overthrow the Taliban aren't going to be able to keep the farm and feed their family for long. Unlike the US, Afghanistan does not claim to be a democracy where the majority of citizens have a say in the actions of the government.<br>

<br>
The obvious answer is because the arguments are not actually straightforward and undeniably right. In fact, the issues at stake in the war against terrorism are so complex, so debateable and so open to interpretation that it is probably beyond any of us to sum it all up in any meaningful way.<br>

<br>
To address your issue of effectiveness I believe that you have to look at a larger picture. You are probably correct in that this current campaign will not wipe terrorism from the globe. However, if done right it has the potential to set large scale terrorist actions back a while. Something like the sept 11th attacks require large sums of resources in the form of money, intelligence, training and men. If those resources are depleted then the chances of something like that happening again become very unlikely. Will those resources ever be available again in the future? Maybe. We all hope not though. Even if Osama and a majority of his Al Qeada network are brought to justice peaceably, without the destruction of the other resources we still position ourselves to have something like this happen again.<br>
<br>
As to the issue of tribalism, I think that its a good thing. Issues of the individual are addressed better when a small local ruling body is right there to experience those issues and make decisions to resolve them. And I think that when individuals are happy then everyone is happy. I did a paper on this relating to the American civil war in college. Turned out to be an enlightening experience and actually helped shape my political views concerning world government and what not. <br>
<br>
As to the issue of the cluster bomb, saying it was a mistake to use it because its not a &quot;smart&quot; weapon is kinda missing the picture here, especially when examining the target. The most effective way to destroy and airstrip is to fill it full of hundreds of holes instead of one big hole and at the same time maybe destroying some facilities in the process.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uwarangel1.showPublicProfile?language=EN>WarAngel1</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 43<br> <font color=#E9D756>(10/30/01 8:41:19 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=214.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Bombs are falling on Afghanistan.

 Ermm... did I say doing nothing was the right action?&quot;<br>
<br>
 It didn't look to me like you suggested much of anything, which is why I said I didn't think anyone cared about someone whining of 'collateral damage' victims.<br>
<br>
Your suggestions about CIA operations and special forces actions have already been tried, some of the facts about that are seeping out now (ie Clinton tried).  <br>
<br>
The simple fact is that it didnt work.<br>
<br>
&quot;Actually, I suspect it [doing nothing] would be a lot more sucessful than either the current military action&quot;<br>
<br>
I think the results of being passive, ie Sept 11th, solidly prove that hypothesis wrong.<br>
<br>
&quot;or what's been done for the last 50 years.&quot;<br>
<br>
If the USA hadn't done what it has done for the past 50 years, you most likely would be a communist and would risk execution or imprisonment for posting on a board like this.  Actually, forums  like this probably wouldn't exist at all, and/or accessing them would likely be illegal.<br>
<br>
Yeah, we really screwed up protecting your freedom. <br>
<br>
&quot;As for no reactions at all: 2 car bombs in Africa. Response? 26 (I think) cruise missiles. Effectiveness? Several civilian deaths, destroyed a medical facility, probably helped bin Laden find more recruits.&quot;<br>
<br>
At the time that happened, I thought it was a dumb move.  The US govornment said that it was a bio weapons facility.  <br>
In retrospect, it is looking like the govornment was right, or at least had some kind of knowledge that Bin Laden was making bio weapons.  Ever wonder if there is a link between Bin Ladens bio weapon facility we destroyed in Africa and the Anthrax here in the USA?    <br>
<br>
Actually I suppose you dont wonder.  Sounds to me like you are in the anti-american crowd overseas. <br>
<br>
All this aside, I like things to be clear.  Personally, I would just assume we didn't have troops anywhere in the world outside our borders.  Let North Korea annex South Korea, let Milosovich start another European war, let China invade Taiwan, let Iraq conqure half the middle east.  And when people over there whine about lack of support, we can just quote opinion polls and politicians that share your views about what we should and shouldn't do.<br>
<br>
Frankly, I don't think its any of our concern what the fucked up other side of the globe does to itself as long as it doesnt spew over into North America.  People in europe, asia, the middle east, and Africa have been killing each other for centuries, millenia even.  The problem is that the USA was effectively forced into 2 world wars that originated in Europe and Asia.  We didn't do anything until we were attacked.  Those wars are what really got us into the police the world role anyway, since every other country had beat the living shit out of each other.<br>
<br>
So, you bet im an isolationist.  But that doesn't change my view that we have to defend ourselves.  If the road ahead according to the govornment is to exterminate the threat, no matter what the cost, then so be it.  We can talk about isolationism after Bin Laden and his cronies are dead.<br>
