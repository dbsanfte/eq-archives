So I will repost it  UNanonymously)<br><br><br>I swore I would never put someone here.. I like to think i am a forgiving person. but what this person did bothered me.. and almost an entire zone of people.. so much that I thought I would warn others of him.<br><br>It started out a couple days ago when I had just got into a group to kill Gobs in HK. I came in in the middle of a conversation and being the nosey person I am asked what they where talking about. They sadi this guy (Kalvatros) was standing around and waiting for the group to get mobbed so he could loot kills while they where in the middle of a battle. Not sure what else happened I wasn't there but they all had him on ignore so I figure he did a little more then that.<br><br>Well today I was once again grouped in HK and some bronze dropped. SO as is done we rolled for it. Kalvatrose proceed to spam with rolls for 5 minutes or so. Our grouped asked him to please stop. He didnt. Everytime we rolled he did the same thing. The he proceeded to stand at teh entrance of the room and wait till our enchanter mezzed. Then he would run in and break the mezz (which the first time he did it he broke mez on 5 or them.. obviously doing it to be an ass). He continued to do this for about 30 minutes before he trained onto a lower level group and getting them killed. He did this a few times before leaving the zone. During this time of course you have sthings said in channel to him. We (my group) and the other groups in the zone ask him nicely to stop... it became clear that he wasnt going to as he insulted and esentially acted like a child with everyone in the zone. He was reported/petitioned by no less then 6 people (and no the weren't all in my group).<br><br>GMs got back to us but Kalvatros had apparently left... so I thought.. seconds later he showed back up and annouced his presence by running down.. grabbing a train.. and running it into the groups there. Coming back for more he ran into the room we were in and began to break mezzes AGAIN... forcing our enchanter to zone because the immediatly aggroed her. Little did he know he was being watched. The problem was resolved but I do feel that he warrants watching. By his behavior tonight and by his obvious history of this type of actions.<br><br> <p><center><img src="http://www.geocities.com/ghostmaiden77/DK.jpg"><p>Dreamia Nitemare<br>Level 33 ShadowKnight</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uhsianlichen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Hsian Li Chen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><FONT COLOR=AA0000><B>Lanys.com Moderator</B></FONT></span><br> <font color=#000033>(12/28/00 3:57:51 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://hsian-li.tripod.com/webme.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Re - Kalvatros</span><hr size=1> He did this a couple of weeks ago when I was also in a group in HK down in the warrior room. <br><br>- posted by Aniiena in another locked thread<br><br>xianmonkie<br> <p><table width="550" border="0" align="center">  <tr>     <td width="550">       <div align="center">         <p><img src="http://hsian-li.tripod.com/xianwifey.gif"><br>          "Yes, I solo a lot.

I've also had some bad experiences with him while playing my twinks, indeed I was playing the group cleric, as well as being the group leader, when the the thing described by Dreamia went down. And yes, there was indeed more to it than a few ninja-looted goblins (hell, not like they drop anything worthwhile anyway, not for a mostly twink group at least <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ). <br><br>Lets just say it was enough that I have his name written down on a piece of paper taped onto the front of my computer screen, and that he is the only name on my ignore list. And there to stay. Usally I would not have him on ignore as that would also kill any train warnings, but two reasons he is still there: I sincerely doubt he would issue a warning anyway, and he is too low himself to survive training things that can reliably kill me <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br>I've also seen him a few times after that, latest trying to get a GM to make the guard room group in HK share the spawn, none of which he would have any chance of soloing anyway. Of course, he did train them some to make the point, before he called the GM. Seems that most of the people who frequent HK know of him by now, as the ooc conversation rapidly picked up about him. But I am not one to convey incidents I have not witnessed, so i'll leave it at that.<br><br>Dang, this is the first time I responded seriously to a shitlist post, and I don't really like it.
