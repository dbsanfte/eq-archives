Far from it pal.  The people who I'm referring to read this message board and have every bit of free will to reveal themselves if they so choose.  However, since I don't believe in throwing names out there only for you to stalk them in tells, I'm not going to give you the satisfaction.  (Yes, Sage and I both loved your tell stalking while we were trying to lead Hate.  I had a good laugh when Sage informed me you kept switching characters to avoid his ignore list.)<br>
<br>
Visnet, like I said, I wasn't there and if he honestly didn't scam anyone that day, then that's a miracle and I suppose there's a first time for everything.  My beef is not with you and I don't wish to start one.  Sage's advice is good sound advice .. Valric is lower than Mumaden, Airaman, Scootie and every other scammer that is listed on this forum ten times over.  However, like I've stated, reliable people in my opinion, told me these tales and while it is second hand information, they all basically told the same story.  What was fishy exactly?  I don't know, I didn't ask.  If they want to reveal their side of it, I'm sure they will.<br>

<br>
How do you define stalking as asking you one night why the hell you are lieing. Which all you could reply is, 'I don't want to deal with that now. It's not important.' Stalking is a repeated offense of hounding or following. 5 minutes out of one night is not stalking. Well, for you Tormentcia it's more like having &quot;/who all Valric&quot; hotkeyed so you can see where I am, and who I'm with every second. Understand?<br>
<br>
So if you want to fabricate more stories to make you look so good and hurt my rep worse go for it. It will just go to show who the real people are here. <br>
<br>
The question is not if you hate me. It's a matter of morality. Are you just going to listen to people who blindly make accusations just because they want to? Or are you going to listen to what you should, and that's yourself. Stop and think about what's being said, and the proof. <br>
<br>
As for me being the second Valric, your right. I have no reason to prove I am to you. But I am. Yeah, you may come back with some witty response about my credibility, but it's up to you to believe what you want. Don't judge me over stuff that's heard. Judge me over what you see, I could really care less at this point, just wanted to get that off my chest.<br>
<br>
Going to post the time lime of when I came on playing Valric and the events which all took place. Short explanation of each as well.<br>
<br>
Oh, and here's what Tormentcia's next responce will be...<br>
<br>
Valric, you need to get a clue you loser. No one likes you, cuase your a scammer, and shanny raid leader, and I say so. You suck at leadings raids, and are fishy, I got proof too. I have some friends who all told me this, and they are very good people, and you all should believe me. I won't give names again because Valric might say something.<br>

Chain of Honor knows the situation, doesn't care. Do PoH raids, have a blast.<br>
<br>
lvl 50-51, go hog wild, buy full set of rubicite because I can, trade to a druid for his gear and give out on a Renux raid to the people who helped. Roggo and Valric&lt;me&gt; kill General twice with help from Sagemon and others. My attempt is almost lost as a certain cleric suddenly lagged and people started dieing, it happens, pets and two melee kill General at last possible second. Valric&lt;me&gt; gets kedge chained from Rarebird for 10k that night and turns in epic. I screwed up and forgot to give the jagged diamond dagger and was sooo mad at myself. Guild says to just give the dagger now, I do and recieve the Ragebringer!<br>
<br>
Somewhere in lvl 52 original Valric gets on and goes to freeport and plays around with Mastello, his friend. loses a duel to a monk and gets all upset and harrasses the monk and Vishanti's group of friends.<br>
<br>
lvl 52, lead a CoH/pick up PoH raid, go to get the stones, and come back to find 60 people there with Sagemon /telling me this is ridiculous, Gorndax told him to leave and he wasn't staying. Get back with stones, try to find what's going on, and am told to stfu by guildmembers and just go up with Gorndax. Lo and behold, they are the ones left out as Ishial, some others CoH and Sagemon get to go up. But are told it was because I said they couldn't come. Raid continues while Valric and Gorn discuss, brought to OOC and hell ensues. Raid continues, all leave. CoH stay up, I fall asleep and get corpse in the morning. I still laugh about this because at 7 am I wake up with a guide sitting there waiting for the last 3 and a half hours for a GM to log on to world kick me. I thank him and log off.<br>
<br>
lvl 53, billing gets shut off and I pick up the cycle with my credit card. After all the flack from his events, I decided best to turn it off, he screwed it up, I pay for it now. My money, my game now.<br>
<br>
lvl 53-55 lead a few PoG raids, and kael raids. PoG was basically Maeralle's with me slightly assisting her. Hook up a friend 60 rogue with getting his epic from General, get there, is a guild trying to kill general, like 1 cleric, and all 52 and under. Offer to team up and do both, they agree. 30 mins later while heading to cabin, find out MS is doing Renux now for another rogue. Wait on MS to get here and move to RV, take out some dark elfs, small no name guild begins slandering MS because they did not get to loot the dark elfs, argueing continues, pull anotehr de, then small guild leaves, MS/Valric and Kaluminatie group continue and kill 3 generals getting 3 rogues their epic. Thank everyone and go turn in Kal's crap and get his epic later that night.<br>
<br>
lvl 56, Sagemon and Tormentcia tag team slamming me for no apparent reason, lead a PoG raid, bring up a few ideas, still the slamming. Life goes on...<br>
<br>
There's what happened, whether you believe it or not, that is it right there.<br>
<br>
Now for the Sagemon/Tormentcia issue all I can figure out is because of Darmu's PoG raid which I went on. Come to find out Sagemon had one planned for the next day and no one knew, Sagemon told Darmu but he wouldn't step down. Darmu tells me we need clerics. I ask Sagemon and he doesn't seem pleased. I tell Darmu at the same time I'm saking Sagemon, and he laughs and says no, he's sorta pissed because he thinks I ruined his raid. I left it at that and dropped talking to Sagemon.<br>
<br>
Now I still don't know why that would cause SAgemon and his girlfriend to harrass me, but oh well. All I have to say is Sagemon, if you think I was intentionally making fun of you, mocking you what ever, sorry bro. I seriously didn't know. But seriously, why the hell are you doing this now all of a sudden?<br>

Not 'all' apparently, Visnet and Kieara had no probs with him =)<br>
<br>
Torm, why do you feel obligated to come and slam someone with second hand information? Why do you complain about how Valric leads his raids? Noone is forcing you to participate in em, so whats the problem? <br>
<br>
Personaly, I have read and heard a lot of shit about Valric. It's hardly ever backed with any real proof, just someones assumption of a situtation, or hearing it from a friends dogs cousins uncles mothers neighbor who knows a man who knows a man , blah blah.<br>
<br>
I've done several kael arena runs with Valric, along with a few pick-up raids and I've never had any problems with him. I know people who have raided with em and never had a single complaint. <br>
It seems almost like your tryin to turn Valric into Ghalewind_02, and get everyone riding him. Fortunately Valric knows how to type a paragraph without saying 'fuck' every other word, so he can defend himself.<br>
Course I could be wrong and he could just have a huge skeleton in his closset that he's managed to conceal =d<br>
<br>
anywhoot, im phasin out =d <br>

Does anyone really believe that one tool could garner so much animosity from people if he did nothing? Are you really that naive? <br>
<br>
I love his little timeline of how Valric 1.0 became Valric 2.0......thats a fucking classic. Not much you could say good about him except he certainly knows how to formulate a good fiction piece <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
The truth behind his entire story is that Valric 1.0 realized that he's a complete ass and isnt getting ANYWHERE in this game because of that. So like all the other tools before him &quot;reinvents&quot; himself and tries to pass himself off as a &quot;new&quot; Valric. Fortunately the majority of the people who read these boards are more intelligent than Valric 1.0 whos 2.0 so his attempts fall flat...just like when the shed's door flew open and he fell out. Someone lock the shed please.<br>
<br>
For the record you will never REALLY know someone on the other side of a pixellated avatar BUT actions speak volumes in this game. <br>

...but I digress. &nbsp;You disgust me. &nbsp;The things you've said to women in my guild disgust me. &nbsp;You have no clue how to treat anyone with respect except when you have something to gain from it. &nbsp;Whether or not you are a scammer, you have proven yourself to be dishonest.<br>

Gee Valric, does that seem fabricated or like it's made up?  There's someone giving you proof right there .. oh wait, are you going to claim those screenshots were fabricated?  I'll be over here waiting for your next version of what you claim to not have done.  Nothing and I mean NOTHING that has been said about you has been false, including the tell stalking.  You seem to leave out the fact of what exactly I kept telling you.  Yes, I told you I did not have time and that I had something else more important going on .. I was leading a Hate raid.  You always seem to forget that part .. but then again, you would since it doesn't fit the &quot;poor little Valric pity party of 1&quot; scenario.<br>
<br>
Valric, I'm going to give you some honest advice, and I know you're not going to listen to it .. if anything, you'll be the jackass we all know and can't stand.  However, you need to take a hard look at your words and your actions.  You have proof staring you in the face and you know you're doing is wrong.  You need to stop, step back and start changing what you're doing and quit being Valric the Prick 3.0.  No one likes to be told negative things about themselves, and it makes it harder when you go to a game to escape from your RL reality (like I know you are) and get detested here.  The only person that can make the change that is necessary is you.  If not, this continues.  I'm not holding my breath however and I know you'll just rant on all of this because you think you have done nothing wrong.  However, look at some of that proof that Sihl just gave .. read what you're spouting.  You forget that on the other side of that computer, you're talking to a real person with real feelings.  Then again, maybe you like verbally bitch slapping people on a computer to make you feel like a man.  Who knows.  Maybe you're just mental.<br>
<br>
All I know is that all these people who strongly dislike you and your actions can't be wrong.  No one needs to throw any more proof up there.  The only thing that throwing names around would cause is you to rip on them too.  Sorry, I like my friends too much to do that to them.  I respect their privacy and that they don't want to come forward and I honor my friends wishes.  Too bad you aren't able to do the same. <p>Tormentcia

Lets see how to solve this???<br>
I know! Comedy Central, dont take your dispute to court take it to BOWLING!!<br>
I say we all bet on who wins Valric or Tormentcia!!<br>
I am betting Valric bowls just under 100 and Tormentcia bowls just under 110. *snicker*<br>

There is a rant here on the boards from it all 'vlaric you pathetic piece of shit'...<br>

I was there - in person - and all I can say is what a tool.<br>
<br>
I will never raid with him.  I will leave any raid he is on - I will try to stay out of the same zone he is in.<br>

I know many people who feel the same way, but make your own judgements... I will however stand by what *I* have personally witnessed.  <br>

Let's start with Valric's latest outburst of stupidity.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Raid continues while Valric and Gorn discuss, brought to OOC and hell ensues. Raid continues, all leave.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
For all of the detail that he provides elsewhere, Valric sure does skip over that part of the story pretty quickly.  I posted the full story on this board a few months ago in response to Gorndax's flame of Valric.  While I have criticisms of the way that Gorndax conducted himself, I have nothing but disgust for the way that Valric disrupted the raid and went on a bizarre tirade against Gorndax.  Valric acknowledged that Gorndax was calling the shots, then bitched about it all night.  When Gorndax was slow in pulling the Abhorrents (which drop the rogue armor that Valric wanted so badly), Valric exploded and instigated a pathetic pissing match that brought the raid to a screeching halt.  Valric actually said that he was just going to go pull the mobs himself if Gorndax didn't pull them.<br>
<br>
During the course of the night, Valric was also trying to persuade the members of our group to just keep some of the items that we looted and not tell Gorndax that they had dropped.  I said hell no, and so did the other members of the group, who I believe were CoH members.<br>
<br>
This guy is a total scumbag.  Ever since that raid, I have refused to have anything to do with this guy.  I don't group with people like that.  I recently found out that a druid I grouped with twice in OS -- Syano -- is also Valric.  It made me want to puke to know that I'd actually come into contact with the guy again.  That's one more name on my /ignore list.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Now for the Sagemon/Tormentcia issue all I can figure out is because of Darmu's PoG raid which I went on. Come to find out Sagemon had one planned for the next day and no one knew, Sagemon told Darmu but he wouldn't step down.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Yeah, right.  The Friday PoG raid was organized by Quis, not Darmu.  I told Quis that I was totally cool with it because we would still have all of the mobs east of the river for our Saturday raid, and that we could do repops if we had time left over.  It was a total non-issue. <br>
<br>
Our raid went just great.  Valric kept begging me to join the raid, and I brushed him off.  There was no way in hell that guy was joining our raid.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Darmu tells me we need clerics. I ask Sagemon and he doesn't seem pleased. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
No shit.  I don't like getting tells from turds.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Now I still don't know why that would cause SAgemon and his girlfriend to harrass me, but oh well. All I have to say is Sagemon, if you think I was intentionally making fun of you, mocking you what ever, sorry bro. I seriously didn't know. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Valric keeps referring to Tormentcia (who lives 1000 miles away from me with her fiance) as my girlfriend because he thinks it pisses me off.  Torm and I have been getting some good laughs out of the whole thing.<br>
<br>
Notice how Valric is looking for some explanation for my flames other than the fact that they might be deserved.  It's really sort of pathetic.<br>
<br>
Now let's turn to Harpexx.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Personaly, I have read and heard a lot of shit about Valric. It's hardly ever backed with any real proof, just someones assumption of a situtation, or hearing it from a friends dogs cousins uncles mothers neighbor who knows a man who knows a man , blah blah.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Pull your head out of your ass, Harpexx.  I observed what Valric did with my own eyes, as did a lot of other people on this board.  This is fact, not rumor. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> It seems almost like your tryin to turn Valric into Ghalewind_02, and get everyone riding him. Fortunately Valric knows how to type a paragraph without saying 'fuck' every other word, so he can defend himself.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Really?  Here's an example of Valric's elevated prose, from a thread on the Dragons and Planes board:<br>
<br>
&quot;Sagemon, your a fucking moron. M-O-R-O-N.<br>
<br>
&quot;How many times you going to mix up the events? Maybe your not moxing them up, perhaps just purposely distorting them because your a dick.<br>
<br>
&quot;I am the one who was at the hate raid who got in an arguement with Gorndax. I wasn't the one who did that to Vishanti. I am the one who got the epic. So, you can basically kiss my ass and go ahead spouting your bullshit stories bro.&quot;<br>
<br>
As for Ghalewind, I don't know him (or her), so I can't comment.  If he's as big a dirtbag as Valric, that would be an impressive feat.<br>
<br>
Next came this gem from Visnet.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Sheesh! I dont even know the guy but if I will let someone be damned for something they didnt do and I know it you may as well damn me too!<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Really?  You know that Valric didn't do all of those things?  I'd like to hear more about that.  I don't remember your name coming up in any of the prior threads about the stuff that Valric has done.  Did those two blue bubbles of experience during the PoG raid give you some deeper insight?  Or did Valric just promise you a BD?<br>
<br>
It's fascinating that Valric, of all people, would seek to portray himself as a victim.  Not very many people are going to buy that one. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/utormentcia.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tormentcia</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 169<br> <font color=#E9D756>(8/14/01 1:44:27 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Odd, or No?</span><hr size=1> Sage, that's nut hugging girlfriend I believe <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>Tormentcia
