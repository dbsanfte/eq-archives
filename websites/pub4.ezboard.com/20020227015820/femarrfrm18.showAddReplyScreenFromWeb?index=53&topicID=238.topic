<br>
This will not be a flame war. I guarantee it. Thank you for responding you made some good points. I want to say that it is also rude that Congress could ask a President if they had felatio performed on them in the privacy of their home or office. Don't you? I think Congressmen who asks such questions are being purposefully rude. Just as I baited you, they baited Clinton. Pause and think about how you felt at reading my questions, now think why we should allow a public figure to be humiliated publicly like Clinton was. I don't think it is right. My apologies for being so rude. I wanted to drive a stake into the heart of the matter for clarity.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> &quot;This is NOT true Lurikeen. Clinton did NOT have to lie. He chose to lie. It may be justifyable or not depending on your view, but he still lied.&quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Ok... we are going to disagree here. I think he had no choice. I think he and his staff of lawyers knew he would be baited just as I baited you. Guess what, he was. The world is not comprised of people who see &quot;right and wrong&quot; as being as clear cut as you see it, Lukaria. Most people are pragmatists and think the ends justify the means. Furthermore there is a principle here worth supporting. Namely, why should our President ought to divuldge private affairs before a congressional hearing? Monica never came forward and pressed charges. So why even ask? This was dirty politics from the beginning and Clinton had every right to lie in my opinion and it was good that he lied. I would have, too.<br>
<br>

I beg to differ. You were so angry at my questions you chose to ignore the post. You wouldn't answer the questions at all, IMO.<br>

<br>
That is not true, Lukaria. You may be ignoring human nature for a more grandiose vision of morality than what is actually attainable. Ideally you may be correct, but realistically everyone is going to lie about something as insignificant as a blow job. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> &quot;Moving on, I don't see how I am a fundamentalist or how I am a black/white person when it comes to moral issues.

<br>
No, &quot;black/white&quot; reasoning is not taking a stand on something one believes in. Black and White reasoning is saying things like &quot;Lies are always wrong no matter what&quot;. Is it wrong for me to lie to a killer who enters my house and I tell them that my children are with the grandparents knowing that my silence would force a search of the house? Truly, Lukaria, such a lie on my part is actually GOOD and not morally blameworthy, now isn't it?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> &quot;It is WRONG to lie.&quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
That is the fundamentalism I am talking about. The inability to see that sometimes a lie is not morally blameworthy and hence GOOD. See the above and explain to me how that lying to a killer to save the life of my children is morally wrong. Please, just don't say &quot;It is wrong&quot;. Tell me WHY. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
Ah, the old &quot;Camel's Nose in the Tent&quot; argument. If the Camel puts its nose into the tent then you wind up with the whole Camel in the tent eventually. The fallacy is thinking that if unless everything is black and white then there is no morality at all. I would certainly not provide the same punishments to all law breakers and I certainly don't provide the same type of praise to all those who do good deeds. Why do you think that justifying moral actions leads to acts such as killing Grandma? It is like those who think that smoking marijuana leads to shooting up heroin. I know people who have smoked pot for years and never drank alcohol let alone shoot up! See, we are back to your black/white reasoning. A prime example.<br>
<br>

Hmmm... perhaps you misworded your question? Looks very black and white. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Again, you betray the fundy thinking you carry around. Telling Grandma that she looks good when you know she is an ugly fat person is a &quot;good&quot; lie. Telling the police you had nothing to drink when pulled over for a DWI is a &quot;bad&quot; lie. Why? Because of the effect of the lie. Yes, sooner or later we get caught telling lies. Grandma knows she is an ugly wench so will never want to catch grandchildren lying. She winks at the lie. The police want to catch you lying if you are driving drunk and get caught and lie. They jail you with your lie. See the difference? There is no reward to telling dangerous (bad) lies. That is, there is no moral good that results let alone any good. Lies that can be morally justified are lies that can and should be told. If my daughter could morally justify why lying to me about having sex at age 13 is OK then more power to her. I would let her know that I failed as a parent to discuss with her why she can talk to me about sex. More importantly, did I ever talk to her about sex. The question is then why did she lie? <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> &quot;If all you teach are situational ethics, then how do you teach the difference between right and wrong? What do you base it on?&quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
An excellent question, Lukaria! I really mean that. =)<br>
<br>
I teach my children that you can weigh the difference between right and wrong based on the effects actions have on others. For example, (and I use the example with my children) if one walks out into the street and smacks down a bystander they are doing something wrong. However, if the bystander asks to be smacked down (since they love pain) and you consent to it, then by all means take liberty at inflicting pain if so inclined. Indeed, I think some have &quot;rough sex&quot; and enjoy it.<br>
<br>
The point is that rational creature have the capacity to judge what effects there actions have against a scale of what is morally permissable. I teach my children that the &quot;laws of the land&quot; is the outline of the scale and fill in the &quot;gaps&quot; with my family's traditions. It is late so I will leave this here. Please do offer ideas about my thoughts. I welcome them. =)<br>

<br>
I am too tired to reply atm except for one thing - <br>
<br>
I think the main difference here Lurikeen is that I have a moral standard in which I believe and one which i strive to adhere to.  I feel certain things are morally wrong because of the effect they have upon each of us as people, on our relationships, on the world, and on our spirit.  Committing these moral wrongs may be justified in cases, and the temporary result of them may indeed be &quot;good.&quot;  I stated this before again and again, but you chose to ignore this.  <br>
<br>
You still miss the point.    <br>
<br>
Absolutely, I feel that lying is morally wrong.  In all cases.  However, if you are asking would I lie to protect the life of my child - yes of course I would. It would still be a lie, and morally, be wrong, but I would choose to lie yes.  Choosing it in order to have a good result does not change the nature of the moral - I believe it is morally wrong to lie.  Period.  <br>
<br>
It is idealistic, of course we all will still lie, but if we have no ideal or moral that we shouldn't lie, then where do we lower our standards to?<br>
<br>
Do you now understand?<br>
<br>
We are talking about two choices in how you live your life really.  Do you have a moral standard and follow it, or do you allow popular trends to dictate right and wrong?  I am not talking laws I am saying popular thought (you know like mini skirts - here today gone tomorrow).<br>
<br>
Last point to make tonight - you took my Clinton statement out of context.  Go back and reread it.  In context, you will see that when I state I would answer the questions if asked, I was referring to a congressional hearing.  Not a public message board.  I never stated I liked the fact that Clinton was asked these questions, in fact I stated the contrary.  I also feel it was dirty politics.  If you read carefully, you will see that.  What I argued was the point that lying is wrong and he did not HAVE to lie.  You disagree with that, fine.  you think the situation forced him to lie, fine.  I don't agree.  Yay, we are all happy to disagree, whoopee, move on.  Your point is not valid Lurikeen about my not answering your personal, rude questions.  I am not the President, and you are not part of a congressional hearing.  Choosing not to answer you is not an indication that I couldn't handle it, its an answer in and of itself Lurikeen.  I will not answer those questions in this forum.  Take me to court and i'll answer if asked and if I swore to tell the truth.  <br>
<br>
You should definitely see the difference here.<br>
<br>
More some other time if I feel like it.  Personally, I think we've exhausted the conversation.  You've stated what you believe and Ive stated mine.  Mine may be stricter or more idealistic, but its no less valid than yours.<br>

<br>
First, I agree with the statement &quot;...certain things are morally wrong because of the effect they have upon each of us....&quot; I think I had stated as much early on.<br>
<br>
I believe that we disagree on what constitutes a &quot;moral&quot;. I think a &quot;moral&quot; is a principle relating to a set of principles, values, and virtues; a.k.a. a system of Ethics. I see our disagreement turning on a perception of what each other's system of ethics may look like. Here is an example:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> &quot;We are talking about two choices in how you live your life really.

<br>
I believe you think that because I am an atheist I do not follow a &quot;moral standard&quot;, that some how I just follow &quot;popular thought&quot;. Of course, I don't know what you mean by &quot;moral standard&quot; so I think that you are following a system of ethics based upon a literal interpretation of the Bible. I think somewhere in &quot;there&quot; is a source of confusion and we are not really seeing what the other is saying. So let me work from my assumptions for the moment... <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>

<br>
Your point is well taken. Under oath you are saying that you would in fact answer the question. I believe we are talking past each other on this point after reviewing the previous posts. So let me clear up my end. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I am saying that you found the questions I asked rude and insulting. I asked if you would really answer them before a congressional hearing, and doubted you would based upon your responses (I believe the distinction you make between answering such questions in a public forum or under oath really trivializes the nature of the point I was making: such questions are improper no matter where asked and do not deserve an answer). I also pointed out that such questions being asked of the President is equally as rude and should not have been asked to begin with. Dirty politics.<br>
<br>
I think we both agree that the questions should not be asked of the President (or similar questions), again &quot;dirty politics&quot;. We disagree over the end result if the questions are asked. You seem to be saying that the President was morally bound to answer such questions &quot;truthfully&quot;. No other answer would be &quot;right&quot; or &quot;good&quot;. In the case of Bill Clinton there was really only two options: answer the question &quot;truthfully&quot; or obfuscate the issue by telling a lie under oath. Silence is not an option in a congressional hearing. Especially if you are the President of the USA. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  We are going to disagree on the &quot;lie&quot; bit due, in part, because we are mutually confusing each other's view on ethics (very easy to do in a forum like this). Also, we percieve the &quot;moral world&quot; from two very different ethical systems. Neither the twain shall meet, I think. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  However, I believe that Clinton was right in trying to confuse the issue with his answer. I base my view over his lie in part on the point that the asking of the questions was not permissable and should never have been asked. I also believe that any red blooded married man who loves his family should lie to the grave about sexual impropriety to protect the reputation of his family, if he can get away with it. Why? Sex outside of marriage is a trivial thing and is not morally blameworthy. Hence should not be used as a test of morality. The only reason why there is a problem with sex outside of marriage is that the predominate moral view over sex in the USA is based upon an antiquated Puritan principle that sex is a necessary evil resulting from the fall of Adam and Eve. Recall that the view is Eve was cursed by God to bear children because of her sinful act at tempting Adam with the fruit of the Tree, hence the act of impregnation is &quot;evil&quot;, too.<br>
<br>
At any rate, the act of sex between consenting adults is not a moral act at all. It is simply a pleasurable biological function (again, some see &quot;pleasure&quot; as evil, too). I believe it is wrong to politicize sex, let alone force the issue of monogamy as some moral litmus test on our politicians. Knowing that many politicians like to appeal to Puritanical views over the &quot;morality&quot; of sex for political gain, I would have justified lying about the blow job from Monica, too, had I been Bill Clinton.<br>
<br>
I know we will disagree, Lukaria. I wanted to reiterate some points only for the sake of clarity. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>Lurikeen Mali'Kyre<BR>
