Rammadge could not tell how much time had passed since his last battle on Norrath, or how he had come to this strange new world, but he was here now, none the less.  The small town was much like Halas, a small cluster of buildings and merchants out selling their wares with a lake beside it, but some things didn't seem quite right.  Then it hit him, trolls and dark elves are in the city.  Reaching to his side for his trusty gavel the Lawbringer instead found a pitifully small and dull training sword.  Frustrated, Rammadge threw the weapon to the ground and charged a nearby troll with the familiar warcry <b>SHANKS</b>.  In an instant Rammadge saw the panic and confusion on the face of the troll, but the Lawbringers charge was intercepted by a pair of norse guards who grabbed the frenzied warrior and pinned him to the ground. <i>"I know not what ye are thinking viking, but trolls are our allies.  We will release ye now, but take care viking and better familiarize yuirself wit yuir surroundings."</i>  With a nod Rammadge obliged the guards and got up and walked out of town.  There was much wisdom in Viking Dreng's words, and Rammadge needed answers now.  Rammadge walked to the shoreline and looked down into the colm frigid waters at his face.  The stern visage he had last saw in Halas still looked back at him with the stone grey hair and the dark hollow eyes.  Looking over his surroundings Rammadge spotted a snow covered hillock and headed to the top of it to find a place of solitude to reflect and pray.  For days he hunted in the area killing wolves, spiders and all sort of odd creatures, and during the nights he would pray for guidance from the Tribunal and hope for a vision to guide him.  After five seasons of this routine the night finally came where he was granted his vision...<br>
<br>
Rammadge looked down from his frosty hilltop and spotted a fort in the distance.  Fierce barbarians lined the top of the fort walls firing volley after volley of arrows into an unending surge of assailants.  Barbarian warriors stood side by side at the gates fighting off the multitude of elves and humans who where besieging the viking stronghold.  A roar erupted somewhere within the Lawbringer and before he realized what he was doing he was in full charge to hit the invding army alone in the flank.  <b>KRAKABOOM</b>  The lightning bolt from the blue caught him full in the chest and tossed in back a number of yards and dropped him to one knee.  Hair charred and teeth still chattering Rammadge stood and charged once more with another roar erupting deep within him and echoing off the nearby hills.  <b>KRAKABOOOOM</B>  The second bolt was stronger than the first and once again found its mark upon the barbarians chest and sent him flying backwards and hitting the ground hard.  Slower now, Rammadge rose from the ground slightly dazed and began anew his charge.<br>
<br>
Walking towards Rammadge was a tall and well built norseman in shining chain and a mighty hammer in his hands.  Electricity seemed to run the corse of his body and his long flowing golden hair blew behind him in the cold crisp wind.  In a powerful and commanding voice the god of Thunder spoke <b>"Well done Lawbringer, you have passed my test.  I have need of you, Chaos and Lawlessness abound, and as you can see, injustice runs rampant.  Your viking brothers need you, your clan is here, they need you.  Step forward.  I give you this, the Hammer of Thor, to aid you in your battles.  I also give you command of lightning which you have showed you can handle, use these magics in defeating the mutants.  Go now, Rammadge the Lawbringer, Chosen of Thor, Hammer of Midgard, Thane of Justice and Shank Judge and bring justice to these lands of Camelot."</b> <br>
<br>
Rammadge blinked for a second and Thor was gone, as well as the besieged viking fort.  His course now layed out for him, Rammadge now began his new life.  Patting the new hammer at his hip Rammadge walked down the snow covered hillside and began his search for his brothers and sisters in the Shanks.  <br>
<br>
The new era of the Lawbringer has begun. <b>I AM THE LAW!</b><br>
