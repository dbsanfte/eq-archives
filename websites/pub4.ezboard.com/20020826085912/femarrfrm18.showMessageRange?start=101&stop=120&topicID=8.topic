I ask you to reread my earlier post.  I did not call for a race of children to die..I stated we as Americans may very well have to kill the children of terrorists.  Read my analogy Miblis..You can't tell me with any IQ at all in that head of yours that you don't think these fanatics won't strap explosives to their children and run them into crowds to blow them up.  THEY WILL and you know it.  Should we be in the unfortunate situation where this happens I can only hope that the poor American has the courage to pull the trigger rather than the gutless lack of willpower you show towards the whole affair.  If you can quote me saying a RACE should die then please post it..if not I ask you to please stop quoting me all together until you can learn how to properly tie a quote to a post to make a point.  And to think I wasn't even going to post here again till a coworker and fellow EQ addict pointed out to me that your were misquoting my words, so I will stick around to make sure you do not do so in the future.  I apparently know the difference between word race and terrorist when you do not.<br>

Oh and before you do that get a friend to tape it for all of us that would love to watch.  BTW you are making a fundamental error in your latest argument, it's call a false dilemma.  You are making the same mistake Sen. McCarthy on his communist witch-hunts.  He claimed that if you didn’t agree with him that you must be a communist because someone who wasn’t a communist would agree with him.  Since you seem to be a total retard I’ll explain this to you.  Just because someone doesn’t agree with you doesn’t make them a racist or un-patriotic.  Anyone with half a brain would have figured out by now that people are angry and you just keep stirring the coals.  You are a sad and pathetic person, I feel sorry for anyone who knows you.  You do indeed seem to like making everyone upset.  Whatever god you worship, he or she or it is frowning on you now.<br>

If you think that I'm a troll because I prefer to make my points succinctly instead of the long rambling rants that are more commonplace on this board, try again.  If you choose to lash out at me because I've publicly called you a hypocrite and think you're a pompous asshole, well, that's your choice.<br>

You didn't say that.  Let me quote what you said.<br>

How can children support an act of war against us, when they are too young to make any accurate judgements of their own, Poppen?  Are you going to turn in your 3 year old son to the authorities because he accidentally walked out of K-Mart with a toy?<br>

You have conviently skipped over the many times peole have pointed this out. Tell me you NEVER said anything that at some later time you might have regretted and I will call you a fucking liar. I would bet that the majority if not all the posts here are said in genuine grief and anger. Get off your fucking poor pityful me insert X race/religion/socail status/economic status/whatever the hell else,  I am a victim pony, I grow weary of it and the &quot;Boy who cried wolf&quot; syndrome that seems to blur the true instances of such actions in recent years.

Sure, I guess things CAN be said in anger and in shock.  What you're trying to do is justify the things that were said though.<br>
<br>
Can't justify it, nope.  Can't justify anyone even MENTIONING the word genocide.  That may just be my opinion, but I am not ashamed to be opinionated.<br>
<br>
You cannot justify genocide.  You cannot justify thoughts of genocide.<br>
<br>
You're trying to justify it, Lith, and that makes you just as bad as those unfortunate saps who think genocide will be fair retribution for the New York, Washington, and Pennsylvania tragedies. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/upoppensteelfist.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Poppen Steelfist</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 93<br> <font color=#E9D756>(9/14/01 3:33:04 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8.topic&index=113>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Lith</span><hr size=1> Miblis where the fuck do you see race in that post?

In the light of these tragic events and the posts on these boards hereafter, I feel it is my duty as an American to stand up for what I believe in.<br>
<br>
First, I state to you.<br>
<br>
1) The very title of this post is, in itself, a disgrace to the memory of those who died on Tuesday.  This is a time where Americans (one of which you have stated you are) need to be banding together not tearing each other apart.<br>
<br>
2) You seem to be reasonably well versed, so let me remind you that the posts on these boards were, mostly, written out of shock and terror.  America is afraid, as it was after Pearl Harbor... as it was after the sinking of the Lusitania.  Thus, America is lashing out.  Nothing you can do can calm the unrelenting anger felt in the hearts of the American people.  They may act irrationally, but you cannot chang it.  All you are succeeding in doing in continuing on your current course of actions is making individual people angry, at YOU, not your race, not your religion, not your nationality, but YOU as a person - as a human being.<br>
<br>
3) Just as you have said, the actions or words of one person usually does not reflect on the thoughts and emotions of an entire group of people.  You said it yourself.  The terrorist attacks cannot be blamed on the entire Middle Eastern region, or the Islam religion... but nor can the emotionally distressed, angry statements made by members of this board be used as a representative of the thoughts of the entirity of the American people.<br>
<br>
4) In the history of the world, there is no nation - and I repeat NO nation - who is not considered neutral who has not killed a civilian in the course of a war.  It cannot be avoided.  If children die, so be it.  It may be tragic, but it has to be done.  It may sound cold but so is war.<br>
<br>
5) Your &quot;generalization&quot; of the idea that the people of the world believe the Jewish race/culture/religion are free to do as they please because of events which took place over 50 years ago is completely out of line.  I, as an American, never once thought of the holocaust during the entirity of this event until it was brought to light in your out of context, feeble attempt at a historical allusion.  This is not World War II, this is not the holocaust, this is here, this is now.  I hate to say it, but at this point the distant and unrelated past does not matter.<br>
<br>
6) The sheer hypocracy of this post is appauling at best.  You criticize those who generalize.... yet you make assumptions about these people with no more information than a few words written in anger and emotional distress.  Using your logic, Bin Laden, Hussein, and all of the Palestenians seen dancing in the streets are, without a doubt, all conspirers, just because of the fact they did not condemn the action immediately, and because their actions in the past point to it.  You should be glad the United States government does not use your logic, or all of these people would already be in their &quot;special place in hell&quot; as you so eloquently reffered to it.<br>
<br>
7) It is obvious you are biased.  Reading some of your previous posts it can clearly be seen that you have a sort of distain for the people of Israel and the Jewish culture... the same pattern of thinking you are attempting to erase from the minds of the posters on this board.  You generalize the Israeli nation and the Jewish people... where is your &quot;place in hell?&quot;<br>
<br>
And finally, I would like to sum up with a statment.<br>
<br>
In one of your posts (I care not to dig the quote up through the thousands of redundancies) you stated something to the effect of &quot;I am an American.  I was born in America, and that's all it takes to be an American.&quot;<br>
<br>
If this is your idea of what an American is, you need to walk the streets of any major American city.  I live in Atlanta, and the scenes I have seen since this event have been both inspiring and breathtaking.  I have seen people - the day of the attack - walking with looks of shock on their faces... tears in their eyes.  I have seen people - the day after the attack - lining up to give blood to save as many as they can.  I have seen people - today - showing who they are and what they think.  I have seen highways with every car in sight flying an American flag.  I have seen entire cities of people go silent in memory.  I have seen people - despite racial, social, or political backgrounds - holding hands... weeping... remembering... shouting.  I have seen and heard the feelings, the love, and the anger of my countrymen.  They will not go unheard.<br>
<br>
And I shall conclude with a quote from Leonard Pitts.  This message goes out to everyone who hates freedom, everyone who cheers at loss of prescious of human life and, most of all, everyone who doubts the true spirit of the American people.<br>

You have opened my eyes to the err in my statement.  I retract.  <br>
<br>
'Kill em all, fuck sorting em out'<br>
<br>
Until you open your fucking eyes, and understand that coming to a message board which is 70% American, 29% on the side of America, and 1% Miblis, getting on your &quot;i'm an arab american&quot; fucking soapbox and crying about the fact that 'we' are angry about this, then conversing with you is very much a waste of everyone's time.  120+ responses...how many people agree with anything you have to say ?  <br>
<br>
I guess we are all unpatriotic bigots.  You are the only true American Miblis, we should all embrace your views, and agree that the slaughter of 5,000 plus innocent americans shouldn't make us angry.  That 5,000 mothers, fathers, sisters, brothers, friends, and children burning to death should make us think first and foremost about the thoughts of arab americans living among us and how they may be hurt by our anger.  Keep pissing into the wind, maybe we'll all get lucky and you'll drown in your own rhetoric.   <br>
<br>
I work smack dab in the middle in the largest community of arab americans outside of the middle east.  I have seen for the last 4 days their anger, their pain, over what has happened to the U.S.A., it is nothing like bullshit you come here to spew.   <br>
<br>
Take your arab american soapbox and shove it square up your ass my friend, it should fit nicely right next to your fucking head.  <br>
