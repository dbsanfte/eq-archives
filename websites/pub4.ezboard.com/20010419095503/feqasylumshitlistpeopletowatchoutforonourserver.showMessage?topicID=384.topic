Some of my friends from upstairs were complaining to me that the people in their group (i.e. Jademist) were acting crappy.  Suddenly, Jademist tells the group that he has to leave the group - when Dirtt a lev 45  character comes in and starts buffing and healing Jademist.  They then take the camp away from the other group and will not share any of the spawns.<br>
<br>
   So, after 2 hours of this Jademist has gotten 3 levels.  My friends are frustrated because they are taking all the spawns and not sharing any so they petition.<br>
<br>
   I invite my friends down to the warrior room so that we can all be together (even though they are low 20's) when Jademist starts pulling from the stairs and hallway and the Hi room and the Lo Room.<br>
<br>
   We Petition AGAIN, and not one but 3 guides are helping us out.  While PL'ing a character isn't illegal - not sharing camps IS.  The worst is yet to come......<br>
<br>
<br>
   Here is some of the conversation:<br>
[Sun Jan 21 22:34:23 2001] Dirtt says, 'I advise you not to pull my friends spawns'<br>
[Sun Jan 21 22:34:45 2001] Dirtt says, 'Or I will KS all your spawns'<br>

[Sun Jan 21 22:38:55 2001] Dirtt says, 'Im not holding whole place IF you have been watching me'<br>

 <br>
So after the gm catches them Jademist stays around invis and waits for our room to pop then trains a whole group in while we are fighting.  Goes invis, then when we are fighting trains another whole group in.<br>
<br>
  All the time he's saying things like &quot;happy birthday warrior room ;-)&quot;  Or &quot;need any help?  need any help?&quot;<br>
<br>
  Needless to say in the 6 or 7 trains we all died at least once.  But we were determined to hold the room and not be intimidated.<br>
<br>
Purposeful training is one of the most hatefull things to do in this game.  Especially in retaliation for being reported to a GM.</font><P><P><i></i></TD></TR><TR BGCOLOR=#E5E5E6><TD NOWRAP width=20% valign=top align=left><B><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2><A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/beqasylum.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=necron99>Necron99</A></FONT></B><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>n00b!</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>(</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#000033>1/22/01</FONT> <FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#000033>9:05:00 am</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>)<BR></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT><B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">Re: Jademist  (and Dirtt)</font></B><HR><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">oops,<br>

<br>
There were two healers in the group (myself, and a cleric named Marjolene) and both were consistently very low on mana because Jademist wanted to pull from another room, as well as the one we were camped in.  He continued to do this after both the cleric and I asked him to stop so that we could recover mana.  The pulls kept coming.<br>
<br>
I eventually got beat down due to healing aggro due to the extra mobs without an enchanter.  Looted my corpse and walked after that.<br>

<br>
Except I didn't bother to petition command them, folks like this just kill the fun in the game for me.  I wasn't interested in continuing to play after encountering them last night (a whole 10 mins is all it took to sour my play experience).  So I camped and watched TV instead.  Gee it been ages since I watched TV. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Tried to talk to the pair and ask if they mind sharing some of the spawns with us, but it was met with silence.  So I figured they're not interested.  No problem you where there first.  I figured we can go camp something else, but eventually Jademist said he was camping raiders.  So I thought cool, we can have warrior/lo camp right?  Wrong!!! They wanted to claim both camps.  And true noone owns a camp, but I am NOT going to argue or pnp someone over a camp.  If they don't want to share, then they really don't have too.<br>
<br>
I don't mind if you want to PL your alt or friend.  It no biggy to me and could care less, but trying to PL some place as heavily camped as HH keep and taking 2 camps (raiders and warrior/lo) is beyond my understanding.  Why not PL somewhere with one of those new exp bonuses and alot less crowded?  Besides Jademist was not in any danger with Dirtt there to heal and buff him, he should have been able to tackle yellow and red mobs for some real exp, not that blue stuff in the warrior/lo camp.  It deffinately was not for loot, since Jademist was a properly twinked out warrior.  So it had to be exp, and at 27 there are alot of places to PL at that are not crowded.<br>
<br>
Do I think you deserve to be on the poop list for it?  No.<br>
<br>
I was just surprised that you where up here.  It seems that the two of you were beening naughty boys to others as well yesterday.  Shame on you!!! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Oh, one more thing, if the healers in your group tell you lom do not think that means go pull some more and see if anyone is left alive afterwards just because you are in a hurry to level.  That applies to any level puller out there.<br>
<br>
Maybe you were having a bad day or something, I don't know. /sigh<br>

Because it WASN'T Soloable.  And it was always two-three mobs.

I suppose he should not be held responsable for Jademist's actions, since Jademist was doing all the pulling and Dirtt was just hanging around buffing and healing him (no real crime in that).<br>
<br>
   They WERE real pissed that we called the GM's (not just us i see but about 4 other people) and even though we were in the warrior room for at least 7 hours Jademist would still come to the doorway looking for spawns.<br>
<br>
   Not just my group and I found Jademist's actions bad sportsmanshiply (is that a word? :-) ) but you can go to Kerra Isle and kill to your hearts content for all I care, I go to HH cause I find it hard to get a group unless I frequent crowded areas.<br>
<br>
   Evidently Dirtt just came to the defense of his RL friend, although he had no idea that he was wrong in defending him.  He did tell the Guide to &quot;shut up&quot;, but he seemed to not know that he was in the wrong.<br>
<br>
   His guild kicked him out today - that was the other thing he wanted to tell me.<br>
<br>
   All in all, he could have been more Democratic about it and it was a rough situation all around, but I still dont appreciate getting trained for reporting to a GM and I appreciate dying in those trains even less - no matter if you have any idea if it is happening or not<br>

<br>
I have had a run in with Dirtt.  My partner and I were camping Halv in SF.  Dirtt pops in like he just logged on.  I inform him that Halv was camped, but that he was welcome to the camp when we were done.  Dirtt tells us that he wasn't after the camp, and that he didn't need Halv.  He was red to me, so I took his word.   About 3 mins later Halv pops, in the time it took me to stand up, Dirtt had already begun to blast him.  My partner and I tried to out blast him (at the time she was 30 I was 34) but we could not keep up.  After looting Halv,  Dirtt comes over to gloat.  I asked him why he lied to and KS'd me.  He only laughed at us and told me to relax.  I tried to reason with him, he only made fun of us.  I then threatened talk to his guild about the matter.  Upon hearing that he quickly logged.<br>
<br>
 About 2 mins later Dirtt comes back.  I informed him that I was speaking with an officer of TSO about his actions.  He then claimed to have no knowledge of what he just did.   He claimed that it was his &quot;friend&quot; with whom he shares an account.   While Dirtt was blabbering about how the incident was not his fault he mentioned the names of his alts.  One of which my partner and I grouped with on a few occasions when we both played other classes (many moons ago).  Now let me make one point very clear, Dirtt DID NOT know who we are.  He was never a friend, he was just some one with whom we grouped a few times.  After speaking with the TSO officer and having a few mins. to cool off, I told the TSO officer to drop the matter and that I wouldn't pursue it as long as it was an isolated incident.<br>
<br>
It appears that this was not an isolated incident, or that Dirtt is letting his friend on his account again.  Regardless of who is at the controls, Dirtt is the character committing these offences.<br>
<br>
TSO was completely honorable about the whole affair.  They responded quickly to my request to speak with them, and they seemed genuinely concerned with the problem I had with one of their members.  This is in NO WAY a slam on them.<br>

Besides based on my encounter I didn't think he should be on the poopie list.  and Jademist wasn't in a guild at the time.<br>
<br>
And while Dirtt was only buffing and such he left his guild tag up, no biggy since he wasn't doing anything bad.  But before the arguing and claiming 2 camps started he went anoun from roleplay, there by hiding his guild tag.  Too late my alt already saw the guildtag, besides a /guildstatus will give the guild even if you are anoun.  I have friends in and have grouped with may from his guild and just thought he would play up to the same standard that the rest did.  But I never bothered the officers, since I didn't think it was a big deal , my atls enounter with Jademist and Dirtt.  It was just typical HH crap.  I am sure if you all think back to your days in HH and the keep stuff like camp arguements and stuff happened all the time, which is why I never really liked hunting there.  Camp aruguments and KSing really turn me off to this game and I tend to camp and go watch TV or read or something else instead.</font><P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#FF00FF"><b><I>Tsulyra Shadowhawk</I></b></font><br>

<br>
I think it might be a good idea at this point to make an FAQ with guidelines and steps to be taken before shitlisting a person. Just saying &quot;posts that don't belong here will be deleted&quot; is not enough - way too vague, and it won't stop premature or inappropriate posting.<br>
<br>
To make everyone see it, put a link to this FAQ in giant flashing letters at the top of this board so that anyone who might ever post can and will see it.<br>
<br>
Make it something like the following:<br>
<br>
If player x does something bad to you, before posting here do the following:<br>
<br>
1. Guilded players<br>
a. Turn on logging. As much as these can be forged, etc., the guildleaders/officers can compare your log with that of others in the situation and get a better idea of what is going on.<br>
b. See if the person is in a guild (he/she may be anon, so you might not know by just looking at the tag). If in a guild, do a /w all &lt;guildname&gt; or even a /guildstatus player x if anon just to be sure.<br>
c. Contact a random member of the guild listed and ask for the name of the leader or an officer who is online (unless you know the guildleader or an officer). Discuss the situation. Keep logging on during the discussion so you have something to look at later if you still feel you need to post. (looking back to see if the situation was resolved as best it could be for the time being might hold of your post for a while, plus, people have selective memories. read the log again and MAKE SURE)<br>
d. If the guild leaders/officers were not responsive to your request for discussion, post to their web page BEFORE POSTING HERE. If they do not have a web page, give it another day and try and contact them through tells, etc. (trying different guild members to ask for leaders/officer names for the sake of accuracy)<br>
e. If for some strange reason, none of the above steps produce any results within a weeks time, continue on to step 3.<br>
<br>
2. Unguilded players<br>
a. Turn on logging (to help you write your post, if you make one. BE SURE that you were not inflaming the situation and making it worse. BE SURE that you have given the other person the benefit of a doubt)<br>
b. Try and discuss the situation with the person in question. (the GMs will ask you to if you didn't)<br>
b. Petition the situation with a /report of some of what the player is saying that you find offensive or unjust, or that adds strength to your reason for petitioning.<br>
(instructions and general guidelines for petitioning, reporting can go here). Try and resolve the situation with the GM and person (assuming a GM shows up).<br>
c. If none of this is helping, proceed to step 3.<br>
<br>
3. Write out your post in an offline text editor and read it a few times. Sleep on it, then read it a few more times. If you still feel this person merits shitlisting, then copy and paste your post, but be sure that you are right. Reputations are a hard thing to fix, and wrongly accusing someone can hurt yours as well.<br>
<br>
<br>
Ok, that's about it. A very rough draft as I'm throwing it together while at work. Run with it, or I will help you finish it, but I strongly feel we need something up there for people to look at before posting if we are going to complain about improper posting.<br>
