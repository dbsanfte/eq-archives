I never really knew my father, as he died while I was still a baby. My mother told me he died when one of his spells backfired. I never challenged that though from what I heard from others this was not the whole truth. Looking back I see where my mother spoiled me rotten. A lot I think had to do with my father being gone, I can only wonder the person I would be if I would have had some discipline. I never took anything seriously. I was told at a young age that I had the potential to be a great magic user. My mother being a great caster herself sought to train me in the arts. However, I sought to avoid the training as I was more interested in playing with friends and getting into mischief. She kept telling me to practice that I was already capable of things that some mages strive their whole life for, and I wasn't even really trying. My mother soon decided that she would let me forge my own way after years of trying to get me to take my gift seriously. The years flowed by and I jumped from this training to that, learning knife fighting, hunting, or anything that happened to catch my fancy, even though I never completed any of it. At the rip old age of 50, when I am actually close to be considered an adult by my people, a call for war rang out.<br><br>Our cousins the wood elves, had been attacked by the orcs. We haven't always had close relations with our cousins, but this one one thing we could agree on. The world would be a better place without orcs. So the call for war rang out, and the warriors and magic users prepared to join our cousins in a cleansing of the woods outside Kelethin. My mother now having been on the council for a few years was chosen as one of the ones to stay behind with a handful of guards to keep Felwithe safe. This is where my life was about to take a drastic change.<br><br>I heard about the coming purging of the woods and thought little about it. I took off again on my own to see what trouble I could find. What the people of Felwithe didn't know was that Emperor Crush was not in on these attacks alone. This was a planned incursion in order to draw all our forces away from Felwithe and leave it vulnerable. Crush was in league with the ogres and trolls, and while the forces of Felwithe were gone they attacked. <br><br>I spent the day chasing pixie tricksters, trying to catch one, then fell asleep under a tree. I woke the next morning and decided to head home. When I got close to the gates, I could feel something was wrong. My skin was tingling, a feeling I only got when a massive discharge of magic had been released. First thing I noticed was no guards at the entrance. I went more carefully now looking around, but nothing could prepare me for what I was going to see. Bodies were everywhere, or should I say, what was left of bodies were everywhere. I turned and emptied my stomach until I was dry heaving. The first thing in my mind was where was mother. I went to our house which was intact, but she was no where to be found. I called out for her, and no one answered. I headed to the council chambers, and to my complete horror I found her. The ogres and trolls had had their way with her. She was tied staked out on the floor. She had arcane symbols carved into her body, from some evil rite. The charred remains of ogres and trolls testified to the toll they had paid to get to her. Her blood was everywhere. I dropped to my knees beside her and cradled her head in my lap as I used my knife to cut her bonds and my tunic to clear away the blood and cried. I rocked her back and forth promising I would do whatever she wanted if she would only come back to me. <br><br>When the army returned the next day that is where they found me. I would not let her go and they had to put a sleep spell on me to get me out of there. When I awoke the next day, it all came crashing down on me again. It was my fault. If I had only been here, I could have helped. If I had done my studies as mother had wished, maybe this would have turned out differently. I decided I couldn't live with the fact that so much death was laid at my feet. I sought to end my life that day by casting a fire spell at my feet. When I started the incantation I was quickly tackled by someone from behind. They tied me to the bed and for the next several days they had someone in the room keeping an eye on me. I remained that way for months, as I had friends and others come to talk to me, to try and help me with my pain. Looking back they might have been better off in letting me kill myself, because after a while pain turned into rage.<br><br>When they let me up, I went to train with any wizard that would have me. I didn't learn the mage arts. I wanted revenge, it hammered at my thoughts. I would have my revenge on the ones who took my mother from me. I went after the battle magics. I would become the wizard that would one day shake the evil empires of the ogres and trolls to their foundations. I would not rest, until everyone had paid in blood for what they had been done to me. I would be justice without mercy, there would be no quarter given. I would cleanse Norrath of this evil.<br><br>I sunk myself into my studies. My instructors were becoming concerned as I shunned learning anything but battle magic. They decided to quit teaching me as I was becoming powerful, without learning to control my hate. When they told me of their fears, I told them I didn't need them. They were other ways to learn the arts. I left Felwithe and decided my hunt could now begin. I knew that I was as of yet not powerful enough to take on ogres and trolls, but orcs, I could take. Maybe I would get lucky and meet Emperor Crush as well.<br><br>My journey to Crushbone went well. My name is now feared above all others. I met up with Emperor Crush, and as he cowered behind his throne,I destroyed one after the other, his guards and advisers. I will not go in to what was done. Suffice it to say that he took a long time to die.<br><br>After my successful campaign in Crushbone, I journeyed across the sea to Freeport. A human city, with all the confusion evident that we were taught was in their minds. It was there that I heard of the orc problem that they has in the Oasis of Marr. I checked out the next morning to head to the Oasis and see what was happening. I got to the docks and I heard that the rumors were true. The orcs had a powerful hold on this area, at a place the locals called Orc Highway. I joined an intrepid group and headed out to make the Oasis a safer place. <br><br>After many weeks of hunting the orcs, I still couldn't find any information on where to go to get to the root of the problem, so decided to follow another rumor I heard at the docks. The rumor was of a small island in the Timorous Deep, used as an outpost by the ogres. After talking to others I decided to investigate the area. I grabbed the barge from Oasis to TD and there discovered that these ogres were young and mostly untrained. I proceeded to cleanse the island of their presence. I was doing well at defeating them, even though they did hurt me quite a bit, but I was holding my own. Then I met an ogre named The Great Oowomp, and he hurt me very badly, the only way I survived was a passing cleric healing me as I ran. I made a vow that I would return one day and have a long discussion with Oowomp and see how great he really was.<br><br>Along about this time I received a message from a friend of my youth named Scarce. Scarce was a powerful cleric, and said he could use my help. In a keep in Highhold Pass, goblins had tunneled in and had taken over the basement levels, and killing anyone venturing down there. I packed up and went there right away.<br><br>When I got to Highkeep, and it was a vision out of your worst nightmares. Bodies of previous adventurers were everywhere. The groups were now starting to hold their own, so I stepped into line and did my best to help. It was here that I first was to meet my future lord. We ended up in a group together to tame the lower regions and reclaim it from the Picklaw Warriors and Raiders. He was a human, so I was a little leery at first as I had not been around many. After fighting for weeks together we developed a trust between us, and My Lord Abackus invited me into his guild, The Onyx Illumination. I was pleased to accept and to hear that the major role was to spread the light of peace and righteousness to all corners of Norrath. It has healed my heart some to know that I have others I can count on in a time of need with the the same goals of right over might. I am excited by the possibilities of what we can do together. My quest still continues, to right the wrongs done to people who can't defend themselves.<br><br>Behold I sayeth unto the creatures who caused my pain, I will not rest until my mothers rape and death is avenged with your blood. I will hunt you down, I will bathe in the blood of you and your kind where ever I find them. I bringeth great destruction to all who would take a mother away from her family, a wife from her husband, to any who would harm the innocent for their own power or unholy appetites. So sayeth Tillaron, your nemeses in this life and the next.<br><br>Tillaron the Channeler <br><br> <p>Tillaron the ChannelerTremble and quake for I am POWER!!!</p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrroleplaying.showNextMessage?topicID=164.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrroleplaying.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=164.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/gfx/addReply1.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrroleplaying.emailToFriend?topicID=164.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrroleplaying.threadControl?topicID=164.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/deleteThreadFire.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrroleplaying.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=164.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrroleplaying.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=164.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub4.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="emarrmessageboardrules">Message Board Rules<option value="emarrlinks">Links<option value="emarrupcomingmmorpgs">Upcoming MMOG's<option value="emarrfrm16">The Emarr Quadrant<option value="emarrfrm18">America Under Attack<option value="emarrfrm19">Dark Age of Camelot<option value="emarrgeneral">General<option value="emarrfrm17">Funny Stuff<option value="emarrbazaar">Item Bazaar<option value="emarrscrollsnspells">Spell Bazaar<option value="emarrfrm15">Shiny Things<option value="emarrfrm14">Bargain Basement<option value="emarrdragonsandplanes">Rants and Flames<option value="emarrfrm13">Dragons and Planes<option value="emarrroleplaying">Roleplaying<option value="emarrroleplayingoocforum">Roleplaying - OOC Forum<option value="emarrscammeralert">Scammer Alert<option value="emarrsignaturecorner">Test Forum<option value="emarrreallife">Real Life<option value="emarrothermmorpgs">Other MMOG's</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#E9D756>- </font><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/bemarr>Erollisi Marr, The Queen of Love</a><font color=#E9D756> - </font><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrroleplaying>Roleplaying</a> <font color=#E9D756> - </font><br><br> <br><br><center><font face="Verdana" size="2">Entertaining the Erollisi Marr community since 12/16/99!</font></center><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br> <br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.6<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
