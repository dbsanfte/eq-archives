We are the only class that really needs to be able to target every mob not currently being engaged by the main assist. To do this takes time and practice. You just have to learn the natures of specific mobs. There are several targetting techniques and you will use everyone of them. I will list a few off here and Im sure there are many others that I dont use that other enchanters will gladly add.<br>
<br>
1)Stun Select. This is probably one of the most common. The basic idea is this; The puller brings all the mobs back to you camp spot. He has one selected and everyone else assists off of him. You lay down a color stun to stun all the mobs. This prevents mobs from attacking or moving. The only mob that will be moving is the one being attacked. He is getting beat to death and is moving in response to all the weapons hitting him. You simply select one of the other mobs and mesmerize it. Now the mobs will be aggro on you so just rinse and repeat stuns for as many times is necessesary.<br>
<br>
2)Line em up. This is a good tactic in Sebilis and chardok as you usually have a lot of area to work with. The puller brings back the mobs. However, the puller stops short of the camp. You simply use F8 to select a mob and mesmerize. The puller then moves forward a couple steps and you again hit f8 and mesmerize. Rinse and repeat for as many times necessesary. This requires you and the puller coordinate somewhat but it allows probably the most control over your mobs as it gets them nice and spaced out.<br>
<br>
3)Mez em all. This is a good tactic if the puller is bringing back bunches of mobs at a time. Just use ae mez and mezmerize all the mobs brought back. Keep refreshing the mez until you get down to 2 or 3 mobs. Then switch to normal mez. If the puller brings back more then 5, then hit F8, AE mez. Step back and let the rest of the mobs come forward some and AE mez that group. This is the most effective train stopping technique. I used it very often in Karnor. Deavi used to go and pull trains of mobs all the way from the hand room. I would be playing enchanter and cleric on my second coumpter. So I had to be able to control the mobs easily. Using AE mez in this way automagically groups your mobs into their 4 or 5 mob groupings so its easy to keep them all mezed. <br>
<br>
4)Health check. This is probably the hardest targetting technique but still useful. Really all you do is click around in different spots until you find a mob with full health. Look to make sure he is moving(not already mezed) and mez him. Usualyl only do this if 2 mobs are present.<br>
<br>
5)Overhead view. I have never gotten used to switching views in combat so I dont use this but have heard of other people that switch views to get a better targetting angle on a mob. <br>
<br>
6)Changing positions. Sometimes it helps in a situation to change your position so that you have a better view of the battle. Moving around and hitting F8 to see if you get another target selected and if you do, just throw out your mez.<br>
<br>
7)healer agro. Im sure the healer doesnt like this but if a healer heals a tank and you havent gotten some of the mobs yet, Those mobs will in most cases, turn their attention to the healer. This allows you to seperate them some and use the Stun Select technique on the mobs attacking the healer.<br>
<br>
<br>
You will find in a play session, that you may use many of these techniques. If you are moving a group into a virgin area(not currently being camped or overcamped) then you will use the &quot;Mez em all&quot; technique a lot at first. But as time goes by and the mobs become more spaced out, you will use &quot;Stun Select&quot; a little more or maybe &quot;Line em up&quot; depending on how much room you have. You wil lalso find that you use combinations of these techniques on single pulls. If you use &quot;mez em all&quot;, but are only left with two mobs after the mez, then you are just gonna &quot;Stun Select&quot; or &quot;Health Check&quot; to select the one mob not being attacked. <br>
<br>
There are probably a ton more techniques that I havent mentioned but the above have never failed me.<br>
<br>
p.s. I failed to mention a nice tip on minimizing interruptions to casting. While you are moving around, sometimes you get interrupted even though you have stopped moving for the last 2 seconds. This is caused by the lag between the client and server knowing what is going on. The server thinks you are still moving and thus interrupts your casting. If you get in the habit of twisting slightly everytime you stop, you will never have a problem with interruptions again. The small movement left or right tells the server you are done moving and are just turning thus will never confuse your movement to be an interruption. It jsut takes a small tap fo the left or right arrow key and will help you quite a bit.<br>

When there are only two mobs and they are the same name, you'll notice that the mob being hit starts to get knocked back so the mob to be mezzed is slightly closer and is beating on the tank or puller, easy to target this mob. I've also found that I've been relying on AE mez quite a bit lately, and it's ok even if I get a resist and happen to mez myself. I can just stun the mob that resisted me, since they aggro and break the mez on me, then back up and enthrall.<br>

Tried 1 a few times, but somehow never works when I want it to. &lt;sigh&gt;  Closest I&quot;ve come to 2 is mezing one as the puller is bringing them in.<br>
<br>
Maelinie, I found this out too :).  Another way (easier from what I&quot;ve seen) to do this is to stand behind the tanks (for some reason they all stay to one side of the mob, with or without rogues &lt;shrug&gt;) and hit your F8 key after about a second or two.  This will target the mob they aren't hitting (because the one they are hitting is now behind the one you targeted).  Then mez.  You can sometimes pick out 2 or 3 this way in a large pull.<br>
<br>
As for AE mez, don't use it.  Don't find the need to use it often enough that I make it a perminant spell in my lineup, and if I do need it, don't have the time to get it up.  I still seem to get by tho.<br>

If he knows he'll only get 4 or less no matter what, AE mez isn't memmed. If we're doing some screwy area like hand room in karnor's, or if things are going really smoothly in seb or charasis and people start getting more relaxed, I'll mem AE mez.<br>
<br>
the only problem with the 52 AE mez i've seen is mezzing yourself, since it has a built-in lower mez resist (or so it seems, never did a test, an the placebo effect is very real, but despite getting more and more MR since I was using the old level 16 AE mez I still seem to mez myself more and more with fascination. This isn't a problem if one of the mobs resists and hits you, or you have so many that AE mez doesn't get them all anyway and you can then sit and get aggroed, but if you're fighting low blues, you'll pretty much have VERY LOW resist rate with this. You'd think with 142 MR in normal gear + grouping situations this wouldn't be a problem, but sure enough it still happens, and more than it to just be a fluke.<br>
<br>
Another sort of related method to targetting, though, is to watch the bouncing names. This takes a lot of time to figure out and get a feel for it, as mobs normally look exactly alike (do chardok exp at zone for awhile, whole lot of sarnaks) and it's hard to tell initially which one's name bounces timed with all the melee and stuff... normally the main assisted mob will be bouncing up and down more due to being hit. being hit also produces a different animation and the name bounces up and down at a different rate. I suppose this is picked up without trying just by using the stun and pick strategy and being resisted with the stun. If it takes too long to pick (and sometiems the actual clicking on a mob can be troublesome. when in doubt, run right between the fella's legs and click somewhere on yer screen, you'll usually get him all the time) you can use the HP method by seeing which mobs are full health.<br>
<br>
You should try fun places like Chardok Royals were you have no problems with targetting cause you get 10 mob pulls. if it's moving and not surrounded by 15 melee, it's mez bait :P (managed to do a single fight with level 52-54ish sarnaks, totaling 22 of them between initial pull plus adds, with qestlian and cidric, back a few months ago. In many ways, it's &quot;easier&quot; on us cause we just mez stuff, and there's never a shortage of mobs that obviously  need mezzing so there's never a problem finding/targetting/casting on it. That was still the most exciting fight from an enc's point of view though.<br>
<br>
But I generally use the stun targetting tactic in an area where resists are low. mezzing one as the group of mobs is inc sometimes needs to be discussed with the puller if he's the main assist. sometimes he'll target one when he pulls and that's the one he'll go after once the mobs are at camp. Also don't try this with feign pullers <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
For targetting, the best thing I can add is KNOW THE AREA. make sure your main assist knows the area equally well. as far as I've played, it has been my job to tell the main assist what to grab first, second, third out of a group of mobs. This is especially needful in areas with vastly different MR on mobs (hate and fear ring a bell?) Cleric of Innoruuk and a Kiraikuei get pulled, and I'll have the mummy mezzed at the same time the main assist is shouting for assist on the cleric.<br>
<br>
It's not quite as black and white in most areas, but most of the time it's still there. You could base it solely on levels if you want. The important thing is both you and the main assist are a) actively using this method and b) you both agree on the order to kill stuff.<br>
<br>
And you know, I've been playing noggel since late 1999 when lanys first opened, never have used F8 to target ever.. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :\ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":\"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I miss somethin? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Best use I've seen for using alternate view modes personally is when I'm outdoors in the middle of a big area. Camping the one named wurm spawn in BW is a good example of this, where mobs sneak up on you from all angles. The spawn is also in a small clearing so you can see all around you. I've tried using other camera angle things, but I just couldn't get used to it.<br>
