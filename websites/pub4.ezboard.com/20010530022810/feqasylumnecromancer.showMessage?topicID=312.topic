Well after thinking about this for a bit more is Iksar Necro really the way to go? Oh and am i wrong on any of those things? And if so please let me know and add why you think or dont think that iksar necro is the way. I wanted to start one as soon as i get back but it really seems that they get a lot of cons to go with those pros. Heck the iksar warriors cant even wear COLBOLT!!!<br>

Personally, though, I think Iksar necros have a great appearance.  In addition, I like the fact that there really isn't all that many of us around.<br>
<br>
One thing you did miss in advantages is the fact that FoB blows every other newbie zone away, and when that is done the forest giant fortress in WW is about a minute and a half run away.  You are set until 30. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
Edit:  Another advantage to consider is you can kill in Kaesora, Howling Stones, and Karnors without ruining your faction with the 50+ spell vendor and the 51-54 quest only scroll dude.</font><P><p align="center"><img src="http://members.home.net/troyjohnson/transadv.gif" border="0"><P><i><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub66.ezboard.com/beqasylum.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=atriz>Atriz</A> at: 2/19/01 2:35:04 pm</FONT><br></i></TD></TR><TR BGCOLOR=#D5D4D5><TD NOWRAP width=20% valign=top align=left><B><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2><A HREF=http://pub66.ezboard.com/uzathule.showPublicProfile?language=EN>zathule</A></FONT></B><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>p0\/\/3r-p0sT3r!</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>(</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#000033>2/19/01</FONT> <FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#000033>2:44:23 pm</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>)<BR></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT><B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">Re: Iksar Necro? Really worth it?</font></B><HR><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">&gt;Goods:<br>
&gt;Starting Resist.<br>
?? We have slightly better fire resist and worse cold resist was all i noticed.<br>
<br>
&gt;Start as a good swimmer.<br>
Swimming is 100 to start, with some kind of holding breath bonus, but by the time you hit 50+ almost everyone has 200swim anyway.  Just borrow a fishbone earring and AFK swim overnight some time and anyone can max swimming.<br>
<br>
&gt;They have the regen.<br>
This is UBER imo.  It is double normal char regen(i think). So at 51-57 you are at 12sitting 6standing.  58+ is when you start getting 16sitting 8standing.  This makes a HUGE difference with lich.  A friend let me take over a 2nd account, since he was quitting.  This account has a 51 DE necro on it.  It is an amazing difference how long a DE vs Iksar can stay liched.  Yes you can just cast BoD, but you need to do it much more often with the DE.  BoD is not the most mana efficient damage DoT we have either.  And for soloing that regen is a huge different from level 1 on.<br>
<br>
&gt;And I think there might be more but this is all i got so far.<br>
<br>
Two minor things to add....<br>
<br>
Natural AC bonus<br>
<br>
Iksar necros at lvl 1 start with about +18ac over a DE necro with same starting AGI.  By level 60 this bonus is about 40ac (not sure on the exact numbers but this is what others have mentioned). <br>
<br>
<br>
Forage (race ability)<br>
<br>
You start with skill 40 or 50 as a racial ability. It is enough that you can feed yourself if you can remember to use the skill as it recycles.<br>
<br>
&gt;Bad:<br>
&gt;KOS everywhere except in Cab.<br>
Yep.  The only thing here is plan out your hunting so you can gain XP while earning faction.  Example, lvl 16ish you might want to hunt in highpass to earn enough faction to bank there from killing gnolls/orcs and eventually goblins in the basement.<br>
<br>
Zathule has worked on faction on and off since he was a young broodling so he can now bank in: freeport, neriak, rivervale, highpass, runnyeye, qeynos (via necro guild bank), paineel, FV, KD.  Again, you need to take a break from XPing now and again and quest/kill for faction.  If you dont enjoy doing this then you can always use mules or play another race.<br>
<br>
&gt;Exp Penalty<br>
This is a fact of life.  But if you just want to hit 60 fast play another race.  As long as you know you will stick to your necro and get to 51+, so what about this xp penality.  Play smarter and XP at the best places and you will never notice anything.  As I recall, zath hit 49+ in about 25 days(+/- a couple days).  But this time was focused on one thing XP.  He did not bother to get banking access at any town besides highpass and paineel, did not item camp, did not log on and chit-chat, logged on and XPed at certain spots until it was time to move on (treants, rangers, etc...).<br>
<br>
&gt;And now after checking out all the stuff that an iksar necro can wear they really get hurt!<br>
<br>
Yes, iksar are hard to dress up.  But all that means is picking and chooseing your equipment well.  Wrist slot items are very hard to find.  Zath still uses AC ring and bracer of woven grass (Supple scale armband will replace woven grass someday).  This said, you can still get int to 200 and be wearing the standard HP gear at 51+ (velium neck/rings).<br>
<br>
&gt;Less starting INT than most other races.<br>
Iksar max is same has human 110.  Starting with less mana, regen and more AC meant that zathule was a melee necro until all melee skills were maxed (level 44).  That made a huge difference in keeping pets alive at lower levels.  He was only slightly twinked (in low teens) with GSD, feasting cloak, 200pp, etc.....  The twinkage was minor but helpful.  Zath went to the XP/cash places to buy all the other low/mid end items which he used to 51ish. So equipment is not that big of a deal, imo.<br>
<br>
<br>
Zathule is now lvl 55 and the only iksar defiler on lanys. (no big deal)  As far as I can tell there are only a couple other iksar necros in the 51+ range that still play.  So we are very rare race/class combo at high levels.  51-55 is a long road that causes many people to loose interest.  Seems like the main reason there are so few iksar necros is becuase the hardcore gamers already started their DE/gnome necros when the server was new and new people get intimidated that 'iksar necros are hard to play' for the above reasons.  <br>
<br>
The challenges are many, but if you know a bit about EQ then it is no problem with a little planning (equipment/faction) and iskar are alot of fun vs a yet another DE/gnome necro.<br>
<br>
To sum it up.  After 55 levels I have NEVER regretted playing an iksar vs any other race.  Iksar necros and monks are the best race/class combos among the iksar choices imo.  But there are alot more iksar monks these days.<br>
<br>
When you make your decision please post it and the reason(s) you decided to go that way.<br>
<br>
<br>
Happy gaming,<br>

It's entirely possible to go from 1 - 60 without ever leaving Kunark, and you won't even be stuck in half-assed zones doing it!<br>
<br>
1 - 16 Field of Bone, Swamp of No Hope, Kurns Tower<br>
<br>
16 - 27 Lake of Ill Omen, Warsilik's Woods, The Overthere<br>
<br>
27 - 35 Crypt of Dalnir, Frontier Mountains<br>
<br>
35 - 44 The Overthere, Kaesora, Dreadlands<br>
<br>
44 - 50 Dreadlands, City of Mist<br>
<br>
50 - 60 Skyfire, Burning Wood, Karnor, Sebilis<br>
<br>
Plus, everyone will hate you as a necromancer regardless of your race, so it's not that big a loss.<br>
<br>
As for the armor, this is where you come out ahead.  Iskar have scaly skin, which gives them a higher natural AC but makes them unable to wear plate.  Well, as a caster, you can't wear plate anyway, so you just get the nice little natural AC bonus.<br>
<br>
You have a good point about the int thing though. It's VERY costly getting iksar up to 200 int.  However, with the iksar natural regeneration, you can regain the mana you have more quickly due to Allure, CoB and similar spells, so it kind of evens out.<br>
<br>
But the biggest thing that turns me away from the iksar, and the main reason that I don't have an iksar necromancer, is their skeleton and Call of Bones animation.  They're HUMAN skeletons!!  It's a minor thing, I know, but it's really lame in my opinion to summon a human looking skeleton and turn into a human looking skeleton when you're an iksar.  I had an iksar necromancer once, long ago, and this drove me nuts. It was a splinter in my mind that contributed to my making a DE necro.<br>
<br>
Personally, I prefer Dark Elves, due to high starting int, ultravision, and Hide skill, although if they had the iksar skeletal animations, it would probably be about a tie.<br>
<br>
All in all, the only &quot;wrong&quot; choice for a necromancer (or for any class, for that matter) is human. They just plain suck.<br>

Keep in mind it can take alot of time. <br>
<br>
Example for raising RV faction zathule (so far) has spent about 16hrs in runnyeye king room killing king/elites, while mostly afk (always look for auto-attacking mobs that your pet can solo while you stand there and do nothing).  Plus, doing the bandge quest in misty ( about 400 times).  While is wolf form he is no long kos to anyone but the evil halfling cleric guild.  So this puts him about 1/2 to 2/3 done with RV faction work while not in wolf form.  The only remotely good thing about RV faction is now my mules are well dressed in BI armor. ;-)<br>
