HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! omg this boy have a brain at all?<br>
<br>
BTW Barrelrider/Punchum is lying. He came to CoM to help kill Reavers. HE proceeded to totally screw up the pull and get us all killed (after which he left without rezzing the rogue. I assume he did this so we couldn't get back in) He was promised that he would get a Trance stick IF IT DROPPED, that was all. A few days later I looted one in Com and was auctioning it, when I get a tell form him demanding it. But you know if he hadnt blamed me for the bad pull and left us like he did in CoM i might just have given it to him. Later his monk Punchum, grouped with us in EW. A rygor bracer dropped, he looted it and refused to random it. There's the truth of the matter. (hopefully Barrelrider/Punchum has some logs he can post to show what an ass he was too)<br>
<br>
Valric... you are such a fool.  You did try to ks Crystal Eyes I'm convinced now. Too bad you didnt just accept my apology for accusing you at the time (when you denied it in a very nasty manner). Why don't you post that pleasant little exchange? That's when you earned my contempt. I'll bet folks would love to know where my dislike of you began. <br>
<br>
Of all the active players on Emarr you and Barrelrider/Punchum are the only ones to make my ignore list since I was level 10 in Crushbone. Congrats, thats almost 2 years ago. Not because you made &quot;mistakes&quot; as could be the case, but because you are both such nasty greedy foul mouthed liars. You are probably the only players Wammbamm has EVER cursed out, I usualy play her as the kind gentle type. (Kelewala on the other hand loves to curse assholes, hehe.) <br>
<br>
Now before you get Badwala (my evil alter ego) on your ass, I suggest you find another world to play in. Do us all a favor. <br>

There is also a thread on Dragons and Planes entitled &quot;The Fairest Way in PoG&quot; or something like that, where I laid out my experiences with the guy.  Some additional details, including Valric's admission that he tried to get Yanedanielle killed on purpose during a raid, can be found on this board under the title &quot;Odd, or No?&quot;  If you go back further, you'll find Gorndax's aptly titled post &quot;Valric you pathetic piece of shit.&quot;  I think there was also a thread where Valric was trying to find a guild after CoH disbanded, entitled something like &quot;Rogue with Epic Looking for Guild.&quot;  Along with the accounts in this thread, that should be plenty for you.<br>
<br>
As for the Valric 1.0 vs. Valric 2.0 thing, I'm not buying it.  Sometimes he will claim that Valric 1.0 did something, but then later admit that he did it himself.  This guy may have some mental disorders, or he may just be a bad liar.  If there really are two people playing on the account, they're both pond scum. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uvalricentreri.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Valric Entreri</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 194<br> <font color=#E9D756>(8/16/01 3:09:08 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: here ya go..</span><hr size=1> Sagemon, your grossly mis-construed, I don't care if you don't believe what I say, but hey anyway life goes on.

But yes, I would find much pleasure in seeing him cast on a named in the castle and watch as he dies by a train which he created.<br>
<br>
As for Crystal Eyes? Nope, you all weren't even up there yet. I aggro'ed, ran past the ledge right below, your enchanter casted on it after that mezzed it at your group. Then you proceeded to kill the statues while I came back to claim my pull. Seeing I came back you decided to root it, and all jump on it. From hence I recieved about 9 /rudes from you and then a screen full or two of 'BACK OF OR I CALL GM' to which I replied, go ahead. I mean if you where camping at the spawn, it would be ok. But nope, your brilliant ass decided to kill a mob which no one had claim to it until I had aggro'ed it, at that point it belongs to whoever aggros it.

Who the fuck cares if he took ur pull or tried to steal your pull hey did you ever think that it was an axident that wam mezed CY because kele saw it as an add?? anyway..i know kele can be a pain sometimes makeing sure everything is perfect but he sure as hell knows EXACTLY what he is doin and i think i know why barrelrider left the grp that day, its because after buffing,makeing everything perfect ect. then pulling and failing is very disappointing and makes you do irrational things!<br>

anyway thats my opinion and i happen to like kele and valric and dont like to see you 2 argueing over such trivial matters<br>

I don't actually like argueing over stupid things like this either, hence why I never posted it. I told him plain as day, shut up, quit being a whiny little asshole and threatening me, or I will post it. <br>
<br>
When CE spawned he stayed up for like 5-10 minutes, so we decided to check it out, no one there. I aggro, run a bt, jump down to next level. Then their chanter casts on it, who happened to be Kelewala/Wammbamm I believe. Well come to find out when I ran past his group they and head down, no spider comes, so I run back up, he has it mezzed right there. So I put in say, that was my pull. Backstab it and break the mezz. Kelewala roots it. They kill their statue spawns and then CE. <br>
<br>
One /rude from the enchanter, then like 9 from Kelewala followed by a screen full or two of that crap leave now or I call gm. I honestly wish he would have, would have been awfully nice of his group to kill a named so we can have loot for our group.<br>
<br>
So like 5 minutes after that Kelewala is /telling me with an apology saying I'm sorry it was an accident sometimes we hit at the exact same time, I was just assisting the puller. Bitter about the situation I declined.<br>
<br>
Few days later he /tells me again. I decline it still and he flips. <br>
<br>
Nght in Velks, get OOC arguement then comes to /tells, the logs. Next day he thinks I am still bluffing and tries caling me out, I tell him shut the fuck up or I will post it. week later, same issue. He gets to the point of thinking I donm't have it and am bluffing. The other night he bitches all night about people taking top ledge pulls, because his group was pulling way below top ledge. All groups where doign it, hey he wanted to pull other crap and claim what was his. Oh well. Well he calls me out again, I take him up on it and post it.<br>
<br>
What I don't get if he was playing ihs enchanter and mezzed it as well, why would he try scaring me away with the GM crap, then apologize later saying he was just assisting the puller, which was him in the first place. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ukelewala.showPublicProfile?language=EN>kelewala</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 151<br> <font color=#E9D756>(8/19/01 5:40:18 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: here ya go..</span><hr size=1> Yes, the pally had just joined, and I'm glad it went to a friend. But we had been doing group random on good drops, If i recall that was the first good drop you were present for (3 hours is still new to group when we'd been there for most of the day). Prior to you joining group was talking about how nbg was abused and how everyone was nescessary to make a hunt succesful, etc. If you hadnt started the name calling I dont think you would have been told off (you are another good reason not to group with strangers). But you pitched a fit, instead of just letting us vote. (vote ended up NBG) At the time I was anti-nbg just because I'd seen so many assholes win a lammy, sell it, and be right back in on random the next time (I've never randomed on a lammy or rbg btw, never owned either, seen alot drop tho). NBG can be abused, and is abused at Necro.   <p>Kelewala Kinderwolf (Chauffeur to the Stars)
