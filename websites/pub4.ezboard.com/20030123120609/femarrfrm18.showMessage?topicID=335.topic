Instead of leading an all-out war against those whose express goal was to murder innocent Americans, he wasted precious time and resources fighting with federal prosecutors, federal courts, and the Republican Congress- over sins and crimes he had committed.<br>
<br>
Our enemis have not been distracted or softened by the allure of modern liberalism, feel-good feminism, or radical environmentalism.  They are not distracted from their murderous mission by absurd notions of political correctness.  They are focused.  They are fearless.  They are disciplined.  And they will pay any price to advance their jihad- until they win, or die. Period.<br>
<br>
Just months after September 11th, liberal politicians and opinionmakers were already seeking to tie President George Bush's hands by publicly announcing their opposition to a much-needed increase in defense spending and demanding &quot;endgame&quot; strategies for a war whose end could not now be known.  And they did this while our courageous servicemen and women were defending our country on the battlefields and in the caves of Afghanistan and elsewhere.<br>
<br>
The left may be sincere, but they&quot;re sincerely wrong.  And they must be challenged and defeated in we are to win this war on terror and preserve our way of life for this and future generations.<br>
<br>
Far too many liberals see no connection between values, education, the moral health of our nation, and America's security and prosperity.  And that's precisely the problem.<br>
<br>
So, too, it's time for those who disparage and dismiss the importance of faith, family, and the flag in our lives to be held to account.  Liberals preach that there is nothing wrong with American education that more money and social engineering can't solve.  They teach our children multiculturalism rather than American culturem revisionist history rather than American history, the thinly disguised religion of secular humanism and extreme environmentalism rather than capitalism.  They train our young to criticize America, not celebrate it.  They welcome condoms into the classroom but ban God and the Ten Commandments.  They encourage tolerance for the teachings of the Koran but not for the teachings of Jesus Christ.  They oppose the Pledge of Allegiance, tell us that &quot;God is dead,&quot; that &quot;Christianity is for losers,&quot; and that evangelical and Catholic conservatives are more dangerous than radical Islamic militants.  They tell us that fuel-burning SUVs are bad for America, but flag-burning SOBs aren't.  But they are wrong.  And it is time to ask: why, particularly in time of war, should we entrust the education of our children to people who loathe and ravage so many of our core values and traditions?<br>
<br>
Let me be clear: Liberal ideas are not responsible for the terrorist attacks of September 11th, 2001.  They are, however, responsible for making America more vulnerable, for creating confusion in our society and among our children about what is right and wrong, and thus for palcing our freedom and security at risk.  Please understand that I'm not saying that liberals like Bill Clinton, Al Gore, Tom Daschle, and Dick Gephardt and many of elitist in academia and the media are evil.  I'm saying they have a disturbing habit of winking at evil- of ignoring it, or turning a blind eye to it.  And in so doing, they put us all in jeopardy.<br>
<br>
Liberal Democrats- many of whom historically criticized, attacked, and sought to defund the CIA- at first showed little interest in an investigation of the roots of this massive intelligence failure.  It was only after they smelled political advantage that they began to jump on the bandwagon.<br>
<br>
The Times story revealed that &quot; in 1996, a State Department dossier spelled out Mr. bin Laden's operation and his anti-American intentions.  But Clinton chose not to act.  The Times even quoted former Clinton senior advisor George Stephanopolous admitting that the Clinton-Gore administration never gave much attention to protecting the American people from bin Laden and his ilk, despite the growing number of deaths on innocent Americans at the hands of al Qaeda operatives.<br>
<br>
&quot;It wasn't the kind of thing where you walked into a staff meeting and people asked,  what are we doing today in the war against terrorism?&quot; said Stephanopolous.<br>
<br>
To which i ask: why not?<br>
Why were issues like gays in the military and global warming and promoting race-based set-asides more important to the Clinton-Gore administration than waging a war against terrorism?<br>
<br>
As time passes, other Clinton-Gore advisers and supporters are going on the record to describe just how uninterested the president and vice president really were in defending American citizens from the terrorist threat.<br>
<br>
Dick Morris points out that President Clinton- known for his unctuous phrase &quot; I feel your pain&quot;- never visited the site of the 1993 World Trade Center attack, in which six people died and more than one thousand were injured.  Clinton didn't even meet privately with the director of the Central Intelligence Agencry for two years following that attack.<br>
<br>
Even after a bomb exploded at the 1996 Atlanta Olympic Games, and ninteen American soldiers died in the bombing of a U.S. military barracks in Saudi Arabia, Morris says that President Clinton &quot; seemsed curiously uninvolved in the battle against terror.&quot;  Sandy Berger, then President Clinton's deputy national security adviser,&quot; seemed to work overtime at opposing tough measures against terror,&quot; says Morris.  According to Morris, Berger advised Clinton to veto a bill designed to cripple Iranian funding terrorism by mandating American retaliation against companies that aided its oil industry.  Berger said Clinton should only sign the bill if a provision were added to it authorizing the president to waive the retaliatory santions.  And Morris observes that, when the bill eventually passed with the waiver provision, Berger blocked the imposition of sanctions almost every time.<br>
<br>
In addition, Morris notes, Stephanopolous and Deputy Chief of Staff Harold Ickes lobbied Clinton against approving a measure that would have forced aliens' driver's licenses to expire with their visas- which would have meant that routine traffic stops could trigger deportation proceedings. The bill would have resulted in the interfacing of state motor vehicle records with FBI and INS data concerning illegal alieans, visa expirations, and terrorist watch lists.  But ickes and Stephanopolous opposed it because it could be viewed as racial profiling, thereby alienating Clinton's political base.  If the bill had passed, Morris concludes hauntingly, hijacker Mohammed Atta might have been deported when he was cited for driving without license several months before September 11.  To make matters worse, neither President Clinton nor Vice President Gore did much to fight for stronger airline security, desipite the rising terrorist threat.  Clinton essentially ignored recommendations to require x-ray screening for baggage, to restore air marshals to commercial flights, and to federalize air security checkpoints.  Similarly , Gore did nothing to implement these suggestions when his commission on Air Safety issued its recommendations in 1997.  Only after September 11, obeserved Morris, were there any of these initiatives instituted.<br>
<br>
Clinton was apparently so afraid of being accused of racially profiling Islamic charities that he even refused to create a list of extremist and terrorist organizations along with their members and donors in order to alert the public to the possiblility of donations that might further terrorism.<br>
<br>
&quot;Everything was more important to clinton than fighting terrorism,&quot; says Morris. &quot; Political correctness, civil liberties concerns, fear of offending the administration's supporters, Janet Reno's objections, considerations of cost, worries about racial profiling, and the second term, surviving impeachment, all came before fighting terrorism.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Frankly, i don't think we're handling this war on terrorism in the correct way, &quot;Moore objected. &quot;What did we have two hundred FBI agents doing three or four years investigating the president's zipper? Seriously, think about this.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Not his zipper,&quot; I shot back, &quot;His lying under oath, just to remind you- his lying.  He put his hand on the Bible, Michael.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Let's see,&quot;Moore snapped back.&quot; His lying under oath?  Or would i rather have had two hundred FBI agents finding the terrorists who were planning to kill three thousand people?<br>
<br>
Clever, Michael, oh so clever.  Just on problem.  It turns out that we didn't need two hundred FBI agents tracking down the terrorist mastermind.  Sudan actually offered Osama bin Laden to Clinton- Gore administration on a silver platter back in 1996.  Before he bombed our embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.  Before he attacked the USS Cole.  Before thousands of Americans died on September 11, 2001. But the Clinton-Gore administration repeatedly turned down Sudan's offer and in doing so let Osama bin Laden slip away to unleach an epoc of evil against us.<br>

Catching Ossama is not going to make a difference, would not have made a difference and will not be making any difference. Ossama didn't drop bomb one on the U.S. He recruited people who so hated America that they would die to do this.  People are taking it up the stinkhole in thirdworld countries for years now because of fukked up foriegn policy. Look its not Vietnam, or Communists, or any of the other people we have waged real war with, its the people who's life, liberty and futures we have destroyed that are coming back at us ten fold. Blame Bill, blame the liberals, blame the media, blame whoever the @#%$ you want, but until we learn to put the blame squarely on those who assume the mantle of responsibility will we ever have a chance of undoing the web of loathe we've woven ourselves into. <br>
<br>
We have allowed our business to try to be diplomatic ties and they have been greedy and destructive to the very democracy we were once sworn to uphold. Well, if big business wants to take our money overseas they can damn well deal with the governments over their without our state sponsered interference. Imagine if our unions were broke by the Germans and Brits what lengths we would have gone too. That's also the problem, people have forgotten that Americans died fighting for workers' rights in America at the hands of Americans. We went through painfull growing periods in our developement as a nation. Now like some post grad 20 year old we assail the world with our adulthood and the many lessons we've learned to try to pull our adolescent neighbor girl through her tough times, but the rest of the world just sees this as some desperate dork trying to get an easy piece. <br>

Hehehe, you know a President has done a real good job when his opposition hates him so much that even a couple of years later after he has left office the diatribes against him read just as they did when he was in office. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Seriously, can a reasonable person think that Clinton was so busy getting blow jobs and finding ways to allude justice or otherwise promote his personal interests that the enemies of the US grew stronger? Strong enough to attack us? PLLLLEEASE! That is surely far fethced.<br>
<br>
Matters of domestic policy do not detract a government from persuing foreign policy. It is my experience that the &quot;Hawks&quot; of the US government usually find some reason to complain that not enough weapons are being built, and that there is not enough men and women in uniform, to protect our borders from the &quot;threat outside&quot;.<br>
<br>
What the Hawks fail to understand is that the new threat can't be eliminated by force. The US is not hated because we are the most wealthy nation in the world. We are not hated because of our Repulican form of Democracy. We ARE hated because of our foreign policy.<br>
<br>
We are hated because more often than not we use our military might to enforce our foreign agenda. Are you a stark raving lunetic of a dictator in Honduras, but give US mulitnational corporations free reign of your resources? Guess, what? You have the full support of the Unted States Marines! SO, when Juan Freedom-lover puts together a group of rebels to oust you, just have an aid ring up your contact in the CIA and a couple executives of some of the US corporations in your country and you will have 1,000 Marines instanly on your shores putting down the big bad &quot;drug pushing&quot; rebels! That's right, the US Predident will handle the press ensuring that your dictatorship is legititmized and that your rebels look like drug peddling whores!<br>
<br>
We will then see the President put on name on this plan. Catchy names like &quot;Plan Columbia&quot;. It doesn't matter if the President is Republican or Democrat. It just matters who has control of congress. You see, which ever party controls congress will decide how long a President can go implementing policy to support those corporate donations to his re-election campaign. If Democrats control congress and the President is of the opposition, then that President will have a very short leash, and vice versa. But when a President has a congress of his same party... look out! We had better hope that that President is a King Arthur and not a Mordrid!<br>
