You morons, if you are going to @#%$ vote down taxes you have NO RIGHT to complain that your house burns down because the city couldn't afford a few new fire engines!

I live in alaska.  Here, the state gives you money for just living here.  Thats right, if your lazy ass is sitting in our state, our government will come to your house and plop down a check for ~$1800 every year.  Guess what, our economy is in the shits.  We can't afford teachers, we can't afford to pump water to fight fires, we can't afford police, we can't afford road repairs, we can't afford snowplowing (we use a lot in Alaska) and people complain.  Yet when a group of smart men (Democrats) proposed to take away a small portion ($500 per person, leaving $1300 still) this free money that the state just mails to your house, people whined bitched and complained, and the ballot measure failed.  And now guess what?  THEY COMPLAIN ABOUT EVERY GODDAM THING THATS WRONG!<br>
<br>
Someone tell me what type of personality finds this logical?  Someone tell me who thinks this normal?  If someone acted like this to my face (I can't even think of a normal situation that would arise to make an analogie), i'd laugh and raise taxes anyway.<br>

If my taxes were raised by $500 annually, even $1000 annually, I wouldn't mind IF I saw a difference.<br>
<br>
The problem with taxes is that they always go up, and budgets always get cut... so if they get more money and spend less... where does it go?<br>
<br>
I know... its how government works.  You give them $1000 and hope that $200 goes to programs that are useful.  Doesn't have to mean I like it.<br>
<br>
Personally unemployment makes me angry.  People can collect money for sitting home and doing nothing.  Before anyone tells me some sad story about their dad, their husband, or their sister who had to collect unemployment... I am NOT talking about them.  I am talking about people who purposely wait as long as they can before even looking for a job, taking advantage of the time limit.  I support making them work for the state cleaning highways or something similar to collect their checks.  Talk about a decrease in how long it takes them to get a job... the money you saved there alone would do well to pay teachers. <p><img src=http://www.mindspring.com/~cnjmorris/catcen.jpg>

<br>
Um....That money comes out of thin air, right?  No.  It comes from all the other citizens of this country that don't even live in your state.  Your complaint that people are whining is laughable in that it's NOT YOUR MONEY IN THE FIRST PLACE!.<br>
<br>
I agree with the other comments here, in that if I could see a difference, I would gladly have taxes increased.  But we don't.  Ever.  Where does the tax increase go?  Oh, wait... It goes to the same place as the Federal surplus did.  No, the surplus didn't disappear because Bush voted in a tax rebate for us (And if you truly believe that that was a rebate, you haven't caught on yet), but because we are spending BILLIONS more on arrant BS again this year.<br>
<br>
Spend my hard earned money for real improvements, and I'll gladly contribute.  Spend it enhancing the lives of corrupt politicians, and I have to take issue with it.<br>

Over a year ago, I collected unemployment.  I didn't have to look for a job, because no one was really checking up on me.  All I had to do was mark a check box that said that I looked for full time work that week.  That's it, no other verification needed to get my check.  Personally, I think you should be given so many vouchers a week and they should be signed by people you've interviewed with.  These could be followed up by a phone call to the prospective employer, to make sure the signature is valid.  Failure to turn in the required number of vouchers would result in you not getting a check for that week.  It's much too easy to just sit back and leech off unemployment, although I don't know how anyone could live off it. <p>Wildane Crazywolf<BR>53 Shaman<BR><BR>"I will take love wherever I find it and offer it to everyone who will take it, seek knowledge from those wiser, and teach those who wish to learn from me" - Duane Allman</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/bemarr.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=trevalyns>TrevalynS</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 86<br> <font color=#E9D756>(8/21/02 5:34:05 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3569.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Question about unemployment...</span><hr size=1> I had always thought unemployment was paid by the company that got rid of you?<br>

<br>
And I agree with Parum.  People are stupid and shortsighted.  They want everything to be given to them, and don't want to pay for anything.  Folks in LA constantly bytch about the schools (which really suck).  But they vote down every bond measure, parents refuse to get involved with their childrens school, and they accept every crazy ass new theory of teaching regardless of whether there is any evidence to suggest it is actually good. <p>-- The <select><option>SOB</option><option>Grump</option><option>Bastard</option><option>pwner of Chiteng</option></select> formerly known as Raedwulf</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uavividoriya.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Avivi Doriya</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#E9D756>(8/21/02 6:55:33 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3569.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Question about unemployment...</span><hr size=1> Sorry, I have to respectfully disagree with the first post in this thread.  I just can't side with one who wants to raise taxes yet again when there's not much more of my paycheck left to give.  Every year it seems I'm paying more in and getting back less, and programs just keep being cut.  If I thought it would actually make a difference, then yes, I would be all for it.  But instead what I see is myself working my butt off paying for my own full time college with a crappy night job while someone else is sitting on their ass collecting a paycheck, or a member of congress voting themselves yet another pay raise.  Also the wealthy who are paying the very same rate I am, how fair is that?<br>
<br>
   It's astonishing to see just how little of our taxes go to much needed programs.  Using the military as an example, you'd be surprised what they actually get paid for putting their lives on the line for the government and protecting all of us 24/7, its very very little.  The government doesn't seem to think that their lives are worth that much.  The very same people who pay them take money back with taxes.  Now some are fighting overseas while their families are forced to make ends meet with foodstamps, but yet Congress seems to find enough money lying around to vote themselves a 15 percent raise this year.  The fault doesn't lie in the people not wanting to vote for higher taxes, the fault lies in our own corrupt politicians.  The truth is, sadly, that they will continue to do so because we let them.  That's why no one should vote for higher taxes.  Your hard earned dollars are going into the pockets of the rich.<br>

The rich have more funds to draw from than I do, therefore should be paying a higher rate.  I make just enough to survive, there isn't anymore one could take from me without having to make some serious setbacks and sacrifices, affecting not just me, but my family.  Whereas the rich would still live comfortably even paying twice as much as I do.  There are some who have more money than they could ever spend.<br>

I am not rich by the way but any system in which one is punished for being successful is a messed up system. The top 5% of the wage earners in America pay 55% of all the taxes. The bottom 15% pay none. Guess who is stuck paying the rest? Us &quot;middle class&quot;. Is that fair? People who don't pay any taxes get refunds!! Even better when I got my tax rebate last year, there were people who had not paid taxes that were bitching about not getting one. Thats unfair. <p>Flubbin<br>

You act like every who's rich won the lotto and they didn't work their ass off for what they have.<br>

If you don't think someone who invents a world changing product or someone who entertains millions of people should be getting more pay than someone who scrubs the toilets in an old gas station on a broken down highway, then you sure wouldn't like this &quot;capitalism&quot; system we tend to be using these days.

As far as the whole tax thing.....yes it would be great if our taxes actually went to what they were supposed to goto, unfortunatly until government gets it's priorities straight it is going to suck.  Alaska pays you to live there?  to me that is messed up in the first place. ..  what the hell is up with that?<br>

But no its from the oil revenue, since its 'the peoples land' they get paid for it... same deal in Texas except we have a much higher population, so we just don't have to pay state income tax... our oil revenue funds that. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/bemarr.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=razer>Razer</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 195<br> <font color=#E9D756>(8/21/02 12:41:07 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3569.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> wow, this post reminds me of everquest :P<br>

<br>
And the points about taxes going up and services not being noticed to go up is good.  But consider it more like taxes going up to fill the hole, so they cut less.<br>
