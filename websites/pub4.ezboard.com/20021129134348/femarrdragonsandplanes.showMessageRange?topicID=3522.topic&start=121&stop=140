Iwantloot, err Ironloot, the mind is a terrible thing to waste. And yes you and Gonadax promised to help my cleric get her scroll, which she has now btw. (Thansk Iwka, Westleey and Apocalyptic Aftermath). Lets refresh your memory. You had no rogue to do chardok. You interrupt my fun to request Badwala's help. I leave my exp group and help you (what a nightmare, anyone would rather have a root canal than listen to &quot;Loot&quot; rant and rave during a raid). Before I come I make it clear I expect help from RE for Thisosa. You agree. You have a succesful raid because of Badwala, I get nothing but an empty promise.  <br>
<br>
Then you break your second promise. RE is doing Plane of Air. Again you interrupt my fun with a request for an enchanter. I log Wammbamm. you get 3 crowns, I  get nothing but another empty promise to help Thisosa and a headache from your fat mouth. GRATS to my friend Saphael on magician epic. tho! Only reason I stayed was Saph, I was ready to walk away after 5 minutes. (Can you say &quot;cluster @#%$&quot; boys and girls?)<br>
<br>
Needless to say over the course of the next 6 months or so, everytime I asked for help or RE was raiding the Chardok Royals I was told &quot;sorry cant help you&quot;.  Surprisingly they kept asking for my help on raids (Have you no shame?). After months of getting brushed off, I explained to friends why I wouldnt join RE. I mentioned their broken promises and my friends in RE evidently brought it up in guildchat. Porndax and Ironpoot said some very nasty things in guildchat I'm told. But this is when Ironass and Gonadax first denied to me they had made any promises. Then the name calling and threats started and I walked away from it. <br>
<br>
I really had no plans of writing this up. but you two have screwed over so many other people, its time everyone knew. I mean come on, calling Barrymore and Chamcham thieves and liars? Spreading malicious lies about them? This can't be allowed. I've had too many dealings with you and them to have any doubt who is in the wrong here.     <br>
<br>
BTW Who is the auditor for RE? anyone? Where does all the money and loot go? Like the extra mage epic crowns from when I helped you? And do you still insist on being in the exp group on raids gorn and iron? (what kind of leaders ALWAYS structure groups so they get the exp for every mob?)<br>
<br>
Moral of the story: Gorndax and Ironlute will promise you anything to get what they want.<br>

I'm pretty amazed that you still hold a grudge.  So, considering most of this is out of line hopefully I can clear things up some.<br>
<br>
The raid where we went to do royals were I requested a rogue was because we worked down to the prince door to find out that we didnt have a rogue.  You invited a friend who didnt have lockpicking up and so you left the raid with thisosa and brought in your rogue.  You told me to came to get a cleric scroll and I said I would make sure you'd be in on it.  There was never any promise to get you a cleric scroll.  I would never say that I promise someone I they would recieve an item because they were on a raid.  In honesty, I cant even remember if we got down to king and killed him since there were about 2-3 chardok raids that ended in servers crashing and one that ended up with walling a mob and having him summon us to death heh.<br>
<br>
There was only one time we were up in Sky together.  It was the time that Charmian got her epic crown.  Ironlute was doing groups and you threatened to jump off unless you had your group some way.  We only got one crown, and a friend of yours invited you.  I wasnt in sky either when Safael got her crown, or nerodread.  Therefore, saying I promised you something during this is false.<br>
<br>
Every time RE went to chardok you sent me a tell &quot;telling&quot; me that you were coming for your note.  I repedivately told you that I never promised you a note.  Why would I promise 1 cleric out of 3 or more that they would get a note?  Why if anyone offered their help would they expect to receive something?  Its pretty outrageous.  <br>
<br>
I never said any &quot;names&quot; about you in guild chat other than that I wouldnt have you on a raid because you expected I promised you something.  You however come up with little games of changing our names around heh.<br>
<br>
Oh and lastly:<br>

I have almost never run an event for Ironlute or myself.  The only events you are familiar with are Chardok and Sky, both that hold nothing for either of us.  In fact, we were helping friends which is what we always do.  Only thing that happened is you didnt get what you want so this occurred.<br>

Ristius:  The only reason you dont like me is because I had you and your brother removed from Champions of Marr due to your childish and preverted acts.  Your acts were not suited in a guild of adults.  Thats the only reason you would post here.

Barrymore:  You continue to post only to have this bumped.  We tried to end this weeks ago, so, let it drop.  BTW, if you really followed the charter you helped build for RE you wouldnt still be wearing the robe or the staff I gave you.  Actually, Im still upset that I was the only one in guild that thought you should have the robe (everyone else said I was caving in) and you attack me about it.  <br>

<br>
I helped make Radiant Eclipse; you guys wanted me, as Chamcham, because I was a very well known level 60 enchanter.  You figured, hey, if you have a very well known and popular level 60 enchanter that'll attract a lot of new members to join the guild.<br>
<br>
Time went by... I was hanging with a friend who was, at the time, in Anam Kara and was really considering joining them at the time.  So I talked with the folks there, disbanded, joined them, got a load of bitching at from Ironlute like &quot;Why don't you care about me?  You don't care about anyone, you just up and leave, whaaaa!&quot;  So I felt really bad, disbanded from Anam Kara and joined back up with Radiant Eclipse.<br>
<br>
Time went by some more... being told to come to location A-B-C-D or else as my enchanter.  Ironlute complainy about the members of Radiant Eclipse not liking her and not treating her like a top notch queen since she's an officer, and recently I had just went AFK in West Karana looking down and had Auto Run on, came back thirty minutes later, dead Zelgadis.  I asked the guild for help, Ironlute just told me to go to hell, like &quot;Even though I'm your friend, there's others in the guild who can help, I'm not a port whore.  Its your own fault you died, I'm not helping.&quot; So I went wandering around Velious looking for a teleport back to the Karanas, and at the time Radiant Eclipse was forming up a raid to some place, too, and they were like &quot;Bring Chamcham now, Zelgadis.&quot; and I was like &quot;Sorry, no Zelgadis corpse, no Chamcham.&quot;  Well, after a while my brother and his guild at the time came down and helped me out.  Some friend Ironlute was.  I mean, she was always bitchy and threatening people about asking her for teleports, never got her TL spells either.  Not saying that its a necessity to get it, but if you asked her for help then you'd get a &quot;......................................&quot; from her.  Anyway, where was I... I'm running around Wakening Lands and Ironlute's all complaining that she's not getting respect that she deserves as an officer, and I bump up like &quot;You should follow your own rules, I mean, you just said we're members of the same guild and we should help each other, but why didn't you help me back there?&quot; and I got a /guildremoved by her.  Then I told her she was a cursed little witch and her life would never be happy.<br>
<br>
Well, some how got back into the guild, and Gorndax was like &quot;You need to apologize to her.&quot; so I did.  But then in the middle of a Kael raid Ironlute was like &quot;You know I thought I was told you were supposed to make a public apology to me!&quot; and I was like &quot;Hell no, I've apologized enough.&quot;<br>
<br>
Time goes on, we raid, we kill, Ironlute throws bigger fits, she fights with Gorn, she moves onto me sexually, I try telling her that its not friggin right, but hey, she can't go on two minutes without sex.  I remember her complaining right after Gorndax would leave, she'd be like &quot;Damn, I need sex.  I'm so horny I'm going to jump the next guy I see.&quot;  Well, Gorn didn't like that, and he wouldn't get the picture that she was doing the main moving, and I was being a friendly friend who had become semi-perverted from hanging around her, because that's what kind of person she is and looks for.<br>
<br>
More time goes by, and at around, what, April, I decide that I'm not able to do anything at all in my own decision in this game.  If I try to I'd get a &quot;Whaaa, no one cares about me, I'm going to shoot myself, you don't like me, Gorndax hate me, whaaaa!&quot; from Ironlute.  In fact I remember sitting down in Skyfire near OT one night with Ironlute and Gorndax as we were headed for Howling Stones for a group, and she stops us in our tracks after a loooooong AFK and starts bitching both of us out for no reason.  Guess she had some odd long talk with her mother that made her want to tell all guys to go to hell and we're the source of all evil.  Man, that made me feel like such a pile of crap, all the stuff she said I never thought I would ever do, but I haven't.  But because it was said by her it had to be true, or else she'd argue and guilt trip some more.<br>
<br>
Anyway, so I quit the game.  I'm hanging around returning my stuff at the last moment and Radiant Eclipse is going up to Hate to try killing Innoruuk and Ironlute goes &quot;You should have killed a god before you quit, dork.&quot; and I was like &quot;Well, how about my RBB?  Is it going to ever be returned?&quot; and she said &quot;Lol, Gorndax told me that he never wanted you to have it back.  But how about you just tell everyone that you don't want it back and you'll give it to the person who the original random went to.&quot;  and that really really pissed me off, right there.  So I went online and sent Gorndax a tell like &quot;The hell is with you?  Why did you use me and steal my items?&quot; and he was all like &quot;What, I never said any of that.&quot;  What happened with the RBB was, well, it was on an old Gorndax Vox raid, I was coming with Zelgadis but he was like &quot;We need Chamcham here for buffs.&quot; so I brought her to help with buffs.  This was way before Radiant Eclipse, too.  Buffed up, logged out, came back in, killed Vox, dropped that caster mask and the melee belt.  So I was like &quot;Hey Gorndax, could I have a shot with Chamcham on the mask, but if I get it I won't be on the melee belt?' and he said &quot;No, Chamcham didn't fight, that would be unfair.&quot;  So it was randomed, melee belt came up, I said I'd be in for random, my name was at the very end of the list, though, and Gorndax did a /random of everyone minus my number.  So he went &quot;Oops.&quot; and rerandomed the belt, and my number came up.  I recieved the belt.<br>
<br>
Some how this became &quot;Chamcham is a loot whore, he was complaining about not being in on both rolls, he wanted both items, and he complained for a rerandom with his number didn't come up the first time on the RBB.&quot;  ... whatever.  I let their level 60 main tank borrow the belt a few times for their raids, but after their VS rotation entry raid I never got it back, after I offered to let them use it and they were like &quot;Yes, log Zel on and let us use it.&quot; ... nothing with a please, or a thank you, or any of that.  Couple weeks after that VS raid in January I decided that I'd start working on my ranger epics, and I was hoping that this would give the guild the idea that I wanted to play my ranger, not Chamcham.  But it didn't.  I had to play Chamcham for every piece of the epic line... except for, what, East Karana and VSR, which neither had any enchanters... because I WAS THE ENCHANTER!!  if I hadn't played Chamcham through City of Mist, The Hole, Plane of Hate, I wouldn't have any of the parts.  But when I was about done with the epics all of the Radiant Eclipse officers jumped on me in IMs and /tells like &quot;You know, if you finish Zel's epics you'll have to hand down your RBB to Korarlei.  He doesn't have any haste after all.&quot;  And I was like &quot;But what if I want to sell that belt for something new?&quot; and they were like &quot;Well this will only be temorary, until you leave or we get him a replacement or upgrade haste.&quot;  Time goes by... I ask for my belt returned several times, and they back away half way across the world and give me this low down guilting speech until I just give up out of frusteration for the day.  One time I was like &quot;I want my belt back, then I'm leaving.&quot; so they went to Sirens Grotto like &quot;There's a haste belt just like the RBB that drops in SG, we're going to get it and then give your RBB back, doesn't that make you happy you greedy little prick?&quot;  Well, later on I got really mad, really heated, just gave up for that time and told them... and just about instantly ported out to another raid.<br>
<br>
Well, when I quit, couple weeks after, I saw they had got another RBB off a Kunark dragon.  I remember being told if they get another RBB they'd return mine.  I was going to sell the RBB since I quit to a RL friend who also played EQ for some real money.  But when I posted on the RE boards I got &quot;You can just screw off Cham.&quot; and then I was banned.  I can't even view any of the RE website or message board because of that now.  I don't know how I can post on your message board anymore about all that you've done to me if I'm banned, can't see, can't talk, can't do anything.  Funny thing is, only Gorndax and Ironlute seem to be the only two who recognize that I'm banned from the guild.  I wasn't quietly removed, I was forcefully rejected and cussed out.<br>
<br>
Time passes.  I get rather angry when ever I was reminded of the RBB, but things calm down, I get bored and decide to come back into EQ.  I see Korarlei pass me, that level 60 warrior from RE who has my belt, in Sebilis along with the rest of the guild.  I send him a tell asking for my RBB back and he says &quot;Dude, your brother gave this to me as a gift.&quot;, and I think... that's not right, that's not what my brother said.  And then Korarlei disappears for a few more weeks.<br>
<br>
I started clearing out my bank of all the old junk.  My friends were right, I was a big pack rat, and I must have made 800-some platinum from a vender for selling off all my crap.  But I had some no drop quest items laying around.  A phinny spine for the bard epic, Thurgadin chain bracer I got from a Kael pick up raid, Unadorned chain bracer from back in RE in ToV, and a J-Boots ring.  So I decided to post these items up on auction.  Not too soon after I get a message from Ironlute asking me to talk to her about that.  That was strange, just the other day she said she never wanted to talk to me again (see my first post in this thread, thats why).  Skitzo, my friend said.  Well I talk, hoping for something good and not unpleasant and she goes &quot;I want you to return that unadorned chain bracer back to us.  You thief.&quot; and I was like &quot;Well, only if you return my RBB.&quot;  Then she burst out and started yelling at me, calling me a greedy loot whore and what not, blah blah, well, she told me to go to hell and put me on ignore again.<br>
<br>
Next day I see Korarlei on again, I send him a tell and he says to go to Dreadlands.  So I get a TL out of my exp group, go to Dreadlands, and he says &quot;So and so will give it to you.&quot; and I'm like &quot;Why does he have it and not Korarlei?&quot;  But I get the belt back, I'm happy.  I go by my word and return the SS Chain Bracer to the person requested (demanded) by Radiant Eclipse.<br>
<br>
Couple weeks later, close to today, I auction the Phinny Spine.  One again I'm told to talk with them about the item, except this time around I have to talk with Gorndax.  He goes &quot;You just don't get it, you made a deal with us for your epics, the belt wasn't even yours.  We gave your item back, now you give ours back.&quot; and here I'm thinking &quot;Oh, big Gorn who thinks he's so rough and tough because he has friends in Affliction. Korarlei gave the belt back, Ironlute and Gorndax just got really mad and angrivated because i did.&quot; and I go &quot;Sorry, no deal.  I'm only selling this for 10k pp, not giving it to you for free.  Not after all the stuff you put me through.&quot;  He calls me names, I point out that he's engaged to a slut.  Dicussion over, just like the one with Ironlute.<br>
<br>
I can write up whole stories about this and could go on forever.  But basically that's the full real version of what Gorndax said in his tiny paragraph, from my point of view.  I don't think I should abide by any of RE's demands since Gorndax and Ironlute banned me from the guild, I should not return any more free items and get used and abused.<br>
<br>
Now please leave me alone, I got my belt back, I'm happy, no more quarrels with Gorndax and Ironlute.  You've already invaded my auction post trying to make me look bad.<br>

<br>
The mistake was having the conversation in /say but since I've know Cham so long I didn't think much of it at the time. Seems that many people shared the same opinion of Ironlute because what I heard was along the lines of &quot;Just ignore her Cham, she's an idiot&quot;<br>
<br>
I knew Cham was unhappy with the situation and I knew he had good friends in AK. I tried to persuade him a dozen times that this loyalty was misguided but he stuck it out for other RE members. I promise you that.<br>

Anyway Cham. I know you gave it your best. If your looking for a guild of friends you can always pop me a tell.<br>

<br>
What the fuc<!>k happened to simply understanding what is going on, maybe realizing you fuc<!>ked up and figuring out a solution to the problem. But that would be too much to ask of the ignorant people that cry this nonsense in the first place, if they had enough intelligence to understand the explanation they would have come to the same conclusion themselves.<br>
<br>
I am sure these same dumb asses will read this and think that I am saying that no one is a loot whore and that is never the reason for some one to leave, obviously there are loot whores, and they have guild hopped to get new stuff many times. I do not agree with what they do and do not condone it, but what I hate to see is good people being called names that they are not in the slightest.<br>
<br>
In short...<br>
<br>
Shut the fuc<!>k up you whiny ass close minded idiots and pay some fuc<!>king attention to what is going on around you, you will see many of the problems before they occur, and you will notice that many of the people you bad mouth have very valid points and are not leaving for selfish reasons. <br>

gorn,<br>
 <br>
No grudge. Just sharing some of what I've seen of the Gorndax/Ironlute horror show.  <br>
<br>
You are right in one thing though, you didnt name call. That was Ironlute. You did however evade, deny, not recollect and... promise to check logs.<br>
<br>
Let me see, it was the 2nd time I came to Chardok to help you I brought my ROGUE.  I was NOT there already. I never brought a friend without lockpick. I was in another zone exp'ing. I wasn't even playing my rogue when you called for help.  <br>
<br>
My first time I did play my cleric and druid, perhaps thats why you remember Thisosa being in Chardok. <br>
<br>
The 2nd chardok raid, as with every RE raid I'd attended, you had designated who was getting what before it started.  But I did extract a promise from you that your guild would help Thisosa at another time .  If you hadn't promised, I wouldn't have come. Because by this time I was done with you. <br>
<br>
  I'd already been to plane of growth, kael arena and chardok royals with your guild. Early on,  I'd considered joining your guild. BUT on every raid Ironlute was so whiney, bitchy, and bossy, and loot was so arbitrarily dispersed, and you constantly built groups so you'd get every bit of exp, I never applied. <br>
<br>
&quot;Ahh&quot; you say, &quot;but how do i know you are an exp whore?' Well, on one raid your group was the 3 deadliest melee, the highest level cleric and the two of you. Other groups had 1 or 2 melee if any. My group had 2 shamans, an enc, cleric, and 2 druids. although, we lost a druid when we got a few kills.  Anyway my good friend was the cleric in your group and he told me that ironlute had DEMANDED you change a group that was getting kills. I doubt she meant that to be in groupsay.    <br>
<br>
I did come all the way to chardok a 3rd time with Wammbamm when you needed an enc, but left because I was told before I came she had a chance at enc epic piece, but was told after I got there the raid was &quot;FOR&quot; someone else. dont you all just love running to chardok?<br>
<br>
As I said before, I never wanted this public, but you two keep fuckin with my friends. <br>
<br>
Please say &quot;hi&quot; to my friends in your guild. <br>
<br>
AND... I'm still waiting for the logs you promised to check. You know the ones that don't show you telling me you'd help.  <br>
<br>
PS I do apologize to readers for the name distortions, they really weren't that funny. Please feel free to attempt some humorous distortions of your own. <br>

<br>
And the first thing I can tell you and the only thing I can tell you about people like that. Put them, their alts, anyone speaking about them in a way other than negatively, and any guy that they currently have twisted around their finger on ignore. No good, none at all, can come from a woman who gets her way with sexuality and emotional swings.<br>
<br>
And I've known Chamcham awhile, I know Chamcham doesn't work well with other enchies, as par raids I've done with him, and that as far as I ever can remember is as bad as he is or was. I like the ole Cham'er and for what it's worth and I know it isn't much, I'd believe what Zel would say before someone like Ironlute, and apparently the dorf wrap-around Gorndax.<br>
<br>
And another thing! EVERQUEST AND SEX DO NOT MIX! Too many children, too many sexually depraved guys that would do anything to have hot cyberz. Sure it's all fun and games, until SOME @#%$ MASSACRE happens. Someone post that thing with the guy that commited suicide because he played EQ. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ukerryndarkwater.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kerryn Darkwater</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 2060<br> <font color=#E9D756>(8/22/02 4:19:35 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3522.topic&index=137>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: memory drugs are available over the counter.</span><hr size=1> I thought &quot;Iwantloot&quot; was pretty funny. <p><CENTER><A HREF="http://ak.lonelygamer.com">
