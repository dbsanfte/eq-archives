Really, most of us are mature enough to read normal sentences and pick out those words that describe a situation.  <br>
<br>
<br>
[q]&quot;And well AS some people that read the dragon and planes area know I am trying real hard to get to 46 so I can ATLEAST visit a plane, but Moltaenya/Ironlute Just kept saying it is only exp.&quot;[/qu]<br>
Firstly, you mentioned Molt/Ironlute in your first post only about saying that she said a raid was not about exp.  That said nothing about leadership, so yes, you lied and did not mention the leaders name in your first post.<br>
<br>
Secondly, you can not coffin summon someone not in the same zone, you being in DL because you didnt think about binding in Permafrost wont allow you to get summoned.  We used the coffins(without asking for cash btw) so we can get the monks and rogues corpse for CR.<br>
<br>
Thirdly, with all but yourself bound in zone using shout to dicate what was going on so those in the zone can communicate back to their groups is perfectly reasonable.  It was interesting how I got about 20+ consents when I shouted to the zone to tell everyone to consent me.  Any communication problems were because of your lack of initative.  If you would have asked group you probally would have known what the hell was going on.  <br>
<br>
And I really really have something to ask you here.  Yesterday, I logged into permafrost to watch a raid fail (using the see through wall in king room).  Without anyone asking myself, moltaenya and chamcham started pulling every Ice Giant pop, got consents and tried to help the raid out.  During that time I was trained, blamed because someone died among other things.  You were there right behind me as I asked for heals as I tanked three Icegiants, instead you ignored me.  You did nothing to help out out efforts in getting it so that raid can get those corpses out.  I recieved zero thanks from you or anyone else (sides Teduce, Egamerif and a necro).  The fact that you are still bitching at how lousy people we are when you went out of your way not to help people helping you... what the fuck are you thinking?  Dont play little miss Im an innocent girl that doesnt know what the hell I am doing so hold my hand &quot;WAH MOMMY WAAAAAHHHH!&quot;  Grow up.<br>
<br>
Kerna, sure you took down dragons, dont get me started here.  I never once posted or bragged about when I did them, doing it in a thread like this isnt very classy.  Good leaders are classy and respectful and dont need to brag to sway others into the fray.<br>

As pickup raids go, dragon raids are about as crazy and chaotic as it gets.  There are always a fair number of true newbies, loot whores, know it alls, and general whiners.  Sure, it would have been nice if the raid leaders could have taken the time to explain everything and make sure that everyone knew what they were doing, but that's easier said than done.  Moltie deserves respect for actually undertaking to run a dragon raid.  I sure wouldn't want to run one.<br>
<br>
By comparison, the pickup raids that Torm, Vet, and I run are nice and orderly.  Most of the people who join us are experienced raiders, and we have a core group of people who come along on a lot of our raids.  We have more time to answer questions, and a lot of the other people on the raid can tell newbies what they should be doing because they've been on our raids before.  If we're raiding a plane or a zone like The Hole, there will be a long series of fights that allow people to learn to work together as a group.  In fact, one of the most amazing things about pickup raids is watching a bunch of total strangers transform into a cohesive fighting machine over the course of a few hours.<br>
<br>
Dragon raids don't have any of those luxuries.  Sometimes things click, sometimes they don't.  When things go bad, the raid leader usually gets blamed by some of the participants.  Sometimes the raid leader deserves the blame.<br>
<br>
From what I've read in this thread, I don't see that Moltie did anything wrong other than maybe not communicating as well as she could have, and maybe losing her temper and scapegoating some people.  Given the difficulty of running a dragon raid, and the stress that goes with it, those are pretty minor sins.  It sounds to me like Moltie did a pretty good overall job of running this raid. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/umoltaenyadmagmus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Moltaenya D Magmus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 62<br> <font color=#E9D756>(9/29/01 11:19:01 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> :)</span><hr size=1> Tee hee - someone actually called me Moltie.<br>

<br>
A lot of people seemed to feel the same way.  When I logged into Perma to actually get out of there at maybe 8pm EST? I saw a bunch of raiders there asking me to lead Vox again.  I told them that I really couldn't do it because, well, it was late and we simply didn't have enough time to get the people (and hey, IF we failed again the CR would have put us late into the night again).<br>
<br>
But the fact that people *did* look beyond that bad CR was really touching.  And yes now I know what to do and what *not* to do now.<br>
<br>
And Tuasai - Zel was not a raid leader.  He was a raider.<br>
<br>
Now enough of this BS :P  I'm hoping to see that Kerna or someone finally put Vox out of her misery.  I mean, after eating so many people it must be hard for her to breath and all with her becoming so large in size :P.<br>

I'm going to guess that this was the time Chamcham charm an Ice Giant and I was oom and near death. I stated I was oom in say and OOC, cannot heal without mana, thought you knew that. I did heal you once during this battle, sorry all I could do with the mana I had. <br>
You are right, I should thank the person that helped me get my corpse, Moto, Thanks for Summoning my corpse!<br>
<br>
&quot;We used the coffins(without asking for cash btw) so we can get the monks and rogues corpse for CR&quot;<br>
<br>
Why, then were the monks I saw, also naked?<br>
<br>
&quot;If you would have asked group you probally would have known what the hell was going on.&quot;<br>
<br>
Um, I did and especially when Zel left the group, no one knew what the heck was going on and that is what got me here...no one in group and none of the leaders to ask. I asked a few people that were not in my group on my way back if they knew what was going on. they did not either.<br>

Funny, when he left there were no names in yellow, making him the group leader and since he was involved in what you talked about well why was he holding out on his own group, many of whom could not be bound in permafrost. all of which knew nothing about what was going on. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uunclegorndax.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Uncle Gorndax</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 179<br> <font color=#E9D756>(9/29/01 11:44:14 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Lousy leadership on Vox Pickup!</span><hr size=1> Tuasai, first off I made it very very clear that when I was on Gorndax.  Not once have you mentioned you tried to look for me and didnt find me.  Because you didnt, there were three raid leaders... Moltaenya, and Khaliz(backup), Myself(as archaon/gorndax) as backup.  At all times were we there.  If you didnt find Ironlute even though she shouted and made everyone possible aware then you just didnt have the capacity to look for the other two.<br>
<br>
If you saw the monks naked... then wouldnt you be in zone?  Wouldnt you have realized that the monks and rogues died numerous times trying to get corpses out?  Did you not think that is where another corpse may be?<br>

Before I stop I must say you are such an ungreatful bitch.  It really takes a lot of me to say something like that to someone as I always give people room to redeem themselves.

Tuasai said she was in FV right?  Explain to me how she could have gotten summoned without being in the zone.  Explain how once she got back to the zone why she didn't help Tistor rez so the CR could go a bit faster. (Oh and Tuasai another thing - Zel originally disbanded the group because he got zone kicked, it had been happening all night to him).<br>
<br>
50+ hell &gt; 45 hell.  Sheesh.  In the amount of time she spent whining she could have regained that exp.<br>
<br>
&quot;As for clerics looseing exp ...who do you think bind in planes and get death loops for the sake of a raid? &quot;<br>
<br>
Cham I believe meant that clerics have an easier time getting a group than most.  Oh and usually in times of trouble on a raid - I thought clerics were to DA and camp out to an alter char until it was safe to rez.  Sure there are freak cases, but I think any cleric has enough sense to /q out from those types and go to their alters.<br>

<br>
That is given ... pickup raids suck! <br>
<br>
I was pointing out the attitude behind the post ..not the fact <br>
of what went on in the game.<br>
<br>
If you actually read my post ..it was all about attitude..not some raid that went bad.<br>
<br>
I posted here because this where the original post was made.<br>
It seem relevent at the time  <p><a href="http://www.users.bigpond.net.au/redwolff/" target="_blank">

It's been another one of those days, if you know what I mean.  I don't know if I'm in one of those debating moods, but I will fill people in on some information.<br>
<br>
     Yes, Chamcham is level 60.  So what if she is.  Being level 60, or just having a level 60 character, does not mean I'm God, or a god, or any immortal figure.  I can still lose exp.  If I was caught in a death loop or couldn't get res'd after dying more than once, yes I would be pissed off.  Experience DOES matter to me when I'm really into playing the game.  If I am playing a &quot;twink&quot; and I go out to kill stuff and die, then go back to kill something and die again, and can't get back on my feet and end up with less exp than I started then yes I would be pretty moody.  Not on a raid, though.  On a raid you can expect you lose at least some exp.<br>
     On my first dragon Naggy raid when I was in Phoenix Crusaders a long time ago we were told to bind at the corner before Naggy and what ended up happening was we had a wipe out and the Fire Giants began respawning on us (it was the same day they made Naggy and Vox banish people over level 52 and MS had just been ported out), and I was stuck in a death loop, lost half of my level and the level itself.  This was also before they made the change to how long your corpse hangs around if it has nothing on it, so those 6 other itemless bodies were all gone.  Yes, I was pretty angry, but then again that was a long time ago.  I was a bit paranoid of going on another dragon raid since.<br>
     I lose bundles of experience on each raid I go on simply because there's no way around the huge agro all my spells create on my targets, and usually I don't have enough spots of something like Memory Blu so I fall back on the others while I try doing my job with monsters laying the smack down.  All in all when it's a raid you're going on, being it an experienced raid or a huge anonymous pick up raid, you can expect at least one person to die most of the time.<br>
<br>
     And Dreadwolff, if you can remember...  People above level 52 can't go on Naggy/Vox raids.  They're banished outside the zone upon agro.  My ranger was on that raid and I'm pretty serious about improving him and keeping him in fit condition.  If I see something that can upgrade that character even in the least way then I'll try getting it.  My ranger was the one that died in that raid, it was impossible for Chamcham to die there.  I lost a half bubble of experience in level 52 permanently, and so did Moltaenya, what ever level she is (I can never tell these days).  I like my ranger a lot, no matter how many stupid crude jokes people crack about them, and if anything real serious happened to it I would probably freak out like Tuasai did.<br>
     Losing some experience I could easily get back in a day or less isn't that serious to me.  If I had some kind of plan or something set in my head that was like &quot;Okay, I'm going to make so much exp today, tomorrow, and hit the next level on blah-day.&quot;, then died a whole bunch, yes I would be mad.  Upset rather.  I said that clerics could get groups easily because... it's true.  You don't see many groups in the higher levels who go around the big exp areas without one.<br>
<br>
     Tuasai, I was not a raid leader.  I was a plain raider just like you on that day.  You may think I was because I was your group leader, but the three leaders were kind of mentioned in that chat room (Moltaenya, Archaeon, Khaliz) giving out instructions for the raid.  I didn't necessarily &quot;disappear&quot;.  When I died fighting Vox my computer stopped loading at the &quot;LOADING, PLEASE WAIT...&quot;, so I had to restart.  I came back up in Thurgadin next to Dararu and Truespirit, equipped my ranger with my secondary suit (my full suit of blackened iron and my spare weapons) and some money, and I set off out of Thurgadin after saying some things to Dararu and Truespirit so I could try getting back to Permafrost again in case there was any way possible Zelgadis could help with Corpse Recovery.  If you wanted to say or ask anything of me then you should have then.  I was not given orders to look after everyone in the group that was set up with us.  All I know is my job there was simply to seek the four people out and invite them so we could get a move on and beat the hell out of things.<br>
     When I was crossing the bridge to Great Divide in Thurgadin I got a tell asking me to log on Chamcham and give Ironlute (Moltaenya) the money from earlier on from Gorndax (Archaeon).  I decided I would stay on Chamcham and get to Permafrost and help out that way with Clarity 2, Haste, Bedlam, etc since I figured I was not an important figure in that raid.  I'm sure that IF I were one of the raid leaders in the raid then I would have some sort of purpose in the raid chat or something with handing out instructions. *shrug*  The raid was fruitless to someone like me since I already have a RBB.  I actually just considered myself friendly support for Moltaenya and not a greedy suck up.  I was around when Moltaenya said &quot;Hey Gorn, Chamcham, let's try a Vox raid!&quot;, but I was not in any way a raid leader.<br>
<br>
If you really wanted to ask me what was up, you could have asked people on the raid, or people in my guild, where I moved to.  I don't give up on people, and I really feel bad if I feel I have to leave and/or ignore someone who's in dire need of help.<br>

2) shit happens.  i can assure you of this, it has happened to me<br>
<br>
3) if you dont know something about a vox raid (like where to bind), ask<br>
<br>
4) CR doesn't require coffins.  lvl 51 bard and lvl 52 cleric got an entire raiding party dragged and ressed (we were both naked) (and vox was still alive for you idiots)<br>
<br>
5) if it takes 3 hours to get something going, what do you think people are gonna do? play parcheesee? course they are gonna pull the goblins, better than pulling the dragon<br>

6) bitch all you want, but with the gimpy ass idiots that people are today, shit is always gonna happen.<br>

i've had to phsyicly tell enchanters when to tash (and when to shout), and clerics who to heal when, WHILE WE WERE FIGHTING THE FUCKING DRAGON.  again, gimpy ass idiots (not that you are one tuasai, just people in general)<br>
