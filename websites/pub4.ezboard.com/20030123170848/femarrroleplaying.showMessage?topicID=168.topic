Turning he watched as the skeleton reattached an arm it had lost during the battle.  Shaking his head at his undead minion, he sat to being his meditation.<br>
<br>
His name is Shadowedspawn.  He is a Shadow Knight.  A warrior raised from birth and taught the necromatic arts to add to his already deadly battle skills.  He mumbled a silent prayer to Innoruuk as he focused his mental abilities to recovering the mana he had used during the fight.  His mind wandered to a long ago time when he carried a different name.  Lost in concentration the sounds came to him again unbidden.  The clash of steel against steel, and the chanting of deadly magics being cast.<br>
<br>
&quot;Da'haznn!  We must flee, they are to strong for us!&quot;, cried his sister.  Scowling he turned to face her, &quot;Flee?  I would rather bed and Ogre!&quot;, he exclamied.  Grabbing her he quickly ducked behind a wall as a fearsome bolt of black energy struck where they had just been standing.  <br>
<br>
&quot;As the surviving Elder of our house I command that you leave this place!  Do not return until sufficent time has passed for this to be forgotten by our foes.  Then shall you return to strike down those responsible for this!  Then will you show them the true teachings of our Dark Father!&quot;.  She spoke a quick and quiet word of magic, concealing him in the shadows as she stepped back into open view.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Come for me now, come if you dare cowards!&quot;, she shouted across the empty square.  He watched in horror as several beams of crackling energy struck her and drew the very life force from her in that instant.  He ran then, fleeing from eniemes whose faces were forever burned into his memory.<br>
<br>
He shuddered slightly then stirring from his meditation.  Soon the day would come when he would return to avenge his fallen house.  In the long years since that fateful night he had focused all his energy on learning all that he could of magic and battle.  Learning at the hand of any that was willing to teach him, he traveled the wide lands on Norrath, and his skill grew and grew.  Standing, he banished the undead creature with a wave of his hand.  It had taken alot of money and time to find the person responsible for letting the Human scum, that had destroyed his house, into Neriak.  Now though he had a name, and soon he would come for that one, and much would be done to start the vengance he had planned.<br>
<br>
<br>
Whispering a word of magic he faded from view.  Only his dark echoing laughter remained to show that he was even there. <p><img src="http://www.100megsfree.com/caanon/PICS/SS_sig.jpg">

He had been at this for a week straight, and still he had not learned any useful information. He ended the spell with a snap of his fingers and turned back toward the table. Strapped to the table was a gnome, short for even one of his race, he squirmed against the bonds that held him in place. Sweat dripped down his anguished face as he began to speak. &quot;I dont know anything! I swear it on Bertoxxulos's name, Dark One!&quot; &quot;True.&quot;, said Shadowedspawn, nodding his head in agreement. &quot;I knew this two days ago, but I had become so accustomed to the sounds of your screaming and pleading for your life that I have been doing this for my enjoyment.&quot; With a wave of his hand he called over the skeleton that had been standing silent and motionless in the corner. &quot;You may kill it now, but make it slow and painful so I may savor those last few moments.&quot; What was unmistakenly a grin formed on the skeletal features as it shambled foward to do it's masters bidding. <br>
<br>
Slamming his fist on the makeshift table, in what once was a room, he wondered if he would ever find what he sought. It had only been three years since that night he had fled from Neriak, first taking shelter in the forest and then when he had recovered his strength, out into Norrath. Three years and still no closer to finding his nameless foes that that night. It had taken the last of the platanium he had managed to recover days after the raid to get the name of the gnome that was dieing now. <br>
<br>
Begining his meditation, his mind flashed back over those last three years. His skill in arms had grown much in tht time, as had his knowledge of the necromatic arts, both of which had turned the tide of many an encounter to his favor time and time again. After leaving the forest he took instruction where ever he could, even so far as learning what he could from the &quot;Lesser&quot; races. He took all the knowledge they could offer, always avoiding questions concerning his house or family line. He had to becareful, lest those from the night found out he still lived and came for him before he was ready. Once he had been attacked by two High Elves screaming curses, but they had only been regilious fanatics of some weak Elven god. He had left there corpse's in such a manner that no one viewing them would belive them the victim of some animal attack. <br>
<br>
He left seeking new lands after that, carrying his new sword and some other items he was sure he could sell quite easily. He broke from his meditation, something had changed. The gnome had stopped screaming, but his minion had not reported to him yet. Silently he drew his Great Sword from it's scabbard and spoke a word of magic that would allow him to view invisible foes. He then called on his innate ability to hide from view as his keen hearing picked up voices from in the hall. Had they found him at last he wondered. Slowly two forms crept into view. The gnome was leading a wood elf into the room. &quot;He must have just left.&quot; exclaimed the gnome. &quot;He has kept me prisoner here for many days and tortured me all of those! I demand that you capture him, Ranger and take hiim in for trail!&quot; &quot;I know what Tunare's law requires, short one. We shall await his return and after his capture you may press your claim in Kelethian.&quot;, spoke the wood elf. His unspoked question answered he smilied and spoke a few harsh words of magic. The Ranger watched in horror as the gnome collapsed lifeless to the ground. Drawing his two scimitars he turned to face where he had heard the words spoken. <br>
<br>
&quot;Welcome to my Home.&quot;, said Shadowedspawn. &quot;May I know your name before I send you to Innoruuk's care Ranger?&quot; &quot;I am called Shairdan of Tunare's Rangers, and I will not be the one dieing today Dark Elf!&quot; snarled the Ranger as he sprand forward. Raising his sword to block Shairdan's attack Shadowedspawn cast a spell he knew his foe would never suspect. Gasping, Shairdan staggered as the spell took effect. He felt as if his blood was on fire, but continued to press his attack. &quot;A Shadoow Knight! What is one of your kind doing here?!&quot; Silently Shadowedspawn fought trading blow for blow, parry for parry, and block for block. On they fought, Shairdan slowly gaining the upper hand by means of his second scimitar. Suddenly Shadowedspawn gave an evil smile and spoke a word of magic. The pain that coursed through him was like no other that Shairdan had ever felt before. He lost focus on the battle for one breif second but it was long enough. Reversing his stance Shadowedspawn drove his sword into Shairdan's stomach, feeling only weak resistance before it burst from the Rangers back. Calling on the swords power he began drawing the transfixed rangers life force into himself. Shairdan could only watch as his oppenonts wounds healed and the weariness of the battle vanished from his face. <br>
<br>
&quot;I am called Shadowedspawn now Elf, but when you meet The Dark Father tell him that Da`zhann shall continue to send more souls to him!&quot; Twisting the sword cruelly, he withdrew it after watching the light fade from Shairdan's eyes. He left that night in no great hurry. The gnome had actually proven to be of some use by escaping and bringing the Ranger to him. He had enough items to continue his search and to bribe others to teaching him more. The day is coming, he thought, when those he sought would know of him and would tremble at the thought <p><img src="http://www.boutwellonline.com/rod/images/ss_sig.jpg">
