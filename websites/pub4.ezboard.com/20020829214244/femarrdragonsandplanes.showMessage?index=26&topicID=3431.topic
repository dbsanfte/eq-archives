  Unlike you I feel no need to bolster my insecurities by slamming An'lah Shok.  Apart from anything else, I have a tremendous respect for your guild in general, and several of your guildmates in particular.<br>

  That respect does NOT apply to you, it goes without saying.<br>

<br>
First, maybe being a little more specific when you're ranting/flaming will help clear up a lot of confusion. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I noticed previous posts about how a whole &quot;uber guild&quot; shouldn't be put to blame because of one single person.  I do agree with that.  Every guild has it's ... drawback(s).<br>
And that is just part of the game, yes.  I'm not quite sure how to word it differently so it does not imply that the WHOLE guild is responsible, just that single person(s).  But reading your original post, I, for one completely understood <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Second, I can see why your ranting in the first place.  I can see where you're coming from when that person(s) come from a higher standing guild and might have better than just a pair of SCWH and would most likely only sell them when someone else could actually USE them.  This is where I really wish more people used the NBG.  <br>
<br>
This is just my thoughts on it but yes, it would be fair to let that person playing 2 or more characters to roll once, especially if they need them.  If it's just for selling then the polite thing to do would let others have a chance at winning it that would be in actual need of the item.<br>
<br>
However, what REALLY ticks me off in this case is that the person had the nerve to complain after they already won something.  It's one thing to try and work it out and convince the other group members that you put twice as much effort into the group, that you deserve to roll twice.  <br>
<br>
I also play on another server and my guild leader there is a warrior.  He has a &quot;pet&quot; cleric on a second account that follows him around like a tail.  He is amazing, so don't ever say that one person can't play two characters as well as two individual people.  (What a troll, thanks Grummy)<br>
<br>
Okay but maybe I'm sidetracking (the booze is kicking in)<br>
Bottomline, if the person gave the mobs hell with both characters, let em have a go at another roll.  If they are going to whine and complain like babies because they can't roll on more loot to just sell it, give em the boot.<br>

<br>
I think, and this is just my opinion, that secondaries should NOT be included on any loot that that character will not use. <br>
<br>
If you are in a group and don't trust that secondary need before greed will work then secondaries should not get squat.<br>
<br>
I frequently play my bard with either my wizard or my monk depending on what the group already has or needs. If some nice monk weapon drops that is better than her KD and SoS then, yeah, I'll ask the group if she can have it. I won't random for it though...if it gets to the random point...then my main will be the only character included in the random.<br>
<br>
Frequently I just don't bother to tell people that my monk or my wizard are my twinks/secondaries. But I keep them out of the serious loot randoms. For the common junk, I'll let them stay in, so I don't have to explain. Usually, at most there is one person in my group that isnt in my group every other day. Most people don't really care who loots that jaundiced bone helm or book of twilight as long as the xps keeps moving along.<br>
<br>
Now when that RBG drops...chances are that even my monk won't get a shot at that.<br>
<br>
I think that when you look at what you should allow people to claim for their secondaries you should consider how much their secondary is contributing to the group. If they are critical and performing as well as the people playing one character, then let them claim a share of loot. If they are leeching xps and only positioning and pressing 'a' then they should feel lucky to be taking 20% of your xps.<br>
<br>
I know that my monk takes a few seconds to get properly engaged and probably only performs 80% as well as she would if she had her own player, but that is because I don't let my bard suffer just so I can dual wield PCs. My wizard on the other hand is so hotkeyed that she is easily indistinguishable from a fully played wizard, except for the fact that she never talks.<br>
<br>
The true bottom line is that we build our reputations with each group we play with. If we don't act in an acceptable manner, it will be harder for us to find a group next time. If we conduct ourselves with honor and get good xps...we end up with people waiting in line to play with us.<br>

Who let Skerry in here? Miscreant druid! ;)<br>
<br>
Seriously, he's right on... To insult anyone with the standing of Laoke, is ludicrous. I don't know what went on between Laoke and Curm, but it should be said that there are more than a few in Shok that don't see her that way, myself included.<br>
<br>
Secondly, there are more than a few in Shok that play more than one avatar at a time. I play two, there are others that play two, I know at least one other that plays four. There may be others playing five or six... more than once I've gotten into small pickup groups (outside Shok), commented how well they worked together, only to be corrected that "they" are all the same person. You don't always know...<br>
<br>
It's been said multiple times above: A person can train themselves to do anything, given time, money, opportunity, and drive. Playing 2, 4, or 6 avatars efficiently is just a question of understanding game mechanics and class interdependancies. Not that hard, and if you have fast reflxes and a well built desk, not unreachable.<br>
<br>
Heck, it's taking me longer to hit 250 pottery than it did to learn to play two avatars. ;) Because of limits in the game? Nope... because I didn't consider one of the basic game mechanics and had to learn my lesson the hard way.<br>
<br>
Anyway, that's my 2cp :)<br>

Playing multiple machines is a matter of quickkeys and developing patterns.  Get to know a spot and learn how to pull it safely.  Learn how to set up quickkeys so you can do all the things a group needs to do to kill a mob.  Not too bad just don't try to go on a raid that moves around a lot or fight in very trainy zones like ME or the like.  <br>

  On the topic of the original post, whether I'm double fisting in a non-guild group or not I won't random at all.  To be blunt there are no upgrades I can buy for Laoke, and my cleric is fairly well equipped as well.  I don't see why I should random on loot that would purely be plat cash to me when it would be a significant upgrade for others in the group.<br>

Don't get me wrong Lissome, not badmouthing you. I'm slightly alarmed at your dedication to your hobby, but hey, if it makes you happy. =)<br>
<br>
As for two-boxing; I feel competant that given the appropriate hot-keys and some practice, that I could definately play two classes as proficiently as most of the Norrathian populace. This doesn't mean my monk and cleric are going to blow Vendrix and Laoke out of the water, merely that the average EQ player seems to be pretty weak at efficiency on EQ.<br>
<br>
Oh, and double fisting your monk and cleric? You're a kinky kinky monk, Laoke...<br>
<br>
no wonder you picked a female avatar, otherwise you could only use one fist...<br>

Well, yeah, the bondage gear I made made up specially for Flossy sort of gives it away (have you any idea how hard it is to get a latex catsuit onto a ewe?), but in this case it's simply a guild convention:  in MF we refer to multiple Avatar use as 'fisting'.  Hence I double fist, she triple fists, Dabiggun has been quintriple fisted.<br>
<br>
  Personally, I blame Popplo for corrupting the youth of our guild.<br>
