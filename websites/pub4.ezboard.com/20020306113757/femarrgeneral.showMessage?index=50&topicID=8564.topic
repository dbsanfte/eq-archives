I feel like I'm constantly explaining myself.. I really should learn to do it right the first time  :-P .  In my preceding posts I was talking about 2 seperate issues.  <br>
<br>
#1 Issue addressed: People getting mad enough to do physical harm to shithead_01.  I love my cars.  Someone maliciously harming them have a bad time coming.  People LOVE their EQ characters, someone actively screws them.. I can see them beating that person down.  In previous posts I said I would not bodily harm someone over EQ.  I was putting perspective to those that are ready to go beat the moron.<br>
<br>
#2 Issue addressed:  Do the characters have value.  My comment on this one was if he made $13,000 from them.. they obviously hold a cash value.  If they did not, he could not have gotten the money for them.<br>
<br>
I'm sure this will spawn numerous posts but look at drugs.  Let's take cocaine for example.  Being in the US, this is an illegal substance.  It is illegal to sell cocaine, yet you can't argue that it doesn't have a cash value.  Of note however, if you take someone to court for the cash value of stolen cocaine, your case will be dropped due to a law that says you cannot sue for loss from an illegal act (possession of cocaine is illegal).  <br>
<br>
To me, this means that whether a lawsuit will be successful will be determined whether it is illegal to sell them.  The user agreement is not a US law, it is drawn up by VI.  There are also loopholes to work your way around a lot of &quot;contracts&quot;.  <br>
<br>
Also take into consideration that the selling was done by one who was not the rightful owner of the characters.  Therefor, the rightful owners did not break the user agreement by selling their stuff.  Shithead_01 did. (Sharing their passwords did break it as well as being stupid, dont know how this would affect outcome).<br>
<br>
I didn't equate ownership of my vette to ownership of a character.  I equated my feelings for my car to others' feelings for their characters.  I also equated that it has a cash value that is high enough to make this a complex case.<br>
<br>
Dwark... a share of a company is not a tangible object either.. but has worth.  <br>
<br>
I'm not sure I got out all I wanted to reply to, but this is already way longer than I prefer to post.  Sorry it's so much on the eyes.<br>

Ok Dalamarn I misunderstood what you were saying in your first post about this, and your posts show intelligence, I retract my taunt about &quot;anger management.&quot;<br>

Ilegally they do hold a cash value, legally they don't, EQ characters are made up of pixels and are not tangible. Both of us could discuss this issue for the next 3 milleniums and still not agree with each other.<br>

Drugs are illegal but tangible and yes they do have cash value, to use or sell drugs you do not have to agree to a EULA, they are owned solely by the person that buys them and not owned by some corporation that protects its property via a EULA. <br>

Thats true but stocks are legal items. As I understand it stocks are all about buying part of a company, all completely legal. The characters may be worth $13,000 but that money belongs to Sony as they own the characters, so the monetary loss to this player for losing his account is zero.<br>

<br>
The tangibility issue is irrelevant; while you may personally choose to place little or no value on something because it is intangible, that has no bearing on it's legal status or the value that others place on it.  For example, if I uploaded the entire Everquest client to a server of my own and allowed others to download it for free, that would be illegal.  I wouldn't be stealing a tangible item, no disks changed hands and VI didn't actually lose any physical items.  However, I would still be considered to have broken the law.  The folks at VI or in the court wouldn't care about whether I choose to value the EQ client program or not, they do.  It's legal status is completely independent of it's tangibility or lack thereof. <p>Erevan MacQuaide, cleric of Nimue <BR>

<br>
Since the characters belong to Sony.. what if Sony sued moron for 13k worth of loss?  Well.. since it is still on their machines.. how can they have loss.. even with it being sold?  I know this is all contradictory but I'm just looking at this from all sides and putting the ideas down as I go along.<br>
<br>
I still think I'm right on the stock thing.  You may have a tangible piece of paper saying that share belongs to you (like a title to a car) and it has value (you own a part of the company).  But it's not a tangible thing.  For instance.. a WHOLE lot of people have Enron stock.  It DID have value.  They still own the stock but the only tangible things they have is Jack and shit... and Jack left town.<br>

Interesting angle there and believe me there are multiple angles to look at in this situation, with all of them being right in the eyes of the person giving their point of view.<br>
<br>
If you come up with any other angles I might have to start cursing and flaming randomly or maybe even reciting Chiteng's Haiku.<br>

<br>
A can of coke has an absoloute value<br>
A 60th Warrior has an implied value<br>
<br>
As others have pointed out, the fact that characters change hands for real currency, and the fact that a market exists for these characters, gives them value.<br>
<br>
Value can also be tied to work or effort.  Now if you work as a coder and produce programs for your employer then the employer will (unless your contract states otherwise and barring any country specific anomalies) retain intellectual property rights to that code. <br>
<br>
To those who say the chars have no value you may want to consider the EULA for EQ, legally its very difficult to prove ownership on something that has no value and yet Verant state that the account and characters belong to them, this implies that both have value.<br>
<br>
Every test you can oput against an EQ account deems it to have a material value to either Verant and/or the acount holder and to other people who may wish to buy it.<br>
<br>
While the game is virtual the time spent on it is not, and as we all know, time = money.<br>
<br>
Consider share trading.  Time is spent selling and buying (and researching) small bits of companies and while the shares have an implicit value at a set time, try taking your share certificate to the company in question and demanding its worth in real currency.<br>
<br>
Time is the most valuable commodity we have (imho), hence the phrase 'spending' time, in that we purchase 'goods/services' with our time.<br>

<br>
Even if you say that the characters aren't real, that 'stealing' a character from someone else is legal, the point remains that there are still plenty of legal things you can do to other people to make them feel as bad as you felt about losing your character.<br>
<br>
Considering how widely viewed that thread was, the kid is bound to be getting bombarded with legal, non-physical annoyances by now. If he's lucky his dad's work-place isn't getting hit with the same, or his dad could get fired for creating a disturbance... <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrgeneral.showPrevMessage?topicID=8564.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrgeneral.showNextMessage?topicID=8564.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrgeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8564.topic&index=65><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/gfx/addReply1.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrgeneral.emailToFriend?topicID=8564.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrgeneral.threadControl?topicID=8564.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/deleteThreadFire.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrgeneral.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=8564.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrgeneral.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=8564.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub4.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="emarrmessageboardrules">Message Board Rules<option value="emarrlinks">Links<option value="emarrupcomingmmorpgs">Upcoming MMOG's<option value="emarrfrm18">America Under Attack<option value="emarrfrm19">Dark Age of Camelot<option value="emarrgeneral">General<option value="emarrfrm17">Funny Stuff<option value="emarrbazaar">Item Bazaar<option value="emarrscrollsnspells">Spell Bazaar<option value="emarrfrm15">Shiny Things<option value="emarrfrm14">Bargain Basement<option value="emarrdragonsandplanes">Rants and Flames<option value="emarrfrm13">Dragons and Planes<option value="emarrroleplaying">Roleplaying<option value="emarrroleplayingoocforum">Roleplaying - OOC Forum<option value="emarrscammeralert">Scammer Alert<option value="emarrsignaturecorner">Test Forum<option value="emarrreallife">Real Life<option value="emarrothermmorpgs">Other MMOG's</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#E9D756>- </font><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/bemarr>Erollisi Marr, The Queen of Love</a><font color=#E9D756> - </font><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrgeneral>General</a> <font color=#E9D756> - </font><br><br> <br>
