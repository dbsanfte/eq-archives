<br>
Just because you don't like the way someone plays their character or you suspect they might be preoccupied doesn't warrant them being shitlisted.<br>
<br>
Part of being a Bard is being asked to play songs... I seriously doubt he meant to be pushy about it, but was simply telling you what he needed from you in the group. Further more, if you were &quot;shaking with rage&quot; perhaps you're taking things a little too seriously.  <br>
<br>
I think this should be locked, since when is ok to shitlist someone because you don't like the way they play?  If that were the case I'm sure all of us would have TONS of people we could bitch about.. <br>
<br>
Get over it.<br>

He was no different then.  I, too, wonder why he made a Cleric - he doesn't heal.<br>
<br>
I won't go into all the nasty little details but I will say a few things.  He'd rather pull than heal or med.  He'd rather nuke than heal or med.  He'd rather melee than heal or med.  Heck - he does everything but heal or med.<br>
<br>
He seems to be the buff addict type in the manner that he feels he MUST have Clarity on him 24/7.  This, of course, is due to the fact that he won't med.  You'll see him meleeing a mob and then in groupsay you see him say &quot;oom&quot; - but he's still meleeing rather than medding and the tanks are getting low on hp.<br>
<br>
His comments are way out of line and go beyond sexist.  Let's just say that I am quite the non-PC guy and the only thing that generally offends me are people that are offended. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Smallus, however, shoots straight past sexism/racism or any other &quot;sensitivity&quot; issue and goes full-bore into abusiveness.<br>
<br>
I ended up kicking him out of my group in LoIO, and later in OT while I was a member of a group that leader gave him the boot, too, without my lifting a finger.  Smallus managed to &quot;blacklist&quot; himself in OT in under a week.  Not one of us regular group leaders would let him in our groups.  Emerging group leaders would unkowingly let him in... for about an hour.  That was a feat on Smallus' part considering the constant search for a healer there those days.  You could find him lfg for hours on end.<br>
<br>
I had debated shitlisting him back then but he really didn't fit into a ks/ninja-looting miscreant category.  He's just a no-load-never-had-his-ass-kicked-little-kid-who's-never-been-disciplined.<br>
<br>
Now I see that not being able to get a group regularly has not deterred him from playing as many of us hoped it would.  A part of me is glad that he finally ended up here.  I'll vouch for the need to stay away from him, to keep him out of your group and you might even want to put him on ignore during your next login just to avoid the sound of his voice.<br>

Hell, just yesterday I was helping Grumples kill ragefire for his cleric epic and friggin Smallus was in my group /sigh. Not even 5 mins before we were about to kill Ragefire he goes afk without saying a word and sits directly under where the dragon spawns. He had NO resists and didn't buff anyone. Low and behold as soon as we spawn the dragon he is one of the first ones to die. We did manage to kill the dragon without his sorry ass but I still find it funny that after the dragon died he couldn't figure out why he was at his bind spot naked. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>

I was Group leader at one time in ot when he and another  person were LFG so I invited them. As we were fighting He and the Monk that was with him left the group in middle of fight causing 2 deaths. He then started OOC'ing for others to Join his group. As he was our healer I ask him what was up and he never answered. I have group again only because I was not leader but have left groups shortly afterward due to His inability or refusal to heal. To many people have died as a result of his actions and THAT is what makes this a viable post.<br>

Just my 2 cp worth. If you chose to group with him then you deserve the Death that will ultimately come.<br>

We kicked him from our group yesterday and back pulled to zone in sebby to get a new cleric and that something I have _never_ done before.  It's not playing style, it ineptitude and someone to be wary of.  I believe the SL mentions 'People to steer clear of' in it's summary.  <br>
<br>
Until he learns how to play he is a danger to our friends.  Keep in mind the SL has actually spurred some people to change their ways for the better...I can think of 2 off the top of my head.<br>

And he doesnt play gems.  Another thing I keep reading is him nuking.  Every time I watch him play, only things he has memmed are healing spells and buffing spells.  I think he should take one thing off and put a stun spell up there but its his play style.  And I agree totally with yall about him saying those comments, i yell at him all the time about that.  He doesnt seem to listen =(.  Well, here is my post.<br>

<br>
One of the reasons I solo so much is the fact I do have responsibilities that keep me afk sometimes.<br>
<br>
When I have time I can play uninterrupted, I get a group.<br>
<br>
Play styles are a completely different matter, however.  Clerics who let people die are clerics that should have been necros.  Clerics who melee are clerics that should have been pal/war/shd/rng/rog/mnk.  Clerics who nuke should have been wiz/mag/dru.<br>

<br>
in my opinion, the sexist and racist /ooc remarks make me glowering dubiously, but the fact that everyone says 'STAY AWAY FROM HIM' makes me scowling, ready to attack =P<br>
<br>
its a tough call.  i'd say i'd like to leave this up for a little longer, it is proving itself based on merit.  This list -is- for people who should be avoided... i'd really like to see some support for him, i can't believe a cleric could get to that level without healing properly.<br>

(even though my opinion is such, i can't see this staying up here... we'd like to reserve the shitlist for players are -dishonorable- to the point of needing to be avoided... if we allowed shitlisting of players that just play the game poorly... well... sheesh... i'd hate to see my name up here.... &lt;remembers training people in new zones&gt;)<br>

<br>
IMO... the cleric is one of the, if not the most vital role in most groups.  If a cleric is a bad cleric... ppl die.  And we all know that dying due to someone else's lack of ability or understanding of thier class is the most frustrating death there is.  So... if the general concensus is that he is a terrible cleric... by all means he should be up here.  People dying due to someone who lacks skill, and class understanding, makes for terribly unhappy and frustrated people.  I myself would deffinately consider a heads up on such people as a blessing to the community.<br>
<br>
Point being, I agree... KSing and Ninja Looting should not be the only reason's for SLing... being a harmful and disruptive player, be it personally (offensive /ooc use), or just endangerment of others (lack of understanding of your classes roll) should warrant such postings also.  <br>
<br>
That is just my 2cp<br>
