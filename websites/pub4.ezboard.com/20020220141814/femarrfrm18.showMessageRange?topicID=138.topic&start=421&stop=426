<br>
I just think that we need to focus on the future and accept our past. I just don’t like people referring to the past and think that is how religion is today? Or take the few bad apples and ruin the entire bushel.  <br>
<br>
I think religion has changed (all religion) because of technology and we don’t need to read bones to check the weather or check entrails to see where to plant our crops these days. I could kill my dog and call it whatever I want religion is a beleif of Many and they are free to follow it!<br>
<br>
I get people all the time that bring up the statement you said in your last post and I say to them well you used to burn witches? And you slaughtered the Muslims to “bring Christianity” to them and you know what cracks me up they say “OH NO” there is know way they where Christians. Umm… sorry I think they called them a HOLY CRUSADE? <br>
<br>
I am not up for a debate I just don’t like when people bring up the past and think that is how we are today. I think it falls down to ignorance on both sides.  <br>
<br>
Yes the early whites had slaves (but I should not have to pay for that), yes the Christians burned witches but I don’t go knocking on the relatives of salam, yes the Christians “slaughtered” the Muslims during the holy crusades but that does not mean the Christian today has to pay for this slaughter. <br>
<br>
I guess at times I get defensive because its like being a square peg in a round society. Tell someone your are a witch and OMG you have just turned into SATAN.  I am sorry but I think that %50 of the Christian church is ignorant of the fact there was the divine WAY before their god and there will be the divine when there GOD ceases to exist.  The Egyptian gods where here for thousands and thousands of years the Christian god has been here for what? 2 or 3k so there is a lot of time left.<br>
<br>
Remember people above else we are HUMAN FIRST! I am not going to take your kid for my next holiday celebration.  Please don’t try and save me or convert me to a GOD I do not believe in. <br>
<br>
Do not fear what you do not understand!<br>

I think the statement Neil Gaiman made was in reference to the Barnes and Noble set of witches running across the country. There are some who do believe that the witches were destroyed because they represented female empowerment, not because they represented something that gave fear, (admittedly unfounded) and confusion to an uneducated Christian mass.(better clarify that too, in the middle ages and in colonial America there was no educational system to speak of, let alone the sharing of different points of view) <br>
<br>
I do understand why you went on the defensive though, that is why I posted I was trying not to offend. I actually figured I'd get a Christian reply telling me that Christmas is not the winter solctice. I have been spotted reading the Aliester Crowley and Anton LeVey by people trying to save me from my own education. <br>
<br>
Also, I prefer Wiccan to witch when referring to modern practicers, because witch is unspecific and does have dark connotations. I do understand the use of the word by your sect is just in an effort to disempower it, like rappers calling themselves niggers, to a degree.<br>

There have been a lot of good posts with some excellent thinking and research.  (You have to weed through the insults and flames to find them.)  So I figured I would throw my opinion out there as well.<br>
<br>
I grew up in a positive Christian environment.  I was babtized at 7 and was a full believer.  At 10, I started to doubt after learning about sex and Santa Claus.  (Yuck.  Sex and Santa Claus should not be in the same sentence.)  By 13 I was atheist.<br>
<br>
I formed my belief based on a couple of things.  One was people said the world was too perfect not to have been created.  It didn't make sense to me for something more perfect to be invented to explain the creation.  I wanted to know &quot;Who created the creator?&quot;  The other was the Bible did not feel right to me.  God's motives seemed purely odd.<br>
<br>
My grandmother keeps trying to convert me.  We sometimes have religious discussions but it ultimately comes down to how we choose our belief.  It is like we have a huge box of possibilities for life and we can choose any to live our life by.  Everyone has a different strategy for their pick.  Some believe that life must have a meaning so they are inclined to a certain religion.  Some pick based on going for a &quot;simpliest&quot; choice.  So I don't think there can ever be a right or wrong answer to what we believe.  All we can do is see if the beliefs are self consistent.  This is where the science usually comes in.  We try to compare our ideology with observations and see if they logically fit.<br>
<br>
So over the years I have still tried to understand Christianity (much like I was attracted to mythology in school).  Someone once asked me if the Christian God could be proven without a doubt to me, would I then worship him?  I decided I couldn't.  So here were my reasoning behind it.<br>
<br>
1.  Christianity and Greek mythology are very similar in many stories.  At one point Zeus is upset at the bad lives of the people so he wants to throw lightning and kill them all.  However, he worries that the fire will destroy Olympus.  So he asks Poseidon to flood the world instead.  He ends up sparing an old couple.  The couple throws rocks behind them which turn into people.<br>
<br>
This story is very similar to the Christian flood with a few character changes so I believe they two religions have common origins.<br>
<br>
2.  I have heard that one translation of Gennesis was &quot;The gods creates the heavans and the earth.&quot;  This could imply that the angels were the other gods.<br>
<br>
3.  God must not be that well liked for 1/3 of the beings that know him to rise up and try to overthrow him.<br>
<br>
4.  Lucifer is sometimes referred to as &quot;light bringer&quot; which could have a tie in to Prometheus, the one that brought fire and mechanical knowledge to humans.  Prometheus was punished by Zeus and was changed to a rock where his liver was eaten out daily.  Prometheus is tied to integrity since he had knowledge that could have hurt Zeus but never released it.<br>
<br>
5.  God does a lof of evil stuff.  It is easy to say that he is powerful and he must know better.  However, think what would happen is world leaders acted like God.<br>
<br>
a.  God committed mass genocide(flood) in order to purify the human race.  (Hitler)<br>
b.  God destroys Sodom and Gomorrah because he does not like the values and beliefs of the people.  (Would it be ok for ther American persident to nuke some Africian countries because they may still practive slavery and female circumcision, which are values that are not tolerated in the US?)<br>
c.  God kills first born sons to try to make a king back down.  (Imagine Clinton ordering Navy seals to go to Yugoslavia and kill the first born sons to make Milosevic back down?)<br>
d.  He tortures Lot to try to prove a point.  (Reminds me a little of &quot;Trading Places&quot; with Eddy Murphy.)<br>
e.  He gets Abraham to kill Isaac (Abraham's son).  Then he calls it off.  Talk about screwing with people's minds.  It reminds me of a good show about mobsters trying to impress a mafia boss.<br>
f.  He sets Adan and Eve up.  They were not suppose to eat from the Tree of Knowledge.  One of God's creations (Satan) tells them it ok and they believe him.  (Why not, they are innocent.)  They get into big time trouble.  For fun, put a bowl of candy in a room with some children and tell them not to eat it.  Then send in another adult to say it is ok.  Walk in 5 minutes later and punish all the kids that ate the candy.<br>
g.  He likes to put on a flashy show.  The flood is really hard to pull off.  You have problems like fresh and salt water fish mising.  Where does all the water come from?  Did the lions get too hungry and eat the unicorns?  How can evolution go fast enough to get the great variety in all the species (cats dogs etc.)?  Water falling at 5 feet per hour should cause massive erosion.  How did kangeroos get to Australia?  It has to be miracle after miracle to explain it.  Why not just send a virus?<br>
f.  There are many other things.  Most of this is from the old Testamant.  He acts a lot like Zeus with just one offspring later on.  (The New Testament may have been more interesting if it had been Hercules instead of Jesus.)<br>
<br>
6.  The new testament tries to undo a lot of the old testament.  The focus changes more to love and forgiveness.  However, it is hard to be convinced that Jesus was the son of God.<br>
a.  He is reguarded as a prophet at best by other major religions.<br>
b.  I have heard more about Elvis being seen after his death that I did of Jesus.  (Imagine if Elvis was the second coming.)<br>
c.  I have met several people that said they were Jesus reincarnated.  Who am I to say they are not.<br>
d.  Maybe the next big religion will be based on David Keresh and how he was killed in the Waco fire.  We just need someone to write about him based on things he said within the next 100 years to have the same start Jesus did.<br>
<br>
So enough rampling on my part.  I would just have to conclude that God is Zeus and acts like a petty tyrant.  We just know him through his inspired book that serves as his public relations guide.  To be fair, we need Lucifer to publish as well so we can have a honest debate between the two.  I think Springer should host this and we can find out what caused the fight between the two and if it can be reconcilled.  In addition, it could be revealed that God never paid child support to Mary and due to interest owes a lot.<br>
<br>
Oh well.  Don't take me too seriously.  I sure don't.<br>

Let's take your view of the Flood where you liken it to &quot;Hitler&quot;.<br>
<br>
The Genesis account of the Flood is a typical &quot;story&quot; used by the faithful to deliver the message of God. If the Genesis account were literal, then I would join you in the fist shaking against God. Truth be told, God doesn't practice genocide. How do I know this? God is, by definition, omnibenevolent. The perfection of love would not wrong his creation. So, that means the Biblical references to commanding genocide, destruction, blah, blah, are more likely primitive stories delivering an intended message to an audience at a specific time. I get excited every time I think about this because that means God has truly communicated with his creation, but not at the expense of our free wills. Rather, God has inspired some to deliver his message to the world.<br>
<br>
Some wonder why God is not speaking today? Why just through ancient texts? Truth is, God is speaking today through his beloved Church. Every tradition being handed down each &quot;holy day&quot; counts as the words of God. Yes, the traditions are not Canonized as &quot;Scripture&quot;, but inspire none the less.<br>
<br>
I encourage you (or anyone else) to look at Christianity afresh. Sure, there are many voices. I have read some Christians here using the Bible as an axe (they have the fervor of Peter prior to Jesus being taken away to his crucifixion), but I submit that God is more interested in what you want to honestly do with your life and is not concerned with what flavor of Christian doctrine you want at the time.<br>
