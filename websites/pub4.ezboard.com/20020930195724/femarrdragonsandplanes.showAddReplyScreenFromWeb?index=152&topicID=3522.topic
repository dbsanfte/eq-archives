I offered Thisosa in loot for the king, I never said he was out.  The second time he came to charadok EXPECTING that the raid was to get his loot for thisosa or his enchanter.  He was not invited by me for that raid, and as soon as I told him I wasnt going to directly give him loot then he left.  <br>
<br>
As for pick-up raids I have always, always, random'd my loot unless we are going for someones epic piece.  In that case I note that ahead of time so for cases like Kelewala expecting to get the enchanter piece, they can leave and I could care less.<br>
<br>
The only ones that will complain about loot are the ones that I won't put up with bullshit.  The loot in my guild is not decided just by myself, or Ironlute, but by all council members.  If you want to accuse Ironlute, or myself of being loot whorish come up with some proof about it, instead of just saying we are.  Go ask my members if they feel that loot is given fairly, not just say &quot;I didnt get loot, therefore, Gorndax is a loot whore&quot;.  You fail to mention anything anywhere that deems myself or Ironlute as a loot whore.  What did they recieve?  How did they recieve it?  All you are doing is basing off the fact that YOU didnt get your way to get loot, and therefore, you are whining to the boards about not having such and such an item.  That is loot whoring at its best.  <br>
<br>
And sure you came out to raids, I kinda liked you at first.  Soon as I found out you were just in it to get items for yourself, and started shouting to zone how to do things, and causing problems with organizing I didnt want you anymore.  You are just bitter.  Remember, RE was a different RE way back then.  Most of our raids will still pickup raids.  I had LoM, LoF, RE and other p eople all having fun together, and your about the only person complaining about loot.  <br>
<br>
Btw Kelewala, going to other raids and helping out is good thing to do, but it doesnt give proof to anything about me promising you something, or that we are loot whores.<br>

<br>
And Barry, I really dont give a @#%$ about your robe.  In fact, by the rules you agreed to help made as a founding member of RE that you once displayed in your signature once you left the guild all guild property items should have been returned.  That was the robe and the VS staff I gave you (that you werent there for).  I never bothered you about it anyway.  <br>
<br>
As anyone that knows thats been a guild leader or a raid leader, none of your decisions will ever be met without some sort of resistance.  Everyone has different opinions and you try and make the decision thats best for the guild as a whole, without ticking off a large majority.  You caused a riot over a robe, and still hold a grudge against one decision I made.  I told you I thought it was best for the guild to get some guild funds, and that others thought it too. I also said that I gave it to you because I felt it be better you were happy than a few K in the bank, but, youd have to deal with people in the guild about it.  Im so glad my decision to let you have it was met with understanding *chuckle*.<br>
<br>
Now really kids, this is all pretty petty @#%$ here.  The majority of people that posted were in on time in RE that had left, been kicked out, or been given a decision to stay or leave and left.  Take your baggage with your because poking out from the woodwork to toss in ones ideas isnt going to make or break a guild.  I care all for my friends and my family and my guild, but really, I dont give a @#%$ about anyone that crosses the line.<br>

I could be wrong. Isnt Gurglespit a warrior? Above lvl 55? Meaning kick does the same as slam(stun)? Just woundering...<br>

ROFLMAO!!!  I almost spewed up a lung over that one.  Honestly, Gorn, you're funnier than Robin Williams now.<br>
<br>
See, I was kinda under the impression that I was fighting for a principle.  While I was arguing with you I had no idea that the other casters were gonna drop out of the roll.  I wanted ALL of us to have a chance on the random that you rescinded.<br>
<br>
Get this through your head . . . I was receiving /tells from a TON of guildies during that whole scene, telling me they couldn't believe your actions.  You came about *this* close to losing half of RE right then, at that time.  And for the next few days . . . and every now and then for several months afterwards . . . I kept getting /tells from people in RE that said &quot;Good for you, I'm glad you fought for the robe.&quot;  I really felt like a million bucks!  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I'm glad I had to deal with the guild about it; thanks, bucko.<br>
<br>
It's interesting; your story keeps changing.  You first claimed that this all happened on the same day I got the Robe of Benevolence, but it was in fact at least one full month later.  You claim that you wanted to give me the robe but others were arguing against it.  You then say that, yeah, you wanted to sell it for the guild coffers but then decided that keeping me happy was a better idea.<br>
<br>
But you have never once owned up to the fact that you announced the damn random and then changed the rules on everyone, on a piece that would have been an upgrade for almost every single pure caster that was on that raid.<br>
<br>
Dude, you and Ironlute made a wrong turn at the intersection between reality and la-la land quite a ways back.  I'm really amazed that you can keep deluding yourself in this way.<br>

Funny, it was supposed to be guild property all along, but Lute always refused to let anyone else wear it.  Thank YOU, try again.<br>

This is the last time I'm talking about the Crimson Robe of Alendine or the skellie pendant.  Remember, chuckles, YOU brought the robe back up this last time.  Personally, I'm done.  Burned out.  Don't bother changing the bulb, I'm done kicking boxes around in this room.  (Oooh, mixed metaphors.)<br>

<br>
1) I want sunstrike, lets go kill kunark dragons<br>
<br>
2) My gear sucks (or it was something to that effect, dont remember the exact words)  I wish i had the equivalant in melee gear that she has....<br>
<br>
other tidbits about Iron's whinyness:<br>
<br>
also commonly heard in guild chat was how EH &quot;stole&quot; RE's tactics for HoT, /laugh<br>
<br>
She also blabbed to a friend of mine who she did not know about the whole RE/EH issue, and how there was a banked sunstrike she didnt and how she was upset about that.  A complete stranger.  then she comes to these boards ragging on people about this being a private issue.....<br>
<br>
way back at the beginning of this thread, she said something about not knowing where rumors about EH stealing RE recruits came from... she was the one who brought taht up in RE guild chat, a couple of times....<br>
<br>
.... Yah, hypocrisy sucks and is a major pet peave of mine.<br>
<br>
No, i did not leave RE because i didnt get Item &quot;X&quot;.  I left primarily because of hypocrisy.  RE is run on the whims of Iron when she is online.  <br>
<br>
Right before i left silk robe #2 for the guild dropped, Iron was at awork.  At first it was going to be randomed to the Int casters there + iron.  then someone suggested that it just be given to Iron.  So gorn asks those in the random if they object.  What kind of a shitty thing to do is that, first you say, Oh yah you all have a chance.  Then you make them look like a &quot;loot whore&quot; (your definition) if they say no to it being given to iron w/no random.<br>
<br>
Then iron says she turns items down because others need them more.... some of RE's casters are wearing pretty shitty robes... yah....<br>
<br>
dare i say, more hypocrisy?<br>
<br>
So yah, call people  loot whores Gorn.... hypocrit <p><a href='http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=248327'>Birren Anklebiter</a><BR>

<br>
Are you able to read and comprehend English? Doesnt seem that way. <br>
<br>
I asked for Wammbaamm to be in the random and was told she would be, until I arrived and you decided the raid was FOR someone in particular and there would be no random. So  I left.<br>
<br>
You also have the facts wrong concerning Thisosa. On this first King raid with you, she didnt win random on king. The &quot;rogue with out lock pick skills&quot;  incident didnt involve me, you must be confused. <br>
<br>
The raid which you asked my rogue to come to was when I made the deal with you for Thisosa. Unfortunately every time you were in Chardok after that you refused to make good on your promise.<br>
<br>
Now when you asked Wammbaamm, my enc, to help I asked if she would be in the random and was told she would be, until I arrived and you decided the raid was FOR someone in particular and there would be no random. So I decided to leave, and at that time let you know i was very disappointed in you. You and Ironlute responded with threats, name calling and finally a promise to checlk the logs.<br>
<br>
Since then I've written you both off. But when I read the lies about Chamcham and Barrrymore, I felt people would like to know just what kind of people you are. <br>
<br>
Hope you can sleep at night. <br>

Ive only added facts.  Changed would have been that I said that I didnt random, then I did.  And you still get tells about it?  Well great for you, Im sure the highlight of your day is something that happened 6 months ago.  People would have left because I didnt give you a robe?  What a bunch of loyalty there to a guild.  I'd be glad to get rid of them and thats a damn quick way to do it lol.  And so what if people told you good for sticking up (glad you stuck up to whine about it)... I got tells not to give it to you.  And Iron, has always given out the pendant when in need, theres no reason to wear it, its a click buff.<br>
<br>
You still have done nothing to prove that theres something wrong here.  All you are is one pissed off gnome about a robe.  If you based a persons character off one event you choose one that suits your current hatred for me making the EH split happen.  If I was a better person, Id judge it by an event that you know is more inline with myself.  That would be being so depressed that Barrymore has never been upgraded, then being handed VS staff in the Bazaar.  I got a ton of thanks from you then.  But alas!  No amount of good actions can outdo you if something doesnt go your way.  <br>
<br>
Birren, you constantly complained about what items you want, and fought with another MT in the guild.  In fact, the day you left you had abandoned a quick raid to kill Harla Dar because we wouldnt pull the Valley Dragons for you to get a chance to get a dragon shoulder.  You were given the chance to either come back or leave the guild.  Where does that put you?  And before you say anything about faction, Harla Dar drops faction on the same level as Woushi which is negligible, the dragons you want drop a half level each... and this was said at the raid.  Besides, you got your set of SS armor because I trusted you, well too much so to see you walk away very soon later.<br>
<br>
Kelewala, whine more about not getting loot somewhere else lol.  Really, I'm just sick of &quot;Raid was for me, loot was for me, I didnt get my way... wah mommy wah&quot;.  <br>
<br>
Maybe I should complain about loot and request your items back that you agreed too.  If you didnt, wouldnt that make you a thief.<br>

I did and still do want it to be a successful guild.  I think there are some things you are missing and its going to tear RE apart if its not addressed and fixed.<br>
<br>
Gorn, do you not listen?  I didnt really care about the shoulders, only reason i brought it up was i figured, &quot;if we're gonna take a faction hit, lets take a faction hit&quot;.  I left because you wouldnt @#%$ listen to me about the faction issue.  <br>
<br>
I did not complain about loot all the time.  Only time i complained about not killing a mob was when we were right next to Maestro in Hate, and Iron was insisting on killing Velk.... didnt make much sense to me... and that was the only reason i brought it up.  <br>
<br>
When i expressed my concern, you should not have brushed me off.  You should not have told me to STFU.  that is, if you wanted me, and the SS armor on me to stay.  Up until the point you told me to STFU i had no intention of leaving the guild.  It was YOU and Ironlute that caused me to leave.  You were right to trust me with the armor.  But when you start pulling this BS, you cannot expect anyone to stay, especially after you insult them the way you did me in guild chat.  <br>
<br>
You keep bringing up this other MA thing.  Yes, there was a disagreement, those happen, welcome to life gorn.  But it hasnt been an issue for well over 2 months.  <br>
<br>
The reason i left was not because i didnt get loot.  A small part of it had to do with the way some loot was handled (loot totally unrelated to me btw, so you cant call me a loot whore on that one), but over all the way you,.... nm the way Iron runs your guild.  And they way you addressed valid concerns brought up by one of your guild members, that was shared by others, tho they did not speak up (i recieved two tells to this effect, no i didnt take any SSs was too flustered about being chased out of the guild).<br>
<br>
What gets me on top of all this, the night i deguilded, i recieved no /tells from you at all before or after.  After i recieved one from Iron asking for the guild owned equipmenti had.  i told her i had none.  She said what about the UP weapons?  My response: What UP weapons?  The ones that would be No drop if i had them?  Way to @#%$ know how to gear your MTs/guild.  All she was concerned with was loot, not trying to work the issue out.... real nice and classy....<br>
<br>
Gorn, you are teh best raid leader i have ever seen.  But your methods of running a guild are lacking, as pointed out by numerous people, all pointing to the same issues.  I could see it if it was a few isolated incidents.  But you have many many people (reputable people for the most part) all saying the same thing.  That should give you pause to stop and think that maybe, even if some of what the say is wrong, just maybe there might be a grain of truth in something they are saying.<br>
<br>
I hope RE can be successful, but atm, i know of several people considering leaving... that should give you pause as well.  It does not look to me like RE will last at its current str much longer. And that saddens me.<br>
<br>
You can say that i left because of loot, becuase at the surface it looks that way, but wtf would i leave a guild that i got a full suit of SS in, over a shoulder peice that can be bought.  I am not stupid, and that would be a stupid thing to do especially if i was a &quot;loot whore&quot;.  <br>
<br>
Something i have noticed through this thread you have not denied with any sort of proof several of the accusations made.  Whether you chose to do this, or whether you have no proof, it does not look good for you Gorn.  If you have no proof, that to should give you pause to stop and think.<br>
<br>
Several people here have given multiple examples of what we are talking about, all indicating the same thing.  This should also give you pause.  <br>
<br>
There is definately something wrong Gorn, i dont think even you can deny that.  <br>
<br>
I think the best thing for RE would be for you to step down as the leader (not as a raid leader, you are the best at that) and let someone else handle guild issues while you handle raids.  But that is just my opinion and almost certainly wont happen.  <br>
<br>
I really hate to see all the work so many people have put into RE be for nothing if it implodes like it is looking to me atm. <br>

She's also your girlfriend.  And she's unstable, which is well-known.  Hell, she trumpets it over /guild.  If you can't see exactly how that compromises ANY decision you make that concerns her, then you are beyond all hope.<br>

The reason I responded was because the flame was bumped by Zelgadis.  We had a meditator fix that problem in game.  Anyone else that wants a free poke, our back is turned on this thread, for I've made my points.<br>

But dont ignore the other points i have brought up Gorn.  <br>
<br>
And yes, i admit i bragged that I, a haffer in non ntov gear had over 4k unbuffed hps, more than the ogres and trolls in the guild.  So sue me.  Not like others /caugh Iron, didnt brag as about their highlights as well....  But i didnt do it on a daily basis /caugh Iron...<br>
<br>
something is wrong gorn, fix it before it kills RE.<br>
<br>
I refrained from posting all this for so long because i thought it would do RE more harm than hurt, but it got to the point where Gorn/Iron were spewing too many &quot;exagerations&quot;(at best).  If you guys really want whats best for RE, you wouldnt brush off what so many people are telling you.  <br>
<br>
Good luck.  (not sarcastic) <p><a href='http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=248327'>Birren Anklebiter</a><BR>
