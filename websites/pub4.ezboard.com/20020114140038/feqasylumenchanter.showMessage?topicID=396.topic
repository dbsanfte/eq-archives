I havent done shrooms single group but i know i could with little difficulty.<br>
<br>
Lineup...<br>
<br>
I would use <br>
<br>
ToT<br>
Swap (slow default if no shaman, but shaman definately preferred)<br>
Root (immobilize or mabye even paralyzing earth)<br>
Glamor of Kintaz<br>
Flux<br>
Slant<br>
Tash<br>
Dazzle<br>
<br>
Thats what i would use off the top of my head.  If i have a shaman ( preferrable ), i would put charm (boltrans) in swap.<br>
<br>
I dont think too many of the shrooms are 56+ (adepts and reavers ? you shroom experts let us know ), so you dont have to use GoK on all the shroom, only the 56+ ones.<br>
<br>
If you have anyone down there that is level 56, get them to /con all incomming mobs and say level as soon as they can (if its even to them, you will need GoK on that particular mob).<br>
<br>
I would tash the shrooms, as i hear they have decent MR and tash will help you land spells on them, and you need to stun the healing ones to keep them from healing themselves ( thus slant, for the larger range and still relatively fast casting time, over shift , whose area is too small, or skew, whose casting time is too slow )<br>
<br>
I hear the king is almost impossible to land a slow spell on .. mabye a 60 shaman with malo + tash can do it easier ?  I guess you just tank him down, and try to prevent any other shrooms from healing him by mezzing them.<br>
<br>
I know Root is good Crowd Control down here, and root parking non healing shrooms works pretty well.  If they are slowed, and parked, they dont need to be mezzed and can save you a lot of mana.<br>
<br>
The only reason i havent gone to shrooms, is because its not that good exp, and i would like a cloak for arodan.  If i go, i either want to go in a group of my friends so that i know i wont get screwed on &quot;NEED&quot; on the tunic, or,  would allow me to roll on one if they didnt &quot;need&quot; it ( ie shaman, or monk).<br>

<br>
For a good challenge with good exp, do DN <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  occasionally you can get a very nice loot or two out of there with just one group.<br>

Aside from what Llorian posted, the only thing I would mention is some general info on GoK... given a little bit of bad luck, GoK is one of yer worst nightmares. At somethin like 375 mana a pop, for a mere 24ish seconds, things can escalate quickly. Recently, was killing stuff in DN (where, unlike shrooms, it seems a lot of the stuff needs GoK/rapture) and had *5* GoK resisted in succession. /bye mana.<br>
<br>
In other words, I'd definitely keep root handy <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  If you have a good puller shrooms wouldn't be hard really... but inexperienced ones will make you work <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Istrahd, don't listen to the nay-sayers.<br>
<br>
I have spent untold hours at the shroom camp, starting at level 56.  Level 56 was pretty low... back then I would have a higher (level 59) shaman and a level 60 tank to pull to even things out.  Nowadays though, I can go down there with no shaman and lower level tanks and still pull the king spawn.<br>
<br>
It's true about Glamour of Kintaz - that spell sucks.  It's like a &quot;necessary evil&quot; spell, I guess it's better than not being able to mez at all.<br>
<br>
Remember, the myconid warriors and myconid preists are both always Dazzle-able.  The myconid adepts and myconid reavers may POSSIBLY need GOK.  I've found that only 1 out of every 4 or 5 reavers or adepts need GOK.  If you are of the appropriate level you could just con them and see, but I don't have a problem any more with firing off Dazzle once, seeing the &quot;can't be mezzed by this spell&quot; message, then firing off GOK.<br>
<br>
At 57 you're going to get beat down pretty badly and have some resists.  One school of thought says just tash first, take the beating and try to channel out mez.  This strategy doesn't sit well with me though and even in my earlier days I tried dazzle first.  Some enchanters go by either stategy though.  At 60 I *never* have to tash first.  I'll Dazzle, if resisted I tash while Dazzle is refreshing then try again.<br>
<br>
Take a level 57+ shaman down there with you the first couple of times until you get the hang of things.  Just swap out your usual druid evacer for him because you can just zone out down there.  After a few trips and another level, you may not even need the shaman any more and you could Forlorn Deeds everything also.  I have no trouble keeping up with mana down there for slows, GOKs, whatever. (I guess epic helps)<br>
<br>
Memming root might be a good idea, simply because you're going to have a much easier time channeling it out at your level (or any level for that matter) than a GOK.  When I do one group juggers I use Fetter basically as a swap out for GOK.  Since 1 group takes a bit of time to kill a Jugger, you don't want to stand there and use GOK 6 or 7 times on him to keep him mezzed.  Better to just Fetter, tash, slow.<br>
<br>
I think I got off on several different tangents... let me know how you do down there <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Oh one last thing, make sure you figure out BEFOREHAND how you will roll on any fungal regen tunics that drop.  I have seen more arguments over this item then maybe any other.  Whenever *I'm* in a group, I say simply that the tunic will be an item all 6 people in the group roll on no matter what.  Since the Shroom camp is slightly more exciting to me then a Karnor moat group, and I am level 60, there's really no other reason for me to be down there.  Whenever anyone has disagreed, I said okay cool, go ahead and grab another enchanter.  That always shuts em up :P<br>

<br>
That aside, at 57 shrooms will be tough to do without a shaman. You'll probably need to tash everything for a mez to hit, and somone else slowing will make a world of difference. Make sure you DON'T camp someplace near a major shroom highway (Pretty much anywhere near king)- though 7 add fights are lots of fun, you won't be able to handle them at 57 and even at 60 luck runs out sometime. <br>
<br>
Keep one thing in mind: About half of adepts are 55+, and though you can dazzle most of them, the 55+ ones will not be stunnable, even though you get the message. And Adepts don't do anything but try and get off CHs once they hit 50%, so mez interrupts are very effective against them. You really don't need an Adept CHing 4 times while you're holding down two shrooms, one of them requiring GoK (I've had this happen, ugh). <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uqueldarya.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Queldarya</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>w4nn4b3!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(7/5/01 11:17:23 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Enchanters and Shrooms</span><hr size=1> (Edited to poke fun at Errtai)<br>

<br>
Rapture is a VILE spell.  Any spell where that competes with ToT for recast time is VILE.  (Okie, maybe I'm exaggering that recast time a bit, but it's still vile.)<br>
<br>
Shrooms.  I end up in shrooms a lot for some reason.  I usually load:<br>
Dazzle<br>
Tash<br>
Memblur<br>
Two AE stuns<br>
GoK<br>
Either a dispel or a slow spell<br>
<br>
*  I'm not 100% sure what spells shrooms buff themselves with, but it seems that I get less resists after I hit them with a dispell, so I think there's cleric mobs which cast a RM spell of some sort (Adepts, Priests).  While I'm not a 100% certain, I think there's shaman types who also haste shrooms.  Try mez'ing first, if you get a resist, try dispelling.<br>
<br>
*  Shrooms hit hard and fast, and the higher level ones have long memories like Ilis and Reet frogs, so it's always nice to have a memblur so you can sit down and med during multiple add situations (and to have the shrooms leave the cleric alone).<br>
<br>
*  I occasionally load a slow, but usually 55+ shaman you didn't even know existed will come boiling out of the woodwork if they hear the phrase &quot;shroom camp&quot;, so having a shaman usually isn't a big problem.<br>
<br>
* It's difficult, almost impossible, to land most spells on the King (including slow).  I usually dispell it, wait a bit, then tash it, and let the shaman try and land a slow.  I believe the King is also a melee-range casting mob, so get close if you're going to try slowing it.  I simply concentrate on CC'ing any adds (and charm tanking, if you're comfortable with charming mobs, I usually don't have the mana to spare).  If your party isn't familiar with the King camp, explain this to them, so the cleric will know to be near FM.<br>
<br>
- As a side note, there's a neat way to effectively single pull the King.  Since the King has a larger aggro radius than the other shrooms he shares his little podium with, you can aggro one of the lower-level wanderers who pass &quot;behind&quot; the King, and that will get you two shrooms instead of three higher level ones at once.<br>

The odd adept/reaver will need GoK/Rapture (56+ like he said). These Adepts will not be able to be stunned by normal stuns, you can use Sieve or GoK to try to stop them from CHing.<br>
Wheover Queldarya is she's a freak too, memblur sucks. So does dispel. Try to mez, dispell if resisted? You'll be getting beat on. And why not just tash? If you have a shaman they'll be slowed by then, if not you won't have a slot for it.<br>

And yes, I've camped the king from all sorts of places, usually we hang out in that little alcove near the stand where he spawns.  I was just saying that you don't need an evacer for this camp because when it's time to go, the zone-out pad is near.  And yeah, it is funny how the shamen come out of the woodwork for a shroom group.<br>
<br>
Phant: don't forget about when you weren't level 60, I know you've been 60 for a while.  But sometimes you have to do some extra tricks when you're lower (like root instead of GOK)<br>
<br>
I'm glad someone else brought up adept and how the higher level ones cannot be stunned.  It sucks because unless you had a Dazzle not work, it's hard to tell if they will be unstunnable until they start CHing even though they're not resisting your fluxes.  The best bet to interrupt CH's is probably GOK (works on the Emperror too in crypt to stop gate), I don't reccomend mana sieving because he'll still probably get off at least 2 before he runs out of mana.<br>
<br>
About the king - he is a paladin and will usually LOH once, and cast superior (or is it greater?) heal on himself when he's low.<br>
I have slowed him with Tashanian and Malo (level 60 shaman) on, but never had any luck with anything else.  I know for sure Tashanian and occulusion of sound wouldn't let me slow.<br>
<br>
I'm 99% sure he isn't a &quot;melee only&quot; cast mob like a fire giant, because I have used theft of thought at him at long range.  I know that I can't ToT mobs that are melee-only-casting.<br>

And I would recommend Sieve for Adepts over GoK depending on your melee. About 20 minutes ago, had a 57 war and 60 monk for melee and I coulda easily ran the thing oom instead of blowing 4 bubs interrupting CH with GoK and then having it CH anyway <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :/ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":/"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><font size=72 color=#336699>KAMUKUK is my god. thank you kamukuk!!!! love you~</font></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ualundraadjani.showPublicProfile?language=EN>AlundraAdjani</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I live here.... get out.</span><br> <font color=#000033>(7/6/01 2:50:35 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://alundraadjani.com/otherstuff/eq/catface.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Enchanters and Shrooms</span><hr size=1> If  you go down there without a shaman, expect to be low on mana a lot...and this is coming from someone who has an epic.  Lately it has seemed worse than normal...but I have been getting a TON  of resists down there, on mezzing, slowing, and rooting (rooting = my mem blur of choice), leaving me with little or no mana most of the time.  It's very rare that you get more than one un-dazzleable shroom at once, so I usually just tell the group to swap targets instead of blowing more mana on gok.<br>
<br>
I can't imagine sieving the unstunnable healers to be mana efficient.  If it's unstunnable I'll have the tanks push, and that will interrupt most CH attempts, and if I see it cast and several seconds go by then I'll use GoK to interrupt.  But if one CH goes off it's not the end of the world, it's just a few more minutes tanking a slowed baddy. :P<br>
<br>
I have also had the king resist ToT before.  Only slow I've seen stick on him was a high level shammy slow after tash and malo.  I usually don't  even bother casting anything on the king besides tash. <p><img src="http://www.annastazia.homestead.com/files/adjani.jpg" alt="Adjani Tristesse, Goddess of Lanys"></img>

Wasn't so bad.<br>
<br>
I didn't have to use GoK ... I kinda did like Adjani said - we seen the Reaver - and the tanks took the high lvl one first instead of jacking around with it.<br>
<br>
I guess I need a real bad experience before I truly respect the shrooms ... though I obviously am not cocky about it now.<br>
<br>
I am sure I will get more experience as time goes on ...<br>

In short, I believe it is the most perfectly balanced place in the game for a single six man group of players of level 55 or greater. I have done them many many different ways. <br>
<br>
When we first started dong shrooms we camped mainly at the exit. Then again most of us(Soul Assassins, aka:Conquest) were still around level 54 when we were doing this. However, when we camped at the exit like that we always missed a couple of king pulls because we would just get overwhelmed with mobs and had to rest up between fights too long. To alleviate this we moved our camps directly into his room, usually along the wall right across from the water. This turned out to be the ideal place it seemed. The only thing we really had to worry about was pushing mobs into that wall while fighting because the cleric shrooms on the other side would CH if we did. All in all we found this spot got the fewest trains.<br>
<br>
As for tactics, you name it we did it. The tactics were mainly driven by the group makeup. We had some groups with 2 enchanters where we used charm extensively. Those were the most fun I think. Anytime you had a shaman with you, it freed you up to charm some of the lower level warriors as well. This made fighting there a lot of fun. Of course we also did a lot of the standard heavy tank groups where your primary focus was controlling the pace of the battle and buffing. No tactic is the &quot;right&quot; tactic to use. There are always plenty of alternatives to use depending on group makeup.<br>
<br>
I think the most fun I had there was once when Mordeccaii, Dyneiko, and myself all went there and we were each playing two characters. I was enc/clr, Mord was enc/rog, and Dyneiko was War/Dru. I think we got 3 or 4 fungi tunics that day. Of course, anytime I had the opportunity to play two characters at once, it was challenging and more fun then it sounds <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> . <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ueqmirrorqueen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>eqmirrorqueen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>p0\/\/3r-p0sT3r!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(7/7/01 1:19:34 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Enchanters and Shrooms</span><hr size=1> Hehe, someday I might actually go to this camp.

And earlier, when I said to keep root up, I didn't mean to root park over mez. Like adjani said, you can use root to sorta mem blur. So long as root holds for longer than a few seconds, it's just as effective for all intents and purposes. (use #4873 for root, my favorite line of spells)<br>

<br>
GoK- I have used this as crowd control once during this time.  You will almost never have 2_ 56 mobs in the camp at once, just call a switch.  I do use it to interrupt complete heal.<br>
<br>
tactics- I am a huge_ advocate of bringing a krup with you to this camp, a dual wielding hasted krup and you dont even need to slow really if youre lom and you will basicly make like 90% of the xp you would at an xp camp.  We typically plow 20+ shrooms a cycle with krup and ragebringer rogue in group, most will die in under a minute.  The reason you dont have to slow is the krup will tank 80% of the time with the new pet aggros, and with his ~10k hps will need less healing than you would on a regular warrior with_ slow.  Usually needs a cheal once every 2-3 shrooms.  Now when this will suck is when you are dealing with shroom mez resists (which will happen fairly often) and the charm breaks, but if you have a group that is heads up about the charm and helps you out it will usually be ok.  To tell the truth I dont even use slow at this camp I would rather have a mana reserve for controlling the krup.<br>
<br>
    You will see alot of chealers wander by, these piss me off I will usually just tash them in and mez them if I see them, would rather have it in the camp than stealth healing.<br>
<br>
root- I keep this up always and use it on basicly everything, the mana you gain form being able to med right away is &gt; the cost of the spell, and it not running around beating healers is nice too.<br>
<br>
tash- tash everything, enspecially if not all of your stunners are high level, 56 and lower will have a hard time stunning if it isnt tashed, even I have trouble at 59 on about 1/3 of them without tash.<br>
<br>
I dont know what else to say, basicly shissared krup will out taunt any real player in your group and is &gt; than even shroom king with heals, play your group as a charm vehicle and you wont have much trouble.<br>
<br>
