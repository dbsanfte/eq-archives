If it’s a small town robbery or a national manhunt, it must be VERY difficult to coordinate and execute a plan of action that is fruitful. The examples could go on and on I know.<br>
<br>
Also, I would like to say that am fully aware of the fact that one man, the president, is not responsible. Rather Clinton, Bush or JKF, they all have a very hard job to do daily. Obviously the &quot;point man&quot;, or president, is the one the blame / shame falls on (and should in some cases). The administration in whole and to coordination of such is the key to most answers and problems.<br>

<br>
I agree with this statement to a certain extent. Sometimes we must be &quot;mums the word&quot; in order to catch the bad guys. However, there is a CONSIDERABLE risk in playing by this rule...and 9-11 is the perfect example. Also, it wasn’t the case with the &quot;suspects&quot; of 9-11....we really had no clues as to exactly who they were. Unlike in Lurikeen's example, the FBI was not keeping tabs on the 9-11 terrorist (spy’s).<br>
<br>
The thinking in &quot;lets not tell anyone for fear of panic or tip-off&quot; works in many cases. Recently in Okla., there was a manhunt for an escaped detainee. The police chief came on the news and said that they really didn’t know where this guy was....2 hours later the escapee was arrested. They didn’t want to tip the guy off and cause him to run. It worked out fine in not telling the public that he may have been in someone's backyard. The reason they didn’t is cause he wasn’t a &quot;violent&quot; criminal and they most likely didn’t consider him armed and dangerous. In that case their plan worked..the &quot;hush hush&quot; plan.<br>
<br>
Since 9-11, we have in place a nice little color-coded warning system. I am guessing that somewhere out there there is a set of cautions attached to each of these colors. &quot;White&quot; for example may mean they have no reason at all to think that something may happen. Red on the other hand may mean &quot;don’t leave your house today&quot;. 3000+ people had to die in order to finally put something like this in place. Why, with all the evidence and information, did we not already have this, or something like this, in place prior to 9-11?<br>
<br>
Post 9-11 has changed the way we live indeed. Yet the threat is and has been the same since what..about 1993? <br>
<br>
The downed aircraft (I can’t remember which flight it was) was brought down by men who had found out via cell phone that planes were being crashed into buildings. This more the likely saved the Whitehouse from being destroyed. In other words...they had warning where as the other people aboard the other airliners had no clue.<br>
<br>
A general alert would have worked fine. A simple &quot;We have reason to believe......yadda.....fly at your own risk&quot; would have at LEAST tipped some people off when the hijackings began. A generalized alert may have kept the terrorist from hijacking that day, but also may have prevented it all together.<br>
<br>
Hindsight is 20/20 I know....but what about foresight? Can we not trust the American people enough to give them warning? Does anyone really think that if they would have issued a general alert or warning that people would have panicked and went nuts? Is it the economy we are protecting moreso then a few hundred people? <br>
<br>
I do not accept the theory that they intended to remain silent in order to catch the terrorist especially since they didn’t know who they were. But what they DID know, or have strong evidence about, is that something was in the making! Something that involved the POTIENTIAL death of at LEAST one airliner full of people....and they didn’t say a word.<br>
<br>
Guys, I'm thinking that it’s better to be safe then sorry. If they had known the terrorist and were monitoring them, that’s one thing....but they (claim) they did not. Since they did not, they should have issued a generalized alert to people...at the very least.<br>
<br>
I’m doing some research on some more &quot;conspiracy&quot;.. I will post it once I complete it.. Its very interesting.<br>

Do you sit tight on that information? Do you pass it out? How reliable is the information? How often can you pass that information out and avoid a &quot;boy who cried wolf&quot; syndrome? If you offer enough general warnings people will eventually just ignore them. There is a fine balance to be struck there. There are no clear rules that apply to this kind of thing. <br>
<br>
<br>
Bottom line, law enforcement's job is to protect the public, sometimes in spite of the public's actions or desires. I know that sounds kind of arrogant but, it is simple fact. Does law enforcement have all the answers? Nope, sure don't. They do they have in most cases at the very least training to deal with situations and in many cases years of dealing with people, situations and experiences that help them do better work to take preventive measures without stepping on the toes of the constitution or the general public. <br>
<br>
I will tell you this, what you see on the local news &quot;crime beat&quot; stories are the tip of the iceberg of what is actually going on in your city. I will give you a perfect example of what I meant by public panic. It does not actually have to be riots and people running in the streets screaming. When the Anthrax mail was first discovered it was HIGHLY publicized our department was FLOODED with calls about every suspicious person, envelope, package, etc. We were called to corners where a UPS or FedEx guy set down a package for a minute while he delivered something else. Of course we have to take these calls serious but, every cook, freak, nut and whacko had a call to make about something, reapetedly. We simply did not have the personel to handle this AND our regular duties. As a result, burglaries, auto thefts, entering autos, etc. rose substantially during this period. Was it a good thing that the Anthrax threat was publicized, in hindsight, yes but it does have results which may not be palatable to most poeple. I am just guessing here but, I bet you would be surpised at how OFTEN something like this most likley crosses any president's desk pre or post 9/11. 99% of the time it is road apples 1% of the time it is not. How do you make a general public notice without desensitizing people? You make these warnings when you have evidence that something will occur or has a very strong possiblity to occur. If not, you simply do not have enough to warrant any ation that is not &quot;behind the scenes&quot; so to speak.<br>

<br>
Weren't they? I seem to have read that some of them had been watched for at least days prior.<br>
<br>
<i>"Obviously the "point man", or president, is the one the blame / shame falls on (and should in some cases)."</i><br>
<br>
I agree. However, we can't then point fingers at Clinton, realistically. The man is not in office and it is up to the Bush administration to clean up, if Clinton left a mess.<br>
<br>
<i>"Hindsight is 20/20 I know....but what about foresight? Can we not trust the American people enough to give them warning?"</i><br>
<br>
I totally see where you are coming from on this Rheaton. It is difficult enough to see our fellow countrymen and countrywomen slaughtered before our eyes, then to later find out that there was possibly a chance this could have been avoided <i><b>if</b></i>______ *fill in the blank with theory of choice as to why and where the government dropped the ball*.<br>
<br>
I think Lith expressed the difficulty with conditional thinking in these cases. "Conditional thinking" is simply "what if" thinking. We are provided the antecedent for the condition usually from an external source and then iterate consequents for the statement usually to our own loss of sanity. We all know 911 happened and no amount of working through "what ifs" will change it or prevent it in the future. I believe that external threats to the US from rational agents are very hard to predict. Notice, not impossible.<br>
<br>
I believe that the best predictions will result from the fruits of empirical studies (information and fact gathering) of terrorist groups. Even then, I can only guess that such studies would not have given the US enough certainty as to whether or not a 9/11 was in progress. I think we could only know that one was possible. Given the political climate and popularity of tax cuts and slashing the federal budget I doubt seriously the US can find the funds necessary to be proactive and implement preventative measure against terrorist attacks. Even the ramped up airport security is a joke and not a real solution. The difficulty may be in knowing what is the solution. <p><center><font face="arial" color="CCFFFF">Lurikeen Mali'Kyre</FONT></center><center><table style='Filter: Shadow(Color=#150517, Direction=225)'><tr><td><span class='Necromancer'><font size=2 color="red" face="arial"><i>NECROMANCER</span></td></tr></table></font></i></center><center><font face=arial></center><center><I>"Resident Prick with a degree in being a Jerk!"</I></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/urheaton.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Rheaton</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 175<br> <font color=#E9D756>(5/21/02 8:10:28 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=299.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Just fvcking tell us, Ok?!</span><hr size=1> I am by no means trying to say its all Clinton's fault.

<br>
Too much bureaucracy and there isn't anyone who is coordinating anything!  And we pay these people?  Ok, so some drug traffickers fall through the cracks and get away...perhaps someone robbed a series of banks and went on the lamb and got away... BUT these guys, the CIA - FBI - ETC, are suppose to be there for the big things...they are suppose to know..thats their job. Period. And with information right in front of the faces, right under their noses, didn't and couldn't do one thing to stave off the worst terrorist attack US history!<br>
<br>
Perhaps we blame the system...perhaps we pin the blame on someone for missing some small detail..OR  maybe, just maybe we change the whole fvcking thing, fire who needs to be fired...hire people who will do their jobs and protect this country the way they should.<br>
<br>
Here is an article dated Sept. 18th 2001 (7 days after the attacks)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>
MANILA, Philippines (CNN) -- The FBI was warned six years ago of a terrorist plot to hijack commercial planes and slam them into the Pentagon, the CIA headquarters and other buildings, Philippine investigators told CNN. <br>
<br>
Philippine authorities learned of the plot after a small fire in a Manila apartment, which turned out to be the hideout of Ramzi Yousef, who was later convicted for his role in the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center. Yousef escaped at the time, but agents caught his right-hand man, Abdul Hakim Murad, who told them a chilling tale. <br>
<br>
&quot;Murad narrated to us about a plan by the Ramzi cell in the continental U.S. to hijack a commercial plane and ram it into the CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia, and also the Pentagon,&quot; said Rodolfo Mendoza, a Philippine intelligence investigator. <br>
<br>
Philippine investigators also found evidence targeting commercial towers in San Francisco, Chicago and New York City. <br>
<br>
They said they passed that information on to the FBI in 1995, but it's not clear what was done with it. <br>
<br>
One week ago, two hijacked commercial jets slammed into the World Trade Center, collapsing the towers. Another jet hit the Pentagon and a fourth crashed in rural Pennsylvania. Authorities believe that fourth jet may have been headed for the Capitol or the White House. Thousands were killed in the attacks. <br>
<br>
On Monday, FBI Director Robert Mueller insisted the agency had &quot;no warning signs&quot; of last week's attacks. <br>
<br>
Yousef and Murad both have ties to Osama bin Laden, the man President Bush has labeled the &quot;prime suspect&quot; in Tuesday's attacks. <br>
<br>
Authorities also found on a computer in the Manila apartment details of a separate plot to bomb 11 U.S. airliners on overseas flights. <br>
<br>
Yousef once listed his occupation as &quot;international terrorist&quot; on an ID card, and he has long been considered a disciple of bin Laden. <br>
<br>
Murad was a pilot who admitted he had been trained in Afghanistan as well as the United States. Bin Laden, a Saudi native, lives in Afghanistan. <br>
<br>
&quot;(Murad) was principally recruited by Yousef's group and bin Laden's group to undertake a suicide mission,&quot; said Avelino Razon, superintendent for the Philippine National Police. <br>
<br>
Yousef was eventually caught in Pakistan and brought to New York for trial. He was sentenced to life in prison. Murad is also serving a life sentence. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

<br>
&quot;While jet fighters drop bombs on Afghanistan in the wake of the World Trade Center tragedy and FBI agents search for the source of anthrax letters, an incredible tale has been unfolding in a Toronto courtroom. <br>
  <br>
It draws together the threads of a narrative some describe as &quot;stunning and fantastic,&quot; while others wonder if it isn't just the ravings of a lunatic. <br>
  <br>
The man telling the tale in sworn court affidavits is Delmart Edward Vreeland, who faces credit fraud charges in Canada and in the United States, where officials are attempting to extradite him. <br>
  <br>
The 35-year-old American claims to be a lieutenant in a U.S. Navy intelligence unit - a spy who says he knew in advance about the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. <br>
  <br>
In his affidavit, he says he tried to warn Canadian intelligence about possible terrorist attacks on New York and the Pentagon, along with targets in Ottawa and Toronto, but was written off as a petty criminal. <br>
  <br>
So he wrote the warning on a piece of paper, sealed it in an envelope, and handed it to jail guards a month before the attacks. They opened the letter Sept. 14 and immediately forwarded the information to Ottawa. <br>
  <br>
His lawyers, Rocco Galati and Paul Slansky, are fighting extradition, telling the court he could face treason charges and the death penalty in the U.S. <br>
  <br>
In the first stage of hearings, federal prosecutor Kevin Wilson yesterday told Mr. Justice Archie Campbell of the Superior Court of Justice that he was skeptical of Vreeland's claims. <br>
  <br>
&quot;Is his story possible? I can't go so far as to say it's not possible, but it's not plausible,&quot; Wilson said. <br>
  <br>
The prosecutor said he has seen no evidence to back Vreeland's claim that Canadian embassy official Marc Bastien was murdered in Moscow in December. Canadian officials said the 35-year-old computer specialist died of natural causes. <br>
  <br>
So, who is Delmart Edward Joseph Michael Vreeland II? <br>
  <br>
According to court documents, Vreeland was 18 when he enlisted in the U.S. Navy in 1984. <br>
  <br>
Two years later, Vreeland says in his affidavit, he joined a special unit investigating drug smuggling into the U.S. by naval personnel. But the navy says Vreeland was &quot;unsatisfactorily discharged&quot; in 1986. <br>
  <br>
Vreeland also claims he gathered information on a crime family in Detroit and testified against them in 1998. <br>
  <br>
Late last year, he says, he came to Canada to help smuggle Russian military secrets out of Moscow, including Russia's plan to counter the American 'Star Wars' missile defence system. While in Moscow, Vreeland says, he met Bastien. <br>
  <br>
Vreeland was arrested by a police fugitive squad nine months ago. While in Toronto (Don) Jail, he met Nestor Fonseca, who was facing drug smuggling charges and extradition to the U.S. The court documents say Fonseca allegedly told Vreeland of his plans to kill a Toronto judge and others. Fonseca was charged with counselling to commit murder. <br>
  <br>
Galati and Slansky said in the documents that Vreeland should be put into the witness protection program in Canada because he is the main witness against Fonseca. <br>
  <br>
Galati writes in one document: &quot;Neither myself, nor Mr. Slansky ... have seen anything as incomprehensibly frustrating, inexplicable and irresponsibly absurd. as the RCMP's position that they are not interested in reviewing Mr. Vreeland's information.&quot; <br>
  <br>
It would appear, Galati says in the brief, that the Canadian and American governments have written Vreeland off as a &quot;nut case,&quot; which he says is a &quot;patently absurd conclusion.&quot; <br>
  <br>
