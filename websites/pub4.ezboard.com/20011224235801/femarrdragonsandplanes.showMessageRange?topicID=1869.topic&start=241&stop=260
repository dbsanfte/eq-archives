And by year end, it will be higher still thanks to Luclin.<br>
<br>
People need to take off the &quot;Verant Hater&quot; cap and think about this from a logical, non-emotional, point of view.  Even Ultima Online continues to grow after all of these years!  All of the games mentioned (AO, SB, DaOC, etc.) are not that close to release.  The day they are actually ON the shelf and not just &quot;coming soon&quot;, EQ will lose a percentage of it's population just like UO did when EQ came out.  In the long run, however, EQ will continue to attract new customers as long as the game remains fresh.  This is a very young market and, thus far, it has barely been tapped. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ulargebarukungukbarsh.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Large Barukungukbarsh</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 7<br> <font color=#E9D756>(4/30/01 7:40:53 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Grin</span><hr size=1> Much &lt;3 for the list!

DAoC is in beta 3 already and is slated to come out in August.  AO and Shadowbane are slated for a October and November release, respectively.  Also, I forgot to mention Neverwinter Nights which is gonna be a hit on it's own, though slightly different then the rest.  I'm saying the EQ player population will go down because up until now, EQ only had to compete with UO for the MMORPG gamer population.  Logically, when more MMORPG games are out, obviously it's gonna pull some gamers away from the already established MMORPG games out there.  Look what EQ did to UO when it first came out.  <br>
<br>
Mind you, it's not as if UO and EQ have gone unoticed to the rest of the gaming world.  It's not like the MMORPG gamer population will explode/ballon when all these new game choices come out.  We've already past that stage of explosive growth in the MMORPG gamer population when UO/EQ were first popularized/publicized.  Of course, more people are going to join this genre and the growth will continue but it's simply not gonna keep up with all these new games coming out.  For example, Quake.  Everyone will agree that Quake was THE established online shooter game a few years back yes?  Well, after a while, Unreal, Half-Life, Alien vs Predator came out and now, the Quake/Quake 3 population is merely a fraction of its former self.  <br>
<br>
This are the reasons why I said EQ population will decline.  I know that EQ won't die out for many years to come but I just don't believe the growth will continue when more and more competition comes out.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uealan01.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ealan01</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 78<br> <font color=#E9D756>(4/30/01 8:19:59 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: All your servers are belong to us Überscore - 4/22</span><hr size=1> Not that it really matters, but DaOC has a tentative release date of &quot;Fall 2001&quot; (according to their FAQ).  Obviously, it will be a miracle if any of these new games are actually released on-time (nothing wrong with that, it's a miracle when ANY game is released on time), and 6 months will only be November.  Basically, all of these games would have to not slip at all to make it in time for Christmas (it's a minimum of one month from RTM to actual product on the shelf).<br>
<br>
As for the explosive growth thing, I completely and totally disagree.  This genre goes back WAY before UO and EQ (and Asherons Call which you forgot and is a competitor that EQ has already done well against).  Those were just the first games to have mass appeal.  It may very well be that there are quite a few periods of explosive growth left since all of the games populations *combined* total less than 1 million.<br>
<br>
Either way, my point is that I really seriously doubt there will be a 100,000 (1/3) person exodus from EQ in 6 months.  BUT, it has nothing to do with this thread and it's all speculation anyway, so I'll stop talking. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/utelivaksk.showPublicProfile?language=EN>TelivakSK</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#E9D756>(4/30/01 9:00:34 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: All your servers are belong to us Überscore - 4/22</span><hr size=1> Welp, you're right, I forgot AC but the point I made is there.  The gamer population is well over a million actually since EQ boast a claim of 300,000 subscribers alone.  Considering Starcraft and Quake 3 still have about 200,000+ players world wide total, I think it's not unreasonable to assume that when combined with all the other online games out there, the total will easily reach 1 million, if not 2 millions.  As for the 6 months stuff, well, that's definately dependent on the studios which make the games.  Shrugs, maybe by the end of the year would be a better time frame for this dicussion.<br>
<br>
Nextly, the reason why I said the most explosive growth period for MMORPG is over is because, games like EQ/AC/UO tapped a previously left-out pool of population when it comes to online-gaming.  If you noticed, 90% of the online gamers prior to EQ/AO/UO were male, between the age of 12-30.  Basically, young professionals and students who are well-accustomed to technology and the online gaming genre.  Furthermore, a good portion of this population are the same people who played MUDDs, which gave them a introduction of sorts to MMORPG games.  <br>
<br>
EQ/UO/AC tapped the female, family pool of gamers like no other online game have before.  You can't really take the entire population of the computer world into account because like it or not, many people who have never played any computer games before prolly never will.  Not to sound sexist or anything but many women I know will never ever play play hardcore computer games(not counting Solitaire, minesweeper and stuff).  Computer games only appeal to a small portion of the population and that's a fact.  Most gamers now-a-days jump from one game to another.  It is uncommon we see completely new gamers who have never played any computer games before.  Well, that is up until EQ/AC/UO but as I've said, this is pretty much the last pool of the population computer gaming can tap if you rule out the senior citizens and pre-teen children population.<br>
<br>
The other factor in determining computer gaming population is society.  We're still light years away from everyone being completely receptive to computer games and the entertainment value they bring.  I mean, as long as we have so called &quot;expert&quot; condemning &quot;computer game addictation&quot; and people perceiving computer games as &quot;geeky&quot;, we'll never have a total acceptance of computer games amongst the population.  People are slowly coming around but there are still many people who'll never play any computer games.  It's not like you can force them to play, it's a preference thing.  Some people take enjoyment in computer gaming, some people don't.  Right now, most of the population in the countries of the world which computers are common, don't take enjoyment in computer gaming and that's prolly the way it's gonna be.  There's nothing you can say or do that'll change their mind so there's one obstacle for anymore.. explosive growth.<br>
<br>
Lasly, we've already experienced explosive growth during the MUDD era, the Doom2/Quake era and Warcraft2/Starcraft/Total Annihilation/Command&amp;Conquer/Age of Empire era, how much longer can you really expect to continue?  Almost every single genre of computer gaming has been covered.  First person shooter, third person action, real time strat, turn base strat, online RPG, one person RPG, sports sims, flight sims, and combat sims.  You name the genre, it's been established by at least several games.  Oh sure more games will come out that are variations of the existing genres but you're gonna see anything completely revolutionary anymore.  We'd sooner run out of people than games when it comes to online gaming.<br>
<br>
The fact of the matter remains that, as if now, and prolly for the next several years, computer games will only appeal to a minority of the population.  The gaming industry is so trendy, what's hot for one year, may not be so a year later.  That's precisely why I don't see a explosive growth coming anytime soon.   <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/utelivaksk.showPublicProfile?language=EN>TelivakSK</A> at: 4/30/01 9:27:21 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ukyphe.showPublicProfile?language=EN>kyphe</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#E9D756>(4/30/01 9:51:10 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: All your servers are belong to us Überscore - 4/22</span><hr size=1> /em flexes.<br>

<br>
Add in pvp kills too score and see who wins. Try fighting for almost every zone or mob you want. So many factors you need you lack for a truthful study. You in no way allowed a fair and equal scoring system for the diff servers. Its alot easier to sign a list and zone into PoH, WW, or PoH with no threat of pvp move on to your guild objective. Try fighting through forces almost equal to your own, using only the gear your able to get by fighting other players for, and doing your whole raid while keeping ready for the fact that someone else could come along and challenge you for your zone. <br>
<br>
Even each member of the pvp server guilds has to fight harder for what he has. Be it gear or exp. These players in some cases like Team PvPers are restricted from having the best race/classes or even whole classes, yet still doing what others do. So what if it takes them longer, or harder to do it. IMO that just proves that its that much harder to do on PvP servers. Xanit K Ven might not have been first to kill Inny, but by god they did it with PURE evils. No bards, druids, no rangers, no monks. Cleared the plane using SKs to feign death pull and fought tooth and nail to get to him. Silent Souls/Prophets, the 4 team guild on VZ might have the edge of having all classes on a raid. But that too comes with draw backs. They can not use AEs, have pkers attack from all teams, and fight a two sided war against the Evils, and the now Lightie team. Yet they still do great things, like killing the Dain. Then you have the 3 team light side. Whos strongest guild is Defiant. They miss out on having AEs, Troll/Orge Tanks, and other advantages of pure blue servers. They must fight for zones from the other sides, and even the Purist team lighties who stick to the 4 Team system. Even with the lack of gear blue servers enjoy and basic freedom of movement, Defiant has killed CT twice now, completed 6 Warrior epics, 2 Mage epics, 1 Wizard epic, 6-7 Ranger epics, 5 Druid epics, 5 Rogue epics, 2 Bard epics, 7 Shaman, 2 Pally epics, 7 Cleric epics and 3 Ench epics (based of current in guild, not people who left, or people outside guild Defiant has helped).<br>
<br>
IMO your system might be legit (not even sure how you score) if we all played on blue servers. But fact is there are 3 pvp servers out there. And each one has great guilds who go through more than any blue guild yet do not get the same respect. Even little things like faction hits from pvping players can get in the way of PvP server guilds from doing what blues can do. Also pvp server players are slowed down from developing because of the side stream of pvp that goes on. Taking them longer to reach the points blues are at, not because lack of skill, but because time taken from pvp. Look at all a pvp player must learn and go through to get his character higher. He must learn to play his class atleast well in pvp, or face lots of CR time, taking more time from his pve or bluebie activities of character advancement.<br>
<br>
Just the view from a person who has been on Team PvP server almost his whole EQ time. Maybe some day you will come up with a diff scoring system to take in account the diff of blue and pvp servers. Or maybe you will come up with a diff system to rate pvp guilds on a diff chart than blues.<br>

That's your own damn fault, not anyone elses.  Don't tell me you're naive enough to think that there's actually such thing as &quot;roleplaying&quot; in this game.  Please, you roleplay anyway you wish because Verant has given us such latitude and flexibility on that matter to make the whole system non-existent.  Why do you think they're trying to make a roleplaying server?  It's simply because they realized their folly and that their old so called &quot;roleplaying&quot; system enforced by faction is BS and never worked like a proper roleplaying game should.  This is why I never even looked into trying to PVP server because I know it's gonna be a whole lot of non-sense with no reasoning for it.

When you post a list ranking  for fun or not it is expected to have people express agreement or not only a total fuckwad would get angry about anyone who disagrees.<br>
<br>
The list is certainly not an accurate representation of uberness now or 3-6 months from now that much is pretty obvious. The list is nice peice of work not sure what it was trying to  list though , could just picked names out of a hat and saved yourself some time.<br>
<br>
Who ever stated Knights of Eternal Good was uber top 10 HAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHA they hadnt even come close to entering  VP nor kill a velious uber mob when the Rathe was split.<br>
<br>
<br>
Someone mentioned anastasia was hardcore or something as she was level 58.... chuckle sorry at this point being level 58 isn't remotely credible as hardcore. I have had 3 level 60 toons for months, if you are not atleast level 60 by now you ain't HARDCORE.<br>
<br>
At anyrate the list was fun/funny as the originator intended, a good joke indeed. In future to prevent mass flames maybe be more clear that the list is simply an innaccurate and fun list you  created for others to enjoy <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uchukzombi.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Chukzombi</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC= http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_star.gif  BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Undead Shaman</span><br>  Posts: 1582<br> <font color=#E9D756>(5/1/01 11:01:19 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: some people are  plain chumps</span><hr size=1> Solarus, i think you are mistaken.
