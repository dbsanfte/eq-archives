Not only have I read that a Zionist is a racist pillaging the lands of the innocent Palestinian people, I have also read that the Christians are hypocritcal mauraders on a never ending quest for bloodshed (the crusades keep comming up for example), to even things so outlandish that Jewish monopolies hold the American media with a iron fist.<br>
<br>
&quot;I only hope that all you fucking God believers [kill]off each other. ALL of you are a plague upon the human race and should die! I am sickened by the hypocricy that I see most &quot;believers&quot; practice.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I said America, not 'Americans'. The American goverment is zionist therefore it is racist, is this hard to understand?&quot;<br>
<br>
Quotes like the ones above truely put a heavy weight upon my heart.  No that is not sarcasm, I am proud to be an American and it disturbs me that my fellow Americans (and even non-Americans) would taint the English language with this hate speech. <br>
<br>
Before I begin my main gripes I believe a introduction is in order.  My avatar for EQ was one called Remedy CureBringer, though many of you new players will not recall that name I believe many veterans will.  My position on religion is none at this momment, I go to Catholic church on Sunday and I go to Hillel on Saturday.  I am a Theology major, duel minor in education and child psychology, and concentration in Rabbidic studdies.  Though I myself do not have a specific religion I believe religion is important for the development of not only children but of the society as a whole.<br>
<br>
First for those who believe the sons and daughters of Jehova, the lambs of the LORD, the believers in the Eternal, the followers of God are plauges brought upon this earth, I have but a few things to say.  You quote scripture, you cite past historical events, you even make outlandish remarks with your only edvidence being the words &quot;obvious,&quot; a phrase containing stupid, or commenting on the age of the a poster who disagrees with your opinions.  That being said let me tackle this one momment at a time.<br>
<br>
First to quote scripture you should have a reasonable background in that specific field in order to fully understand the vague messages and hidden meanings surrounding them (Though I can't stress enough the good that can be picked up from the Bible, Torah, Koran, etc. by non theologists).  Its very well and good you know of Exodus, Leviticus, Lamentations, Psalm 38, Job, Daniel, and that you can pick out a few gem sentances that can back up your presentation, but I believe Shakespeare said it best: &quot;Even the devil can quote scripture.&quot;  <br>
<br>
I believe even one of you brought up a specific notion in Deuteronomy 23, Genesis 19 based upon Sodom, or even more prominent in Leviticus 18:22 &quot;cum masculo non commisceberis coitu femineo quia abominatio est&quot; or the rough english translation: &quot;Do not lie with a man as one lies with a woman; that is detestable.&quot;  Yes reading this you can (and many have) read this as anti-homosexual; and lets face it there is no mis-translations or hidden meanings that can prove this otherwise.  However if you have read all of Deuteronomy, and Leviticus you will also be glad to read that God also condemns the practice of eating rare meat or wearing a fabric from more than one material. The punishment for being a homosexual and wearing a cotton/polyester (sp?) suit is also the same.  This passage has been interpreted by scholars as the &quot;Old Holy Code&quot; meaning that it no longer has any stay in today's standards, so the answer to are Christians or God a homophobe, the answer lies in to the individuals interpretation (and I know many tele-avangelists who wear duel fiber cheap suits!).<br>
<br>
Next is the bloodshed in which the Christians afflict towards... everybody I guess.  The only example you have given me thus far is the Crusades  Lets talk about the Crusades for a momment, the general gist is the Catholic church sent forth a vast army composing of nearly every Catholic nation in Europe to dispose the Holy Land of heathens.  Many innocent people died, and to some point the Crusades even went sofar as a siege on Egypt.  However what is rarely known is the Church did NOT warrent the death of these innocents.  This was done solely by the greed of varioius representatives of the European nations who would rather have gold then save the Holy Land.  The only representative of the Church was that of the Knights Templar lead by Hugh de Payens, and then lastly Jaques de Molay (inbetween there were 21 other &quot;grand masters of the Knights Templar&quot;), Jaques ironically was burned at the stake in 1314 for crimes against the throne of God (basically the crusades got such a bad image they needed a scapegoat).  During the initial crusades the Knights Templar was a specialized unit all sworn to the cloth (thast where the red cross on white cloth armor comes from), the unit was only to be used in either defense or seige of specific symbols of the Catholic Church's choosing.  However Godfray, and others warped the Church's targets and used the Templars to their advantage.  So technically it wasn't the Catholic Church who lead the massacre that was the crusades, but it was the greedy nobility from all of Europe.<br>
<br>
The inquisition on the otherhand was a fanatical group (the Jesuits) who were given too much authority over the matter of conversion.  I do not deny the attrocities commited there.<br>
<br>
Zionism = Racism.<br>
<br>
I believe someone has already clarified this situation but I would like to go deeper into its roots.  As most of us by now have realized that the only radicals that use this comparison are either those who associate themselves with Muslim fundamentalists, and those who still hold anti-Sem feelings (note they are not skinheads, skinheads was a political belief system not baised on the hatred of Jews they were infact created prior to their to the current trend of &quot;skinheads&quot;).<br>
<br>
First if we are going by historical standards Israel's ownership (again consulting the Bible) should belong to the people of God.  Then if you have read Lamentations in combination with Psalm 38 (I believe): (Lamentations 2, verses one and two) 1) ALEPH quomodo obtexit caligine in furore suo Dominus filiam Sion proiecit de caelo terram inclitam Israhel et non recordatus est scabilli pedum suorum in die furoris sui<br>
2) BETH praecipitavit Dominus nec pepercit omnia speciosa Iacob destruxit in furore suo munitiones virginis Iuda deiecit in terram polluit regnum et principes eius.  Which roughly translates that the children of God were invaded and thrown out of Israel forever to be forsaken.  Here is a translation here:<br>
1 <br>
How the Lord has covered the Daughter of Zion with the cloud of his anger! He has hurled down the splendor of Israel from heaven to earth; he has not remembered his footstool in the day of his anger. <br>
2 <br>
Without pity the Lord has swallowed up all the dwellings of Jacob; in his wrath he has torn down the strongholds of the Daughter of Judah. He has brought her kingdom and its princes down to the ground in dishonor. <br>
<br>
So again technically the Israelites owned that area prior to the establishment of Palastine.  But again one could just argue that they were kicked out by God's will and its their fault, read Lamentations and Psalm 38 and you decide.<br>
<br>
Oh and one more important thing, if at any time I have said something to make those I was trying to comment on feel, well stupid for saying it, don't feel that way.  You have the right to say what you want, though I may not agree with it &quot;to the death I will defend your right to say it.&quot;<br>

<br>
At any rate, I think you have come to the wrong place if you want to argue fine points in theology. Certainly tossing around latin phrases will lose much of the game board audience. Further, stating as you have that one must have a "reasonable" (Just what does "reasonable" mean in this case?) background in theology surely rules almost the majority of gamers on Emarr.<br>
<br>
I should also like to mention that your post is rather presumptive and reveals a certain amount of arrogance I believe is condemning. As evidence I need only point you back to your flagrant use of Latin (where not even necessary) and the idea that one must justify their background in the interpretation of scripture in order to have anything of importance to say.<br>
<br>
In my experience the sophmoric approach you have taken is telling that you have just enough knowledge to be dangerous. Those with humility need not toss around credentials or even quote Hebrew, Koine Greek, or Latin to appeal to their interpretations of scripture. When invited they will if able.<br>

Not responding to the religion aspect, but I wanted to say that the original posted did quote some Latin but lets be fair.  People do sometimes give more info than needed for the purpose of letting people know that they are not just speaking blindly.  Sometimes it isn't about bragging, but trying to avoid being passed off as some opinionated fool talking about something of which they don't know.<br>
<br>
He may not be on the right track, but at least he is doing his homework.<br>

<br>
Completely disagree.  Its not the quoting of scripture thats the problem, its the twisting of it to suit the individuals basic needs/desires and spreading that around as truth thats the problem.  If the evil one, commonly called the Father of Lies and Deception, quotes scripture, it sure isn't to spread the truth about God's word.  <br>
<br>
Of course, you seemed to single out the Old Testamant in this post.  I am assuming (/arg I hate doing that) you are aware of what the New Testament says regarding this subject? (i.e. studying scripture specifically and quoting it).  <br>

<br>
There is much debate about the final fate of one of the wonders of the ancient world, the Great Library of Alexandria.  Some say Muslims destroyed it (doubtful from a historical perspective), some say Julius Caesar destroyed it (quite possible), and some say the Christians destroyed it (also quite possible).  <br>
<br>
From what I have read, Caesar destroyed MOST of the great library; fire-ships used in the siege of Alexandria started a nearly city-wide conflagration.  However, the library (or a smaller clone) was rebuilt.  Then comes Cryil, patron saint of arsonists and the son of the bishop of Alexandria at the time, Theosophilus (sp?).  He, in his zealotry, burned the great library, largely because it contained &quot;pagan&quot; works of literature/religion, such as Buddhist writings and Greek writings.  Not only did he destroy the library, but he took the daughter of the library's chief mathematician, flayed her alive, then burned her at the stake as a witch.  She was a teacher at the library and a very learned and independent woman, a direct threat/abomination to orthodox Christianity, which says that a woman is &quot;saved&quot; by bearing children and keeping silent in Church.  Thus, the industrial revolution was set back perhaps 1000 years (according to some historians).  Documents have been uncovered in the library's now-submerged ruins that contain fairly accurate estimations of the Earth's circumference, medicinal uses of various plants, and many other little tidbits that could have helped make the world a better place.  This is the legacy of orthodox, literalist Christianity. <p><img src=http://banton.20megsfree.com/Sigs/EcoFreak.jpg>

I have asked this question before, but your posting over the burning of the library in Alexandria underscores the question I would like to ask once again.<br>
<br>
What would stop Christians from doing such horrible actions today?<br>
<br>
My answer to the question is that democratic governments seperated from church or religion keep fanatical Christians at bay.<br>
<br>
Imagine if the United States government declared itself &quot;Christian&quot; and enforced orthodoxy! You bet there would be book burnings and killings. Many in the USA would turn a blind eye to it, too. Why? Only non-believers would be affected. You know, the freakish Atheists, Agnostics, Muslims, Buddhists. Without the separation of church and state Christians on the whole would have their 15 minutes and there would be much destruction. <p>Lurikeen Mali'Kyre<BR>

<br>
<br>
You guys have to remember that, as Lurikeen said, this occurred when there was no separation between church and state really.<br>
<br>
Whenever you have a Church Government, you run into problems, as the government then usually tries to legislate church law.<br>
<br>
The Christian Religion has always had severe problems whenever it was in a governmental role with ultimate power.<br>
<br>
Also recall that there were many &quot;factions&quot; of the Christian church that weren't really Christian at all that sprang up early on.  Paul and others spent much of their time trying to spread the gospel that has been accepted as Church doctrine and is written in the books of the bible, and they were in opposition to many of the so-called Christian groups out there at that time.<br>
<br>
Note also that in the bible (new testament), it clearly illustrates that there is a separation between government and the church and that it should remain so.  &quot;Give to Ceasar what is Ceasar's...&quot; is one example.<br>
<br>
However, I would just like to point out that one faction of violent Christians, does not represent the entire body of Christ, neither then nor now, and it would be a mistake to believe it did. Just as one person / faction does not represent whites or blacks or gay or Jews or Muslims or Buddhists....  The same principle applies here.  <br>
<br>
Btw, one example of a Church government is the Taliban.  They aren't Christian but they sure enforced horrid laws, all in the name of God.  <br>
<br>
Separation is a good thing, and actually is biblically correct.  And yes, lots of Christians disagree with me on this point but hey, can't please everyone.<br>
<br>
Btw, I find the idea of letting atheists have their 15 minutes the same as Christians.  The outcome is dependant upon the beliefs and character of the ppl, not necessarily what God they bow to, if any.  <br>

I agree with you on this Lukaria. Any form of government that lacks tolerance towards the people will commit attrocities. However, it is the &quot;holy governments&quot; that by far have the worse track record. Communist China is the only government that I am aware of that might possibly count as &quot;atheistic&quot; from a Western theological perspective. The former Soviet Union could not count, considering their tolerance of the Russian Orthodox Church and working with that Church to persecute &quot;heresies&quot; (e.g. Pentecostals).<br>
<br>
However, I could imagine those atheists who may want to see all of religion eradicated (Are there such atheists? I have never met any!) working to do so if they were able to gain exclusive power. <p>Lurikeen Mali'Kyre<BR>

They believe the book is perfect due to a bit of circular logic: God is perfect... the Bible is God's book... thus the Book is perfect.  You can make the same claims about the Koran, the Hindu Vedas, the book of Mormon, etc.  ALL of them purport to be God's book.  If the fundies had been born in India, they would defend the Hindu texts with the same alacrity!  For myself, I believe that there is wisdom in them, but it is hidden, as these books are all based on earlier, ancient mystery religons.  The fundies, if they got their way, would happily plunge humanity back into the horror of the Dark Ages, simply because they are too arrogant to look at the way anyone else thinks and too stupid to take the bible any other way than literally.<br>
<br>
One of the things I find ironic, given the Church's stance on drugs, is that the Mosaic &quot;manna from heaven&quot; is described as one would describe a mushroom, specifically amanita muscaria, a plant that had great significance in ancient mystery religon due to it's psychedelic/entheogenic effects.  If fact, some linguists translate &quot;manna&quot; directly as &quot;mushroom.&quot;  (lingustic anthropology is a passion of mine <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ) <p><img src=http://banton.20megsfree.com/Sigs/EcoFreak.jpg>
