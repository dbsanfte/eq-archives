Have a great story for ya on this fella.  I was sitting in the qeynos bank waiting for a guy I was buying a sword off of. I was sitting in the corner and in walks this warrior that is green to me.  He was wearing bronze and FP armor, and the name Binidin.  I have met him before with my lvl 9 druid, he was begging off of him too so we dueled becuase he offered me 25pp to do it.  After we were done he said since I lost that I dont get anything.  This changed him to KoS for me.<br>
<br>
So I am in the bank and he is begging up a storm.  Spamming my screen with inspects and just pissing me off all together.  He TOLD me to give him my bronze legs.  I told him he had FP and didn't need to have them.  Stuff like this goes on for a while then I lvl 45 ranger in the zone said he would give Binidin 200pp if he dualed him in the pit.  So Binidin goes over to the pit and I follow.  He just stands on the edge of the pit running in and out like a fool while the ranger tries to nuke him.  Finally I stood behind him so he couldn't get out and the ranger rooted his ass.  Then I procided to rape him thorughly.  My 18 warrior killed him in about 30sec and he hit me for a whole 5points of damage.  You would think he would learn from that leason.  Oh well, I got my revenge.  &lt;laughs evilly&gt;<br>

And Derek, I think Tanilae is talking about much more than just the general forum posts, and I must say I would have to agree in part.  Perhaps you should think posts out a bit more before making them. <p><img src="http://www.alundraadjani.com/otherstuff/eq/sig2.jpg">

I hail him back and he tells me, &quot;Can you go to the lizard city (Cabilis) and get an axe someone is holding for me?&quot;. I reply, &quot;Umm, no way, sorry dude, it's a VERY long run..&quot;. He tells me, &quot;COME ONNNNN MAN!! 80 other people have said no, this is a 45 damage axe we're talking about here!!&quot;.

I put him on ignore and figure he can stand around and try and talk to me for the rest of the night, but if I can't hear him, then who gives a damn.

The other n00bs says, &quot;Leave the lizard alone, he's cool...&quot; And I said, &quot;What's going on?&quot;. He tells me that this guy is talking bad about me. So I reply, &quot;Oh, I can't hear what he's saying, I put that moron on ignore like 10 mins ago.&quot; He then tried to KS my ogre gaurds, so I rooted it, and it spun around and killed him.

Generally not a nice guy.  Has a few char's that begin with Krono.  <br>
<br>
my problem with him.. I gated to my bind point *corner just outside neriak ent*  he was sitting on me.  Not a problem right?  Just politely ask the ogre to please move a little so I could be on my merry way?  Not in this case.  <br>
<br>
Asked once, no response of any kind.  No biggie, maybe he's afk.  <br>
<br>
Asked a 2nd time when I saw the AFK tag disappear.  Nothing.  <br>
<br>
Then he speaks.  Saying he has a bug that won't let him move.  um, alright.  I can accept that.  Tells me that *I* have to camp &amp; relog.  it should fix itself.  that's when I knew something wasn't right.  <br>
<br>
Someone else that was there mentioned that maybe he should relog, since he has the bug.  I also said the same thing.  <br>
<br>
Politely.  I say &quot;could you please at least try to camp, so that I may move?&quot;  &quot;um, I have to go afk again, sorry&quot;  <br>
<br>
Now, I was talking to my guildleader this entire time.  he made the suggestion that I warn Krono that if he doesn't move, that'll I'll petition because he's inhibiting my game play &amp; that's against the play nice rules.  I do so &amp; still nothing.  <br>
<br>
Just as I'm about to petition he moves.  I asked my guildleader why &amp; he says it's because he talked to Krono himself.  apparently Krono also threatened to petition my guild leader because he was asked to move.  <br>
<br>
at any rate, I'm not that fond of Krono &amp; he's ruined any chance I have of trusting anyone that may use &quot;Krono&quot; at the beginning of their char's name.  *sighs* I'll just make do I suppose.  *bows* my apologies now for I meant no ill will towards anyone.  I'm an evil race &amp; class.  That's how I play.  Also, I'm kind towards those who are kind to me.  As I'm sure that that's how it should be.<br>

I then say again No he says well I got 100pp more in the bank i said ok i will do for 100pp since u seem u want it so much. So we go to the bank from BlackBurrow and I get there and he says oh I only have 2 more pp. So I say no sorry I gotta go and he says no. Then he says can u give me some money so I can buy your FP BP..... He just goes on and on and on...... he is very anoying I have done this twice, Same situation and same thing happened.<br>

(since this seems to have turned into a Kronoshadow/binidin thread)  We had a member in our guild that was playing an Alternate in Nektulos.  Kronoshadow was following this alternate around KSing every kill.  He claimed that he was &quot;helping&quot;.  Once one of our level 40+ members showed up, he stopped.<br>
<br>
As I am KoS in Qeynos, it looks like I will never have the pleasure of meeting this fool.  /cheer optimus  Only sad part is he will probably never fall for the same trick again.  Though you should have ported him to Iceclad or Dreadlands. <p><CENTER>

Now being the nice person I am..I tell him that I couldn't help him that he needed to help himself and he just kept asking why..and why and why not..<br>
