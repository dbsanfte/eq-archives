It is our hope that the contents of this document will<br>benefit not only the players as intended, but you as well in order to make this<br>game the best it can be and stomp out the competition.<br><br>Wizards are writing this because as the focus turns toward balancing casters,<br>Wizards feel there are some issues with the Wizard class that deserve looking<br>into. For a period of time, Wizards were for the most part balanced and held a<br>well-respected position on the land of Norrath. As many things do, Norrath has<br>changed and Wizards feel that the Wizard class remained static while many others<br>changed. The Wizard community has solid reasons for stating this and wishes to<br>share those reasons with you today.<br><br>One overall point the Wizard community would like to point out is that through<br>the last two expansions, casters in general stayed relatively static in levels 1<br>through 50. While their melee counter parts received enormous boosts in both the<br>1 through 50 game and the 51 through 60 game, Wizards and other casters saw<br>their boosts at the high level game. So if a scale was to be used to represent<br>the change than imagine a balanced scale that represents levels 1 through 50.<br>Toss more weight in the melee side of the scale than on the caster side and soon<br>you have an unbalanced scale. The same can be said for the 51 through 60 game.<br>This document will go more into detail on this issue, but this is the core issue<br>and because of this concern comes other side effects.<br><br>Some previous notions about game balance may have to be thrown away in order for<br>balance to exist like it once did. It should be known that this document focuses<br>around the concerns of the Wizard community as best as it can. Whether the<br>issues described herein are flaws or by design, they are seen as concerns. If<br>they are by design the Wizard community requests that a review be done to make<br>sure the design is what is best for the game currently and in the future.<br><br>The problems and issues this document addresses are as follows:<br>1 –        The Past and Present<br>2 –        Wizards and their attractiveness to groups<br>3 –        Balance between the classes<br>4 –        Wizards in PvP<br>5 –        Specific spell issues/concerns<br>6 –        Area of Effect Spells<br>7 -        Caster Items<br><br><br>B - PROBLEMS AND ISSUES THE WIZARD CLASS FACES<br>1 -        The Past and Present<br><br>Rumors used to spread through the game like wildfire of Wizards being able to<br>command the most powerful spell in the game at level 49, called Ice Comet, which<br>did an insane amount of damage for that time period. It was something Wizards<br>looked towards as a goal, as well as other classes who looked forward to seeing<br>their Wizard friends obtaining this goal.<br><br>Wizards were invaluable on raids in battles for epic encounters such as Lord<br>Nagafen and Lady Vox. The massive damage of Ice Comet made Wizards an extremely<br>popular choice on such raids. Back then many Wizards wasted a lot of experience<br>(XP) as they sacrificed themselves in order to cause this quick damage.<br>Strategies have changed and today Warriors and other melee classes (often called<br>‘tanks’) can equip themselves with armor that protects them in ways that were<br>once thought unimaginable, equip weapons that allow them to do quick sustained<br>damage. The need for a Wizard’s quick magical damage attack is not what it once<br>was.<br><br>When Kunark was released there was a lot of hope in all classes for balance and<br>their concerns answered.<br><br>The Draught and Lure lines were the two new main Wizard abilities. While Ice<br>Comet was still considered the ‘big’ damage, the draughts were said to be faster<br>more efficient nukes. Which was true and they were spread out over ten levels,<br>where that each level requires nearly the same amount of time as 1 to 50 did,<br>yet the Draughts did not really increase much in power.<br><br>The Lure line became the cream of the crop in that it allowed Wizards to cause<br>quick damage on raids where other casters could not. While it was disturbing to<br>some that there was such a poor damage to mana to damage ratio, the low<br>resistibility of the spell line made it extremely valuable. When Velious was<br>released this changed the effectiveness of the Lure line. The upper level mobs<br>were no longer 32,000 hit point (HP) monsters or beats (MoBs), but 200,000+ hp<br>MoBs. While the Lure line added damage it no longer was seen as a necessity or<br>even an asset. Such as in Kunark’s release, Velious brought in more armor and<br>weapons for tanks to become even more powerful. Casters remained relatively<br>static compared to their melee counter parts.<br><br>Dragonsbane and Giantsbane were finally released after looking at the balance<br>scale. These spells cost two peridots per cast no less, a very high cost for<br>letting Wizards do what they once were able to do, made Wizards a valuable asset<br>in Velious raids again. With mana regeneration from about six different methods<br>finally allow Wizards to perform the same job they were once known for, causing<br>extreme amounts of damage. With Primal weapons tanks are able to once again<br>rival Wizards in fast damage, as well as absorb a lot of damage. While Primal<br>weapons can be used on any MoB, the Bane line of spells only works on certain<br>MoBs.<br><br>Recently all melee classes were given a massive upgrade, cutting the line very<br>short between melee and caster damage. Also, the resists were lifted on a good<br>deal of mobs in the game. This opened a good 95% of the MoBs for other casters<br>to do damage. What has this done to Wizards? Lures are quickly loosing their<br>usefulness on high-end encounters, where only in rare occasions are they used.<br>The low resists, while a very nice change, also shorted the line between other<br>casters and Wizards on raids.<br><br>But through all this, Wizards are maintaining their edge in raiding encounters.<br>While Wizards would like to have that same edge Ice Comet provided two years ago<br>there is one thing Wizards would like to see even more. And that is to be seen<br>as more than just a raiding class, but an attractive everyday Experience Grind<br>group class as well.<br><br><br>2 -        Wizards and their attractiveness to groups<br><br>The primary concern among Wizards is being attractive to what is typically<br>referred to as Experience Grind Group (many times used as ‘XP Grind Group’).<br>This is the group that hunts either outdoors, such as the Dreadlands; or inside<br>dungeons, such as Sebilis. Wizards feel they shine in many high level raiding<br>encounters, and they also feel they shine in soloing monsters. It is the<br>typical XP grinding group that Wizards would like to be a part of. Most Wizards<br>chose the Wizard class over the Magician class because they did not want to<br>solo.<br><br>Right now many non-playing Wizards in the game believe that Wizards do not carry<br>their own weight since Wizards are always trying to “keep up” with the pulling.<br>Sometimes this view is correct and other times it is flat out wrong.<br><br>Yet, the common issue many Wizards say is a problem is that they are having a<br>hard time keeping up with XP grind groups. There are four main reasons for this:<br>Downtime, Aggro, Damage, and Resists.<br><br>2.1        – Wizard Downtime<br><br>Wizards suffer a tremendous downtime. Many times a Wizard will feel compelled to<br>only do one Direct Damage spell (here after called DD) along with Bonds of Force<br>(here after called Snare) and maybe a stun spell. Now obviously tactics change<br>from zone to zone, but the fact that many Wizards conserve their mana for the<br>emergency purposes (i.e. full burn on over pulls or for Evacuation) leaves many<br>classes wondering if the Wizard is doing his/her fair share of the damage.<br><br>Wizards want their main spell line to be damage, with some utility spells as<br>well.<br><br>Wizards are hindered by the current design for downtime, and that it is having<br>an adverse effect on the game. Wizards relish the idea that the class is great<br>for helping in an emergency, but that should not be the focus of the class.<br><br>2.2        – Wizard Damage<br><br>When Wizards do a full burn on their mana, there is little concern about whether<br>they are doing enough damage or not. The problem emanates from that no Wizard,<br>nor the group, wants a full burn.<br><br>The important point to note here, is that a Wizard can keep up with other<br>classes in doing damage if they chain cast, but once they start doing this they<br>drastically reduce their effectiveness because after about three to four fights<br>the Wizard will be out of mana, which means the Wizard can provide no more<br>service to the group till the Wizard regains his/her mana. The downtime depends<br>on level of the Wizard, current group members (i.e. Enchanters, Bards, etc.),<br>and items in possession.<br><br>This goes hand in hand with the first issue, being Wizard downtime.<br><br>Another problem that Wizards face is that in many cases other classes have DD<br>spells that rival that of the Wizard class. Yes, those classes do not have as<br>good of a mana to damage ratio, casting time, or refresh delay timer but the<br>fact their DD spells come close and in some cases cause more damage than Wizards<br>sets a tone for some groups. Those classes can provide utility functions (such<br>as heal, buff, etc.) or call upon pets that will do a good job in both taking<br>damage and dealing damage.<br><br>Since these classes can provide other functions, the fact that their damage<br>dealing spells rival that of a Wizard’s, sometimes a Wizard will be overlooked<br>since they do not provide a convincing enough advantage over these other classes<br>in dealing magical damage. Many do not know the other advantages Wizard spells<br>have (mana ratio, spell refresh, etc.), and in some cases the advantages are<br>hardly negligible, such as 20 points of mana difference at higher levels.<br><br>2.3        – Aggro on DD Spells<br><br>Wizards know they can do their “fair share” but this requires multiple castings<br>of DD spells. Doing this makes the downtime even longer and also aggravates the<br>target into attacking the Wizard. Spells have the greatest taunting effect than<br>any other skill, and sometimes rightfully so as it makes the game more<br>challenging. There is a balancing factor missing, in that spells cause more<br>“aggro” than they should.<br><br>2.4        – Resists and how they affect Wizards<br><br>Before Wizards had an advantage over other classes in that Wizards had spells<br>that allowed them to cause damage to some Non Player Characters (NPC) that other<br>casters could not touch. With the recent change that advantage has become less<br>apparent. Wizards feel that change was one of the best changes that could happen<br>to casters.<br><br>But Wizards still face a problem in that in levels 1-50, resists can make the<br>Wizard feel like he/she is not contributing to the group at all. Add in the<br>downtime associated as well as the extra aggro that sometimes occurs from a<br>resist and soon you have a trend where Wizards do not look so group attractive<br>to people anymore.<br><br>2.5        – Possible Solutions<br><br>These are possible solutions that can be used to overcome the issues/problems<br>described above. More than one solution may be offered in some cases. The Wizard<br>class would like to make it clear that they do not expect for all these<br>solutions to be used, or maybe even none at all. The solutions are only there to<br>help with the creative thinking.<br><br>Since the player base does not have in depth knowledge of what is possible and<br>what is not possible with the current game engine, some of these solutions just<br>may not be possible. If they are not it might be wise to inform the Wizard<br>community so the same solution does not keep getting proposed time after time.<br>The Wizard community also lacks the knowledge of what ‘Shadows of Luclin’ will<br>bring besides a few snippets with no in depth details (i.e. Familiars).<br><br><br>2.5.1        – Wizard Downtime<br><br>One possible solution would be to lower the mana cost on most Wizard DD Spells,<br>starting from level 34 and up. The downside to this is that it makes single<br>soloing easier. As far as soloing is concerned, Wizards excel in soloing four<br>monsters at a time (called Quad Kiting). Now while this is very dangerous and<br>requires a good bit of skill, a Wizard soloing will most likely choose this<br>route over single soloing.<br><br>Another version of this would be to make the ‘Specialize’ skill more pronounced<br>so that a Wizard would actually be able to see when the Specialize skill kicked<br>in. This has the same downside the above solution does, but it throws a random<br>factor into the mix so that a Wizard cannot truly rely on it. Or possibly even<br>allow 50-75 extra points for Specialization past level 51.<br><br><br>2.5.2        – Wizard Damage<br><br>2.5.2.1        - Levels 51 –60<br><br>A major concern of Wizards was damage in groups. It was felt by a big majority<br>of Wizards that damage output was under par, and that the Draughts did not offer<br>a sufficient enough variety between them. So the main idea that came across the<br>table was to scale the Draughts and make them equal with a slight max damage<br>upgrade. The following was the main discussed ideas.<br><br>Draught of Fire (Lv 51)<br>Mana: 200<br>Damage: From 656(Lv 51) to 800(Lv 60)<br>Ratio: From 3.28(51) to 4.0(60)<br><br>Voltaic Draught (Lv 54)<br>Mana: 200<br>Damage: From 704(Lv 54) to 800(Lv 60)<br>Ratio: From 3.52(54) to 4.0(60)<br><br>Draught of Jiva (Lv 55)<br>Mana: 200<br>Damage: From 720(Lv 55) to 800(Lv 60)<br>Ratio: From 3.6(55) to 4.0(60)<br><br>Draught of Ice (Lv 57)<br>Mana: 200<br>Damage: From 752(Lv 57) to 800(Lv 60)<br>Ratio: From 3.76(57) to 4.0(60)<br><br>Ice Spear of Solist<br>Casting Time: Reduce to 3.5<br><br>Sunstrike<br>Mana: 425<br>Damage: 1750 (Lv 60)<br>Ratio: 4.11<br><br>These alterations would give all Wizards a slight increase in damage post 50. <br>The purpose of this was to give Wizards more variety at each level. This way<br>Wizards can choose to use another Draught without having to worry about the<br>efficiency at higher levels. The increase in the mana to damage ratio puts<br>Wizard max damage along the lines of Ice Spear of Solist, which is not a huge<br>upgrade when long-term damage of some other casters and melees in an XP grind<br>situation is taken into consideration.<br><br>The concern of ‘solo ability’ comes to mind. Should point out, this would not<br>cause a huge upgrade in the damage a Wizard can do, the highest ratio of 4.0 at<br>level 60 is only increased by a total of 0.31 mana to damage ratio. When<br>looking at solo ability, we have to consider quad kiting. A 4.0 mana to damage<br>ratio does not compare to the maximum of 10.46 with Pillar of Flame at level 60.<br>A discussion talked about this and it would not make the Wizard class a better<br>solo class. And with the concern of old world farming, the point was brought up<br>that Necromancers, Magicians, and other such classes would still be better at<br>farming then Wizards and it would not unbalance that aspect of the game.<br><br>The reduction of Ice Spear of Solist casting time –<br>Since the ratio would be maintained at 4.0 the spell would not increase the<br>output damage of the Wizard. But the reduction in casting time from 4.0 to 3.5<br>would mean a faster bang. The recast delay would still remain in place, but if<br>the Wizard felt the need to do a lot of damage fast, this would be the spell to<br>use over the Draught Line or Sunstrike.<br><br>The increase of damage in Sunstrike –<br>The increase in Sunstrike is only to provide that top end spell of the Wizard<br>class, the spell everyone looks forward too such as Ice Comet at level 49. Its<br>long casting time would still be the downside for the higher damage.<br><br>Overall, what does this do? The lowered mana, accompanied by the slight<br>increase in damage of the Draught line would allow the Wizard to provide more<br>damage in a group situation over a long-term session. The damage does still not<br>reach up to Bane ability for the large high-end monsters, which still lets the<br>Bane spells retain their great usefulness. Wizards are a pure damage based<br>class, with very little defense and group utility compared to other classes, so<br>they should be compensated in what they are good at.<br><br>A large majority of the Wizards, plus from the feedback from Graffe’s board,<br>show support for this upgrade and feel it would make Wizards a better class than<br>it currently is in a group situation.<br><br><br>2.5.2.2        - Levels 1 - 50<br><br>A lot of ideas came up on this discussion, but after lots of discussion, the<br>best way to accomplish this would be to give about a 10% increase in damage to<br>Wizard DD spells for levels 29, 34, 39, and 44 where Wizard DD spells are<br>rivaled by other classes and where grouping to form relationships becomes even<br>more pronounced. The casting time and mana cost remain the same in this<br>proposal. The important part about this upgrade is that it would put Wizards<br>above the rest when it comes to magical damage where in some cases Wizard DD<br>spells do less damage than others or just slightly more than others.<br><br>Wizards are satisfied with Ice Comet, but one suggestion was to make Ice Comet<br>scale up in damage past level 50.<br><br><br>There were also two smaller spell upgrades that Wizards felt should be looked<br>into.<br><br>Snare Spell (L12, L16, or L20)<br>Effect: Similar to Snare/Bonds/Atol’s<br>Target: Single &lt;== this is the big point<br>Mana: ~20-30<br>Duration: Around 5-8 minutes perhaps.<br>Description: Wizards want a single target Snare spell. Wizards are fine at a<br>higher spell cost then Druids/Rangers. Such classes do get a form of root,<br>while Wizards only have an Area of Effect (AoE) Snare. In groups this costs a<br>huge amount of mana to snare mobs, so Wizards agreed that a single target snare<br>would be beneficial to both the group and to the Wizard class.<br><br>Low Level Lure Spell (L20 or L24)<br>Effect: Similar to Enticement-type<br>Target: Single<br>Descriptions: Wizards at lower levels have stated time and time again they<br>cannot hit mobs with a high Magic Resistance (MR) or mobs that are deep reds<br>because of the level cap. A similar lure spell at such a level would give<br>Wizards the ability to do damage to such mobs, while following the same aspect<br>of higher mana cost for the damage. This would of type Ice since there is an<br>Enticement of Flame spell at level 44.<br><br><br>3 -        Balance between the casters and melees<br><br>When discussions took place on this issue, one important point was lost in the<br>discussion. It was said that a Wizard upgrade would be difficult because it<br>would have to be an upgrade strong enough for Velious but not so strong that it<br>would be overpowered in Antonica. While that is true and the Wizard community<br>whole-heartedly agrees with that theory, it is also true that it just cannot be<br>done without doing proper care to keeping the balance between the classes. While<br>casters were kept in balance with Antonica, melees were not and received weapons<br>that were not only overpowered for the monsters of Antonica but for class<br>balance as well.<br><br>It should be noted that this argument does not take into consideration what<br>players calling “twinking” (giving lower level characters higher level gear),<br>yet merely weapons that are obtainable at a decent level range.<br><br>While melee damage capacity, defense capacity, and life sustaining capacity (HP,<br>resists, HP regen, etc.) grew at a tremendous rate casters such as Wizards<br>remained static. There are no items or spells that Wizards received for levels<br>1-50 that raised his/her capacity to anything noticeable. Harvest being closest<br>to this is still underpowered for all intents in purposes.<br><br>Wizards rely solely on their spells for weapons, so while there are new fancy<br>weapons with new and improved graphics and even fancier damage/delay ratios for<br>the melees; Wizard spells remained the same along with other casters. Because of<br>this it throws out the balance and now tank heavy groups are becoming the<br>preferred. Melee classes do nearly the same amount of damage and in some cases<br>more than a Wizard does in the same period of time levels 1 through 48. And with<br>new armor that has higher AC and higher HP the tanks are able to take more<br>damage, so in effect they can keep going while the Wizard has to sit and<br>meditate. Many times there is less downtime associated with a tank heavy group<br>than there once was pre-Kunark. In many cases a Wizard is only seen as a burden<br>to normal XP grinding groups. While many groups do not mind having a Wizard in<br>the group, there really is no compelling reason to have a Wizard other than to<br>“fill a spot”.<br><br>Wizard’s niche for a long time was the ability to burn down their opponent’s HP<br>at a quick rate. With the introduction of many weapons that have damage/delay<br>ratios even casters drool at, tanks are able to rival a Wizard’s capability of<br>laying down fast damage. In levels one through forty-eight, many times haste<br>items are not needed, and the weapons to achieve this are affordable for the<br>appropriate level range. Post level fifty it becomes harder but not impossible.<br><br><br>3.1        Possible solutions to Caster and Melee imbalance<br><br>Possible solutions were listed above in point 2.5 and subsequent sub-headings as<br>well as in 6.4 below.<br><br><br>4 –        Wizards in PvP<br><br>Currently Wizards in Player Vs Player (PvP) servers are finding it difficult to<br>stay alive as now with new resist gear, high HP gear, high AC gear, and HP<br>regenerating gear in the game for melees to take advantage it almost makes them<br>nearly untouchable. The only spells that land are Lure based and since caster<br>spells only do 75% of their maximum potential, it becomes nearly impossible to<br>survive an attack.<br><br><br>4.1        Possible Solutions for Wizards in PvP<br><br>Allow casters to get their maximum damage of spells. The new gear (stated above)<br>that is available provides more than enough balancing for this suggestion.<br><br>Specific to Wizards, is to give the Staff of Temperate Flux more pronounced<br>lowering of elemental (Fire and Ice) resists.<br><br><br>5 –        Specific spell issues/concerns<br><br>Bind Sight and Shifting Sight -<br>It is unclear if these spells were changed on purpose or accidentally, but the<br>current design for these spells is of little use to the Wizard class now.<br><br>Before these spells allowed the Wizard to cast the spell on a MoB that was not<br>in line of sight, but that is not the case anymore.

It is<br>known that Wizard AoE spells, post 50, are the very best in the game, with<br>awesome mana to damage ratio’s and great potential.<br><br>There are two types of fighting of fighting in EverQuest currently. One is to<br>handle one MoB at a time while the Enchanter uses crowd control abilities<br>through use of skills, or casters perform a lower version (parking MoBs with<br>Root), while the tanks melee the critter away. Many have started dubbing this<br>tactic The Holy Trinity where it is the Melee classes, Cleric, and Enchanter<br>that make the best group.<br><br>Wizards have formed a second variety of fighting that is nowhere near the<br>popularity of the first type. And that is to have multiple Wizards, a couple<br>enchanters, and a puller (sometimes a Bard) to pull in 20 MoBs or more and let<br>the AoE spells do the rest. One of the problems associated this technique is<br>that many times an AoE group will get in trouble if reported to a GM for<br>monopolizing the spawns. Also, many have grown accustomed to fighting only MoB<br>at a time.<br><br>Wizards would like to see a third tactic become popular and use AoEs like<br>Wizards believe they were meant to, and that is for a group consisting of a<br>variety of classes taking on multiple MoBs while the Wizard uses AoE spells to<br>shorten the fight.<br><br>Currently there are 3 main types of Area of Effect spells: Caster Based, Target<br>Based, and Rain spells.<br><br><br>6.1        - Player Based (PBAoE)<br><br>The caster based line hits a number/all targets that are around the caster.<br>These PBAoE spells are what is used in AoE groups (described above).<br><br>These types of spells are not quite so user friendly in a normal ‘XP grind’<br>group. Without knowing the spells inside and out and taking advantage of certain<br>pathing issues in some zones, using these spells can cause havoc in a group<br>where all the MoBs will go attack the Wizard.<br><br><br>6.2        - Target Based (Pillar and Al’Kabor)<br><br>The target-based line hits a number of targets around the targeted mob.<br><br>This spell line is has about the same effect as the Player Based AoE spells in<br>groups. It is very hard to find a well-placed cast that will not cause general<br>chaos and or death.<br><br>There is two lines along this line, Pillar and Al’Kabor. The Pillar line is<br>considered very efficient and effective when used. The Al’Kabor line on the<br>other hand is generally considered a non-useful line because of the high mana<br>cost and low damage. In many cases the ratio is not even 1:1, and the side<br>benefits such as a knock back to disrupt casters is not worth the mana cost.<br>Wizards have been told the reason of the extremely poor efficiency is because of<br>the knock back effects, extra target, and the increased effect range of the<br>spell. This spell line is usually either pushed to the back of the spell book or<br>some players just do not even collect the spells.<br><br><br>6.3        - Rain Based<br><br>The Rain based line of spells causes damage to rain down upon the enemy for a<br>maximum of 4 hits.<br><br>This line of spell is great against 1 target for it’s great mana efficiency for<br>levels 51-60 (i.e. the Tears line). But the problem is that the resistibility is<br>very high. The number of targets it can hit is not that great to be considered a<br>true AoE spell. The AoE effect could almost be considered an annoyance with the<br>current design of the spell and game.<br><br><br>6.4        - Possible Solutions to AoE Spells<br><br>Areas of Effect spells from a Wizard’s point of view are extremely efficient but<br>in some cases not practical. While that is an aspect that balances the spell<br>line, it also hinders it from being considered an attractive XP grind group<br>ability.<br><br>Possible solutions for making this line more attractive to groups would be:<br><br>Lower the Aggro associated with these spells. With lowered aggro, the use for<br>AoE’s could be greatly increased on everyday groups as well as on raids. While<br>multiple tanks melee multiple mobs close together, Wizards could use these<br>spells effectively without being beaten to a pulp and causing more harm than<br>good to the group.<br><br>Alter Rain spells to be more effective. Resistances is a high concern of this<br>line because if used on a single target where it is more efficient many times at<br>least one wave of the three is resisted thus lowering damage/mana ratio below<br>that of DDs. If used as an AoE spell, the agro<br><br>Look over the Al’Kabor line for a way to make it more useful to Wizards. While<br>the current design has it’s advantages in a small sense, the poor efficiency of<br>these spells prevents Wizards from using them.<br><br><br>7 –        Caster Items<br><br>Melee versus Caster drops on itemized Boss Encounters:<br><br>Currently on itemized boss encounters such as Cazic-Thule, Vulak`Aerr, and King<br>Tormax the ratio of melee drops to casters drops is overwhelmingly in favor of<br>melees. Cazic-Thule is notorious for this; he loads normally 5 or more melee<br>loots (Choker, Cloak, Pauldrons) before he will ever drop one single caster<br>piece. It has been noted time and time again how rarely Cazic-Thule drops caster<br>loot. Every server has seen a large influx of melee loot from him, but caster<br>loot is almost non-existent, especially the Brain. Vulak`Aerr is less partial to<br>melee-only drops, but still drops items that mostly benefit the melee classes,<br>and therefore are rewarded to them ahead of casters.<br><br>Suggestions<br><br>Some suggestions would be for every piece of loot Cazic-Thule drops, give a 40%<br>chance for a melee item and a 60% chance for a caster item. If he loads three<br>loot items, each of the three slots has a 40% melee and 60% caster chance for<br>what type of loot will drop. This is mainly to ensure that caster items are<br>slightly more likely to drop so that the total melee/caster loot drops to date<br>will be more balanced. If this is not acceptable, simply leave it at 50/50. Give<br>the Brain, Eye, and Robe each a 33% chance of dropping if caster loot is loaded.<br>If Cazic-Thule rolls to drop two caster items, each of the two slots will have a<br>33% chance for an eye, 33% chance for a robe, and 33% chance for a brain. Give<br>Vulak`Aerr a 50/50 chance for every loot slot for a caster item as well, the<br>nicer all/all items included.<br><br>There needs to be more caster-specific items added to the loot tables of the<br>boss encounters, such as the Solist’s Earring from Vulak`Aerr. Many of the items<br>that would greatly benefit casters as Akkirus’ Mask of Warfare will never be<br>awarded to casters because they have the all/all tag. It would be nice to load<br>identical loot to some of the current items, but with class restrictions. This<br>would help alleviate the caster vs. melee loot problems that have come around<br>since the release of Velious. There should also be an effort to create new<br>caster specific loot to be added into the loots tables.<br><br>This loot should help the caster with something more than just INT/WIS/CHA and<br>Mana/HP, by having unique effects and mana regeneration components greater than<br>2 points per tick. The items should also contain a very nice amount of HP and<br>Mana, possibly by raising the soft-cap of 100mana and/or HP on an item.<br><br><br>C - CONCLUSION<br>The authors of this document and the Wizards that support it once again would<br>like to like it perfectly clear that the possible solutions suggested in this<br>document are merely to help with the creative process for when casters get their<br>upgrade, like the melees got their upgrade a couple patches ago. It should also<br>be clear that the Wizard class is not expecting, suggesting, or even<br>recommending that all of these possible solutions be put in place. If there is a<br>possible solution that looks promising the authors encourage the readers to<br>strike up a private discussion with them and maybe even one or two other Wizards<br>that know the class inside out as well as the game.<br><br>It is our hope this document provided some useful information and came across<br>with that purpose. The authors have nothing but respect for the Wizard class and<br>the game itself. The authors know fully well what potential the Wizard class has<br>to offer, but would like to see the class more attractive to an Experience Grind<br>Group than it currently is.<br><br>Respectively,<br>Concerned Wizards of Norrath<br><br><br>AUTHORS<br>Eelyen Dalamar<br>Sorcerer of the 60th Flame of Ro<br>Avatars of Discord<br>Rodcet Nife<br><br>Shenlung Tianzhu<br>Reign of Heroes<br>Brell<br><br>Samadhi – Blood of the Spider<br>Level 60 Wizard<br>The Rathe<br><br>Rombus Mindspire<br>Sorcerer of Povar, Triton<br>www.graffe.com | rombus@graffe.com<br> <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/usondornovastorm.showPublicProfile?language=EN>SondorNovastorm</A> at: 11/5/01 12:08:44 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uaustriana.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Austriana</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Cyber Pimp</span><br> <font color=#000033>(11/4/01 3:52:50 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumwizard.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=203.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://austriana.homestead.com/files/itschy.gif http://austriana.homestead.com/files/itschy.gif></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Wizard Class Balance *READ*</span><hr size=1> Wow, that's an awesome read.

Like some others have stated, the fixes that are outlined seem to be pulled right out of thin air.  Evidence is the key.  Make a statemen, then back it with facts.<br><br>Anyway, I can't really complain, as I did not attend the irc meeting.  I hope that positive fixes for our class are implemented in future patches and expansions.<br><br>Chodeller<br>59 Wizard<br>Proud member of Fallen Legacy <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/umascen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mascen</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_lightning.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Cyber Pimp</span><br> <font color=#000033>(11/8/01 2:14:39 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumwizard.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=203.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Wizard Class Balance *READ*</span><hr size=1> I actually like wizards as they are.

Wizard is sitting on his ass medding cause there no f00king way a wizzard is gonna nuke as soon as mob is pulled an get aggro.<br><br>Now here is the thing, for the entire first minute of the fight the wizard is just sitting down while the tanks are working the mob, when mob hits 60% hp wizard stands and starts to Nuke.  Wizard will do approx 40% ofthe mobs hp in damage, the 3 tanks did a combined total of 60%, or 20% each.<br><br>Result?  wizard kicked ass, but because he is &quot;perceived&quot; to have done nothing and thereby contribut NO value we get a bum rap.<br><br>To be fair, every 10 mobs we need to sit out and med cause our mana is Finite.  But we are very well balanced in an exp grp.<br><br>(2) Uber Mob encounters<br><br>Kunark Uber Mobs:  Dont have a lot of casters?  Your screwed unless your tanks are &quot;extremely&quot; well equipped.  From Trakanon Raids i have led and participated in, I would get off anywhere between 5 and 10 Lure of Ice spells, yes thats from 4k to 8k in damage to a fight.  When 20+ peeps are beating on a Mob 1 PC having the capability to cause 13% - 25% of mobs HP damage is damn nice.<br><br>Same is true for all other Kunark Mobs.  One Notable exception is Venril Sathire, he can be done with tank classes only if needed.<br><br>As for VP, dont even bother going unless ye have LOTS of casters that can Nuke down a Mob Fast.<br><br>Veliouse Mobs:  Here is where it gets different, as is well known thesemobs have HUGE amounts of HP, and quite frankly untill ye get your Bane line of spells your not going to be very usefull in a Raid.  Using CT as an example I could usually get anywhere between 12-14k in damage on him, most Rogues and Rangers can do better in a CT fight (True Shot is just fucking awsome heh).  Dain is the same story.  But on the OTHER mobs that can be affected by Banes, or Sunstrike we just rule.  The Typical Vulak Fight I do 50k Damage, thats WAY more than any other class, same is true for other mobs (just not as high damage due to lower hp of those mobs).<br><br>(3) Wizard Gear<br><br>The one thing I notice is that wizards spend alot of effort trying to get AC/HP gear.  For the life of me i dont understand that.  We are a MANA class only. HP and AC is Useless to us, we dont need it.  Focus on getting your int to 255 and getting as many +mana Items as you can.  More Mana = More Nukes, More Int = Higher chance your specialisation will kick in reducing Cost of Nuke and fewer fizzles.<br><br>Work on the concussion spell, its frigging invaluable to us in case of overburn.<br><br>Just my thoughts as the Oldest wizard on this server =)<br><br> <p>Karsys<br>Sorceror of Lanys</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uxyz1001.showPublicProfile?language=EN>xyz1001</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>n00b!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(11/13/01 2:02:59 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumwizard.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=203.topic&index=20>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Wizard Class Balance *READ*</span><hr size=1> I commend the efforts of the people that wrote this white paper. I for one am not happy with a wizard’s ability to find a group. They should rename the wizard class to outcast, as it more fittingly describes a wizard’s ability to find groups. I have been in OT, DL, etc… many times seeing clerics, enchanters and warriors call out for a group only once. Meanwhile, the outcast class gets to spend their next hour of game time trying to piece a pick-up group together, or solo. Too often it turns into soloing. I read somewhere once that wizards are the best class for soloing, not because we want to be, but rather because we are forced to.<br><br>My $.02<br><br>Uzzelen<br>High Guardians<br>49th Wizard<br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/umascen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mascen</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_lightning.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Cyber Pimp</span><br> <font color=#000033>(11/13/01 9:31:23 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumwizard.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=203.topic&index=21>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Wizard Class Balance *READ*</span><hr size=1> I agree with Karsys that mana should be the most important thing for wizards.
