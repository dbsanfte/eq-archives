<br>
The only thing I really see myself needing to upgrade is my ram, because that's what's causing those problems.<br>
<br>
Just fyi, I have a p2 450mhz(normally clocks at 433), 96mb ram, riva tnt2 32mb, win98, running on a regular modem with AOL, and I have all the char graphics turned on and everything.  Moving around old zones is fine and just as smooth as before, except sometimes my screen will lock up for about 30 seconds then return to normal.  The only Real problems I've had is I somehow had a corrupted shadow haven file, and when I fuck with my char's graphics(guising/fixing my face to what it should be after I guise) I Rarely get DC'd shortly after.<br>
<br>
Sad thing is, I'm too poor to even buy ram atm hehe. after I find out how much I need I might be able to upgrade it in a few weeks though.<br>
<br>
Tuan, send me 300 bucks so I can upgrade all the shit I need to! <p><center><img src=" http://home.btconnect.com/Lindzc/mage.gif"><i><b><font size="3" face="Ariel Narrow"><font color="red"><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=8859>Ramierez D`Elerian Draegonis</a></i></b></font></font><img src=" http://home.btconnect.com/Lindzc/mage.gif"><i><b><font size="2" face="Ariel Narrow"><font color="blue"><br>A Wizard's soul is forged in the crucible of magic.~~Antimodes of the White Robes.</i></b></font></font></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uautvincere.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Autvincere</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 66<br> <font color=#E9D756>(12/6/01 5:25:47 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2741.topic&index=38>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Performance&gt;Beauty</span><hr size=1> this is what i typed in a different thread that answers someones question or you can skip down to the ***<br>

I have 2 machines one is a pII300 with a ati rage fury 32mb 96mb of ram. I have more RAM just never put it in. <br>
This machine works, I did not install SoL and it was the first of my 2 machines to work. <br>
<br>
Here is the problem.<br>
<br>
This machine is SoL enabled.<br>
My main machine is a athlon 1.4 (266mhz FSB) 512mb DDRAM PC2100. It had a GeForce 2 64mb PRO. I couldnt stay in the game for more then 20 seconds. I switched in a GeForce 2 64mb Platinum. I mean this machine is fast. Its stable, well if you count turning off all sound because when there is sound turned on and I get into a fight then I crash to desktop. The video drivers were released 12/03/2001. It has direct X 8.1. The machine is running a fully patched win98se. I have a cable modem with no one else sucking up bandwith. <br>
<br>
Yet its still laggy. Yet its still laggy. Yet its still laggy. Yet its still laggy. Yet its still laggy. Yet its still laggy. Yet its still laggy. Yet its still laggy. Yet its still laggy. Yet its still laggy. <br>
<br>
And that is in zones like NFP WFP EC NO RO OASIS SO RO In Swamp Upper Guk Lower Guk. Yes you can guess where I went to test it.<br>
<br>
The day before SoL came out, while the patching was happening actually. I put a fresh hard drive in and all it has is drivers EQ and SoL. No other software at all.<br>
<br>
I am going to put my old hard drives in and not install SoL and see what that does. <br>
<br>
<br>
My final word is this &quot;I have the Hardware. I have the know how. The game is still laggy. Did VI test the game on a multiprocessor supercomputer with a 1gb graphic station video card?&quot; <br>

OK now to this thread<br>
<br>
From a business standpoint SoL is a mistake the way it was put into effect.  I agree that making this expansion was a huge undertaking.  But making it so you shave off a real % of your customer base that pays you money to try and compete with a new title was not smart.  I see lots of people going over to DAOC(Which I dont play but my girlfriend does) simply because they cant play EQ.  The difference in performance between my system and the fastest available is not very much.  I would estimate 15% at most.  Although it is probably 300% faster then what people were using until the patch.  New software always drives the hardware market. <br>
<br>
BUT VI IS NOT MICROSOFT (the old saying what Intel giveth Microsoft taketh away)<br>
<br>
I bet this expansion sucks some people back from other games, gets some new people, and pisses away a bunch of loyal customers.  <br>
<br>
If I was a business owner I would want to keep the loyal customers, those are the Everfreaks that pay their $10 a month for a long time.  Hell my girlfriend liked UO so much she is just now getting ready to close her account. <br>
<br>
From a business standpoint I think it was silly to make it such that people not buying the expansion or people not able to use it are getting sent away.<br>
<br>
If  I ran VI I would want to keep every dedicated person I could.<br>
<br>
<br>
Just my opinions, but someone wanted to know if anyone with a higher end system had troubles.  And for those of you that blame me using windows 98se I am going to put a Windows 2000 install and see how that works.  <br>

384MB Ram <br>
Win98<br>
Voodoo5 5500 AGP<br>
56k dialup /shudders<br>
<br>
384MB ram only supports 20 character models, so I have 20 loaded, and my system runs pretty well in Luclin. Zone times are sub par, even in the old world, but I expected it. Never had one longer than about 3 minutes actually. Haven't crashed either. Graphics bog down in Shar Vahl...damn if that wasn't expected either<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
At this point in time I'm seeing two options open to me. 1, upgrade to 512 RAM which I'm still not sure '98 will utilize. (Heard it won't access more than 384, heard 512 is the max, would love to know the truth). Or I upgrade to Win2k/XP. <br>
I'm prepared to one, or even both, but no way I'd be able to swing it till after Christmas. I guess I'm just lucky that the game runs adequately as is.<br>

$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$<br>
THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY, DECEMBER 5, 2001 <br>
Luclin is live, but not without issues.<br>
<br>
With what seems to be a re-occurring trend in massively multiplayer games these days the release was plagued with problems, many of which are still in game this morning.<br>
<br>
So lets see what players got for their dollar.<br>
<br>
The Good<br>
<br>
Amazing new graphics.<br>
 <br>
I must say these graphics really do rock.  Even with the massive hard drive space required to fit it all (1.5 gig) this is a really nice improvement to the games graphical appeal.  It does seem second time around that the characters have been able to be portrayed a little bit closer to the way the developers had envisioned them.<br>
  <br>
Horses<br>
  <br>
Whilst the more expensive horses are truly verging on being over-priced at 100k, the horses are a fun new element to gameplay.<br>
  <br>
Very nice new zones<br>
 <br>
The new town zones are great!  They are large and very realistic.  The implementation of the nexus and travel to and from the old world is unique and looks great visually also.<br>
  <br>
Alternate Advancement<br>
 <br>
Obviously one of the best things of the expansion.  This offers a great new variety to players at high levels. <br>
The Bad<br>
<br>
The patching of the files needed after purchasing was handled extremely poorly, even non-Luclin customers suffered hard through poor planning of the 100,000+ people who would want to get back online after more than 24 hours without playing (servers were taken down at noon the day before release).  Offering a zip to download off their webservers, or simply having more patch servers available would have helped tremendously.    <br>
  <br>
The engine was obviously not tested sufficiently. <br>
Zoning times for players has been reported as horrendous with the new textures enabled.  Even people with very powerful machines are taking up to 3 minutes to zone (although gameplay is fine once zoned).   <br>
A large number of items are not displaying correctly when equipped. <br>
Facial settings are not staying correctly <br>
Model and Texture displays are bugged in a number of situations (stand up and keep looking like you are sitting, etc) <br>
The change which has resulted in all Windows 95 users being unable to play everquest in any form without upgrading their operating system has left many people stranded.  Even though the box does say Windows 98 or higher is required, Sony should have communicated this to people at least a week or two before release so that players could prepare.<br>
  <br>
The need to upgrade computers as a pre-requisite to using the expansion was always going to be an issue.  This has become more significant since the required implementation of DirectX 8.1 which caused a number of problems for people playing on graphics boards more than 18 months old.  Sony did give players quite a bit of warning regarding this however before the launch.  Hopefully they will work with players who cannot play due to hardware to make their engine more compatible. <br>
Early Conclusions<br>
<br>
It is still early to be doing a full review of the expansion.  What we do know is that the game will be better for it. The question is how long will it take?  How many customers will not be willing to upgrade their computers to play?  How do customers feel about being told they cannot play unless they upgrade?  Once it is completed and the kinks are ironed out though, Shadows of Luclin will definitely put EverQuest in a position visually, and gameplay wise to last for quite a while to come<br>

  It's called a damn budget, people.  If you can't afford the 30 bux for more ram, then maybe you should eat McDonald's less during your lunch breaks.  Stop smoking, drink less.  Buy less red meat.  Stop buying soda.  Don't eat Doritos.  Generic coffee is almost as good, if not better.<br>
<br>
  When you pack your kid's lunch, don't put fruit roll ups in there.  Prepackaged crap food in individually wrapped plastic bags that come in boxes of 4 are not your friend.  Your kids do not need clothing from The Gap.  You don't need an SUV to get to work.<br>
<br>
  People flailing their arms calling computer geeks unemployed etc etc blah blah are probably the same ones who bought movie tickets for Tombraider... hell, they probably didn't even go to a matinee.  Stop porking your wife and cut back on the birth control.  If you can't handle the lack of sex, just find a different hole.<br>
<br>
  We all have certain pleasures in our lives we indulge ourselves in.  Those pleasures cost money.  Cars break and need fixed, computers get old and need tweaked, wives get fat and ugly, kids outgrow their clothes.  Yer supposed to budget for this crap, not act all suprised when it happens.<br>

I'm sure a PC that WAS sufficient, should now be the top of everyone's priority list when Verant says they have new specs for their game.  Everyone should just neglect all other bills/expenses and go drop a grand on a new system. <p><center>

Ok seriously, as long as this is a performance rant, here goes:<br>
Athlon 1 Ghz<br>
Win 98 SE<br>
256 mB Ram<br>
gForce 2 PRO<br>
56k dialup (yuck)<br>
<br>
Conclusion: unplayable. Video choppyness makes death a certainty in any underground zone where you cant do 3 or 4 spins to get all the textures to preload. LGuk, turn a corner = death. Zonetime is > 5 minutes normally, well over that into a crowded zone. The trip from Guk to East Commons took about 40 minutes realtime. Yuck yuck yuck.<br>
<br>
This PC should run this program just fine. I blame the application. It seems I may be right, as there are several framerate fixes in the patches that I do not have yet. More memory is INC as well. We'll see.<br>

However, without installing SoL performance degraded for me in the old zones. Changing the requirements for running a game (without Luclin) a long time after release is bad, mmm'kay?<br>
<br>
I can't say that I'm entirely sure what does it, but I wouldn't be surprised if their new dx8 code is at least partly to blame. Considering that testing brought up loads of trouble with it, mere days before the patch, I don't think it was quite ready. :-P<br>

This game is here to stay for a while and they simply can't afford to constantly keep upgrading the game engine to keep up with technology and compete with 'newer' graphic engines in other games.  This game engine is SUPPOSED to be way to powerful for all but the most top end machines (at least when running in all it's new glory ie all models turned on and at a decent resolution 1024x768 minimum).  That way when you have your new P6 4Gig machine with 6Gig of RAM 2 years from now you can crank all the settings on high and still say &quot;hey, this game looks cool&quot;.  It looks like the only way they could do this is to force the lowest end systems to upgrade a little for the minimum requirements.  They may be forcing out a small amount of their user base now but in the long run it probably (hopefully) will be a good change. <p>Athao Zarr <BR>

If this is the case, well then sure I agree, I thought people were saying that with Luclin installed and everything turned down it was to slow.<br>
<br>
Just confused because on my machine I tried EQ w/o Luclin installed and I had much faster zoning time/fps.  Then I installed luclin and turned on everything and the zoning was a little longer but everything was still as smooth as normal. <p>Tuan {Cupcakes} the Vicar</p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <br><font color=#E9D756>- </font><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/bemarr>Erollisi Marr, The Queen of Love</a><font color=#E9D756> - </font><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes>Rants and Flames</a> <font color=#E9D756> - </font> <br>
