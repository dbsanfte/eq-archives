In this act, he is of a similar mentality to a terrorist. Yes, that is a strong sentance, and while he may not be in the violent realm, he is still causing anger intentionally for his own pleasure or need for attention.<br>

If what he had posted was an opinion it would have a place here. It wasn't even a Rant or a Flame.

Whether it is true, I don't know, but this is the theory.  As for Mors, go to hell and I hope Satan treats you like his bitch; you aren't worth any more tactful response than that.  <br>
<br>
Umbrae - No more than 1 week ago President Bush warned Afghanistan outright that IF Bin Laden was responsible for an attack on the country we would not only hold him responsible, but we would hold ALL OF AFGHANISTAN responsible because they were harboring him.  This warning was in response to the fact that they would not turn over Bin Laden after he VERY PUBLICLY said that <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> &quot;American Blood will be spilled&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.  We warned them, lets back up that warning if it IS Bin Laden.  I'm not one for making a threat and not backing it up.  So in answer to your question, hell yes it makes sense, we gave them the warning, screw them if they had something to do with it.  <br>
<br>
Mors/Ibriar - NATO has declared that if this was an attack by members outside the U.S. then it was not only an <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> ACT OF WAR</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> against the U.S., but also against all of NATO.  In case you're brain can't comprehend this, that means that the entire world will unite in completely nuking these dumb fucks back into the Stone Age.  Make no mistake, there WILL be retaliation, and IT IS ALREADY WAR.  These cowardly bastards declared it, and we WILL end it.  <br>
<br>
Lastly, if you think in any way that OUR GOVERNMENT was involved in this terrorist attack, then you have a lower IQ than the jackasses who flew those planes into the buildings and killed tens of thousands of innocent people, whose only crime was showing up for work on time, believing that it would get them into Heaven.  I honestly pray that God brings you the intelligence to truly see what has happened, heal you of your psychosis, and bring you some level of sympathy for the poor people who have been affected by these cowardly and heinous attacks.<br>

I've read more than a single textbook.  History was a minor of mine in college.  I've read source documents, not just someone else's opinion.  Clearly, that is the source of your &quot;information.&quot;<br>
<br>
Bin Laden's defense budget is second only to ours?  That's rich.  You don't have a clue.  His financial resources have been quite well documented at approximately $200 million, five years ago.  He's spent a lot since then, and doesn't have anything invested anywhere but Afghanistan.  If you think that $200 million is more than a drop in the bucket for dozens and dozens of our allies, then you are absolutely clueless.<br>
<br>
And before you go spouting stuff from the Constitution, perhaps you ought to actually read the thing.  You have no right to say anything in this forum.  It is not a Constitutionally protected public forum.  This has been proven over and over again.  Once you get to 8th Grade and have to study the thing, maybe then you'll understand.  However, based upon your comments thus far, you will never understand anything.<br>

<br>
If you actually read what I posted you'll see I did not defend what IBIAR (not Ibriar) said...or even defend his right to say it. I personally think that such comments were inappropriate at best and should, at least, have been restricted to guildchat where I could have verbally thwaped him. <br>
<br>
All I am defending here is the unwarrented accusation that Mors and VenomsLust/Ibiar are the same person. They are not. As Umbrae has stated, yes Ibiar is rather crass at times and doesnt always have a sense of propriety, but he is not coward enough to hide behind another nick. Do I stand by that defense? yes. Would I defend you were the circumstances reversed? yes. I abhor witchhunts.<br>
<br>
I respectfully ask that you desist with the name calling of my guild and other members of my guild. And from your past posting history, yes, I expect that request to be ignored and the flaming of my character and my guild to begin. <br>

Mors is not Ibiar.  Although Ibiar's post does not reflect my feelings nor my guild's feelings, we live in a country where people are free to express our opinions.  That is one thing that makes this a great country.<br>
<br>
If you feel that people should not be able to express their feelings freely, maybe you should leave the country and go somewhere else and let us enjoy OUR freedom.<br>
<br>
I cannot believe this has gone on so long.  The immaturity here astounds me.  I am through reading this post, I just wanted everyone to know that our guild is not one collective that shares one opinion.  We all think differently.  We all have minds of our own.<br>

There has been a rash of anonymous flames, was well as anonymous supporting posts of others.  I'm not the only one that suggested the use of pseudonyms of either Mors/Ibriar or Chiteng/ksarul.  Go ahead and claim that it's just me, but you'd be wrong.<br>
<br>
I'm real happy you guys aren't all clones.  Fine.  There's plenty of room for disagreement on a lot of things.  Whether the killing of several thousand people was justified is not one of them.  If you want to continue to associate with someone like that (and like it or not, you are judged by the company you keep), then that's your problem.  I would assume that most folks would prefer not to group with Ibriar any longer, or anyone that would justify and rationalize his crude and offensive statements.<br>
<br>
Sure, he's got a right to be an ass.  Not around this board as there are rules and Freedom of Speech means nothing on a private board.  Mind you, I've not advocated the banning of Mors because of what he said (although that's clearly a violation of posting policy), but the chickenshit manner in which he did it by his anonymity.<br>
<br>
Zendell:  I think the comment was fair and accurate.  I posted on your guild board that Ibriar was embarrassing you guys on this board (later noticed I forgot to mention what board, but one of your sharper members figured out how to track it down).  Several of you then march over here and support him, without regard or mention of what he said.  That is foolish and my comment stands.<br>
<br>
I agree with you that the immaturity of Mors and Ibriar is astounding.  Regardless of whether Mors is Ibriar (and you've no evidence to the contrary), the point is that Ibriar basically stated the same thing that Mors did, although in much more detail.  He admitted making the &quot;population control&quot; comments in game.  Whether he's the same person or just someone else that believes the same fucked up things is immaterial.  &quot;Ibriar's&quot; comments are an embarassment to you, or at least should be.  He's beneath contempt, and you guys are nuts if you continue to permit him to be an example of your guild. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/umors.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mors</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=" http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif " BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 8<br> <font color=#E9D756>(9/13/01 12:09:36 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=139.topic&index=73>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: population control</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>

1) Get off this rant and go pray for those in need.<br>

2) Someone speak to Mors/Ibiar about asking Jesus Christ into his heart.  I can see a soul who needs God badly.  <br>

I think its quite obvious what was being done here with this post. <br>
I have 2 suggestions:<br>
1) Get off this rant and go pray for those in need.<br>
2) Someone speak to Mors/Ibiar about asking Jesus Christ into his heart.  I can see a soul who needs God badly. <br>
Four pages of rage.  Go pray people.<br>

Why is it that Chirstians think we all need Jesus? Whats praying gonna do? Im not saying your religion is wrong, but dont tell other people how to live their life...<br>

Let's put it like this:  you go to this new restaurant and order a steak.  Turns out it's the best thing you've put in your mouth.  You tell all your friends &quot;Hey man, you have GOT to try this new place out, they serve the best steak!&quot;  And of course your friends say, &quot;Hey man, don't tell me where I have to eat!&quot;<br>
Same way with Christians pretty much.  They have found something that has made their life whole and they want others to know about it.  No one is forcing you to read/hear what they have to say.<br>
I know I know, it's a crude example, but you get my meaning.  Not a flame, but an explanation.<br>
<br>
Now, more on the subject.  Do you really think we wouldn't have gone to war if the Japanese had bombed our soil and no one was there?  There is no reason at all for them not to evacuate Pearl Harbor if they had known of the attack.<br>

For your inability to see simple logic and or truth, This shall be my last coment to you, or on this thread as it does sadden me to see this many people pissed over somthing they have no controll over. Yet while looking for some sort of outlet for thier rage have turned this into a &quot;Wich Hunt&quot;. Then targeted a freind of mine, as a face they could put to a login an anonmyous login.<br>
<br>
<br>
I Hope you all enjoy randomly pouring over your hatred, and pointing fingers at people, and now entier guilds.<br>
<br>
I shall enter my old state of lurking this board.  (which BTW is how I saw this, not by any statment you made on our guild page.  which I did not see, and will not read)<br>
<br>
And for you Raedwulf I have enven changed my auto sig to a more fitting quote.<br>
<br>
<br>
PS please feel free to rant about how badly misspelled most of this is. I am dislexec and did not feel like involving the time to spell check this.<br>

<br>
I did not tell you how to live your life, I said here are two suggestions <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  (I mean this in the best possible sense).<br>
<br>
As for why do Christians all think we need Jesus in our lives? <br>
<br>
I cannot speak for all Christians, that would be horridly presumptuous, however I will give you my belief.<br>
<br>
Answer:  <br>
<br>
1) Because we all do need Jesus!  We all need the love and hope that Jesus gives us.  And I mean unconditional love.  Love that will never change, never leave you, never betray you, never let you down.  No human on this earth can ever provide that.  I personally, wanted and needed that love in my life, and I have found it.  I have been a Christian since age 15, but I was not walking with God for many years until recently.  I am so glad I am back on track, my life has much more hope and meaning now.<br>
<br>
I also personally believe that all people need that, but that is my belief, and I will not thrust it upon anyone.  I will, however, always try to show you that there is a choice!  We were given free will.  You can choose Jesus or you can refuse him.  You do have that option.  I would not want to be without Him.  If you do, that is your choice.<br>
<br>
2)  The second reason we all (meaning Christians) speak of this is that it was a command of Jesus himself.  He basically commands us to witness to the world and show you that there IS a choice here that you can make.  Speaking for the Christians that I know, myself included, it is a great joy to share the gospel.  No, I do not force it upon those who do not want to hear it, no I am not perfect, yes I make msitakes and basically am like all other humans in this world.  But I have the love of Christ and He does comfort me, and of course I would wish that for any and every person.  All I ever desire is the opportunity to show someone the choice.  It is always their decision.  <br>
<br>
Again, I do not speak for all Christians.  Only for myself, though I am sure some agree with me.  Some do not. <br>
<br>
Someone also, I do not remember who, said something along the lines that this is Mythology.  I do not agree and in fact there is quite a bit of scientific and historical evidence that is non-biblical that documents this.  However, yes, many people have different God(s).  Whether all Gods are God (meaning one) is obviously a reliogious debate which I have netiher the knowledge nor desire to discuss here.  However, I do know of many sources to which I can point you or people whom study this if anyone desires more information on the scientific and historical evidence.  I am not a scholar in this area.<br>
<br>
Now, I shall not speak further on this subject at this time.  This is not a religious board or one in which I wish to cause a religious debate of any kind.  This is my personal belief.  It does not need to be yours.  However, it is my opinion, and as such I expressed it <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
If you or anyone else wants to discuss it further, feel free to email me and we can go into more detail.  As stated before though, I don't believe this is the appropriate place for a spam on this subject.  Though from my long long post, I kinda am breaking my own edict (sorry about that).<br>
<br>
Btw, I'll add you to my prayer list tonight.   /smile<br>

We do not publicize it because that is not our way and frankly, no one elses business.<br>

<br>
&quot;...one of those fucking crossbred Afghanistans...&quot; <br>
<br>
I think there is A LOT of hatred in that statement as well as bigotry.  I've felt a ton of anger coming through these posts. The &quot;fuck you&quot; this and the &quot;fuck you&quot; that.  Can't anyone find another word to express themselves with? When I use language like, to this day (I'm an adult in my 30's) my mother says &quot;Only unintelligent people use language like that.&quot;  There are so many other words we can use that will actually make people stop and think!!! &quot;Fuck you&quot; will only get a &quot;Whatever&quot;.   We are all saddened and affected by the events of Tuesday. We have all lost a lot! Innoncence for one thing - Brothers and Sisters, by the thousands, for another.<br>
<br>
If only we could redirect this anger and put it into something more worth while, like Tolerance.<br>
