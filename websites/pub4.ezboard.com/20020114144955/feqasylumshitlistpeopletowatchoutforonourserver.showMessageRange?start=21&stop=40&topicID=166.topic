I've also had dealings with Uzziel, most notibly some time ago before I could work platinum jewelery (before level 32). I got a tell from Uzziel asking if I could make the 7 int/ 7 str necklace and for some reason I made the mistake of thinking he asked me for the 7 agi/ 7 dex one. I told him yes and quoted a price (the price for the bp choker was like 250 I think...so that should have been a clue ;p). I then met up with him and he obviously figured out it was the incorrect item. The mistake was clearly mine, and I appologized profusely and even offered a substantial discount on the other item he wanted (4 int/ 2 str earrings)...but he was having none of it. He went completly off the handle, yelling to the zone and making nasty tells to me. Certainly, the error was my own...so I suppose that is within his right to do; but it really did seem to be an extreme response. To me, he's somebody that acts before he considers the consequences of those actions.<br>

At this time we only had maybe 3 people over 45 and another 3 over 40..so we really wouldn't be able to put together a good raid. <br>
<br>
Well, Uziell starts saying that he thought we wanted to be a &quot;good&quot; guild and get the &quot;good&quot; loot and how we will never grow if we don't do things like Efreeti raids. Many of us told him we would be happy to do the raids when we had the levels.<br>

As for the other posts, I am a bit puzzled by them as Uzziell is a fellow guildmate of Legacy of Shadows, and these types of actions are not acceptable. I have not had any similiar encounters and was not present at any of these so I cannot address them; however, I was present at 4c when Santik arrived.<br>
<br>
To put the story straight, we were not camping the Temple, but 4c. We had been for at least an hour, trying to get some crusaders to spawn from the corners. It was a guild event and we did NOT have level 50's all over the place. We had two. The rest were lower levels which did the fighting for experience while Uzziell and Istrahd pulled.<br>
<br>
Then Santik arrives, just in time for the first crusader to spawn in one corner! I ask you, do crusaders spawn by themselves? No. You must clear the placeholders for one to spawn. So, before our pullers could get there, Santik immediately jumps on it, no spawn check or anything, and takes the crusader that we worked to spawn. Upon politely advising him of our presence for the 4c, and advising that the temple was free, his attitude was quite rude. He cursed at us and basically told us to f***off. He was very unreasonable and had no respect of our working of the 4c's. So, we said ok, since you refuse to cooperate, we'll just go up to the temple and leave him to try the 4c by himself. What does he do? He interferes again at the temple. It was so bad that the GM ported him and our leaders out to discuss the situation, ending anyones hopes for the armor needed from the crusaders, which Santik did not even need.<br>
<br>
Santik, if you are going to post about someone, at least have the balls to be honest about it. Like I said before, I cannot speak on the other posts about Uzziell, but as for Santik's post, it is entirely invalid. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/beqasylum.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=roxy>Roxy</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>n00b!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(9/26/00 12:49:31 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> I dunno</span><hr size=1> Although i haven't spent my entire time with Santik, when i have been around him, he's been nothing but pleasant to me.

I was right there when the FG dropped and the first thing i see is a wizzie bend over and loot and I knew that was not Karsys. And yes, there was many ooc's saying that only raid leaders can loot. SOrry to burst ur bubble Uzziell, but having seen 6 ooc's saying no looting cept for raid leaders and then having u ninja the PMM and getting kicked out, my thoughts of u aren't too highly.

You may very well be a nice guy, I wasn't saying you weren't because truthfully, I do not know thee. But I do know what happened in CT that day, and my statements are quite accurate. Everyone has a bad day occassionally. That's ok! But lying to smear someone else is just wrong. <br>
<br>
As I said in my prior post, I cannot speak of any of the other posts about Uzziell. They may be true, they may not. I wasn't there. I also am not defending Uzziell in any way concerning CT, just setting the facts straight. Plain and simple, you intruded on our camp of the 4c, which can happen if you didn't know we were camping it, but then, instead of simply apologizing and moving on, you copped an attitude. Like I said, anyone can have a bad day, and I believe you were having just that on this occassion. From the posts, it doesn't appear Uzziell needs any help with degrading his reputation. All I ask you is if you are going to make a post about someone, at least be honest. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ukambok.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kambok</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>w4nn4b3!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(9/27/00 9:34:14 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Uzziell</span><hr size=1> &quot;You did say you were pissed off Santik, inferring that you would act that way if pissed, and trust me, I don't know what your problem was that day, but you were not a happy camper at all, and you were in the wrong.&quot;<br>

&quot;It takes a lot to piss me off and that incident in CT wasnt enough.&quot;<br>
<br>
Note the keyword _WASN'T_. That means _WAS NOT_. <br>
<br>
Meaning your guys actions didnt piss me off. <br>
<br>
Dunno what your trying to pull dude, but your completely wrong. I do not KS from anyone, or would ever take someones camp. You cannot claim the whole 4c for yourselves. There are over 35 spawns there. I never killed a crusader, so I dont know how you came up that I did. What you guys did was wrong. You tried to take a whole camp that 2 groups share together. I was only one person and I was getting exp for being there. You guys werent. Once I said that I was going to be hunting a couple spawns in the temple you guys started shouting in OOC calling me an asshole,jerk, KS'er, and any other name you could possibly call me. <br>
<br>
Now tell me who is in the wrong? a bunch of lvl-50's CLAMING a 35 spawn area to themselves, then verbally abusing someone for entering 'their' area?<br>
<br>
I don't think so Vladamir. What you guys did was wrong and you know it. Dont even try to push the blame onto me. If it was my fault then why didnt the GM tell me to leave? He started laughing when you told him this was our spawn. ITS 35 spawns! The more you decide to prusue this thread will only bring you down more. You guys are in the wrong here bro. <br>
<br>
Can't you take a clue that people dont like your friend? Its not just me, I think if we continue this thread, your name will start to get into the sludge that Uzziell has created.<br>
<br>
<br>
In conclusion, what your are saying happened is wrong, you guys were the pricks, I responded normally to how I treat pricks. If someone calls you many many bad and abusive names you are going to be nice back to them? HELL NO you aren't. Treat others how you want to be treated and life will go much easier for thee.<br>

I do agree that it is an old post and the event did happen some time ago. But you still misquote the facts. We were a low level group with two higher level pullers, and the low levels were there for experience, which we received. We had a great time until the unfortunate encounter with you blew up and ended with the GM ending for all. <br>
<br>
While you point out my oversight in your choice of words &quot;wasn't&quot;, you contradict this by saying you acted the same way as those you accuse. Which you did, and they did. Bottom line, none of the parties involved were polite nor work to any compromise, and names and statements were made by many. Legacy of Shadows are truly a nice group of folks and if you honestly feel that you can generalize us all as being pricks, that's really not fair. For any part I may have contributed to this unfortunate encounter with you, I apologize to you, but blame us all for allowing things to get out of control. I ask that you review your feelings for Legacy of Shadows and that you not pass judgement on those you do not know.<br>
<br>
As for Uzziell, he is a guildmate. I do not defend him in any way on the above matters, including the 4c matter. Honestly, I do not recall Uzziell even being in 4c that day. Istrahd and Milolas were our pullers I believe. The fact of the matter, Santik, is that you, me, and everyone else involved acted like children instead of accepting responsibility to work the situation out to a suitable compromise for all.

<br>
From your post - I am assuming that you got the kill - grats.  If not, correct my thread.<br>
<br>
To the rest,<br>
<br>
I just want you to know a couple things.  Uzziell mainly has been nothing but nice in our guild for sometime.  I am very aware of his &quot;ninja loot&quot; episode and I went to the source - Karsys - and he himself said it was an accident.  To be honest, I am not too offended, but you don't see Thomal's name up here for taking the EM Boots in Hate.  I think Thomal is a good guy - and peeps got over it.  My point - what some call 'ninja' others call accident.<br>
<br>
Now, Uzziell has approached me with concern saying people say things about him that he does not recall.  First, I want you to know, that I know it is not an excuse.  Secondly, I am aware of his RL problems, which is NO EXCUSE either - but I think I have a good grip on where this comes from.  Thirdly, I want to apologize to the Lanys community for tolerating this for so long, as we have tried to help Uzziell get back into the community and instruct him on what would seem common sence.  I do not apologize for trying to help him or giving him a shot - as I see many people want this chance to start over, adn I feel that Uzziell has had that chance with us.<br>
<br>
Tarot warned me of Uzziell - specifically about his anger issues, and she is right about his mood swings.  We have tried to help him in this arena and he has shown a little progress.<br>
<br>
In closing, there are RL circumstances that are affecting his playing, but in the end it is not an excuse nor shall it be tolerated.  Be it known that we are looking into this situation and hope to have some resolve within the week. <p><center>

<br>
However, I urge caution also.  Whether Uzziel and Majestik is the same person is moot...both have/had no respect on the server because of the actions they have taken.  I tend to believe the theory since Majestik's reputation was irreputably damaged after he was found out to be an e-baying merchant, not to mention the numerous run-ins he has had with others, of which Uzziel suffers from the same affliction.<br>
<br>
Everquest is just a game.  The problems these type of players have is more deeply rooted to their personality and upbringing.  In my opinion the true rehabilitation they need has to come in real life.  They need to see a real child/adult psychiatrist, not a virtual one.<br>

<br>
Very true ... as I said, I am aware of personal things, which I will not share due to confidence.  But these things are no excuse for how he has treated people.  You are right, his problems are rooted far more deeper than a game, and do need professional help.  I would not even consider myself someone that could do miracles of that nature, though I do believe that love and correction in a safe environment can do a lot to help a person come to the realization that there is more.<br>
<br>
Thanks for the encouragement.<br>
<br>
As far as Majestik - I have talked to too many people saying that they grouped with him at lower levels (and those people were from IF mainly).  I would need more substancial proof of the this to really believe, because I have dug deep.<br>
<br>
As far as the 'ninja' - it is confirmed and her wears the PMM.  As stated it was an accident, though I agree with others that you don't touch raid stuff period, unless you are a group leader.<br>
<br>
I am aware of other things that are not posted as well that touch personal issues.  I have dug deep and am doing my best to be helpful while not enabling.<br>
<br>
As stated, we are looking into the situation and dealing with it(as best as we can).<br>
<br>
Khan,<br>
Bubba - I trust ya man - where have ye heard that he was Majestik?  I also noticed that Sepnir seems to think that he has Ebayed (pointing to the Majestik thing) maybe it is his last name that is Majestik is why people point to him.  Though - regardless of this connection - he has not proved himself as honorable in and of his name Uzziell. <p><center>

Grief because I am one to believe in the best in people.  I am glad though that I can share the following information so that others will not be burdened as was I.<br>
<br>
When we found Uzziell, he was guildless.  He seemed nice, friendly, and energetic.  I infact help him get his Gnoll Hide Tomb and then he wanted to come to MM with our guild that night for our raid.  So, by the end of the night we embraced him into the guild and he was one of us.<br>
<br>
Then it started - I began to recieve reports about Uzziell from poeple.  The main thing was that he was a 'ninja looter' and a 'backstabber'.  At first - without even looking for the facts - I defended him, because 'how could someone that was so cool have done something wrong?'.  But I inspected him and indeed he wore the Fire Giant Loot as others have posted here.  I began to question him nicely, a little taken aback(but understands why) from Uzziell not sharing the information.  He was defensive and did not want to talk about the situation, but gave me some leads in his speach to me.  So I began to follow those leads.<br>
<br>
The first of many was the fact that it was an Inner Fire raid that he 'ninja-ed' the PMM.  So I went to different individuals.  Some of those included members of the older Rider of Apocolypse as well - and many were furious with him.  Karsys assurred me that it was a mistake/accident - and that Uzziell was in the Lead party - so he was looking at loot.  I took this stance, but now wonder myself ... but in the end will trust Karsys as he is a forthright person.  But all others argued the fact that 'you know the rules - only group leaders loot ...'<br>
<br>
The second lead me to Tarot, whom I had only met in passing - seen perhaps on sister isle a few times ... but I was told that Tarot held the story and that she spoke the truth without hesitation and without remorse of it's cutting edge.  Paraphrased, 'Do not trust him.  He is a backstabber and not everything is right within his head.'  She also pointed me to Alydra.  Alydra had stated that she was not the GL at the time, but apparently Uz had died in SK and needed a rez and the only cleric that was around (due to the fact that it was early AM) was deep in a dungeon group and would not leave his group for thier safeties sake.  Uz became quite heated and began to cuss on guild chat.  When the GL told him to chill out, log and come back in the morning - and then he could get a rez.  Uzziell proceeded to say things that Alydra would not repeat, but basically threatened the GL with physical viloence to his family and himself.  The GL was ported out to the Karanas and Uzziell was promptly removed.<br>
<br>
Well, I see this thread becoming a book, so I will attempt at shortening it some.  I took these warnings back to the guild initially and the responce was 'Well we haven't seen any of this yet.&quot;.  But in time - while camping the SMR and Runed Cowl with Uzziell I seen some of his anger flare up - not so much at me - but others.  I asked him if he was ok - and he would say yes - and then mumble about needing more to drink.  I will not bare everything that Uzziell has told me about his circumstances - for that wouldn't be fair, but I can share this much.  It was times like these - that when I would confront him later about his anger or his Sh*tlistings that he would say 'Man - I don't know where people get this - I don't remeber any of this.'.  I then realized that his drinking problem based of real life dependancies, was very severe.  These moments of 'black-out' continued - but we tried our best to encourage Uz through this - that there was more in life ... (but as posted above - Virtual Counseling - just does not cut it for RL problems)  It was during these times that I was trying to rebuild his reputation, like get him to the planes, and I mainly raid with RoF - and it was RoF that told me the story of the time that Uzziell was in their guild and when they hadn't wanted to camp the SMR that he went off on them.  In fact a certain person from RoF absolutely refuses to group with Uzziell on planes raids to the point of leaving.<br>
<br>
So time progresses and I begin to talk with the guild officers that we should put Uz on probation and if he gets Sh*t Listed again or attacks another officer verbally that he is kicked out and will be posted.  Then comes RoF's fear raid last week - and the break went bad.  Uzziell just goes off on his group cussing and vile things.  Milolas, an officer in Dark Whispers is the Team Lead - and tries to diffuse the situation.  Uz blows up all over him and Milolas calls me on my Nextel and tells me if this continues then he will kick Uz himself from the group.  Uz then contacts me and begins to flame into me.  Stuff about the carmine robe - and stuff about how he could lead better (only his second time to Fear and only his First on the break).  I try to point this out to him and to be patient - and he goes off on me. Cussing and belittling me.  So now I am hurt that it has come to this.  IF saves the day in Fear - raid goes on and Uzziell is cheery as can be.<br>
<br>
We escalate the matter to the officers - and the more recent posts and his membership and probation are to be voted on.  Then comes this weekend - once again - Uz was supposed to go to Fear with RoF.  He sleeps in over the time for insert - partially cause I told him the wrong time.  Pimm waits a full hour before even starting insert - and Uz still doesn't show.  2 hours into the Raid - after break and some pulls are happeneing - Uz gives a tell wanting to know if he can come in.  I ask Pimm - the answer is 'No - not atm' - I relay the message and Uzziell gets upset.<br>
<br>
Last Night - I am going to Fear with T'Vyl Honor Guard, and Uz send me a tell - 'You going to Fear?' I say yes and his reposonce is 'Must be nice!'.  He then goes into Guild Chat and declares our next raids ... and no one responds - and then he blows up.  Basically that we are a guild that doesn't want to do anything.  But it is violent in nature.  I try to give him tells asking him what is up and he LAYS into me with such foulness - I could not believe the lines of text that came up on the screen.  It boiled down to the fact that HE HELPED us get all this stuff and no one HELPED HIM.  Even when I pointed out the countless raids - his reputation that I was trying to rebuild - even the Gnoll Hide Tomb - he denied any of it as valid and FLAMED more.  He had wanted GEBS and we hadn't had the Freet group thrown together yet.  He removed himself from the guild and in a matter of 4 more paragraphs from him - I put him on ignore as I couldn't take the abuse any further.<br>
<br>
What more need I say?  That HE was on the Fear raid where Venr and I lead a rag muffin band to destroy Cazic Thule (how many peeps get to kill gods) and that he got his Carmine Arms on that trip.  That I begged Pimm to give him a chance - even after he came to HATE for his first time only to Gate out when he got attacked - and Pimm honored me so much that he gave Uz a second and third chance.  That I tried to be his friend in the midst of his conflict irl and on the server and still have not betrayed his confidence in me about his personal life.<br>
<br>
Once again I am burned for not listening to the voices of the multitudes.  I guess I jsut give people too much benefit of the doubt, believing in redemption.<br>
<br>
In closing, DO NOT INVITE UZZIELL to your guild.  He might be nice for the moment - BUT there is an ulterior motive behind him.  HE IS NOT stable.  His mood swings HIGH and LOW - this due to RL things.  Even the things you do for him are forgotten in a momment of 'BUT YOU DIDN'T GET ME THIS!!!'.  And Uzziell if you are reading this - go back and read through all the posts - you have hurt and mislead some dear people on the server like Tanaman and Cicely.  It may be a game, but you are ruining it for other people by your attacks and in the end like Gratiano says &quot;Who do you have standing around you?&quot; - your answer is going to be &quot;no one&quot; if you don't stop. <p><center>

I was saddened because of the way he treated me.  His anger and attitude always seem to surface when he doesn't get his way.  On the fear raid I was about to kick him from my group, my own guildmate!  His GREAT idea was to have a cleric and a teleporter zone in and rez and teleport the people out one at a time, claiming that HIS way would be much faster.  Anyone who has done fear knows that if the break goes bad, a long cr is expected.  A group of 2 (cleric and teleporter) would zone in and die before the cleric could even cast rez.  I tried to explain this and I got the &quot;shut the F%$k up. You dont know jack $hit&quot;, among other foul language.<br>
     The longer I play this game, the more I begin to realize that people who are over level 50 and guildless are PROBABLY that way for a reason.  Our guild has gone through recent changes (most left Legacy to reform Dark) and we knew Uzziell was a risk.  I, like Istrahd, believe in forgivness and in human spirit.  We gave you every chance Uzziell, tried to understand and help you.  You helped our lower level peeps and we helped you.  I even got you into the hole with CoT the other night, where your loam drops, in an attempt to show that you were not the wicked person your reputation makes you out to be.<br>
     After listening to your repeated threats, over the last 5 months, of &quot;Im gonna leave the guild&quot;, and, &quot;Im not gonna play EQ anymore&quot; in an attempt to gain sympathy, I am glad that you at least had the balls to actually do it this time.  You removed yourself from the guild.  Your harrassing tells and foul language will not be missed.  Your friendship and giving attitude (at times) will be. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/utyriontreeblade.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tyrion Treeblade</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>p0\/\/3r-p0sT3r!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(10/27/00 8:43:16 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.computer-guidance.com/t/smpictyrion.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Uzziell has lef Dark Whispers</span><hr size=1> Wow.<br>
