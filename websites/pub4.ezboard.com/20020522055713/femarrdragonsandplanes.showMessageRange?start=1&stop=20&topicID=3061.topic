How dare you criticize Galathorn for having 'wrong' reasons to vote no for a potential member. Do you want me to forward you a copy of my probie threads? You should re-read what you wrote. You might find it enlightening. Nearly two years ago, when I was a dumbass level 40 newbie and I made a mistake. I didn't have a very good understanding of the game, I hadn't even been playing for all that long. I apologized for my mistake because that's the type of person I am. Quick to anger, and quick to forgive. The fact that you refuse to accept that is your problem not mine. You stated in the first thread about me that your 'one' flaw was your inability to forgive. Well Chaya, all I have to say to you is remember that next time you fuck up, because no bodies perfect and it happens to all of us. Remember your one flaw when you require forgiveness from another.<br><br><br>&quot;Galathorn,<br>That is one of the worst reasons I have ever seen for a veto.&quot;<br><br>Laff,<br>   You're some piece of work, Gallux. This almost tops your 'You should give XXXXXX a chance, <br>because I gave Nire a fair chance.' remark. At least Chaya doesn't post under false pretenses. I hope you don't think people actually think believe the transparent reasons you posted on my thread(s). While you're a lot of things, your definately not stupid.<br><br>    For the record, I don't have any feelings on the probie who's thread this came from. I like to actually get to know someone before I make my decisions about them. I wonder how you folks would feel if Galathorn had an old friend who hasn't been on a single MF raid and most likely doesn't even wear the guild tag come vote no so he/she doesn't make it in a la Asotus. The greatest irony is that both of you would fare as bad or worse as me in a vote of your peers. Luckily for you, there aren't periodic reviews.<br><br>P.S.<br>Jubei, I know I said some really nasty things to you in the past...but I really respect the stance you took. Either I was wrong about you, or ya changed.
