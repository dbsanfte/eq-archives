A level 20 melee wearing FBSS at 22% haste does X + 22% damage.<br>
A level 20 melee wearing CoF at 36% does X + 22% damage.<br>
<br>
Why? Because there is a maximum haste cap that raises with levels. Someone under level 60 cannot achieve 100% haste, even if they have spells and equipment that would give a level 60 100% haste. So even though the level 20 above with the CoF has a haste *potential* of X + 36%, he cannot get the full haste because it is capped lower.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

<br>
WHO CARES ABOUT HASTE CAPS AT LEVEL 20? For god's sake, since you have enough brain cells to type, try using a few of them to think for a change, or check out <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.dictionary.com/search?q=non+sequitur&r=3">www.dictionary.com/search...quitur&r=3</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--> There is no focus cap that anybody has reported. A spell cast by a level 1 is focused by the same amount as the same spell cast by a level 60. <br>
<br>
The correct analogy here is to haste items that only work on certain quality of weapons. For example, FBSS would only work on 1h weapons with MN/del of 1.0 or worse (yak quality). RBG would only work on 1.7 or worse (lam quality), etc. Once a melee has acquired an FBSS, he has a minimum 22% damage increase FOREVER, regardless of how his character progresses or the quality of weapon used. When a caster gets a focus II item, he gets a TEMPORARY damage/efficiency increase that goes way down or disappears altogether as his character progresses. Why is it so hard to understand the difference?<br>

1) I don't play this game in the normal sense, haven't in about a year and a half, and never will again. That makes it slightly difficult to be &quot;held down&quot;.<br>
<br>
2) I'm impressed. No, really. If you want to talk smack, where were you when I was playing? By my fuzzy recollection, I remember doing 14 server first ubers, and 7 of those were game-wide 1-4ths. How many have you done? And where's your title from top 4 on Test in the BotB? Who's the gimp again?<br>
<br>
3) If you'd actually bothered to read and understand my post, you'd see that I said that uber loot should have a higher focus percentage than anything else. It doesn't seem like rocket science to me that the focus percentage you get should scale based on the quality of loot you have, but evidently that's well beyond your grasp. If VI doesn't want lvl 1 players to have high focus percentages, they already have the mechanism in place.. recommended level.<br>
<br>
VI's intent was to balance casters and melee at high level, but these changes only balance &quot;uber&quot; players. Casters get minimal, if any, benefit from Focus II items, and Focus III is generally inaccessible. That's not balance. Now, before one of you even thinks it, I am NOT suggesting that a casual level 60 caster should be balanced with an uber melee. Having 30% or 35% focus items attainable like RBG and CoF are attainable (and lower percentage items as common as FBSS)would balance the casual casters. Keeping the 40% focus items on ubermobs would balance uber casters with uber melee and still keep the best loot on the ubermobs, as it should be. (again, percentages are for comparison only, and probably need to be reduced by 25-50%)<br>
<br>
To those of you saying that casters got something and should shut up and be happy with it, EA great big D. The implementation is logically flawed and doesn't address the problems it was meant to address. When did pointing out obvious flaws and suggesting simple improvements/alternatives become a bad thing?  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/bemarr.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=zakiku>Zakiku</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 19<br> <font color=#E9D756>(6/7/02 11:42:05 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3394.topic&index=23>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> RE:RE</span><hr size=1> Umm, my mistake.. doesn't have that effect anymore /sigh. well back to it being resist gear i guess hehe <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uyttriaduvain.showPublicProfile?language=EN>YttriaDuvain</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 52<br> <font color=#E9D756>(6/7/02 2:01:26 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3394.topic&index=24>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: VI needs to withdraw head from ass</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> So let me get this straight.<br>

<br>
Forgive us if we have a beef with the piss poor planning/design/testing/implementation of this.  It is a great idea for adding the focus effects, but no one seemed to take any kind of impact analysis on what items to add the effects to, and what those effects will be. <br>
<br>
BTW: your line about the huge benefit to all casters is incorrect. Anyone who cannot camp NTOV or kill king Tormax cannot have a good majority of the effect III items, so no, not all casters benefit from this.<br>

On the other hand, I think they should have made level 3 effect spells of level 55 and under, and reserve a level 4 (60 and under) effect for NToV type encounters. Possibly a level 5 (60 and under but better effects) for those people crazy enough to spend all that time getting to VT, or doing 1000 mob ring quests. I just don't understand the huge difficulty gap between getting level 2 and level 3 items, as currently implemented. Basically most new casters would lose the usefullness of their hard won (or bought) focus items for 11 levels and a lot of time (assuming new spells roughly at 49). <br>
<br>
  I thought the casters were considered okay below 50 by VI for the most part. I do like that there are focus items for all levels, although I'd like to see more no drop items for low levels to encourage dungeon adventuring. I do say that it's way too early to blow up about it, but a few polite letters to Absor might be better than ranting here. At least it might make clear how &quot;screwed&quot; 50s casters are for focus items. ;-P<br>

The implementation sucks.<br>
<br>
The idea of level I, II, and III based on spell levels is just terrible.  There should also be a power increase, i.e. level I 5%, level II 15%, level III 25%, for example.  <br>
<br>
There is so much wrong with this game already, though, so what's one more ridiculous design flaw?<br>
<br>
To name but a few of the most glaring problems in EQ, though many will argue these aren't flaws simply because they've gotten so used to the way EQ works:<br>
<br>
1.  Mobs are much more powerful than players.  Even con should be even strength.  They should have the same hit points, same abilities, etc.  A mob that is much more powerful than you are should con RED, not blue.<br>
<br>
2.  Mobs should not be able to be pulled.  As is, they have to be, because of #1 (mobs are much more powerful than players).  Multi-mob fights would be a hell of a lot more fun.  As is, dealing with 10 unmezzable mobs would pretty much slaughter your average 6-man group.<br>
<br>
3.  Mobs are too easily dealt with.  Again, because of #1, they have to make very effective spells like slow, mez, snare, etc.  If mobs were only as powerful as players, they wouldn't have to put in ridiculously stupid spells that stopped a mob cold for minutes at a time.  This is the equivalent of a spell in D&amp;D, 1st level, hold person, make a saving throw at -10, if you fail, you are held for 1247234894623478246878 rounds.  Get the picture?  It's stupid.  None of mez/snare/etc. should be reliable; it should all be short duration, very hard to land, stuff.  But because of #1, mobs HAVE to be handled with these extreme effects like slow, else they'd just hit too hard.<br>
<br>
4.  Complete heal is utterly ridiculous.  This spell, like an un-errata'd Heal/Harm in 3rd Edition D&amp;D, is way overpowered.  It should not be necessary, but it is because of #1.  If this spell had never been created, clerics could have continued to progress in healing abilities to level 60, axp, and beyond.  Instead, we get our best spell at level 39 and never get any other spell that can top this one.  (At the very least, why not a faster-by-half-a-second, uses 20 less mana CH or some other minor upgrade?)  <br>
<br>
5.  Ubermobs are stupid.  You have ridiculously powerful ubermobs that can kill hordes of players.  Instead of having a less powerful mob with legions of cronies, you get a mob meant to be fought many-against-one.  Well, gee, how do we even make that a contest?  Oh, I know, make it hit for 1000x4.  OK, so keep it on the tanks and heal them.  How stupid is that though?  If the mob had any AI at all, it would just kill all the clerics first.  I know, I know, it's only a game, I shouldn't be too critical for lack of realism... but still.  A dragon backed up by 8 drakes (hmmm, sound familiar to anyone?) that all had to be fought at once would be a super-cool fight!  Why were ubermobs designed this way in the first place?  Because of #4 (complete heal), of course.  Once they'd made this spell, they had to make mobs that could hit ridiculously hard in order to try to get through waves of CH's landing every few seconds.  <br>
<br>
6.  The xp system is terrible.  OK, so they fixed hybrid xp penalties and hell levels, but there are still huge problems.  The most obvious one has to do with the con system.  Every mob of a particular level gives the same amount of xp.  Nagafen is blue to me and would only give the same xp as any other mob of his level (if there were one in SolB).  I remember in the 2nd edition D&amp;D monster manual, there were rules for creating your own monster.  Adding all these abilities, like spellcasting, immunity to +1 or lower weapons, flying, etc etc., added an 'xp cost' to the creature, in addition to its basic hit dice.  EQ xp all just goes off the level (HD) of the mob.  This is pathetic.  Why should I bother killing mobs in Acrylia (for example) with extra hit points when I am not going to get any more xp for it?  For example, let's consider goranga scouts.  Why would anyone bother to kill them?  They have too many hps, and so don't give good xp.  If xp were implemented correctly, goranga scouts would be worth MORE xp for having more hps, and people wouldn't mind camping them because the xp wouldn't be so bad.  Same with a rubble rouser in Akheva.  It takes forever to kill it, so it should give a lot more xp than a normal mob of its level.  The reason many mobs in EQ are never even touched is because they don't give the xp that they SHOULD give for the difficulty it takes to kill them.  XP solely based on mob level is insanely stupid.<br>
<br>
7.  Loot and quests and other content have gotten out of control.  VI just has too many designers who have worked on EQ over the years.  They just haven't looked at what has gone before.  Quests get partially implemented then abandoned (the worst I can remember in recent years was the Matter of Betrayal/Greenmist quest, which took ages for VI to realize it just had never been finished and to put in a totally different quest to replace it).  Items get put in uber zones (Ssra, e.g.) that are not close to the level of quality as items in zones from previous expansions (ToV, e.g.).  I'm not saying that every item from a new zone should be better, but if the zone is harder, a significant portion of them should be.  To VI's credit, they seem to be getting better about this in recent weeks with upgrades to  Ssra loot, etc.<br>
<br>
8.  Camping/static spawns.  Static spawns.  UGH.  What more is there to say about these?  A friend of mine once suggested that most mobs in EQ should not spawn singly, but in groups (as has been implemented since in other mmorpgs).  Pulling could be made impossible with this one simple change.  All mobs would spawn and come in groups.  In addition, different numbers or types of mobs could spawn (as will be the case in SWG).  I like certain rare spawns spawning in certain locations, i.e. if you make a throne room, put the Goblin King there, by all means... but lots of other spawns could be 'mixed up' to provide more variety.  <br>
<br>
9.  Lack of any sort of roleplaying setting.  The game has been out for 3 years, and they've never made any effort to make you feel like you're really in any kind of actual fantasy world.  They don't change the world around.  Most of us have gotten used to the fact EQ is really a glorified Quake/3D-slaughterhouse kind of game and has nothing to do with a real roleplaying game like, say, Ultima VII (yeah, I know, old, single person rpg, but it's an rpg nonetheless), which tries to make a real setting for you to immerse yourself in.  No guildhouses, no ability to build anything in game, no real interaction with GM-controlled characters (they basically just attack and kill you), no encouragement/reason for guilds to interact with each other...  I've long since abandoned any hope that EQ will ever be this way.  A lot of my roleplaying-oriented friends have higher hopes for SWG.  We'll see.<br>
<br>
10.  Text interface.  The text interface to EQ is pathetic.  They've had 3 years to do something, anything, with it, and they still haven't done so.  I can log into any text-based MUD and get functionality that far surpasses that of EQ.  No counting mechanisms (ok, so forget about server, can I at least get smaller subsets counted?), no messaging mechanism, a pathetically weak /who command, the list goes on and on.<br>
<br>
I am very excited to see what new games will bring.  EQ was wonderful for its time, but it has shown a complete inability to change, adapt, try new things.  As such, it will soon (imo) be going the way of the dodo.<br>

You fools keep whining and carrying on about the small part of this and you might just end up Pissing them off and not get anything. Take what you have and play with it and in the next few months bigger and better will be coming out. But in a couple months when you all have made asses of yourselves and VI says go jump in a lake and takes it all away you will be back here Complaining again. Its a game have fun playing it. And if you just have to have items given to you then pay the extra and move to the pansy server where they give you the items on a silver platter. In the mean time instead of ranting and flaming on this board get in the game and see what you can earn. <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=164500 target=_new>Afferon's Magelo Profile</a><BR>

<br>
It's not like getting a 12/18 +6 to all resists sword from a bat in GFay. This would be an obvious mistake in their code. I would be expecting a nerf, and kill as much as I could until they realized it.<br>
<br>
But, 15% longer buffs doesn't translate into very much even with Aegolism. I thought it was nice, but nothing to write home about. <br>

I guess they see it as more of a treasure than I do.<br>

The general statement however stands true. No one is guaranteed anything in this game other then being able to log in (and sometimes not even that).

<br>
That means, for free or 30pp or whatever you can have the EXACT same focus effect as the one from an NToV raid. <br>
<br>
You pay for that focus effect with a little plat or a little effort in walking over to a mage.<br>
<br>
The &quot;ubers&quot; pay for their focus effect with hour after day after week of raiding, hard work, and losing more xp per week on raids than most of the people complaining make in a month.<br>
<br>
You get the same effect, you pay what you want to. Nobody's saying you can't get the other items, just get up off your ass and earn it, don't expect it to be handed to you. <p>______________

<br>
I mean honestly, what the @#%$ would be the point if all casters were identicle at every level?  The thing I hated the most levelling up all those years ago was the fact that every dipshit that barely even knew what the @#%$ they were doing had the same exact spells as me simply because most were bought from a vendor and the research ones were a joke to buy off someone with the skill.<br>
<br>
Think how I felt working research to be no-fail at all level 49, then when casting it, see other wizards toss one out and get mauled a second later because they were too stupid to control their aggro.  This was made even worse with the introduction of concussion, but even I abuse that tool now so I can't go into that topic.<br>
<br>
I like the ancient spells idea very much..and the focus items(tho I despise the fact that my BCG got changed from improved damage 3 to extended affliction 3), because it means I have an edge over others of my class to look forward to after all the work put into my char.  Although I do think making superior sundering drop off emporer was a *little* bit much. <p><center><img src=" http://home.btconnect.com/Lindzc/mage.gif"><i><b><font size="4" face="BlackChancery"><font color="red"><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=8859>Ramierez D`Elerian Draegonis</a></i></b></font></font><img src=" http://home.btconnect.com/Lindzc/mage.gif"><i><b><font size="2" face="Ariel Narrow"><font color="blue"><br>A Wizard's soul is forged in the crucible of magic.~~Antimodes of the White Robes.</i></b></font></font></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uchiteng.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Chiteng</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 1184<br> <font color=#E9D756>(6/8/02 9:08:46 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3394.topic&index=39>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Rameirez</span><hr size=1> Up to a point I agree, except.....<br>
<br>
The way things are NOW, the game is totally politics at the top. Now thats great<br>
if your lucky enough or smart enough, or savvy enough to get people to help you.<br>
However, there are those who play EQ that are shall we say, 'less' able to<br>
persuade people that they should give them 36 hours on a weekend their time,<br>
and then not resent it that you utilize that time to help yourself and not them.<br>
<br>
The rationales are many but at the top, the raids do NOT help every guild member.<br>
PERIOD. eventually like once a month, you 'might' pick up an item of power.<br>
'maybe' UNLESS of course the people running the guild selfishly allocate all the goodies to a select few, and rationalize why that is a good idea.<br>
<br>
This would NOT be needed if the game didnt demand that extraordinary time<br>
commitment for relatively minor gains.<br>
<br>
The structure of the game IS flawed. <p>“It is clear that the individual who persecutes a man, his brother, because he is not of the same opinion, is a monster.”
