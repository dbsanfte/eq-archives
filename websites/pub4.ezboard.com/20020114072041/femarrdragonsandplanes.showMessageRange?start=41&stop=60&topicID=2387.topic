I know of some Afghani people here who call themselves Persian because they speak Farsi. (the Iranian/Afghanistan language, not Arabic).<br>
<br>
However it is my belief that those who call themselves Persian, are from Iran, and not Afghanistan.<br>

<br>
First off, I believe Qundi 100% and stand behind him.  If he lied about it, I'd be shocked and very disappointed.  The Knights of Virtue do not let people join that would lie or change the truth to something that would get someone else in trouble.  I was in KoV (got kicked out because of bug and haven't rejoined with Liddar), and they are the most noble guild I've ever met and been associated with.  All these people that are saying 'I want proof, blah blah blah', you'd just say 'Oh yeah.. right..you just changed it' or some shit like that.  And how many times have you dealt with situations where you are so busy that you forget to take a screenshot?  Hell the only time I ever take a screenshot is when my keyboard bumps my desk and hits the - button.<br>
<br>
As for the GM, I believe I have encountered him once or twice.  I don't like most GMs just because some of the policies made are ridiculous that they have to enforce.<br>
But this is a ridiculous thing, and believe that it definitely is possible.  People have been treating middle east citizens here in the US like shit the past week just because of this latest incident.  <br>
<br>
Anyway, whatever..  I believe Qundi, Honir, and the rest who have been associated with this problem in what they have said.<br>

Ka.... Ki... Ah damnit, how ever the hell you spell it, is in deep shit.  What makes me sick is this is happening everywhere.  I turned on the radio while I was getting ready one morning, and heard about parents pulling children out of classes, just cause there were some Afghanistani children in the same class.  Someone may flame me for this, but I hate to hear people say something along the lines of &quot;We should nuke Afghanistan of the face of the earth.&quot;<br>
<br>
Yes, I do believe that we should take action against this recent tragedy.  Those that did this should pay.  I felt like throwing up just watching the news and seeing what happened (But thankfully I don't eat breakfast, and happened before lunch, but I ended up not eating lunch either).  I just don't think all of Afghanistan should pay, for what Terrosits/Leaders did.  Are we really that blood thirsty that we feel the need to kill more innocent people?  Haven't enough innocents died already?  Don't you think there has been enough pain already?  <br>
<br>
Anyway, I got a bit of subject.  I really don't know who's side to take.  I haven't had much contact with the new GM, nor did I ever know Qundi.  All I can say is that if this did happen, there should be some actions taken to see that this GM no longer works for Verant.  I just hate seeing so much hate in the world. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>"There is only one quality worse then hardness of the heart, and that is softness of the head."

<br>
regarding why the absense of replies to specific questions stated:<br>
<br>
1. this person has no need to defend themselves to us based on a) after the alleged incident occurred, the &quot;vicitim&quot; went to trusted friends with a serious request for advice on how to handle the situation, this person DID NOT, nor do i get the feeling EVER INTENDED TO, make this a public scene.  b) if this person has any tiny bit of intelligence, the realization that arguing points with people on this message board will get one absolutely nowhere, as people in general can always twist words/statements, find holes, discredit evidence (that was first asked for), or plain out disbelieve whatever is said. <br>
<br>
2. having dealt with racism all my life, i've developed a few views on the subject.  some people become outraged and speak out forcefully against those who wrong them in this way.  some people just shrug it off as &quot;just the way it is&quot; and go on with their own lives letting others live in the ignorance of such hatred.  and of course, there are all the shades of gray in the middle.  reading the one post made by the actual &quot;victim&quot;, i have no problem believing their reaction to the situation.  according to the original poster, the &quot;victim&quot; here was accused of trying to use their heritage as a means of gaining attention, which is something i see others here on this boards saying as well.  this alone is reason enough for anyone who was truly transgressed upon to try to stay as quiet as possible.  the louder they yell and shout their pain, the louder their opposers will yell that they are just looking for attention.  <br>
<br>
3. i can't state this enough, this person didn't want this to be a huge public issue.  the steps are being taken, as stated by people here to defend the &quot;victim&quot; from peers (how sad is that...) to get this resolved.  regardless of how it plays out, this person can take comfort in the fact that they took the correct course of action, and their friends stood behind them along the way.  THAT will be all that counts, not all of us demanding proof of an atrocity committed.  <br>
<br>
i can tell you all right now, if something happened to me and i went to my friends and asked them for advice on how to proceed after an incident i was unsure of, and one of my concerned friends brought it to this message board to make others aware of a possible wrongdoer in a position of power, i would leave it at that, just as our &quot;victim&quot; here has done.  the warning has been sent, it is up to each person to tread cautiously regarding the information, or to disregard it.  i most certianly would not come here and defend myself on this message board, or any other.  all the people that matter will be informed, and to be totally honest, none of us matter, we will not be the ultimate deciders of how this will turn out.<br>
<br>
it is quite possible that the whole thing is made up, but we don't know, and most points in arguments against can be countered, and those can be countered again by the other side of the debate.  but we really do need to remember, this is not a &quot;topic&quot; or an &quot;issue&quot; being debated here.  it is a real person, with a heart, a soul, made of flesh and blood.  someone who can read these posts and be wounded, the affects of a horrid experience made so much worse by clean cut words of their peers.  so if you don't believe what happened, of course, by all means, you have the right to say that you don't believe it, but if you have ever had something horrible happen to you, and people wouldn't believe you, just remember that before you push this.  be skeptical, but please, be compassionate as well.  the truth of the situation will reveal itself eventually, and then judgements will be warranted, but not yet.<br>

What about the guide?  What if he is the innocent person that this is happening to?  Why should we believe one version (without names, logs, screenshots) and not the other?<br>
<br>
Innocent until proven guilty; we have nothing but hearsay to base our judgement on, a judgement that could ultimately cost a person their job.<br>

<br>
you'll note that i did not say that one story was true and one was not.  i simply said that we, collectively speaking, do not know the truth of the matter, and therefore cannot pass judgement.  if it makes you feel better, you can extend all that i said to the opposite side of the argument regarding the guide/gm and i would agree with you.  but i didn't see anyone saying that the guide and/or the gm were guilty of the crime, just that IF they were, that action should be taken.  while i DID see people blatantly calling the &quot;victim&quot; a liar and a glutton (essentially) for attention as well as a horrible person for &quot;using this tragedy to gain attention&quot;.  that is a huge difference.<br>
<br>
arikel,<br>
<br>
i WOULD agree with your sarcastic scenario IF he (the &quot;victim&quot;) was the one who was out here calling for us to try to get someone fired/banned/somehow punished, but he did not.  he did not even bring it to our attention, someone else did.  and unless you think it's some great conspiracy on the part of the entire guild, your comparative situation falls horribly short of it's mark.<br>

Having been in customer service jobs for a great deal of my life, I have a hard time believing that the GM (Kaikichi? or some such thing) would be so obviously racist while on his job.<br>
<br>
It's one thing to be racist to someone when you're just out on the street or in a department store, when you're relatively anonymous and there's no reprocussions as long as you don't become violent.  But it's another thing entirely to be on the job and racist to one of your customers.  It's basically a guarantee to get yourself fired.<br>
<br>
My personal thoughts on the matter are that Qundi isn't being entirely honest with people.  There's a part of his interaction between himself and the GM that is not being shown here.  Like it or not, Kaikichi is not all powerful.  And no matter how racist he might be, he has to play by the rules that Verant lays down for their GM's.<br>

<br>
I wasn't commenting so much on Qundi himself as on the attitude that seems popular here, that the GM should be fired based on hearsay.  Sorry for the confusion.  My point was, it's silly to assume Qundi's story is true just because it pushes your emotional buttons .  Kaikachi may have banned Qundi based on his ethnic background, but so far all we have to base that on is a statement by Qundi.  If Qundi was banned for something else altogether, then I'd say he may have a vested interest in making his friends and peers believe this story.  <br>
Interestingly enough, the Bubu thing did actually happen.  Whether he really trained me, I trained my group accidentally, or whether the situation was a result of confusion between two groups with FD-capable members, I don't know.  That's why it would have been ridiculous to come here demanding that Bubu be banned.  The same logic applies here.<br>

Kanya, after rereading your last post I think we're basically saying the same thing.  I see a lot of people here basically pointing the finger at Kaikachi, and I don't think we have enough information to really be doing that just yet.  The same applies to Qundi.  It's possible Qundi may have reason to mislead his guildmates, and we don't have any statement at all from Kaikachi or VI.<br>

<br>
If the story played out the way it was relayed, this GM is screwed.  The conversation will have been logged at the server side and, any attempt to circumvent that or cover it, will be obvious and will be a sign of guilt.<br>
<br>
I was an employee of Sony for many years and it is an extremely diverse company where racism is not tolerated.  A *hint* of something like this will cause termination and loss of benefits immediately.  It's not the kind of company where, for better or worse, they will extend the benefit of doubt to the employee.  A bit of evidence that something like this was true would be enough... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/udinuvenstratocaster.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dinuven Stratocaster</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 274<br> <font color=#E9D756>(9/18/01 10:37:41 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> /wave kanya :) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uqundi.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Qundi</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#E9D756>(10/6/01 10:47:31 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Qundi Speaking</span><hr size=1> Sorry for not replying earlier, i will try to answer all the questions. <br>
1. I am from Afganistan, my father and his come from Mey-maneh and i am told come from a long lineage of sheep herders. I claim persian because i am proud of the empire, and yes this empire did span to both Afganistan Pakistan and parts of India.<br>
<br>
2. Verant is not doing anything about it, i have been trying nonstop for 3 to 5 weeks to be contacting them with uses of electronic mail and the telephone. all responses i have received explain that i need contact another person, who in turn informs me to go back to starting position. <br>
<br>
3. The only proof of these actions are my /reports i made of the GM, but very unfourtanately i was informed they deleted those a week ago.<br>
<br>
4.  My father came to the US because this was a land of equality, and until recently i loved and enjoyed that fact. Is there a hate between blacks and whites, i have never noticed such. Just curious of course.<br>
<br>
5. I have considered legal actions, but Sony Interactive is both ignoring my emails and those of 2 lawyers (names Johnathan Schneider and Helmut Strauss from my city) and legal advisor Dr. M. Crouse from Chicago. It distresses me that they will not even listen when 4 points of illegal actions were brought before them. Not all of these points are dealing with my case, Crouse has long been investigating their totalitarian (that word may be wrong, but general meaning the same) actions. <br>
<br>
6. I have never in the past had wrong dealings with a GM, and i will now tell you my history with gms as much as i can recall:<br>
lv 10ish won right to share camp in butcher block<br>
lv20 exactly asked gm to help a friend get married<br>
lv 17 with different character, GM changed name from keapponlaffin to elhejaja. <br>
In none of these did i refuse a gms rules etc. On top of this i conveyed no message to the gm except asking why and giving him information about myself (age, name, email adress, credit card number)<br>
<br>
7. The members of the group said such things as &quot;You arabs are all gonna burn in hell for what you did&quot; and disbanding me from group shortly after.<br>
<br>
8. To answer chuck, name Liedman, lv 27 (my highest is 40), zone hhk, group members cant remember, hurtful american slang prompted me to petition, i can quote hakaichi (sorry i misspelled his name) he stated at the very end &quot;Well you have two options, you can either tell me you're not arab and be suspended for 9 days, or you can continue with this and i will ban your account&quot;<br>
What i said just before this was (not exact quote, but close), &quot;I fail to understand your logic, I have told you time and time again everything you want to know, i am leaving no information hidden from you, why are you doing this?&quot;<br>
I told my heritage because they asked me, they were talking about a musician i hadnt heard of, and they asked where i was from. <br>
Persia spanned from turkey to india all the way south into israel. How can you say they are only iran? Are only those on the east coast true americans?<br>
<br>
9. Everything Honir says it true, i thank him for taking better note of this then i, i hoped my /reports would be read by another Gm or guide then kaikachi. You dont have to believe me, it doesnt really matter to me. I only wish to report this injustice. Do i want back on eq, sure i do, its a nice game. But if i had to chose between getting my account back as a liar or not getting it back and knowing i maintained my honor, i would choose to stay off the game. As i told the gm that night &quot;i refuse to lower my standards to give you a false answer. It would be easy for me to deny my heritage, but i will not.&quot;<br>
<br>
So i shall say goodbye again, and thank you all for listening.<br>
