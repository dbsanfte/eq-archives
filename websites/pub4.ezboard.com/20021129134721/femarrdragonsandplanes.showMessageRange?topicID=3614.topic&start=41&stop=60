<br>
I wouldn't buy some bullshit saying it's just some groups interpretation of the bible as they basically took the bible, in it's whole, and translated it into words that we live by today. The King James is archaic English to say the least. But they studied that too for this one.<br>
<br>
It is for lack of a better word, Bible for dummies.<br>
<br>
Now since this is getting dragged on and beat like the dead horse it is. Here's another verse.<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Corinthians 6:9<br>
<br>
Do you not know that the wicked will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be decievd; Neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters nor adulterers nor male prostitues nor homosexual offenders.<br>
<br>
That's pretty @#%$ obvious you aren't a Christian in God's eyes. <br>
<br>
Basically, declaring yourself a gay Christian is like saying I'm the president. I believe it, you can support me and believe it. But we all know it's not true. Same case.<br>
<br>
Many interpretations of the bible. Jesus, how many people will look at a verse that says, homosexuality = evil, and say, well you don't know that is what it really means.<br>
<br>
@#%$ off = @#%$ off<br>

<br>
If all men, are created by God.<br>
<br>
If God is omniscient, then he is aware of the character of his handiwork.<br>
<br>
Does not God bear the responsibility then for that character? Since he created it?<br>
<br>
Therefore: 'IF' a man/woman is 'homosexual', (I dont agree with that word) is not<br>
God, culpable in that orientation? Isnt the 'creation' actually blameless in that light?<br>
<br>
(I dont agree with - asexual, heterosexual, homosexual - they are all manufactured<br>
lables. Humans are simply sexual - PERIOD)<br>
<br>
The Bible was created in circa 600AD Greece. NOT Circa 36AD Palestine.<br>
It reflects all the manners and attitudes of that time. <br>

Christians can't pick and choose what parts of the bible they should live by only because the bible is &quot;out of date&quot;.<br>
<br>
If you are a 100% Christian, you have to believe 100% of the bible, otherwise as it was said in the bible, you are luke warm and God will spit you out. <br>
<br>
God let there be temptations on Earth, it started with the tree of the knowledge of Good and Evil. It was the literal tree. It was symbolism. God made man with the choice to choose between God's way, and man's way. But God couldn't creat a man with evil knowledge, he had to decide for himself. And so when Adam and Eve ate of the tree, they gained that knowledge, and because they where no longer pure, and had disobeyed God, he punished them like a father would punish his Child, and he sent them into the world to reap what they had sown.<br>
<br>
God put an @#%$ on guys and gals. It's their choice if they want something put in it. But it's not what God wants. <br>
<br>
Can't understand? Well pay close attention to this next part.<br>
<br>
If I want to live under the protective roof of my parents home, I'd damn well better follow &lt;their&gt; rules. If I disobey then they can take action against me. If I really @#%$ up seriously, they could put me out on the street.<br>
<br>
And once I did @#%$ up that bad, three weeks or so before I left for basic training. I have to thank Sarkam and his family for letting me stay with them.<br>
<br>
If you want to live under God's roof, and you sin, he'll forgive you. But if you keep sinning knowingly and willingly against what his wishes are. He'll spit you out of his mouth.<br>
<br>
Man was designed with the seed of choice. Just because it's there doesn't mean you should @#%$ it. Again I must stress, I'm talking to people that would be Christians, but knowingly go against the will of God. That goes for all those, not just the ones that are gay.<br>
<br>
Again just for Chiteng, God allowed there to be temptations and the like on the world, but if you follow the narrow path, then you can over come them.<br>
<br>
If you want to go against the written will of God, by all means go ahead. But you can't take the broad AND the narrow path at the same time. You can't eat your cake and have it too. <p><a href="http://www.twisted-tantrums.net/onemile/drug.html"><img border="0" src="http://www.twisted-tantrums.net/onemile/nothing.jpg"></a><br><font size="2"><a href="http://www.twisted-tantrums.net/onemile/drug.html">What kind of Drug Addict are you?</a> </center>

God doesn't cause harm, he will allow you to choose paths that will lead to harm because he gave us free choice, but he will never be the cause of harm. <br>
<br>
You say God has caused harm? I'd say my own father has caused harm, he whipped my butt up and down when I misbehaved. And so do many parents. Does that mean my parents intend to cause me harm? No it means they love me and believe that its the last resort to get me to understand the depth of my wrong-doing.<br>

How interesting?  Parents have children and they do their best to train them.  Is a parent still responsible for the actions of their children when their children are 20? 30? 50?<br>
<br>
If you say yes I hope your children never kill anyone.. cause then you should be jailed too right?<br>
<br>
Now, I concede its a bit different with God who chose the form of His creation.  Parents can't.  God, however, chose to create His "children."  With the ability to choose.  Is He responsible for their creation? Yes.  Is He responsible for the actions of His creation? No.  Options were given. <p><img src=http://www.mindspring.com/~cnjmorris/catcen.jpg>

Nope.<br>
<br>
As a religion major and former theologian-in-training, I can conclusively state that we have no extant samples of Gods' handwriting.<br>
<br>
If you look at the Bible in a 100% literal way, you will find many inconsistancies and errors.  Many of these have to do with how the Bible was formed.  No, God did not just plunk down a hefty tome and say, &quot;Been working on this for a while, take a look.&quot;  You can trace through language, archeology, and writing styles, the formation of the texts and manuscripts that formed the text that later became the Bible.<br>
<br>
More errors creep in through translations.  No biblical manuscripts were written in English, or any other commonly spoken language.  The Bible was written in Hebrew, Aramaic, Egyptian, Koine (Ancient greek, and one of my areas of study), Coptic, and a slew of other languages, then translated into Latin and Greek.  Note how most of those languages are &quot;dead&quot; languages that have not been spoken for over 1000 years, some close to 2000.<br>
<br>
Many times the best (ie oldest and presumably most authentic) text we have is a translation of a translation.  If you have ever translated anything from another language, you know inherently there are some pitfalls due to idioms, metaphors, even units of measure.  Heck, even in this modern time I will say Mars Lander...English-Metric.  Get the picture?<br>
<br>
One example of the translation difficulties that many of us have been exposed to are The Canterbury Tales.  These were written about 700 years ago...in English.  Allow me to quote: The General Prologue (in Middle English)<br>
<br>
1: Whan that aprill with his shoures soote <br>
2: The droghte of march hath perced to the roote, <br>
3: And bathed every veyne in swich licour <br>
4: Of which vertu engendred is the flour; <br>
5: Whan zephirus eek with his sweete breeth <br>
6: Inspired hath in every holt and heeth <br>
7: Tendre croppes, and the yonge sonne <br>
8: Hath in the ram his halve cours yronne, <br>
9: And smale foweles maken melodye, <br>
10: That slepen al the nyght with open ye <br>
11: (so priketh hem nature in hir corages); <br>
12: Thanne longen folk to goon on pilgrimages, <br>
13: And palmeres for to seken straunge strondes, <br>
14: To ferne halwes, kowthe in sondry londes; <br>
15: And specially from every shires ende <br>
16: Of engelond to caunterbury they wende, <br>
17: The hooly blisful martir for to seke, <br>
18: That hem hath holpen whan that they were seeke. <br>
19: Bifil that in that seson on a day, <br>
20: In southwerk at the tabard as I lay <br>
21: Redy to wenden on my pilgrymage <br>
22: To caunterbury with ful devout corage, <br>
23: At nyght was come into that hostelrye <br>
24: Wel nyne and twenty in a compaignye, <br>
<br>
This is your native language, as written a mere 700 years ago.<br>
<br>
<br>
Amplify this by hundreds, or thousands of years, (parts of the Old Testament are thought to date back 7000 years) and many (dead) languages, and you will begin to see the magnitude of what biblical scholars/translators have to face.  No matter how painstaking and loving work went into any modern translation, there will be errors, and disagreements of translations.  This is why there are so many versions out there.<br>
<br>
Additionally, there is some disagreement as to that books actually make up the canonical version of the Bible.  Ever read the Gospel of Thomas?  Maccabees?  Bel and the Dragon?  If you are Protestant, probably not.  But these are considered canonical, or at least apocrypha in some versions of Christianity.<br>
<br>
In summary, you can believe that the Bible was divinely *inspired*.  You have every right to think that it is the Word of God sent down to man, and written by man.  But unless you have mastered many languages, and have access to the actual fragments and texts, you cannot believe that the English translation is exactly word-for-word what God said to us, and written down by Him.  His Word is perfect, but we humans will always make errors, no matter how hard we try.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
PS.  If you have not read The Gospel of Thomas, I highly recomend you do so.  I find it a very clean, very good Gospel that should have been canon.<br>

Were I to code a virus, for my own use, and no one elses. Let us suppose<br>
I coded a REALLY nasty and malefic nature. Lets say that it flashes a blank bios.<br>
That would destroy most unprotected cpu. Who is responsible for the existance<br>
of that virus? The person that created it. That is certainly the view of the LAW,<br>
but then the LAW is a human construct.<br>
<br>
If the virus were to get out and damage something, whos fault would that be?<br>
The Virus's fault? The creator's fault? Or, The person who let it escape?<br>
<br>
Is using the words 'free will' the same as saying 'not responsible'?<br>
Does man, actually have 'free will'? In all things and in all ways?<br>
If you look at DNA as a type of program, it starts looking very deterministic.<br>
So much so that I am no longer willing to make that evaluation so easily.<br>
In fact, on the sub-atomic level, all things are pre-determined. Or are they?<br>

God created humans to be neutral, in the middle, he &quot;hoped&quot; they would do good. But he gave them the CHOICE&lt;&lt; to do evil. And the evil goes against God. But he did give you the choice.<br>
<br>
A @#%$ virus isn't a thinking machine, it can't decide wether or not it's actions are good or evil, because it does only what you told it to do. What the fu ck is going on in your head to say that human kind can be compared to a virus that blindy destroys computers just because that's all it knows how to do. Humanity is on a far greater level of sentience. I can't believe you couldn't even READ the SIMPLE SIMPLE&lt; GOD DAMN SIMPLE analogy I used to define it!! <br>
<br>
And is being homosexual wicked? To a Christian it is supposed to be. That doesn't mean everyone. So non-Christian homosexuals have nothing to worry about. It's the ones that follow the word of God and claim they do that are wrong imo.<br>
<br>
And Grammaw. Who gives two shits and a @#%$ besides people that aren't born again gospel filled Christians? If you ARE a Christian, you won't question that the bible is God's word. To follow the God damn religion means you believe in the @#%$.<br>

You can't be an a mormon saying that the koran isn't to be taken literaly because it's just an old book.<br>

This is religion we're talking about people, it's not a rational thing! RELIGION is not so simple to explain as what you say. If you aren't a Christian, then point out all the flaws you want to in the Bible, but if you ARE a Chrisitian!! and you don't believe what the Bible says then I would spit on you for your lack of faith in your faith.<br>

<br>
My whole post was to hopefully make you understand that if you believe that the Bible is the Word of God, have to understand that due to translations, different versions etc, you cannot take things extremely literally.  Your Bible and mine will simply say things differently!  <br>
<br>
Siilverain had an excellent post in your other thread, where she pasted a passage from a few different translations.  All could be taken slightly differently.  None were identical.  So which one is right?<br>
<br>
Actually, they all are, but you *have* to account for differences in manuscripts used, and translations.  Since all bibles will word things differently, how can you take it all literally?<br>
<br>
Additionally, understanding the context of the historical world in which they were written helps you to understand the meaning.<br>
<br>
Case in point:  Sodom and homosexuality.  In the Hebrew, there is quite a bit of evidence that it was not homosexuality that made God upset.  Rather it was inhospitality to his angels, and the threat of homosexual *rape* that is the sin.  it all really hinges on the Hebrew word for &quot;Know&quot;.  Biblically, the word is used like we would use it.  &quot;I know this person, he is a good fellow.&quot;  It is also used as a euphamism for sleeping with someone.  Hence the phrase &quot;Knowing them biblically.&quot;  Big debates are centered around this usage of the word.<br>
<br>
Now, looking at historical contexts.  Up until fairly recently, the mechanism of pregnancy was misunderstood.  It was commonly believed that men had all the makings of children contained in thier semen.  It was believed that all a man needed was a fertile place for the semen to grow into a baby.  A woman's womb was this place.  But the woman had no real part in procreation, other than providing a place for the semen to mature.  If the semen did not develop into a child, the womb was at fault, not the semen.  Thus, you hear about barren women, but never barren men.<br>
<br>
Knowing this fact, that semen and *only* semen was the life-force needed to procreate, and you begin to understand how it was considered holy, and precious.  Thus, we have prohibitions about masterbation (reference Onan spilling his seed) and even wet dreams (if semen was spilled, anything it contacted was considered unclean, because essentially, dead babies covered it).  It is logical then that since a man had no womb, wasting semen with another man would be a sin.  Not because of the act, but because of (as was believed) all the dead babies.  Note, you will not find any prohibitions about female homosexuality.  Why, no semen was wasted.<br>
<br>
Take this literally.  From the NIV translation.<br>
Exodus 20:3 &quot;You shall have no other gods before me. <br>
<br>
Look at this passage again.  This is a direct quote from Him. Not only is it in His Word, but He is speaking this line.  This does not say there are no other gods.  It does not say you cannot worship other gods.  It says as long as you worship Him first, the rest of your pantheon is up to you.  <br>
<br>
So it is ok to worship other gods, as long as you put the Judao-Christian God first.  Taken literally, you can put a Buddha, a pagan tree spirit, and a velvet Elvis all on your church's altar and worship them.  As long as you pay the most homage to Yahveh, its all good.<br>
<br>
<br>
Please Elnots, before you try and argue the Bible, make sure you understand it.<br>
Reading the Bible very literally will only lead to grief, since there are so many inconsistancies taken that way.  Once you have understanding that it is a living book, but filtered down through many languages and interpretations, can you really appreciate its true meaning.<br>

Taken literally couldn't you also assume that He meant "before" Him as in "in His presence".<br>
<br>
Just as my mother placed my meal "before" me.  Just as we come "before" Him in prayer.  Couldn't it mean that God, as an all present being, could have meant others gods should not be present in your life? In your relationship with Him?<br>
<br>
Would have to go to a language I don't know to assertain the implied meaning, but strictly literally - can you see where I am coming from on this?<br>
