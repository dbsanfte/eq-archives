<br>
Re: Wow<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
 Divine, not Devine.<br>
Guess what? I'm actually going to answer your questions. I knew that BA in Religion &amp; Biblical Literature had to come in handy sometime.<br>
<br>
1) God flooded the world and only saved Noah and his family. So, after the flood was over, was there mass inbreeding? Or did god just start making more people out of clay? The Bible never mentions things of this nature.<br>
<br>
Noah's three sons all went to different parts of the world with their families. There they found people who had not been flooded. This is confusing, yes, since God is supposed to have flooded the world. As a scholar, I say that what the Bible means is God flooded Noah's world.<br>
<br>
-----------------------------------------<br>
<br>
The part after you state you are a scholar I get, but the first part, about the son's scattering I do not.  Is this not mere theory?  If they did leave, did they maybe move only a short distance?  Seems like a guesstimate (yeah, my word)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
=============================================<br>
<br>
2) Why was Lylith (Adam's first wife) never spoken of after she left Adam?<br>
<br>
First of all, the name Lilith is not in the Bible. The first creation story says that God created man and woman together -- but doesn't name them. The second one involves Adam's rib and names Adam and Eve. Lilith is a story Rabbis made up to explain the contradiction. And Lilith didn't leave Adam; God sent her away at Adam's request. Adam was pissed because Lilith wanted to be on top during sex. Supposedly, she is now a demon who sucks out the souls of newborns.<br>
==============================================<br>
Agreed mostly.  She was a tool made up to back up certain theories, most certainly written after the initial writings in the old testament.<br>
<br>
<br>
--------------------------------------------------------<br>
3) In the book of Genesis, God refers to himself as &quot;we&quot; and &quot;us&quot; : &quot;We can not let them eat from the fruit of life or they will become like us.&quot; Does God have Multiple Personality Disorder? Are we looking at a case of Gods and Demi Gods?<br>
<br>
Kings and Queens are entitled to refer to themselves as &quot;we.&quot; God is the King of Heaven. Why shouldn't He say &quot;We?&quot; Then there is the fact that God is Three in One and One in Three -- the Trinity. Just because Jesus was not yet incarnated in Genesis doesn't mean He wasn't around, and the Holy Spirit surely was. That's another reason for &quot;We&quot; and &quot;Us.&quot;<br>
------------------------------------------------------<br>
But then are we to assume that the writer, who was most certainly not Him, was quoting God?  Was he making this up?  Was he quoting an angel or demi god.  Your theory has merit, but leaves me wondering still.<br>
<br>
==============================================<br>
<br>
4) Cain was &quot;marked&quot; and sent off, but again, never spoken of afterward.<br>
<br>
This isn't a question.<br>
-----------------------------------------------------------<br>
Assuming it is, Where was he sent to?  Why did he go?  Why did he not fight the ejection?  what was the Mark?  Why was he never mentioned again?<br>
<br>
============================================<br>
<br>
5) After the exile of Adam and Eve, the Bible speaks of Adam living for 900 years (or so), as it follows Adam's liniage, it finalizes with God saying that &quot;they are too much like us.&quot; At which point God shortens Man's lifespan to 80 years. And people say smoking cuts your life short... sheesh.<br>
<br>
This one's not a question, either.<br>
-----------------------------------------------------------<br>
Again, let's rephrase it as a question.<br>
How do you explain the quote?  How do you explain that they are too much like Him?  How do we explain the reduced lifespan?<br>
<br>
==========================================<br>
<br>
6) After the exile of our fine young couple. The bible begins to speak of other people. Again, did god just start manufacturing people out of clay? The bible didn't mention where they came from. Just suddenly POOF, we got surrounded.<br>
<br>
Adam and Eve were offered Eden. God's other creations were not. That's not hard to understand, is it?<br>
---------------------------------------------------------<br>
Actually, i think it is quite hard, as several concepts are not adequately answered.  Why the sudden mentioning of others?  Why the previous silence on the others?  Why were the others not offered Eden?  I must be missing something..??!!<br>
<br>
=============================================<br>
7) The Bible never speaks of Jesus's childhood, did he have his wet dreams? Was he ever caught off in the stables jerking off like the other boys? Inquiring minds want to know.<br>
<br>
In fact, there _are_ a few mentions of his childhood, such as debating with the Holy Men in the Temple and impressing them (this is probably why Jesus was trained as a Rabbi). Of course, as Kevin Smith points out in Dogma, it would presumably take a long time to accept that one is the Son of God!<br>
Ooh, Jesus jerking off, how shocking! Like no one has asked this before. Now, since Jesus was both Human and Divine, he quite possibly had normal adolescent Human urges. Whether or not he acted on them, I don't presume to speculate.<br>
------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
I kinda like that one.  No dispute.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
<br>
So, I hope that clears up a few things for you.<br>

<br>
Nope, not a theory; the Bible states that they scattered.  For example, Ham, Noah's second son, went to Africa -- from Mt. Ararat, where the ark landed.<br>
<br>
[quote]But then are we to assume that the writer, who was most certainly not Him, was quoting God? Was he making this up? Was he quoting an angel or demi god. Your theory has merit, but leaves me wondering still.[/quote]<br>
<br>
No assumption necessary.  Yes, the Deuteronomic Scholars, who were the first to record these stories, were quoting God.  The remarks are even in quotes.  Now, in Christian doctrine, it was Metatron (a seraphim) who did the actual speaking.  Since the human system cannot handle God's actual Voice; Metatron does the speaking for Him.<br>
<br>
[quote]Assuming it is [a question], Where was he sent to? Why did he go? Why did he not fight the ejection? what was the Mark? Why was he never mentioned again?[/quote]<br>
<br>
1. Where, I do not know.  The Bible simply says, "away."  Out of the sight of God.<br>
2. God, the Almighty, made him go.  His parents didn't banish him, God did.  Would you want to defy God?  Even after their expulsion from Eden, Adam and Eve maintained a close relationship with God; Cain knew how powerful God is!<br>
3. Cain knew he had done wrong -- he was the first murderer.  He regretted his action, and knew he deserved to be sent away.<br>
4. No one knows what the Mark was, although there are many theories, from an infirmity or deformity, to the curse of vampirism.  The Bible does not say.<br>
5. He was a bad person, and God had rejected him.  After he murders Abel, Cain is no longer important -- and he was gone.  There is no need to mention him.  The Bible rarely mentions bad people, except to describe their sticky end at the hands of God or the Jews.<br>
<br>
[quote]How do you explain the quote? How do you explain that they are too much like Him? How do we explain the reduced lifespan?[/quote]<br>
<br>
Explain it?  I don't.  I also don't really believe that Adam lived for 900 years.  As for "too much like us," God seems to have a complex about humans being too much like Him in Hebrew Scripture (Old Testament).  For example, Adam and Eve eat from the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil, and learn things they didn't know (i.e. that they are naked), and God expels them for this.  He feels they are now too much like Him.  God might have been punishing humans -- I believe that he cut the lifespan of humans at a time when the Jews were (once again) betraying Him.<br>
<br>
[quote]Actually, i think it is quite hard, as several concepts are not adequately answered. Why the sudden mentioning of others? Why the previous silence on the others? Why were the others not offered Eden? I must be missing something..??!![/quote]<br>
<br>
1. The others are mentioned when Adam and Eve leave the Garden of Eden.  They weren't in the Garden, and Adam and Eve did not know they existed, so the mention really isn't all that sudden.  <br>
2. The fact that the others were not in Eden also explains the "previous silence" (I like that phrase).  <br>
3. As for why the others were not offered Eden, I don't know, however, I do have a theory.  It could be because they worshipped other gods.  Many people think that Jews believe in the existence of only one god.  That's not quite true.  Jews believe only one god -- Yahweh -- should be _worshipped_, but allow for the existence of other gods.  Worship Yahweh, have a chance at Eden.  Worship someone else, get what they offer -- this world.  (Side note: if there weren't other gods, why would God admonish the Jews to have "no other gods before me"?  Just food for thought; I only believe in One God.)<br>
<br>
[quote]And again, this is in NO WAY to be considered hostile or an attack, just a healthy discussion.[/quote]<br>
<br>
No fear, I understood that.  I like people who push my thinking.  I hope my answers are adequate; I only have a BA, no graduate degree.  I imagine and hope they have generated further questions on your part.  However, I suggest that rather than posting them here, you e-mail me at Simonnester@yahoo.com -- I'll be glad to asnwer them, but I don't want to drag this thread out just for the two of us!
