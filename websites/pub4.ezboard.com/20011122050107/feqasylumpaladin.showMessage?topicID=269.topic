Why must we default the book every week??<br>
<br>
I've tried to get a shot at leading a naggy-raid for ages now, but somehow I always get to the calendar when it's already reserved for another week.. <br>
<br>
I just think it's lame to default the book. Damn, why don't we make a set of rules (maybe let lvl 51-52 roll on it??) and take this beast down together instead of defaulting it all the time.. Yes, I know we all want our epics, but as things are turning now, I am just getting sick everytime I read about naggy-raids.. I don't even bother going to them anymore actually.. <br>

Ill tell you what I AM opposed to is reaching 52 and knowing I cant go to 53 till i get my 2 books.. so forgive me in being proactive and undertaking the leadership role in a raid so that I can move on... aint gonna get my epic from sitting back and watching others lead raids.<br>
<br>
sorry.. kind of a rant, but pisses me off when people bitch about stuff being defaulted.. dont go, schedule your own raid, its not that hard......<br>
And ive been on my fair share of raids.. most of the time the book hasnt been defaulted, and when it is... go anyway.. 2 books can drop.. its happened. <br>
btw, leading a raid with a goal of a piece for your epic isnt greed.. theres lots of drops off of naggy.. when was the last time you asked a rogue to roll on his piece off of the general... but thats not greedy..... <br>

<br>
- I believe in the calendarsystem. Reason for that: easy way to handle situations which otherwise most likely will lead to hard feelings between players and alot of rants, bitching on this board and so on.<br>
<br>
- Defaulting. Yes, Ferok, there is one other way to get those books and that is to kill the Kunark dragons. Of course it's alot harder than to charge naggy and vox, but it can be done. The problem with this is that many paladins (including myself) get stuck on lvl 52 in order to get the books. As I've stated in another post I still think it's wrong to default an epic-drop from such an easy kill as naggy. This is the reason that I would never attend a naggy-raid when the book is defaulted (even though I could win a CoF)<br>
<br>
And since I strongly believe in the calendarsystem it gets very hard to even get a shot at reserving a time for naggy, due to all &quot;calendarcampers&quot;.  <p><center><bold>Bolor Tuppameister </bold><br>

<br>
Bolor I agree with you 100%.  It was so disheartening to see what people turned into over this pathetic drop that I have stopped playing my paladin out of sheer embarassment. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I used to think it was such a noble, honorable class to play, but after my first few raids on naggy/vox I realized how greedy some people can be.  <br>
<br>
Even went so far as to start another character to kill the time inbetween raids so I didn't pass 52 with my paladin.  Well as you can see by my info below, my new alt is about to hit 52 as well.  Thats how long its been with a defaulted raid every week since I started trying.  All the experience my paladin got after 47 was purely from raids to kill time.  <br>
<br>
No offense Ferok but having each person that needs the book host their own raid is probably the reason they have failed and been disasters the last couple of months.  Not everyone is cut out to lead a raid, I know I'm not so I wont attempt to torture a lot of hopeful people or get in a camp fest over the calendar.  <br>

If you want the book feel free to host a raid and default it to you even if one posted for the same day. Of course some people might hate you for that but its part of the game.<br>
<br>
If you say that you can't host a raid by yourself then ask your guild/friends to help you. I wouldnt host a raid myself cause I suck at it. I can't keep up with all the tells due in part by the fact than English is not my native language. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/usirarris.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sir Arris</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Knight of Truth</span><br> <font color=#000033>(10/12/01 8:52:49 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Fellow holy fighters</span><hr size=1> <br>
Leading a dragon raid is no walk in the park, no matter how many times you've done it. Dealing with just about every person and his cousin asking if he can come, trying to get the people he needs, getting them to LS, getting them into balanced groups, dealing with the fuck nuts who can't stop playing with the lever on the bridge, talking to the puller &amp; main assist ... this is just the tip of the iceberg, since these are just the guarentees you have to do, not counting all the shit that pops up while you're there.<br>
<br>
Maybe one of my paladin friends who was 52 for a few months, kept leading dragon raids, kept letting every paladin roll, kept losing, and kept seeing more then half of those books go to waste because they either rotted in the bank, the paladin quit, or he was a twink that really didn't care. That sorta grates on your nerves.<br>
<br>
Fair isn't getting an outright equal chance. Yes, you both killed the dragon. Yes, you both risked the same experience and such. However, if you're not leading, you're not putting as much time or work into the raid as someone who is. People think it's just show up, make the groups, and kill a dragon, right? I wish it was that easy.<br>
<br>
That's one of the perks of being a raid leader. You get to decide the loot rules. And if some of the paladins don't want to come because they won't be getting their free ride (which is what attending an open dragon raid is for someone who isn't leading - a free ride), oh well. <p><center>

Thinking back, I am now working all the time, spending time with the kids, working on a book, etc... and have very little time for EQ.  I love the game but staying in level 52 for 6 months when I had the time to play was foolish. I regret it!<br>
<br>
My suggestion is to go on as many open(No book default) raids as you can until you get to level 53.  THEN you should move on. <br>
<br>
If you wait, you will miss out on many fun adventures that you could have in EQ.  You will not get to goof of in exp groups cracking jokes and slamming your SK groupers <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  . There is lots of fun to be had raiding and grouping with friends. <br>
<br>
I guess I am rambling but the point is....  You don't know how much longer you can play this game.  You don't know when you will get a promotion at work that will keep you from EQ.  School may start to suffer and you may have to lay off the game.  There are many factors, but if you have time to play EQ now..... you should play and level and have fun.<br>

<br>
Here is what you said...<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> &quot;sorry.. kind of a rant, but pisses me off when people bitch about stuff being defaulted.. dont go, schedule your own raid, its not that hard......&quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <br>
<br>
My response was....<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> &quot;No offense Ferok but having each person that needs the book host their own raid is probably the reason they have failed and been disasters the last couple of months&quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
What I mean by that is this...sounds like an open invitation for everyone on the server to host a raid. My reaction to that is *scream*, OMG run.  Wasn't saying that Ferok has a lack of leadership skill and his raids have been failures.  I have never been on one of your raids, nor am I aware of any of their successes or failures so I have no basis on which to form any opinion of your leadership abilities. <br>
<br>
I'm sorry if my previous statement caused some confusion, I was just a little nervous of the thought of encouraging every person in need to run out there and host a raid. That quite honestly scares the shit out of me.  If you can handle it and feel comfortable doing so, thats wonderful, but dont assume everyone else can. <br>
<br>
Doesn't make much sense to praise Arris and agree with his post about just how stressful and hard it can be to host a raid.  At the same time your telling everyone to run out and do it because its not that hard.  Shrug, just my .02 cents worth, and mostly why I always just keep my mouth shut...so my foot stays out of it. <br>

Leading a raid is, yes, difficult... well said by arris.  Its not difficult in the sence that it requires talent or skill or anything of that nature, anyone can lead a raid, provided they have experience raiding in that place.  However leading a raid is stressful.  It requires patience, perserverance, patience and most of all patience.  <br>
<br>
The reason i praised what arris said is because people take raid leadership for granted, and believe that the leader should not be rewarded for what he/she goes thru.  Here arrises this concept that if you lead a raid with the sole purpose of getting an epic piece you are now a dirty greedy bastard... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/udeladar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Deladar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>w4nn4b3!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(10/15/01 9:24:49 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Fellow holy fighters</span><hr size=1> I dunno about this one...<br>
<br>
I guess back when I did Naggy/Vox raids the books weren't defaulting.  Some of the raids were starting to do that, but I just never went on them.  Mainly because I didn't have the time to put in on a f00king Naggy/Vox raid, for the miniscule chance that not only will one book drop, but a second one as well.<br>
<br>
You shouldn't let your game be held up by the epic.  Go on as many raids as you can until 53 then try to get into Kunark dragon raids.  The nice thing about these raids is there's usually only 1 or 2 paladins on them and one will probably have his epic already.  Grats paladin_02 on defaulted book.<br>
<br>
I'm astonished at the amount of time Naggy/Vox raids take just to kill a single mob.  I still remember being on a 5 hour Vox raid, and that was <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>   without</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> a wipeout.  Talendar and Severilious take about 60-90 minutes tops.  Most of that's assembling/buffing time.  (Got my burnt book off Talendar)<br>
<br>
I guess what I'm saying is Naggy and Vox suck anyways.  I'd prolly hit the Vox raids way more than Naggy before 53 because Gorenaire is almost never taken down now.<br>
<br>
As far as the paladins seemingly being greedy, it's more than likely &quot;epic-fever.&quot;  Epics are f00king evil, but I sure like mine.  =)<br>
