Has EQ made you hard or were you always an asshole?  (dont even answer that :P )<br>
<br>
What she did is Wrong.<br>
What she Tried to do is wrong.<br>
How she acts Wrong.<br>
and How she gropes for anyone to &quot;love or like her&quot; I see not as wrong but as some pretty lonely kid.  Did you have a picture perfect childhood?  How many of you were abused in one way or another, How many are ousted for being &quot;less intelligent&quot; &quot;needy&quot; or &quot;annoying&quot;   How about different?  Lonely?  <br>
<br>
My two cents.<br>
<br>
One is you DO need Help Bloop3r, but I suggest you seek it at your school's counselor.  Something doesn't sit right with me and If I am even close to the mark, you need to Admit it to someone who is able to change your situation and do it NOW. Don't let anyone tell you that something you DONT do, is your fault, and you have a right to be treated like a kid, and a human being as well.<br>
<br>
*could i be off the mark? Could I be wrong?  I'd rather be wrong than be right, but I am NOT taking that chance...the consequences would be too great in any situation /shrug  Some of you dont give a shit about anyone but you, and if it doesnt affect you in real life or personally, you don't really give a shit.  I am not, so do us all a favor and bite your tongue instead of continuing this Post on with Flames and stupidity.*   While you are at it, lock the post, I dont see any reason for it to be open.<br>
<br>

Anyways I do not know you so if you say you are ghetto then you might be.  But you have some serious issues because all you do on this board is look for you do not know to yell at and take you frustrations out on.  I really wish you could read your posts from someone elses point of view so you could know how truely pathetic you are.  Your comments are lame, pointless, and unprovoced.  You might not be a bad person but when I read the stuff you write, you sound like a 13year old boy trying to get attention by picking on others.<br>

<br>
This person came here in an attempt to smear the reputation of both Toronto and Seven Dreams (and yes, I know you will argue that &quot;she didn't want to give the name&quot;, but be honest, it really didn't take a whole lot of prodding).  She has no proof that it was Toronto.  She has no tangible proof other than what she said that anyone even logged onto her account.  Of course people are going to stand up and say &quot;Toronto wouldn't do that&quot;, she's attacking his character and those who know him as a kind and generous person would naturally be inclined to defend his character (and character witnesses for the defense are, by the way, admissable in a court of law).  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  <br>
She already said she logged onto a second account and saw her character logged on by someone else, for those people wondering how she acquired such knowledge.<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
I must have missed this.  Can you give me an exact location where I can find this, because all I could find was that she stated that she came back from vacation and her password didn't work.  This could be anything from mistyping to someone else changing it to a database hiccup to her account expiring if she's using a prepurchase option or her credit card expired.  I'm sorry but she doesn't even have proof that someone else is or has ever been using her account.  Nor will she until she contacts Verant to see if something else is wrong with it... not to mention that if she would just contact Verant she would get her password back and wouldn't have to continue this.<br>
<br>
[EDIT]<br>
Oh.  I see where you got this from re-reading the original post.  No, she did not state that anyone was logged into her character, she stated that Toronto was logged into his own character.  Sorry, no dice.<br>
[/EDIT]<br>
<br>
This is not like Jenae's epic at all.  There is proof that Jenae was involved in the epic thing.  There is no proof whatsoever that Toronto was involved here.<br>
<br>
Yes, there appears to be something very wrong with this person, but I highly doubt it's any fault of Toronto's.<br>

<br>
I wasn't going to argue that she didn't come here to smear anyone's name, but if you insist...you don't have anything to back up the claim that smearing Toronto's name was her original intent.<br>
<br>
I don't think you would've been happy if she kept it a secret altogether, or if it took 5 pages to get a name and guild out of her...it's only because it involved Seven Dreams and Toronto...otherwise you wouldn't have cared much at all.<br>
<br>
Of course that's only an assumption, but it seems like a safe one to me.<br>
<br>
The reference to Jenae was for all those tons of people who came to her defense, saying that she would never do such a thing, because she's not like that...not about any existing or non-existing evidence.<br>
<br>
To ask her to bring proof isn't fair either...because no one from 7D has anything substantial either.<br>
<br>
I didn't accuse him of anything...it's Xotic's claim, I haven't added or detracted from it. <br>
<br>
Either way, there's nothing that can actually solve this, because none of them seem to be able to bring for any kind of evidence to back up either of their claims, not to mention for whatever reason Toronto can't even back himself up on this thread. It can only be ignored...<br>
<br>
Of course it can't be ignored unless people ignore Xotic's situation as well...which no one seems to be capable of doing. They're bent on either verbally abusing her or making senseless, tasteless statements. Then blame it on her as if they were forced to. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :\ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":\"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uigottomuchgameforyou.showPublicProfile?language=EN>igottomuchgameforyou</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>h0x0r!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(8/18/01 7:44:39 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Sharing accounts with loved ones.</span><hr size=1> Wow guess you told me <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I will edit the post and make it say write and change you to your.

<br>
Regardless, yes, indeed, I will speak in favor of Toronto, as he is a friend, and also a guildmate, but friend foremost.  I will speak out for anyone who is accused unjustly by use of erroneous logic.  Furthermore you will note that I have several times instructed Xotic in the correct way of retrieving her account without the necessity of spreading accusations.<br>
<br>
Intent or not, accusing someone of stealing will indeed smear their name.  It is an unavoidable side-effect of an accusation of that nature.  Unfortunate but true.  <br>
<br>
No, we have no proof that Toronto didn't do it.  Nor do I have any proof that you yourself didn't steal the account.  Or heck, even proof that it wasn't me. That's why the burden of proof always rests in the hands of the accuser, because it's extremely difficult to prove that something wasn't done.  I can't prove that I didn't murder someone last night either, but that doesn't mean I did murder someone.  That line of reasoning is ridiculous.<br>
