<br>
I Liked the dialoge these topics started, however, so i will occasionally be throwing up these &quot; Enchanter Topics &quot;.  I am encouraging everyone to comment if they want to, so we can try to keep our community strong.<br>
<br>
The topic i have chosen for today is &quot; Enchanter Ego&quot;.  Lets face it.  We ALL have it.  It comes with the profession, especially at higher levels.  After you stop so many trains, hear your groups sing your praises , etc, its hard not to develop some ego.  I believe one of the keys to being a good enchanter is a belief tha &quot; i can handle this &quot;, which to many seems like ego.  What follows is some ways i find to diffuse the belief that all enchanters are full of ego, and think everyone else exsists to serve us.<br>
<br>
1) Be Mellow<br>
<br>
What i mean by this is, be calm, cool and collected, no matter WHAT the situation.  If your in an exp camp for 3 hours, and your tank breaks a mezz once and trips over himself / herself to appologize, tell them not to worry about it.  This is not the time to jump all over them.  If that pet user has been doing a great job, then has a couple bad mistakes ( where you all live anyway ), dont jump all over them.. they already feel bad.<br>
<br>
If the main tank is pulling 1-2 mobs, and you feel the need to shine ( come on, we all do ) and feel stymied, dont demand that they pull more mobs, or complain incessantly about being bored.  This doesnt get you any points with the people there, and , later on, could be the deciding factor in whether or not you get to go on that raid, or get that group over another enchanter.<br>
<br>
2) Be Flexible<br>
<br>
We all tend to like things done a certain way.  Each of us has developed our own style of being an enchanter, and doing the work.  Some of us use AoE mezz, some of us dont.  Some of us charm a lot, some dont. Many times enchanters get set in their ways and dont want / argue about doing things different ways.  One of the strengths of our class is our flexibility, and we all need to remember that. Dont let a tank tell you how to do your job, BUT, if you like to charm a lot and the tanks / clerics dont want you to, keep that under consideration for the sake of group harmony.<br>
<br>
3) Be courteous<br>
<br>
Many times others mistakes cost us our virtual life.  This can be upsetting, BUT, we can make many more friends if we attempt to brush these setbacks off.  As long as everyone KNOWS what happened wrong, and doesnt repeat mistakes, there is no need to berate people for mistakes.  I hear stories of enchanters (yes , on lanys ), who jump on everyone in their groups at the first opportunity, boss everyone around ceaselessly, and are general hard asses.  People also tell me they avoid these enchanters whenever possible, only grouping / raiding with them if there is no other option.  With the proliferation of enchanters, there generally IS another option.  Dont let this happen to you.<br>
<br>
4) Be responsible<br>
<br>
Enchanters many times end up as defacto leaders of whatever group they are in.  Recognize this, and work with the main puller ( also one of the group leaders normally ) to keep the group operate at maximum efficiency, all while attempting to be polite and courteous.  If you cant politely explain to the people of your group what you want, and if they continue to make boneheaded mistakes, it is MUCH better to simply tell them &quot; im sorry, this is not working out, i will need to disband &quot;, and do so when it is safe, rather than yelling at them for hours.<br>

<br>
I know that in the normal pick-up group situation I try to work with an enchanter to learn what their play style is (ie are these mobs mezzable or will they be charmed).  <br>
<br>
In certain dungeons (example sebillis) where I know, and everyone in the group knows, that multiple mobs will be pulled, I try to toss out Atols so that hopefully the enchanter will have an extra 2 seconds to get those adds mezzed before they start to beat all of us up.<br>
<br>
One thing that I have noticed while playing Eyly is the lack of communication among lower level players.  Often time the first time that I know that a mob has been pulled is I see the tanks health bar dropping (grr the annoying book).  Also, they tend to not listen as well as higher levels do.  An example- I was in oasis killing those dreaded orcs- enchanter is doing a kick ass job of mezzing mobs- the paladin insists on breaking mez since well we had two healers (druid and myself) might as well kill more mobs.  I believe the enchanter finally started to charm mobs just to annoy the paladin.  <br>

To be a good enchanter you have to know a lot about the nature of your enemy. It leads to a superiority complex. You have to remember to keep your ego in check. Dont forget the all important: If it doesnt need saying, dont say it. In other words dont stick your foot in your mouth. Just sit back relax and watch what is going on and do your best. <br>

<br>
Basically, the past few groups/raids  I've been on (Not to toot my own horn or anything, I'm just relating what happened), I've been asked by a couple different people why i'm different from other enchanters.<br>
<br>
"What do you mean?"  I asked back.<br>
<br>
Both times, I was told that other enchanters tend to be very much full of themselves, and that I don't appear to be this way.  Several enchanters were named, as the people in the group joked about it.  "Soandso always says this."  "Did you see the way Suchandsuch acts?  What an ego."  "Oh, then you'd never wanna group with Whatshisname."<br>
I chuckled along with them, but the truth remains that a few of these people are higher level enchanters, some of whom I've watched in action, and I couldn't help but agree that from what I've seen of some of them, even *I* thought they had a bit of an ego problem.<br>
<br>
So I was going to post a topic talking about why enchanters could possibly get a big ego - obvious enough are the reasons, as Llorian posted - the idea that you're a deciding factor whether or not the group lives most of the time - the ability to hol several high level mobs at bay - the *control* we all feel the need to have over every situation we encounter - all of these could obviously contribute to egotistical behavior (most of which is really seen in 50+ people, so that's what I'll be talking about).<br>
<br>
Although there are times when you have to be a little stern with your group - when someone iss repeatedly doing something life threateningly wrong - we have to understand that the others are players too.  They too, have leveled their characters to level 50-something (perhaps 60) and they too take not only pride in that, but also see it as a sort of license that they know what they're doing - and they don't necessarily want to be told what to do, or appreciate it when someone attempts to.  It's demeaning - you can't tell me you've never had a bit of a demeaning feeling when raiding with a higher level enchanter who puts you on "C duty" or something like that.  It's a step down from your usual spot as basically a group leader.  But you suck it up - you know that it's a job that has to be done, and you'll have your share of being the highest level enchanter and asking the lower level folks to take care of the more menial stuff so you have the mana to mez.<br>
<br>
So compare that to the next time you bitch tank who just broke a mez, or a druid who dotted, or a pet class whose pet just popped one off on the wrong mob.  It gives the impression that you feel you're above them, and can order them around, and that's probably one of the biggest reasons people think enchanters have ego problems.<br>
<br>
Another thing is that our class is a bit of a mystery to some people.  We have lots of abilities not everyone is aware of.  I had a druid friend argue with me once that his dispell was the best in the game.  It was on a Hate raid.  We were pulling the Maestro, and I said "I'll get dispells."  He said "No, I'll do it, I've got annul."  I then had to explain to him that recant was a better spell, to which he was not aware.  The same goes for some other spells, like the lull line.  People know we have it, but are unaware as to how it works.  "Daeon, can you lull this mob?"  "Huh?  I haven't memmed that spell since the day I got it and it killed me."  "Well, if it resists, keep trying."  "There's no resist message."  "Oh?"  Also, people are bit in the dark about charm tactics sometimes.  I've been in groups where I announced I was going to charm something in order to up melee damage, and the shaman slowed it while I was attempting charm.  Now I had a slowed, charmed pet.  "Ack, you slowed it."  "Yeah, figured it would make it easier on you."  "Uh.."  I mean, that practically defeats the purpose.<br>
<br>
However, you can't EXPECT people to know EVERYTHING about your class - so don't belittle them or bitch and moan just because they don't.  They may be like me and have only played one class ever.  I don't know a damn thing about any class except enchanters (and rangers, because my brother plays one) - and it probably seems like I'm asking the stupidest questions.  <br>
At level 51:  "Daeon, want tuna?"  "Huh? /ponder"<br>
Damned if I knew what the hell that was.<br>
Or the first time I encountered a necro who wanted to use their lich ability over a clarity-type spell.  This was at level, uh..  prolly 26 or so, since Breeze (Kunark) came out right before I got clarity... hehe - the guy literally YELLED at me because I hit him with Breeze.  I had no idea what the hell his problem was.  Why would any caster not want a mana regen spell?   Oh, necros get their own?  Really?  Wow.  I felt like such an ass.<br>
Instead of being an ass about it and making the other person feel like crap, politely explain the item in question. <br>
<br>
Why do people think I'm different?  I dunno.  I asked them how exactly I was different, and was told that I just don't come across as thinking I'm a know-it-all and acting like it's my way or the highway compared to the other enchanters they were kidding about.  I do strictly follow what I stated above - I've never yelled at anyone for a mistake, or getting me killed, or not knowing how a particular spell/aspect of my class worked.  I don't yell at groups, or tell people what to do or how to play.  They pull, they kill, I mez.  Simple as that.  If things aren't working so well, I'll /sigh a bit, and politely ask that the problem be fixed.<br>
<br>
Pet causing problems?<br>
Nice:Pet please.<br>
Mean:  Control the damned pet or kill it, Soandso!<br>
<br>
Someone breaking mez?<br>
Nice:  Assist please.<br>
Mean:  ASSIST NOW.  Soandso isn't ASSISTING.  Press your /ASSIST Hotkey, SOANDSO!<br>
<br>
There's really no reason to go running around yelling and singling people out.  Believe me, they'll get the idea when you ask for everyone to assist/reassist nicely, just as much as if you yelled and pointed at them.<br>
<br>
So, in closing  - views on enchanter egos stem from other people not really understanding how we work, as well as from our own actions in raids or groups.  To get more people to like you and less people to think you're an egotistical jerk, speak softy, but carry a big stick.  Preferably a Rod of Insidious Glamour or a Staff of the Serpent.  ;)<br>

Well, a few comments:<br>
<br>
First off, I don't mind an enchanter with ego... hell, they all have it in some form <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  But if an enchanter is going off all the time boasting about how he can handle a 15 mob train no problem, I am sure as hell going to come down hard on him if he fails when the shit really does hit the fan. In that case, he's asking for it. Boasting is asking for trouble if you make a mistake. Nothing wrong with self confidence, but it can go too far. now on to specific points.<br>
<br>
1) I don't mind if you ask me to pull more mobs at once cause you're bored, it is so rare that I am able to find a good enchanter for my groups that frankly, I am not used to being able to pull freely. Pulling singles is so much reflex I have to work to get around it. Of course, some places will take care of this nicely due to mob levels making single pulls by me impossible, but in a dungeon like Karnors an enchanter in my group will probably end up very, very bored if he doesn't say something to me about pulling more at once. Thats the result of only having an enchanter/bard in about 10% of your groups, you end up being careful by default. If you're FM and bored, tell me, i'll pull morea t once. Having a few mobs lined up is also a faster way of getting exp, as you spend some time that would otherwise be spent on pulling for killing instead. However, I also most likely won't stop pulling cause an enchanter is low on mana,, if it is in a dungeon I can single pull. Then i'll just get singles until (s)he is good to go again <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
2) Yep, right on. AoE mez is something I rarely see used, but also something that tends to save groups from certain death when nothing else could have worked. Here keep in mind that a ranger or druid can be of great help when switching from AoE mez to single target mez, since these classes have a root line which will both root the target and do a small amount of damage breaking the AoE mez on a single mob, thereby letting you stick the single target mez on it with no risk of getting smacked down. For me personally, charm is a perfectly valid tactic. More damage = good. But goddamnit make sure you inform the group when something is chamed. Charm is awesome, but the group needs to know you've done it. And if you're going to haste your charmed pet, make sure to inform the group and especially the cleric of that too, or that group will be enchanterless real fast when charm breaks. Charmed hasted pet = awesome, but dead enchanter with a hasted mob on the loose= very bad. A role some enchanters seem to have a hard time getting out of is slowing... Please, if the cleric is at full mana and you're at 30%, don't slow mobs. Let the cleric spend some of the mana he has so much of, and save your own. And if the cleric is low and you're near full, slow them all. Always work with the cleric/other healer to determine whether to slow or not, don't just slow everything because you're used to. The group will be a lot more effective that way. (Not meaning to tell anyone here how to play their class, but this particular issue bothers me. A lot. Too many just don't understand that slowing is not always good).<br>
<br>
3) Yep, some of us want a good enchanter and not just an enchanter, and that reduces the choices considerably. I would rather do without than have an enchanter in the group I can't count on, or who does nothing but complain about small things. So I broke mez easrly once in 3 hours of grouping? Cope with it. There may be quite a lot of enchanter on Lanys by now, but I can count more bad ones that good ones that i've grouped with. and i've grouped with a lot. More often than not I am unable to find a good enchanter when putting together a group.<br>
<br>
4) Yep. Enchanter/bard generally determines the speed at which the group operates, while the puller is generally responsible for moving the group around and for picking the fights. Main assist tank is just a mindless pawn <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  (j/k on that)<br>
<br>
And in closing, just one thing for all you enchanters... Get to 60 so you can give me VoG dammit <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Shissar sucks, Wonderous Rapidity sucks, VoG rules!

Anyhow uh, yeah, what Vaine said, let me know if I'm being like that (NOT you daeon :P).  I tend to come down really hard on peeps when leading a raid or being the main enchanter on a raid, because wipeouts SUCK and they REALLY SUCK when it's due to some careless mistake by someone. <p><img src="http://alundraadjani.com/otherstuff/eq/sig3.jpg" alt="Adjani Tristesse, Goddess of Lanys"></img>

<br>
I agree with you entirely Fae; any enchanter or aspiring enchanter should definitely give this post a read.<br>
<br>
Control freak though I may be, I've always tried to be courteous, respectful, and the best enchanter that I can be for my group.<br>
<br>
Incidentally, if you're grouped with me and I'm being a pretentious prima donna, *please* tell me. It may seem that way between my spams of &quot;Ilis knight next, please,&quot; but I'm just trying to let everyone know what will let me contribute the most to the group. The last thing I want to do is ruin anyone's fun or step on her playstyle's feet.<br>
<br>
Conversely, telling me (or any enchanter) &quot;Don't charm. I don't like it&quot; (or randomly criticizing any particular thing we're doing) isn't going to make me want to group with you often. Explaining *why* you don't like something your enchanter is doing and/or trying to work for a compromise will not only have better results, but it might teach us something as well. Just because we're control freaks doesn't mean that we won't listen. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
That said, thanks to all of the *great* players of Lanys who make us enchanters look good. Knowing that your Remedy, slow, /assist, twitch, snare, taunt, etc. etc. etc. will be there is what lets us do our job. And while the enchanter often gets the praise, it's usually the rest of the group that deserves it.<br>

  I dont jump all over anyone for breaking mez, the first 2 times.  After that I send a personal tell explaining how to make a hot key for assist. Pretty sad after you get into your 40's but a fact of life.  If they refuse to create a key and continue to break mez, I send a tell to the leader.  If after that nothing is done, I make excuses and leave the group.  I don't think I've EVER screamed at anyone for getting me killed.  Matter of fact I usually blame myself, as I know I have alot to learn still.<br>
  I gotta tell you though, the bane in my enchanter life is shaman pets.  I just cringe when I get a group that has a shaman that insists on using one.<br>
  I think the main problem with most enchanter attitudes is you have to go into this character thinking &quot;Ok I'm going to die alot, am I ok with that?&quot;<br>
