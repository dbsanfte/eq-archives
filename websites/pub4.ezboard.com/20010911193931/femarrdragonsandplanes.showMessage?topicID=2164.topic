<br>
It's a new spell, minr version at 29, greater version at 60, it does no combat damage, but it somehow is the &quot;defining trait&quot; of a wizard, when the new expansion comes out. <br>
<br>
What good is a pet that just freaking sits there and does horse shit besides taking up space?<br>
<br>
And guess what!! There's gonna BE ANOTHER UPGRADE to O'KEILS!! Since we all love okiels so god damn much, VI decided to throw in ANOTHER upgrade!!  And guess what?? This one's a lvl 12 upgrade, that does 3 damage!! WOOTNESS!! <br>
<br>
This is Verants idea of giving the wizards new goodies when Luclin comes out. Hurray... By the good grace of god hurray..<br>
<br>
Watch as rangers get some ac buff that makes them warrior compatible, or cleric's get a heal spell that takes less than a second to cast. Things that can save groups.. While wizards get a 3 damage &quot;upgrade&quot; to okiels at 12, and a pet that follows us around, but won't attack, won't defend, won't take hit's. Just follows us..<br>
<br>
Once again, I'd like to express my hatred towards the wonderufly fucked up minds at Verant. I wouldn't let the cock munchers kiss my ass, they aren't good enough for that. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ulithahntalon.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lith Ahntalon</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/image/globalBlack.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 123<br> <font color=#E9D756>(7/21/01 1:45:36 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Wizard's new spell Summon Familiar</span><hr size=1> Hehe I would not count on clerics getting any real heal upgrades.

<br>
It's a common thing that we've seen everyday in EQ. Nobody wanting to be chanters??  give em breeze to give them an incentive to start new characters as enchanters and make almost every major dungeon post 50 require 20 of them. Once again class needed.<br>
<br>
Give wizards new spells at the lower levels and more people are inclined to play them if theyre new to the game.<br>
<br>
But Verant are missing two simple facts. If it works giving Wizards, Paladins, Necro's and others better spells earlier and not balancing them for the end game means instead of 20 members of unwanted classes looking for a group you have 60 instead.<br>
<br>
And the other thing is that I think Verant are naive if they think their will be a massive influx of new players with Luclin. I can see it now :<br>

<br>
In many fantasy novels, the wizard's familiar acts as the wizard's focus, to give the wizard's mental energy a concentrated output to enhance their casting abilities. If Verant sticks to this plan (They are not <b>that</b> stupid to give wizards a neat little pet that does nothing) then the familiar WILL BE the wizards defining trait.<br>
<br>
How would you like to be able to summon a pet. A pet that simply sticks to your side, neither attacking nor being attacked. However, suddenly your spells cost less mana, cast faster, hit harder, and resist less? *That* will be what familiars will (should?) do. <br>
<br>
Elnots, I've known you for a long time, and been friends ever since we met in Oasis with Feyanna. But I've got to say, the only posts I've been seeing you write on these boards are rants about VI's attempt to "placate wizards" by "throwing them a bone". Jesus fucking Christ, man, what is going to make you happy? If these familiars work as I just told you they might, they will make wizards so much better than they are now. To be more efficient is all that is going to help us. What the fuck do you want? Res's, heals, and c2?<br>
<br>
It's all fun and cool to jump on the "Verant suxx0rz d00d th3y c@n't d0 ne thing rite!" boat, but this is going to far. Seriously, Elnots, you've ranted about TL's because you'd lose business. *sigh* Give it a fucking chance! They were on test server for a <b>couple hours</b> and you are already composing your "Fuck You Verant" letter.<br>
<br>
This could be the wizard's single most defining trait. Don't you think that a wizard with a, say, big drake sort of hovering over his shoulder might be an impressive sight, and that maybe the fact that at level 60 your spells resist less, and you seem to have more mana because your casting costs have been reduced by a great percentage, and your spells are hitting harder might be something that would empower wizards? *IF* it does just that, the wizards may just be overpowered *GASP!!!*<br>
<br>
~~~~~~~~~~ATTN: GIST OF MESSAGE APPROACHING!!~~~~~~~~~~<br>
<b>Get off the fucking Anti-Verant train. Show the game designers a little respect before they nerf familiars into regular mage pets. Stop your bitching... or quit the game if you think wizards are so fucked up.</b> <br>
~~~~~~~~~~END OF GIST OF MESSAGE!!~~~~~~~~~~<br>
<br>
Anyway, not that it matters. By the time SoL comes out, their will be maybe 64 EQ players still around. Everyone else will be in SB =)<br>

Wizards don't get any buffs that can be cast on other players.  O'Keil's is the only thing that you can &quot;give&quot; to someone else.<br>
<br>
My original character was a wizard, though I only played him to about level 17.  I often kept O'Keil's memmed, even though it wasn't that great a spell.  It was just nice to have something that you could cast on other people to help them.  It would have been nice to have an upgrade at level 12, too.<br>
<br>
Once the druids and mages get their good damage shields, O'Keil's is obsolete and becomes pretty much irrelevant.  By that time, however, wizards are getting TPs and good nukes.  An upgrade to O'Keil's would be useful during those early levels when wizards are so weak.<br>
<br>
I don't think this has anything to do with class balancing.  That's what the lure spells, the expanded TLs, and maybe the familiar are all about.  No one is going to have much sympathy for a class that whines about its upgrades while other classes are being nerfed. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ususpiriaschattenjager.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Suspiria Schattenjager</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 47<br> <font color=#E9D756>(7/21/01 6:08:38 am)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Wizard's new spell Summon Familiar</span><hr size=1> Here we go again with the whinies---one SPDAT file supposedly has all the info---meanwhile, game ain't out till Christmas.<br>

Shut up, Elnots.  You make wizards sound like whiney bitches.<br>
<br>
Anything they add to the class is good, period.  Even if it doesn't fit your ideallistic expectations it is still something that class gains.<br>
<br>
As long as things are added and not taken away why complain, especially when you have no clue what those additions might entail.<br>

<br>
Being a Necromancer I've heard/done my share of whining I suppose, just like any of the other 'support classes'. The only limits on the performance of you class are put on you by yourself. Be happy that Verant realizes there is a problem, and is working towards fixing it. That's further then they have gone for most classes.  <p><font size=-1 face="Impact"><center>

Pretty cool spells, if you ask me. The level 39 DD with a root?! Simply awesome. Familiars? Wow! I had to send a message to Geoff Zatkin on the familiars. He and I would go round and round about them. I don't care if they just sit there and do nothing. A familiar is wizard-defining.. very neat indeed. How about the O'Keils addition? Yes, I know.. it's a very low damage shield but for a level 12 wizard, remember.. you are still part of the fray every now and again. Not to mention you can drop it on party members and it's also a Fire Resist buff.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uarnwolfmagnuson.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Arnwolf Magnuson</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 215<br> <font color=#E9D756>(7/21/01 8:21:13 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Wizard's new spell Summon Familiar</span><hr size=1> At this point...since we seem to be doing class complaints, I would like to complain that my warrior can't cast enough spells. <br>

Just FYI...if you go to the Graffe's page, Graffe wrote that this is a wizard defining spell, not VI as far as I can see.<br>

<br>
But anyhoo, I'm not mad at VI for giving wizards the hind end of the shaft, but I do enjoy a good Verant beating, sort of like how the brit's used to enjoy beating bears in the olden days, but with a hell of a.. what was I saying? <br>
<br>
Anyway, I'm gonna say sorry for making you think I'm not enjoying myself and actually hoping my bitching does some good on these boards. I'm just having aspot of fun, this is the rant board. I like getting to just bitch and moan and stuff, I don't bitch out people on this board cause that shits personal and as Sarkam so well put it, it should be dealt with in game, when I bitch, I bitch in general, I should prolly put up a signature that says all posts made are posts that are either A) for the sheer hell of bitching on a bitch board. or B) insert excuse here.<br>
<br>
Sorry if I'm making the whole wizard comunity look like bitchers and complainers, I don't think I am. *Shrug*<br>

Guess what....they did. The stuff you want is in the Temple of Veeshan. Me and Sarkam have been exploring the boards looking at the items; and alot of them are caster friendly. /smirks BUt I doubt that we casters would get them since some are those lovely all/all things....hehehe <p>~In the end, it is all a game..and Verant owns our soul~<BR>

Seriously, Elnots, your post *does* make Wizzies sound like a bunch of whining crybabies, even though anyone with half a brain would realize that you don't speak for all of us.<br>
<br>
I treasure my Wizzie.  I like *any* new spells I get, because it's just plain fun to have new stuff.  I *love* having TL's, it has made life for me AND my guildies soooooo much simpler.<br>
<br>
And I seriously doubt that any spell that costs as much mana as the familiars do is not going to do anything.<br>

<br>
Are we uber damage merchants?<br>
NO.<br>
Any class just about can outdamage a wizard in both short and long fights above level 50.  At level 60 I still have rogues and dr00ds outdamaging me ALL THE TIME regardless of how much manadumping I do.  For those that still point to Ice Comet as the single spell that makes wizzies the best dmg output.. get with the times.. Ice Comet is so inefficient with mana and takes so long to cast (not to mention being ice based is resisted most places in Velious) that I never see wizzies use it.  I've tried and simply used more mana for little extra dmg.<br>
<br>
Are we favoured teleported/translocators?<br>
Hardly.<br>
Dr00ds can port to almost all the places wizzies can - with PoH and PoA as exceptions.. but who goes there now anyway?  On top of this dr00ds can swallow (succor) to zone safe spot same as a wizzie evac.<br>
Add to this their abilities in healing, buffing and even a little bit of melee, where does a wizzie fit in a group now?<br>
<br>
Does Translocate make us wanted again?<br>
BIG NO!<br>
How many groups are you gonna be a part of when the sole purpose of Translocate is to send the person AWAY from you, and you stay where you are?  That is NOT the way to promote grouping amongst players. &quot;Here group with me for a TL.. then disband at the other end pls&quot; is not my idea of taking part in a group.<br>
<br>
For most of our playing life wizzies are excellent at soloing, and Verant seem to make this the most attractive option for us.  Once we hit the upper levels we find that you get NOWHERE if you are solo.  Times change and it's too late to change classes <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I guess the main complaint for me is that I have many friends that are dr00ds, and now we are all in the high 50s and a few level 60s amongst us we can never do anything together as a group of 6 becoz my wizzie conflicts with their dr00ds, and vice versa.  Either I have to drop from the group or the dr00d has to.  We don't belong together now, yet for the first 50 levels we were MADE for each other.  More times-a-changing <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Only time I get to group with my dr00d friends is on multi-group raids... not single group camps.<br>
<br>
One consolation through all this... when you get to 60 (as I did 2 weeks ago) you get this awesome feeling of &quot;I've done it!&quot; regardless of what obstacle (real or imagined) the game designers put in your way.  I guess they don't make it easy for a reason... just wish I knew their reasons for the imbalance <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Class balance is SOOOOO contentious... I know how bad I feel as a wizzie sometimes... but I can't help but wonder how much the other classes go thru the same thing in different ways.  Not playing any other class than my wizzie I really don't know.  I'm speaking from a wizzie point of view and I don't apologise for that <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I do remember from the old days though that rangers were constantly mentioned as the most nerfed and screwed up class.  I never met a ranger back then that didn't have a major complaint about Verant... maybe it's wizzies turn now.<br>
<br>
Seeing as this is a flaming section too... I feel the need to reiterate my favourite one-liner.. &quot;Berit you can KISS MY ASS!&quot; <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

In light of this thread and some other recent threads, the wizard class is now unchallenged as the whiniest class in EQ.<br>
<br>
A wizard can't outdamage a rogue?  Well, neither can anyone else.  The rogue class has its own built-in limitations, which should be fairly obvious.  If rogues were so awesome, there would be a lot more of them.<br>
<br>
A wizard can't outnuke a druid?  Say what?  I'm yet to hear anyone say, &quot;we need big time damage output -- grab that druid!&quot;  There are a lot of druids who will tell you all about how screwed over they are in the 50+ game.<br>
<br>
Wizards can't group with druids very often?  Tell that one to the paladin or necro who can't even find a group in the first place.<br>
<br>
I'm not going to say that wizards haven't gotten screwed over since the release of RoK, nor am I going to deny that SoV made matters worse for wizards.   But sheesh, get a grip. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showMessageRange?topicID=2164.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showMessageRange?topicID=2164.topic&start=41&stop=56>3</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showMessage?topicID=2162.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showMessage?topicID=2146.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.emailToFriend?topicID=2164.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.threadControl?topicID=2164.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/deleteThreadFire.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=2164.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=2164.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub4.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="emarrmessageboardrules">Message Board Rules<option value="emarrlinks">Links<option value="emarrupcomingmmorpgs">Upcoming MMOG's<option value="emarrfrm16">The Emarr Quadrant<option value="emarrgeneral">General<option value="emarrfrm17">Funny Stuff<option value="emarrbazaar">Item Bazaar<option value="emarrscrollsnspells">Spell Bazaar<option value="emarrfrm15">Shiny Things<option value="emarrfrm14">Bargain Basement<option value="emarrdragonsandplanes">Rants and Flames<option value="emarrfrm13">Dragons and Planes<option value="emarrroleplaying">Roleplaying<option value="emarrroleplayingoocforum">Roleplaying - OOC Forum<option value="emarrscammeralert">Scammer Alert<option value="emarrsignaturecorner">Test Forum<option value="emarrreallife">Real Life<option value="emarrothermmorpgs">Other MMOG's</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#E9D756>- </font><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/bemarr>Erollisi Marr, The Queen of Love</a><font color=#E9D756> - </font><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes>Rants and Flames</a> <font color=#E9D756> - </font><br><br> <br>
