<br>
<br>
I joined DG after going on several raids with them in early Spring of last year and grouping with alot of their members and spent the next few months on probi status, well I was gone for a month as I was moving and got back and learned a bunch of officers quit, including my friend Volfie. Well I stayed on for several months up until Christmas and then stopped playing again for 2 months as I moved three times in that time period, and regained playing time in the Spring, then I ran out of cash and had to stop playing for 3 weeks till I got more in I believe it was May. Well I come back, and have been grouping hunting raiding with DG and having a total blast with some very cool people.<br>
<br>
I'm sorry to say, Maximilan obviously didn't seem to like me very much. I don't know what happened with me and him because honestly, I never hunted with him and only saw him on occasion as we played different times. But as a friend posted a message for me on the board I went to go get access as I had never done so before and Max didn't want me to get access, or ask him or his bud Landario to get access, as I was just a wannabe.<br>
<br>
Hurt I decided I'd talk to the online officers and see what's up. They said that Max was easily agitated and they'd talk to him for me. I thanked them and went about my business.  <br>
<br>
The next morning I tracked phini spawn and got on guildchat and asked guildwide if anyone could help. Got a good amount of people to kill him, but then Max had to let me know over guild that he would make it a priority not to help me.<br>
<br>
Hurt and insulted by his blatent rudeness I tried to make light of the situation by inserting a little humor by saying, And here we have Max, being a stick in the mud :P<br>
<br>
Hell I pretend to cyber dorf's and step on Syl's tail and crack jokes about Agat's*God rest his soul* homosexuality(Good times, good times)<br>
<br>
So I didn't think Max would be offended anymore than he offended me* OH NO! I called him a stick in the MUD! The Mud, I tell you!<br>
<br>
But Max, seizing this oppurtunity I suppose, said bye bye Elnots!<br>
<br>
And poof, gone from DG like that, bu bye my friends.<br>
<br>
I kept trying to talk to the officers to see what happened but couldn't get a straight answer out of any of them, cept I will look into it.<br>
<br>
Found out later from Coroq*fav barb war* that someone posted that my records where lost on the message board, which I didn't have access too.. and was surprised I didn't protest when I didn't respond to them putting me back on probation.<br>
<br>
If I had known I would have gone on probation, I would have been pissed, but I loved DG and would have gone to those raids, not said a peep. <br>
<br>
So what if I got disbanded? I should just go join another guild, some friends tell me.  I put alot of time into helping the guild, into porting those in need, into helping other wizards get their epics and hunting with some of the best people on the server. I loved DG alot. But the hatred of one man ruined all that for me.<br>
<br>
To those left behind in DG, Parum, Qiteroplyisis, Xtram, Vincraft, Thanquilor*cry*, Sylendria*pout*, Skafloc, Coroq, I'll miss you guys. It was a blast being guilded with you, and I'll try to keep in touch.<br>
<br>
To Max, dude. What can I say? You kicked me out of one of the servers best guilds, you won, you're the senior officer with the highest rank. I wish we could work out our differences but you're just an awful person.<br>

Elnots,<br>
<br>
First of all remember Max isnt the only officer in DG. All officers work together and the subject of your removal was discussed before it was carried out.<br>
<br>
Since you joined us you have been a casual player at best, appearing at odd times then disappearing for months at a time ( even you admit this in your post above ). This is evident as well from the fact you joined us in your lower 50's and are still only 56, when many others have joined us 3 or 4 months back at 56 and have hit 60 already.<br>
<br>
Unfortunatley this was also linked with an attitude that you had been in Guild a long time and as such had seniority over newer people.<br>
<br>
You are not the only casual player we have removed recently, and possibly may not be the last. Nowadays continuity of play and ability to contribute heavily when you play are very important factors to us, and unfortunatley these are things which you are weak on.<br>
<br>
I wish you the best for the future in EQ. <p><a href="http:\\www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=64513">Aaniudari Arithenne</a><br>

Yea he has a temper (he's German! /hug) but then when you play EQ as much as he does (and I did) and have a lot of responsibility with organising things, sorting out problems, etc.. etc.. your patience does wear kind of thin.  I always used to find him kind of cutely amusing, but then I was pretty stroppy when i led raids and was an officer too /hide.<br>
<br>
From what i've seen DG has completely changed since I was around but a few of the good players I remember are still there.... Max was always undeniably one of the best clerics/rogues I ever met in EQ.<br>
<br>
Sorry to hear that though Elnots <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  A lot of guilds in EQ are trying to stick with a hardcore crew and weed out the casual players for the sake of security and *continuity* as it were, i'm sure it wasn't personal (although it probably seemed that way).<br>

<br>
Competition at the lower high range (NToV, Klandicar, ST, Dain, CT, KT, etc) is very very tough. There are many guilds in that range: DG, Affliction, CE, KX, PC, RoD as well as Magister and MF if they feel like taking a break from owning Luclin. Boss mobs die hours after spawning.  The key is to be able to mobilize quickly, and the key to mobilizing quickly is to have enough people online to kill the mob.<br>
<br>
This is why guilding high playtime members has become increasingly important.  The game is becoming more and more top heavy as more people level to 60 and want to be a part of the &quot;high level raid action,&quot; there isn't enough high level raid content to support all of us.<br>
<br>
Verant needs to double the content or spawn times, it might add some breathing room, reduce competition and improve server relations.<br>
<br>
PoP will help, but it's going to be a long summer. <p><a href="http://www.saraquael.com/gloriana.html"><img src="http://fyd.fuxored.net/glorymedium.jpg" border="0"></a><p>

Maybe instead of stupid sarcastic questions that show you don't know or care the about the truth of the statement you responded to, you should take a few momemts and *gasp* think about the rational of many casual players in a hard core guild.<br>
<br>
Some guilds are out to actually <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> play the game</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> instead of saying hi to random_person8923 who logs on once a month and pretends to be an active player when they contribute nothing to the guild goals.  This may very well differ than what you are probably used to (which is why you mock it with no basis).  Some guilds play the game only to be with friends and some guilds play with friends but for the greater goal of accomplishing things.  These are totally different mentalities, but it's amazing how people like you make sarcastic ass remarks about the latter type when it makes perfect sense for people who are really playing the game.<br>
<br>
And before someone responds to say &quot;he was only asking a question!&quot; I'll give you my response of &quot;no, he wasn't&quot;.<br>

Let's put it this way, if a new guild started up and had a requirment of playing EQ 20 hours a day, then who would you be to question their charter? Uber guilds put a lot of time into the game, and if you don't put the time in you get removed, it's that simple. <p><center><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=6929">Rolelen Dwarkarn - 59 Myrmidon </a><br>

When a player makes the decision to join a guild like DG, they must be very aware of the fact that the guild has very high expectations of their members.  Be it, playing time, instant availability to raids, or respond to calls for MOB take downs, etc,  these conditions are paramount to the success of such a guild.<br>
<br>
Whether one agrees with these policies or not is irrelevant.  Everyone has choices, join the guild, join another, or don't join any.  Once you accept the guild invitation, you are accepting their policies.  That acceptance brings with it obligations as well as potential benefits.  When you fail to fulfill your end of the agreement, (even though you might believe you have valid and understandable reasons for such failure) you can only expect to be removed from the guild.  <br>
<br>
While I feel bad that you are not guilded with some great friends of yours, it is clear that you were not fulfilling your role as a DG guild member.<br>
<br>
So don't go blaming Max for being a &quot;guild comes first&quot; responsible officer.  Was he a prick? No.  Could he have communicated the reasons for removal from the guild to you?  Yes, if he and the other DG officers felt it was warranted.<br>

We had the people that would ALWAYS be first up and in on every raid they could possibly attend and help the guild as much as they could (people like Algarr, Alarick, Melkizedek, Max/Div, Aaniudari, Llewella, Ayron etc.. come to mind - no offense to any I didn't name i'm stoned and in a hurry <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ).  These were the people that would come to mind when it comes to dealing with loot allocations because I knew we'd be seeing them again on the next raid, and the next, etc...<br>
<br>
We also had the people that would be on most raids and be helpful and willing.  These generally made up the *backbone* of the guild.<br>
<br>
Then we have people who log in every now and then, join some raids at random, and a certain few who would stay anon and PL their latest twink or just do whatever they felt like doing (grin).  These are the people that (often with no malicious intent whatsoever) bring the guild down in terms of integrity and ESPECIALLY loot allocation.  I'm not saying they aren't great players, I'm not saying they aren't great people, but attendance is a very important factor in a raiding guild and it's unfair to both the player and the guild as a whole when you have to make up on-the-spot rules and decisions regarding these people.  That's why raiding guilds stick to a tight schedule (eg playtimes), a core set of players that can be relied upon to be there when needed and a strict set of *rules* (as such) on how things are handled.<br>
<br>
I'm sure Elnots was a good addition to DG.... but the point is, DG is a raiding guild and Elnots would only have been a good addition *when he was online and participating* insofar as the guild raiding is concerned.  It's all very well being a friendly, fun person - but it's no use if you aren't around helping the guild achieve it's goals.<br>
<br>
Casual guilds are strewn about all over the place which suit the casual gamer fine.  If you want to be in a raiding guild and kill high end mobs, then you have to put in the time and effort just as every other high end guild member has.<br>

how is this going to help the situation?<br>
He doesnt show up for raids as it is and saying he couldnt have loot for xx raids would make him just say "@#%$ it, now i wont raid at all" and we are back where we started. <br>

<br>
I have a few issues to bring up; and since its already here in Rants..might as well continue it.<br>
<br>
<br>
"First of all remember Max isnt the only officer in DG. All officers work together and the subject of your removal was discussed before it was carried out."<br>
<br>
This is all good and wonderful, really it is.  Maybe the officers should have actually informed him his crimes before being booted? Seems kind of on the sorry side; actually more on the fvcked up side. I can respect any guild that boots a player for being casual when its a hard core raiding guild.     Maybe the next victim will get told his/her crime before being disbanded.. <br>
<br>
But the wierd thing is, when Elnots plays...I never ever see more than 20 members of DG on...most of the time I see them in the morning. Should the people that play in the evening be booted as well? Isnt their playtime inconsistent to the rest of the guild?<br>
<br>
As for his leveling time, it took me awhile to get from 56-60. Ask any members of my guild. They use to razz the hell out of me for it..but I made it. Elnots has been logging in and looking for a group every night that I am on; and if I wasnt living in Vex Thal at the moment I would be there helping him out. Why you ask?. Because he is a friend and a former guildmate..and guildmates help each other out...<br>

<br>
Second off, if someone sat down and talked with me about the things brought up here, you not uber enough, you need to find another guild, then my current anger level would have been significantly reduced and I prolly wouldn't have come here to rant about it.  <br>
<br>
But instead of that I guess someone must have said, disband him whenever you feel like it.<br>
<br>
I don't get it, aani you said you discussed it, but only when Max was being an @#%$ and I defended myself did he say, HA take this!<br>
<br>
And Aamrie brings up a valid point imo, I have about 20 screenshots *sontalak, VS, lodizal, phin, RF, CT, Inno, etc etc.* of raids that I've been on within the past 4 months with DG. And all within my play time, as in, I help the players in my play time. <br>
<br>
And as well as my level, I don't sit in EC auctioning @#%$, I don't go afk for hours at a time, but I have 123 playing days. That's time spent trying to level, or raiding with friends/guilds.   <br>
<br>
Don't gripe me out because I'm not at your level, I spend all sorts of evenings being LFG all night because no guild groups want someone below 60.<br>
<br>
Which brings up an instance with a certain rogue in DG who wanted to make a group in CT, I asked to come along and he said sure, but ignored me as well did his whole group when all the other level 60's showed up and went off to kill oozes or lizards or what not. I wish they would have just said something like, I need to find someone higher..<br>
<br>
And twice I was told I was nothing but an EXP sponge and didn't want to be in their group, AGAIN with DG members, ask Sylendria if what I said is true there.<br>
 <br>
I'm sorry I was not l33t enough to stay with DG, and I am positively sure that Max disbanded me only because it was talked about and decided best. If you read my first post you'll see that what you say and what he did just go hand in hand..... *cough*<br>
<br>
Or it could just be a cover up to save face, either way that was wrong how you did that stuff Aani, and to think I didn't charge you officers for TL's.. with the respect you give me here in defense of Max's actions in the way he did things, I should of just been an ass, would have had the same effect it seems, be nice, considerate, helpful, get booted. Be rude, selfish, jerkoff, get booted.<br>
<br>
Guess it all comes to playing time then, did you think to ask me if I could have given someone some account info to play my character at raids? I have money problems, I have to work, in all my free time I play EQ, so do alot of EQ players, but you booted me cause I myself don't play as much as you'd like..<br>
<br>
<br>
I could give you three good examples, but come on, you all know people that give others their account info so they can be present at raids or just whenever needed.<br>
<br>
So in closing, you're excuses for keeping me disbanded blow, and you're trying to cover Max's ass for him. That's all I'm really trying to say in this reply. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/udwarkarn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dwarkarn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 4188<br> <font color=#E9D756>(6/27/02 9:06:41 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3441.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: DG rant</span><hr size=1> In all reality you got booted, suck it up, move on and deal with it, it's not your guild someone else who &quot;owns&quot; the guild must not want you in it. <p><center><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=6929">Rolelen Dwarkarn - 59 Myrmidon </a><br>

<br>
Elnots I'd just sit back and chill, move on to another guild, it's pointless trying to get anything out of a guild thats booted you, becuase you did wrong in some way (even if this isn't true on your eyes).<br>
<br>
My advice to you would be to steer clear of euro guilds, trust me you'll be happier in the long run (I live in England, so technically I'm European, hehe although that may be in doubt), American guilds are great, infact americans are all kinda fun, bit like big dumb puppies just out for fun and to catch that stick.<br>
