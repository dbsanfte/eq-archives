The Right wishes to kill Bin Laden<br>
The Left let him go<br>
<br>
<br>
As far as the current economic situation, I place a good share of the blame on slicky Willy for 2 reasons:<br>
<br>
1)  Failure to deal with Bin Laden<br>
<br>
I think it was '96 when Bin Laden was offered up to the U.S. government.  He had been captured and was being held by the Sudanese government.  Clinton said to let him go.<br>
<br>
2)  Urging the Fed to raise interest rates during the end of his administration<br>
<br>
The economy was doing great during the years that the Republicans controlled both houses of Congress.   Given the fact that Clinton was a huge embaressment for the Democrats, as well as the country, the Democrats realized that the Republicans were going to get the White House.<br>
<br>
With this knowledge, and their plans to start regaining control of Congress in 2002 and Congress/Presidency in 2004, Clinton started urging Greenspan to raise the Fed dramatically.   Clinton's economists realized that the slowing down of the economy wouldn't take place until a year or so down the road.  Then the Democrats could claim that the slowing of the economy was the Republicans fault.<br>
<br>
Just as predicted, the economy seriously started slowing down right about the time that Bush was taking office.  Even without 9/11 tradegy and more recent corporate scandals, the economy would have slowed down.  One of the first things Bush did when taking office was to start putting pressure on Greenspan to lower the Fed.  You are already starting to see major signs that the economy is looking better.  Because of 9/11 and recent scandals the recovery will take a bit longer, but you will see the economy really booming again by late/spring early summer of next year.<br>

<br>
As for me insisting on not liking you.  To use your own stance,  nowhere did I say I do or do not like you.  In fact, I have no feelings either way really.  If I didn't like you or more so hated you, then I would do what Raed does and attack you at every opportunity.  In fact it is quite the opposite.  Some of your posts DO have some good points, thoughts, reasoning, rational. <br>
<br>
On to the heart of the matter.<br>
<br>
I am sorry to hear about your friends who are unemployed,  and that is genuine.  I myself and some friends have gone into business for ourselves after being laid off back in october and jobs in our field just not existing.<br>
<br>
So, also having quite a few friends out of work, I to would love nothing more than to lay a concrete blame, point a determined finger at a single cause for the problems.   It just can't happen though.  As much as we would like it to, it just can't.  Not this time around.<br>
<br>
A lot of the blame can be laid at the feet of investor confidence.  They have none.<br>
<br>
Now you brought up Microsoft.  Microsoft has nothing to do with this.  They are in a league of their own.  Personally, as crazy as it sounds, Ithink they are trying to do as much as possible that is "questionable" to keep the courts as busy as possible and not be able to ever truly pin them down on anything.  They however will do it to themselves, I know of 4 major companies in this area who are either investigating, or moving into the phase where they can move away from an MS based company. That is a different rant however ;)<br>
<br>
Yes, the president has effects on the economy (the president meaning the administration currently in office).   I won't say republicans over democrats or vice versa because quite honestly the whole party division thing is a waste of time and does nothing more than support lines of opposition.  I think they should do away with the whole party system all together.  They don't mean what they used to, at least not as clearly as they used to.<br>
<br>
Foreign economies also have an effect on our economy.<br>
Consumer spending.<br>
Investor Confidence.<br>
Corporate growth.<br>
War.<br>
<br>
All have effects on our economy.<br>
<br>
Foreign economies,  I dont think have a great deal at this time to do with anything.<br>
<br>
War.  Yes,  the whole afgahn thing is definatly having an effect.  Can bush (Shrub.. hehe cute),  back out now?  Until his advisors tell him too, no.  (Remember a Pres and an administration is only as good as it's advisors).  The bulk of the people still want us there.  Likewise,  everyone condemned daddy Bush, AND Clinton for getting involved in things like this and not finishing the job.  Bush started it with binnie boy,  how can he back out without it being done?  Just devils advocate there for a min.<br>
<br>
Now lets look at the last three.  Just to see what that does to us.<br>
<br>
The situation:<br>
    Corporate america has taken a major beating over the last few quarters.   9-11 has effected corporations in MANY ways, but then along comes the sudden realization that big business is not on the straight and narrow.  Yes so far only a handful have been questioned (Worldcomm, Enron, Arthur Anderson, Merck, etc etc..  yes Merck was absolved but they were added for a day or two.).  These companies are tanking, investors are gettign MAJORLY screwed.  Investor confidence is shakey.<br>
<br>
Investors are not investing like they used to.  Companies have to have income to grow.  One of these sources of income are investors. Contrary to popular belief it is a biggie too.<br>
<br>
Now,  after 9-11 unemployment took a major hit.  It would be up to the administration and corporate america to bring it back.  Administration too busy dealing with how to heal the wounds so now it is up to corporate america.  Corp america is losing backing, being forced to cut jobs.   People out of work can't spend.  Corporate america loses consumer spending,  corporate growth stalls.  We are stuck in a nasty circle.<br>
<br>
Can the administration change this?  Yes.  When? When the majority of the people stop crying for revenge and start crying for our countries growth.  Right now, (and justifiably so) they want blood.   <br>
<br>
SO what is all of this to say?  Simply that there are MANYMANY factors in an economy.  While the administration does have effects,  right now. . our current situation... there are so many negative forces on the major factors of our economy, that we are in deep @#%$ until some MAJOR changes occur.<br>
<br>
In adminstration, in business, in general.  I don't think the administration can do enough on it's own to fix this.  Some blame, and some responsibility has to be laid on the corporations as well.<br>
<br>

<br>
I could just as easily post a list such as this:<br>
<br>
The Right: Violates civil liberties<br>
The Left: Preserves civil liberties<br>
<br>
The Right: Violates seperation of church and state<br>
The Left: Upholds the framers' intent.<br>
<br>
The Right: Supports racial disparity and discrimination<br>
The Left: Supports racial equality<br>
<br>
The Right: Supports profits at the expense of workers wages<br>
The Left: Supports decent worker compensation<br>
<br>
...I could go on.  However, this list would be totally bunk.  Just like, in fact, the piece of crap you just tossed up.  I know conservatives who are vile, contemptable individuals, and I know those who are genuinely appalled at some really stupid things the liberal movement has done.  I also know liberals who are vile, contemptable individuals, as well as those who are really interested in social justice in a way your average Ditto-head cannot understand or empathize with.<br>
<br>
The biggest mistake people make is trying to group folks into either category, and then having a field day with the stereotypes and charicitures.  Finding someone who in personal life emulates your notions of the stereotypical liberal or conservative is nigh on impossible, it is very hard to find someone who totally swallows whatever the ideological party line is they are most associated with.<br>
<br>
For instance, your post sure as heck does not make me think less of the right, but it goes a long way towards pointing out some well-entrenched brainwashing in whatever is passing for your psyche.  Grow up, look at the facts, and try and think a little bit more independently than what ideologue_01 told you on the radio.  That list was a freaking joke, just like the one above. <p><center><IMG SRC=" http://www.unicorntrad.org/mal_sig.jpg"></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/udawnen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dawnen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 15<br> <font color=#E9D756>(7/17/02 12:39:32 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3470.topic&index=45>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Fair enough</span><hr size=1> Ghie - I started getting scared around Nov '99.  It is true I could have waited a bit longer to pull out and made a bit more money, but now my decision to bail when I did looks pretty good.  If I could figure it out I'm sure these big wigs did too.  You don't see billionaires on the news complaining about how much money they lost.  The ones that got hurt were the average uneducated mutual fund holder crying about how they thought the ride was going to last forever.  <br>
<br>
The ones urging for interest rate hikes were well aware of what was going to happen and I'm sure they moved a large percentage of their wealth into bonds/real estate and other such investments to weather out the storm.<br>
<br>
Malevant -  I have looked at the facts and I stand by my assessments.   Granted, when I was young and idealistic I used to believe the lies and fear tactics used by the Democrats.  I used to believe in Santa Claus back then also.<br>
<br>
But then I grew up and started trying to find out the truth for myself.  It wasn't easy to find the truth.  Most americans don't read any further than the headlines of the liberal controlled media.  But some of us are willing to put forth the time and effort to dig a little deeper.  <br>
<br>
That is what I suggest to all americans do before they vote.  Do the research.  Put forth the effort.  Don't take anything at face value. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ucaelie.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Caelie</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 76<br> <font color=#E9D756>(7/17/02 1:06:46 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3470.topic&index=46>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Fair enough</span><hr size=1> Malevant, that could go on forever.

Just because I'm a right winger doesn't mean I'm against racial equality. Difference is, I don't think its the Governments place to step in and tell employers who they have to hire.<br>
<br>
 Its not the governments place to support people forever with Welfare. Do I feel pity for the less fortunate? Of course I do, but thats where friends and family should come in and help care for them. Most Republicans feel that as long as the Government is taking care of people, why would the have any incentive to do better? When do people stand up and try to do better? I know if I was cold and hungry and not getting help from the government, I would definately try to better myself. I don't think anybody is saying that Democrats or Republicans are any better or any worse than the other. The whole argument is about each individuals opinion on how things should be run.<br>

Real Life government should be like the game EQ. What does the government do in EQ? Provides a military. Did EQ just give us stuff or did we have to earn it? Do they force the good and the evil characters or the black and white characters to play together. No, we do that on our own. <br>
90% of the players out there are genuinally good people and I'm sure we're not all of the same party. Yeah, EQ has its share of terriorists (KS'rs; Intentional Trainers; but they're delt with in time. I buff newbies in Misty Thicket, but not because the EQ government tells me I have to. I do it because I want to.<br>

I'm not a Right winger thats way out there. I even support seat belt laws, helmet laws, car seat laws etc. but I don't believe in hand-outs and thats what seperates me from the Left wingers that are way out there.<br>

My whole point is that this guy can't go pointing fingers at Bush no more than we can go pointing fingers at the Clinton administration just because they're not the party of his choice. As one guy posted, several factors have caused the decline in the economy. As far as Democraps, I was refering to Clinton specifically and those that condone his behavior. Theres a democrat in Georgia that I would vote for in a heartbeat if he was to run for President and thats Zell Miller. <p>Caelie<BR>
