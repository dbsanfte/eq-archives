Luck was upon us that night and Edge of the Nightwalker dropped:<br>
<br>
Edge of the nightwalker:<br>
14/25<br>
One hand Slashing weapon<br>
+8 str +8 dex +8 agi 4.5 weight<br>
WAR,PAL,RNG,SHD,BRD,ROG<br>
ALL Races<br>
<br>
As per current loot rules we rolled on it for all classes present that could use it. Titanias the warrior won the blade. WE went on our way and then did some research and found out that the blade was uber-rare and worth 80kpp+<br>
<br>
Titanias joked about selling the sword since it was worth so much. We decided at that point to implement a new rule on this sword within our guild. The sword was not to be sold or to leave the guild. If Titanias ever left the game we would give it to another war within the guild to use as this was really more of a war weapon than any other class. Titanias agreed to this as well as everybody else. Perhaps Razboinik was not present when we decided this or chose to ignore this ruling...<br>
<br>
DAoC came out not too long ago and Titanias had grown tired of EQ. Being my best friend in RL I of course reaped the reward of hes departure. I inhereted the accounts and all that existed on them.  I created twinks and met him in th bank at Freeport to transfer the goodies over. We had decided to hand the sword over to Blackmoonx to weild as he was another RL friend of ours. Low and behold who shows up with hes hand out but Razboinik. He appeared and requested the sword from Titanias. After much deliberation we came to realize that this wasnt a bad idea. Raz was close to obtaining hes epic anyway. We decided that since Raz was a higher level war that he should get the sword. After all he was part of Domination and could be trusted and was an honorable fellow it seemed. We handed the sword over to him and he bowed and left. The next day he removed hes guildtag and retired from Domination going on to some other guild he decided was uber that could help him get hes epic easier...<br>
<br>
I have requested the sword back and was told: He would give it back when he got hes epic... After some thought he decided he may not give it back ever. He deserved it since he was highest war in Domination for such a long time. He had carried the guild on hes shoulders the entire time he was in Domination and we were tagging along on hes shirt-tails. He took us anywhere we went and was the entire reason for all the things we had and Domination had never done anything for him. He had never won anything from Domination raids and looking through hes equipment he couldnt find one piece that Domination had ever helped him get. He was outraged that he didnt receive the sword to begin with because any other guild would have given that sword to him, not rolled on it. Besides this was a gift given to him from Titanias to do with as he pleased.<br>
<br>
Thinking maybe this was just a misunderstanding I told Titanias to clear things up for him and send him an e-mail. Titanias sent a letter telling him it was not a personal gift and to give it up. He still refuses and keeps acting like a wounded puppy about how DOmination hurt hes feelings and never cared for him and used and abused him without care or reward. One 3 day stint in Plane of AIr comes to mind where we obtained hes war blade. Im sure most of the things he won from Domination he has sold to get better equipment.<br>
<br>
Razboinik's ethics are in question here as well as hes honor. I plead with him to return the sword to Domination NOW.  Hes way of thinking or hes feelings are irrelevant. He was in Domination and as a member agreed to our rules as they were at the time. NOT how he felt they should be. It is wrong of him to steal the sword from us and Im sorry he thinks we owe him something other than what we gave him.<br>
<br>
Razboinik please return the sword now and restore your honor.<br>
<br>
All feel free to post here on wether I am being just in my accusations and let Raz or myself know how you feel about this. <p>Severene Majere 56 High Elf Cleric Officer of Domination<br>

Dingostix applied on an open forum to UI, but was never guilded.  He also applied to Magister I believe.  Not sure on how they handled that.<br>
<br>
Now Regarding Razboinik.  I remember months ago him KS'ing some of my former guild mates twinks in W. Commons.  He was following them around and KS'ing every mob they tried to kill.  When they asked why he was doing that, his reply was because I'm 60 and I can.  What a dork! <p><center>

Just like mine says seeking blonde hair dye.<br>
<br>
As for this situation,  I am real disappointed in Razboinik on a personal level.  <br>
<br>
Raz used to be an officer in Domination and always seemed to do his best, even in hard times.  What surprises me so much is how much what he says now is different from how he behaved in the guild.  When he was in Domination, he was (or so I thought) a stand up guy who cared a lot about the guild.  I can understand the frustrations of being an officer, I was one in another guild at one time, however, it is a position he could have chosen to give up.  <br>
<br>
What disappoints me so much though is the fact that Raz won't give the sword back to our guild for its use.  Titanias could have sold that sword but instead chose to abide by a rule passed after he had won the random to keep it within the guild, which is an awesome thing to do.  Its not just the fact that there are three other warriors lvl 54 to 58 (maybe 59 now) that could use it, its the fact that this gives us the total appearance that Raz doesn't care at all about Domination, the people in it, who he might be screwing over with this, or most importantly - his own reputation.  <br>
<br>
Anyways, I know its a game, and I am not about to get worked up over a sword, but in EQ reality (what other reality is there after all) what Razb is doing is very very disappointing to those of us who once called him family.<br>
<br>
Raz, I know you read these boards.  When you left Dom, we were disappointed that you had left.  I really don't know whether you care what we think or not, but obviously Sev decided to take this public so that others would be aware there is always another side to a person.<br>
<br>
Sorry man that you feel we didn't give you anything and that your time in Domination was a waste.  I know that most of us did our best to get you your epic, but above all else, we cared about you and each other.  <br>
<br>
I'm asking you to post a reply here Razboinik.  It will clear things up for all of us and hopefully, bring this unfortunate episode to an end.  <br>
<br>
Finally consider this.. its a stupid game, are the pixels worth it to you, Raz?  Sorry man, it isnt your sword, even if you feel it ought to be. <br>
<br>
Enough of this.  You've got my opinion Sev.  Hope it helps though I doubt it.<br>

<br>
He left domi because we couldn't support his loot whore needs,he called our guild a bunch of newbies and guildremoved after a long time with us.We have now wasted alot of time on him trying to get epics.How many times Raz were we in chardok for you? EJ? What about that sky raid where we all died 15 times trying to get YOUR epic?? Is your memory that short term?I could care less about where you are now Razboinik,you were a greedy loot whore this entire time.As for you supporting the guild all by yourself, thats one of the most false things I've ever heard. I,as well as the other older members and officers, helped this guild all the time.We lead things and helped you lead things.If you didnt wanna be a person we depended on in domi why were you an officer? /boggle Officership means you are a leader in the guild,it comes with responibilities<br>
<br>
*Shrug* good luck in RoD,get your epics and then leave them for bigger and better things!!! If you have the least bit of character give the item that belongs to the guild who helped YOU on everything back.<br>

<br>
When titanias won the sword (which in itself is BS, 51 warrior who just joined gets an uber item over 60 warrior and main tank for the guild, but that's another point) I tried to buy it from him. He declined but said that if he ever leaves the game he will give it to me.<br>
<br>
So, when he announced his retirement I asked him if he rememberd that, he said yeah, so I met him in bank and he transfered it to me. <br>
<br>
Then a few days later I decided that it was time for me to move on, I had some issues with domination that I would rather not go into here and I didn't leave because of the sword, that's just bull.<br>
<br>
After that, everything was quiet for about a week when all of a sudden they rememberd about their precious sword. Let me tell you something, Sev - that epic you have - I cancelled 2 guild raids that would have benefitted everyone in guild, including me, so you would have it. And I don't understand this, you were going to give it to your RL friend instead of me, and you still say it should have gone to the highest lev and most active tank in guild (me from day1) so don't talk to me about honor and all that crap. <br>
<br>
Cammile, guild defaulted every drop to me??? Since when? How come everything I have was gotten by going on 100s of raids and rolling against 100 newbies for it because my guild didn't give a shit? The only thing I got by default was spiroc blade from sky. I had a talk with Kanly who's a main tank for PS, and 75% of his gear came from guild defaulting it to him. Question is, if I'm such a loot whore, wouln't my gear be at least that and not 0%?<br>
<br>
Anyway, I don't really care what kind of crap people make up about it me, post it all you want. All I wanted to add is that I'm extreemly disappointed with my former guild, or should I say what became of it, since every good person that was ever in Dom eventually quit because of something of this sort. <br>

newbies, hmm , <br>
Just cause your lvl 60 doesnt mean everyone else is a newbie Raz.<br>
 That statement is like an oxy-moron, if you actually got anything out of a raid and lived then I guess the people in the raids arn't &quot;newbies&quot; after all, and i'm sorry , but one guy doesnt make or break a raid.<br>
All it means is you have a bit less of a real life then others.<br>

I'd like to add a little history that Severene never posted, as it doesnt help his story.<br>
<br>
I was in domination from day 1, was an officer up untill 2 weeks ago when i felt the need to move on. Domination was having problems, so i left, and Raz followed.<br>
<br>
First off Severene is one of the newest officers Domination had. He posted tons of Crap posts where he did the same type of thing and ragged on everyone. The first trip to chardok where i was present and he came along comes to mind. Since we where unable to kill the king for Sev's epic, he decides to make this rediculous post bashing the guild and crying about people not staying long enough, he did this as our Guildmessageoftheday(guildmotd). I was asked by several others to remove it, do to offending guildie's.<br>
 <br>
 We had to ask him several times to tone down his posts because all he does is throw things way out of proportion and get people all riled up about by pointing fingers. He bashes Razboinik about being a loot whore(which i never saw, but cannot say isn't fact), but he is right there behind him pissing an moaning about loot. He talks of all the things Raz won from the guild, and i will attest that this is not the case. Domination loot rules where everyone present rolls, which means he's had to roll against everyone who thinks they need the item the whole time, so he got 90% of his items from elsewhere.<br>
 <br>
 Lets talk about Epic's while we are bashing people. Seems i saw severene camping RF far less time than the rest of us, I recall severall members like Barridor asking where Sev was when its his camp? I heard claims of him playing during the days, but never saw him camping it, so why bash other people's morall character when yours isn't that amazing.<br>
<br>
 Now as for this &quot;guild policy&quot; about the blade, how is it i was an officer before your day, and never heard anything about it? Was it a pollicy only held by those who where present on the raid? Why wasn't it posted? Why wheren't the other officers asked about it? I agree with the policy, sounds great, i would have supported it &quot;if&quot; i knew about it.<br>
<br>
 Things i will say for raz: He supported the guild(by no means did he carry it). He showed up on every raid he was online for. He lead tons of raids(not an easy taskt). He replied to people, and gave possitive input, not just neggative(points at sev). He may not be the greatest guy, he may be a loot whore, but he did way more for dom then u ever did.<br>
<br>
 I think raz should caugh up the sword and be done with it, but thats me. U post about titanias, and his arguments, but he's a RL friend of yours, and is never online for us to ask him personally about his version of the story.<br>
 <br>
 Severene u do a damn good job when u show up. U got your epic, and im glad u did, despite my disliking u, u deserved it. When your not doing dumb stuff on message boards, u kick ass bro. Everytime u touch the message boards though......<br>
Just play and have fun.<br>
<br>
 This post is intended to remind u that when u force people to make judjements based on facts that they dont know, your asking them to make biased desicions based on facts from one side of the street. My facts about u are undoubtedly wrong in many ways, but the fact that i layed them out here will raise people's brows. U should not have bashed him like this, it was a personal vendetta between u and him, as i have only heard word of this stupid sword from u and sighter. Sighter only talked to me because u pushed it into his face. I want u to know i lost all respect for u, i was just starting to warm up to u man.<br>
<br>
 I am not perfect, i make huge mistakes(sorry vanje gonna appologize when im done here...im a jacka##). I know u all resent me, but u will all live and do great. Theese views are mine, and mine alone. I want people to know that the person doing the bashing is by know means a charming little wonderboy with amazing character. He's a good guy, but his posts are outlandish. I dont know how he gets crazy on the boards, but is kool and reasonable in game<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
 To all of domintation I love u guys, your all great friends, but this crap isn't helping anything(yes i know my word is worth dog dookie now that im not in your guild). I wish the best of luck to u guys in your merger with PC. Stay kool guys.<br>
