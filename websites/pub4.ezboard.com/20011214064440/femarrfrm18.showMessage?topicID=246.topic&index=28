For the first one about Lurikeen.  What I said was a challenge to him.  We have both been butting heads for a while now but respect each other at the same time.  He has recognized that I have spoken with substance and I have recognized his statements as having substance as well.   Abotu Xamael and who ever I flamed about atheism etc...  What I intended to exemplify(and certainly did btw) was painting a picture of his future reality.  Very naturalistic.  This whole time my point has been recognizing feelings as being just as important as thoughts.  YOU and others have flamed and challenged me.  And thats ok <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    I challenged you as well.  Especially Xamael and Muzaak/Lurikeen   Heck and you too.  It doesn't mean I have somehting against you or hate you.  I respect you for your substance more so than most so-called 'christians'.  I noticed that you were eager to post when you had a chance.   I think you prob just read over htings too fast and misunderstood.  I understand because I said some very rude shit to Xamael especially.  I knew he would think it rude and gettting that reaction out of him proved that he regarded his feelings at that moment as more important than his thoughts.  If his htoughts were moer important he would not have been pissed off.  (Lurikeen is a proffessional at this I might add)                                                         And about hitler and all the 'bad' people.  My point about things being 'equal' is because I don't believe that me being a relatively 'good'(whatever that means) person makes me better than anyone else.  I think under the right circumstances all of us can do some haneous shit.  Now would i kill hitler if he wanted to hurt peps like he did.  Well I guess I would do what I had to do.  Yea he was a piece of shit.  BUT it DOESNT matter what I think or how I judge.  DONT take my comments or words or anyone elses screw things up for somehitng else.  Example:  The stupid shit all the peps in all those different 'religions' did throughout history and still to this day.  Fuck them.  I don't claim my knowledge of God as coming from them(THOUGH I can honestly say that Lurikeen/Muzaak has helped me spiritually, and thats NO SHIT)  He will prob laugh his ass off when he sees that.  Did you see that Lukaria said that he didn't think I was hepling christianity(not in those exact words)  Hehe, yep like I said in earlier posts I have thrived on having soo many different types of friends.  I have learned much from all of them.  And it has made me a better person.  Anyway, I have to go.  And trust me.  90% of what you said was taken out of context.  Things I say are meant to be communicated to certain peps.  As I have developed an understanding towards them and they of me.  I wouldn't say the exact same thng to you as I would Lukaria Xamael or Lurikeen.   I don't think you would either.  Anyway, gotta check my auctions on the board and stuff.  BTW I'm thnking about your offer for MVBH. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showMessage?topicID=138.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showMessage?topicID=252.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.emailToFriend?topicID=246.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.threadControl?topicID=246.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/deleteThreadFire.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=246.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=246.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub4.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="emarrmessageboardrules">Message Board Rules<option value="emarrlinks">Links<option value="emarrupcomingmmorpgs">Upcoming MMOG's<option value="emarrfrm16">The Emarr Quadrant<option value="emarrfrm18">America Under Attack<option value="emarrfrm19">Dark Age of Camelot<option value="emarrgeneral">General<option value="emarrfrm17">Funny Stuff<option value="emarrbazaar">Item Bazaar<option value="emarrscrollsnspells">Spell Bazaar<option value="emarrfrm15">Shiny Things<option value="emarrfrm14">Bargain Basement<option value="emarrdragonsandplanes">Rants and Flames<option value="emarrfrm13">Dragons and Planes<option value="emarrroleplaying">Roleplaying<option value="emarrroleplayingoocforum">Roleplaying - OOC Forum<option value="emarrscammeralert">Scammer Alert<option value="emarrsignaturecorner">Test Forum<option value="emarrreallife">Real Life<option value="emarrothermmorpgs">Other MMOG's</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#E9D756>- </font><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/bemarr>Erollisi Marr, The Queen of Love</a><font color=#E9D756> - </font><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18>America Under Attack</a> <font color=#E9D756> - </font><br><br> <br>
