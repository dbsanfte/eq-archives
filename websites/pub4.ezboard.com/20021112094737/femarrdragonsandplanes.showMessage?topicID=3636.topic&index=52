Where as you hardly play the game, refuse to raid, and like to start meaningless arguments in Rants and Flames? I don't know if you know it or not, but as time goes on, guilds can and do change their focus to be more of a 'raiding' guild than a 'casual' guild and sometimes vise versa and they also expect their members to either contribute(within reason) or be dropped like the dead weight they are. I guess no one sent you that memo, perhaps they had a point not to.<br>
Oh well, doesn't matter much now.<br>
<br>
Perhaps I suggest you change your name to Kano. You know, like the guy from Kung Fu. It's more suitable than Chiteng since in this forum and in game - you stand alone.<br>

When a guild officers chooses to harass a guildmate, simply because he doesnt like him, he is no longer a legitimate guildmate. He is merely an irritant.<br>

Chit, if you by your own statements have not been active, and therefore a non-member for 6 months, how could you have ANY clue as to what is going on in CE?? If you say people are talking to you in email, name them. I know you'll have a reason not to. A lot happens in a guild's life in 6 months. Political climates change, people come, people go. So you really have no clue as to what you speak in regards to the current status of CE. <p>Langree<BR>

<br>
It is so easy to blame someone else for your faults and it is easy to scream fowl and deny that you did anything wrong when things don't go your way. If you want an example, scroll up and reread your previous post about 'the cleric having more pull than a monk.' Wah, @#%$ wah.<br>
<br>
Ask yourself why Hopp said the things he has said, ask yourself why Dews isn't too happy with you either. And don't give me that bullshit about people ganging up on you. If you really cared about the MEMBERS of CE, you would realize that your actions as a person in game and on any forum, reflects on them as well, but since you're stuck in the mentality of 'you vs. the world' I don't think you deserve to even use that word. You may have had the tag on your character from a previous 'merger', but based on your actions you sure as hell do not deserve to keep it.<br>
<br>
On second thought, my advice isn't worth a lick of salt as I am sure it is falling on deaf ears. Continue your witch hunt, crusade, or whatever you want to call it. I now know why I do not come to this board anymore; just like this post - it isn't worth the effort. Sure I am bored, but I'm not bored enough to sit here and read about the injustice brought unto you, oh Lord Martyr of Eternal Hardships.<br>

Guild structure is a Monarchy. You have a leader (king) and his officers (vassels). The nice thing about the guild is that unlike in RL, you can LEAVE if you dont like it. Or they can throw you out if they dont like you. Its the way it goes...<br>

why he harassed me. YOU assume he had a good reason. That is YOUR assumption.<br>
I do not share it. By allowing him to harass me Til effectively says to the entire guild 'If you cant get along with Hoppkins LEAVE' <br>

We dont have the same value set, or life experience. His opinion is that of a teenager. If Til wishes to feed Dews ego, again that is Til's problem.<br>

Nope...I don't condone it, nor do I condem it. No Idea what this harassment was. was it something you concider harassment and others dont? or was it something that would make sailors blush? since all I know is that you called it harassment, I must judge that you concidered it such and will refer to it further as &quot;Chiteng Harassment(tm)&quot;.<br>
<br>
&quot;I have not seen Hoppkins post<br>
why he harassed me. YOU assume he had a good reason. That is YOUR assumption.&quot;<br>
<br>
Nope...never said that. I dont assume he had good reasons. and I dont assume he DID NOT have a good reason. I actually didn't even think about his &quot;Chiteng Harassment(tm)&quot;. and to be honest if I saw Hoppkins post here about why he &quot;Chiteng Harassment(tm)&quot; you, I would be surprised. He might harass you in other ways, but honestly, isn't that why you come here?<br>
<br>
&quot;I do not share it. By allowing him to harass me Til effectively says to the entire guild 'If you cant get along with Hoppkins LEAVE' &quot;<br>
<br>
No, that is YOUR assumption. did Til tell you to leave? if so I stand corrected but to this point, you are telling us that Hoppkins &quot;Chiteng Harassment(tm)&quot; you, and therefore since Til did not in a public way chastise him for it, you feel it is guild policy. That brings us back to the Monarchy thing. He dah king, he makes dah rules. and he makes the exceptions to the rules.<br>
<br>
now for you. You are correct. You can say anything you want. No one is stopping you (though from previous posts, quite a few would love too.). The point is that if you wanted to actually create a better situation, you would be doing this on the guild forums working within the guild. This is where you could of actually made progress. If you just wanted to Poop on them, then you would do it here. So I must conclude that you just wanted to poop on them. In this case my original statement stands. <br>
<br>
I have played with CE before. IMHO They have always treated me fairly and with honor. I have played with Dews on several occasions, and Hoppkins just once, but never have I seen anything other then good playmenship from them. So I again repeat my support of CE, my lack of support for you  and will stop here. <br>

Every guild has its favorite people who can get away with more @#%$ than other people. Every guild.<br>
<br>
If you don't like your place in the guild, leave it. If you choose to stay you are accepting your place. In either case complaining because of favoritism is totally immature. <br>
<br>
Favoritism exists at some level in every organization of more than 2 people. In most organizations there is nothing you can or should do about it other than accept it or try to improve your standing in the pecking order.<br>
<br>
But some people are too self centered and self righteous to accept this and they try to change it. Stirring the pot in game will get you deguilded. Stirring the pot in real life will result in much worse.<br>
<br>
We are all people. People get along with some better than others and we all let it affect our judgement to some degree. Ooh, ahh, a guild pandered more to a raiding cleric than a self-serving-no-raiding monk.<br>
<br>
What exactly were these guys giving you crap about anyway? Your lack of supporting the guild? Your self serving, self righteous, no one else can be right attitude?<br>
<br>
I would say CE is better without you but it sounds like CE never really had you anyway. The only link between you was the tag. Doesnt sound like you will be missed or that you will miss anything. <br>
<br>
One thing is for sure, you wont be getting in any guilds after this post. But thats okay, I am sure you are happly being unrestrained by all the rules that only applied to you.<br>

I suggest you go to Yahoo, make a dummy account for e-mail. Post the address<br>
on this board. I will send you copies of every e-mail I have ever sent to the CE leadership, trying to reslove this issue. They will be DATED copies.<br>
<br>
You assume that my first reaction is to flame on this board. You are dead wrong.<br>
My first reaction was to tell Ninya IN GAME at the time. She told me to talk to Til.<br>
After the raid was over I wrote Til on the guild board. I sent copies to other guild leaders. That is what guild policy SAY YOU SHOULD DO.<br>
<br>
But of course no action was taken - that I am aware of. That is the key thing,<br>
I must be made aware of it.<br>
<br>
If you actually have an interest. The argument has been going on in guild for at least 7 months possibly a year.<br>

I do it in real life also, I wont stop just because you think I should.<br>
It isnt fair or democratic to play favorites. If that is how it will be, that<br>
should be stated at the door. Not left for later once someone is commited.<br>

I didnt say 'guys' I said 'Hoppkins' a bit of a difference. The reason I refused to raid<br>
is that Hoppkins took each attempt at participating as an excude to try and find<br>
an excuse to complain about me. By refusing to raid, I avoid that problem,<br>
seems simple enough to me. The reason I wasnt raiding was because of that cleric.<br>
Solve the problem with the cleric and I will raid. Seems again very simple.<br>

You cant expect a man my age to agree with the type of decisions you make.<br>
They wont. I suggest you try that at a job. You go tell Bill Gates that your opinion<br>
is more valid than his. Try it at IBM, you will be lucky they dont escort you to the door. On second thought dont try it at IBM, IBM has a managerial blacklist.<br>
I would not wish anyone on it.<br>
<br>
You got into this affair because you support your freind Hoppkins. You dont actually know anything about me at all. I admire loyalty Dews, but your freind <br>
did and was harassing me. Dont ask me to admire him. When you jump on the bandwagon you should look where it is going. By flamming ME you violated the exact policy that you claim should be enforced. The policy doesnt say<br>
'unless your an officer' it says NO MEMBER. That means YOU.<br>
If you dont respect your own policy, you cant expect anyone else to. You should know that by now.<br>
<br>
I might have taken @#%$ from Til and Ninya because 'I RESPECTED THEIR OPINION'<br>
YOU dont rate. You wont rate until you do something which I respect. period.<br>
That you have not done, nor are you likely to. <br>
<br>
Maturity is more than some 19 year olds opinion. When you are 30 you will realize that.<br>
