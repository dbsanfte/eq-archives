See that is why I envy Ogmuk. He is able to be grey.<br>
I am only able to see black and white.<br>
<br>
But there is more too this story than what is posted here.<br>
Much much more.<br>
But it is all about a guild that no longer exists.<br>
The player no longer exists. Sure his twinked level<br>
exploited 4 extra characters still exists and they are<br>
still being used, that much is true.<br>
<br>
But you see - to me every player that benifited from<br>
this guy - who KNEW what he had done to get that <br>
level, they are no better than he is.<br>
<br>
To put it in Mistress Ezra's so elegant terms,<br>
They are no more than that players bitch. And they were. Day after day they would wait for him to log on<br>
fighting over who would get to group with him.<br>
At the same time they expected to have other players respect them in game for their 'accomplishments'.<br>
<br>
What a joke. What accomplishments? They demean <br>
every honest player. Yet you still see people in threads say idiocy like this - 'well you may not like guild XYZ but they got shit done!'<br>
<br>
No they didnt. All of it was made possible soley by this<br>
guy cheating. And you all worship that. Great you do that.<br>
<br>
Every player who reads this, who didnt exploit or cheat<br>
to reach whatever level he is at, remember that quite<br>
a few of the high level UBER players you think are so great, have very questionable origin.<br>
<br>
Also the fact that he was NOT the only cheater.<br>
ALOT of people found out how he did it and eventualy<br>
even Verant - slow ass coders - changed the location.<br>
<br>
I will admire Naru and Oggie. They didnt cheat or exploit.<br>
Naru beat me in a fair contest. cest la guerre<br>

Never exploited, to my knowledge. But, I have an opinion, and much like the old adage goes, by the faint lingering scent of assholes on this thread, so does everyone else.<br>
<br>
Cheating when it hurts or hinders other people is wrong. Period. Not if. Not when. Not with the exception of. Wrong. It's simple. But, (this is a big but) you can't compare cheating on a MMOG and cheating in real life. You just can't. Would playing QuakeIII using God mode reflect cheating? You're invincible, one hit kills. etc, but you're not effecting anybody.<br>
<br>
But, the glory, and destruction of multi player games is that they're designed around competition. So, if you played PvP, and had a way to kill someone without them defending, that would be wrong. Everyone would contend with that. &quot;Cheating&quot; by using terrain effects to kill mobs faster doesn't effect anyone. I think it's stupid (severly stupid) of Verant to ban people for doing that. They should code it differently. If someone uses it, change it. Don't punish them for your own incompetance. That's just childish.<br>
<br>
The problem is, Chiteng doesn't notice the difference between cheating when it helps you, and cheating when it hurts others. Sure, killing a mob that got stuck in a tree helps you level faster. But how much faster? If it's not extreme, it isn't going to be that detrimental. If it is, Verant will fix it, like Vendrix said. The simple fact is, is that someone raising levels faster than you isn't so terrible that it warrants such a long grudge. It doesn't effect you. At all. <br>
<br>
But, no one is Chiteng, and no one has a right to tell him that he can't hold a grudge, because frankly, he's right, and as many insults as you use, it won't change that fact. As much as you can tell him to forget about it, it's in the past, you can forget about him, and not read his posts. <br>
<br>
The problem is, is that Da'kor has never been able to stand criticism. Maybe it's the inflated ego's, or the false sense of pride. Vendrix lets it roll off of him, as does other Da'kor members, but if you see anyone question Da'kor/Magisters integrity (and judging the recent UI/Mag fiasco, is limited at best) it's like a swarm of angry hornets, screaming for their lost pride. It's pretty sad. So Da'kor/Magister, If you want Chiteng to forget about it, practice what you preach. Forget about it. <br>

<br>
Vendrix and Kuzic: I think both of you have forgotten<br>
alot about being less than level 60, certainly less than<br>
level 50.<br>
<br>
One CRITICAL skill that NO other player UNLESS he is the<br>
same level as a grossly high level player could do:<br>
<br>
IF I were a cleric and level 50 in a group of say level 34-40, I could rezz them when they get killed, prot them<br>
to try and prevent that, Buff them to help speed things up, use the un-nerfed manastone to never run out of mana,<br>
and reduce downtime, and use a very simple overlooked spell that is rarely used any longer - 'Strike' to single pull mobs that the group can just barely handle.<br>
<br>
The ability to single pull a mob makes ALL the difference<br>
between getting the SSOY and dying in a train of BOK<br>
(or whatever.) It would not even matter if one or two<br>
people died as long as the MOB died.<br>
<br>
I admit it has been a LONG time since either of you<br>
played for an extended period in the mid-30's so<br>
I dont think you were dissembling. You simply forgot.<br>
<br>
Yes in TODAYS game things would be at least slightly<br>
different, but that was then.<br>

<br>
i've played with some of the best clerics (imo) this server has had to offer.  dedicated and determined, knew their class in and out, knew other classes in the way they related to the cleric class.  determining what class would need what and when compared to other classes.  you know, the clerics who made the class an art form, something to be watched in awe and wonder.<br>
<br>
remdar, was the first of these i had ever seen, and i have yet to see his skill matched.  note, this doesn't mean it hasn't, it simply means i've not witnessed anyone who i would say was as good, as consistent, and as tolerant, as remdar.  <br>
<br>
this is absolutely no knock to the other clerics on the server.  again, i've been close to the legendary ones that go down in emarr history.  and they deserve their place without doubt.<br>
<br>
but in my opinion, he was the best.  not because he was high level, and not because he had the awesome gear, but because he paid attention to his class, knew what he wanted it to be, and made it that way.<br>

Let me just ask you this... were you ever the benefit of this high level res, at any point in your EQ career, or did you turn it down on principle? I think I can safely say it probably saved you a long walk more than once, and you clicked ‘YES’ with little protest. Therefore, I now declare you an accessory after the fact to exploitation!<br>
<br>
Manastone wasn’t nerf’d, it still does the same thing it did when the first one was looted. It simply got zone restricted and since no one was doing exp in the planes and we’re talking pre-expansions, it’s really a moot point. <p><b>Vendrix</b><br>

<br>
I want to thank you Vendrix for asking that question.<br>
So many of you people claim you do not understand<br>
why I bear (what you call) a 'grudge'<br>
<br>
Once upon a time:<br>
After a spectacular interpersonal conflict with Tzzird<br>
in HK, I stopped grouping with the 'group' of people<br>
that clustered around Remdar.<br>
<br>
The reason was that I felt that the level penalties<br>
favored Remdar and that the risk was increased.<br>
I was correct as far as 'mechanics' go BUT wrong<br>
as far as 'politics' go.<br>

At that time there were ONLY 4 high level clerics.<br>
Leiran, Remdar, the dwarf with ICE whos name I still<br>
cannot spell, and Haruna.<br>
<br>
Haruna was limited because she was in Japan and<br>
she also liked to exploit.<br>
<br>
Leiran was usually with either HoD or Fyrnis/Oggie/Naru<br>
<br>
Remdar was usually w Tzzird <br>
<br>
So in simple truth I had screwed myself.<br>
Oh well =) <br>
Because you see, any monk that wanted to group<br>
with Ogmuk's group had to contend with their rather<br>
bizzare treasure policy. <br>
I.E. all monk drops go to Naru and if he doesnt need<br>
old equipment THEN and ONLY then do you get it, and<br>
only if he gave it to you.<br>
<br>
Naturally I didnt like that policy. I think I grouped with <br>
them all of three times. But you see I made the mistake<br>
of POSTING my disagreement. Oggie/Naru never forgot that.  Allow me to ask - how many of you would put<br>
up with such a policy?<br>
<br>
In any case I used a similar solo technique to what is used now in solB killing goblins in HK to maintain my<br>
lead in levels. However I didnt have a pet shaman<br>
who logged in at the same time I did and who would<br>
take care of me. So my lead over Naru steadily <br>
eroded. After a period of time (4-6 weeks not really sure)<br>
I realized that it was difficult if not immpossible to<br>
progress any longer w/o a cleric. So sadly I was forced<br>
to send Remdar a tell one day, telling him that I realized<br>
that I had been wrong. I expected to get blown off or be<br>
on ignore, but he was quite affable(as Kanya noted)<br>
and he said 'I have heard you have a few issues concerning me and I would like you to voice them NOW'<br>
<br>
So we talked about training newbies in HK and the generally poor attitude of Tzzird and Teuvas w regards<br>
to lower level players (Tzzird was on vacation at this<br>
time, I didnt know that, but he was)<br>
<br>
You see once you are outside a group, it is much easier to see how people percieve it. That group was a bunch<br>
of heartless bastards in HK. I learned later on a different<br>
server that HK had been BUGGED, and that the XP<br>
given in HK was three times what had been intended.<br>
I dont know to this day if that is true, but we sure made<br>
ALOT of xp there.<br>
<br>
In any case Remdar and I hashed that out, and a couple<br>
other issues,and then I asked this:<br>
&quot;I have heard from some druid freinds of mine that you<br>
have been exploiting in Feeroot. Is that true?&quot;<br>
he replied,<br>
&quot;I get that shit all the time. I have been grouping with<br>
Shinjo and Khitas in lguk&quot;<br>
so I said,<br>
&quot;So you have not exploited in feeroot?&quot;<br>
(like a complete newbie, I didnt even know at that time<br>
WHAT the exploit in feeroot was, it was just words to me that people had used to describe what they saw<br>
Remdar doing)<br>
and he said,<br>
'NO'<br>
<br>
Like the idiot newbie I was, I believed him.<br>
Until 3 months later I ran into Justicia, Lexi and their<br>
group. Who shared a few intresting stories and SS.<br>
But that is another story for another day.<br>
<br>
So yes Vendrix I did get rezzed by Remdar several times.<br>
He lied to my face and I believed him.<br>
So dont ever ask why I dont like him.<br>
<br>

*bullshit* *bullshit* *bullshit*<br>
<br>
You bitched about Naru all the time, simply because he was your main competition to be the first monk to 50, and because Leiran was 'his' and not yours. You hated him and you hated me for grouping with him. Your behavior was far from rational, and I would appreciate it if you would refrain from twisting words/events to suit yourself. Fat chance, I know. <br>
<br>
concerning Remdar, you said:<br>
<br>
&quot;All of it was made possible soley by this<br>
guy cheating.&quot;<br>
<br>
/laugh<br>
<br>
I wonder which personality of yours wrote that one...<br>
<br>
Please, list the names of people who 'bunched' around Remdar. You seem to think that him making 50 several weeks early by 'sploiting spectres somehow enabled the rest of the high level population to accomplish feats and gain loot that they otherwise would not have been able to, and that is simply untrue. There were simply not enough high level people to do anything much in a dungeon at that time, and frankly Remdar didn't hang out with very many people anyways. From what I remember of Remdar, he played at an off time, solo'd all the time, and grouped with Tzz when he could and rampaged in Unrest with his paladin. If he helped Tzz or others with levels it may have saved them, what, 2 weeks? I spent many hours with Tzz and Teuvas going through the 40's, and *rarely* would we be accompanied by Remdar, or any cleric for that matter. They put in hard *time* to gain their levels and gear, it wasn't handed to them by the Magic Exploit Fairy like you enjoy trying to make it seem. What about all the dozens of people Remdar ressed at the lguk zone, are they now Accessories to Exploitation? Book'em Chit! <br>
<br>
It was no secret then, and shouldn't be one now that you hated all the high level monks, and have a specific grudge against Teuvas/Tzzird because they kicked you out of their group. <br>
<br>
The picture you are painting now is, to be fair, inaccurate, and to be biased, total bullshit. It just goes to show what you are really all about. It is the same now as it was then. Practically the entire high level population detested you then, to your face or not. Isn't that why you went away for so long and came back when the new batch of players didnt know you? <br>
<br>
And yes, I remember all the good things you did for people too Chit, you spent hours retreiving corpses from befallen, you weren't greedy, and you were loyal in your own strange way. However, it is a shame that you will forever be in my memory as one of the most irrational and 2-faced people I've ever met.<br>
<br>
One day I hope I will be cool enough to have my own thread too. /gag<br>
<br>
I think Gerome said it best when he said 'FYITGA'. So FYITGA Chiteng. And yes, this use of Shrinerism is officially sanctioned. <br>

To defend myself from Tristra on this board I would have to bring up issues that frankly (although titilating I am sure) are best left not brought up. I would be forced<br>
to quote from conversations that were private and<br>
proprietary. I would have to post e-mail and SS etc. etc.<br>
And for what? None of you actually care. None of you<br>
have an opinion to change. DaKor no longer exists.<br>
There IS a story there but I was not a member.<br>
Let someone who WAS tell that story.<br>
I will just sit back and be happy about it.<br>
I will assume that it was destroyed by the competing<br>
egos within it. If I am wrong oh well no is telling me =)<br>
<br>
At some point someone MUST finally act like an adult.<br>
<br>
So Fine Tristra You win. Wave your victory about.<br>
I wont go there.<br>
<br>
There is alot she feels I dont know, that I do.<br>
Quite likely alot that I also dont. I have answered<br>
her as much as I am willing to below.<br>
<br>
Some people refuse to show restraint when they are angry. Some people will stop at nothing trying to validate<br>
themselves. If Tristra wishes to do this type of thing<br>
I cannot stop her. However I 'can' refuse to respond.<br>
<br>
I do not hate her and in a perverse way I always<br>
wanted to help her. 'For fellowships sake' I used to think.<br>
Obviously I must have failed. So many things attempted and failed.<br>
<br>
What can we say was accomplished by this thread?<br>
We can say that it is generally conceeded now by most<br>
ex-DaKor people that yes indeed some players with questionable methods were included in their ranks.<br>
Most of them say 'So What?' They helped us, they were<br>
good comrades, so shut up.<br>
<br>
Remdar was just one player. I knew him, but not well.<br>
There were many more. Most who I didnt know. They are still out there. <br>
<br>
To say cheating doesnt harm us, to me is false.<br>
If I am alone in this, then I am. I pay money to play this game. I wish I could say that the other servers I played on were different. They were NOT. They were all the same. All the petty competing egos all the same.<br>
Erollis is a paradise compared to Torv (my opinion.)<br>
<br>
If it doesnt bother you that the person you may be<br>
grouped with didnt spend the same amount of money,<br>
time, effort, to reach the same level then I envy you.<br>
To me its almost WORK to grind my way up another level.<br>
I resent people who get an easy ride.<br>
<br>
I should have listened to Mitch when she said:<br>
'They all know that already. Your not telling them<br>
anything new, all you do is irritate them' <br>
She said that just about a year ago. Smart girl.<br>
<br>
So I doubt I will post anything more on this thread.<br>
<br>

Bitching isnt the same as posting Tristra or havent you noticed? Can you find a 'post?' no I dont think so. <br>
<br>

******************************************<br>
You bitched about Naru all the time, simply because he was your main competition to be the first monk to 50, and because Leiran was 'his' and not yours.<br>
******************************************<br>
I dont think Leiran 'belonged' to anyone. But suit yourself.<br>
<br>
***********<br>
You hated him <br>
***********<br>
actually no, dislike is a better word. and even months after the event Naru and I would speak to each other.<br>
Something that for example Tzzird and I did not.<br>
<br>
*****************************************<br>
and you hated me for grouping with him. Your behavior was far from rational, and I would appreciate it if you would refrain from twisting words/events to suit yourself. Fat chance, I know. <br>
*****************************************<br>
Actually Tristra I felt sorry for you as I told you on several occasions. Because I felt you were a good<br>
Monk and you were forced to adhere to that<br>
'Naru first' treasure policy. But it was that or have no groups at all so I understand your choice.<br>
As for casting history in a favorable light, I think when you decide to not do that I will consider your request.<br>
<br>
<br>
******************************************<br>
concerning Remdar, you said:<br>
******************************************<br>
Actually I didnt mention Remdar in that post at all.<br>
That is your supposition. I dont feel obligated to defend<br>
something I didnt say.<br>
<br>
<br>
******************************************<br>
Much about Remdar deleted true or untrue not important<br>
******************************************<br>
A synopsis of what she said:<br>
<br>
She conceeds that Remdar may have cheated.<br>
She asserts that it doesnt matter and had no effect.<br>
******************************************<br>
OK Tristra you have stated YOUR opinion. Thats great.<br>
<br>
******************************************<br>
It was no secret then, and shouldn't be one now that you hated all the high level monks, and have a specific grudge against Teuvas/Tzzird because they kicked you out of their group. <br>
******************************************<br>
Really? So you choose to ignore Toadhammer, Jacko,<br>
Shadon, Lyra? Or you are saying they were not 'high'<br>
level monks? I am sure Shadon reads these posts.<br>
Perhaps he can say if he felt I 'hated' him.<br>
<br>
As for what happened with Tzzird/Teuvas, Tzzird himself has posted his version endless times on this board.<br>
I dont feel the need to rebute you.<br>
<br>
<br>
******************************************<br>
The picture you are painting now is, to be fair, inaccurate, and to be biased, total bullshit. It just goes to show what you are really all about. It is the same now as it was then. Practically the entire high level population detested you then, to your face or not. Isn't that why you went away for so long and came back when the new batch of players didnt know you? <br>
******************************************<br>
MY MY, with a server population in excess of 8k I must be a very great villian indeed to be as hated as you say I am. I wonder what I could possibly have done to be so hated. Greater than even Lucas or Inix or those two <br>
morons that duped rubicite and flooded the server.<br>
<br>
Strange that I had not noticed. Yes I did leave.<br>
Yes I did come back. But no I have never claimed I was retired, and still haunt the boards looking to flame people.<br>
But since you are aware I did leave, why do you say I could not cut it on diffrent servers? Login to Torv and I will show you my monk some time. (also ECI and Nameless) and I didnt twink them. I am not afraid to TRUELY start over. As for pictures being painted,<br>
dont look too closely in the mirror Tristra.<br>
<br>
<br>
*********************<br>
you weren't greedy<br>
*********************<br>
Try telling that to Tzzird. After all he claims I ninja<br>
looted a black book w silver runes. (why I would do that is truely beyond me)<br>
<br>
<br>
******************************************<br>
One day I hope I will be cool enough to have my own thread too. /gag<br>
******************************************<br>
No Tristra I dont think so(at least not one I start)<br>

 Lumpy let me clarify what Mitch was trying to say to you in his first babble.<br>
<br>
-- &quot; I was talking with Vendrix, who unlike you can and does validate any opinion he holds and can communicate his thoughts clearly.&quot;---<br>
<br>
 What shes really trying to say to you is ..<br>
  <br>
--I was just trying to make Vendrix respond me , so everyone will think that Im cool and make people think he likes me.--<br>
<br>
 And as for his second line of crap.<br>
<br>
 Who the fuck cares if Lumpy or anyone puts in their opinion on a thread that people make public. Mitch sure dont have a problem with giving his opion to everyones posts atleast not that I have seen.<br>
<br>
  Hell I dont even know Lumpy, But I have had more run ins and dealings with Mitch than he knows in my time in EQ.<br>
  And befor you get in to saying who the fuck are you and ll that jazz. Ill just tell you this.<br>
<br>
  I frist met Mitch with my second twink I think it was and you were Kill stealing me while you were 4 levels above me. I will never forget that. Thats how I remember you.<br>
 <br>
  It was in Highpass and you were being a prick.<br>
<br>
  He will probobly say &quot;You freak Highpass was always FFA&quot; <br>
  Well i got news for ya when I leveled my first character in EQ that zone was always packed but guess what people shared, because people knew that relationships with others players were more important that ganking them and being a over all prick. <br>
<br>
  EQ has changed alot since all these kids have gotten their mommys to buy them Everquest on thier Target card. This server has always had the best people in it IMO. I stayed after comming from Rallos when Emarr came Live because of the good people on it. But people like Mitch have always made me shake my head. <br>
<br>
  As for the other dealings I have had with Mitch`s shady ass this post would get to long and I dont care enough to type it all out. <br>
<br>
  But in my time Ive seen alot of the people on this server go from level 1 to 60(along with their twinks), from the time Emarr came live till present. I basicly quit or have been taking long breaks since befor Kunark. But I still hang around sometimes. I see whos good and whos a punk. Who is worth a shit and who is not.<br>
<br>
  And frankly Mitch has allways been a Greedy punk and has never been worth a shit. I honestly wonder how you have gained any friends in this community. Im just judging by my own personal run ins with you with differnt characters. Lord knows how many other people you had shaddy dealings with.<br>
  <br>
  But this is just my opinion feel free to flame away and cut and paste all you like. I rarely post.<br>
