I sat down at turbo speed and tried to mem a spell (the pages of the spellbook flew by as I turned) but I couldn't get the gem icon to go in it's slot.  I stood up, turned slightly and the world spun at turbo speed.  I took one step forward, ran 20 or 30 steps forward instead, fell into a lake that was quite a ways in front of me, fell to the bottom of the lake and then drowned in about 1 millisecond (because I drowned 20 or 30 times faster than normal).  I was then dumped to the char select screen, where my character was spinning and attacking 20 or 30 times faster than normal.<br>
<br>
The really strange thing is that I formatted my hard drive all of 3 days ago and freshly installed EQ.  My system is running normal parameters, nothing is overclocked, and EQ is the only thing on that machine at this time (besides Winzip, I think).<br>
<br>
I petitioned to ask a GM about it, and he said he'd heard of such a thing once, but then our conversation was rudely cut off by West Commons randomly disconnecting people.<br>
<br>
Anybody had anything similar happen ever?<br>
<br>
As a side note, ever since the last patch I've been zoning to char select or server a lot more than usual.  Anybody else notice that? <p><center><img src="http://members.rogers.com/keter7036/seredin01.jpg"><br><center><b><i><font color="darkred" size="2">Phoenix Crusaders, Erollisi Marr</b></i></font></center><br> </p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/udeviatorsouldriver.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Deviator Souldriver</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 92<br> <font color=#E9D756>(11/28/01 9:39:30 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Anyone ever had this happen?</span><hr size=1> smoking crack is bad for you <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><center>

I had no lag showing at the time, and my group reported that I had died so fast, they never even saw my HP bar move.  It went from full to dead just like that.<br>

<br>
I'm guessing that it may have something to do with your video cards and their inherent accelleration of graphics. <br>

I was in OOT yesterday.  Went to seafury isle, run up  and rooted a clops.  I backed off to cast a spell and the damned thing turns like its following something and begins swinging.  AND I start taking damage.  I am nowhere near this clops.  I can sit down, med, go thru my spell book and then BANG I get hit again.  At no time has my root broken nor has this clops moved closer to me.<br>
<br>
Well I decide to caution on the better side of valor and run(swim) back to sister isle to have the druid I'm with evac us out.  Well he evacs and I'm still there.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I then find out he says I'm sitting right in front of him in SRo.  I'm like &quot;WTF?&quot;<br>
<br>
I camp out to make sure I don't die by some sporadic lightning bold from the sky and when I return I'm still in OOT, but this time I'm on the damned BOAT heading to Butcherblock.<br>
<br>
I'm really confused by now and decide to find my druid friend and port to the mainland where things began to settle down and I felt comfortable that I wasn't going to &quot;fall thru the world&quot; or something.<br>

I had a problem in OOT last week twice...once one day and once again another day.<br>
<br>
First:<br>
<br>
I was in oot and saw that the Oracle was up. I went over there, made my pet, then sent a bolt to pull the guardian. What was weird was...the bolt didn't shoot from me, it shot from some other angle, from behing the guardian. The guardian ran towards the bolt but then he retreated back. My pet was near me, but wouldn't recognize my commands unless I was far to the right of him. I relogged and it fixed.<br>
<br>
Second:<br>
<br>
In oot again. I was on SF Isle. I shot a bolt and it came from another direction. I sat down, then did a /pet follow me, and the pet proceeded to go underwater. That was weird. I relogged, but when I came back on, I was on the stinking boat!! I got off on the nearest isle, gated and logged...after that it was ok. <p><img src=http://www.garlic.com/~hypatia/images/staff.gif width=405 height=36><br>

After getting a res from a friend (thanks Quistil!) I ported back to WC and ran into the WC funkyness (which I'm sure was unrelated).  I wasn't showing any lag at the time and my main system (which is on the same shared DSL line) was working perfectly with no perceptable lag at any time.  My girlfriend was on a Hole raid when all of this was going on and her system didn't burp in the slightest.<br>
<br>
The system this happened on used to be my main system, only now it has a GeForce2 GTS instead of a GeForce2 Pro.  It's by no means a new system, I just recently reformatted the HD and reinstalled Windows.<br>
<br>
Greywolfe, it sounds like you were lagging -- maybe although you stopped to root the mob, the server thought you kept on going and the mob started swinging at you.  I've had weird things like that happen when I'm lagging.<br>
<br>
But the most interesting thing to me about this speedup is that it happened on a clean system with normal hardware and no perceptable lag.<br>

I had to change/modify my IRQ settings for these devices.  One example was my sound was playing really fast but my video motion really slow.<br>
<br>
I ended up disabling every device and enabling one at a time then try EQ.  If it worked I would move to the next device and so on.  <br>
<br>
Once I was able to pin point that my on-board intel sound card was conflicting with the video card I disabled the sound card and it was fixed.  The speed is purely client side and not server side.<br>

The bushes and trees were swaying like mad, the mobs were walking at sow speeds, I was gaining HP like crazy.  And this is on my computer that has never crashed or had any sorts of problems (no IRQ conflicts), is not overclocked, and has nothing on the hard drive except EQ, Netscape, and Civ3.<br>
