      I was at that raid too.  Some did have problems but kept their mouths shut, for fear of being blacklisted.   But what do I know.  Regardless, he led a great raid and is a great leader.<br>

<br>
I was along for this one .... what happened was that the loot rules were posted where the raid was posted.  Problem was, when it came time to raid, a few people had backed out.  <br>
<br>
Brecht was seriously considering calling off the raid.  He stated as such.  What happened then is that a large portion of people apparently wanted to raid Vox badly enough that they started calling in friends and favors and we managed to get a last minute semi-workable situation set up.  <br>
<br>
That is something that no one seemed to notice or mention....Brecht was very nearly NOT going to raid...but he was asked to PLEASE continue.<br>
<br>
So, he went on about the normal course of things.  He was so busy trying to explain to the majority of the people there that had not been on a Vox raid (and several never on a dragon raid) what to do to keep folks alive so the loot rules weren't priority.  When we got into chat after several things already starting to go wrong...  <br>
<br>
    *** Yes, it was me that was killed in the buff hall when Vox aggroed there...so I'm pretty certain it wasn't a hallucination on Brecht's part***<br>
<br>
Brecht went over the basics and the specifics and then the loot rules.  As I remember it, as he said Okay....we are all here, any more questions...a few asked about the loot rules and Brecht even stated that we would sort out the &quot;special cirrcumstances&quot; after she was dead.  We logged back in and at least one group never got formed because there was a lot of shouting and ooc'ing over the loot rules....<br>
<br>
So, there ya go...I've even got the logs...was a pretty big night for this little bard and I'm glad I have something to remember it and all the really amazing people I met by.<br>

Quote:  what happened was that the loot rules were posted where the raid was posted	<br>
<hr><br>
When you call people in last minute how are they supposed to know what was posted?  They had no clue, they were told "hey we cant raid without X number of people who are able to provide X service in this raid, come help!  Were they supposed to say "oh wait, I gotta go look on the Emarr board and see whats posted first... because if I come I dont want to be eliminated from loot rolls?"  No... it wouldnt work that way.  In Kerna's raid tonight there was an issue with a friend of mine who was too low to roll on an epic piece... he heard of the raid and wanted to join, I told him "ask Kerna if you can come" he did... he was told yes... I didnt think about it, neither did he.  But when the issue came up I felt that it was my fault because I (knowing the loot rules) didnt advice him... it totally slipped my mind.  And because he asked to come (rather than being invited) I felt there was no reason to argue the issue with Kerna or anyone else...  because it was a whole different scenario.  This same player was included in the roll for the spear (actually two) so he was included somewhat... didnt win, was still disappointed, but I hope not too badly... because I still feel awful.  Either way Im hoping he had a great time and will be willing to try again... perhaps several times!<br>

I didnt want to go on much about this situation period... but Brecht went over all the "basics and specifics etc and during so told the people involved they were disqualified"  A few asked questions (mainly me because I was pissed) and with the situation at hand (the "Special Circumstances") it wasnt something that should have been discussed after... when I said "are they going to be able to roll or not" a simple "yes" or "no" should have been provided... there is no reason why that matter couldnt have been handled prior.  Atleast one group never got formed... I was never grouped, several people not in my group were never grouped... so it was more than one group.  Never should have charged until all groups were together and accounted for.  <br>
<br>
The loot issue should have been dealt with then... and that is no excuse for why we werent grouped... had we been grouped, healers could have healed their tanks, people may have survived longer, we could have had a successful raid... its possible... the last time I charged in at Vox she was at 10% I thought "wow we're gonna get it" but I didnt realize that at that time.. there was almost no one left.<br>
<br>
Either way... its over... its done with... the dragon didnt die anyway... no one got to roll on anything anyway... we lost... but we won.  <br>
<br>
my favorite song has a line that says "everything's wrong, but its alright" and hey... everything was wrong but... its alright... cant do a damn thing now.  No one was harmed.  Everyone is still breathing... its good... we will all learn from this experience I hope.<br>
<br>
Now...<br>
<br>
As far as the raid where Kerna won the book and the bag... this is how I see it... he had NO REASON to lead the raids after he got his book... tell me what was in it for him?  Yet he did several more.  And honestly... if he was after the loot or unjust with his loot policies why would he have continued to give YOU and all the others involved an opportunity to try again for the items that you desire?<br>
<br>
I dont know Kerna outside of his raids, but he did everything fine.  Im not defending him for any other reason than the fact that I have a right to my opinion... and what you see is my opinion.<br>
<br>
Everyones entitled to a wrong opinion... right?  <br>
<br>
And as far as having a problem and keeping your mouth shut... sometimes its a good thing to do (I should do it sometimes) but at other times you gotta realize that unless you say something nothing will be resolved.  I had someone in my group say "hey how'd he get to roll on both!?" my response was "he deserves it" and nothing else was said.  So yeah Im sure some people had problems with it... but realistically... do you think that this was such a big deal?  We all knew he was leading another raid, we were all invited... there was no reason to assume he was "loot whoring" to benefit himself... he got lucky... and thats it =P<br>
<br>
As far as being blacklisted... heh... yeah... I wouldnt want that to happen... Im sure it probably has happened to me... especially over this whole issue... I'll find out soon enough Im sure.  But either way... in several circumstances asking a question or stating an opinion isnt going to piss anyone off to that point... and if it does would you really care whether or not this person wanted you with them on further events?<br>
<br>
*shrug* I wouldnt... if the situations irking you cant be dealt with by X person why would you care if they blacklisted you?  They arent the only people on our server.<br>
<br>
So with that said and done... I hope I made a decent point.  Im tired... dont mind me.<br>
<br>
Just think in a week you will see me being flamed for screwing up a Vox raid *laugh* <br>
(it will go fine *wink* I have a great team backing me up)<br>
