<br>
toady I went over my Rl friends house, many of you know him as samel.  His brothers and mother also have characters on the same acct. I walked into his room and his younger brother mathew was playing his older brothers character who is named Fatara.  The character in question is a lvl 16 FEMALE erudite. I was jsut sittig on the bed in the room when I hear Samel's younger bro say something like man these guys are nasty. So naturally I ask him what is giong on. Now keep in mind that Samel's younger brother is a 11 year old boy, that jsut likes to play the game with his uber warrior :) Well to make things short he tells me that this guy darknight (IThink that is the name of the guy he was a human shadowknight if Iremember correctly) is being quite lude in some of his comments, and naturally I think oh what is he donig the normal flirting that some of us do to the females.  Well I find out that he has jsut made a comment that the group should gang up and rape fatara.  As soon as I saw this I made Mathew leave the group and I petitioned and reported him, unfortunetly by the time i saw it the battle spam from the area had gotten rid of the phrase.<br>

All I have to say to this guy is, you sick little bastard. Why dont you think about what your saying on the computer before you put this kind of shit over the channels. This game is supposed to be fun and when people say shit like that it completely ruins the game for some people.  i wish i could have gotten the sphrase on the report that way it would have been one less punk motherfucker out there saying bullshit like this. Think about it you asshole! You jsut made a sexually harrasing statement to a fucking 11year old boy who at the time happened to be playing a female character. Then when i left the group you tried to appoologize and say if I dont accept it then too bad. Well you know what?Have a nice time trying to get groups cause your ass is mine now.<br>
<br>
For the rest of the community I'm really sorry but this kind of shit appauls me and needs to be dealt with. Just keep an eye for this guy and be wary if your a female character.  Sorry for the language, I deleted some of the text cause I didnt want to get flamed. So here it is my first shit listing...<br>

From reading Calten's post, it appears Nitemare already gave a very unremorseful apology, stating that it's &quot;too bad&quot; if they didn't find it adequate.<br>
<br>
I don't care if it's an isolated incident, you just don't tell a female &quot;hey, we should gang-rape you&quot;. Even worse if you're ignorant as to who is behind the character, in this case an 11 year old boy.<br>
<br>
Moderators, I hope this is one of those times where you choose the right to make your own judgements and let this stay.<br>

I say, keep this here, you're right. I know you tried pt petition, and since he isn't in a guild, I guess that option is ruled out. So I say, keep it here; this is just F-ed up.

I know its alot for gm's to sift through<br>
but 10 lines is hard to catch<br>
plus it can be misleading<br>
you might miss the lead into the 10 lines that are caught<br>
<br>
As for this guy, I stated my opinion before on the stoogie thread.  Its completely untolerable, and unsympathetic.  It shows a complete disrespect for people, and a crass mentality.  Im no sunday church goer, and I can get low down lude and crude myself(former rugby player, I will never forget the songs and limmericks).  However, if I happen to cross the line and I offend someone it really makes me feel bad, and I try to keep my bar room vocabulary to my closer friends.  I would never say accept or too bad, more like I hope you accept or in time you can forgive me.  Saying "too bad" shows that he really didnt feel he was sorry, after all saying sorry is not a cure the cure is meaning it and making sure it never happens again.<br>
<br>
This guy needs to remember not everyone playing this game are adults, kids are playing and its important not to corrupt them before thier friends get a chance to. its really not fair to thier friends.<br>
<br>
I know the defense for this guy is theres a filter, but I would bet that rape isnt a filtered word.  Even if it is filtered, hauling off and uttering something like that to someone is just disgusting. <p> <a href="mailto:dreamingwolfmail@home.com"><img src="http://www.fortunecity.com/bennyhills/flower/152/dwsig.gif" border="0"></a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon2.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uaustrianastarfyre.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Austriana Starfyre</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>w4nn4b3!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(5/28/01 6:00:03 am)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: nitemarelvl 16 Sk</span><hr size=1> /report is sometimes hard to use if there is any form of battle going around.

You said that this guy needs to remember that not all of us who play eq are adults, and there is a filter. Imho it doesn't make a bit of difference HOW old you the people around you are. You do not even JOKE about something like rape. I am an adult and I tell you if I saw a comment like that made around me I would report his sorry ass so fast his head would spin. People like that make me sick. It is comments like that that contribute to the desensitization of people to something truely horrible. In my experience, it is the same people that &quot;joke&quot; about rape that say to victims &quot;She was wearing a short skirt, she was asking for it.&quot;<br>
<br>
I personally have a mouth that would make the gnome pirates blush, but as you said Dreaming, I try to keep it to my close friends. The /filter command takes care of the &quot;naughty&quot; words, but the malicious intent still comes through in cases like these, it doesn't matter what words this jerk used, the intent and insensitivity were there.<br>
<br>
I lump this guy in the same catagory as the moron that started a character named &quot;Petofile&quot; and harrased people in zone, including a guild member who happens to be 16, when warned that he had been reported this ass created another character named &quot;Molestre&quot; and sent tells to same said 16 year old member and others. (The incident was reported several times and from what I understand taken care of quickly btw) My point in relating this story is that people like this guy and Nitemare are of the same cloth. They get some sort of malicious pleasure from &quot;joking&quot; about these heinous acts.<br>
<br>
I know not everyone would agree with me here, but I feel that injustices such as rape, molestation, child pornography, racism, and bigotry etc. are not to be taken lightly, these are serious matters and should be handled in that way. It doesn't matter if the person sitting behind the keyboard having to deal with people who can't understand that is 11 or 111, offensive and callous is just that.<br>

I use to think of this game as an escape from RL. But it mirrors RL too much. I am an adult and would be beyond offended and sickened had someone said this to me. The fact that is was said to a minor just adds a bit of salt to the wound. What is even sadder, is the fact that this nitemare char is probably young, which is quite frightening. What kinds of thoughts is this kid developing already. He finds humor in RAPE? God help those near him in RL! BTW to nite mare...since you find so much humor in rape, you may get lucky, end up in prison and find out just how hilarious it really is!  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ualundraadjani.showPublicProfile?language=EN>AlundraAdjani</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I live here.... get out.</span><br> <font color=#000033>(5/30/01 5:52:30 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://alundraadjani.com/otherstuff/eq/catface.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: nitemarelvl 16 Sk</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> This guy needs to remember not everyone playing this game are adults, kids are playing and its important not to corrupt them before thier friends get a chance to. its really not fair to thier friends.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Seemed completely remorseless &quot;Hey it was just a joke, I apologized, you guys are taking this too seriously and this is just a game, not real life&quot; seemed to be his defense.<br>
<br>
Didn't feel like soiling myself any further through contact with this despicable person. I suggested that he come here and try to apologize or something, but he really didn't seem to care.<br>
<br>
Rape is such a serious and vile thing, I can't see how anyone could joke about this--especially with complete strangers. I know many women that have suffered from sexual assault--sometimes it seems like more of them have gone through it than have been spared...and I know that if a single one of them had been the subject of this &quot;joke&quot; then they would have completely freaked out.<br>

Now I know you prolly are thinking, &quot;He's from a big city.&quot;  Well I'm not.  I live on a small island in Florida.  I understand how you would be upset but I do not think this is worthy to be on the Shit List.  I hear worse stuff everyday.  It's just normal.  Again, I honestly think this is not worthy.<br>
