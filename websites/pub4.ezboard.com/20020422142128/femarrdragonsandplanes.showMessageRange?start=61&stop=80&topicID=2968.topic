not sure how much longer this site will stay active, seeing as how its on an @home server which went the way of the Dodo. <br>
<br>
At any rate, it seems RAMBUS will have its day yet. It is just before its time currently.<br>
<br>
OEM manufactured crap (dell, Compaq, HP, etc) have made a deal with RAMBUS. The cost difference from DDRSDRam MB to RAMBUS MB is 1 Dollar. Yes, 1 Dollar. IF a distributor (Fry's, BEst Buy, etc) tells you different..they either dont know or are lieing.<br>
<br>
Prices on RAMBUS have been lowered, and the performance (which everyone knew was there, but didnt want to spend the extra money) seems to be making headway into the CPU's of tomorrow.<br>
<br>
I have RAMBUS on my P4 system at home, and thats all we use here at work. It most definitly is faster, but a month ago their sales were waaaaay down. Myself and others didnt think they would make it, like many other tech markets, but they proved us wrong. Oh well, thats technology.<br>
<br>
Anyways, Yep, I was wrong, and who knows, I still might be. Their manufacturing plant could burn down and they could all be out of business(or they could do the Enron thing). But after talking over some things with our marketing guys and calling some engineer friends over at Intel (yea, like they are gonna lie /snicker) it seems RAMBUS will be (hmm, hows it said?) teh $h^T .. in the near future. **This is based on information available as of 2-04-02.**<br>
<br>
I would (heh, I did) go with Rambus over DDRSD. The motherboards are easier to find with RAMBUS for the Intel Processor than DDRSD. AMD has alot more DDRSD than RAMBUS, but I dont like AMD. (their packaging sucks ass, as well as thermal issues)<br>
<br>
anyways..the pdf came from a platform conference in cali last week. More to be delivered at the IDF  next week. Look for some interesting stuff soon to be unveiled.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uchiteng.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Chiteng</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 435<br> <font color=#E9D756>(2/4/02 2:01:12 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2968.topic&index=62>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Darue</span><hr size=1> I just got the file, it was either slow or very large.

After this I read your other posts and simply began to solidify my opinion that you are in dire need of help. Paranoia and schizophrenic ramblings over various conspiracy theories does not indicate a totally healthy mind. I have affirmed this opinion of mine in responses to your posts when I see them head down the same road as those that went before. Of course, this is only my opinion.<br>

I'm just gonna hit some low points of your posts for the humor involved.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Your use in the post I am replying to, of the word 'Paranoid'<br>

<br>
Anyone capable of even a modicum of inductive logic can see that. You conceal nothing when you do it. Raedwulf does that on a constant basis. My assertion is that he KNOWS he is doing it and he does it WITH malice, because I refuse to acknowledge his 'correctness' He doesnt like being contradicted. No one does.<br>
Why is 'he' special? The answer is he ISNT special and he should learn to live with that.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I'm not trying to denigrate you by suggesting your posts describe some serious issues of paranoia.  I'm just stating a fact.  There are many alternatives to pointing out your paranoia (not surprisingly you chose the paranoid one, that we are trying to get people to ignore you).  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rolleyes --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/eyes.gif ALT=":rolleyes"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Trying to get you to realize the truth, and thereby stop this madness, is the one most of us have offered, and would appear facially valid.<br>
<br>
I'm not trying to get anyone to ignore you.  I'm trying to get you to ignore us.  There's no malice involved, just enlightened self-interest.  You clutter the board and annoy me.  Your departure would be nice.  It's really pretty simple.<br>
<br>
I'm so hurt that you would say I'm not special.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rolleyes --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/eyes.gif ALT=":rolleyes"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   My wife and kids think so, so your opinion is pretty flipping meaningless chump.  All your Napoleanic claims that you are special (we've never met anyone like you, you're from a different planet ... err ... era from us) are certainly reinforced by your &quot;put-down&quot; that I'm not special.  It's relatively common for people in your condition to accuse others of the exact problems that they face.  You fear you aren't special, so you claim that your opponents (or enemies in your parlance) aren't special.  It's rather classic actually.<br>

It's old now. For the love of aspirin, give up the holy crusade. The first time I read your post a few months ago against Da`Kor, it was interesting. <br>

I literally knew what this post was going to be about before I ever clicked the little blue text. It's going nowhere, and you're going to get the same results every rant. You'll make an accusatory statement, that member will respond, 2 other Da`Kor members will respond, a few people will post images saying you're gay, and I'll say something stupid and the thread will die. Rinse, repeat. <br>

Why should that scare me when I know it to be untrue.<br>

<br>
Chiteng, you refuse to accept what anyone has to say because, according to you, they aren't saying what they are saying.  You see things that aren't there.  Try reading what the sentences say and not what you think they mean.  I have never been afraid to speak my mind (just ask any of my guildmates) so there is no reason to read between the lines.  Of course, since I'm not who I say I am, I don't expect you to believe me because I AM OUT TO GET YOU! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uchiteng.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Chiteng</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 439<br> <font color=#E9D756>(2/4/02 4:57:27 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2968.topic&index=70>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Carathos</span><hr size=1> Ok Carathos A direct challenge.

Chiteng, your posts on this board are downright eerie.  I once knew a 14 year old with some serious emotional problems, and he just couldn't ever stand being wrong.  Listening to him argue was a lot like reading these posts.  A whole lot of rationalizing and word games, and not a lot of sense to his twitching rants.<br>
<br>
If someone killed a friend, I would be on them 2 years after the fact.  If someone destroyed my life, I would be on them 2 years after the fact.  If someone spited me in game, or destroyed my toon... I would tell them to fuck off and move on.  I personally think it would be great of Nuldar banned you.  I have yet to see you make ANY comments that contributed to the dialogue of the message board in the year I have read it.  Banning you would just be a Darwinian &quot;Thinning the Herd&quot; move, and totally justified. <p><center>Malevant Faeshadow<br>Speedbump<br> <br> Officer of the Free Company<br><IMG SRC="http://www.unicorntrad.org/three.jpg"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uraedwulf.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Raedwulf</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_thatch.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 600<br> <font color=#E9D756>(2/4/02 5:13:08 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2968.topic&index=74>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Wacko of the First Order</span><hr size=1> Please point to an &quot;admission.&quot;  Please try not to translate it into Martian, first.<br>

Sure, go ahead with more of your self-delusional conclusions.  You've stated over and over that you think you are special and unique.  I've even cited two of such references.  You continue to say you are better than us because you have a moral imperative, inductive logic, hyper-space trans-warp, etc.  Your claims are belied by your own words.<br>

Yes, we can both be right, since we are saying completely different things.

Yes, I finally pulled an old psych profile of someone and recalled the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory with one of its ratings on the Psychopathic Deviance score.  Just because I did not immediately recognize the abbreviation means absolutely nothing.  In school and in my cases, its been anecdotal evidence that has been the most useful in understanding a condition, not some sterilized test score which would mean nothing to a layman or a jury.<br>
<br>
Your fixation upon the MMPI is more evidence of your unhealthy obsessive personality.  Just because a real shrink would use a certain tool, and all I used was an analysis of what you've said in these threads (which contain lots of evidence of both paranoia and schizophrenia, but insufficient basis to provide a PD score), doesn't mean anything.  I'm sure if you sat down with a shrink (and I continue to recommend that you do so), he'd come up with a score putting you within the category of &quot;needs a lot of fuckin' help!&quot;  I think that's the clinical definition.<br>
<br>
