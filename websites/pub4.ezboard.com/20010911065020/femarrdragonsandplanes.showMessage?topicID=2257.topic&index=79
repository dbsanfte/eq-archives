Is that because you haven't fabricated them yet?  I would think if you had friends, especially family, regardless of level, you would have directed them towards this message board so they could proclaim how wonderful you are.  Don't see that happening yet pal.  <br>
<br>
Valric, you seriously need to seek mental help and I believe you might have a slight obsessesion with myself and Sagemone (but who could blame you there <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  .   You seem to miss all the other people on this thread and many others who are stating things you've done, things you've said and are spelling out basically why you're one of the biggest wastes of space to ever grace this game (and that's quite a feat given some of the nutjobs out playing.)<br>
<br>
If you're not going to leave the server, could you just shut the fuck up and go skip down the trail so we don't have to hear from you. <p>Tormentcia

I can see how easily you can confuse obssession with a rebuttal. It is very hard to tell the two apart.<br>

No, the reason why I do not ask people to come up here to stick up for my name is becasue then in turn all it will lead is to you trashing them as well, just because they are assosciated with me. I mean look how many people came up and stuck up for what they saw and all you did was call them stupid ignorant fucks and how could they be so blind.<br>

See........hmm what to say....<br>
<br>
I estimate the age range of Valric (or whatever multiple personality he has) is around the age of late teens mid 20s.<br>
I give him credit for actually being proper in his post. Correct spelling, grammars, etc etc. Not many Scammers/Bad Rep Arsehole can do that.<br>
<br>
Sagemon. He is an honest guy from what I have seen. Understandable where he is comming from. Great guy. Mistake happens, let the man live <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> . Stop gnawing on him! Very nice guy though. Proper too. I liked how he talks in groupchat. Proper english <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
SoD has a lot of honest people. Those that have posted. I trust their words. Syano couldn't be Valric because Valric will never get in a guild.<br>
<br>
Inferno's Hand. Keep that stuff going! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  This person needs more beat down.<br>
<br>
Visnet(sp?) never met you or anything. (I think) But, Visnet shouldn't get his arse chew off. He was just stating what was happening during that time frame in EQ history. He probably never have met Valric. So give him a break. Visnet is just being honorable and stuff...something that many people in this world have lost. Honor<br>
<br>
Valric...that name..oh yea Valric = gimpish 20 year old with a state of mind of a child. AKA GIMPAGE <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
Valric, I'm not going to flame you about the PoG thing because I wasn't there. You may have done an honorable thing or ACT/PLAY. Whatever. From the experience of all the people in this post, friends, guildmates, etc you are a total asshole. Just give it a break and go away or something..I have never seen anyone IG say anything nice about you. Everytime I hear your name it always accompany by &quot;this guy is harassing me about me training him when he was level 9&quot; or &quot;this guy trained me&quot; or some thing like that. You have proven to many people on this server of your ignorance, greed, prickish attitude, etc. <br>
<br>
Oh personal experience. I rarely have any interaction with you. But when I came into Kael and seeing you insult my guild, shows how childish, idiotic, prickish you can be. I think everyone had a great laugh when I offer you a Mage Version of a TL and your sarcasm wasn't that funny. Sending me a tell /msg Linare You know I am fully buff and stuff. Proves that you have a really big ego. You will never win against me in a duel. Oh yea, zoning to different zones and /shout Linare just married XXX send tells congrating her, constantly shows you must be bored, stupid, retarded(no offense to handicaps), a gimp and complete loser.<br>
<br>
You can always flame me. Doesn't have much weight from someone like you.<br>
<br>
Alright, Love ya all <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Linare, Arch Magus<br>
&quot;tis a life we live tis a world we hate, so let us die in peace and forget that we were ever awake&quot;<br>
<br>
P.S. The age thing wasn't implying anything. I was just guessing his age range. 87% right 13% wrong <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I love how the subject changes when he gets stuck.<br>
<br>
I never once said I'd get you banned, buttmunch.  I simply suggested that you leave quietly and let the rest of us live in peace.  No, I don't have to EVER deal with you.  I know how to walk away.<br>
<br>
As for Kith, that is NOT the subject of conversation.  I choose not to go there with you, because to do so is futile.  You have your own twist on things.  You have your mind made up that you have done nothing wrong.  And I am not going to put myself in a position where I have to defend myself against unfounded accusations.  Why beat a dead horse?  Enough people are flaming you for other things.  I see no reason to go there with you, Valric.  I'm trying to be as kind as possible.<br>
<br>
Now, if you insist on flaming ME when I haven't done jack crap to you, and implying that I am NOT the original, or whatever the hell you were trying to say, then you've started a fight.  And I HIGHLY suggest you be prepared for it.  You have no basis for your accusations and are just trying to turn this around on whomever you think can't take it.<br>
<br>
Don't you realize that with every post, you are making more enemies?  Do you really think I care about your imaginary &quot;high-level friends&quot;.  Do you think it scares me?<br>

Don't agree to something then point the finger at me saying, you are an asshole becuase we are a small guild and we agreed to join with you to accomplish the same goal, but your still an asshole and it's your fault. <br>

As for Linare, I do have some friends in your guild, and a few people I talk to. I was not meaning to make fun of your guild, and am sorry you took it that way. What was it that your guild said when you offered to TL me, your way? They laughed and pointed at you and said watch Linare die. But hey, I already got one from someone else so sorry.
