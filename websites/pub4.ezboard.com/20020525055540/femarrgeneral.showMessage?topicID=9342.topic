This meeting is a follow up to meetings and postings held since February.  Details of those prior meetings and postings may be found at <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://emragefire.tripod.com.">emragefire.tripod.com.</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END-->  <br><br>At various times throughout the evening there were between 10 and 30 players participating or present in the chat channel.  Numerous guilds were represented.  There is a link on the foregoing site to this roster as well as a link to the log of the meeting and several annotations.<br><br>The issues discussed and resolved were:<br><br>1)  Level Limit for List Eligibility.  <br>2)  Verification that a cleric is at the RF stage.  <br>3)  Whether or not winning slots may be traded/sold.  <br>4)  The mechanics of how the random list will function.<br>5)  Time limit for cleric to engage before RF is FFA.<br><br>The attendance and participation indicate that this is an issue which players on EMarr truly <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>     want</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> to find a way to deal with bottleneck for the cleric epic as well as the problems added by the Skyfire spawning of Ragefire.  Disagreements are inevitable - but the willingness to hang in there and talk these through to find what works for the majority speaks volumes for the players on EMarr!   This Consensus may need further revisions as time passes and we attempt to work with it -- but it is a beginning that all participants should be proud to have been part of, regardless of what the future may hold on this issue.<br><br> <p><img src="http://www.maclem.com/images/sefa/sefa.jpg" width=89 height=159><BR><BR>Sefa Akajira<BR>High Priest, 60 Seasons<BR>Proud member of Clan Autumwood<BR>”No, I can not SOW or teleport!!!!”</p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/usefaakajira.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sefa Akajira</A> at: 4/13/02 9:36:52 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/usefaakajira.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sefa Akajira</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 90<br> <font color=#E9D756>(4/6/02 3:46:09 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrgeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=9342.topic&index=1>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Ragefire Consensus</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE CENTER START--><center>  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  Ragefire Consensus</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></center><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><br><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><center>  as amended by meeting of April 5, 2002</center><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><br> <br>A chat channel meeting was held on April 5 to discuss open issues/problems with the Consensus reached at the Town Hall Meeting on March 8, 2002.  As a result of the discussion at the chat channel meeting, the Ragefire Consensus is amended as follows:  <br><br><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  Bold</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> text indicates changes:<br><br>1)  Spawn of the new Skyfire Ragefire. It was determined that the spawn of RF now occurs at  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  randomly every 72 hours</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>  <br>2) Despawn of the new Skyfire Ragefire. It is suspected that the human Zordak Ragefire does NOT despawn. It can be confirmed that he will not despawn within 2 hours (which is the longest he has lived on our server so far). The dragon Zordakilus Ragefire will despawn after 30 minutes. This last point is a matter of great concern. The only failed Ragefire engagement in the last few weeks showed that he despawned immediately upon losing aggro after he had been up for at least 30 minutes from the end of the battle. It is suspected that for as long as he was aggro on someone, even when outside his timer, he remained up; when aggro was lost he despawned. The end result of this being that once the human is killed and the dragon is spawned, the engaging battle MUST be successful or the spawn goes to waste.   The foregoing is still unverified as of April 6 meeting.<br> <br> 3) First Motion. Before proceeding to review proposals, some principles were stated and fleshed out. The Town Hall unanimously agreed that any RF system should be cleric-based and not guild-based, in order to give a fair shot to all clerics, guilded or not, and to all guilds who have several clerics meet whatever criteria (regardless of how many clerics they have in wait).<br>  <br>4) Second Motion. For the same reasons, base criteria of eligibility for the spawn were proposed and voted upon. The Town Hall unanimously agreed that in order to be eligible for the spawn, the questing cleric must be at the final stage of their epic quest. <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  Clerics will be included on the list if they are submitted by an officer of their guild, who is vouching that the cleric is at the Ragefire stage.  Clerics who are unaffiliated with any guild may fulfill this requirement by submitting the names of officers from any guild(s) which assisted them in acquiring the Burning Scroll from the Overking in Chardok.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>  <br>5) Third Motion. Again in the interest of setting base eligibility criteria, the Town Hall then took up a vote for level cap for eligibility. The concensus determined that <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  level 51</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> should be the appropriate minimum level requirement.<br>  <br>6) Fourth Motion. With all the proposals on the table, with all the tweaks and amendments and good and bad that were commented upon or introduced, the motion was taken up to vote upon a system. The narrowed-down selections were: List, FFA, List/FFA, FFA/List  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  The majority concensus was determined as follows:<br>        a)  The allocation of the spawns would be based on calendar weeks, e.g., Sunday 12:01 am to midnight Saturday.<br>        b)  The first spawn of Ragefire would be FFA; any subsequent spawns in that week would be based on the LIST.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>    <br>*** It must be noted that at this juncture of the meeting, all had agreed that the Sagemon Lottery proposal was the most fair list arrangement due to its weighting factor. It was also very well known that although it was deemed to be the most comprehensive plan, it also had the greatest administrative overhead. In all cases, &quot;list&quot; in the final selection implied the Sagemon Lottery.<br> <br> 7) The Plan. With consensus reached, the following particulars were fleshed out:<br>a) In order to be eligible for the Ragefire spawn, the questing cleric must be level <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  51+</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> and have completed the Ixiblat Fer/Overking portion of the Cleric Epic Quest.  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  An officer of the cleric's guild must verify this or, if independent, an officer from any guild which assisted with Overking.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br> <br>b) Each eligible cleric is issued a number, and that number is randomed in lottery to determine the cleric who is up. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>   For each random in which a cleric remains eligible he/she will receive additional lottery numbers.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br> <br>c) The cycle of the lottery will be one week. Once a week, the lottery/list keeper will determine by random a list of four clerics in order who are up for Ragefire that week. This eliminates the need for the questing clerics to be online when the lottery is rolled. The list for the week will be posted to the EMarr board by the listkeeper.  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  Each week the random will select FOUR clerics.  Winning positions do NOT carry forward to the subsequent week.  Any cleric who had won but had not gotten Ragefire for whatever reason will be given another lottery number and be included in the random for the following week. </b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> This provision was implied in the original consensus but not specifically stated therein.<br> <br><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  d)  Winning clerics may only trade positions with another cleric who has also won a position for that week.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  E.g. Cleric01, for whatever reason, may trade his/her position with Cleric04 for that week.  However, in so doing, Cleric01 assumes the same position Cleric04 had held.  Under no conditions does it affect the position of any other holding a position for that week.  Example:<br>        Original Random:        Cleric01  Cleric02  Cleric03  Cleric04<br>        Traded Positions:        Cleric04  Cleric02  Cleric03  Cleric01<br><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  The listkeeper must be notified by posting on EMarr board, /tell, or email of any trades as soon as possible.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br> <br>e)  Each time a cleric loses in the lottery, they receive an additional lottery number the following week. This weighting system is the key to the proposal. No matter who the cleric is, an eligible cleric's chances of winning the next spawn increases with time. After 4 lottery cycles (4 weeks), even with the influx of more eligible clerics, a cleric who has been on the list for 4 weeks has a greater chance to win the next lottery.<br><!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Sefa of &lt;Clan Autumnwood&gt; has been nominated for the role of Ragefire Listkeeper. Sefa already wields her epic weapon, and therefore has no vested interest to abuse. Furthermore, it was made very clear and understood by all that the lottery list system depends upon a trustworthy and reliable list keeper. One accusation of loading the dice or unfair handling of the lottery results in collapse of the entire system. No one present attempted to block the nomination of Sefa, and all who spoke advocated her candidacy based on trustworthiness and reliability. Sefa accepted this nomination.<br> <br>9) Toxxulia Forest, an empty transit zone with a druid circle, wizard portal, and Luclin transport spire has been selected as the place for holding the lottery. The list will be shouted to zone and randomed. The lottery may in this manner be witnessed to ensure its integrity and accuracy by any interested party. Southern Desert of Ro, East Commonlands, and North Karana were not selected as viable venues, due to issues with zone crowding, newbies/rudeness spamming /randoms, etc.<br> <br>10) Camping Ragefire in Skyfire is unnecessary and gives no right to the spawn. However, the questing cleric must kill Ragefire within 12 hours of the spawn or it becomes an FFA mob. The Town Hall believes that because the human Zordak Ragefire does *not* despawn, this is a viable solution. Killing the human Ragefire out of turn, thereby spawning the dragon Zordakilus Ragefire constitues a kill-steal, with all it's implications.<br> <br>11) FFA <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  The first spawn of SF Ragefire in any calendar week shall be FFA.  All subsequent spawns in that week shall be reserved for the clerics who have won the random for that week.  Any list spawn becomes FFA if not engaged within 12 hours.  To allow everyone to know the status of any spawn of Ragefire, everyone is asked to post on the Emarr board when they have killed Ragefire.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br> <br> <br>...............................<br> <br><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  Notes: </b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> It is possible some provisions have inadvertently been omitted therefore this document may be edited at anytime to include data from the minutes of the meetings, or to correct mistakes in interpreting the data from the minutes.<br><br>To compare the former consensus with the amended one above, please visit <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://members.tripod.com/emragefire/ragefire_consensus.htm">members.tripod.com/emrage...sensus.htm</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br><br> <p><img src="http://www.maclem.com/images/sefa/sefa.jpg" width=89 height=159><BR><BR>Sefa Akajira<BR>High Priest, 60 Seasons<BR>Proud member of Clan Autumwood<BR>”No, I can not SOW or teleport!!!!”</p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/usefaakajira.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sefa Akajira</A> at: 4/6/02 4:30:50 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/utheodwynriddermark.showPublicProfile?language=EN>TheodwynRiddermark</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 275<br> <font color=#E9D756>(4/6/02 5:21:08 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrgeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=9342.topic&index=2>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ragefire Meeting 5/6 - Report</span><hr size=1> Sefa has undertaken a Herculean task.

As a general matter, the opinions expressed by the raiding guilds that attended the meeting were negative about the very concept of a lottery system.  Several of the larger guilds simply began to abstain from voting on anything.  When that happened, the whole thing became a farce.<br><br>The silliest moment came on the level limit discussion.  A vote was taken that was sharply divided among larger guilds that wanted a level limit and (for the most part) smaller guilds that did not want a limit.  Whoever was moderating announced that the vote was in favor of a level 51 limit (which is no limit at all) and that it was time to move to the next topic.  I stated that we needed to reach a consensus on the issue, and the moderator just said &quot;A vote was taken, the issue is over.&quot;  Sorry folks, but the server is not a democracy.  At that point, I left.<br><br>Ironically, Sefa entitles her report &quot;Consensus.&quot;  There was no consensus at the Town Meeting.  Stumpf of Affliction said at one point that the meeting was just a bunch of people trying to make rules that give themselves a free shot at Ragefire, and as of now I'm inclined to agree.<br><br>You can agree or disagree with my viewpoint on the meeting and on Sefa's optimistically entitled &quot;Consensus.&quot;  That really doesn't matter.  What <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> does</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> matter is whether the raiding guilds are going to abide by this plan.  It really doesn't matter what the smaller guilds and the non-raiding guilds think about this issue.  If the raiding guilds don't agree to this plan, it's dead.<br><br>So here's the question to Magister, Midnight Fury, Affliction, Divine Grace, Ring of Destiny, Phoenix Crusaders, Anam Kara, Crimson Eternity, Kaizen`X, The Grey Legion, Radiant Eclipse, and the other 5 or so other raiding guilds that aren't jumping instantly to mind: Are you going to abide by this system, or shall we just go FFA with the Ragefire spawn? <p>Sagemon Prayeth<BR>High Priest of Quellious the Tranquil<BR>A Twist of Fate</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/umardukduvalour.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Marduk Duvalour</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_lightning.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 56<br> <font color=#E9D756>(4/6/02 8:41:58 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrgeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=9342.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ragefire Meeting 5/6 - Report</span><hr size=1> Not sure if there is already a forum for this or not.

At this time the list only has four clerics who are lower than 56.  Therefore probabilities are heavily weighed in favor of winners being 56 or higher.   What is the concern?

I have friends in all of those guilds, and I'm sorry if some of the folks in those guilds are upset by that comment. It's still true, though. About the best you can honestly say is that there was a consensus among the smaller, non-raiding guilds in favor of a level 51 limit. The majority of the raiding guilds that voted favored a level limit. You mention that there were two absentions, and I think those were Magister and Divine Grace (whose representative expressed opposition to any lottery system at all).<br><br>As for why the level limit is a concern, I've already explained that at length. Go back and read my old posts. The current handful of Ragefire-ready clerics in the low 50s is not really the issue. You may recall that I proposed simply grandfathering those folks into the system.<br><br>But let's not get lost on the level limit issue. The real question is whether any of the raiding guilds are backing the current proposal. With the possible exception of your guild, Clan Autumnwood, not a single raiding guild has answered the question.<br><br>If the raiding guilds support the current proposal, it's going to happen regardless of what anyone thinks about the level limit. If the raiding guilds do not support the current proposal, it's dead in the water. So far, the silence is deafening.  <p>Sagemon Prayeth<BR>High Priest of Quellious the Tranquil<BR>A Twist of Fate</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/utheodwynriddermark.showPublicProfile?language=EN>TheodwynRiddermark</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 276<br> <font color=#E9D756>(4/7/02 5:55:03 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrgeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=9342.topic&index=7>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Response to Sagemon</span><hr size=1> And of course Sagemon has an important point.<br><br>I've been hoping for quite some time now to get an official statement from the top raid guilds, or at least get a chance to get their stance on it.<br><br>The only one I have had any personal contact with is Midnight Fury.<br><br>Theo<br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ulukariatrueheart.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lukaria Trueheart</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 166<br> <font color=#E9D756>(4/7/02 7:24:34 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrgeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=9342.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ragefire Meeting 5/6 - Report</span><hr size=1> Just a question:<br><br>Since the last meeting, hasn't the spawn been FFA?
