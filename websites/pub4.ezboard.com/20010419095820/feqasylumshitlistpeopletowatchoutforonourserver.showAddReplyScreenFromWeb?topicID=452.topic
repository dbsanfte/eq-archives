I'm actually quite surprised I haven't seen him up here already.<br>
<br>
About a week or so ago in Lake of Ill Omen, I was putting together a group outside the Front Door of the Sarnak Fortress. There were only two spots left in the group, and my ooc requesting members was answered quite promptly. Byars was perhaps the fifth or sixth person to send me a tell, asking if he could join. I replied &quot;Sorry, we're full up&quot;. He immediately replied back with something like &quot;OK, I've had it with all your lies.&quot; Naturally, I boggled a little. I asked him what he meant, and he said something like &quot;I saw your shouting for a group&quot; or something like that. I told him that the slots had filled up, and that I didn't need to listen to his shit, and put him on ignore. Not long after that, members of the group on the other side of the door were ooc'ing that Byars was training them and kill-stealing.<br>
<br>
A couple minutes later, our puller had pulled a sarnak to our spot. We engaged it, and I see Byars come running up, 2 more sarnaks on him, and he feigned death at our feet, as we were killing this lone Sarnak. Well, naturally, chaos ensued. We persevered and didn't lose anyone. Before I made any accusations or petitioned, I checked with my party to be sure that I wasn't completely out of my mind. Two of them had also seen Byars pull the additional sarnies, so I petitioned. Well, he trained us again the next time we pulled something. At that point, I ooc'd something like &quot;Stop training us, Byars.&quot; and removed him from ignore. Someone else shouted &quot;Yeah, he keeps training us too&quot;. He claimed that one of my party had asked him to pull, and this party-member denied it aggressively. So we made it clear in no uncertain terms that Byars was not to &quot;help us&quot; by pulling mobs to us. He acknowledged this, and trained us once more.<br>
<br>
I logged shortly thereafter, having received no response to my petition.<br>
<br>
Since that time, I have heard several (at least 4) different people shouting and ooc'ing complaints about Byars. That's why I say I'm extremely surprised he's not here already.<br>

I don't know if the crap he does is shitlistable, but since someone else stuck him here I'll post about my experiences. <br>
<br>
As soon as Byars joined us, he said he'd be leaving as soon as he leveled to 27 (he was 26 at the time). Guess it was nice to inform us in advance, but I still think it was pretty selfish. He then preceded to pull Sarnaks, and no matter how hard I tried I had a lot of trouble taunting them off of him (I'm a paladin, our taunting isn't that good to begin with, and I'm also a newbie so I'm sure there are some tricks I don't know about in this area). Most of the time people don't mind this, but he belittled me about it every chance he could. My personal favorite quote: he gets smacked down to 1 bubble of health, and uses his Mend to save himself. He then precedes to say: &quot;I love Mend. I also love tanks. Geez, Anub, is your taunt pathetic or what?&quot; Nice guy. Eventually I got fed up, and told him if he didn't like my fighting he should go find another group, because we were sick of listining to him whine. In response, he told me to &quot;control my PMS&quot; and that &quot;it's not too difficult to hit the kick and taunt bottons while you fight.&quot; Because, as you all know, paladins can kick. /sigh<br>
<br>
He's also a ninja looter. He would be on EVERY single corpse before it hit the ground, including the semi-rare Sarnak Gem Oracle when it came along. Didn't even ask if anybody else wanted to loot, in fact, he SCREAMED at the rest of us to turn autosplit off (he said it was so he wouldn't get encumbered, but my guess was it was because he didn't want to give cash away to us). Once he pulled two sarnaks, and he looted the first the second it died instead of attacking the second. When the group cleric told him to leave the corpse and start attacking the second sarnak, he says &quot;Oh, now you guys are gonna whine about loot too? Geez...&quot;<br>
<br>
Eventually, he hit level 27, and was gone in the blink of an eye. But by that point most of us were glad to see him go. Bottom line: Byars is a rude, self-centered little brat. Don't know if that's a reason to stick him on the Shitlist, but if you're looking for a pleasant gaming experience, steer clear of him.</font><P>Anubyssani Coochofsky<BR>

<br>
Forming a group at Front Door in lake of ill omen. I've been doing this for a day or so, getting nice xp, because I run a tight ship when I form a group. Someone left, and a member pointed out Byars as ooc/shouting that he was lfg. We added him, he ran into the fort. <br>
<br>
We start getting spam from him over and over "I get this loot right? Right? I get this loot. Can I have this loot?"<br>
<br>
I ask him what the hell he's talking about, when he comes charging out of the fort with 9-10 sarnaks. Feigns at our feet. We all die.<br>
<br>
Once we're all back, I make a comment about how monks are supposed to feign AWAY from the group when they overpull, and immediately get a "You know what? Fuck you, you whore."<br>
<br>
I clicked his name, clicked disband, typed /ignore, and have not had a problem since, other than when he's running around inside the fort nabbing other people's platform pulls. I have, in ooc and shout, heard a LOT about him though...but this was my particular story. </font><P><p align="left">

He then goes off with some other mental defective, and they attack a good NPC (the Ogre at the Inn). He comes running back to me because they are getting their asses handed to them, AND THE NPC TRAINS ON ME! I kill it, and see my Merchant faction get worse ( thanks, you pendejo!)<br>
When I ask him why he did it, he clams up, and his special education buddy calls me a Who** and a &quot;Bloody Bit**&quot; (this must be tough talk in England).<br>
Since then I've seen people abuse him for his buffoonery on OOC and Shout in the Commons.

Then he started telling me how his son's birthday is tomorrow and how much his son wants that ring etc.  I was tired, it was late so i gave in.  He logged onto his alt.  I thinK Darrius or something similar, i have him on ignore so i can check later and clear it up.<br>
He gave me 500 as a downpayment and put me on ignore....<br>
After i gave him a week he swtill had me on ignore.<br>
I talked to someone from his guild, and he said he would talk to guild leader etc.  but nothing happened.<br>
HE told his guild that he went ld and lost the money ( which i got from him in trade) and that he never got the ring.<br>
Well i got a screenshot of him and the ring equipped.<br>
But now he's saying that he bought it later.<br>

<br>
I, a Shaman, was with a full group and the Primary Healer (never CAN get a Cleric when you want one *grin*) and Byars with an adjacent group.  Just after a multi-pull fight, he ran up to me and said the usual &quot;SoW pz&quot; (why can NOT people spell things out properly? *sigh*), I explained I was very LOM and would do so when I could spare the mana.<br>
<br>
Well, we continued to pull and I continued to heal/buff, and in the next 20 min never managed to get over 40% mana, but Byars continued to /tell me every minute or two about the SoW.   I kept telling him when I could, I would.  He got more and more agitated and aggressive, becoming demanding!  I was at the point of telling him &quot;no&quot; and putting him on Ignore when, while my nose was in the stupid book following a big fight, my group yelled &quot;TRAIN TO US&quot;... I stood up and there was Byars at my feet, FD, and four giants stood over him... then looked at us.<br>
<br>
Three of my group died, myself included.  I KNOW I was trained because he did not get his SoW.... I can not prove it, but I know it;  no other reason for him to FD at my feet.<br>

Haven't seen him in Dalnir yet, but he seems to be making his way up there.  I know for a fact that unless you are like 40 or 50 Dalnir solo is a death walk('cept if you pull to the zone or tps).

When Byars joined my group, he not only informed us he'd be leaving when he leveled, but he also asked that we let him pull. He then began puling before we could even respond. That way, if any of us pissed him off, he could train us, FD, and watch us die. He couldn't do that if he wasn't the puller, at least not without looking like an idiot.(Obviously, he didn't say this, but judging from these other posts you can sort of assume that's what he had in mind.)<br>
<br>
Nice to see Byars is staying here on the shitlist - right where he belongs. Avoid.</font><P><a href=http://eq.castersrealm.com/players/view_profile.asp?Id=58418>Anubyssani Coochofsky</a><BR>

I was lvl 30 at the time and I'm an enchanter. I really hate him for it but training a Enchanter is kinda stupid because of Mez. I counted 12 sarnak's and that's kinda alot. I know I mem blured 4 before they got to the group and AoE mezed the rest and the group took them out in about 5 min. Then he trainded again and got petitioned by the 6 people in my group and 6 more in the group next to us at FD in Lake of Ill Omen. I would just like to say this guy Sucks the big one, and if he ever reads this and wants to duel just send me a tell, I would like charming him and attacking a high lvl npc and taking Screen Shots to put on my web page.

My friend complained to me sometime ago that this miscreant caled her a bitch and told her to eat shit and die when 'He was hunting SOMEWHERE in FM and obvviously dying. He sent balidy a tell to heal him.  When she asked where he was he gave her some dirrections that led her nowhere ( she was at loio zone at the moment ) and she coudln't find him.  He told her 'Use your track dumbass'.  After that she went back to loio zone calmly without trying to find him.  Obvoiusly he died, cause he sent her a tell calling her a bitch and that he hopes she eats shit and dies. <br>
Just an example.  I know it's not my story to tell, but i thought i still would share it with you.
