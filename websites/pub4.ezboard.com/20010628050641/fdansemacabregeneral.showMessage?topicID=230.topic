I'm not exactly the person to speak about requirements to join the guild but I can give a few words of advice. The main thing we are looking for is people of good quality who have a strong desire to be a part of our family. This means actively searching out Ashborne people to group with so that they can get to know you.<br>
<br>
I hope to see a bit more of you around Norrath now that we've met. And always keep a cookie in reserve to bribe Tinomen with. It works wonders. <p>Tunare bless,<br>

<br>
It was not only a pleasure to help my friends but it was great to meet more and new interesting people ).. Janelle, quite honestly, I was not sure if anyone took my request to join the guild seriously. For over a week, no one even replied to my request and I was hurt by that fact <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I want to join a guild that has fun together and plays smart. I always help others and if I get treated badly, it is hard for me to accept that in game. It is not right to have others be mean to someone that makes a constant effort to make others smile in the game quite often. There is nothing more that I would rather see than to have everyone in the game smiling because of something I did. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Either it be by helping someone get Soulfire or just making sure that they don't die by just sitting there on a close battle. It does not matter to me. I have spent countless hours buffing others at no benefit to myself just to be nice. Primarily with my Shaman and in the Oasis but still. I like being happy and helping others achieve what they want too.<br>
<br>
I know that just because of how many friends that I have in this guild that positive things will happen and I am just asking that someone take my request seriously and I will make every attempt to group with any of you if not all of you. In my opinion, a guild is more than just a large number of people, they are friends joined in a common goal or goals to achieve and be happy... Hopefuly many of you agree with me..<br>
<br>
I have known Tiny, Reprobus, and several others for the longest of time. I have known Reprobus since he was level 34 or less... Every time I would see him, I would always summon him a coldstone or a heatstone depending on my level at the time and our friendship grew from there. We faught in Cazic Thule together, SK, etc... He is a wonderful guy. Tiny... Well, he speaks for himself on many occassions because if he doesn't then he will just eat them <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I have not played with Tiny nearly as much as Reprubus but I have spoken with him a lot over several months and I really like him and how he interacts with many others in game. His ability to roleplay such a grotesque race is just hilarious to me <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  *Offers baby powder for that itch of his* )<br>
<br>
I just left the Lore Guardians because in so many words, it is falling apart. Deodrid, the EX leader stresssed himself out and he quit not only the game but also the guild leader position. Now all that is left is clicks within the guild playing together and there is no real unity and that was not good enough for me. Either we are a guild or we are not. Agree??? That had always been a problem with the Lore though. I just did not see it until recently when all I heard were complaints from one another, both in game and on the msg boards. I had just had enough. I want a positive guild that we can all grow and have fun with. *Ramble, ramble, ramble* ))) I will sign off here.<br>
<br>

Hiya! I've been away for the last couple weeks, thus nada Reprospeak.<br>
<br>
Personally, it goes without saying that i'd love to see ya jumping around with an Ashborne tag above your lovely (albeit evil and blue) head. As was mentioned earlier, the path to this involves spending time with Ashborne members and getting the family to know ya, and u them. =)  <br>
<br>
I'll certainly be speaking to ya soon in game and hooking up with ya often.<br>
<br>
And yep, u're coldstones have always been appreciated. Check out my roster page under Friends, made shortly after i joined the guild. heh =)<br>

<br>
Tee Hee )))  I have grouped often with the guild but I think that I may have messed up due to not knowing the new looting rules. I have played in LGuk from level 30 on up to where I am now and they never had loot set up to who ever needs what got what ever dropped. EVERY drop was lottoed to whom ever won the lotto, regardless of your class. I spoke with Tiny and Vyktor concerning my adventure in Karnor recently and I was concerned as to why I was not involved in getting any of the drops. I made my concern known and I am praying that my concern did not rub anyone the wrong way. I have NEVER till now played with anyone who gave loot away only to those that could have used it. That being said. I am sorry for my ignorance and maybe everyone can understand that I meant no harm. I just felt out of the picture at the time and did not know what to think about it and felt bad because all of the loot went to everyone else... If anyone wants to group with me, Rosey is camped in Skyfire and will be till I can get some spells. If anyone needs my help in any adventure, feel free to let me know, I will help if I can at the moment... <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I don't like being non guilded and I feel a sense of urgency to get into a good guild because it is very longely being alone in Norrath <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Maybe in the next couple of days, someone will decide what they want to do.<br>

<br>
I apologize for not explaining our normal looting policy better at the time in Karnor. I probably also confused the issue when I had mentioned that I was still looking for some Flayed Skin armor, which no one in the group could use personally.<br>
<br>
I understand your concern and think that it was just a lack of communication on my part that caused the issue in the first place.<br>
<br>
The way I prefer to handle loot is by need of the characters in the group at the time. Characters who are there and would use the item as more than a backup piece of gear get first priority.<br>
<br>
Lacking anyone who needs it in the group, I then like to consider planes level alternates of the current group as they could be brought along to a raid depending on the needs of the day.<br>
<br>
Then comes guild/alliance primaries who could use the item on a regular basis especially if it's a class defining item. Ex. My Silver Swiftblade which came from Mcruff et al.<br>
<br>
Lastly and for more mundane items that no one wants for use it is lotto among the group. Ex. The last few pieces of Flayed Skin armor that I'm helping a non-alliance friend obtain. If it drops in a group I'm in, I'll either lotto, or agree to buy it from the group.<br>
<br>
This is just a loose guideline and discussion among the group is always the final authority. In pickup groups, I do not expect them to follow all of my own guidelines. I express my opinion that an item usable by someone in the group who also desires the item should go to them. Any random loot is lotto to be disposed of by the winner as they see fit. <p>Tunare bless,<br>

So they can get a feel for the way we handle things within the guild. Don't expect any overnight decisions tho. The time spent getting familiar with the guild is necessary on both the guild side and prospective members side. An invitation is only issued when the invitee is practically part of the family anyways. We've done it this way since day one, and it is the primary reason we are the best guild in Norrath. In this time u may decide that Ashborne is not the guild for u. <br>
<br>
I hope it's not discouraging, but we don't offer invites to people simply because they need a guild and are friends with a number of people within the guild. If we did we would be much larger, and probably vulnerable to the same fates of many other guilds that have spun out of control.<br>
<br>
Most of us can tell u that gaining membership takes time. I spent 2 or 3 months playing alongside the good people of Danse Macabre (Ashborne pre-merger) before that fateful night in the Frenzied Ghoul's slimy murky layer when Vyktor offered my medding ass membership.<br>
<br>
I realized just how much better the game had gotten for me, both in my enjoyment of it and my performance as a wiz, during those months. I learned more about fighting as a group than i had ever learned in my first 30 levels. And was lucky enough to be doing it with the kewlest and most skillful players i ever met.<br>
<br>
And in the time before i actually got the invite, the sense of urgency to join had faded. Playing alongside them was a rewarding enough experience. A game that had grown rather stagnant, was more fun than ever when i hooked up with these folk. I had been friends with Utrie and Denaiya for some time, but an invitation isn't offered upon a recommendation. It's offered when it becomes a technicality. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

   *Hates admitting ignorance* What is AEOF??? I went over to take out what I thought was killing you in BW only because I was worried for your life. You were around a bubble of health left and for a caster, that is probably about 5 hps <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I felt very bad about interfering with them after you sent 6 group tells venting on my poor performance.

If you can spare me the time to explain what it is that you were doing, I would be very happy )))<br>
<br>
Jannelle sis,<br>
    There was no confusion about the Flayed Skin... I have just never played with a group or guild that did the looting quite as you all do it. I love playing by any of your sides also. I have always been a fan of a Necro Mage combo but hey, that is me ))) I can apprecciate the logic behind your looting policy and it makes complete sense but I am also trying to get some of my alts to a higher level too and it is that much harder for me if I don't have anything to offer them because of the fact that Rosey is a Mage and will most of the time be left out of the loot because of that fact. I can't give my Paladin a Caster robe or anything like that if a caster item drops. I need items that that class can use to excell to achieve that level to go on the big adventures that I really want to go on. I need those items as well. <br>
<br>
I first started my very first character as a Cleric... I made it to level 16 as a DE cleric and in the beginning, I had put no extra points into strength and at level 16 when I could start to use bronze, it was too heavy for me and I felt very sad because at that time, I knew that I would have to remake her. I then decided to make a Shaman instead that is now Suzy. * I never remade the Cleric for quite some time* I played Suzy till she was 26th. I then made Rosey and I fell in love with being able to do damage and be able to solo and excell even if I could not find a group. Rosey made level 47 before Suzy got level 32 starting at level 1 just because of the excitement of it all. Both characters then made more levels since then but then my happiness came from my Warrior and twinking her and just having fun from the melee side of the hourse. I was highly happy with Stephanie's performance. She was and still is one of the fires that keeps me happy. I know that I can log Steph on and just be a basic swing and kill kind of person and that is relaxing to me after playing casters for so long. I like playing my melee classes but the reason for saying all of this is that along with that, I need loot occassionaly to keep building on the class that makes me smile so much. I will accept your looting policy because if and when a Mage item does drop then I will probably want it<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I just would like everyone to be fair and honest when an item drops on if they really need it or not because I probably would scream for it <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Ashborne has always been very friendly to me and even Danse Macabre *Spelling, sorry* at the time. Yes, I realize that a guild decision takes time because of how important it is to make sure that that invitee is family too. I was the recruiting officer of my last guild, I had very strict policies too. All that I said to a few people so far is that it is lonely not being in a guild, Especialy at that level because seldom to people solo anymore and it is very difficult to find a group. I have given the impression that I want an invite now but the truth to that is that I am saying that I am very lonely and sad because of that. I don't blame any of you for taking your time with me to make sure that I will fit in. I am just a very lonely Mage that looks to be with friends and have fun. <br>
<br>
I am done blabbing for now.<br>

sorry i wasnt able to clarify what i was doing after the initial pull until i got the snare on the giants. no time to type coherently =) The pet went in after it landed and broke the herd up. thus couldnt aoe (area of effect spell)<br>
I was hoping to deliver 4 giants with 20% health as the final kill of the night. anyways, i was just experimenting =) Didnt mean to imply performance criticism, was just tracing back to when it went awry.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#a8a8a8><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/bdansemacabre.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=rosey>Rosey</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>   <font color=#000000>(8/29/00 8:04:13 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_sunglasses.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Guild invitation</span><hr size=1> I am going to remove my request to join the guild. <br>
<br>
The process was just too long and I was incredibly bored not being with a guild. I joined the House of Nalsir... They are a small guild with reasonable potential. I would however like to keep playing with you . I still have many friends and now, new friends in Ashborne. Jannelle is definately one of them <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Anyhow, I am notorious for leaving pages of msg's so I will stop here. Thank you all for taking the time to spend time with me. I had a blast ))) Hopefuly there will be more of those times to come in the future regardless of guild status.<br>

The House Al Nasir does not help each other out much. That is hard for me to accept. Regardless of reasonable potential, I want a guild that helps each other out so I will keep my eyes out for a better guild to join. I know that is guild hopping and is highly frowned on but if in fact this guild is all that and a bowl of cookies *Tiny*, then I am sure that my hopping will cease <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I now have the Sebelis key. That will expand my doors on grouping with more of you if you still want to consider me for an invite in the later months to come. It is a painful wait and I don't think that I will disband the House till such an invite is ready. Being alone was just too much for me. I get a bunch of loot for lower level twinking and my bank fills up too fast and I need someone to give it too. Tonight I destroyed 3 Lumberjack caps because I had no more room and was encumbered <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  That was very sad. <br>

Right now Rosey is in Skyfire, trying to get some spells so that I can be the Mage that I want to be. Being adverse is the key to most things and with no spells, I can't do much unfortunately. Msg me in game, I have a few spells for trade if anyone is interested. Upheaval, Spurt and the 52 Mage pet for now.<br>

<br>
Sorry House Nasir isn't working out. Finding the right guild isn't always easy. The first guild I was in &quot;Light of Norrath&quot; was really fun in the begining. Unfortunatly, it got to big, to soon and degenerated. I left it when the founder left EQ. I didn't going a new guild until level 46 or so. I was grouping with people from about 4 other guilds and felt like I would be choosing between friends if I picked a particular guild.<br>
<br>
I eventually joined the Unseen because of the unique RP approach. Unseen was also on great terms with Danse Macabre where Vyktor, Kalyne, Infernus and many of my other friends were. When Unseen and Danse merged to become Ashborne, I couldn't have been happier.<br>
<br>
So anyway Rosey, I'll be sure to send you a tell soon. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>Kirasha Alcedonia<br>
