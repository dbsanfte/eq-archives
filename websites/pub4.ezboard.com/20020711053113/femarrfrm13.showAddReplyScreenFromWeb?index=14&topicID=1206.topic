<br>
I did not send a tell to any member of Sacrum Mortis other than the raid leader.  At no point did I /tell or otherwise communicate to ANYONE any request to quit their guild etc etc etc.  I cannot be responsable for the actions of others, and one of the other people who was looking forward to coming may have done so, however it was without my knowledge or consent.  I challenge anyone to provide a screenshot or log of me asking any member of Sacrum Mortis or that raid to leave.  <br>
<br>
The tell I sent to the raid leader, when I first found out there was somebody on the raid was simply were they clearing the entire first floor or would it be possible for our raid to go up later and clear any mobs.  I did not ask them to leave, and I did not insinuate that posting plans here entitled us to the plane.  However the response I recieved was both rude, and immature.  All I announced was that my raid was canceled, unfortunately.<br>
<br>
However I wish to state for the record that the raid leader did have full knowledge of our plans, and organized her raid to frustrated our guild leader.  This was a deliberate act of spite because of their IRL problems.  I was simply disappointed that she felt the need to hurt everyone that was looking foward to going just to spite one person.<br>
<br>
Posting to the board does not entitle, I am in full knowledge of this and have never intimidated otherwise.  The common courtesy I was refering too was this:<br>
<br>
If I had been planning a guild raid and noticed that there was a posted raid scheduled for 6 hours later that same day, I would at very least email the posted raid leader and tell him that my guild was intending to raid, this would allow easy recheduleing and less hurt feelings.  Also if Sacrum Mortis had gone to the plane because thats what they planned on doing that day, and they got there first, I would be disappointed at the lost oppourtunity but not angry.  Neither of these conditions are applicable in this case, for the reason mentioned above.<br>
<br>
Again, I challenge anyone to produce any evidence that I sent any form of communication to anyone on that raid saying they should quit their guild or whatever else you are accusing me of.<br>
<br>
The fact is the only people I spoke too was one level 47 druid who's name escapes me I asked &quot;who is leading your raid on hate?&quot; he responded with the name of the raid leader, withheld here to prevent just such flames as I am being accused of.  I than asked the raid leader if she was planning on clearing the entire first floor.  As I have said before, the response was childish and immature.  <br>
<br>
Again, if such messages as I am being accused were sent to people on that raid on my behalf, they were sent without my knowledge or consent.  I do not think that the raid leader performed in an honourable fashion, however I pride myself on doing so.  I appologize for the actions of any person understandably disappointed.  I also urge people to take out private grudges in a civilized fashion rather than resort to the kind of spiteful nonsense that caused this entire mess.<br>
<br>
If you have any comments or questions to send me, my email is alderac@telus.net  I dont have a great deal of time to read the boards, so cannot promise to respond to the further flaming nonsense that is certain to be posted here, however I do read my email and will respond to anyone genuinely interested in doing something other than leaping to conclusions and slamming people.<br>

<br>
I never said "you" sent messages to my guildmates, that would have been Claydar.  <br>
<br>
You sent me a tell after asking Akirrah who the raid leader was.  Your first tell was that of "how dare you disrespect someones plans" bla bla bla, I replied with as much attitude as you gave me.  After several shitty tells from you I told you to get a life and drop it, and you carried on... then the @#%$ from Claydar started.<br>
<br>
<font color=yellow>However I wish to state for the record that the raid leader did have full knowledge of our plans, and organized her raid to frustrated our guild leader. This was a deliberate act of spite because of their IRL problems. I was simply disappointed that she felt the need to hurt everyone that was looking foward to going just to spite one person.</font><br>
<br>
I'd like to know what IRL problems you're talking about first of all, and what the hell do you know about our relationship in the first place and what gives you the right to express YOUR thoughts about it?  <br>
<br>
I DID NOT know of your raid, and even IF I did here's the deal... EVERY Sunday for the past few weeks our guild has gone to SRO in hopes to do a PoH raid, unfortunatly each week some other guild was either 1. setting up or 2. already up there.  This week no one was up there.  I did it to hurt no one.  I was personally disappointed to see that despite my mother's (your guild leader) attempts to get you tools to shut the fvck up and stop harassing me that you continued to do so.  YOU tools are the ones who started the shlt and you're the reasons why her and I (as guildleaders) had grief on Mothers Day.<br>
<br>
I, in fact, had my raid posted LONG before yours was posted so please explain how I deliberatly led my raid to 'hurt" anyone.  I, in fact, did not see your raid posted.  <br>
<br>
I'd just REALLY like to know how you can know for a fact that I knew you were raiding... and WHY the fvck you people get so much pleasure in trying to drag my RL relationship with my mother onto these boards... its NONE OF YOUR @#%$ BUSINESS.<br>
<br>
Seriously... our relationship in game or out has nothing to do with you, anyone you know, my guild, your guild, what I do, or anyone/anything else.   <p>Baroness Syldra Marlowe<br>
