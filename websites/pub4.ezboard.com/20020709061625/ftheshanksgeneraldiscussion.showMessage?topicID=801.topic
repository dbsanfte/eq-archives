The ravens, Hugin and Munin, rest silently on his broad shoulders. He is a paradox to the celebration that rages around him in the great hall of Gladsheim. He eats nothing while all around him feast. He smiles not while Tyr’s laughter echoes down the stone corridors. Ragnarok is coming, he knows. The Aesir are doomed.<br><br>I have seen the gathering of evil in the frontiers. The knights of Albion hide behind their piety, using it as a shield to hide their corruption. They cry out in the name of their God in battle, but visions of coin and conquest rule their hearts. I have seen their greedy hands clutching their bulging purses as the collection plate is passed. <br><br>The Hybernians are no better, whispering their majiks in dark wooded groves. The pointy-eared elves and their lurikeen brethren carry on as if they had not a care in the world. They have chosen to ignore the dangers of life; the impending doom that will, indeed, be the end of this world. By doing so they defy the Gods, and therefore their life is a joke.<br><br>The stench from these realms is a portent of what is to come. Ragnarok; the day of doom. They have begun to probe our frontier, even as we wage our wars against the Giants. I have seen their scouts probing the borders whilst their knights and druids gather; their banners flapping in our north winds.<br><br>It is for this reason that I tell you, it is no matter how we die, be it by the hand of the firbolg or the fire giant. What is, however, of great importance is how we fall. Even the bravest of us shall fall, indeed we all will die, but the heroes of Midgard will take a seat beside the Gods in Valhalla. <br><br>We have few choices in this life, but we do have the choice between yielding and dying. A heroic death is not a defeat, but a triumph! It is the brave warrior who laughs aloud while his heart is cut from his living flesh by his enemy. He says to them, “You can do nothing to me, for I do not care what you do!” They kill him, but he dies undefeated. <br><br>So we must gather and defend. The intruders must be vanquished from our realm, or we must die trying. At the first enemy sighting, a “Call to War” must be issued to all Shanks in the area. Those Shanks must immediately come to the aid of their brother or sister. The enemy must be slain at all costs, if Odin is to be granted time. There are NO exceptions…the call of war is absolute.<br><br>The 8 Laws of the Shanks<br><br>1. Never tolerate the intrusion of an enemy into our territory<br><br>2. Never show mercy to our enemies<br><br>3. Never ignore a call to war<br><br>4. Never deny a Shank a group spot unless you are in a full group of Shanks<br><br>5. Never profit in a trade with a Shank<br><br>6. Never deny a Shank in need<br><br>7. Never leave a Shank behind<br><br>8. Never disregard an order or command of your leader<br><br>If ye are still interested, make a Norseman and find us in the sacred land of our forefathers…hard at work. <br><br>A coward thinks he will live forever<br>If only he can shun warfare.<br><br>Brave men can live well anywhere.<br>A coward dreads all things.<br><br>-Morvran Manesson, Shank Assassin, Council of Elders <br><br><br> <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uiamwotan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>I am Wotan</A> at: 2/15/02 3:50:04 pm<br></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub4.ezboard.com/ftheshanksgeneraldiscussion.showPrevMessage?topicID=801.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub4.ezboard.com/ftheshanksgeneraldiscussion.showNextMessage?topicID=801.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ftheshanksgeneraldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=801.topic><img src=http://www.thesafehouse.org/~fricka/shanks/reply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ftheshanksgeneraldiscussion.emailToFriend?topicID=801.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ftheshanksgeneraldiscussion.threadControl?topicID=801.topic><img src=http://www.thesafehouse.org/~fricka/shanks/delete.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ftheshanksgeneraldiscussion.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=801.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ftheshanksgeneraldiscussion.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=801.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub4.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="theshanksgeneraldiscussion">Mead Hall<option value="theshanksprivatediscussion">The Back Room<option value="theshanksannouncements">Announcements<option value="theshankspermanentrecords">Permanent Records<option value="theshanksarchivedletters">War Correspondence<option value="theshanksthewarroom">The Stone Table<option value="theshanksfrm6">The Alley<option value="theshanksfrm7">The Painted Cave<option value="theshanksfrm8">The Seer's Alcove<option value="theshanksfrm9">Archived Threads</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/btheshanks>Shanks</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ftheshanksgeneraldiscussion>Mead Hall</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.theshanks.org">Shanks - An All Barbarian EQ and DAoC Guild</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.8<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
