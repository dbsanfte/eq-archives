<br>
Let me tell you why.<br>
<br>
PC has been &quot;run over&quot; on many occasions, we just don't come crying to the EMarr R&amp;F when it does happen because it's none of your business. <br>
<br>
PC may send one or two representatives to respond to some subject that has to do with PC, but we do not condone having all of our members adding fuel to fire because why? It's none of your business. <br>
<br>
Talk about respect. If you have an issue with someone/some guild, take it up with them, not R&amp;F.  Why? Because its none of their business. <br>
<br>
So far I have seen my name and many other names associated with PC that had nothing to do with this incident dragged into this thread and elsewhere. Bring a little rationality into the situation, talk to one of our elders, post on our forums and you may get a better response. <p><center><select name="mychars" size="1">

The only person that might even remotely deserve any kind of response from PC or it's leadership is the cleric in question, and that certainly doesn't need to be done on the EMarr forums whether it's the General board or the R&amp;F. <p><center><select name="mychars" size="1">

Did you argue this with the GM yesterday night, no you agreed to the terms.  You lost.  Do you have a right to be pissed? Sure.  Has ranting and flaming gotten you anywhere?  No.  Did PC lose too?  Yes.  Have they had the self dignity to be good losers, and not post 4 pages worth of crap badmouthing other guilds?  No, they haven't and I have more respect for them.  And for all of you that would badmouth me personally for writing this, I really don't care.  The members of any of the three guilds that know me will tell you that I am a very fair player and have gone out of my way to help them.

I'm currently at work and so cannot play the game, but I still think the Emarr public has a right to hear this.  If this is how these two guilds plan on treating the public at large, then the public should be made aware. If the people representing GL and PC yesterday had some respect, they wouyldn't be getting badmouthed here now.  Would they?  The reason PC wasn't perturbed is because they had no more right to take that spawn than GL did.  They were trying to muscle their way in as well. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/bemarr.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=freezingfists>Freezingfists</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 20<br> <font color=#E9D756>(7/26/02 4:13:20 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3495.topic&index=109>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> my thought on RF</span><hr size=1> I think if after RF spawns someone goes to camping him and they been sitting there for 5days (like alderac did) then a bigger guild ie. GLs or PC shouldnt just be able to waltz up when theres only about 1 day till he spawns and just take over.  I would think that any guild that big would have enough respect for someone who has been sitting there for 5 days waiting for him to spawn.  If they dont thats terrible and lots of pple will look down upon you.  Anyone who thinks it fair to just walk up and take RF from someone who has been waiting a week for him to spawn should rethink what they are saying.  what you are saying if you think that is just because say cutting in a line someone isnt illegal you can do it?  no, its just a civilized thing to do it wait your turn not just strong arm someone out of something.  Just because your a bigger guild doesnt mean you have the right to come 1 day b4 RF spawns and claim that he is yours when someone else is already there.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Im not arguing the fact that you had a capable force there first. Truth is I dont know. Did AD? Did PC? Did Greylords? I do know that whomever actually did have a capable force there first to kill him would be due the spawn. What im arguing is this retarded mentality that because you parked cleric and a few other morons there for who the hell cares how long that you somehow deserve that epic more than anyone on the server. Ive played eq with clerics that put in 6- 8 hours a night, who are selfless beyond belief, who played within months of the server opening but do to the nature of their lives could not spend continguous days online. What youre telling me is because you have the time to sit in one spot literally doing nothing but holding the ground down that you somehow deserve the epic more than these people that I know. That is just plain sh1t. You arent owed anything for that stint. Im not downplaying the attitude or the character of any of your friends cause frankly I dont know any of you. They may be the best people and clerics on emarr. But sitting on your ass in skyfire doing nothing doesnt make you more deserving. <br>

At least the SolB camp had more validity to it because some effort was needed to hold the camp and therefore in my eyes should be respected by normal camp rules <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Yes by them sitting there longer they do deserve RF more this time then those other pple.  You dont get everything you want when you want it.  Alot of things in life you have to wait for you cant just strong arm pple to get it and if you can its still not right.  Like anything you have to wait in line its common courtesy to wait and not try to strong arm your way to the front.  So these pple who think because they are a bigger guild then another that they deserve to be able to just go up and get any item anytime they want even if someoen is there need to learn some respect.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/udalamarndarkgem.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dalamarn Darkgem</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 488<br> <font color=#E9D756>(7/26/02 4:15:29 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3495.topic&index=110>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Other guild response</span><hr size=1> I'm going to stop posting on this here until we hear from the leadership of the mentioned guilds.

Im really sorry all this had to happen but in this case it doesnt seem like finger pointing and name calling is gonna solve anything, some stuff was handled wrong by all of you, your all at fault PC, AD, and GL. Id like to think were all adults and capable of comming to reasonable decisions together. However i do understand in EQ that very rarely ever happens, however from what i can tell all 3 guilds lost there cool and acted like children. You ALL owe each other an apology and you ALL owe each other the respect to talk things out and get over it like civilized people.  Gnome Out O_o<br>

My cleric has no intentions of going thru all this for click stick. <br>
<br>
What I did want to address is the issue of the value of time spent camping an epic MOB. I thought that VI had addressed the issue of the value of time long ago and I dont know if they have applied it this way or not but I do remember seeing posts on the subject from VI. They have often described time as one of the currencies of advancement in the game. If this is true in terms of advancing levels, I would personally like to see them use it as a currency in terms of gaining an epic item. An epic is second only to level in terms of status. Even players with items better than the epic (LOTS of warriors) make sure they have their epic. I would hate to see a clerics epic devalued by shortening the length of the spawn time (and thus increasing the number of epics in game) but it really is a must in raid situations. The very fact that this server couldnt conduct this kill in an orderly list fashion, means that a FFA will never happen in a civilized fashion. If it could, then a list would have worked. Maybe the answer is for the top guilds to hire themselves out as mercenaries to the lower guilds as aid in the RF camp.  :P<br>
<br>
I hate posting on probs when I cant suggest a solution but I dont see one here that is satisfactory. <p>I think, therefore I am . . .

I got there in the evening (7 PM CDT) so not going to comment on events beforehand for which I don't have first hand knowledge, though I do find it assuming that others choose to do so (see: Freeze below).<br>
<br>
Ragefire:  Mob which has the last item needed to complete the cleric epic and the most covented epic item for a guild to complete for their cleric(s), because of the raid/mob saving nature of the ability of the watersprinkler.<br>
<br>
I remember when RF was first moved to SF and an e-marr town hall meeting was set up to make a decision with respect to the process (i.e. 'RF camp').  As I recall, it was decided to make the first spawn of the week FFA, and subsequently each cleric who was at the RF point (and could prove it) was given a 'lottery number' for which a moderator would roll to determine the lucky winner(s) for a given time frame.<br>
<br>
Basically because these rules were not followed, the whole situation/issue took place, which is unfortunate.  My opinion is that this community tries to resolve the RF to avoid a repeat of what happened last night.  <br>
<br>
I play the game because I enjoy it and last night was actually fun for me despite the ongoing dispute in /ooc.  I saw people in other guilds I don't talk trash to or hang with as much as I used to (including Lannados, Uzzy, and others).  In addition I was talking with others in both PC/RE/Affliction (and not about the who mess going on at the time).  Though I know only one person from an in-game encounter with an epic mob I'm sure I've grouped w/ several AD members in OS.  This game in my eyes is about two things 1) The people you interact with to make the game fun for all concerned and 2) levels (allowing the group/raid/guild your with to accomplish more with fewer people).<br>
<br>
Freeze:  You were not there at all and don't have any business making comments about guild reputation when you can't even follow through with your word to 'delete your character if you didn't get back into Greylords' as a quote you made to me 5 months ago while 'apologizing' to others.  Remember also trying to bad mouth guilds is bad for business not that you'll ever see any from me.  <br>

<br>
I dunno how to spell Samien's name, but the other cleric who came and sat down right in the middle of us so they would have a chance of gaining aggro was named Raijin or Raijiin, something like that.<br>
<br>
Like I mentioned before, they came, they sat, I asked him if he and the rogue were planning to take him themselves, and he said he had 6 manaburn wizzies ready and waiting. He also went LD or camped about 3 or 4 times while he sat there, they both did actually (2 computers? hmm)<br>
<br>
They were why a GM was called upon in the first place, and the ruling after that was what caused PC to pull more people in and GreyLords to come along. When the GM shouted to all the zone that whoever had the force capable of taking it got it, they moved in.<br>
<br>
When she said this, he shouted that he needed a TL out, and we thought it was done with, and we TL'd him to GD, but he came back about 15 minutes later and sat down again <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>If I was an Everquest character, I'd be:<br>

Thanks PC and GL</span><hr size=1> hello everyone,<br>
<br>
This isn't a flame its two questions I&quot;m really curious about.  <br>
<br>
1. Why would you camp something for 82 hours (an this time frame I'm still confused on.) when you knew a server patch was due to come on Tuesday night?<br>
<br>
2. Why did you camp this if you knew Ragefires spawn time reset at server reset?<br>
<br>
I simply don't understand why? If you had looked at his spawn time an at the server reset times you could easily see the spawn times pattern. However if you didn't do this then you would not of known.<br>
<br>
Thank you for your time,<br>

Thanks PC and GL</span><hr size=1> i'll answer. Ragefire had a chance to spawn in the days before the patch. albiet his past history shows he rarely does pop inside of the first few days of his cycle, we figured it was worth the small chance. as the cycle progressed, we built up a progressivly larger number of ready people in the zone. i'm not sure where the 82 hours comes from, but i know we had coverage for the solid 40 before the patch, simply becuase i was there for alot of it.<br>
<br>
After a patch ragefire also has a chance to spawn, it was this post patch (within 72 hours of patch) cycle that generated all the problems.<br>
<br>
for the most part i see this entire matter as closed. Yes, alot of people got angry and made comments that they may now regret, well, it's over and done. factions have been changed all over the board. It is my hope that everyone came away from this nasty experience learning something. <br>
<br>
Ragefire is still one of those spawns people will argue over, some guilds will get along and help each other, others will tear out each others throats in order to get it. It is my hope that eventually someone will find a solid middle ground that everyone can agree on so that we prevent this kind of action from happening again. Remember, it's not what you have that people admire, it's how you got it. <p>Atroxis Crotalus <br>
