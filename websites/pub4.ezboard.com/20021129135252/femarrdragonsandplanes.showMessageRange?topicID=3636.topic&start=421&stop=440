Actually, I think you just get off on causing all kinds of @#%$, tho it can be amusing for a bit it gets old.<br>
<br>
If you are actively on EMarr you hide who you are very well, but your lack of common knowledge of newer changes in items and zones leads me to believe that you are not active on any server in EQ.<br>
I would be surprised if you had a character over 45 but that is easily verifiable by anyone who had raided with you in the past.<br>
<br>
BTW: you never spoke to it, but that SS did not come from the new UI. You did state it was the new UI, which it was not, so I question whether you've actually used the new UI at all.  <p>Langree<BR>

<br>
<br>
I expected as much though since there is nothing you can say to them without burying yourself even more.<br>
<br>
<br>
However to summarize.   It was said that a player who was retiring gave his account to the guildmaster who then gave it to Atom.   Number 4 of the EULA says you cannot give your password to anyone.   That had to be done in order to give the account to anyone. Therefore that rule was broken.<br>
<br>
<br>
Also, noone ever refuted what Zel said (not that I saw at least) what folks were challenging was the integrity of the screen shot and the validity of what it showed versus what you were trying to make us THINK it showed. As usual you pick your own versions of what the problem is choosig whichever best suits your angle at that time.<br>
<br>
However,  you gave up using the screen shot as proof once someone spoke up on your behalf, suddenly the point of the screen shot changed.<br>

Information, or statements that dont come from me, I wont vouch for unless<br>
it serves my purpose. Any conclusions you make, from statements other than mine,<br>
are in no way, my responsibility. Therefore I dont feel the need to comment<br>
on what Atom has to say. I neither deny nor affirm it now.<br>
<br>
I will state, clearly and succintly, that I do not feel I am in violation of the EULA.<br>
Of course I do have the small advantage of having actually read it. That implies<br>
that I know what a violation of it is. It is exactly upon this point that your argument becomes invalid. That is all I am willing to say.(about that)<br>

<br>
Chiteng is either incredibly stupid or incredibly deceptive.<br>
&quot;I never said I had played in ToV, but my character has.&quot; despite posting a screen shot in response to being accused of not playing the high end game. But he says the screenshot was not meant to imply anything more than that he had been in the zone.<br>
<br>
Of course he is witless to believe that this didn't lower our impression of him. I used to honestly believe Chiteng was persecuted, but now I see the truth. He is an imbecile. He is psychotic, totally unaware of his own hipocrisy. <br>
<br>
He is either deceptive and dishonest in everything he does, or he is an idiot savant somehow gifted with the ability to form sentances without any measurable intellect. Manipulating truths to present a false impression is still deception and is still lying.<br>
<br>
Chiteng is selective in which rules apply to him. The morals of honesty don't apply, his lies are never worded to be direct lies, or if they were, he was misunderstood. The EULA does not apply to him despite directly forbidding more than one person to ever access the same account. Yet he claims not to violate that. When presented with facts he glazes past them if he cannot defend against them. He selectivly chooses which posts to respond to with empty flames. These posts are usually empty flames in themselves. Ask him a question with substance and he will not answer or if he does he will be dodgy and present evidence which is meant to be miscontrued.<br>
<br>
Furthermore he is in violation of the board rules since he is now posting anonymous. He claims to be a current EQ player but admits that Chiteng is not his current character.<br>

The EULA oddly enough says a bit more than that. In fact it says ALOT more than that. You really should read it.<br>
<br>
For me to actually believe that 'selectively replying' is a concern to you,<br>
you would have to flame each poster on this board who does it. You would indeed be a very busy man. Next time just say 'is evasive' its more consise and accurate.<br>
But again, if it actually annoys you, and you expect to have that impact, you must<br>
say it of all people who do it, not just me. Otherwise your reveal yourself as simply partisan.<br>

You actually sort of answer my first question there, you haven't run the exe since you did /newui, the new ui was introduced quite awhile back. <p>Langree<BR>

That is amazing really. I had no idea.<br>
I wonder then what I have been doing if the word 'played' doenst apply<br>
because of the old-ui.<br>
<br>
It is exactly for reasons like these, that people misunderstand other people.<br>
<br>
You assume lack of knowledge means == hasnt played.(whatever that means to you)<br>
<br>
That isnt at all what it actually means. It only means == lack of knowledge.<br>

'YOU' feel all that means. By doing that, you presume to define<br>
EVERYTHING else according to your standards. I think you will find that this<br>
board is a bit resistant to people who do that. Believe me, I know.<br>

<br>
Just to get things back on track, Chiteng, you have repeatedly stated that Hoppkins harrassed you on a raid.  You used that fact to justify the usual self delusional rant that started this post.  And yet, despite being asked, repeatedly, to tell us 'What raid?', 'When it was?', and exactly how you were harrassed, you have sidestepped or failed to reply every single time.<br>
<br>
So I ask one more time.<br>
What raid?<br>
When was it?<br>
How were you harrassed?<br>

<br>
 I can pretty safely say that when you got on the other night to get that SS you may have very well activated the new UI and have not been on since. You claimed the SS was the new UI, so you lacked the understanding at that time to know you had to activate it and restart EQ to actually see it.<br>
<br>
Why activate the new UI now? Simple, You haven't been on for months since before they put the UI live.<br>
<br>
As for played.. you're playing word games I asked you not to play. You know what played means. I think a lot of things of you, stupid isn't one. <p>Langree<BR>

Second, did Atom lie or not?  Saying you wont deny or confirm it and can't be held to someone elses words is blatant sidestepping.   You won't answer because again any answer you give will paint you into a corner as either a) Lying and breaking rule number 4 of the EULA and yes I read it,  or b) accusing Atom of lying.   Since you WONT answer I and many others here are being forced to believe that Atom was indeed stating fact and thus making you a violater.  <br>
<br>
As for not believing that giving your account information to someone else is not in violation,  you really are a dumb @#%$ if you believe that and even DUMBER if you think that you can somehow force the rest of us to believe that.<br>

Actually no Ysall the harassment issue<br>
was an example of the guild leadership inaction. The actual complaint was<br>
made quite a while ago.<br>
<br>
The raid was supposed to be in DN but in reality we got displaced by some other guild that the raid leader didnt wish to cross. The date I am sorry, I dont recall<br>
you could of course ask Ninya. The eventual target was Klandicar(sp?)<br>
stupid blue dragon in the ice valley. We got our asses kicked wasted about 4 hours and quit. I had signed up, to go to DN. But like a good little guildmate, I did<br>
what everyone else did.<br>
<br>
If you have an actual interest in the actual complaint,<br>
mail me at chiteng7@yahoo.com<br>
I will not only send you a full and complete explanation but indeed I will send you a copy of the exact same original complaint that I mailed to Til.<br>
Just give me your e-mail.<br>
<br>
No I will not post it here. It is none of their business. Its a guild issue.<br>
