I started in August 1999 and here I am done in April of 2002, and things are collapsing on me, my life, the enjoyment of the game, my ability to choose right from wrong without having some force bump my reasoning thoughts out of line.  Chamcham was a mistake and Zelgadis was supposed to be a masterpiece, and I thank Radient Eclipse for providing me with the help that they could... if only we didn't have so many complications with which character they wanted and which I wanted...<br>
<br>
  Zelgadis (September 1999) and Chamcham (November 1999) became real pumped up since I helped form Radient Eclipse with Gorndax.  Never thought I'd raid ToV before, but we did.  I got Zelgadis 75% towards being perfect, I'd say.  Epics, Skyshrine BP and other pieces of armor.  The goal was to show everyone who joked about rangers so often and took to heart how they say they can't tank or anything in the high end game how they were wrong, and I just barely made it.  Thanks to those who had faith in me when I went up to tank high end monsters when we some times lacked warriors, paladins, and shadow knights.<br>
<br>
  If anyone knows Eblan, he's my RL brother, and Zraiz is a good RL friend of mine.  They'll both be taking over my account and characters.  But Eblan said I'd be able to come around and play the account if I ever felt like coming back.  Eblan seems to think that there is no Emarr without Chamcham and Zelgadis, or me if that's what they meant.  I wouldn't be going if I had the money to get a second account and pay for both of them and transfer Zelgadis or Chamcham to the other account and play them both at the same time.  That would have solved some problems.  But anyway, if you see my characters around they'll probably be Eblan or Zraiz messing with them.  I warned them that Chamcham's at the bare minimum of keeping level 60 again. Hopefully they'll keep that in mind. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :o --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/embarassed.gif ALT=":o"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
To those of you who knew me and appreciated me, I really liked running around helping you as well.  But in all truths I hated Chamcham to the utter pits of hell.  I made her to help rid a friend of mine of her stalkers, but don't get the wrong ideas there!!  I couldn't stop playing her, though, and kept going, but she became too well known and people were really starting to really depend on her enchanter abilities and I was unable to persue my rangerly dreams and the game just went down hill.  Thanks for sticking around, though, being around for an ear when I really had to rant and complain about my hellish life.  Not sure if you really cared.  I should have kept my mouth shut, though.<br>
<br>
Those of you who I seem to still remember from back when I hunted in North Ro - Sarkam, Inmountain, Lendari, Belzebu, Bradilar, Elnots, good to see you're still living it.<br>
<br>
To those of you who I used to be in Phoenix Crusaders with - Antilles, Kavis, Kelador, Blackmask, Zacarius, etc, things never seemed to be the same after I left to head back to Champions of Marr.<br>
<br>
To, uh, Champions of Marr - Keep pressing on, I know I was around since Esperanza took leadership and the guild just kept growing, it doesn't matter if you can or cannot do high end raids in the end, you just can't let pety restrictions keep you from having fun, and you gotta keep living.  Bye Hakko.<br>
<br>
Esperanza - it's good to know you aren't having your old problems anymore.  Now I need to read upon what remedy you took to fix up your life to fix up my own.  Time to get a job and move out of the family's house.  I'll pay you back some day, but thanks for paying for my account since my father cancelled his credit card paying for it before.<br>
<br>
Gorndax and Ironlute - Keep strong, both of you.  Ironlute, you've come a long ways, but you've also still got a long way to come.  Gorndax, keep that iron will of yours to the bitter cold end.  I don't know what you two will do when I'm gone, but I'll probably find out.<br>
<br>
Lendari - I'm sorry things had to come down to the way they are.  You're young and you have much to learn about truth, justice, and the right way to go about life, it seems.  But you were a sweet girl there for a while.<br>
<br>
To Iwka - Thanks for showing good spirit all the time, you were really the most bouncey person I had ever run into in all my days.  Sorry you'll miss me so much.  I'll try to have my friends leave the Ring of the Ancients you let me loot until we've found a better reasonable use for it.<br>
<br>
To Blessing - Thanks for trying to help me with Zelgadis so much, it was really appreciated.<br>
<br>
To Affliction - You guys were awesome, thanks for helping my guild get introduced to ToV HoT, and all the other things you've helped out with for everyone else in the game.<br>
<br>
To Radiant Eclipse - Time for you all to go raiding without my clarity or my haste, but I'm sure you can do just the same.  Sorry I had to yell at all you melee for not assisting correctly at times, and the pet users to destroy your pets when I saw some out of line when things got too far and painful.  That's just the way I raided, though.  Oh yeah, be sure to get lots of resist gear and levels, I'll be giving back all the guild's jewelry gem donations soon enough!!<br>
<br>
To a large rat - splat!<br>
<br>
To a crypt mummy - crunch!<br>
<br>
To a desert scarab - pop!<br>
<br>
To everyone else - I'm sorry I had to play EQ around you under such a false identity such as Chamcham, and I'm sorry if anyone got the wrong impression.  It's one less guy playing a girl character for you to worry about.  I tried my best to serve everyone, though.  You guys won't have to hear my anti-crack rants anymore either, and I'm sure Eblan and Zraiz are less resistant to that if you see Chamcham around later. *sigh*<br>
<br>
Well, I'm going to be out looking for a life now, and by the time I hit the Post button I will have gotten rid of every person who said they'd never talk to me again and hate me forever if I *gasp* left EQ for a little bit to hang around RL friends or, heaven forbid, to get a job and have a good time!  I'm also going to be trying to design a game based on my story called Neon Project Earth using the program Multimedia Fusion (If anyone out there has used any of the Klick programs by Clickteam before?  I've always wondered)... all by myself...  But anyway, I'll be seeing you all around in some other form some day.  Sorry if this post is too long.<br>

He's right.  I've thought about coming back to EQ a couple times, but besides my issues with the game I just don't think it'd be fun without all the people I used to know.  Not that we were close buds or anything, but you were one of those people that I figured I could count on to do a great job, be honest, and be fun.  There's just no way EQ could be like it used to be for me without people like that.  Anyway, I'm buzzed and rambling... have fun, I hope you get your life going the way you want it to soon.

Take care Cham, the enchy life definitely isn't for everyone, no blame to lay at your feet for that one!<br>
Hope you find much joy in the beauty of Spring, if there's ever a season to say goodbye to the indoors, this is it.<br>

There is a theory which states that if ever anyone discovers exactly what the universe is for and why it is here, it will instantly disappear and be replaced by something even more bizarre and inexplicable. 
There is another which states that this has already happened.<BR>
