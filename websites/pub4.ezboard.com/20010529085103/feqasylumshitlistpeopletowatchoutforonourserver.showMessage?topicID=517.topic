They invited me to join them. They are 10 or so levels above me, so they did not get much exp for kills there, but they stuck around and helped me to try and get FBSS even after they both got one, for 4 hours. They finally had to leave, so they helped me get another group together. <br>
<br>
I was leader of new full group. The loot rules were I get first FBSS that drops, then tanks start rolling, then casters (was need before greed). all other items and dropped stuff was FFA  roll on any other good items myself excluded. It was agreed by group except 2 so they left. So that meant Ranger was next to recieve FBSS. The party agreed to this. Party consisted of myself (Faelorn, Monk), Sandies(Shaman), Hajime(Ranger), and Chrisimatic(Necro). Things went very well, Sandies and myself were getting great exp the other two would get the old green and not to much exp. I had to log to fix a bug and Hajime became leader. Then first FBSS droped after 3 hours with new group .We were all killed but Sandies looted FBSS before she died. Great thing she had the chance. After getting back and getting rez's she gave me the FBSS. Then the fighting started. Hajime and Sandies congratulated me and Chrisimatic started saying he wanted to roll, that he never agreed to these loot rules or he would not have stayed, that he lost more exp in that death then he gained in two weeks and that he only had 8000pp to his name. Hajime said that he only had 100pp in bank and I said that i only had 600pp (after checking have 750pp). The others and myself kept insisting that this is the way it was as far as looting goes. Chrisimatic just wanted to sell FBSS but need before greed was stated.It was agreed apon in the beginning. so finally Hajime said the next one that drops we will roll on. By this time another Frenzy spawned who also had FBSS. Chrisimatic pulled it to us without casting his pet. Then proceded to watch us die with himself include, I escaped death when FD finally worked. So I waited for others and Chrisimatic said he had rez's coming. Chrisimatic disbanded. When Chrisimatic gets back to frenzy spawn tells me rez's is coming. so we wait a bit. Then I deciede to check for other Clerics. Only Cleric in zone is at king spawn in group and can not leave. While waiting Chrisimatic started killing Ghouls in hall. I was no longer leader so could not reinvte him and Hajime was bound in Thurgen. Chrisimatic told me that the Cleric in the zone was on his way and would be a bit. I gave Cleric a tell And he said he could not help us, sorry. Then Chrisimatic pulled the Frenzy. there was nothing I could do cause I am to low a lvl and cant solo frenzy. Then Chrisimatic looted the FBSS then logged. He did not even get us rez's like he said he was. I had camped the spot for a total of 10 hours and seen 4 FBSS drop got one but that was for Hajime or at least to be rolled one. we petitioned GM, Talked with an officer of Chrisimatic's guild. Everyone was very upset with this. I thought this kind of stuff only happened to newbies. Buy this time we had to still get rez's and ITU to get out. No one was capable of doing this in our party or zone. Was talking with Chrisimatics's guild officer who was nice enough to send someone to help us. Which I thought was really nice. <br>
<br>
I really think that CHRISIMATIC is not a very nice person for doing this. Guys like this make the game not much fun. Brings the whole mood of the party down.<br>

Sounds like Chrisimatic was trying to aquire the spawn with killing them off. Being a 52 necro same as Chrisimatic its not easy to break the spawn always but easy to maintain it. I don't see how a 52 necro can let an entire group die from 1 or 2 mobs unless purposely or was completey oom.

<br>
Just wanted to give my feedback.  I am an officer in UPON and found out about this the other night.  After talking with four people about this, and comparing the information on what happened, I discussed this with the leadership of UPON.<br>
<br>
We've decided to remove Chrisimatic from our guild, I apologize to Faelron and the others who were hurt by this.  I wish I could reverse what happened, but I can't.<br>
<br>
Faelron and anyone else who wants some help with the Frenzy please send me a tell and I'll come help you camp it to get the FBSS.<br>
<br>
My personal opinion is to stay away from Chrisimatic, he's not worth the hassle.</font><P><img src="http://www.gusekweb.net/images/newsig.jpg"><P><i></i></TD></TR><TR BGCOLOR=#D5D4D5><TD NOWRAP width=20% valign=top align=left><B><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2><A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ueuripedmoped.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Euriped Moped</A></FONT></B><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>w4nn4b3!</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>(</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#000033>5/13/01</FONT> <FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#000033>9:57:30 pm</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>)<BR></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT><B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">Re: A great night in lower guk ends badly at FRENZY</font></B><HR><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">I have my own story about Christimatic.<br>
<br>
I was level 34, I had just gotten my new spells (I am a Magician) and I was camping the Rangers in ECommons. <br>
<br>
We were doing just fine, the spawn is easy to hold with two level 29-38 (1 solo 39-42) and we were having a good time, getting good exp, and good money.<br>
<br>
Christimatic comes along, out of nowhere, and tells me &quot;I am going to take the next one&quot;  I promptly returned with the usual &quot;why&quot; and he said &quot;for exp&quot;.  I said no.  This was a camp that me and my necro friend had been at for a few hours now, we had it under control, and the exp would be worthless and slow if he were to start taking every other ranger from us. <br>
<br>
Now, I didn't want to be a hog, but here he was, level 41, trying to take the spawn from two people who had been there.  That wouldn't have been a REALLY bad thing, but that the OTHER SPAWN WAS NOT TAKEN.  I told him to go to ECommons, but he refused.  I checked with a friend who was hunting Dervs in the EC (his twink bard) and he confirmed the other spawn was not taken.  Christimatic refused to leave, and began KSing every Ranger.  <br>
<br>
I just decided to leave, because it isn't fun to sit there with nerves on end just for a stupid camp.  My necro friend stayed, Chrisimatic left a long, LONG time after, and she found another partner and hunted more.<br>
<br>
I knew the MOMENT that I heard all the names listed who was being shitlisted, and I totally agree and confirm that this isn't a one time thing. Chrisimatic is a pretty arrogant ass, and we should all avoid him.<br>
<br>
Oh, I also want to say good job Sandies.  Totally like her to be fair, even if she is a big ugly buttscratcher:P<br>

<br>
I too was at the Frenzied spawn, and this Chrismatic guy showed up, and joined our group. I was playing my alt necro at the time, and he decided to change the rules to:  Chrismatic before need, before greed. We sat at waited for one other member to show up, so Chris started to pull. He came back without his pet, and sat in the group. All of a sudden, two ghouls (That must have just eaten his pet) swooped in and ate him. <br>
<br>
Since our new member was waiting at the zone, and chrismatic had to wander back in, we hoped he would pick up this new member. Instead, he decided to ignore the group, and show up alone. He looted, and prepared for the frenzied fight. We had a rare opportunity of 2 frenzied ghoul pops at one time. This is when, he claimed he needed becuase he needed the money. Then, he told us to shut up about the new member, and we will get him later. So, we began to fight, and one of the members died, because we didn't have enough people. Chris looted as fast as he could, took the ring, and left the group. He then went over, and took the camp from the group.<br>
<br>
This is where I left the group, and came down as myself, and gave the other party member who died a res with my epic. Not Chrismatic.<br>
<br>
Chrismatic, if you ever read this, you can forget about help from me in any form. You are a worthless person, and a waste of everyones time. <br>

I was doing the Savant level with my group on the LT in L Guk for about an hour when he and a partner took the lower area.  Ever time someone called camp check we called Savant for over an hour.  Well the Savant pops and is casting so I go to pull him and lo and behold he is gone when I arrive.  Uh oh.  I look and can't find it.  Ok someone accidentily agro'd him.  I /ooc'd to see and no one replied so I think hmmmmmmm.  Next time it pops I am just outside room.  I run in to see Chrisimatic running down the stairs with the Savant in tow.  I sent him a tell asking what the deal was and he said.  Oh oops it agrod me and now my pet has killed it.  Sorry.  I said well hey we were calling the Savant area for the last hour what in the world are you even doing up here?  He responds that basically we can't have the Savant because he and his partner have the Lower Tower.  I argued with him until he agreed that we had been up there longer than he and that he'd camp the lower area only.  So we start pulling again and next time it spawns Lo and Behold who comes running up and tries to KS it AGAIN?  You guessed it Chrisimatic.  Fortunately I was hasted and knocked it's teeth into the back of it's head so it was more mad at me than him and we got the kill.  I asked Chris what he was doing and next thing I know there is a nice train of froggies coming up the stairs at me.  I FD'd and waited it out.  The Ass/sup camp came open at this time and it was suggested we move camps instead of getting trained and KS'd by this jerk.  We moved up the there and I was trained from below one more time and had to /q out before I died.  At this point I contacted a member of his previous guild to get some assistance.  They were quite nice and got both sides of the story.  This guy is just plain bad news and he is a jerk besides.</font><P>Laguer Bloodreaper  <BR>

We're sitting by the ramp where you zone in from skyshrine killing wyverns. Chrisimatic comes up and send me a tell asking &quot;you guys need a 51 necro?&quot; I ask the group, and they all agree that we're ok for now. So I send him a tell saying that we're fine for now, but if we needed him I would send a tell.<br>
<br>
Well about 5 minutes later, I see him run up the cliff from where the bulthar are, run by us...and a couple seconds later my group is hit by 3 bulthar. The druid in our group was killed due to one of the bulthar being the heardleader and her getting summoned as she tried to run away. I can tell you without a doubt, it was Chrisimatic that trained us.<br>
<br>
For a while I thought, hey...he didn't do it on purpose, was an accident. But now that I see this, I'm pretty sure he did it out of spite for not being allowed to join the group. Sad to see someone stoop as low as this to get their way. This sorry PoS deserves to be beat with a 40 pound noodle.<br>

<br>
Or better yet; this would be nice. Every guy that has EARNED his spot on the list (Binidin, Byars, this Guy, Golgothian, Stoowie); the SL ppl who are like these guys should be forcefully made pvp. The only catch is; that they are FREE GAME for EVERYONE on the server; but they can ONLY attack other pvp's. Yea, I'd LOVE to see how quickly they're running back here to appologize.<br>
<br>
The only difference would be that we can't take their items unless they are TOO twinked. In that case; reg pvp rules apply. </font><P><P><i></i></TD></TR><TR BGCOLOR=#D5D4D5><TD NOWRAP width=20% valign=top align=left><B><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2><A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uleolanhazzan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Leolan Hazzan</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_bluespot.gif BORDER=0></FONT></B><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1><FONT COLOR=AA0000><B>Lanys.com Moderator</B></FONT></FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>(</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#000033>5/16/01</FONT> <FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#000033>6:05:45 pm</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>)<BR></FONT><BR><img src=http://www.acinternet.com/leolan/leopic.asp WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT><B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">Re: A great night in lower guk ends badly at FRENZY</font></B><HR><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">Please edit post title to conform to the rules.</font><P>&nbsp;- Leo<P><i></i></TD></TR><TR BGCOLOR=#E5E5E6><TD NOWRAP width=20% valign=top align=left><B><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2><A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ufaelorn2.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Faelorn2</A></FONT></B><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>n00b!</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>(</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#000033>5/17/01</FONT> <FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#000033>7:38:00 pm</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>)<BR></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT><B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">Re: A great night in lower guk ends badly at FRENZY</font></B><HR><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">Well I talked to GM and he said that since we could not hold spawn with out him , we were camping a spawn to high for our level so there is nothing he could do. I thought that sucked. So if your cleric in your group decides not to heal you and you die then he steals loot, I guess this is ok, cause you could not hold spawn alone. That Just Sucks, when you are in a group, you try to relie on them to do there part, cause if they don't you probly will die. <br>
    When loot rules are set up, you follow them. If you dont like them you need to speak up and not wait till last minuteto try and change them. All I can say now is &quot;bad form Peter&quot;.<br>
