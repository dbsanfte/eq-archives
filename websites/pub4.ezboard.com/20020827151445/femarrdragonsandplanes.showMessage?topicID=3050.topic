<br>
A few weeks ago, I posted about my traumatic breakup.  Many of you said that even after a break up, its still possible to be friends.  My question now is, HOW?<br>
<br>
We went out for Valentine's Day last night.  Went out to dinner, then watched a movie.  It was really great...until he decided that he wanted to go out for drinks.  Since we did everything I wanted to do, I said 'ok'.  Everything was fine until the last hour.  <br>
<br>
I noticed this girl getting closer and closer to him all night, and I knew she was plotting something.  I even stood right in front of her blocking her access to him at one point, but she didn't get the point.  So then she asks if we are together, and he says NO!  Which, since we went out as friends, is true, but still!  Then they start talking and she had to go drive her friends home.  It was almost closing.  So while we are walking home, she appears out of nowhere!  <br>
<br>
&quot;oh I was just seeing if the bar was still open...&quot; (Yeah right) and then asked him out right in front of me!  He said he was busy but maybe he'd see her around.  Then he asked if she goes online (yeah kinda lame I know) but she said she doesn't have a computer.  And that was pretty much it.<br>
<br>
I was agast in horror!  That definitely ruined my night.  I was home by 2:30 and didn't fall asleep intil almost 8 am because I kept thinking about him and that girl.  So I emailed him this LONG LONG LONG email explaining that I was trying, but that I still had feelings for him and its hard for me still, especially when we go into places where singles are likely to try to pick him up.  <br>
<br>
I don't know what to do...making this transition to &quot;friends&quot; is SOO hard.  Please help if you can!  SO many of you managed to do it, I hope I can too!  I don't want to lose him entirely...<br>

<br>
You need to be at the point that you don't care if another girl is interested in him, or if he's dating someone else.  If you still care, you're not ready to be just friends yet.<br>
<br>
My ex boyfriend, the one I'm still friends with? If he were single, I could sit at a bar with him and point out cute girls for him to look at and tease him and offer to introduce him to other women.  He's just a friend.  Since he's engaged to be married and I'm friends with his fiance, I have spent several conversations talking about their cake and her dress and where they are having the reception without one twinge of jealousy, he's just a friend.<br>

Unfortunately, he doesn't appear to have had the same expectations.  I know where you're at right now, and it sucks, but the best thing you can do for yourself is to just stay away from him for a while.

Like others have said...perhaps let him be for a while and hang with other people until those old feelings for your ex fade away a fair bit. <p><center><img src="http://users.bigpond.com/raymies/flickglowing.gif">

If he hadn't hooked up with that other girl, he probably would've made a sexual play for you, and all it would've been about for him was the sex, not a relationship (which you very well may have misinterpreted).  Since that's clearly not what you want, despite the pain that may have been caused by his ditching you, it was a whole lot less pain than just using you for sex.  I've been used in this way, and it's no fun.<br>
<br>
And others are right.  You can remain friends, but only after time.  After you've moved on and found someone else you care about, then you might be able to be &quot;friends.&quot;  Assuming of course, that you really want to be friends.  If your motivation is to hope to win him back, and his motivation is merely to have a back-up sex partner, you both are destined for failure. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=96910">My Equipment</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uanalornesongheart.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Analorne Songheart</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_lightning.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 236<br> <font color=#E9D756>(2/16/02 9:36:45 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3050.topic&index=10>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Needed:  Advice (related to an old post)</span><hr size=1> I have exes that I'm friends with, but it was not an immediate thing.

<br>
You can be friends if and when you both decide that you want that person in your life, but you want nothing else from them.  When you can be genuinely happy about them having a date with someone nice, etc.  <br>
<br>
It takes a lot of time and it doesn't always happen.  <br>
<br>
Don't force it and don't do anything you aren't ready for.  If you can't stand to see him with another girl, you aren't ready for friendship with him yet.  It doesn't mean you don't care, it's just that the wound is still too fresh.<br>
<br>
Take some time.  Maybe go out on a date of your own.  Let your ex know that you need some time before you can be &quot;just a good friend&quot; without feeling uncomfortable with it.  Maybe he feels the same way?<br>

But I'm telling you we're &quot;friends&quot;. Thats what we decided when we broke up and thats how it's going to be.<br>
<br>
Once you've been intimate with someone it's very difficult to see them in any other light. Truth be told it may have been about the sex for him but if we're being honest how much of the intimacy were you hoping to re-kindle.<br>
<br>
Often it's easier to walk away then it is to call a friendship a friendship, when all you want to do is be more then friends.<br>

If you tell him you just want to be friends, mean it.  Don't say it because you want to stay close to him and you hope that deep down, you'll get back together.  It never happens that way.  You need to get over him first, THEN be friends.  And, I hate to tell you, but if a girl flirting with him and him not even accepting her offer to go out was enough to ruin your night, you're not over him.  Trust me on this one; there's no hope of a friendship between you two if you're still secretly hoping to get back with him.  And if you look really deep, I think you'll see that that might be what you really want.  <br>

So my advice would be to back up for a bit, go out with some girlfriends, have fun, and get used to being without him and having a life separate from him.  Then, when you know you can really look at him as a friend and not want anything more, start hanging out with him again.  <br>

You didn't become an item overnight, you're not going to become friends overnight, either.<br>
<br>
If my husband divorced me, I would be devastated for a time being, I'd allow myself to grieve the end of a relationship I had been a part of, then I'd kick his ass, then I'd get over it, then I'd go date some hot guys, then I'd get laid, then the world would make perfect sense again.<br>
<br>
As awesome as I am, I couldn't be able to do that all in a short period of time.<br>
<br>
Take it slow.  Just because he wants to be friends but you're having a hard time taking the transition doesn't mean there's anything wrong with you.  Just because other people are friends with their exes and you're having a hard time making that happen doesn't mean there's anything wrong with you.  You just have to find your niche.  One thing you do have to do, though, is not cling to something that's gone.  That's where the pain is, from the attachment of something you can't have.<br>
<br>
That being said, can we get back to flaming, raving, ranting, and bitching?  Is group therapy session over yet? <p>- Aishen L`Fey -<br>

I may just be bitter, but when I break up with someone, that's it, I don't talk to them or anything, it's just alot of skeletons in the closet I don't want to remember.<br>
<br>
There's a reason I broke up with them, and it's not because I thought being &quot;friends&quot; would be better. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uarikel.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Arikel</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 2351<br> <font color=#E9D756>(2/17/02 1:56:52 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3050.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Hmm..</span><hr size=1> Analorne and Aishen pretty much summed up my take on the subject.

My RL ex-wife (Frostwolf, in-game) and I are best friends after 13 years of a relationship, including six years of marriage.  She's an amazing woman (to put up with me for that long?  Hell yeah.) and there's no way in hell that I'd lose that friendship merely because we were no longer married.  <br>
<br>
The first 6 months after we decided to divorce, however,  were very, very harsh.  There was a lot of really bad shit brought out on both sides, but we got past that in time.  It was cathartic, in a way, and it needed to be done.  Now she still has the key to my apartment, we borrow stuff from each other constantly, and she and I both know that we can rely on the other in every way. <br>
<br>
What is different in our situation, however, is that we both know that there could never be a reconciliation.  If we had gone out for Valentine's Day and some guy tried to pick her up, I would have cheered her on, winked as she left the table and whispered to the guy &quot;Hope ya get some.&quot;  And I would have left, grinning my ass off, because I know she would have told the guy that I'm her ex. *evil grin*<br>
<br>
Good luck to you, Kham.  It won't be easy, and it will hurt like hell, but if you really want a friend and not a return to what used to be, hang in there.  <br>
