Please flame me do whatever.  I just want someone to please tell me if you have ever heard of this guy.I have reposted under a differn't string so that I can Edit to a new Subject.<br>
<br>
Since no one has tryed to protect this guy I would like to have everyone know what this guy did to me.<br>
<br>
I was auctioning a iksar regen BP in east commons tunneland he was bothering me trying to do some very under-valued trades. I kept telling Gedien that I was not intrested and unless he had a better item I need at least 7kpp. <br>
<br>
About an hour later he auctioned Cloak of Shadows for a iksar regen BP, feeling that this guy finally got his head on straight, I told him that he had a deal. He came over and put the CoS in the trade window and I put mine up not realizing that I need this item on my main.<br>
<br>
(This is the point where my good trusting nature; where I should have learned by being scammed in the past was taken advantage of)<br>
<br>
I asked Gedien if he would take the CoS back and take a Hooded Black Cloak to my main. I really was not thinking at the time since I was late meeting a friend in RL.<br>
<br>
I logged back on with my main and Gedien put the items in my trade window and went LD. I was shocked that it had happened so I waited around for another 20 mins for him to come back, he never did. At this point I'm real late meeting my friend, so I call him and explain that I could not make it.<br>
<br>
I proceeded to /petition and a GM came back and told me that unless i have a screen shot that said that he would give right back to a certian player he would not even pursue any action. I knew that would be his answer so I started doing some stuff on my own. I gave a /shout to east commons letting everyone know what had happened. (got a lot of tells everyone giving me sympathy, but no resolution). Started telling all of my friends what had happened and they put Gedien on their friends list to see if they can locate him. This whole proccess took about 2 hours and still no Gedien. <br>
<br>
The next day, and about to quit EQ for lack of faith in all people, I logged back on. Saw Gedien immediatly and asked him what had happened he put the items in the trade window again without giving an excuse, saying he was sorry basicaly just here's your stuff. The kicker was before he hit trade he went LD again. I was about to punch my monitor,delete my account and remove myself from the crack we know as EQ.<br>
<br>
I have been looking for Gedien for the past 6 days he has not been on. I wake up in the middle of the night and log on just to see if he has changed hours and we are not on at the same time. Last Sunday I would log on every hour on the hour for 25 hours just to hopefully catch him and get my stuff.<br>
<br>
Gedien has become an obsession. <br>
<br>
I call out to all of you for some help. Please help me find this scammer. Or better than that tell me he's not a scammer and you personally know Gedien or your Gedien and you had a complete computer breakdown and have not been able to get on.<br>
<br>
Gedien - I beg you please give my stuff back.<br>
<br>
Thanks for reading the whole post I hope that you can help me. And please don't flame me I just would like some help.<br>
<br>
Thanks<br>

People may have acknowledged it but felt no need to post to it. Not much we can do about your problem other than shun the person in question. and that doesnt require a response heh.<br>
