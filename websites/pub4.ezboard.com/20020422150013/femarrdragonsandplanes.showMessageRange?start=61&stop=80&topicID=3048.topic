If you read carefully, I never once asserted I'm the best ranger.  I never assert that in game.  I've never once even claimed to be the best ranger and I'm far from it.  Above average, perhaps, but not best.<br>
<br>
Go back and read what you're flaming me for (carefully!) again for what it really is.  My replies to Jabener were over an old vendetta, which if you read all the replies, two other people have had ill experiences with her.  You were not meant to understand my list because the list details things Jabener herself has done, not anybody else- not a list to be applied to any ranger in general.  Basically she's fucked some shit up and I happened to either raiding with her or had my best EQ friend there to suffer the headache.  I don't see how I could have claimed I'm the best ranger through my list, nor do I see how any of this was your business in the first place.  And, I still don't see how you came to the conclusion I believe I'm the best ranger.  <br>
<br>
My reply to the ranger joke is because I really am sick of them.  Paraphrasing: It's been nearly 2 years since Kunark came out and I had to laugh along with the first one.  Did I say I was sick of them because I'm an awesome ranger and it doesn't apply to me?  No.  It's because when every other no-name Jack tries to be funny to impress people, rangers get brought up.  It really is a sore subject with me because I really am, quite frankly, tired of it at the time being.  I don't see how in that reply I'm asserting I'm a godly ranger.<br>
<br>
If you're going to rag on me for having a greater-than-thou attitude concerning rangers, make sure it concerns rangers first.  Read carefully before you flame people and make sure what you're saying is even fuckin' applicable.<br>
<br>
I'm not the best ranger and nor would I want to be known as the best ranger.  That lacks personality and is quite frankly, boring.  What I am, though, (which is probably what aided you to the jumping of the conclusion you landed on prematurely) snappy, egotistical, and well armed with my rapier sharp wit.  It's not just on EQ.  Whether I'm playing EQ, getting laid, or making breakfast, I'm still snappy, egotistical, and honing the blade that is my wit.  Now *that* is more riveting and exciting to me than being just &quot;the bestest ranger.&quot;  <br>
<br>
I am, however, a cult leader.   <p>- Aishen L`Fey -<br>

It equates to you claiming I believe I am the best because of this line:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>
Aishen had nothing to do with your &quot;ownage&quot; of other people,some people just need to be shut up,and in this you never wronged me.It is actually your &quot;i'm the bestest ranger,and all rangers bow down to me&quot; attitude that got to me.<br>

<br>
Sorry, you don't slap me by saying I'm a bitch and delusional into thinking I might be the best ranger ever then get to add &quot;that's just how you come across as,&quot;  and expect to get away scot-free, freeing yourself from the consequences.  In essence, you called me an arrogant bitch.  Stand up for your goddamn opinions, and if you need a disclaimer to hide behind, you're not ready for some head-butting from people with real, formulated opinions.<br>
<br>
Your method of flaming is what I call the <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> hit and run.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
You attack someone (in my case, called me a bitch and pompous), add a disclaimer (i.e., &quot;that's just my opinion, not like it counts,&quot;  &quot;that's just how you come across as,&quot;  etc.)  to push all blame away from yourself, and when shit hits the fan, you pull out your disclaimer and you run.  That is a hit and run.<br>
<br>
Learn to take responsibility for what you say.  If you call someone a bitch, just call them a goddamn bitch and don't hide behind the usual 'hit and run' disclaimers.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Italics = the attack, or the 'hit' aspect of the flame </i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>

You may be able to dismiss it all easily because it's not your name getting used when you decide to practice name-calling.  I, however, am not.  And don't believe for one second you can intimidate me into stopping by adding this-<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>

<br>
-because that's bait I won't bite.  You didn't say &quot;Aishen you're a bitch&quot; or &quot;Aishen you think you're the best ranger,&quot; per se, but you sure as hell pointed to that in a rather unequivocal manner.  Just as you don't have to lie to mislead people, you don't have to say the exact words to point to something.  I'm not saying you were subtle in the least, though.  It was a direct assault without being completely blunt.  <br>
<br>
And do you know what communication is?  It's all about what people 'believe' other people said.  It's the nuances, tones, and innuendos that rule this game we call conversation- not the literal.  I can write a twenty page statement against someone and say he's a dumbass without actually saying, &quot;he's a dumbass.&quot;<br>
<br>
Also, if you're going to fuck with me because you believe I'm arrogant, then I reserve the right to fuck with you because I think you're not only arrogant but hypocritical.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>

<br>
So, somehow you're above it all because where others are egotistical you are not?  Why even mention it if you truly don't care about what other people think of you?  I find it funny that you make a point to make sure I know you don't need an ego to make yourself feel better, because it just bolsters your ego to know that you don't need one and the lesser people do.<br>
<br>
I like this one most of all-<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>
I have over 100 hours of pulling experience pre-buff fear<br>
<br>
I have 5 hours of post buff pulling exp, i stopped,cause from that point on,everything would aggro dt mobs.<br>
<br>
Makril says &quot;want me to pull draco? he right over there,i just cleared mobs in his path&quot;<br>
<br>
I taught myself to pull around golems(that dt'd) and cazic (that no longer does).<br>

Your skill is what makes you,not what people think of you.<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
&quot;Your skill is what makes you, not what people think of you,&quot; you quoted.  Well, obviously you're no shining example of that.  If you really didn't care what people think of you, I don't believe you would have posted all the self-glorifying bullshit before that line to make sure people know you're a skilled player and credible.<br>
<br>
That is called hypocrisy.<br>
<br>
There have been occasions I've been a bitch, yes, but I refuse to let myself be labeled as one unless the situation truly warrants it.  This situation does not qualify.<br>
<br>
Also, to touch base on your &quot;your skill is what makes you...&quot; comment, I'm going to have to disagree.  While skill is important, connections are just as important, and so is your reputation.  I can spout as much rhetoric as you can, but I'm not interested in preaching, so I'll leave it at that.<br>
<br>
You may believe I'm an arrogant bitch, but I suppose that's better than being an insecure hypocrite.<br>
<br>
And do yourself a favor- if you don't want to get involved in drawn out written duels, don't attack someone's persona and character and think it'll be over with quickly. <p>- Aishen L`Fey -<br>

The end game is *not* about your skill it's about your reputation and what *others* think your 'skill' is... and i don't want to be hated by everyone for something that happened a month ago.<br>
<br>
Alright maybe i will defend myself.  I was bored and pissed in that fateful Fear raid and i assumed i could pull a single mob, which i'm 90% sure my group alone could have handled.  i was probably wrong, and wasnt too sure... so i just sat there.  10 minutes later the raid folded.  i won't be going to fear again.  i hate that place.  <br>
<br>
Either before or after that, i had made myself a shadewood compound bow.  it was rilly fekkin nifty - 200 range with 150 range arrows i could lliterraly shoot across the length of KC.  which i was doing.  then a group got in trouble and pulled in front of me, and mezzed some mobs.  in front of my arrows.  I did not notice my arrows were hitting *their* mobs until about half a minute later (my sincere apologies).  Was my blonde-ness for thinking i could shoot *through* a mob and hit something 300 yards away.  again, i apologize, every time i practice archery i make sure i'm assisting someone, or, if i'm confused at *all* i *do not fire*.  and if they tell me to get the hell outta dodge, i bow out.<br>

And yea, i'm damn proud of the gear i have, and am going to brag about it.  But thats just me, i may be insecure and highly competitive.  i'm sorry.  But i don't recall ever saying i'm the best, either - just that i'm above average.  And as most people figured out - you can shut me up by refering to me as some kind of pet.  I get rather annoyed at this.  Silly me for thinking it'd be clever to name all my twinks after rockin' pets i've had.  Nothing else gets past the filters these days, anyway.<br>
<br>
Seriously,  i have nothing against any of you, and i hope you can forgive my weaknesses.  (considering seriously finding Aishen (is that your in-game name?) her Jade Reaver...i need one myself but can't even find the people to help with the corrupter in EK)<br>

If you feel like you have to brag about your equipment then you're an arse goblin.<br>
<br>
Why brag about your equipment? There is always going to be someone out there who has better gear than you, bragging about pixels is just senseless. <p><center><img src="http://www.users.bigpond.com/raymies/rolelen10.jpg">

<br>
Dwark seems to think i was owned,don't really see it,i see a long ass post,with lots of filler.<br>
<br>
Claim i called you a bitch,go ahead,i never did,cowardice? hardly,cowardice implies i should never post here again,laff,your a real piece of work if you think you can shut me up that easily.<br>
<br>
claim i used the &quot;fear statement&quot; as an ego boost and using it to prove i was &quot;credible&quot; yes it was an ego boost,think about it and you will understand.<br>
<br>
As for credibility,it had nothing to do with it,i have a tendency to type while i am thinking of other stuff,and what i orignally was typing,got mixed in with what my next thought was,weird,yeah,but happens when i have been up for over 24 hours.<br>
<br>
You did state some things that actually got me thinking,DO NOT READ INTO PEOPLE'S POSTS,you all know what that is,it;s when aishen typed this..<br>
<br>
&quot;Sorry,you don't slap me by saying i'm a bitch and delusional..&quot;<br>
<br>
and how about this<br>
<br>
&quot;in essense,you called me an arrogant bitch&quot;<br>
<br>
so saying you &quot;mouthed off in such a way as to come off as a bitch..&quot; is calling you a bitch directly to your face? and saying &quot;It is actually your 'i'm the bestest ranger,and all rangers bow down to me'attitude taht got to me&quot; is calling you arrogant and delusional? well maybe arrogant,yeah,you are that.<br>
<br>
well,this is a good flame,was hoping for one i wasn't part of,but i guess that is the cowardice in me,according to aishen,i like to &quot;hit and run&quot;,which is a cowards way.<br>
<br>
hmm,maybe you outta look into buying a dictionary dwarkarn,your a coward for not posting anything longer than 3 sentences,hey, hey now,i didn't call you a coward,aishen did,it's all in her &quot;hit and run&quot; tactics handbook.<br>

First of all, any paladins by nature of their class are excluded from severe beatings for making jokes about rangers.<br>
<br>
Secondly..in your example Aishen isn't that a bit like telling me I can't roll on a valorium breastplate because fairly soon I'll have a righteous breastplate?<br>

The fact is a CoF may well serve a ranger as long as anyone else. <p><CENTER><A HREF="http://ak.lonelygamer.com">
