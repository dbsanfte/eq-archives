Had over 28 people sign up excited to go... but two major flaws prevented us from going.<br><br>1. The wrong mix of people... i.e too much melee and not enough casters<br> (ya can't just beat the lizard down)<br><br>2. No experienced leadership<br>(I wasn't about to lead a horde of people to their deaths-better to have somebody that has done it successfully a few times lead a pickup. In my recruitment I discovered that there were plenty of people willing to go but no one willing to lead and those that have successfully downed VS before absolutely refused to assit - I guess VS is a &quot;members only&quot; type of mob.) <br><br><br>When I was recruiting for a VS Pick up it was obvious that there was big excitement for people to join up- but what was needed was a sort of shopping list of people required to down VS.<br><br>In other words we will need somebody who has successfully downed VS to post the count and class of people they had that did it.<br><br>Also keep in mind that with pick-up raids there are always more people needed just because of inexperience- so any shopping list of needed people should be almost doubled in pick up situations.<br><br>Just my 2cp<br>-Dunkamar<br><br>p.s. VS is on rotation as a courtesy between guilds- there is nothing preventing ambitious people from starting a pickup raid. I know this has sparked much debate in the past but fact is no one owns or polices mobs- this does not create chaos- Honestly, how many pick up raids do you think could 1- be successful and 2- if they were how would this be a bad thing?<br><br>More people getting to play uber mobs= more fun for all.<br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uiceweaselx.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ice Weasel X</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 296<br> <font color=#E9D756>(1/3/02 11:26:07 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=884.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: VS pickup slot - who's leading it?</span><hr size=1> Dunkk, the problem with just having constant pickup raids is that people may just completely do away with the rotation.

Remember, it only takes some of them a few minutes between zoning in and zoning out after the kill.<br><br>If pickup raids are just going to go FFA without following the same rotation that VS capable guilds do, I doubt every guild is going to just sit back and watch.

I may or may not move my raid to this new time.<br><br>If you're interested in joining, feel free to signup up here.  But let me be clear about this:  I already have almost as many players as I need so the odds of my needing to check this board for additional players is low.  Also levels below 52 are about 100% likely to not be invited.  I believe in the rule that if you come to help you get a roll, and I honestly don't think levels below 52 contribute that much to the fight.  In addition, killing VS requires a healthy complement of veterans in order to drop him, another reason I've gone to guilds that can't quite drop VS, but are close.  VS is not a place to be learning how to raid uber mobs.<br><br>That being said, I'll check here for additional players to fill in the ranks.  Post name, class, level and guild (or no guild if you are independent).  If you don't leave the info, I definately won't invite you along.<br><br>Some final words:<br>- I've got 3 wizards going already and don't plan on bringing any more.<br>- If you made it to the scammers board I don't think you're going <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>- If you are invited, the raid fee will be 30pp.  You can still come without paying the fee, but you will not be allowed rolls on any drops.<br>- If you don't like my rules, feel free to organize your own raid.  I have no problems racing to VS in this pickup slot, and if you (whichever PU raid leader may organize one) gets there first I will give you several chances to drop him before we go get him.  By first I mean there with sufficient numbers to kill him.  If I show up with my raid ready and see you've got just 6 players or an LD monk there, don't expect me to stop.<br>- I don't know the time we're heading in, and I'm not going to bother looking in posts to find what time others are going in.  I'll just show up and see whats up.  If you're invited you'll know the time.<br><br>Fyi, I don't plan on leading a raid during the next pickup slot, so don't worry about possibly missing this one - you'll get another chance guaranteed. <p>Bridgecrusher Dabashar<BR>56th Troll Myrmidon<BR>A Twist of Fate<BR></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ubirren.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Birren</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 113<br> <font color=#E9D756>(1/5/02 1:28:18 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=884.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: VS pickup slot - who's leading it?</span><hr size=1> I would like to join you Bridge.  55 warrior, currently non-guilded. <p>Birren Anklebiter<BR>55 Myrmidon </p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/bemarr.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=boum>Boum</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 77<br> <font color=#E9D756>(1/5/02 3:38:49 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=884.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Bah...</span><hr size=1> You got enough wizards...
