So I don't ask for outside help to clear fgs? So? That doesn't mean I didn't put the effort in. ANY cleric who camped solb previously, and now insists on camping the SF version, put in effort. You don't like the idea? Tough shit. Maybe you are the type who thinks the guild should do the camp work FOR the cleric, heh, sorry, I don't think that way either. Still doesn't mean I didn't put forth effort.<br>
<br>
After thinking it over a bit, I've come to 1 conclusion which I'm sticking with. As I said before, I was not 100% decided on my course of action. Afterall, why respect people's camps when they don't respect yours? It in no way has anything to do personally, for whichever cleric is currently camping RF. I'm using people as an all encompassing term. However, up to this day I still have never ks'd anyone, and I don't expect to. That being said, this is what will happen, at least as far as my epic is concerned. No one needs to fear being ks'd by my team, whoever may be in it, IF YOU ARE ENGAGED WITH SUFFICIENT FORCE TO DOWN HIM.<br>
<br>
If Ragefire pops, and I know about it, expect my team on the way. If my team is the first there, before the team for cleric camping it, you get 1 half hour from the time I get to the spawn, to get your people there, and 1 chance. Now thats speaking rather loosely, I might not find out RF is up for an hour after he pops, that gives you an hour and a half, thats more than *most* teams will give you. If your team is there in the allotted time, and engages, and DOES NOT WIPE, I will congratulate you on a job well done, and return another spawn. However, if you do wipe, I WILL finish the dragon. As sage said, guilds aren't charities, if you start to founder, do not expect my or my team's help. If my team is NOT the first there, you have as many chances as you can fit in, until I do get there, in which case, the above rule applies, 30 minutes from the time I get there, and 1 chance. That is provided some other guild decides you won't be able to kill it and snakes it out from under you, to keep it from despawning.<br>
<br>
It sounds harsh, but in the end, it does EQUAL my respecting the camp. Do whatever quoting or bashing you choose Kav. It also means that I expect and ACCEPT the same treatment from the other cleric teams needing Rage, on the far out chance I decide to subject myself to camping that insane spawn again.<br>

There are several different mobs for  epics that aren't triggered and still respected as a camp.  There are at least two in the enchanter epic, one being a very long camp as well.  I think the last enchanter that got it was there for over 120 hours. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ukavaren.showPublicProfile?language=EN>kavaren</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 135<br> <font color=#E9D756>(3/2/02 12:11:49 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3108.topic&index=43>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Is RF a camp or FFA!

<br>
You didn't put forth the effort NECESSARY.  That's self-evident, since you don't have the stick.  Why didn't you offer random_monk solo xp on the fgs, any loot that dropped, and a couple kpp or some items?  The FG's are only going to spawn at &quot;night&quot; twice max before ragefire pops, so do that twice and the stick is yours.  Show me a 50+ cleric on the server who wouldn't have given a level of xp to be in that position.  You had a golden opportunity and you pissed it away for no discernible reason.  That would be your loss, and your problem, and I wouldn't have cared one way or the other, but you came on here and expected sympathy for something completely avoidable and entirely your fault.  Boo Fucking Hoo.<br>

I then informed whoever read this post, of *my* situation, then proceeded to put out possible solutions, and then skipping past a few more posts, I put forth what I'm *going* to do.<br>
<br>
I am not asking for a break, I've always paid my own way, and done what I needed to do. Maybe if I was less stubborn and did as you suggested, I would have my stick. But I'm not, and I don't. And unfortunately, now I've got to deal with a whole new fucked up situation that NO cleric should have to deal with. I had the stamina for the old camp, simply not the patience. First thing I thought of when fg's started popping, and didn't see anyone from my guild online, was oh shit, especially with another team already moving to clear fgs. Ask any other cleric how logically they were thinking while they attempted the lair camp, and saw another team moving up, with none of their own backup. <br>
<br>
Whether you like it or not, the cleric epic means more to any cleric, than it does to the guild they wield it for. After enough time, the cleric simply stops caring who's toes get stepped on. &lt;shrugs&gt;We're only human.<br>

as for the FG, well in the few we have done in Affliction we discovered that *gasp* fire giants are on a 8 hour (actualy can be 7-9 hours) spawn. When we cleared them a bunch of us set our clocks to make sure we were on to help.<br>

maybe they just didn't want to come help you....<br>

Sol B was a camp this should be too and it should be respected, but of coarse if you fail then it should be fair game for the next team there.<br>

Furthermore as a European guild, nearly all our members work (not many euro players are students for a variety of reasons) and it is not possible for people to take an entire week off work with no guarantee of geting the camp or having it respected.<br>
<br>
This is what I suggest.<br>
<br>
Camps are time zone based. US guild camps Rage till midnight their time (or whenver their guild no longer has the strength to kill it) then hands over to an off peak guild - emjp, DG or AK. We then hold rage till our bedtime and pass it back to the same guild which passed it to us. This way no one has to stay up at night, the 'camp' system is preserved, and ragefire always pops to someone who is in a position to kill it. It also means that clerics can afford to have a life and go to work.<br>
<br>
If any guild wishes to work the system this way, we are happy to work with them.<br>

Don't give me any of this &quot;It's for an epic&quot; bullshit either. Its a mob that is random which the &quot;Camper&quot; had jack shit to do with the spawning. Sorry that sitting on your ass in SF for 3+ days sounds fun to you for an extra 10 minutes of gather time before someone else learns its up but that is all you get out of sitting at a random outdoor pop where you do not even have to clear dangerous mobs from your sitting area because none path close enough to aggro.<br>

I, for one, will NOT attempt to KS or even challange a Cleric who is sitting on the camp spot.  If it's not me sitting there, then it's not my Ragefire to worry about it.

Why is it nobody ever thinks they can be 'camped' just like a dungeon?<br>
<br>
Granted, I do not yet  know where Rageifre's new spawn spot in skyfire is.  Evidently there is a 'safe spot' you can sit and not agro anything, but I doubt you will see just one cleric sitting in the zone alone.  Respect the fact that they have a presence there and have put the time in to know when he is up and to mobilize to kill him.<br>
<br>
Heck, I've camped the golems and snakes near SSRA temple with a good friend many times and seen named ones pop only to have someone come along and grab it before we could kill the one we were on to get to the named, or had people move into the area and pull our spawns, etc.  This doesn't happen in dungeons.  Just because you can get to a spawn easier doesn't mean its a FFA.<br>
<br>
I for one support it being camped, and I'll do anything I can to assist anyone who finds themselves in the process of being ganked for the spawn after camping it.<br>

As for rule number one, that just means that the cleric gives his or her password to a friend so that someone else can hit the hotkey for &quot;Ragefire is camped!&quot;  Silly rule.<br>
<br>
It looks like everyone is still respecting rule number two for the moment.  Frankly, I have serious doubts about whether that rule is worthy of respect.  If you want to defend that rule, here are three questions that need to be answered:<br>
<br>
1. Some clerics simply cannot &quot;camp&quot; Ragefire in Skyfire for 5-6 days.  Why should those clerics be denied their chance at an epic?<br>
<br>
2. &quot;Camping&quot; Ragefire for 5-6 days is an incredibly stupid thing to be doing.  Why should someone be rewarded for doing something that is incredibly stupid?<br>
<br>
3. In order the &quot;camp&quot; Ragefire, a cleric merely needs to sit on his/her butt in a deserted section of Skyfire hitting a &quot;Camped&quot; hotkey.  Why does that make the camp worthy of respect?<br>
<br>
Adarian and Draelyn are making asses out of themselves, but I understand exactly where they're coming from.  It may be time to abolish the silly Ragefire camp.<br>

Celdor -- Very good analysis of the situation.  It started to quote the portion I agreed with, but then I realized that I was about to quote your whole post.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> There are several different mobs for epics that aren't triggered and still respected as a camp.

<br>
Actually, that sort of makes Adarian's point.  What is the difference between (1) claiming a mob from the safety of the zone in Kael or ToV, and (2) claiming a mob from a safe camp in a deserted section of Skyfire?  There isn't much reason to respect either one.<br>
<br>
On a different note --<br>
<br>
The single thing that bothers me most about the Ragefire camp is the concept of The List.  Cleric A is in Skyfire, and has promised to give the next camp to Cleric B, who will then give it to Cleric C, etc.  If nothing else, that cannot continue.  With a 5-6 day spawn, The List would mean that Ragefire is pre-claimed for weeks and months in advance.  The cozy arrangements that used to work in Sol B are out the window now.<br>
<br>
When and if I decide to go for Ragefire, don't even try to tell me that I need to get on a list.  If someone tries to invoke The List, I will laugh in their face.  If I'm feeling particularly pissy, I will let them camp it for six days, gank Ragefire from under their noses, and then tell them that they need to get on The KS List.<br>
<br>
Okay, the last bit was facetious, but understand this point: the fact that you are camping Ragefire now DOES NOT give you the right to promise the camp to anyone.  The fact that you start your camp immediately after someone else's Ragefire kill DOES NOT mean that someone else cannot come in and start a competing camp.  At the end of a six-day spawn period, no one is going to give a crap that you got there two hours earlier. <p>Sagemon Prayeth<BR>

I won't deny it, I posted all 3 of those things you quoted, but there was almost always more stated, at least on the 3rd statement, that informed! the camping cleric I wouldn't take their spawn under the circumstances I posted. If you wish, you can dredge them up too since you seem to enjoy digging through months old posts to make a point. As far as the first two statements, both referred to the fact that the lair would have to be empty for me to move in. Do me a favor and read between the lines before posting statements that seem like they can be taken out of context.<br>

<br>
And charisa...refer to Celdor's post as to why some people are fighting for Rage to be FFA. Has nothing to do with whether he *can* or *cannot* be camped. We all know you can park someone in sf/ej/dl and wait for the epic item dropping dragons to pop. The issue is *should* he be, and if he is, should it be respected, and to what degree/extent, and under what circumstances. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uadariansilverthorn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Adarian Silverthorn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 200<br> <font color=#E9D756>(3/3/02 11:29:08 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3108.topic&index=60>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Is RF a camp or FFA!

&quot;I would like to see you park a level 1 ranger or a 51 and 53 druid in NToV, Rhag, Statue, Vindi areas. Also, claiming mobs from the zone in is not really respected (and never has been). The only one where it would be is King Tormax.&quot;<br>
I didn't say I was gonna camp the characters at the spawn point of those mobs just somewhere safe to track from like zonein etc. Much less did you see the Joke and sarcasm part of my post. I was basically useing those spawns and parking a character there as an example of how silly claiming ragefire is when all you do is sit in a zone with no danger and wait for a spawn to occur and the fact that those camps if I did them would not be honered even though I did exacty the same work the ragefire cleric did.<br>
&quot;Psst, all mobs are on timers. There is no random spawn mobs.&quot;<br>
Psst Ragefire is on a timer too Shara. Its a bit more random then the others but all the mobs I mentioned have a random time factor to their spawn such as +-0-12 hours in addition to a set time like 3 days some more some less. So mob is 3 days +-0-12 hours so could be 2.5 days or 3.5 days. To me 1 day difference is makes it random not static like a exactly 3 day mob would be.<br>
&quot;lol, if this is your attitude now, I cant wait till they make the epic2's.&quot;<br>
Lvl 60 paladin here still not KoS to the Freeport guards cause I could give Two shits about my PoS epic which is inferior to my current weapon which does 130%+ of the epics damage including the proc. I doubt they will make the second epics better than 53/46 50/42 52/42 48/40 and if they do I still will prolly not care to put my guild and friends thru the effort to get it when we can wack a dragon/Snake or two and get something very equivalent. Highest hit so far with my piercer is 344 I think thats acceptable over the epic or even on par with what epic2 will be like at its best.<br>
<br>
Now Sagemon. Where did I make an ass out of myself please show me as I would like to know. If you are refering to the camp of torm etc. then I would refer you to the sarcasm and joke section of that post. Was useing those as an example of how sitting doing nothing until a mob pops is not reguarded as any claim to the mob by any of the guilds who sit here who are claiming sitting and doing nothing gives you claim to rage.<br>
<br>
Also Sagemon, Para is not of DG and does not speak for DG just as I do not speak for DG when I am on these boards but only speak for myself unless specified. She was once but I know of no characters of hers guilded within DG at all.<br>
<br>
&quot;There are a LOT less enchanters than clerics, and there is no single bottleneck for the quest like Ragefire. Just the same, I have seen Verina get ganked.&quot;<br>
The thing about Verina is that even though camping her really gives you no control of the spawn there is rarely even more than 1-2 people in that zone. This leaves it that the one cammping will most likely have enough head start that the 3-4 people they need to kill Verina will be there before anyone else even notices her up. Sometme there are two who see her up at the same time and then it just comes down to exactly what I Rage will come down to. Who gets the crew in first and since verina needs 3 people at lvl 60 if one is a cleric one is a tank and one is a chanter its usually resolved by who can get the 2 others there fast enough but usually only 1 person knows she is up due to the low population of this zone so not a problem very often. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showMessageRange?topicID=3108.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showMessageRange?topicID=3108.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a> <b>3</b> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showMessageRange?topicID=3108.topic&start=61&stop=80>4</a><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showMessageRange?topicID=3108.topic&start=81&stop=100>5</a><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showMessageRange?topicID=3108.topic&start=101&stop=120>6</a><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showMessageRange?topicID=3108.topic&start=121&stop=140>7</a><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showMessageRange?topicID=3108.topic&start=141&stop=160>8</a><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showMessageRange?topicID=3108.topic&start=161&stop=163>9</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showPrevMessage?topicID=3108.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showNextMessage?topicID=3108.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3108.topic&index=60><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/gfx/addReply1.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.emailToFriend?topicID=3108.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.threadControl?topicID=3108.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/deleteThreadFire.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=3108.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=3108.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub4.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="emarrmessageboardrules">Message Board Rules<option value="emarrlinks">Links<option value="emarrupcomingmmorpgs">Upcoming MMOG's<option value="emarrfrm18">America Under Attack<option value="emarrfrm19">Dark Age of Camelot<option value="emarrgeneral">General<option value="emarrfrm17">Funny Stuff<option value="emarrbazaar">Item Bazaar<option value="emarrscrollsnspells">Spell Bazaar<option value="emarrfrm15">Shiny Things<option value="emarrfrm14">Bargain Basement<option value="emarrfrm20">Crafter's Hideout<option value="emarrdragonsandplanes">Rants and Flames<option value="emarrfrm13">Dragons and Planes<option value="emarrroleplaying">Roleplaying<option value="emarrroleplayingoocforum">Roleplaying - OOC Forum<option value="emarrscammeralert">Scammer Alert<option value="emarrsignaturecorner">Test Forum<option value="emarrreallife">Real Life<option value="emarrothermmorpgs">Other MMOG's</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#E9D756>- </font><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/bemarr>Erollisi Marr, The Queen of Love</a><font color=#E9D756> - </font><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes>Rants and Flames</a> <font color=#E9D756> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- Begin BOTTOM AD Script -->
