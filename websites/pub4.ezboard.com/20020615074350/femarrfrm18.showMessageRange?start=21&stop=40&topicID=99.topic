First off...Mitch you can eata my Sh*t because although you did post what I said, you didn't post what I was replying to.  Second, never once did I make fun of or say this whole situation was funny.  This is a ROLEPLAYING GAME and I said what I said because I didn't want this invloved in it.  If you are going to segregate me because of my opinion on a real life situation then I don't want anything to do with you.  Yes, it is horrible that they died, but I was replying to someone who said I should be spending all of my time mourning for these people...I'm just not gonna do it.  They died, it's over.  It's horrible yes, but I'm not gonna spend all of my time talking or hearing about it.  You didn't see any of the tells I was getting and replying to...I replied to everything in ooc.  You guys are like preschoolers...You take something that is said, pass it on, until finally it ends up that I am Hitler and killed all the jews.  I won't have any of it.  Next, why would you take the word of a random person over the word of a guildmate??  Mitch, I didn't explain to you what happened but when I explained it to nameless others all I got was &quot;Well, this guy said you did this or said that.&quot;  It's bullsh*t and I'm done with it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ukrimnukem.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Krimnuk EM</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 20<br> <font color=#E9D756>(9/11/01 1:42:26 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=99.topic&index=22>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Some people who found todays atrocity funny READ-&gt;</span><hr size=1> w3rd out 'g<br>

I am betting that is exactly what the people who were flying the planes said as they were killing thousands of people Kill All of the Evil Americans, the young ones the old ones the children all of them.  So you saying what you did basically makes you the same as the ones that committed the crime.  Would you take an action such as killing a young child that had nothing to do with your problems simply for his race?  Maybe the world needs a few less people with closed minded narrow veiws such as yours.  I for one think it is sad that people feel they can simple state what ever they want and then not have the nuts to back up there statement.  I served in the US military, I have seen death and killing for no reason.  Its sad and its un called for if its commited by anyone regaurdless of race or realigion.  I am not passing judgment I honestly just wish the killing could stop but it wont I gaureentee it.<br>

Won't this statement look foolish if it turns out someone like North Korea was responsible, or maybe the IRA? Or Serbians? Even the news broadcast I was watching had a list of most likely candidates, some of which aren't even in the Middle East.<br>
<br>
Even though several of the Middle Eastern terrorist groups are the most likely candidates, there are others out there who could have done this just as easily as well.<br>
<br>
I do believe that whomever is responsible should receive the full punishment we can give them, but until we figure out who it was, we shouldn't lower ourselves to jumping to conclusions based on race or ethnic background. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/usaavakspiritwind.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Saavak Spiritwind</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.angelfire.com/tx4/saavak/images/Wolf.gif height=35 width=35" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>BazaarCop™</span><br>  Posts: 1097<br> <font color=#E9D756>(9/11/01 2:07:38 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=99.topic&index=29>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Some people who found todays atrocity funny READ-&gt;</span><hr size=1> Affro,<br>

You need to just watch what you say man.  Opinions voiced out like you did will offend many people in this tender situation.  That's fine if you choose not to mourn for all the deaths of innocent people.  But voicing that out /OOC makes you look very shallow &amp; will make everyone else think the same about you.  EQ is a game of personality &amp; reputation &amp; frankly, you just ruined yours.<br>
<br>
I myself try not to mourn for all the deaths out there that happen, but I do mourn for the fact that the people &amp; families left behind have to live the rest of their lives with the everlasting thought of why did it happen to my loved one.  I do thank god that it didn't happen to me or my family, but I give my deepest sympathies out to the ones who have been hurt by this the most.  <br>
<br>
Your description of 1 death every 7min or 7sec or whatever you said might not sound like much, but look at the great picture bud.  THOUSANDS of people just lost their lives in the most horrible way.  From being crushed, burned, or jumping out a window.  It is all horrible &amp; anyone who doesn't think that is a heartless SOB.<br>

       Suspicion for the attacks immediately fell on Osama bin Laden, a Saudi terrorist thought to be living in Afghanistan. An Arab-language newspaper in London recently said he had been planning an unprecedented attack on the United States.<br>
<br>
So even if he did not do the deed he was planning on doing something so while killing the true perp take this fuck-head out too.  <br>

You clearly are not a very intelligent individual. I don't mean to insult you; but saying your not going to feel sorry for the loss of someone you don't know is not just heartless, its illogical. <br>
<br>
Not to mention the fact that most likely upwards of 20,000 people just died a mere 9 hours before this post. You must know someone that knows someone who lost a loved one this morning. Calling people &quot;fucking morons&quot; for being in shock over an event that will change the world as we know it is grounds to get yourself killed. Try walking into a populated place in New York right now and cheering for the mass distruction that took place this morning and I would put my own life on the line to bet, that you would be beaten within an inch of your life if not killed and dismembered for your lack of morals. <br>
<br>
This isn't EQ.. those fire fighters and rescue teams don't have rez sticks, they are pulling out corpses from symbol of America that was destroyed by people who don't believe in the same things we believe in. How much more petty can someone get? &quot;I don't think you are right, so I'm gonna kill you and those around you&quot;<br>
<br>
Making the statements you made places you in the same category as those people. You deserve every bit of flak you get from this forum and people across the EQ community. You also need to check into a hospital because frankly.. you need serious help. <p><a href="http://home.directlink.net/~khaz/sf/lotte.htm">Lotte Xaenioc</a> - 60 bard<br>

Cibola, I have friends that are not Muslims, but of a certain Hindu sect. They wear turbans because they are not supposed to cut their hair. <br>
<br>
You cannot lump these guys in with the militant Muslims. I spoke with one of them today and he said we should eradicate the perpetrators off the face of the earth. <p>Research? What's that?<br>

I heard on the radio today that upwards of 300 rescue personell were in the second building, as well as the unknown amounts of civilians in and around.<br>
<br>
Certainly a sad day today, please keep these victims in your thoughts and prayers. They had no reason to die.<br>
If these cowards want a fight, attack our military not our innocent civilians.<br>
<br>
Whoever did this is probably disappointed with themselves actually. This attack could have been considerably worse, dont get me wrong its terrable regardless. But one of their main goals was to break down the moral of the US. They failed, instead they pissed off the most powerful nation and its many allies.<br>
<br>
Its not revenge anymore, its vengeance.<br>

<br>
What if, like the OK City bombing, we find out that... Americans were involved? <br>
<br>
I was shocked when I heard about Timothy McVeigh. An American committing terrorism in his own country?<br>
<br>
Could it have just happened again?<br>
<br>
I hope not.<br>
<br>
And to whoever said that we should just start beating the crap out of non-Americans in America simply because of their race... that is simply the biggest pile of shit I think I have ever heard. Stupidity, even worse than the individuals who acted out this tragedy. Even if we found out that an Arab terrorist group is responsible, we DO NOT go around harming Arabs living in our country. That's just stooping to the level of the terrorists. Guilt by association just does not apply here.<br>
