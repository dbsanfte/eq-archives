In any case I seem to have seen your name on rants like this quite a bit lately. I would think that by now you would have learnt that people have different ideas from you but it seems all you do in this situation is repeatedly post the same information over in the hope that everyone is suddenly going to agree with you despite you posting nothing new to make them think that way.<br>
<br>
Tell me where the line is. If people fail to kill a dragon should every guild stay clear until they make a zonewide announcement? Or should they just demand the loot off a mob they did not kill. The other guy took his turn at the mob and he failed. I don't see how failure entitles you to the loot but if you can give me one good reason why then please enlighten me.<br>
<br>
People will tell you this is a game. Others will tell you it's no excuse for forgetting the players behind the characters but it seems to me your idea is you claim the mob and thats it, you're entitled to whine then for any reason you see fit and every single time someone aggrieves you then you come running here.<br>
<br>
It's one thing to have a different idea of the way "it should work" but my problem cones from the fact that when it doesn't work the way you think it should that you have to persecute those that disagree with you. I think Voltaire had something to say on that subject.<br>
<br>
It's always seemed clear to me. There are server recognized camps and there are server recognized FFA mobs. I've been ganked on my fair share of mobs but it's never phased me because I know the rules and I respect them. I've certainly never felt the need to post here about those occasions. <br>
<br>
Personally if I look at the situation I would probably have just told the guy before he engaged that I was going to help him kill it but I'm not going to argue with those that don't see it my way. It seems to me that you have this "I'm here, I deserve everything" mentality. <p><CENTER><IMG SRC="http://www.plattsflello.com/ryn.gif" BORDER=0></A></CENTER></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/bemarr.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=razer>Razer</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 254<br> <font color=#E9D756>(9/17/02 2:13:42 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3634.topic&index=65>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: .</span><hr size=1> Kerryn, I made a post on Ragefire, and I made this post.

<br>
And yes, when I see someone do something I don't think is right, I don't shrug it off and let it pass, I like to let people know how other people are when they pull this BS.<br>
<br>
call me whatever you want over it, I just don't like seeing people get away with this stuff because someone else can't be bothered to raise a stink over it. You do noone but the person who ganked something from you a service when you let them do it.<br>
<br>
when the majority of people can agree that someone is camping a mob ahead of them, even if it is a FFA mob, I don't see why those who are too lazy to camp it properly should be allowed to continue doing what they do.<br>
<br>
Why is this FFA anyways? is it the fact that it's on an 18+/- timer and can skip that makes it FFA? it doesn't spawn randomly in the zone, it's static, why can't it be campable by someone? <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=138154"><img src="http://www.tbaytel.net/scaryf/images/everquest/razer.gif"></a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/udwarkarn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dwarkarn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 4576<br> <font color=#E9D756>(9/17/02 2:18:12 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3634.topic&index=66>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: .</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> So, if it's not against the rules, it's a-ok, no matter how anti-social or classless the act is?

I never said what Crypte did was a-ok, so don't try and say that I did. What I said was why bother saying he did nothing against the rules and then come here whining about it? That is simply pathetic. Blame the rules then, not the player. <p><center><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=6929">Rolelen Dwarkarn - 60 Warlord - Kind of retired, well maybe not I log on from time to time when masturbation gets boring</a><br>

Maybe it does more harm then good to post it here when someone does this.  I appreciate the info, but it truly doesn't solve anything.  Nothing is going to change over this.  Crypte is going to go on his merry way and that guy will be taking some time off EQ.  I can almost feel his frustration but when it happens to me, I don't bring it here because everyone will eventually call me a whiner and a dumbfvck anyway.  So, next time this happens Razer, bite your tongue, curse under your breath and let it go.  You'll be saving yourself a lot of the &quot;but it was an FFA mob&quot; arguments that seems to explain away any misbehavior. <p>Yalladar Valleycrest<BR>

<br>
Please expound on that comment. If I am incorrect the I apologize up front for misunderstanding your post. I just have a feeling this is going to get uglier before it get's better. <br>
<br>
Razer, while you may feel that Crypte slighted you or the original camper the truth as I see it is this. Your angry because your reality was not his. Who's to say honestly (for those of us who do not know you.) that you would not have done the exact same thing? Are we to believe that when #1 died you REALLY would have waited patiently after killing SF and let him loot it if you were the only person there? Only you can know this and the others of us are going to have to trust your sentiment here. <br>
<br>
I have no problem with you or your Guild. Matter of fact I thought we were on pretty good terms with your guild. My suggestion to you is this. Before coming to here to slam Crypte, maybe try contacting the guild (ToF) first and let the officers answer your questions. Coming here and slamming him or my guild for that matter I think is a little overkill. But then again you have come to the boards before lamenting about the injustices of EMARR. <br>
<br>
Sadly this game brings out the best and the worst of people. We can hide behind the avatars and be whatever we want to be. While I myself would have left the camp once I saw people there, I would not be that angry to come back and find my corpse on the ground and see SF gone. While it sucks to fail at anything, I would dust my sorry ass off and try again. Obviously we differ here. I applaud your sense of honor but question your motives, that's all. <br>

In your analogy above what Crypte did is called stealing and it is most definately against the rules. EQ and life are not the same in case you hadn't noticed. EQ is a game, you admitted Crypte hadn't broke the rules, so why whine?

<br>
My problem was with Crypte and Crypte alone. I did talk with one AToF who said that yes, Crypte is an ass usually. I don't hold AToF responsible for one members actions. <br>
<br>
This post was done with the intention of informing people like me that crypte did this and maybe other people might want to watch out for him in the future because he is known to not respect other people when it comes to camps like this when the majority does.<br>
<br>
Other people like Crypte can respond all they want and say he did nothign wrong. my posts won't do anything to change them and their posts won't do anything to change me, the only posts here that matter to me are the ones saying that yes, Crypte did wrong. I respond to those who don't agree with me because, well, this stuff is funny as hell in a pathetic sort of way, the way people try to justify being assholes. I'm bored while I camp storm, what else am I supposed to do right now? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/bemarr.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=razer>Razer</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 257<br> <font color=#E9D756>(9/17/02 3:18:43 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3634.topic&index=72>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: .</span><hr size=1> Dwark, do us all a favour and stop posting in my threads until you can come up with something worthwhile.<br>
<br>
you've reduced yourself to chief analogy destroyer for this server. pretty soon everyone is gonna start emailing their analogies to you before they post them so you can analyze them and point out every potential flaw.<br>
<br>
there is no perfect real world analogy to compare with things that go on in this game. Any 5th grade drop-out can read this stuff and pick out whatever flaws there are, but most can pick out the similarities while you discard it as garbage if it's not perfect, get a life.<br>
<br>
I don't care if you hate me, if you think what I post here about this is pointless. I don't care if you think I need to get a life.<br>
<br>
you reply with WAY more bullshit in regards to any eq related topic than anyone else, and you should be more worried about yourself than what I or anyone else chooses to &quot;whine&quot; about.<br>
<br>
I whine about stormfeather, you whine about me whining. Someone whines about you cause you whined about PoP having 5 more levels, and you whine about them whining about you. You're bored of EQ so you stopped playing, how long do we have to put up with the rest of your BS before you get bored of posting here? hopefully not too long.<br>
<br>
If you don't agree with what I post, stop reading it and stop replying to it. i don't go bitch about every post you make, so stop doing it to me and everyone else. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/udalamarndarkgem.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dalamarn Darkgem</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 592<br> <font color=#E9D756>(9/17/02 3:56:03 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3634.topic&index=73>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: .</span><hr size=1> /shrug<br>
<br>
Even if first guy got popped on the kill, Crypte still had one person ahead of him waiting.  Guildmembers coming here and saying I respect Crypte show support but that really doesn't have a damn thing to do with the issue does it?<br>
<br>
A VI rule wasn't broken but as stated before, this server is one of the best for common courtesy.  Obviously some people think they're above acting with honor and respect.  I try to keep track of people like this, KSers, ninja looters, camp stealers, etc. and have nothing to do with them.  People who act like this usually have it come back to haunt them when the only people who will help them are the other people who feel free to be an ass to others.  A group of 6 loot whores is a funny thing.  <br>
<br>
Let it go Razer, I'll help ya get the bird.  Everyone knows he acted like an ass so mission accomplished.  Move on and continue to accomplish and explore.<br>

Two rogues are looking for a group and we have an opening.<br>
<br>
Razer's the kind of rogue who will watch out for other party members and be helpful if one of us dies and a tricky CR needs to be done.<br>
<br>
Crypte's the kind of rogue who pick pockets from all the mobs and generally gives rogues a bad name.<br>
<br>
It's all playstyle, right? Nobody's breaking any rules, right?<br>
