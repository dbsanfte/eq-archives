<br>
Anyway, I've always enjoyed Mr. Cranky's reviews, but I was really impressed by the way he and his site staffers reflected on the Sept. 11th tragedies.  Although I have included all three posts, I was particulary impressed by the following sentiment: <br>
<br>
&quot;So where do we go from here? We have a rare opportunity before us: International shock and horror is already evolving into a valid and meaningful coalition. We could channel our anger into something far more valuable than making Afghanistan's rubble bounce. We could form a real and lasting anti-terrorism alliance, one which draws the line between countries that are part of the solution, and those that are part of the problem. Membership will be much sought and will entail both real benefits and real commitments -- intelligence sharing, military cooperation, extradition agreements, economic advantages. Not being in this group will entail real costs, not the least of which will be military in nature.&quot;<br>
<br>
*********************************<br>
<br>
I doubt my experience of this tragedy has been much different than anyone else's who wasn't directly affected by the events. I first heard what was going on via NPR while riding my bike to work. When I got to work, people were gathered around a television and we all watched in horror as the events unfolded in an order in which we are all now forever familiar. By the end of the day, I was discussing the subject with a friend. Among the things I saw were Palestinians dancing in the streets in celebration. My initial reaction to this and to the terrorist actions was that we should bomb somebody into oblivion. Be it Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan, or Palestine, if they wanted to celebrate the death of innocent people, then they could pay the price.<br>
My opinion about this matter has since shifted. I won't belabor the point too much. I think it's sufficient to say that we cannot live our lives in hatred or we will become that hatred. That is demonstrated all over the world every single day. Many people throughout the world wake up each day and think about who they can kill or how they can avoid being shot. If we allow ourselves to embrace that consciousness, we will cease living. We will become objects of hatred and hatred itself and hatred will consume us all the time.<br>
<br>
We should proceed carefully in what we say and what we do. We should methodically determine to the best of our ability who is responsible for this act and then determine the best way to bring those people and only those people to justice. Inflicting our hatred upon innocent civilians of countries that harbor terrorists or the innocent people within our own country will turn us into that which we so much despise. It will change our country in ways that we cannot fathom and it will be for the very worst.<br>
<br>
There are still so many things that come to mind. Had I lost somebody close to me, would I feel different? Can evil only be fought with evil? Will we ever find a solution to this problem?<br>
<br>
Believe it or not, Mr. Cranky was created, in part, to encourage dialogue, debate, argument, and a reconsideration of opinion. Certainly, it doesn't always work that way, but I hope that no matter what each individual's final decision about the solution to this tragedy may be, that they arrive at that place through a critical analysis of all the facts and all of their feelings.<br>
<br>
We've seen the worst of humanity and the best of humanity in a very short span of time. The way we react to these things may define both ourselves and our nation for the rest of our lives.<br>

<br>
The day Islamic extremists hijacked four planes in a devastating attack on the Pentagon and Twin Towers -- symbols which represent everything about America that offends them, like flush toilets and human rights for women -- America was left dazed in a wasteland of shock, disbelief and anger.<br>
<br>
Lots of anger. So much anger that -- in no time at all -- we even managed to scare ourselves. Already, anger is giving way to fear. Fear of the next attack, but also fear of ourselves, fear of what we're now capable of. Some say the first step to recovery is for America to check its anger.<br>
<br>
Here's an idea: Don't check your anger. If this doesn't make you angry, there's nothing that ever, ever will. The next time someone insists that the attack on the WTC was something we need to &quot;get over&quot; and move on from, just remember watching Tower 1 gasp its last breath on live TV and compound thousands of secretaries, executives, delivery men and firefighters into a slow-motion free-fall to their last terrifying moment on Earth. Remember the moment this stopped being simply scary and became an actual waking nightmare that changed everything you think about everything. Remember how you felt then, felt after, feel today, and use that feeling. Channel it. Put it to work. And never forget it.<br>
<br>
When Pearl Harbor was attacked -- America, one and all, was seriously fucking angry. We eventually channeled that anger into a victory over Germany and Japan. We also channeled that anger into the creation of Japanese internment camps which we regret to this day.<br>
<br>
Today, we're at a similar decision point. We've got a lot of fury to send somewhere.<br>
<br>
America seems to have decided that Afghanistan's going to get a great big dose of it. Great. The Russians gave that experience rave reviews. The problem with bombing the Taliban is that there's not much to bomb. We can't bomb their national treasures, because they've already destroyed them to placate their perverted vision of Allah. A box knife looks pretty silly in the cross-hairs of a billion-dollar stealth bomber. Perhaps we could just take their goat.<br>
<br>
The Palestinians are also likely to get a dose of it. While Arafat gave blood, his people celebrated in the streets. Maybe now we understand that Israel's problem with Arafat is not so much his explicit actions as his complicit impotence in the face of a situation that demands a leader who aspires to actually lead his people rather than bob around helplessly in their collective rage.<br>
<br>
Leading us through the crossroads is, ostensibly, George W. Bush. I'm not a commentator of any import or influence, so let me just embellish the urge to stand by our leader with a whispered observation: It's not helping things that GW looks like he's about to shit his pants. I just hope the citizens of Omaha felt reassured in the early hours of the crisis. They don't train you for this sort of thing when you're parlaying favors from Daddy's friends into tax breaks and baseball teams. You get real scared until you remember that Colin Powell's in the room. Powell was probably the one who said, &quot;Go to New York. Now.&quot;<br>

<br>
So much has been said in the past two days that anything I have to add seems almost redundant. But the one point I would still like to make is this: I think the terrorists' actions have backfired in some unanticipated ways.<br>
<br>
After the attack, in a matter of minutes, the people of this country became more galvanized than at any time since World War II. Partisan bickering dissolved in seconds. In New York, stores and restaurants threw open their doors to rescue workers. Strangers carried one another to safety -- or died trying. Blood banks instantly had donors lined up around the block. Amazon.com alone raised over three million dollars in 48 hours. In Australia, American Embassies are being overwhelmed with flowers. Buckingham Palace played the Star Spangled Banner during the Changing of the Guard. I heard one tale of a guy in Italy who had strangers walk up and hug him on the street when they found out he was American.<br>
<br>
Indeed, many of the very people the terrorists thought would celebrate their actions are instead appalled beyond words.<br>
<br>
America, to put it bluntly, is a basically a collective badass. The kind of country that, even when some ass-weasel sneaks up and clobbers her from behind with a lead pipe, stands back up. Spits out a bloody tooth. Rolls up her sleeves and shows everybody what she's made of.<br>
<br>
Our sleeves are rolled up, now, and I think what we are made of will prove nothing short of breathtaking.<br>
