The Riptide goblins have adopted a new king but are still in a vulnerable state until his subjects accept his rule. The Plasmatic Priesthood is aware of the weakened state of the Riptides and has convinced the Fire Peak goblins to strike against them. Although I do not agree with the mannerisms or actions of any goblin clan, such a war would be detrimental to all who are caught in its path. Lord Gimblox of the Fire Peak clan has been meeting with a member of the Plasmatic Priesthood in the Temple of Solusek Ro. Locate the Plasmatic Priest, hand him this statue to hinder his powers, then eliminate him and bring me his robe. <br>

However, there is yet another threat rising from the Plasmatic Priesthood that may have dire effects on all of Norrath if it is not stopped. An Iksar member of the Triumvirate missionaries has discovered that the Plasmatic Priesthood has somehow convinced the sarnak summoners of Chardok to assist them in summoning Ixiblat Fer to Norrath. Take this shell to Naxot Deepwater in the Burning Woods so that she knows I have sent you. We ask that you return with the Sceptre of Ixiblat Fer as well as evidence to show that the Plasmatic Priesthood is dealing with the sarnaks. High Priest Omat will await your return. I must depart for now.  I pray for your success. <br>
