<br>
That is the problem.  You believe they should be on the hook for problems they do not create. <br>
They should pay more for what you want government to do because they have more....they<br>
should be on the hook for more.  That is where the base disagreement exists.  You want the<br>
government to forcibly take their money in the form of taxes so that it is then &quot;our&quot; money to do<br>
what &quot;needs&quot; to be done.<br>
<br>
<br>
How about this, how about a law that says every artist needs to be forced to paint me one picture<br>
or sculpt one statue for me?  And none of that modern art crap.  I do not have the money to buy<br>
art, and you are so rich with artistic ability you can afford to do it because you can do it for free<br>
(or at least for cost).  Everyone should have their life enriched by art and that is the only fair way<br>
to do it since not everyone can afford to buy some.  How do you like that idea for a law?<br>
<br>
That is very similar to your position on paying for other &quot;needs.&quot;  Think about it for a minute,<br>
maybe it will come to you....<br>
<br>
<br>
“No you never said wealth was the number one factor in determining social value, but with a<br>
little observation and by deciphering words like lazy, whiners, when you refer to the lower<br>
classes, one can infer that.”<br>
<br>
You enjoy just making up and inferring stuff, huh?  What you should have read quite clearly is<br>
that those who are in the lower class who claim to they can make a 7 figure income if they<br>
wanted to do so but instead chose a lower paying profession because it is more fulfilling and then<br>
say that other people should pay their share of taxes since they don’t have as much money are<br>
greedy freeloaders and shows class envy.  You are very bad at inferring and generalizing, you<br>
should stop trying.  <br>
<br>
<br>
Also, going back and dong a search on each page, the only times I found the words lazy and<br>
whiner were in your posts.  And you used them like 6 times. Can you put aside your liberal<br>
propaganda manual for a minute or two and actually respond to what is said?<br>
<br>
&lt;insert general statement here about how the 2001 recession was the result of Clinton’s<br>
economic policies&gt;<br>
<br>
&lt;insert general statement here about how the 1981 recession was the result of Carter’s economic<br>
policies&gt;<br>
<br>
&lt;insert general conclusion here about how liberals don’t know the first thing about the economy<br>
since there were recessions at the conclusion of democratic administrations&gt;<br>
<br>
I can play the broad generalities game too. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
No, you shouldn’t get the majority say.  This is a Republic, not a Democracy.  Whether it is<br>
politically correct to state it or not, the truth is that our government is specifically designed to put<br>
more educated, responsible and SUCCESSFUL/ACCOMPLISHED/CAPABLE people in control<br>
of the decision making in order to keep “mass” rule from taking place.  If it were a true<br>
democracy then every couple of years 51% of the voters could get together and say that everyone<br>
who has more money than them should have their money confiscated and given to the<br>
51%....kind of where you head where your argument and where some Democrats would already<br>
have us if they could get away with it.  <br>
<br>
<br>
And your “employer or clients telling the you how to spend your check” example is, yet again,<br>
another completely baseless example.  Do you not see what an absolute foolish statement<br>
(although it does reflect typical liberal thinking) that is?  I EARN the money in my check from<br>
my clients or employer.  You do not EARN the money taken by the government and the<br>
government doesn’t EARN the money.  I should have control over the spending of money that I<br>
EARN.  This whole working for your money concept is really just beyond your capacity, isn’t it?  <br>
<br>
And this is a good time to point out your statement:<br>
<br>
“Unfortunately we (the bleeding hearts) can't bring up any issue involving money and the<br>
government without someone trying to pin the blame on welfare. I simply cannot believe people<br>
think that $415 of which less than $50 is probably abused is such a drain on the economy. They<br>
glance right over the $1388 per person that goes to corporations and stare at the $415. That $415<br>
includes school programs and help for the handicapped, the $1388 includes helping McDonald's<br>
promote McNuggets overseas, but does not include the tax credits Exxon gets for cleaning up<br>
their mess in Prince William Sound.”<br>
<br>
<br>
How can the difference here escape you? #1 - the $415 goes to millions of people, not a few<br>
thousand corporations and #2 YOU ARE COMPARING GIVING MONEY AWAY TO<br>
PEOPLE WHO DID NOT EARN IT TO SIMPLY NOT TAKING AWAY AS MUCH OF<br>
SOMEONE ELSE’S MONEY!!!!!  The corporations earn money and pay taxes and are given<br>
REDUCTIONS in the taxes that are forcibly taken away from them. “Corporate welfare” is not<br>
welfare, it is a reduction in corporate raping by taxation.  It is really very simple.<br>
<br>

What horrible record on minorities does Bush have?  That he doesn’t believe in giving them<br>
preferential treatment and discriminating against others in favor of them?  But yeah, I can see<br>
how your willingness to point out a perceived flaw in someone you hate anyway because he is<br>
not a liberal is real proof of your true concern of others.  That was sarcasm if you couldn’t tell<br>
from my tone. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
<br>
Again, you are the only one who has used the words lazy-whiner as near as I can tell, although I<br>
would certainly say that I would and could use those words to describe some people.  And maybe<br>
I did say that earlier, but I can’t find it. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>

I have no clue what you are trying to say in the devaluation paragraph and it appears that you<br>
have no clue either.  It sounds like you are making an argument against limitless printing of<br>
money because it will devalue the money and ruin the economy....&lt;shrug&gt; don’t know where that<br>
is coming from.<br>
<br>
<br>
Heh, good theory, take away the corporations money because they are a threat and then give<br>
some back to them if they prove that they behave how you want them to.....freedom at it’s best. <br>
Thanks, comrade, but I will pass on that type of society.<br>
<br>
<br>
“Hard work is it’s own reward” is a good moral theory but a terrible economic theory.  When will<br>
liberals quit trying to force their morality on everyone else?  Soon as you point out one<br>
conservative who has said that everyone who is not financially well to do are not successful or<br>
hard working then you will get one small bit of credibility.  You obviously have ABSOLUTELY<br>
NO CLUE what conservatives believe because you cannot even read written posts and respond<br>
without imagining slanders and biases.<br>
<br>
<br>
Here’s another chance for you:  The sky outside is blue.<br>
<br>
Will Ritt’s next post say “Those damn conservatives all believe the sky is green and that it is<br>
caused by not murdering enough minorities each day...?”<br>
<br>
Stay tuned....<br>

2. Class envy is an interesting topic.  After thinking about it a bit, I've decided that my problem is not class envy.  I come from a very wealthy background, and I don't recall the money making me any happier than I am now.<br>
3. I do think some professions are underpaid, yes.  "Teacher" comes immediately to mind.  These men and women spend day in and day out trying to expand the minds and opportunities of children for so little pay that many of them are on food stamps.  (Especially those in the public school system.)  Yet they continue to do it.  I think they deserve  more money -- if teaching paid more, we wouldn't have the dearth of teachers we do now.  Overworked and underpaid, but I guess there must be some reason they do it....<br>

<br>
Underpaid is a relative term. If you believe they are underpaid in an &quot;economic&quot; sense, then that wouldn't be the case. In the most extreme economics, no one is underpaid (and no one is overpaid). Supply of labour will equal the demand for labour. <br>
<br>
Look at the amount of people applying for teachers college. It's mind boggling. That's why teachers salaries are so low.<br>
<br>
Why are lawyers salaries so high? Because they restrict entry by BAR exams etc, and restrict the entrance of lawyers into the field.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> I should have control over the spending of money that I EARN. This whole working for your money concept is really just beyond your capacity, isn’t it? <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
If everyone has control over every dollar they earn, then there's gonna be a heck of a lot of people who are starving to death. Re-distrubtion of income is a necessaity. And not only does it have economic benefits, it also has cultural, social, and demographic benefits as well.<br>

<br>
Your artist law is a perfect example of your obvious inability to comprehend the tax system. If an artist is in a 50% tax bracket basically he is creating one work for the government the next for himself.  Stephen King talked about this in the beginning of a collection of his short stories. Someone pointed out to him how he was virtually losing money because when he wrote short stories, but he said they were things he felt like doing so he did. The government doesn't tell the CEOs how much they are going to need and then let them decide how they are going to make that much. It taxes them, just as the artist by how much they make. Even these superfund taxes, when you look at them actually, are like that. The governement takes into account several things like income and potential environmental risks.  I never said anyone should pay my share of taxes. Explain to me how the cleanup of  a chemical used in a product that might not even be sold in my country/state/county is rightfully my share that I am trying to dodge. NOW EXPLAIN TO ME IS IT EASIER TO GIVE TAX BREAKS TO ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY COUNTRIES OR ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY INDIVIDUALS. <br>
<br>
I did not say I earned it I said the government earned it and I should have, as this nation was designed, as much say as anyone else who can votein how it is spent.  I don't want to offend you anyfurther by jumping to conclusions you seem loathe to invalidate, so do you believe, as I have heard some foolish people say, that the government does not provide services to you?  Oh wait you did say the government does not earn its money.  Do you truly believe  this? <br>
<br>
Apparently you didn't read my thing on the corporate welfare vs social welfare.  The numbers are how much each person pays in, on average for each service. It isn't how much each recipient averages. Makes the numbers look different huh?  You see I pointed out that the corporate welfare does not include tax breaks, even those like the Prince William Cleanup. In fact you quote that section and then say that corporate welfare IS in my examples, tax cuts. It is very simple if you can understand words in the order they are strong together. <br>
<br>
No, I don't have concern for Bush. I might have given a crap, about him once, but after the governors were calling moratoriums on the death penalty and investigations were placed on death sentences, he shut down the investigations, went out of his way to do so.  Grinned and said I believe they are all guilty that have been found so.  Even as day after day DNA testing was releasing people on death row.  The uppity negroes part was actuall a quote of his in regards to a black lead PAC group. That man should learn to know when cameras are rolling and tape machines are on. Even if reporters are&quot; a$$holes&quot;, or if he feels the need to brag to a foriegn dignitary that &quot;I can't believe I won. I was running against peace, prosperity and incumbency.&quot; he should remember we will quote him on it later.  What is the definition of &quot;is&quot; anyway.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Waaaa....&quot; I perhaps took out of context. Perhaps that was meant to be us liberal's mating call? Or was that an alliterative whine?  <br>
<br>
The devaluation part was addressed to andmun. I was interested in hearing his theories on those theories, because he seemed to have a very real grasp on economics.<br>
<br>
<br>
BTW Zariel...I have read a few of your posts and think you got a good grip on things. Wanna you know waaaaaaa waaaaaaaa waaaaaaaaaa<br>

<br>
Either one of two things, sites don't get cleaned properly or at all or....yup raise in taxes or cut in other programs. Since we are in a state of national emergency we will most likely not scale back any military or bureaucratic waste, even if star wars doesn't work on paper even yet and is a violation of a few treaties &quot;we need it now more than ever&quot;. Even though it WOULD NOT have prevented any of the tragedy of S11. So either the cuts come from social reform programs or a tax raise, which will come through a democratic Senate. Come election time every conservative is going to be pointing those propsed tax hikes out while completely denying they were the result of it. I bet the Democrats are stupid enough to set themselves up for this. <br>

Tell me, if the number of people going to "teacher college" (whatever that is) is so mind-boggling, why do we have such a dearth of teachers?  What are we doing with all these spare teachers?  If we have so many teachers, yhy are school districts desperate for subs?  I live in one of the best 100 school districts in the United States -- why is there no one to fill the empty post of 3rd grade teacher at one of the local elementary schools?  Why is there no Middle School Librarian?  I'll tell you why -- because there are so few teachers!<br>
Now, as for teachers vs. lawyers, I have a first-hand view on that.  My mother is a teacher.  My father is a lawyer.  Both are directly responsible for hiring.  In a single year, my father turns away more hopefull associates than my mother has seen applicants in her entire career.  That's because there are oh-so-many teachers and oh-so-few lawyers, you see.<br>

Because we don't pay them enough. Being a secretary for some business is a lot less stressful and usually a lot better pay. <br>

I was struck by the similarities between Jack Welch and my grandfather, Walter Hoving, chairman of Tiffany &amp; Co. for 25 years. I was also struck by the differences. I wondered what Walter Hoving would have done if he had been told his company was responsible for creating 81 toxic Superfund sites across the U.S. through PCB contamination.<br>
<br>
Would he have launched a public-relations campaign downplaying the toxicity of fish tainted with PCBs, a compound banned worldwide? Would he have spent large amounts of shareholder money on a lobbying campaign to amend the federal Superfund law to limit industry liability for the costs of toxic cleanups?<br>
<br>
I think not. My grandfather's sense of responsibility to the country he loved included a moral conviction to do what is right. Welch epitomizes the stereotypical corporate leader whose sense of responsibility is driven by the short-term bottom line. The things that inspire many of today's business leaders to greatness are a sad departure from what made business leaders great in my grandfather's time.<br>

Hmm... guess superfund isn't just about screwing the rich. It seems a wealthy person here is supporting it. 81 superfund sites! Some estimates say Welch is responsible for 62 some say 85 any which way that is a lot of cleanup. Perhaps that amount of environmental destruction is the price to pay, for under Welch's watch GE rose form a worth of 12 billion to a worth of 280 billion. Think of all those jobs that money probably created, right Cenelron? But, wait......there's more....Yes during his reign Jack Welch magaged to cut GE's American workforce by 50%. During the Clinton administration Welch was one of the primary critics of Superfund laws. Who can blame him? If forced to pay for their clean ups GE might not have been able to pay his $94000000 a year salary or any of his benefits. (Wonder if those included all you can eat Hudson river fish?) He filed so many fraudulent lawsuits against the government for enforcing rules against him that GE lost its contracts with the U.S. government. Yay Lobbyist. <br>

<br>
It also bears noting that while there may in fact be more people going to college to become teachers than lawyers, our society needs many more teachers than lawyers.  Consider just how many schools exist in this country and how many teachers it takes to operate even a small school, versus the number of law firms and the number of lawyers it takes to operate one. <p>Arikel, n00b thane of The Grey Legion <BR>

Fire fighters in this country make 2/3 of what a teacher makes IF that, maybe 1/2 in some cases.When I watch the news, I see teacher strikes every few weeks or so.It happened here 2 years ago.<br>

IMO,Teachers make okay money, enough to get by,but they also complain about not being paid enough.Fire fighting is a more rigorous job,get paid less,yet, most do not complain.Why you may ask?Because the men and women love their jobs and what they do.If you truly love your job, ANY money you make should be a bonus (After the amount you have to get by in life).<br>

In other news, teachers in the northeast who have 15 children are considered in poverty and qualify for welfare....proof positive that teachers are underpaid.<br>
<br>
In most places there are generally only shortages of teachers in specific (science and math) areas.  That's because it takes a person with half a brain to teach those subjects and teachers with half a brain are rather scarce.<br>
<br>
My father was a teacher, my sister is a teacher, my wife was a speech pathologist in the school systems.  MOST teachers do not complain about the pay because they work, on average, every other day and get full benefits and their schedules coincide with the schedules of their children.  That's one of the main reasons people take the job.  The biggest problem teachers have are liberals who screw up the system with indoctrination programs and who tie their hands from teaching those that will learn by burdening them with those that refuse to learn.<br>
<br>
Oh, and I'm a lawyer...yes we should get rid of half of them (but not the half that I'm in <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ) because the majority of them are liberals and I don't like sharing the business.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

And the reason we have so many lawyers and lawsuits is there are too many people looking for a free ride (like some people posting to this thread) and always wanna sue to get some money or sue to keep those damn Republicans from using their land as they see fit.<br>
<br>
The Superfund is a tremendous waste of other people's money.
