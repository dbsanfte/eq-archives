<br>
I guess we'll just have a difference of opinion on this one, because I still fail to see Starbucks, the corporation, as doing wrong in this situation.  For me, this situation, like many others, goes back to one statement:<br>
<br>
Under no circumstances (even as horrific as the WTC bombing), can one man's need justify a claim on another man's (or entity's) ability (including money, resources, etc.).<br>
<br>
While I, like most people in this country, would have given the worker the water, that is a decision I make for myself.  For me to say that a person or business must 'give' away their resources, regardless of cause, would make me a communist.<br>
<br>
Did they make a bad business decision by not rectifying the situation immediately?  Probably.  But it was well within their moral rights to charge for the water IMHO.  If consumers want to penalize them for not giving away water, that is their right, but I really do think folks should think about the statement above first...<br>
<br>
Not to anyone in particular,<br>
If anyone has a problem understanding the implications of what happens when one man's need IS allowed to present a claim on another man, think slavery, it's really that simple.<br>
<br>
Gar<br>
<br>
PS.  Back to Cao, hehe, if they hadn't had the money, they probably would have gone to another establishment that wouldn't have charged them.  When people need something badly enough, they find a way to get it, in my experience. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uraedwulf.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Raedwulf</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 313<br> <font color=#E9D756>(10/5/01 9:42:31 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=209.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Well...</span><hr size=1> The Starbucks' lackey made a bad decision.  He's a fucking cashier, not someone used to making business and marketting decisions, and he made the wrong one.<br>
<br>
When Starbucks Customer Service was contacted, they clearly thought the story sounded so incredibly dumb, that they didn't believe it.  Again, front line customer service folks don't have a lot of authority, and aren't used to making such decisions.  <br>
<br>
My wife used to manage a customer service department for a mega-bank, and the folks that answer the phone usually can't find their ass with both hands.  That's why I always ask for a supervisor.  Usually you won't really get one, but at least you are more likely to get one of the sharper folks on the floor or get your request moved up in the cue.<br>
<br>
Starbucks made a big mistake.  Well, two of their dimmer employees did.  Blaming the whole company for the mistakes of a few high school grads is hardly fair. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ucaoilfhionn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Caoilfhionn</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Erotic, exotic & a little psychotic</span><br>  Posts: 541<br> <font color=#E9D756>(10/5/01 3:39:12 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=209.topic&index=8>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.altdzin.com/tgl/cao.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Well...</span><hr size=1> blaming the company for the actions of it's employees is MORE than fair.<br>
<br>
If it didn't work that way, companies would never bother to fix their mistakes, why bother, there's no repercussions.<br>
<br>
Case in point:<br>
<br>
I have not purchased Exxon/Mobil (now mobil too since the merge), based on their refusal to pay the clean up costs for their screw up with the Valdez.  That, in my opinion, showed an incredible lack of what I consider community concern.  You can rate your companies on whatever criteria you choose to, but I include &quot;community issues&quot; in how I rate a company.  <br>
<br>
I recently changed my Exxon opinion, when they were the ONLY gas station in town to not raise prices in the confusion following the attack.  Based on that, I gave them some credit they never had previously.  <br>
<br>
Therefore, I can and will withhold my business from Starbucks.  <br>
<br>
I've written them a letter, they know how I feel.  It may make a difference on how their employees are trained in the future.  I may not buy Starbucks for a month or a year, however long I feel, but take it from me, the starbucks guys locally WILL know I'm not there.  I buy that much coffee.<br>

However, decisions at the top and the bottom are quite different.  Exxon made a corporate decision to abandon their screw-up, while RJR insists on killing people and marketting to children.  The Starbucks situation is quite different.  Lower level peons made poor decisions which they were never trained to address.  The cashier was clearly in over his head and afraid for his job if he gave away over $100 in product.  The CS rep was just stupid.  I don't think either of their conduct warrants boycotting the company, for as soon as the execs found out about the situation, they corrected it.  Big difference between Exxon and Starbucks. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ucaoilfhionn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Caoilfhionn</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Erotic, exotic & a little psychotic</span><br>  Posts: 547<br> <font color=#E9D756>(10/6/01 10:48:45 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=209.topic&index=10>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.altdzin.com/tgl/cao.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Well...</span><hr size=1> you missed a point, Raed.<br>
<br>
Journalists *CALLED* starbucks about the situation and were ignored.  It was not until massive amounts of media and email targetted the actions of the company that they decided to fix it.<br>
<br>
What I dislike about their actions is this:<br>
<br>
It should have been corrected because they felt the wrong action had been taken rather than a media blitz forcing them to take action and correct it for fear of &quot;not looking good&quot;<br>
<br>
I don't blame the action of the cashier, re-read my posts.  He did what he thought he had to do, it's not what I would have done, but he made a choice, based on how he perceived his company would want him to act.<br>
<br>
I work in a company that has a huge customer service base.  In fact, I provide the training and the knowledge that they take to the lines with them.  Take it from me, everyone who leaves my class after knows damn well if they told someone &quot;that would never happen&quot; and dismissing a complaint would find themselves jobless in a minute.<br>
<br>
But, even dismissing the actions of the cashier, and forgiving the stupidity of the CS rep, the fact remains that other folks went straight to the PR dept and the president and didn't get a response til news reports were actually published.  <br>
<br>
Shame, Starbucks could have resolved this much earlier than they did, they chose not to until it had the potential to make them look bad.<br>
