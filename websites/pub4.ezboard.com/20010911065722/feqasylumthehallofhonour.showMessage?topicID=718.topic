He is always ready to drop everything and assist a friend in any way he can.  Arithos organizes raids for no benefit of his own, but for the enjoyment of others on a regular basis.  He always has the patience needed to sort out problems during the raids, and a superb attitude while gaming in general.  This dark elf has put up with a lot from me personally; requests for arrow summonings, pestering tells during raids (which I may or may not be a part of), my screw ups and venting now and then, and yet more arrow summonings.  He does all of this with an upbeat attitude.<br>
<br>
For all of his hard work and his happy persona, he deserves to be up here, but todays actions took the cake.  After weeks of seeking a Tolan's Darkwood Bracer, he lived on four hours of sleep and sacrificed an hour of his work-life to acquire for me my most wanted possession.  He didn't ask for a single item towards the cost (though I am darn well going to find a way to repay you Arithos) and handed the bracer to me without requesting any payment.  (Mages around Norrath rejoice.  You shall hear no more request for arrows from me.)<br>
<br>
For your raiding skills, your generosity and your friendship, you now find yourself on the Hall of Honour, Arithos.<br>

Sheesh, I can't really top that.  Ari, you are everything a guildmate could hope for.  Honest, honorable, selfless, hard working, inventive, resourceful, inspiring...blah blah blah.<br>

I can honestly say that I've never met a player more deserving of a Hall of Honor posting than Arithos.  Seriously.  You're the shit.

What can I say?<br>
<br>
The night he created an ungodly number of mana vials for a guild member trying to get their tailoring up to do the erudite cultural smithing.<br>
<br>
The night he spent running around making me armour at the last minute so that I could have a suit of Mourning before the funeral of a departed friend.<br>
<br>
His willingness to be there and help those who need him.<br>
<br>
Always a friend smile and wave.<br>

<br>
When he joined the Bears a long time ago I was so impressed by him that I officially adopted him as my in-game 'lil brother (too bad I got all the looks <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ).  Was just goofing around at the time but it kinda stuck, and now this little darkie is someone I'll always be proud to call my bro.<br>
<br>
Rather than just repeat everything that's already been said, let me just add one more thing that really shows why this guy stands out.  Arithos lives in Singapore and almost everyone else in our guild are in the US or Canada.  What this means is that 8 pm for 90% of us is pretty much 8 am the following morning for him.  Even as this guild grew, 5 days out of 7 were spent by him on-line with perhaps only 2 or 3 other guildies that played the same hours.  Through all this he stuck with us and continued to play a major role within the guild.  Even today most of us are lucky if we get to see him in-game 2 nights a week, and yet he still makes a far greater impact in this guild than I ever will.  He leads raids, he helps people on quests, does tailoring and blacksmithing for people (usually sacrificing much of his play time to do this), and I could go on and on about his unselfishness.  Hmmm what's he doing this weekend?  Well he has an Ixiblat raid scheduled Friday for one of our clerics and a spawned Trak raid on Saturday to help Riain finish his epic....what a surprise <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Never once has anything bad or dishartening ever occurred.  He is without a doubt, on of the most honor filled people on the server.  Many, many times he will sacrifice loot, time, effort, just to help.  Try to give him something and he says &quot;No thanks bro )&quot;<br>
<br>
He is one of those people on my short list that I would drop anything to go help if he asked or needed it.<br>
<br>
Farming haze panthers for his tailoring, he gives me the eyes for attempts at the tinkered cloak.  Never once has he asked anything for them.  Well, he did say he wanted a cloak. )<br>

 Arithos is one of those people that if you open your eyes and heart has a lot that he can teach you. Not from being smarter or wiser than you, but just by being himself. He is by far one of the most giving people that I have ever come into contact with.  His heart is large and warm, he takes most everyone into his world and shares of himself, which is the greatest gift of all.<br>
Arithos, I salute and raise tribute to you.<br>

I can say this though... ever since we did meet, and actually got to know eachother... he has easily been one of the best friends I have EVER had in EQ.  I have never, ever, met a more selfless individual.  He is Kind, giving, helpful, considerate, and as I said... one of the best friends anyone could ask for.  I can't count the number of times I've been frustrated, pissed off, or just a little down... and he has made me smile not just about the game, but IRL.<br>
Anyone who has been fortunate enough to meet this guy, already knows all these things.  If you haven't met it him yet, make it a point to.  People like him are few and far between.<br>
