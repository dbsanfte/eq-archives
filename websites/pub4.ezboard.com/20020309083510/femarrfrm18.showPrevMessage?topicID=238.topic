Trying to make weak statements written boldly (but very &quot;pretty&quot; btw) makes you look more juvenile/silly than respectable.<br><br>Your description of evil, &quot;(for the following, evil is defined as an action meant to benefit the individual while effecting the many)&quot; has very little to do with evil.  Such an open statement also describes charity, benevolence, selfishness, patriotism, almost all intentions...etc.  There are very few things people can do (whether beneficial or not) that don't affect &quot;the many&quot;, whoever &quot;the many&quot; are.  Someone can express themself through poetry, touching millions of people.  Is expressing themself considered evil in this example?<br><br>Christianity and Islam are cults only by strict definition of them having devoted worshippers of their religion.  Both are highly tolerant and promote love-your-fellow-man (sorry, I don't have the correct term at this hour) goodness.  If you're using the term &quot;cult&quot; with negative stigma attached to it due to the history of a few overzealous extremist groups giving their organizations a bad image, then you're weak minded and extremist yourself.  The taliban is to Islam as the KKK is to Christianity.  Real Christians and Muslims would distance themselves with those extremists.  Their teachings are so far off to be split into completely separate groups.  Weak, feeble, cheap attempt at getting a popular thread by mentioning religion.<br><br>Obviously you're short-sighted:<br>&quot;-Osama Bin Laden shouldn't be our sole target...unless, of course, revenge is our only goal. &quot;<br><br>Terrorists' main weapon is threat.  People fear their threats and that gives them power, more power than actually launching an attack.  They have the power of control when their enemy is in fear, crippling the economy and lowering confidence/morale all at the cost of a video tape.  But before their threats are taken seriously, they have to show the ability to carry it out.  Same thing applies to our war on terrorism.  By showing zero tolerance for terrorism and the total obliteration of their organization, financially and physically, the U.S. is *preventing* future terrorist attacks.  The ability to carry out a terrorist attack relies heavily on their resolve, and the message the U.S. is sending out is lowering that resolve for other groups.  If you've been reading the news in the past few months, that's the message being sent out by Bush and other world leaders.  It's the same thing as the &quot;this is your brain, this is your brain on drugs commercial&quot;...if you choose to do X action, you will get yourself hurt.  So no, bin Laden is *not* our sole target.  Prevention is much better than reaction.<br><br>Hrm, I didn't want to write this much at 6am, but this little nugget of yours was a nice bonus and I just *have* to point it out to you:<br><br>&quot;-Those who neither follow nor lead may as well not exist.<br>-Someone get rid of Saddam already.&quot;<br><br><!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ueqwolfran.showPublicProfile?language=EN>EQWolfran</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#E9D756>(1/1/02 6:16:21 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=259.topic&index=4>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Okay...please discuss</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> What a bright, happy view of existence you hold, where all must either be slaves or masters in order to live fulfilled lives.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br><br>A Leader != a master<br>A follower != a slave<br><br>And you can always be both.

I think you knew the intent of my remark about questioning..  By what you say, however, the weak and feeble minded deserve to be stepped on in order to enact progress.  Who's progress would that be? Oh right, the quick thinking... <br><br>I agree scrutiny should occur in order to puport any stance, majority or minority.  Again, I'd like to think you know what I was getting at, however:  Herds of men are not sheep, they are mobs, and many a mob has tortured, killed or otherwise persecuted the minority.  There is a tendency of a majority rule to impose its own standards and beliefs because it can, it has the power.  All I'm saying is that just because you're in the majority doesn't mean you have the right to impose yourself on the minority whimsically; that is, think before you act as part of the majority/mob.  <br><br>My point about the media... Let me break this down:<br><br>1) The mass media today is ultimately driven by the need for capitalistic success since, after all, they take part in a capitalistic society.  <br><br>2) People will only choose to invest in these outlets if they believe that people will watch the commercials (in TVs case) or see the ads (in the case of newspapers and magazines).  If people don't want to see what the news reports then they choose not to look at either of these things, hence no money for the company publishing said news reports. <br><br>3) Even if you throw out the need for ads in newspapers or magazines, let's say, you still have the need for a journalistic institution to SELL copies of its reporting in order to continue operating.<br>    -  (Case in point, Time chose Guiliani as man of the year over Osama Bin Laden. Why? No one        would buy a magazine with Osama Bin Laden on the cover...)  <br><br>Conclusion: The masses control, at least to a noticeable extent, the content of journalism today, most especially in broadcast media.  <br><br>This is, I suppose, not the end of the world, but certainly doesn't help the cause of conveying accurate, factual and unadulterated events in the world.  Think of it more this way: The moment we stop allowing a completely unbiased reporting of events (despite the possible addition of commentary that is clearly non factual - Wolf Blitzer included) is when we begin to tread on the grounds of propaganda.  Do I claim US news is unbiased? Nope.  To this day we won't show a dead American on the evening news but we have no problem showing dead Rwandans, Serbians, Afghans, etc... Why not? Americans wouldn't stomach it.<br><br>Anyway:<br><!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>I happen to think it's a good thing that little peabrains have to break a sweat and question the majority opinion.

It can interfere in the reporting of the truth, the validity of which the masses can't change but the masses can change the channel, and the media loses money.  The solution??<br><br>There are two solutions really:  1 - People don't change the channel when they see something they don't want to accept as a real part of the world or, 2 - We find a way to take the media out of the capitalistic regime.  <br><br>For the most part method 2 has been practiced by journalists for centuries by a self-imposed adherance to seeking and reporting the truth, asking the hard questions, and being predominantly a facilitator of the relationship between people and the world.  Lately, however, journalists are increasingly abandoning this mantra in order to keep ratings, readers, viewers, sponsors, etc. <br><br>None-the-less, the inherent problem is due to the relationship between the media and capitalism.  <br><br>I DO believe we live in a free republic, but I also believe that a prerequisite to being free is seeing the truth for what it is, no matter the consequences.<br><br>Back to the confusion...

No more business for you! Soon your company will be out of business.&quot;<br>Kyth: &quot;I doubt it. Everyone loves vanilla. We make bank on vanilla.&quot;<br>Glade: &quot;The government should regulate you people, to make sure all 31 flavors are offered!&quot;<br>Kyth: &quot;I'm certain that under government regulation, the presentation of all flavors will be fair and unbiased. And monkeys might fly out of my butt.&quot;<br>Glade: &quot;You have a moral obligation to give me pistachio!&quot;<br>Kyth: &quot;Vanilla is where the money is, and I need to pay dairy farmers for their product, and employees for their time. Judeo-Christian morality doesn't really come into it. Sorry.&quot;<br>Glade: &quot;Well, how the hell do I get the flavor that I want?&quot;<br>Kyth: &quot;Well, sir, if you were to borrow my scooper and leap over this counter, I suppose you could help yourself.&quot;<br>Glade: &quot;Huh? But that would be anarchy! Soon, everyone would do it.&quot;<br>Kyth: &quot;Indeed. Who knows what might happen.&quot;<br>Glade: &quot;That's crazy!&quot;<br>Kyth: &quot;I know. Entire legions of people taking responsibility for their own ice cream. Insanity. Mass hysteria.&quot;<br>Glade: &quot;You won't call the cops?&quot;<br>Kyth: &quot;Nope.

Here's your vanilla.&quot;<br><br><br><br>It's about two types of people, Gladetree. Most people eat the vanilla. They either don't know any better, or don't care. Either way, they get the flavor they deserve.<br><br>But one in a thousand, see, they leap over that counter, grab that scooper, and figure shit out for themselves. And the surest way to make them do that is to refuse to coddle them...refuse to spoonfeed them anything but vanilla. Eventually, one in a thousand gets fed up and jumps over that fucking counter, and that person is the real jewel of civilization. Not the sheep, never the sheep.<br><br>You're not advocate for free thought, Gladetree. You're just an advocate for being spoonfed a different flavor. <br><br>Spoonfeeding is spoonfeeding, regardless of the taste.

Ditto with your other comments dealing with &quot;evil&quot;. I think your definition of evil needs to be reworked since many a counter example can be found to demonstrate that the definition provided is not workable.<br><br><!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> &quot;-Osama Bin Laden shouldn't be our sole target...unless, of course, revenge is our only goal.&quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br><br>Osama is not the only target and yes, revenge is the goal, too. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br><!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> &quot;-The Taliban is no longer our enemy.&quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br><br>The Taliban never were the &quot;enemy&quot; they were in the way.

Yes, I want my facts, just like every other intelligent person on the planet, including you.  My desire for the facts to be reported to me through the media, however, seems to leave a sour taste in your mouth. Thus, I'll address this.<br><br>The reporting of the media is not necessarily the tell-all, end all source for information. On this I agree.  The problem is that the media holds great influence over the path of society's collective focus in the world.  I don't mean the &quot;masses&quot; even, but most individuals, even highly educated individuals, expect the greatest amount of factual information in their lives to come from the media.  This puts a responsibility on the media to provide facts, I argue.  <br><br>Regardless of my feelings, though, the media (in many forms) has, does and will continue to create a distinctly authorized view of the world, society, animals, religion, everything.  This is done, often unknowingly, by including and not including stories about certain topics. This, I agree, can be rectified through greater research. Unfortunately, this world-view is also created by deciding what does and does not get investigated, due in large part to assumed societal interest. Little interest, little money, no story.  Ideally, with no threat of bankruptcy over their head, reporters could investigate every story they wish to, as well as publish it all.  In reality, we both know this can't happen.  I just don't see the point in giving up on the ideal and saying it's our own laziness that we don't find out about these things that no one investigates.  <br><br>Of course, this also assumes reporters with a naturally inquisitive nature, as opposed to reporters trying simply to feed a family or, sometimes, make a lot of money.  It all comes down to journalistic integrity, and I think journalism has fallen short of this integrity of late, in large part due to economic factors tied to society's displeasure in reading/seeing things they'd rather not.<br><br>I hope even you realize the danger of simply allowing the discourse of journalism to sink into a mirror of the whims of the majority or government.  <br><br>glade <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ukytherion.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kytherion</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 358<br> <font color=#E9D756>(1/8/02 7:22:42 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=259.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> baaaaa</span><hr size=1> &quot;I hope even you realize the danger of simply allowing the discourse of journalism to sink into a mirror of the whims of the majority or government. &quot;<br><br><br>Not allowing the government to control the media has been a subtext of most of my posts to this thread. Let's use our own ideas for this, yes?<br><br>And so then we come to the crux of your problem. You distrust the majority. You don't feel the &quot;masses&quot; should control it.<br><br>And yet you feel the media should empower those very same masses by GIVING them the truth? If the majority are not to be trusted, why tell them the truth?<br><br>Apparently, you see no contradiction with this, but the contradiction is there. You don't want them to have the power, and yet you demand that they be given the power.<br><br><br><br>And if we do decide to give the truth, who decides what that truth will be? As Pilate said, what is truth?<br><br>Will YOU determine the truth for them? Who aspires to be the shepherd now?<br><br>Under our current system, people are free to pursue the truth, or free to pursue their own ignorance. You would exchange this for a guarantee of 'truth' for all...truth no doubt established by the shepherds you so distrust. There is perhaps no tyranny more insidious than a tyranny cloaked in the guise of benevolence.<br><br>Truly, the people would be indeed fortunate to have a shepherd such as you. Gone will be the days when one had to struggle for wisdom, they can simply help themselves to the pearls in your outstretched hand.<br><br>Don't look now, but you appear to be in the ice cream business. Are you a better man than I for refusing to serve vanilla when it is demanded?<br><br>Leave the masses their media, and all the vanilla they want. True subversion is an invaluable societal trait, but cannot be encouraged directly. Bullshit is the soil required for growing the delicate flower of subversion, and I have an interest in its continuance.<br><br>Your method kills it altogether. Your method sucks. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ugladetree.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gladetree</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 223<br> <font color=#E9D756>(1/8/02 9:34:37 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=259.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Contradiction?</span><hr size=1> Ok, let's use a bit of your logic and reach the conclusion i'm trying to explain:<br><br>The masses, the majority will control how the world is viewed, what is and is not acceptable, who is and is not acceptable as part of society, etc, all the way down the line...

If someone says &quot;this is a fact: A special forces soldier was killed today in Afghanistan&quot; I am rather inclined to believe them. Why?

The free and subversive can't be produced if they aren't oppressed or annoyed to some degree.<br><br>Ironically, the minority remains the minority only as long as it holds differing ideas. Those differing ideas come from the subversives...which are created by an oppressive standard to begin with.<br><br>You following this? Call it advanced applied sociology. If you protect them, they become tame, and thus useless.<br><br>The minority opposition MUST hold a degree of official disapproval...an edge of danger.
