Without having to explain my thoughts on time, I'll just gte to the conclusion and say, 'time' is a manmade concept and is a reflectance of birth and death.  This is the desire to recognize, understand and conceptualize the existence of 'systems' we come in contact with.  System, simply meaning process' that occur or exist.  Example a hurricane, birth, sex, erosion......shit like that.  SO, free will in regards to time doesn't exist in nature.  BUT, thats like saying, &quot;a bird lacks the brick to become a building&quot;.  Hehe, well I guess one day we might be able to create a bird that can morph into a building(but would he still be a 'bird'??), but I think you see where I'm coming from.  YES, I have free will to flog my nob at this moment in 'time'.  NO I do not have the free will to fly over a building, because I don't believe that I can.  DO I believe I can fly?  Well, yes I do.  When the time becomes necassary I will fly.<br>
  Free will is the freedom to make a choice.  This 'choice' in its naturalistic sense is dependent upon the 'natural' variable at hand.  But then again, I am not a naturalistic 'believer'.  I tend to see that most, if not all, philosophies have something important to offer.  But regarding my beliefs I do believe we have free will with regards to what we BELIEVE.  We CAN believe anything we so choose. We have that freedom.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ulurikeen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lurikeen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 65<br> <font color=#E9D756>(12/3/01 6:23:11 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=246.topic&index=44>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://server2048.virtualave.net/neplusultra/images/Links/Necromancer_Links/necrobackground.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Free Will Argument </span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> &quot;One of the boundaries of the 'free will' arguement is of time.

Hmmm... let me just say that given the current status of physics it is highly unlikely that you will ever naturally fly no matter how much you believe you can. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  The physical world limits what we can probably do under certain conditions.<br>
<br>
Concerning your assertions over &quot;time&quot; and &quot;free will&quot; I fail to see how you are connecting the two. Perhaps you could explain the relevance of time with free will?<br>
<br>
&quot;Free will is the freedom to make a choice&quot; and choice in its &quot;naturalistic sense is dependent upon the 'natural' variable at hand&quot; you say, but then you go on to say that is incorrect because we have &quot;free will with regards to what we BELIEVE&quot;. You then say we &quot;...CAN believe anything we so choose.&quot; I am not really following your line of reasoning. Why isn't choice dependant upon the &quot;natural variable at hand&quot; as you put it?<br>
<br>
Also, while we may be able to believe anything we so choose I fail to understand how that ties into the Free Will argument. Are you saying that because I can freely believe the statement &quot;X is a unicorn&quot; is true that I have free will? But I can't believe &quot;X is a unicorn&quot; is true unless I have good reason for such a belief. In other words, there are conditions that must first arise causing my belief. If we want to say that my belief that the statement is true has no prior conditions causing my belief then we are saying my belief is irrational. In other words we are saying I have no reasons to believe the statement to be true or false. This is the point I was making to Triff; it is not coherent to claim that I could have done otherwise (or chose otherwise). Certain conditions must be in place for us to choose X or Y. To say that I could have chosen otherwise is just to say that a different set of conditions were in place causing my choice. Choice is a very short leash. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>Lurikeen Mali'Kyre<BR>

   An example of having free will is our imagination.  You can say that you will fly, imagine it and while imagining it, you will have a feeling of it and will think about it.  So, (not saying this is flying) you have free will to feel, think and imagine whatever you choose.  <br>
   So, I do believe in both.  It's circumstancial.               Quote:  Lurikeen quoting me<br>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
   Ok this is where it gets really silly.  Physically, I do not have free will.  I can't choose to fly over a building.  (Note, The choice to fly over the building is an exemplification of free will but the result of me smashing my face in the ground while attempting to fly is a result of not having free will)    HOW can one move beyond the boundary of nature?  (This is a hypothesis)  By attaining a perfect balance of love and truth, we can move beyond the boundaries of natural law.  (Interesting that we are searching this topic and I stumbled upon  Poppen's story of his son's accident and God.)   He and his grandma and wife prayed for there son.  ('Prayed' meaning an attempt to tell God about how they feel and think)  Was it necassary that his son live.  Well no because nature doesn't give a shit how you feel or think.  BUT God does.  SO by expressing how strongly you feel about an event, searching deep within yourself you can find a reason for anything to be possible.  Poppen and the others expressed how they felt to God.  Feelings can make something necessary and therefore possible.  (Easy for me to say because no one has died early in life in my family) If someone did die in my family like Poppen's case I have no idea how I would react and hope that I never have this situation.  I have prayed that I die for my children as Jesus died for his.  I prayed that I die in the act of love and truth.  <br>
   Do I believe that this 'connection' if you can allow me to fly to class cause i fukin hate walking in the cold ass mornings?  No, I don't think so.  How can I honestly(truthfully) feel so passionately about such a matter? (i'm not going to make examples of this anymore cause I fear that I will mislead someone else if I do.)   <br>
   Its really late so I won't go into the time thing.  But will say that time is only a process or record of some event or process that has evolved in some way and that because we regard time and process so highly, it keeps us on the ground, so-to-speak.<br>

This is were the waters part bro.... My imagining flying doesn't mean that I actually am, and has no bearing upon free will. I think your statement about being bound by nature is a really nice one.

I love your way of explaining things<br>
------------------------------------------------------------<br>
  If so then I should be in prison due to all the women I screwed by mere thought! <br>
------------------------------------------------------------ Hehe, I would be in some deep shit as well.  I pasted this 'cause it points out the reason it will not happen.  'case no balance of truth and love can inflict such an action upon someone else.  It's actually pretty interesting to ponder the idea of this 'balance' and see what can be possible.  Now i don't mean balance to be a perfect 5 out of 10(no zero involved)  I mean balance which is a given, so-called, amount of love and truth in response to a certain situation or potential situation(like Triff's chilhood days of praying for snow, though it never came) &lt;--- Yes, I believe it is possible for Triff to pray for snow and it come true.  But, the neccesity of such would be only validated only by an enormous amount of 'love juice' (meaning a derivediv of love) combined with some other factor that God chooses(mabye it would be hurting someone to allow it to snow.  The 'prayer' would never know that nor would they be available to recognize such when involed with such an extreme amount of love)  So, Triff was kinda pissed off about it now snowing.  I believe that it is possible and understand some of the factors that are within MY control which are recognition and expression of love and truth.  BUT when affecting anothers life, someone has to make a decision I guess.  To be honest, I did pray for a white christmas one year.  It had been more than 50 years since the area had one.  But I told my cousin that we were going to have a white christmas anyway.  He looked at me like I was crazy.  Even a few days before christmas it was around 60 degrees.  I was starting to think that what I said wasn't important to God.  I admitted to God that it was selfish for me to wish such a thing but also gave him reasons that it would be good.  Anyway, some freak low pressure system formed off the coast, pulled moisture inland from the ocean and the coldest temperatures recorded in a long ass time or ever(cant remember exactly) came in at the same time and wammo, snowstorm dropped the most snow in a 'long ass time' also.  Anyway, I apologize if I have insulted anyone.  I know it is not as important as some of the family members mentioned in these posts, namely Lurikeen's.  Its just an example I guess of how sometimes its ok for silly, seemingly unnecessary things to happen.  Why is my oldest daughter autistic?  why can she not speak?  I wasn't pissed off at God but my wife sure was and prob still is.  Of course I understand why she is mad, and it does hurt to have a relationship with someone you love SOOOOO much but can't get them to talk back.  It hurts for my daughter to be in her own autistic world and us be out here wishing we could understand how we can help her.  Wishing that she never feel alone or not loved.  Wishing that people don't take advantage of her because of her disablility.  Praying to God that I am waiting for the time to be right where I can pray for her to be given speech.  Feeling embarassed in public when she moans instead of talking and shakes and waves around cause she needs her occupational therapist.  Meanwhile peps are looking at us like we have some inferior genetically fucked up animal as a child.  Wanting to smash their fuking face for being so damn ignorant.

I have a daughter, too. While I do not know your pain I can certainly understand it to some degree and feel what it might be like.<br>
<br>
What you courageously shared above is an excellent example as to why I would never attempt to "deconvert" a believer. There is truth and then there is love that MUST go with it. One without the other is inferior. I see that we agree on much Brutas. I will return to the topic of Free Will later. I just wanted to share and leave it here for the time being. :) <p>Lurikeen Mali'Kyre<BR>

<br>
I want to say that the definition of free will is not &quot;the ability to transcend the laws of physics&quot; and that that idea is completely irrelevent to this topic. Free will is the ability to control your body's movements according to what you want and choose, more or less.<br>
<br>
Lurikeen, to me you come off as thinking that we are all just impotent minds trapped inside senseless bodies with little control over what the body does or where it takes us. Maybe there's nothing wrong with that view for you. But I don't think you'll be able to find any proof behind that (do note that I have not seen you post any conclusive evidence to support your point, or at least I missed it if you did). <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ulurikeen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lurikeen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 76<br> <font color=#E9D756>(12/5/01 11:19:30 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=246.topic&index=50>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://64.81.30.48/EQstuff/necrobackground.bmp WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Free Will Argument </span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> &quot;Lurikeen, to me you come off as thinking that we are all just impotent minds trapped inside senseless bodies with little control over what the body does or where it takes us.

<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Well, I certainly don't think we are &quot;impotent minds trapped inside senseless bodies&quot; and I really don't know what I wrote that gave you such an indication. Truth is, I don't think in terms of a duality of mind and body. Again, as I have stated before, I am more inclined towards a view of Physicalism which reduces &quot;mind&quot; to electro/physiological components of the body. I see people as an organic whole. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Now, I think you are confusing my view of Determinism with Predeterminism as evidenced by your remark above. I never at any time stated nobody has choice. I have clearly indicated that choice is caused. When I lift my index finger to press the keys on my keyboard it is because certain conditions in my body have first been met (such as my brain sending specific electro-chemical signals to my central nervous systems in response to what I see as I read your post).<br>
<br>
I have also stated my view is very complicated and would require very lengthy posts to offer a satisfactory explanation of it. Since this is a *game* board I have limited the length of my posts considerably.<br>
<br>
Concerning your charge that I have offered no &quot;proof&quot; I certainly have not. Neither have I intended to offer formal arguments to support my opinions, since this is a game board. I may be under the mistaken impression that we are all tossing around our opinions and simply shooting the shit as if we were in a bar drinking beer together. If I am mistaken be sure to let me know, and if I am I would like to see formal arguments from you proving your opinions. I have as yet to see them. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Finally, you doubt I would be able to find &quot;proof&quot; to support my views. Let me recommend a couple books to you:<br>
<br>
&quot;Reason, Truth, and History&quot; by Hilary Putnam<br>
&quot;Inquiries into Truth &amp; Interpretation&quot; by Donald Davidson<br>
<br>
You will find many formal arguments and evidence galore supporting my views. If you purchase the books we can go through them chapter by chapter?<br>

I think that Putnam chick(99% sure) is one of the guest speakers at my school a few weeks ago who got blasted for her remarks about the war.  I'm curious if you know more about it.]   OH also wanted to tell ya that I have been having prob getting online but when i do I have enough buyers to get the CoCW for fungi and 70k.  If your still interested that is.   And about 'proof'; that is a sensory response to a memory.  plz don't let me go into memory.  So, once again because everything is relative, 'everything' can't be proven to exist.  Heh, kind of freaky but when looking at things objectively its a true statement.  People that don't agree are basing their support on empirical data and forgetting about the 'psychological realm'.

So even "nothing" is pre-Ordered, there may eventually even be a life "after death" (another contradiction) but time will not alter reality.<br>

<br>
OK, I'm game... what are you trying to say here, Misty? Especially the bit &quot;Everything relative is systematic&quot;. What does that mean? Are you pointing at relative motion between accelerated systems (Second Part of General Relativity)?<br>
<br>
The statement &quot;the blink of time cannot be a collision of all that is and all that shall be for time could not collide all itself...&quot; is poetic, but I fail to see your point. What is it? Unless the following is supposed to clarify...<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> &quot;Put it this way, an &quot;X&quot; by itself cannot meet its own face, occupying its space and time; however beginning &quot;X&quot; and ending &quot;X&quot; are able to meet as the interval of the same thing &quot;X&quot; not &quot;X&quot; relative to each other, for they have direction which makes for a seperable difference and yet have a displacement of nil.&quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Unfortunately, the above raises even more questions as to what you are saying. I would say that &quot;time&quot; and &quot;motion&quot; are not things in themselves but are real only in relation to consciousness. So, talk of &quot;X&quot; as having spatial/temporal properties puzzles me with regard to your assertions over time. I think if you could clarify your points it would be very interesting.

Noteworthy is liberty to do a thing, another is the bonds of physical nature within an external reality. Ultimately external reality determines nature's choices, indeed to reach escape velocity and orbit earth in freefall affordably by choice might not appeal to you. If our nature was capable of sprouting wings you would soar over that building but what our external nature IS and the liberty to be something we ought be able to become reduces individual free will to a conflict with common freedom.<br>
<br>
We have Free Will, though we dream it should be more, or altogether mistake our common freedom yet retain inner-space for the individual liberty to take licence with reality.<br>

But the funny thing about science and logic is that it is all based on facts which are 'known'.  Its limitation is within its design.  When I read your text, I see a mind which is limited to something that is 'known' to have been proven.  Do you find it strange that your logic is based on other's conclusions?  There is an advantage to your philosophy and that is its ability to draw conclusions quickly.  I'm sure thats satisfying for you.  But, we are talking about something not proven by science and what value 'it' might have.  Personally I htink both veiws have their advantage.  Yours I have have already exclaimed, and mine being discovery.  Both are equally important.  Without discovery there would be no science, logic, rational, practicality or empirical thought.  But like I said, both are equally important.  If I were in a position to select a person to explain the 'workings' of a computer I would select you above myself.  But if I had to select someone to 'come up' with an idea for something that would contain and process complex values with the push of a button it would not be you.  Its kind of like choosing between Isaac Asimov and the most brilliant, unimaginative engineer who ever lived. I would pick Asimov to give me an idea about future travel in space versus Neil Armstrong, who I'm sure knows alot more about rockets, space shuttles and what propels them than Asimov(I know Asimov is dead, he's just an example)  Anyway,  everyone is special, but certain ocassions call for certain tools.  Of course that is easier said than done with the ass-fucked world we live in. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showMessageRange?topicID=246.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showMessageRange?topicID=246.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a> <b>3</b> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showMessageRange?topicID=246.topic&start=61&stop=80>4</a><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showMessageRange?topicID=246.topic&start=81&stop=96>5</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showMessage?topicID=270.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showMessage?topicID=261.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=246.topic&index=60><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/gfx/addReply1.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.emailToFriend?topicID=246.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.threadControl?topicID=246.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/deleteThreadFire.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=246.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=246.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub4.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="emarrmessageboardrules">Message Board Rules<option value="emarrlinks">Links<option value="emarrupcomingmmorpgs">Upcoming MMOG's<option value="emarrfrm16">The Emarr Quadrant<option value="emarrfrm18">America Under Attack<option value="emarrfrm19">Dark Age of Camelot<option value="emarrgeneral">General<option value="emarrfrm17">Funny Stuff<option value="emarrbazaar">Item Bazaar<option value="emarrscrollsnspells">Spell Bazaar<option value="emarrfrm15">Shiny Things<option value="emarrfrm14">Bargain Basement<option value="emarrdragonsandplanes">Rants and Flames<option value="emarrfrm13">Dragons and Planes<option value="emarrroleplaying">Roleplaying<option value="emarrroleplayingoocforum">Roleplaying - OOC Forum<option value="emarrscammeralert">Scammer Alert<option value="emarrsignaturecorner">Test Forum<option value="emarrreallife">Real Life<option value="emarrothermmorpgs">Other MMOG's</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#E9D756>- </font><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/bemarr>Erollisi Marr, The Queen of Love</a><font color=#E9D756> - </font><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18>America Under Attack</a> <font color=#E9D756> - </font><br><br> <br>
