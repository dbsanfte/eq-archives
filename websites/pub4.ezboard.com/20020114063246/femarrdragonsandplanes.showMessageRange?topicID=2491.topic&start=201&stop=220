.... should I even bother commenting on this? How long have you been playing EQ Chiteng, 2.5 years? And you don't know that planar armor is no drop? Just how ignorant can you be. Why should anyone believe anything you say about EQ when you are trying to argue that Remdar should have given a BP to Justicia that he couldn't possibly have done. Again you are proving my point: You make up your own illusions about events to find hatred in them because that is all you are filled of.<br>

<p>Chiteng your ability to beat a fossilized horse is astounding.  Now right on to business.  Using only some simple logic one can establish that yes, you are indeed a "<bold>fuck</bold><font color="green">tard</font><br>

<br><br>
A while back you posted this:<br><br><br>
<br>
<font face="arial", color="red", size=2><br>
<br>
It is like this:<br>
<br>
Have any of you EVER heard me flame Ogmuk or Naru?<br>
No you have not.<br>
Do you think that is because I agree with him/them?<br>
Dont hold your breath.<br>
<br>
I dont flame him because he hasnt offended my sensibilities. Yes he has defended his guild when he felt<br>
I attacked it. It is possible I would do the same.<br>
<br>
The one thing I am absolutely<br>
certain of is that Ogmuk hates cheaters and exploiters<br>
as much as I do. (or at least he did)<br>
<br>
Ogmuk has a trait that I very much wish I had.<br>
He has the ability to bend.<br>
He has the ability to NOT become absolute.<br>
These are enviable abilities both in game and in reality.<br>
<br>

And then you posted this:<br>
<br><br>
<font face="arial", color="red", size=2><br>
Ogmuk, your a complete horses ass. <br>

<br><br>
Lets just think about that for a few moments.  Now on to the next one.<br>
<br><br>
<font face="arial", color="red", size=2><br>
How exactly would I know who was the guild leader? To me there is only one<br>
TRUE leader of DK. Yes I suppose that qualifies as a delusion. I dont care,<br>

This actually had me rolling on the floor laughing, really.  After playing this game for 2 and a half years, you still don't know ANYTHING. Hell you could ask any newbie in the commons about planar armor and he could even tell you it is no drop. Well, after establishing what a fucktard you really are, lets get down to it.</p><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<p><br>
It is quite obvious, you don't know anything about Da`kor.  You don't know even know who the guildmaster was.  Maybe you shouldn't spend so much time posting on a message board about a guild that quit MONTHS ago,and work on pulling your head out of your ass</p></br><br>

<br>
Well, see now, we have more details.  I've lived with someone for five years, I go downstairs and find 5 human bodies without a mark on them.  Are they dead? You don't say.  They could be five sleeping human bodies.  Frankly, I stumble over 5 sleeping human bodies on a regular basis in my house, we have lots of friends, they crash.  Kids stay over etc.  <br>
<br>
So now I'm lookin at five bodies, unmarked.  You must be a panicky sort, because I wouldn't AUTOMATICALLY assume they were dead.  I might check for a heartbeat.  Of course, I've had guys do amazingly convincing feign deaths after parties before, so they might fool me, but lets go on.  So now I've confirmed that there are five bodies, all dead, with nothing to indicate how they died.  (with any luck the hubby is among them and I'm gonna collect big, but I digress).  I might yell up the stairs &quot;Hey, did you know there were five dead bodies in the basement?&quot; With any luck, I'm not gonna be the sixth, but then curiousity always did get the better of me.  <br>
<br>
If I'm alone, I think I'd dial 911, after assuring myself I hadn't gone into some sort of fugue state and killed them myself.  It's possible you know.  I could have another personality I know nothing about.  She could be a black widow, and these bodies could be my dead husbands.  But anyway, after I determined that I was most likely NOT the one responsible for their deaths, I'd call the cops.  I certainly wouldn't go screaming out into the street like a lunatic.  I'm a tough bitch tho, and I've seen my fair share of dead bodies.  It isn't all that exciting. <br>
<br>
Besides, if my &quot;live-in&quot; or whatever you wanna call it killed 5 folks, the chances that I'd have to worry about my faith in them or even live with them any longer would be pretty nil.<br>

I dare you, Chiteng to pick up the phone, call the police and report that you witnessed the crime of some pixel nuking some other pixel thru the wall, all against the rules of a game.  If they are still on the phone when they are done laughing at you and haven't come to haul you away, I give you permission to tell them that once, I hacked my Heroes of Might &amp; Magic character and gave him a godly army.  I then proceeded to wipe out the game entirely, totally against the way NWC meant me to play it.  I'm packin my shit for jail now.  Let me know when they are on the way to arrest me.  It should fit in your timeframe, as it was roughly 2-3 years ago.<br>
<br>
For the record, I regularly poison ants, swat flies, kill mice and other assorted wild animals, as I live in a heavily wooded area.  Not only I do it.  THE FREAKIN NEIGHBORS do too.  But we are a neighborhood of wanna-be serial killers, if I follow your logic.  <br>
<br>
One last thing, you can search on Caoilfhionn.  It's a real name.  You're gonna get LOTS of returns.  I'm not the writer named Caoilfhionn, and I don't live in Ireland or Scotland.  As far as I know, I'm not Kerrol or Nuldar, but like I said, I might have a multiple personality I'm not aware of.  <br>
<br>
To reiterate: Nothing you say can convince me that some guy, who gets up, feeds his dog, goes to work and comes home to play an online game that at ONE point he may have done something shady in = Ted Bundy.  Oh, Ted killed a LOT of women.  He might be too evil for your comparison.  If you need any other serial killer information, or info on dead bodies or why men (mostly men) kill in such a manner, be sure to let me know.  I know more about that stuff than you could ever possibly dream of, but then that's what I study.  <br>

The above is a direct copy from the Google search engine. Ok so to my reading it implied Kerrol was Nuldar. On a second reading I can see it is simply bad punctuation. Let me see Typing 'nuldar' into google is now eqated with Cyberstalking. Amazing. If you believe that I suggest you report it to EZ-board.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
So to summarize: <br>
None of you addressed the two issues raised<br>
You state I should not be listened to because I dont read other peoples posts carefully.<br>
What did I miss?<br>
Oh and it doesnt matter anyway because it is all old news.<br>
<br>
Well since none of the respondants except Kanya and Zolen are from the 'Old' DK<br>
and you were all dismissed. Well somehow it seems to me that it lacks merit.<br>
Zolen - Ok You win.<br>
Kanya - Not willing to play your game any longer. You want to make me seem inconsistant - fine. Im inconsistant. I dont attack innocent people.<br>
You compare a time when I knew the DK members all knew the truth and were<br>
impling I was a liar by being silent (that would include you and Rannd btw - But <br>
that should be obvious) To a time now when they dont know anything really except what they read here. Yes I changed my stance.  How could anyone with a conscience NOT change their stance.<br>
Also I did post that I dont really have the time do post at all.<br>
Only one day left.<br>

I said 5 LIVE flies with wings picked off. That would indicate(to me) a disturbed mind.<br>
I didnt say: 5 dead flies. That would indicate someone good with a flyswatter.<br>

My point was that ANY behavior that is intended to delibretely harm is BAD.<br>
My wife would agree with you about the life insurance.<br>

I do NOT make such sophistry distinctions in game or out. Would I call the cops<br>
for 5 flies w/o wings? no. Would I talk to the wife YES.<br>

  Vendrix has been Da`Kor since the day of its creation on E-Marr with Onyyn only a few weeks behind that.<br>

I just sat and read (almost) the entire thing.<br>

Kerrol, Vendrix and Ice Weasel had me in stitches.<br>

I must admit though I started skimming most of Chiteng's posts, they were a bit redundant and predictable.  The true dessert/reward was in the replies.  Simply golden.<br>
<br>
Carry on,<br>

PS - I really could care less who is right or wrong, for most of the events I was way behind in levels and have never really interacted with any Da`kor be they "old" school or "new".  But, Chiteng's arguments, even from my outsider perspective, are impressive in their own special way.<br>

At least he recalls the last point he tried to make when you respond to him, unlike you.<br>
<br>
In this verbal game of tennis you and I have played throughout this thread, you’ve hit numerous serves over the net – all of which I have returned in a swift and detailed fashion, giving all the information to defend and/or describe our actions in a given situation. Unlike a conventional tennis match, you chose not to hit that same ball back to me, but, rather, lob a bowling ball back at me and claim victory.<br>
<br>
You keep harping on the Justicia/Da`Kor events like they are a major backbone of your case against us, yet you’ve got not a single fact correct. You are spouting off nth degree hearsay and asking us to explain our actions for something that’s pretty cut and dry.<br>
<br>
1. It happened so long ago, it was when Cleric armor still dropped in the Plane of FEAR, not the Plane of Hate because that zone didn’t exist yet. You got that part wrong. I think Justicia quit the game/took a long vacation before the Plane of Hate even opened.<br>
2. Name me a single piece of armor from the common mobs, in either plane, that isn't no drop, this doesn’t require any specific knowledge of Cleric equipment. Everything is no drop, Shiverback, Ethereal Mist, Gay Wizard armor, etc.<br>
3. She camped, Remdar looted and that’s that. Give people some credit, do you really think this would even be an issue if the piece wasn’t no drop? It would have been resolved as soon as everyone logged back in.<br>
<br>
You make us out to be the ultimate evil on EMarr, that’s hardly the case. As I stated before, we’ve never been accused of hacking, scamming, speed-looting or anything else that actually matters to more people than just you. We’ve even gone through phases of helping the general population of Emarr, and they didn’t want to help themselves.<br>
<br>
Sudo once volunteered to lead a group of random people on a raid against Lord Nagafen. No payment, I'm not even sure he wanted any loot. He offered to show them where we pull, what resists to have, what spells to cast, etc. Do you know how far he got, King Tranix. Want to know why, because someone felt the need to speedloot Tranix as soon as he hit the ground… and just like that, the raid ended. Why should he trust them to be fair to each other with dragon loot when they speedloot something as small as a mithril torque?<br>
<br>
I once sat in Permafrost answering questions posed by Mitch at, I believe, her first Vox raid ever. I came to see what the progress was, to determine if I should call my guild to the zone. I got there, by my observation they had enough people to do the job so I told my guys to go do exp or something. I sat there and answered questions for three hours, not just from Mitch but from everyone there. They told me their resists, what they planned on wielding, what spells they thought they should cast and I gave them advice as if this was my raid and I wanted to see a dead dragon. I know they didn’t defeat Lady Vox that day(they even got trained by a Guide, dunno if they knew that), but I know they learned a hell of a lot… most importantly, get a map. <p><b>Vendrix</b><br>
