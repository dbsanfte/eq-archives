For places like Hate and Sky, with high costs over the normal cleric and enchanter expences I will reserve a few rare gems (usually 2 diamonds or jacinths) for recompensation of the clerics and others who have spent money on make the raid a sucess.  I feel it is wrong for the clerics to end up with cash out of pocket.  Should we get enough cash loot durring the raid to pay back all of our expences then the rare gems I reserved are randomed to the raid.  And yes , I have run raids in which not enough cash loot has droped, and I have given out a diamond or 2 jacinths to a cleric for sale.<br>
  I also feel that if someone wishes to claim an item as a raid goal and states that as such before the raid, it is fair.  I also agree with sagemon and siilverain's points as well.<br>
  I like your theory of keeping the rare gems for those not winning armor drops, that seems very fair, but implementation would he a huge problem.  Some people have to leave the raid early, and you couldnt distrubute the rare gems till after the raids ends, otherwise how do you know who gets the gems.  Then you have to track down everyone who won a rare gem, that could takes weeks in real life.<br>
  This is just my opionon, I wish you all the best of luck on your raids. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>Jalec Greyheart level 56 Paladin and

Second, it has been my experience that only guilty people start defending themselves so adamently that their true colors &amp; vocabulary show.  I am not saying you are guilty of anything that Sagemon has said ( I wasn't there and frankly don't care ). However I would recommend that you take a more calm approach to these accusations instead of making yourself look like a jackass.  Or just ignore them completely and go about your day. Either way, your responding isn't helping your case much. <p>Ever in service of Clan Battle Axe,<BR>

<br>
How on earth is it even possible for Sagemon to hurt your rep more than you've done so already?  Sage has a rather upstanding reputation and I don't see where your pathetic attempts to flame him or defame his name is really going to do much damage.  People always consider the source.<br>
<br>
I have a great idea for you though Valric, that would work VERY well with your BD for the raid leader, main assist, puller and main randomer concept.   Go get Airaman for your main puller (she did such a stellar job in Fear), get Scootie for your main assist, take Mumaden as your main randomer and you get to be the raid leader.  I would say that's the perfect set up for a bunch of greedy loot whores who have ZERO in the positive reputation side.  Pretty much right up your alley from what I've seen here of your babbling too.  <br>

Awwww, poor little innocent Valric.  You can't bring yourself to admit that anything that is said about you is correct, can you?  For some reason, you just won't ever admit your wrong and take the blame.  That is about the only thing that could possibly save you at this point -- for you to have the balls to own up to your mistakes, but then again, you probably traded your balls for a blue diamond somewhere along the line. <p>Tormentcia

You have the same attitude that Valric shares, I'm surprised you're not best buds with him.<br>
<br>
As for Sage and I not being shining members of society according to you, hmm, shows how much you know.  Our reputations are boy pretty decent and our raids are set up through e-mail.  Why?  Because we got sick of people like you jumping our raids an hour or so before ours was planned so we took it off the board.  Your precious raid planned after ours and we simply gave you the courtesy of letting you know so you didn't waste your time.  However, what did you do?  You planned yours for the night before, knowing the spawn rate on Growth is about 24 hours, so we wouldn't have any pops.  Classy move.  You should be so proud.  Fortunately, I didn't deal with you on this one .. we dealt with Quis who was more than fair so that both raiding parties could attend.  It's a good thing he doesn't speak for you.<br>
<br>
On top of that, guilds don't post their plans here, they do it privately and you don't seem to have a problem with that .. only with us.<br>
<br>
It must be jealousy.  Yep, that's what I'm thinking. <p>Tormentcia

Of course, you and Valric are the only members.<br>
<br>
And considering the amount of bitching that you have done when your raids have to be canceled because someone else is in the zone ahead of you, you shouldn't be throwing stones.  Yes, we've heard you whining to your pals like a little girl.<br>
<br>
I'd make a few more comments, but the truth is that I've been trying to be nicer to you in the last few days.  You may not be the brightest bulb on the porch, but you're not an outright turd like Valric.  No one has ever called you a scammer or a cheater or a thief, nor has anyone accused you of outright harassment, KSing, or training.  Your intentions are good, and you deserve more respect than pond scum like Valric. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uriptsouthpaw.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ript Southpaw</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 206<br> <font color=#E9D756>(8/10/01 6:58:55 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://members.theglobe.com/MasterSp/RAWR.JPG height=150 width=150></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The fairest way in PoG?</span><hr size=1> Honestly I doubt he was truly giving Valric real praise, more just a prop to use to flame you in some odd way sage.

<br>
Would the raid leader, MA and puller like to go to POG without clerics? Enchanters? Tanks? Buffers? Blasters? Snarers? If you think you are that much more valuable as to deserve special monetary compensation, go to POG by yourself.<br>
<br>
I also noticed that your special &quot;plan&quot; of loot distribution didn't take dots/pearls/coffins into consideration.  Nice. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/utormentcia.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tormentcia</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 131<br> <font color=#E9D756>(8/10/01 9:48:39 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The fairest way in PoG?</span><hr size=1> You make an excellent point Gloriana.  The MA, the ML, the leader, the puller don't raid on their own, they have a lot of support behind them and without that support, they'll be on CR all damn night.  What makes them any more special?  Nothing really.  Who chooses who gets the MA position or the ML postion, etc?  The raid leader.  Why not make it fair among the whole group to get a shot at doing those things and getting your wonderful payment system?  Because that wouldn't work in your little scheme Valric.  <br>
<br>
The point still is, and I'm glad you brought it up Gloriana, is that those guys don't go up alone and to compensate them for doing their jobs while the others don't get jack squat, is pretty wrong and very cheesy.   <p>Tormentcia
