They don't? You actually took a survey of everyone who posts on this board and they dont think that of you? Or is it just the fact that you're so delusional that you think you can speak for every single person who posts here? I am betting on the latter answer. <br>
<br>
Mitch here is a clue for you, and I have given you so many of these I think I may have to start charging now, just because <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> YOU</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> say <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> YOU</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> are intelligent doesn't really mean you are. Of course in that little fantasy world you have created for yourself you can be anything you want to be, yes even intelligent if you try hard enough.<br>
<br>
Maybe one day you will learn how to use the caps lock or shift key Mitch, who knows, someday you may /shrug<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Ahh but you're very response here and on countless other threads exposes the lie in that statement doesnt it dork. You see, using logic, if you could not be bothered then, ergo, you would not in fact 'bother' to post. The real reason is that once you strip any of your posts of invective and swearing and character slurs there is actually no substance whatsoever left in them. In essence you have nothign to say, and yet due to obsessive traits which you proudly display, you are unable to do otherwise.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Ahh but if I have nothing to say then why do you always reply to my posts then? Surely if all I posted was &quot;nothing&quot; then you would not in fact 'bother' to post. I have plenty to say Mitch and each one of my words just leaves another scar on that fat arse of yours.<br>
<br>
Lets look at this obsession thing you keep going on about;<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Times Mitch Has posted On Dwarkarn's Guild Message Board=1<br>
Times Dwarkarn has posted on Mitch's Guild Message Board=0</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Hmm now looking at that I would say that the obsessed person would be the one that bothered to go over to my guilds message board and post up a lame troll post there. I bet you visited that board everyday and eventually the pressure just became too much, you sat there chanting to yourself &quot;Must Post, Must Post, Must make Dwarkarn notice me, I want attention!&quot; You probably even fondled your miniscule pebble like balls as you chanted.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Unlike you I have on many occaisions admitted when i have been in error, there is no shame in being fallible, also unlike you however i only post vigourously on things i believe. You post merely to troll and to shout and swear as some kind of (I can only deduce) emotional crutch to your ego which seems to be suffering from a personal worth crisis and which can only be assuged by tryign to shout down anyone who disagrees with your juvenile attempts at bullying.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Mitch you <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> NEVER</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> admit you are wrong, take your meds calm down and I am sure you might slip out of delusion and into real life for a moment. I understand the real world is a horrible place for you, too many mirrors around to see your horrid reflection in, realising your only friend is a cockroach that you caught in the kitchen and then the double blow to your allready crushed self esteem is when you realise that the cockroach is more intelligent and actually looks better then you, ok you may take your Delusion pill again and slip back off into that land where everybody loves you.<br>
<br>
I do post mainly to troll and flex my excellent swearing skills, however how would posting on a message board inflate my ego? I truly pity you if you are that much of a walking sphincter that you take message boards as seriously as you appear to. Let's look at this personal worth crisis issue, surely if I had a low self esteem I wouldn't have posted my picture up on the Emarr photos thread, I haven't seen your picture there Mitch, care to show us all what you look like? After you have posted your pic then and only then can we discuss the personal worth and self esteem issues again.<br>
<br>
Attempts at bullying? How the fuck can you bully someone on a message board? Obviously you are having flashbacks about what happens to you in the schoolyard playground everyday, you know where all the kids start chanting &quot;Mitch , Mitch here comes the fat arse bitch, Mitch.&quot; You really do take this seriously don't you Mitch, if you think someone's words on a message board have the power to bully someone around then you are the biggest cum swallower that I have ever had the displeasure of knowing.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> That is exactly the type of comment i refer to above, supposedly insulting yet empty of meaning and immature, more worthy of the schoolyard than anywhere else. tell me do you think that kind of statement is cool? does you laugh to yourself as you write it thinking ''this will annoy Mitch'' ?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
You should be the last person talking about immaturity Mitch, let's site the famous bracer example shall we? You see kiddies when Mitch gets into a tizzy with someone she likes to take it out on them by destroying some of their equipment, I think you better go look up maturity in the dictionary there Mitch, don't be too disappointed when you don't see your picture next to the definition.<br>
<br>
Did I laugh to myself as I wrote that statement? Yes<br>
Did I laugh even harder as I thought &quot;This will annoy Mitch&quot;? Hell fuck yes and guess what it did.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Again we see the needless (and pointless) use of swearing merely to show that ''hey i am a big man!, i CAN swear'', it serves no purpose but to belittle you and anythign you are attempting to convey<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
By your logic then, everyone who swears is an idiot with an ego problem, I think many people would disagree. I think I am conveying my message very well, after all you keep posting to have another crack at me, so I must be getting under your skin.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> So this is from personal observation dorkan? ie you folow me around in real life and observe my movements? of course if it was, then this could be a factual statment, but as it is its merely more made-up childish (and i emphasise the childish) remarks comign from a wild and off balance imagination. Tell me dorkan, are the days lonely? the nights cold??<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
No I didn't follow you around, I read an article about you in &quot;Lonely Fat Man-Whore Monthly Magazine&quot; Remember that article where they did a short life story on you, I almost shed a tear when they got to the part where you explained what your daddy used to do to you with a cattle prod and electric can opener.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Is ''whipping my arse'' another of your fevered imaginative ravings dork? i can assure you that as much as you seem fixated on my 'ass', you'll have to settle for the ones inside your magazines until you learn some social skills.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I don't have to imagine Mitch, my words whip your arse all over this message board with every post. As for the magazines , sorry to shatter your fantasy but I don't need them, I do plenty well with the ladies in real life, thanks for being concerned though.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Please explain to me the 'super hero' reference, your rantings are becoming pretty whacky again (btw the correct gender is Heroine btw, just fyi).<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
It came from another post, in another thread, you posted after it and said you didn't bother reading it, I am sure other people read it though so they will understand the reference.<br>
<br>
The correct Gender is not Heroine at all, remember you are a man whore, .......oh sorry just realised you took another delusion pill and you are back in your happy world again, so maybe, just possibly you may be a heroine in your own imagination.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Again here we see the angry young man with nothign to say, spewign forth invective after invective to parade a wishful scenario that his pained soul would wish to come to pass, that he craves, but deep down he knows that he has no power over anyone, least of all myself and this only adds to his anger, which makes him spew forth more angst. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Wow lots of spelling mistakes there you must of sure been angry. As for the rest of that junk stop trying to play Sigmund Freud you aren't very good at it.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> This would be a reference to you threatening to hack people yes? an accusation you denied strongly, saying there had never been such a post, and you had not deleted it.....and then your board admin came and posted that yes, actually that post did exist, and that he/she deleted it....oops<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I never denied the thread existed Mitch, you just keep telling yourself that for some stupid reason. What I denied was the fact I mispelled my own name in that thread. You should bring that old signature back, you know the one where you mispelled my name, I still haven't got over laughing at that one, you really should reside in a hardware store you are such a tool. <br>
<br>
Yes the board admin proved to you that I never deleted it, but still you keep going on about it because it's the only thing you have left to cling to, poor Mitch. You should just admit you fucked up and spelled my name wrong in your sig, since you are so good at admitting when you are wrong. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Be assured I will post when and where i see fit, i always have and i always will, nothing you say or does affects me so much as makes me wonder what life, your family and your environment did to you to make you sush an angry, sad and small minded person, with genuine episodes of imaginative psychosis.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Once again lets look at the above quote and others you have made before, you say my posts have no substance and are nonsense, yet you can't help replying can you? You crave any type of attention that you can get, so sad that a message board is the only place you can get it. <br>
<br>
My upbringing and family life was fine Mitch, thanks for being concerned though. I really hope you were looking into a mirror while when you said psychosis.<br>
<br>
Mitch_the_pot say hello to Mr_black the kettle.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> All I can say is please seek help before its too late<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
They are words only YOU can live by, Mitch first you are going to have to admit to yourself that you need help, however in your current state of denial I cannot see that happening.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> ps please dont try and dissect this post because...well, spade hole...hole..spade..get it?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Aww finally she says 'please' and begs for mercy. &quot;Please Mr Dwarkarn don't pick my posts apart, you make me look so stupid and I don't think my shattered self esteem can withstand another battering&quot;<br>
<br>
For once I agree with you Mitch, you are right I am digging a hole, and I am about to chuck you and your coffin right into it.<br>

‘’just because YOU say YOU are intelligent doesn't really mean you are. Of course in that little fantasy world you have created for yourself you can be anything you want to be, yes even intelligent if you try hard enough.’’<br>
<br>
You are totally correct dork, people can say what they like on a message board however there comes a point when you’ve watched and known someone for a couple of years that you can judge/assess their intelligence to a point, and in that context (context means ‘situation relating to’, in dummy terms, just fyi) you have shown and boasted and SHOUTED to the whole community what a low grade, narrow minded below par intellect you possess.  Or did you perhaps think that this:<br>
<br>
Motherfucking fuck whore faggot etc etc etc etc etc<br>
<br>
Paints you as one of the new age Thinkers ?<br>
<br>
Hardly, it displays you as you really are, trash.  Its not as if you use the occaisonal swearword to stress your point, which is commonly used and can work well, its more a case of people having to filter out the shit in your posts to try and find some meaning.<br>
<br>
<br>
‘’Maybe one day you will learn how to use the caps lock or shift key Mitch, who knows, someday you may /shrug’’<br>
<br>
<br>
And here we see the internets lamest flame, perhaps if I cared more about the spelling and punctuation I’d actually check it, but to me the ‘’content’’ carries more weight.  A lesson so obviously wasted on you<br>
<br>
‘’Ahh but if I have nothing to say then why do you always reply to my posts then?’’<br>
<br>
Because offensive little immature trolls like you need to be slapped down, and regularly.<br>
‘’Surely if all I posted was "nothing" then you would not in fact 'bother' to post’’<br>
<br>
I was not the one saying I was not bothered dorkan, please refer to your earlier statement and my response, are you really so inane that you have to reuse my own words to flailingly attempt to gain credibility? /laugh<br>
<br>
‘’I have plenty to say Mitch and each one of my words just leaves another scar on that fat arse of yours.’’<br>
<br>
Please feel free to post a picture of my ‘fat arse’  unless of course this is just more made up fantasising from that damaged imagination of yours, you certainly do seem fixated on my ass though, which is kind of worrying.  I mean you spend SO MUCH time going on about how I am a MAN and SO MUCH time about how my ass is this, and my ass is that……so you say I’m a man but are fascinated by my ass?<br>
<br>
Interesting.<br>
<br>
‘’Lets look at this obsession thing you keep going on about;<br>
<br>
Times Mitch Has posted On Dwarkarn's Guild Message Board=1<br>
Times Dwarkarn has posted on Mitch's Guild Message Board=0’’<br>
<br>
Ahhh I see, also the fact that oranges are ‘orange’ and apples green or  ‘red’ backs this up, I mean the relevance is quite clear…<br>
<br>
/rolls_eyes<br>
<br>
Struggling or what?  Poor guy<br>
<br>
‘’Hmm now looking at that I would say that the obsessed person would be the one that bothered to go over to my guilds message board and post up a lame troll post there.’’<br>
<br>
I don’t like bullies and I don’t like people making threats, you did both by posting that you would have someone hacked if they did not stop showing what a lying little tool you were on your own board.<br>
<br>
‘’I bet you visited that board everyday and eventually the pressure just became too much, you sat there chanting to yourself "Must Post, Must Post, Must make Dwarkarn notice me, I want attention!" You probably even fondled your miniscule pebble like balls as you chanted.’’<br>
<br>
Here again class we see the imagination at work, do you actually think about anyone else but me?<br>
<br>
‘’Mitch you NEVER admit you are wrong, take your meds calm down and I am sure you might slip out of delusion and into real life for a moment. I understand the real world is a horrible place for you, too many mirrors around to see your horrid reflection in, realising your only friend is a cockroach that you caught in the kitchen and then the double blow to your allready crushed self esteem is when you realise that the cockroach is more intelligent and actually looks better then you, ok you may take your Delusion pill again and slip back off into that land where everybody loves you.’’<br>
<br>
Oh dear, /error_sound<br>
<br>
Again, because I know you have a problem with knowledge retention, I’ve admitted fault on here when fault has been mine, I’m usually quick to do it as well, various people can back that up.  You state something in big bold letters attempting to ‘make it true’, merely because its BIG but sadly you are as wrong on this as everything else.  As I know you are very slow I will give you two examples of admitting I was wrong which the readers of this board will know.<br>
<br>
1.   Accidentally training a Fire Giant raid some months ago and killing everyone<br>
<br>
Not only did I wait for a GM to arrive, I also asked for a penalty, with witnesses.  The GM refused after looking at the facts.  I then came to the boards and apologised.  I made no shoddy excuses, none were needed.<br>
<br>
2.   I posted a general comment about Affliction which was uncalled for recently, a couple of Affliction people asked me to re-assess what I’d written, I did, and found that it was unfair and wrong.  I apologised on the same thread, that thread is certainly on here somewhere.<br>
<br>
That’s just two, there have of course been more, which makes this:<br>
<br>
‘’ ’Mitch you NEVER admit you are wrong….’’  <br>
<br>
And everything else in that pus infested paragraph a totally incorrect piece of bullshit doesn’t it dork, feeling dumber yet?<br>
<br>
Tell you what try something out, admit you got it wrong &#61514;<br>
<br>
‘’I do post mainly to troll and flex my excellent swearing skills’’<br>
<br>
Refer yourself to some Shriner posts for examples of well used swearing, it is not, as you seem to think, as case of:<br>
<br>
Fuck bastard cunt whore faggot etc etc etc<br>
<br>
You need a context upon which to weave the words.  Go read those shriner posts, see how lacking you truly are.<br>
<br>
‘’however how would posting on a message board inflate my ego?’’<br>
<br>
You tell me dorky, you’re the one trying to do it.<br>
<br>
<br>
‘’I truly pity you if you are that much of a walking sphincter that you take message boards as seriously as you appear to.’’<br>
<br>
Seriously? Hmm..interesting, I think they are an interesting and diverting microcosm of all that is worst and best in EQ.  They raise interesting issues and allow debate between people, they engender a sense of community, a place to trade and a good way to pass information about many things.  <br>
<br>
That’s how I see the boards, sadly I realise that for you its just somewhere to post:<br>
<br>
<br>
Fuck bastard fuck motherfucker whore etc etc etc<br>
<br>
In order to try and make yourself seem ‘the man’<br>
<br>
One day you may realise that people who ‘are the ‘man’  don’t actually need to try to convince everyone of that fact, or is that a bit deep for you?<br>
<br>
‘’ Let's look at this personal worth crisis issue, surely if I had a low self esteem I wouldn't have posted my picture up on the Emarr photos thread, I haven't seen your picture there Mitch, care to show us all what you look like? After you have posted your pic then and only then can we discuss the personal worth and self esteem issues again.’’<br>
<br>
Which school of logic did you go to again mr retard?<br>
<br>
Step One.<br>
<br>
Lets see if I follow you here, you post any old picture to an internet message board<br>
<br>
Step Two.<br>
<br>
You claim that this picture is yourself<br>
<br>
Step Three.<br>
<br>
You claim that because you posted ‘a’ picture that this means that you have great self esteem<br>
<br>
Your logic is non-existant, laughable.  Do you even understand what logic is?<br>
<br>
‘’Attempts at bullying? How the fuck can you bully someone on a message board?’’<br>
<br>
Your lack of social skills allows you no other context for understanding conflict that the physical world, you either deliberately deny or (more likely) genuinely don’t understand the ‘community’ you are in.<br>
<br>
‘’Obviously you are having flashbacks about what happens to you in the schoolyard playground everyday, you know where all the kids start chanting "Mitch , Mitch here comes the fat arse bitch, Mitch." You really do take this seriously don't you Mitch, if you think someone's words on a message board have the power to bully someone around then you are the biggest cum swallower that I have ever had the displeasure of knowing.’’<br>
<br>
Please dorkan,  go ask mummy if she swallows, then go ask daddy (on your next visit) if he likes it when mummy swallows.  I think you’ll find most girls do and most men enjoy it, so not much of an insult really is it?  Not for a female anyway.  <br>
<br>
<br>
‘’You should be the last person talking about immaturity Mitch, let's site the famous bracer example shall we? You see kiddies when Mitch gets into a tizzy with someone she likes to take it out on them by destroying some of their equipment, I think you better go look up maturity in the dictionary there Mitch, don't be too disappointed when you don't see your picture next to the definition.’’<br>
<br>
Although you lack principles so you never understood this matter, I’ll say again I stand by my actions on that issue and deny nothing.  Was it supposed to be a flame?  You see I’m proud that I stood to my guns and did what I considered right.  Thanks for reminding me though, I enjoyed the thread.<br>
<br>
Further please explain to me how having principles you stand by is immature?<br>
You constantly spout away and when you try and post what you consider to be smart comments your very misunderstanding of the words themselves shows you up, as I have repeated time and again, as an uneducated low intelligence little fuckwit.<br>
<br>
‘’Did I laugh to myself as I wrote that statement? Yes<br>
Did I laugh even harder as I thought "This will annoy Mitch"? Hell fuck yes and guess what it did.’’<br>
<br>
Annoy?  Well flies annoy me too, but I swat them also.<br>
<br>
<br>
‘’By your logic then, everyone who swears is an idiot with an ego problem, I think many people would disagree. I think I am conveying my message very well, after all you keep posting to have another crack at me, so I must be getting under your skin.’’<br>
<br>
Please refer to my earlier deconstruction of dork logic, hereafter called DOGIC<br>
<br>
‘’No I didn't follow you around, I read an article about you in "Lonely Fat Man-Whore Monthly Magazine" Remember that article where they did a short life story on you, I almost shed a tear when they got to the part where you explained what your daddy used to do to you with a cattle prod and electric can opener.’’<br>
<br>
Please tell everyone the Issue, page number, who wrote the article, unless its just more made up fantasised bullshit of course…….and btw is that magazine a good read?  LMAO<br>
<br>
‘’. As for the magazines , sorry to shatter your fantasy but I don't need them’’<br>
<br>
Except for ‘’ Lonely Fat Man-Whore Monthly Magazine’’  which you just stated you read avidly LOL<br>
<br>
 ‘’I do plenty well with the ladies in real life, thanks for being concerned though.’’<br>
<br>
Yes you obviously do so well with them that you read ‘’ Lonely Fat Man-Whore Monthly Magazine’’  too funny<br>
<br>
<br>
‘’The correct Gender is not Heroine at all, remember you are a man whore, .......oh sorry just realised you took another delusion pill and you are back in your happy world again, so maybe, just possibly you may be a heroine in your own imagination.’’<br>
<br>
Feel free to provide proof of your words, some people who walk these boards know what sex I am, not that I have ever pretended to be otherwise.  Of course if you cannot provide proof then I guess its just more made up bullshit, or was it deduced using DOGIC ?<br>
<br>
<br>
‘’Wow lots of spelling mistakes there you must of sure been angry’’<br>
<br>
That’s right, I never normally make spelling mistakes……..<br>
<br>
‘’As for the rest of that junk stop trying to play Sigmund Freud you aren't very good at it.’’<br>
<br>
Poor dorky, bit close to home?  Hit a nerve not already deadened by abuse??<br>
Tough shit.<br>
<br>
‘’I never denied the thread existed Mitch, you just keep telling yourself that for some stupid reason. What I denied was the fact I mispelled my own name in that thread. You should bring that old signature back, you know the one where you mispelled my name, I still haven't got over laughing at that one, you really should reside in a hardware store you are such a tool.’’<br>
<br>
Hmm no mention or response to my point (see earlier notes on ignoring points he cannot defend), namely that of threatening to hack people, very weak /yawn<br>
Nearly as weak as misspelling your own name lol<br>
<br>
‘’Yes the board admin proved to you that I never deleted it’’<br>
Deleted what?, it never existed right?  Right??  Oh you mean THAT post…etc etc<br>
<br>
Very funny stuff, nothing like catching someone out in a bare-faced lie.<br>
<br>
‘’but still you keep going on about it because it's the only thing you have left to cling to, poor Mitch. You should just admit you fucked up and spelled my name wrong in your sig, since you are so good at admitting when you are wrong’’<br>
<br>
Cut n Paste does not type fool, it merely copies.  I know its very embarrassing to admit you spelled your own name wrong, but just admit it and you’ll feel better.<br>
<br>
/chuckle <br>
<br>
<br>
‘’Once again lets look at the above quote and others you have made before, you say my posts have no substance and are nonsense, yet you can't help replying can you? You crave any type of attention that you can get, so sad that a message board is the only place you can get it.’’<br>
<br>
Please go find a mirror<br>
<br>
‘’My upbringing and family life was fine Mitch, thanks for being concerned though’’<br>
<br>
Sure it was, no divorce, beatings, abuse at all I bet<br>
<br>
/irony<br>
<br>
Just a regular normal kid next door, just like the ones with the trenchcoats….<br>
<br>
 <br>
‘’They are words only YOU can live by, Mitch first you are going to have to admit to yourself that you need help, however in your current state of denial I cannot see that happening.’’<br>
<br>
Yet again we see that having no mentality yourself you copy my own words in a vain attempt to post something worthwhile, I like the imitation but here’s atip for you, it looks lame on a thread like this.<br>
<br>
Like this:<br>
<br>
‘’Aww finally he says 'please' and begs for mercy. "Please Mitch don't pick my posts apart, you make me look so stupid and I don't think my shattered self esteem can withstand another battering"<br>
<br>
Understand?<br>
<br>
‘’For once I agree with you Mitch, you are right I am digging a hole, and I am about to chuck you and your coffin right into it.’’<br>
<br>
Bring it on, the more you post, the more people understand who and what you are.<br>
<br>
Heres a challenge for you, try making a post without a swear word in it.<br>
<br>
Mitch<br>
<br>
<br>
 <p>Bigger the sig, smaller the brain
<BR>

<br>
Yeah Mitch thats all I do I post up curse words and nothing else, one point you seem to be missing though is in between all those curse words I used in all my posts is that you wre getting a verbal beatdown, this is why you focus on the swear words, you are really trying to hold on to any little thing now, you are out of ammunition and running out of fuel faster than a 747 with all four of its fuel dump switches on.<br>

Here's another tip for you why don't you go home and lock yourself in your closet for the rest of your life, then you won't have to deal with all those mean bullies no more and we won't have to deal with you living out your delusional fantasies all over this message board.<br>
<br>
You and me must of been reading a different version of that post you keep referring too, such a shame it got deleted, I bet you are still sitting at my guilds message board hitting refresh as fast as you can, sweating and panting and praying that the post will come back, but guess what fuckwad?

Another example of how seriously you treat message boards, like I really give a damn what anyone thinks of me on here, the only reason I post is to get a reaction from retards such as yourself, most of the intelligent people on here just ignore me, that seems to be something you can't do, it's because you are seriously lacking in that intelligence department Mitch, it might come as a shock to you but I am sure another hit of one of those delusion pills will help you retreat into your special place.<br>

Mitch thinks all people who swear are trash, Mitch had more swear words in her last post than I did in this one, kind of says something doesn't it. <br>
<br>
Knock yourself out with your next post Mitch , I will read, disect, rip you to bits again and generally not give a damn. One day when you stop taking message boards so seriously you might be able to relax and have a good time too.<br>
<br>
And before you even bother Mitch, I understand your next line of attack is going to be about how obsessed with you I am because I want you to post your picture up here, but on that assumption you would be totally incorrect. I want you to post your picture up here because you are the one that always tends to go on about &quot;self worth&quot; and &quot;self esteem&quot; so why don't you do us all a favour and show us how big your self worth and self esteem are.<br>

Poor taste even for you<br>

I don’t filter them, I laugh at them.<br>

 ‘’If you swear you aren't intelligent?

Way to dodge again Mitch but if &quot;the internet&quot; means nothing why don't you post a picture of your self up here, after all it means nothing, right?<br>

Is that it?<br>
<br>
I mean I 'know' you dont understand some of my post because its so blatantly over your head, thats a given, but such one liners as:<br>
<br>
'talking in martian'<br>
<br>
or whatever it was you said is pathetically weak, i mean w e a k.!<br>
<br>
Are those totally meaningless imaginary one liners all you got?<br>
<br>
as far as spelling:<br>
<br>
'Mitch don't make me pick apart your posts for spelling and grammar mistakes'<br>
<br>
I don't care dorkwank, which if you had paid attention you would know (duh), you're the one bothered by it so i know it must have really annoyed you when I posted your own errors.<br>
<br>
Seriously, if you have some FACTS then post them because all this:<br>
<br>
'you are deluded blah blah<br>
'your ass is fat blah blah<br>
' -insert swaering here- blah blah<br>
<br>
Is mindless drivel<br>
<br>
POST SOME FACTS 'IF' YOU CAN<br>
<br>
but we both know you cannot, you're desperately treading water grasping at anything to retrieve your position but poor dorky, its already too late.<br>
<br>
let me save you some time;<br>
<br>
Mitch:  You are obsessed<br>
Dorkwank:  Your ass is fat<br>
Mitch:  your posts have no meaning<br>
Dorkwank:  You are dogfood<br>
Mitch:  You are displaying a lack of self image<br>
Dorkwank:  I read ‘’ Lonely Fat Man-Whore Monthly Magazine’’ <br>
Mitch:  Have you got anythign factual to say?<br>
Dorkwank:  Actually my friend bought it, i just read it<br>
Mitch:  Your board admin posted that you lied about the post on your board, got anything to say? <br>
Dorkwank:  your ass is fat and your keyboard covered with come<br>
Mitch:  (uses some irony)<br>
Dorkwank:  stop speaking in martian<br>
Mitch:  (uses a play on words)<br>
Dorkwank:  wtf you talking about fatass<br>
Mitch:  (uses sarcasm)<br>
Dorkwank:  Ahh you admit it (missing it of course)<br>
Mitch:  you really ARE that fucking dumb arnt you?<br>
Dorkwank:  la lala lala alala  your ass is fat.<br>
Mitch.....<br>
(tests something out)<br>
Mitch.............<br>
Mitch:  hmm...Zebra.<br>
Dorkwank:  ha you are deluded<br>
Mitch:  What time is it?<br>
Dorkwank:  your ass is fat<br>
Mitch....<br>
Mitch............................<br>
<br>
<br>
My job is done dorkwank, there is no more needs to be said as I know of no way to show you more plainly as the utter redneck low-grade interbred narrow minded little fucking gimp that you are, what truly amazes me, and i admit to being suprised by this.....<br>
<br>
..is that when i post using any kind of wordplay, said wordplay goes 100% totally over your head, i mean its fucking amazing that someone can have such a huge gulf in comprehension, can be so utterly lacking in understanding of their own language that they are unable to digest the written word.<br>
<br>
Your stupidity truly shocks me, and i REALLY mean that.<br>
<br>
Thankyou for helping me to show you for what you are.<br>
<br>
and now..<br>

I never stated that I was bothered by anything, have you ever thought about taking out a trademark on the word delusion, you were the only one bothered by spelling mistakes thats why you posted your silly little list in the first place, how does it feel to have your non existent victory shot down Mitch?<br>

You are so infatuated with Dwarkarn that you have to stalk him and go post a troll on his Guilds message boards just so he might notice you.<br>

You like to get into little spastic hissy fits and destroy loot that doesn't belong to you.<br>

You like to stand at the bank in front of n00bs and destroy several items that they can use and then go brag about it on the message boards just so you can feel more important.<br>

Sounds like you are really anxious to back out of this thread Mitch, is this your way of saying &quot;Bye Bye I am not posting anymore because obviously I have been beaten , but of course I am not going to admit it&quot;<br>
<br>
Back out of the thread if you have to Mitch I know your Mommy can't stay up and help you type all night, tuck yourself into bed and hide under your Barbie Fashion Designer bedsheets and maybe you might decide to try your hand at a reply in the morning. I would advise you against it though as any more moronic drivel from you will probably result in the men in white coats coming over to that hardware shop you reside in and locking you up for life.<br>

You don't have to thank me for allowing me to show what I am. My superiority was present from the first post in this thread and it wil continue untill the last post. I would like to thank you Mitch for the opportunity to allow me to verbally beat down on such a defenseless opponent.<br>

Really trying to back out now, your feet have been running so fast the only arse you have been kicking is your own. Thats it Mitch run away, run away, take another one of your pills and slip back into that happy place of yours, coward.<br>
