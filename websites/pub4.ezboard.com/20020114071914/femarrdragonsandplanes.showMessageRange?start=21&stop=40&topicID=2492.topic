Hey genius, the phrase goes &quot;would AS SOON,&quot;  not assume.  I'm guessing you heard that somewhere and were dying to repeat it, even though you had no clue what it meant, and got the words mixed up.<br>
<br>
And second, ya gotta love the hypocrisy.  You're giving the more then the &quot;time of day&quot; by taking the time to write out a long rant addressed to them.  I just love when the more dim-witted amongst us write about how certain  people are too pathetic to be worth their notice... and then go on to write a long flame about them.  Does the contradiction never occur to you?<br>

I suspect you'll invent other words to explain the discrepency which will, in fact, boil down to &quot;skill&quot;.<br>
<br>
Playing EQ well takes skill. Playing Quake well takes skill. Peeling an orange quickly takes skill. Getting a diploma in classical piano takes skill. Driving a car takes skill. Getting hopelessly drunk every night for a year and still passing your degree course takes skill. <br>
I've done them all and noticed that there are people who can't do them as well as I can, and other people who can do them much better than I can. Other than blind luck I fail to see any explanation for it.<br>
<br>
Are you all so pathetically desperate to prove how little EQ means to you that you degrade it at every possible opportunity?<br>

I would like to read from those who say EQ doesn't require skill to play what they mean by &quot;skill&quot;. I know Enchanters IG who are far superior in how they play the game than other Enchanters of equal level. How is that explained? Sure some will just flame with a &quot;fooking noob it takes no skill...&quot; but that is not really an explanation. If EQ requires &quot;NO skill&quot; then how can we explain why one player is a better puller, tank, caster, than another player? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ururaka.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ruraka</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/image/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 36<br> <font color=#E9D756>(10/5/01 9:33:02 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I just want to try again, so eat shit!</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> If EQ requires &quot;NO skill&quot; then how can we explain why one player is a better puller, tank, caster, than another player?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Knowledge (experience) makes someone a better puller, tank, caster, ect.  <br>
<br>
For example, I can pull ToV effectively because I have done it numerous times.  I can tell someone in my guild that the aggro range is about XX feet, and the only mobs that need to be split are at spot X, Y and Z on the map.  This new monk, he has never played a monk and I have played one for a few months, can now pull ToV just as well as I can.  Did I give him my skills?  No, I just told him the information about the zone, and it allowed him to play as well as me.  <br>
<br>
As a tank, a level 60 wizard in our guild can log on a 60 warrior and play main tank.  He knows to click taunt and kick whenever they pop up and stay close to the mob.  He learned all this in about 30 seconds of the &quot;true&quot; warrior telling him to click buttons and stay close to the mob.  Will the new warrior be any less effective than the old one?  No.<br>
<br>
As a caster, once again it comes down to knowledge and experience.  It might seem that the level 60 wizard is more &quot;skillful&quot; than the other wizard, but in reality it's just that the &quot;veteran&quot; wizard knows what spells land well against mob X, and therefore is able to do more damage.  If wizard 1 tells wizard 2 to cast an ice spell every 20 seconds, wizard 1's damage will equal wizard 2's damage.  Was wizard 1 more skillful?  No, he just had more experience.  Same goes for enchanters, after spending time in zone X, an enchanter will know what can/cannot be mezzed with what spells.  Is he more skillful than an enchanter who has never been to the zone?  No, he just knows more about the zone.<br>
<br>
If you consider knowledge a skill, then I will agree with you, EQ requires skill to play well.<br>

<br>
But that is how &quot;skill&quot; is obtained. We learn how to do something via knowledge and experience. Those who can repeat a process with success is said to be &quot;skilled&quot; at what they do. Am I right? Even the burger flipper at McDonalds is &quot;skilled&quot; if they can repeat their task with success over and over again.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ukemidra.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kemidra</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 52<br> <font color=#E9D756>(10/5/01 5:05:55 pm)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I just want to try again, so eat shit!</span><hr size=1> I dunno about &quot;more experience&quot; automatically equating &quot;better player.&quot;  I got my druid to 55 before I burnt out on her... and I thought I was a decent group player.

Forgetting to snare half the time, casting root (!!!) on mezzed mobs and casting DDs more often then any other spell.  I've seen level 20 druids that knew their class better then this chick.  <br>
<br>
I would say that there honestly is some skill involved.  Just because you're not doing something epic, doesn't mean it doesn't take a little bit of intelligence to do what you're doing.  I think the people that are saying it takes no skill, are saying that only because they have it in their heads that since this is a computer game and supposedly doesn't have much impact on real life, it takes no effort to be good at it.<br>

Um, what's wrong with that?  Enchie tashes and mezzes mob, mob is angry at enchie.  Mez breaks/wears off, rooted mob gives enchie a mean look.<br>
<br>
Played 25 levels in a regular group without a tank that could taunt (2 monks, bard, enchie, shaman).  Root on mezzed mobs is your friend.  <br>
<br>
On the subject at hand, I don't think EQ is a hugely difficult game, but there is a LOT to know, not only about your own class but about how you can best interact with the other classes during a fight, not to mention the game world (dungeons, mobs, how to find places, etc.) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ucarathosollathir.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Carathos Ollathir</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/image/globalRainbow.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 674<br> <font color=#E9D756>(10/5/01 5:58:13 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I just want to try again, so eat shit!</span><hr size=1> Think he's talking about druid root, which does damages so, in turn, breaks mez. <p><a href=http://www.afflictionguild.com/profile.php?username=Carathos&charactername=Carathos>Carathos Ollathir<BR><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/bthedruidsgrove> 60th Druid<BR> <a href=http://www.afflictionguild.com/>~Affliction~</a>

<br>
EQ takes skill to play, bottom line.<br>
<br>
Does playing sports take skill?<br>
<br>
For instance I played goalie for my high school hockey team.  The goalie before me can pass all the knowledge and tips to me as a freshmen benchwarmer that he wants.  Telling me what are opponent tendencies but the bottom line is it is up to me to take the tools that he gave me and utilize them.  I needed to have natural skills as well as aquired skills.  (Which obviously I didnt have cause I aint makin zillions of dollars in the NHL wahahahah)<br>
<br>
In the game certain people are better than others as stated before.  It was also stated that just telling the newbie what to do will make them just as good as everone else.  That statement is the biggest load of crap I have ever heard.  So you mean to tell me that everyone in the game is just as good as everyone else once you are told how to do something. ROTFLMAO.<br>
<br>
You can tell a person something but its up to them to take the tools and use them.  Some people are just to damn lazy and have no skills at all.  Take the Bard for instance.  I will gaurantee that most people who playd a bard and quit quit for one reason.  LAZINESS.  They did not want to take the time to learn how to SKILLFULLY twist songs.  They woould much rather play a Warrior and just click on butons and continue on there brainless existence.  And while I am at it let me state that playing a Warrior Takes no skill and if you have a warrior im sorry for hurting your feelings but all you have to do is hack away.  You dont have to worry about timing at all.  That is why I will never EVER (Y2J) play a Warrior now that takes no skill.<br>
<br>
EQ does take skill just passing on knowledge doesnt help anything especially with lazy peeps out there.<br>

It always boggles my mind when people talk about having skill in eq. I think the main things needed to be successful in eq is spending many many hours playing, and not being a jerk to everyone.<br>
<br>
God damn Ruraka i couldnt of said it better if i tried. If you got a brain and you know how to use it, you can play eq, period. Yeah i know some people REALLY suck, i've grouped with people in &quot;uber&quot; guilds who make me wanna scream cuz they suck so bad.<br>
<br>
I try not to let it bug me too long though, even good players mess up, i know there were times when i screwed up pretty bad. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/umuzaak.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Muzaak</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_lightning.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 49<br> <font color=#E9D756>(10/5/01 10:57:16 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I just want to try again, so eat shit!</span><hr size=1> Araya,<br>

I have no idea what you might think is a &quot;minimal amount&quot; of skill. I easily laught at those who toss around such words, since you obviously see yourself above others! Oh, well, such is life. There is always a dumb fuck who thinks they are better for some reason or other. Did it EVER occur to you that you may be ordinary? That you may actually be average and need others to help you perfect technique? I am astonished by the lack of comradere displayed on E-Marr and this board. Too bad, some really great people play on the server and we should all help and not inhibit what is good about this game. <br>

<br>
Putian is correct in thinking it takes no skill to play.  Up to his standard.  I remember grouping with you in OS, you were possibly the most tedious person i've ever grouped with. <br>
<br>
All these people saying it takes no skill... i've heard of maybe.. one? of you.  The aforementioned *monk*.  Chances are you haven't had to do anything that requires skill.  Killing in Dreadlands does not require any skill.  Killing in Sebilis requires very very vague human understanding skills, generally 8 years old and onwards have this ability.  Planning and leading raids takes skill.  Killing any dragon or higher end encounter takes skill on at least a couple of people's parts.<br>
<br>
Depends on the game you play.  If it takes no skill to play, why are you still wearing Treeweave's at lv 55+?  You saying you don't want to kill Trak? Klandi? Vindi?<br>
<br>
It takes no skill to be one of the 100,000 xp-sheep, correct.  Some of us worked hard to get what we had though, and being told that takes no skill by people who have never seen, never mind fought or killed, the things we planned and raided is just annoying. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/bemarr.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=patric>patric</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 743<br> <font color=#E9D756>(10/6/01 9:48:43 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: .</span><hr size=1> Pyra, you do have a point, really. Yeah some higher end raids take more time and effort than exp grinds. I dont wanna get into a flame war with you over different opinions, but in the end eq is just a game, not a very hard one either, like i said before, THE most important factor in eq is making friends with the right like minded people, and playing ALL THE TIME. I doubt anybody here can argue that.<br>
<br>
Maybe i am one of the 55+ treeweave (actually barbed ringmail <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ) exp grinders, you know why ? Not cuz i suck,  i've had my share of raids. Its because i cant play long enough, or at the right times to devote myself to a high end guild. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showMessageRange?topicID=2492.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a> <b>2</b> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showMessageRange?topicID=2492.topic&start=41&stop=51>3</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showMessage?topicID=2499.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showMessage?topicID=2507.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.emailToFriend?topicID=2492.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.threadControl?topicID=2492.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/deleteThreadFire.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=2492.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=2492.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub4.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="emarrmessageboardrules">Message Board Rules<option value="emarrlinks">Links<option value="emarrupcomingmmorpgs">Upcoming MMOG's<option value="emarrfrm16">The Emarr Quadrant<option value="emarrfrm18">America Under Attack<option value="emarrfrm19">Dark Age of Camelot<option value="emarrgeneral">General<option value="emarrfrm17">Funny Stuff<option value="emarrbazaar">Item Bazaar<option value="emarrscrollsnspells">Spell Bazaar<option value="emarrfrm15">Shiny Things<option value="emarrfrm14">Bargain Basement<option value="emarrdragonsandplanes">Rants and Flames<option value="emarrfrm13">Dragons and Planes<option value="emarrroleplaying">Roleplaying<option value="emarrroleplayingoocforum">Roleplaying - OOC Forum<option value="emarrscammeralert">Scammer Alert<option value="emarrsignaturecorner">Test Forum<option value="emarrreallife">Real Life<option value="emarrothermmorpgs">Other MMOG's</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#E9D756>- </font><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/bemarr>Erollisi Marr, The Queen of Love</a><font color=#E9D756> - </font><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes>Rants and Flames</a> <font color=#E9D756> - </font><br><br> <br>
