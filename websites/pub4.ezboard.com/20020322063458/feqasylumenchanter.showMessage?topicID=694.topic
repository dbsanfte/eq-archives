Another dumb chanter question</span><hr size=1> Okay.. here's the deal.. I was trying to save my butt, but someone else in the group (who said they had a level 55 chanter) yelled at me and said I was doing it wrong.<br>
<br>
spell line up (I was on debuff very little CC)<br>
<br>
1: Tepid Deeds<br>
2: Insipid Weakness<br>
3: Listless Power<br>
4: usually AE Stun.. but at the time was Random something<br>
5 Clarity/Haste<br>
6 AE Mez<br>
7 Tash<br>
8 Enthrall (Might've been to entrance.. I forget when I decided it was resisted too much and went back to enthrall)<br>
<br>
I usually have Tepid/Listless as my debuffs w/no shammy and root up.. not this time<br>
<br>
I was in Overthere which to me is known for being highly resistant mobs..<br>
<br>
Here is the situation.. a pull had more than we thought/adds or something.. don't remember exactly<br>
<br>
We had Warrior(twink w/ Lammys ie 55 Chanter alt)<br>
SK 35<br>
Druid 35<br>
Druid 31 or 32 druid<br>
Me 34 chanter<br>
<br>
I had two(maybe 3?) mobs beating on me at once.. the group was already engaged in something else and wasn't aware that I was getting the snot beat outta me yet but I was losing health too quick to depend on a save.<br>
<br>
I was being beat on by a sarnak berserker and knight (might've had a third on me also (Cockatrice).Berserker of course use a fast whip and I was concerned about getting a spell off.<br>
<br>
MY though was to BEST try to save my own butt (why I didn't have AE stun up.. I have NO idea) was to TRY to get off an AE mez and hope that it sticks on one or two and then try to run (providing my personal magic buffs meant I didn't get AE Mez'd also) and then run a little and try to handle the remaining mobs the fast way.<br>
<br>
Well I tried.. and failed to get any.<br>
<br>
The warrior then begin to put me down, talk about how they had a level 55 enchanter and I was doing it wrong. I should tash and mez.  Well I was grumpy =) at the way they came at me so I replied &quot;Tash? What's that?&quot; (I may not have exactly replicated what was said to me, but it did include a harsh tone, and it was NOT missed by the others in the group. I normally love suggestions on how to better play the class and save my own ass.)<br>
<br>
My question is.<br>
<br>
Since I was dumb enough to not have my AE stun.. was it better for me to attempt the AE Mez? or ?  How would some of you handle this?<br>
<br>
PS This warrior wouldn't taunt mezzed mobs.  Even if it was a caster that I'd tash/mez/mana sieve.  This of course meant the mob came after me at least one time.  Even after I'd asked for taunting on a previous mob, they didn't proceed to taunt.  This brings up a question on their suggestion of my tactics.  So I thought I'd throw it out there and see what pops up. <br>
<br>
I've read the chanter 101.. but I thought this might best be solved by asking in a line of questions.<br>
<br>
Thanks<br>
<br>
Edit: uhh.. spell check.. wonderful button meant to hit it, hit post instead<br>

Another dumb chanter question</span><hr size=1> No such thing as a dumb question  <br>
<br>
I strongly suggest dropping Listless Power and Insipid Weakness from your lineup. They just don't have enough effect on mobs to be worth the spell slots, mana useage, and aggro. I would replace them with two point-blank ae stuns.<br>
<br>
It's hard as hell to channel anything with three things beating on you simultaneously. The color series gives you those precious moments to more-reliably cast individual mezzes or an aoe - whichever you prefer.<br>
<br>
You say the warrior was not taunting ... well, if you land tash, mez, slow, listless and insipid on a mob it would be a challenge even for the SK to grab aggro. It also takes time for 2-3 taunts to cycle (that's what would be required to overcome that much aggro, if not more). DL is all about quick kills.<br>
<br>
That's why you should drop your dedicated buff slot (haste/clarity) and keep root memmed. That will keep the mob hitting the warrior (and the SK if he stands too close) and well away from you. <br>
<br>
I would not bother with mana sieve. The mob will be dead long before you make it go OOM, especially since you won't get a mana dot until 56. I only use it when fighting gating/complete-healing mobs that cannot be stunned.<br>
<br>
FYI my normal xping lineup looks something like this:<br>
<br>
Tash<br>
Single mez<br>
AE mez/charm (depends)<br>
Slow/buffs (swap)<br>
color stun 1<br>
color stun 2<br>
Theft of Thought (trust me you'll love this spell  )<br>
Root <br>
<br>
P.S.  The (alleged) level 55 no doubt doesn't remember all the mistakes he made.  I was totally clueless until level 30 or so - some say I still am <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>----------------------------------<BR>

Another dumb chanter question</span><hr size=1> well. Lot of ground to cover here:<br>
<br>
1st - You already admitted to not having your ae stuns up so..shame on you!!  I never went anywhere when experienceing without at least 2 color stuns up. They are just too valuable and will save your butt. <br>
<br>
2nd - AE mes is a great spell.....unless you dont have color stuns to back you up on resists. A resist on ae mes means you have a mob beating on you still and only have about 22 seconds to remez the others.(length of ae mes - spell cast time). This is ok with color stuns up but not without.<br>
<br>
3rd - Every member of a group is responsible for whats happening. One of those druids shoud be watching you like a hawk. Since they have no stuns like a cleric, they should of fired off a root or healed you. This would of drawn aggro away from you and given you a chance to regain control.<br>
<br>
4th - How did you draw aggro in the first place? If I had no stuns up on spell lineup I would be very carefuly about what aggros me. I would use single target spells Until I got the situation under control of realized I had no stun loaded and loaded it fast.( remember the page numbers these are on. If your quick during battle you can sit and grab the spell icon before you are forced back up. I used to do this occasionally when I didnt have a certain spell loaded. Yes you are gonna take max damage but if the situation requires it be used, Im not losing anything.)<br>
<br>
5th - We used to have to teach members of a group how to work with an enchanter. Most people just didnt understand the concepts until lvl 30ish or so. This is still true for any non twinks. However, now that I am involved with pickup groups again, I have found that a lot of clerics, druids, wizads, and shaman even around my level(60) do not crowd control. We need to educate the other classes on the value of stuns and roots.  Any class that has the ability to root, charm, or stun is also responsible for helping with crowd control. The best clerics will have their stuns and roots loaded during battle and use them to help you crowd control. Druids will use their roots/snares and speed(outside groups) to draw aggro and kite mobs away. Shaman will root mobs and nuke the crap out of a mob til it aggros them. Then they will just tank the mob until the chanter can deal with it more permanantly. Warriors or other tanks can even play a role in crowd control by simple tanking a mob until you can deal with it. This is hard for some people to understand because it may require that they die to deal with the problem.  But its better for one person to die then the whole group. Experience can still flow until that char gets a res or runs back. <br>
<br>
6th - I know you are too low but this is just a good all around suggestion for everyone. Keep allure wands from fear on you at all times! They have saved my ass more times then I can count in sticky situations.<br>
<br>
So in your situation, since the mobs were beating on you already, you probably did the best you could. casting AE mes was the right call.<br>
<br>
<br>
finally, some recommendations on your spell lineup:<br>
The only two debuffs you need to load is tash and slow. The others are pretty useless against mobs. They are only really useful in pvp when you are debuffing the strenght of a char so they cant move. I would recommend you dump the debuffs, even when a shaman is not around. My recommended spell lineup to anyone below fifty would be this:<br>
<br>
1)mes<br>
2)ae mes<br>
3)color stun<br>
4)color stun<br>
5)tash<br>
6)slow - with a shaman can be substituted for charm.<br>
7)root<br>

Another dumb chanter question</span><hr size=1> I'm just playing with IW, as it's a level 34 spells, and new spells I wanna try out for a bit.<br>
<br>
color flux 4 seconds<br>
color shif 6 seconds are all I have for color stuns yet..<br>
<br>
I felt REALLY dumb for not having the stun up.. and I was debuffin just to keep the SK from yelling 'debuff please' every 3 seconds.  Mainly I was using all the debuffs on tigers only (they hit hard)<br>
<br>
I was in OT not DL.. I'm skeerd in DL even running through it to get to LOIO.. lol..<br>
<br>
My point on the taunt is.. even one or two helps not just going up to it and whacking it.  Later on when the warrior had been kicked out of the group I don't think I got hit once (except for aggro).<br>
<br>
So I guess my main questions..<br>
<br>
What do people do to save your own butt when it comes down to it.<br>

Another dumb chanter question</span><hr size=1> Wow thanks Goshan and Tregath =)<br>
<br>
In response to Goshan (kinda already responded to Tregath)<br>
<br>
1) Yeah I know.. I asked tarot to change my post title to moron, but I don't think she's done it yet.<br>
<br>
2) AE mez is not something I normally use unelss I have root/stun up.. but.. well see 1.<br>
<br>
3) I did get healed once, that's how I survived before the SK took over.  I have about 400 HP and my AC sucks (I have a few raw silk items still I think).  It was the classic 'oh crap' pull of one or two.. ends up 3 and quickly add the 4th all at once kind of thing.<br>
<br>
4) I think my first aggro came on the pull of the 'two' where I tash/attempted to mez one of the Sarnaks (probably the bezerker as it was the 'lowest' mob)  I believe I took a forward stance on the pull so the 3rd joined in on beating me as I was between the group and the ruins.<br>
<br>
5) Yeah heck my warrior just got sat down about a week ago and taught 'how to be a main assist and help the cleric/chanter 101'.  I've taught a few people how to best assist me and it worked well.  The point was I was surprised the warrior who has the 55 chanter didn't do some of the things to assist me.<br>
<br>
6) What's an allure wand? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
<br>
Spell line:  I think I like it.. I had forgotten about my level 4 AE Stun.. I guess I should use that as the 2nd stun until I get better?<br>

<br>
They're the end all of "save your own butt" spells, because you can fire them off very quickly and really work quite well as a panic button of sorts, in addition to their usualy crowd control uses.  They give you precious seconds to get a heal, reassess the situation, and pop off a root or mez or whatever you need to do to gain control.<br>
<br>
In the situation you were in, without any stuns up, It's very difficult to channel through three mobs beating on you at once, but I'd probably have tried firing off a single target mez first, since it has a little less of a casting time, and therefore a bit better chance to channel through. <p><center><img src = http://members.bellatlantic.net/~mezner/daeonsig2.jpg><br>

If you have three or so inc let them crash into the tanks and then pick them off with single mezzes.  The tanks have the HP and AC to take the hits a lot better than you.  Hell, my level 25 warrior has as much unbuffed HP as I do at 60 :P<br>

If you get one or more mobs on you then color stuns are one solution.  The other is root.  There are some times when using color stuns will get you into more trouble than you are getting out of if it draws even more aggro onto you.<br>
<br>
If you are dealing with highly-resistant mobs then aoe mez would probably hurt more than help.  You'll succeed mainly in pulling all that aggro onto yourself (due to resists) and you may end up mezzing yourself to boot.<br>
<br>
As for the SK telling you to cast all these debuffs - tell him to like, hit stuff and be quiet. <p>----------------------------------<BR>

Its a wand thats enchanter only that has charges of &quot;Allure&quot; level 49 charm.<br>
<br>
I believe its no drop.<br>
<br>
I cant remember where it comes from though.<br>
<br>
I have one in the bank, forgotten about.  I have one of those mana draining wands in the bank too.  I guess i should carry em around with me.<br>
<br>
Everyone already covered ya on the questions, but just to echo what they say , lose all the debuffs except for tash and slow, and keep at LEAST one stun ( preferrably 2 ) up at all times in an exp group.<br>
<br>
My spell lineup at your level was exactly what goshan said ( probably from reading goshan's advice back in the day <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> )<br>

<i>1: Tepid Deeds<br>

7 Tash<br>
8 Enthrall (Might've been to entrance.. I forget when I decided it was resisted too much and went back to enthrall)</i><br>
<br>
Now, we all have our own way of doing things, but your spell lineup could use some work, I think.<br>
<br>
The five top slots that I use, which are practically inviolate are:<br>
<br>
1) Root<br>
2) Mez<br>
3) 20 stun<br>
4) 4 stun<br>
5) tash<br>
<br>
These are the bread and butter crowd control tools. <br>
<br>
Why root?<br>
<br>
Judicious use of root is a key crowd control skill. It stops runners, saves healers and nukers from overaggro... the utility uses are endless. Learn to keep a root memed at all times and learn to use it. Root will save your life a thousand times over.<br>
<br>
Why mez?<br>
<br>
Well, duh. This is how the vast majority of enchanters do crowd control. A very few prefer charm as their primary crowd control tool, but charming is high risk and unpredictable, while mez is low risk and very predictable.<br>
<br>
Why 20 stun?<br>
<br>
Your 20th level stun gives you enough time with some slack and without moving to slip in a mez or a root on a mob that is beating on you. Before you channeling becomes absurd in your highest levels, slipping in a stun gives you the time to cast that mez, even when multiple mobs are beating on you.<br>
<br>
Also, your PBAE stun is a damage mitigation tool. When your healers are screaming oom, casting your PBAE stun in range of the offending mob can save lives.<br>
<br>
You can stop runners with stunning if you are quick and well positioned.<br>
<br>
Lastly, when a break still results in aggro to you, stunning buys the taunting tank time to taunt it off you with damage or with their taunt ability. While stun does create aggro, the damage put out by the tank will offset this.<br>
<br>
Why 4 stun?<br>
<br>
The major benefit of the level 4 stun is its 1.0 casting time. You can get a level 4 stun inbetween the swings of a non-hasted mob with ease. Unless your connection is good and you have the speed to get range from a mob that is aggroed on you it isn't enough time to slip in a mez or root (( until you get immobilize, which has a low enough cast time to get in the time alloted by a 4 stun )) BUT, the 4 stun gives you the time to cast your 20 stun with ease and in style.<br>
<br>
So when a mob is aggroed on you, you cast your 4 stun, when it lands, you cast your 20 stun, and then you attempt to mez it. If you are resisted, the 4 stun has just about recycled by that time, giving you another bite at the apple.<br>
<br>
When more than one mob is beating on you, the fast cast of a level 4 stun may be what saves your life, becase you may not be able to channel through a 20 stun or mez through the damage and bashing.<br>
<br>
Why tash?<br>
<br>
Tash is our MR debuff. All our spells except for one and the tash line itself are magic based resist. Many utility spells such as snare, slow, root, and fear and many lines of damaging spells are also MR based. Tash helps the efficency of the group by reducing resist and increasing damage on MR based nuke + dot lines.<br>
<br>
Tash does create a lot of aggro, so learning the timing of it is the key to it's proper use. Don't tash mobs that haven't been aggroed on INC, because they will aggro you... it is better that they aggro the puller or one of the other tanks on INC because they are more equipped both HP and AC wise to handle a few stray blows while you get things under control.<br>
<br>
The exception to this is when mobs are very red to you and/or highly MR. You may want to tash first, which will give you at least a shot at landing a mez on the offending creature, while just a mez without tash would give you close to a zero chance of landing a mez.<br>
<br>
As to your other spells, I suggest a slow, a buff/nuke swap slot, and either AE mez or charm, depending on what your are comfortable with.<br>
<br>
Why slow?<br>
<br>
Slow increases the group efficency dramatically. It reduces damage output, which means that healing mana is saved. If the healers have mana, you can pull more. If you can pull more, you get more xp. This makes everyone happy.<br>
<br>
Also, if mobs are slowed, if they aggro on you because you mistime a mez or because there is an inadvertent break of mez, or if they charge you despite the efforts of your tanks, they will do less damage to you, there will be more time inbetween their swings, giving you more chances to deal with the situation though root or stun.<br>
<br>
Why a buff slot?<br>
<br>
While the duration of your current haste isn't all that great, if you have it cycled, you still only need to pull it out every 14 mins or so. There isn't a lot of point keeping it memed all the time. You can put the slot to better use.<br>
<br>
Same with clarity or other assorted buffs like our AC buff, a WIS/INT buff or cha. They aren't needed all the time, so it is best to pull it out only when you need it.<br>
<br>
When you don't need the slot for buffing, try meming a nuke if you have mana to spare on it. It can help increase kill rate to chip in some damage. While our nukes are not time or aggro efficent, they can help. Plus it is fun to blast away once in a while.<br>
<br>
Why AE mez or charm?<br>
<br>
I feel more comfortable with charm, never really liking AE mez as I leveled except for specific situations, but some people thrive on AE mez... so if that is a tool you feel comfortable using, keep it handy. <br>
<br>
Charm can add a lot of risk to a group, but the reward in added damage can bring a lot too.<br>
<br>
Why not stat debuffs?<br>
<br>
They are mana inefficent. They don't seem to provide a lot of benefit for their mana expenditure. They bring a disproportionate amount of aggro on to you by their casting for their effect. By the time you have fully debuffed a mob that your party is working on, they are probably mostly dead at that point.<br>
<br>
If you have spare mana, try nuking the blue cons instead. A tashed blue con of average MR won't resist you that much, and you can lop off a fair chuck of their HP with just one blast. <br>
<br>
Why not mana seive?<br>
<br>
In OT I can't think of any casters you would be pulling, so there isn't any real reason to seive them. Seive is more of a strategic tool in raid situations and specific post 55 mobs. You really shouldn't be using it, because it will take vast amounts of your mana to seive down even run-of-the-mill casters at your level. Stun them to stop their casting instead. Encourage your cleric and wizard to do the same.<br>
<br>
What should I be doing in a group?<br>
<br>
Single mobs:<br>
<br>
The puller will tell your group what is INC.<br>
<br>
The main tank will engage the mob, give them a moment to build some aggro. It may take you some time to learn how much aggro that particular tank can draw in a given amount of time based on their level and weapon selection. One thing to note is that the taunt skill is mostly ineffective on mobs that con highly to the tank in question. Moderate your timing accordingly.<br>
<br>
Cast a tash. Hopefully your snarer has learned not to cast snare immediately upon the mob's arrival... because around 30 mobs start to really hate being snared and they will often draw aggro. If you are tashing religiously and your snarer isn't waiting for it, have a little heart to heart with them in /tell so that you can coordinate your spells. Call out your tash in the beginning of unknown group situations, but when things are running smoothly, you don't need to call it out anymore because people will expect you to be doing your job and they theirs.<br>
<br>
Once your tash has landed and you do not have aggro, if you are the slower, cast your slow. It will probably land on the first try on a tashed mob. If it doesn't, pause a bit to let the tanks take some more aggro, gauge to see if slowing this mob will be mana efficent based on it's remaining HP and try slowing it again.<br>
<br>
If you are not the slower, because you have a shaman, try blasting the mob if you have mana to spare when it is below 50%. If your tanks are building adequate aggro, you shouldn't have any problems about drawing aggro with your nuking. Two nukes is usually excessive, though.<br>
<br>
If you have a shaman, you can help share the slowing duties with them. Our slows aren't that different in power at that point, and if the shaman is performing healing buffing and other duites, being able to use your mana helps keep the mana levels of the group balanced. Your mana should be around the same as the healers and nukers mana in a good xp group. This shows that people are using the correct amount of mana for a given situation, yet still have a reserve for unexpected circumstances. If you have a lot more mana than the healers, try blasting more. If you have a lot less mana than the healers, you may be coming off a buff cycle, or you may be slowing too much. Every Single Mob doesn't need to be slowed, it typically wears you out and leaves you with little mana, and if the group has sufficent DPS and levels to deal with what is coming at a goodly clip, the healers may be overflowing with mana.<br>
<br>
The mob dies, someone loots, and you start over.<br>
<br>
Multiple mobs:<br>
<br>
If there are multiple mobs INC, hopefully the puller will tell you so you can stand up. Learning to stand up on INC mobs is a good habit, because you aquire a substantial amount of aggro in certain situations from sitting. Because you are out-of-doors, target a mob as soon as you can and mez it as soon is it comes within range. Spam your mez key so you can get the spell started at the maximum possible range. If you are not resisted, great! Target any other mobs and mez them too.<br>
<br>
If you are resisted, try to slip in another mez. You probably won't be able to complete the casting before the mob engages you, but you can get most of the spell complete, giving you a good shot at channeling it though. If this isn't successful, womp it with your level 4 stun, and then your level 20 stun, and then mez it. If you are resisted yet again, channel through a tash and try stunning it again. If your other group members are smart and aware and see you in distress, they may support your efforts by rooting or stunning the mob themselves. This buys you time to try to land another mez or back away and mez it at your leisure.<br>
<br>
Positioning:<br>
<br>
It is good to stand a bit away from your group. Aggro, based on mobs, is somewhat proximity based, so standing a bit away from your group helps keep aggro from your healers. Also, if you stand back and away a bit, if give you a clean line of sight to mez mobs as they are incoming. Finally, sometimes pullers will pull mobs across groups, and you don't want to be sitting in their midst and getting hit as they go by because of sitting aggro.<br>
<br>
On the mez break:<br>
<br>
Stand on mez breaks.<br>
<br>
Don't be in melee range of the mob.<br>
<br>
Don't berate your tanks if you get charged after a break. They are probably doing all they can, but they may not have the level to hold aggro with taunt during a break.<br>
<br>
Do debuff your mezzed mobs situationally. Tash them. Slow them. Anything more than that is excessive and probably wasted mana. If your meleers are having trouble taking aggro after a break, don't debuff the mobs... wait until the MT has built some aggro after break.<br>
<br>
Let the melees and other classes know what skills they can use to help on breaks. Paladins can stun and root. SKs can cast a dizzying array of dots and debuffs which create lots of aggro. Clerics and wizards can stun the mob on break if it shows signs of running at you (( or a healer! )), giving the tanks some more swings and opportunities to taunt. Mages can use an air or earth pet. Aggro control is a community effort, and everyone can do their part.<br>
<br>
On AE mez when you are being thrashed:<br>
<br>
AE mez's cast time is slightly longer than regular mez. This gives more opportunity for mobs to beat on you, increasing your chances of interrupt. Also, you can mez yourself, which isn't so hot, but usually not the end of the world. I suggest using your stuns and single mezzing offending mobs thrashing on you rather than AE mezing.<br>
<br>
On dealing with snotty people who have high level chanters in your group:<br>
<br>
Tell them to /tell Olenari, and I'll set them to rights. =D<br>

I'm playing with 34 spells man compared to other stuff that new nuke is nice (280 damage? or something) woot! but heh.. I don't think I'll ever use it unless I have no CC duties.. and I know it will finish off the mob for a 'woot! look who killed it' kind of thing..<br>
<br>
On the debuffs.. I got 34 Saturday 35 sunday.. playing w/ new spells.. I think I was lookin at it while playing the massive debuff line (later on we had two chanters in the group.. one was on buffs.. I was on debuffs.. I was casting around 300 mana per mob debuff if I did full debuffs.. it was CRAZY.. i'd never do that w/o another chanter in the mix.<br>
<br>
I just want to thank everyone again for the ideas..<br>
<br>
Personally I would've NEVER thought about using that level 4 stun, but I'm gonna give it a try =)<br>
<br>
IF I can get in the game.. dammit<br>
<br>
edit: I'm pretty light hearted if I get charged.. I usually laugh and run around in short circles to try to keep from getting hit.. but giving them not much of a moving target.. OR I'll just stand there /g enchanTANKing!<br>
<br>
My main is/probably always will be a warrior.. I just learned the bash/taunt routine to regain aggro and give the chanter time to mez it while I control the aggro/hitting/stunning<br>
<br>
2-3 hits I'm fine.. try to handle it myself, then I have the /help button set up<br>
