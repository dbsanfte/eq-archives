I debated whether to put this up or not, but seeing as I don't know if Duff was banned or merely suspended, I want to give you all a heads up. If he comes back, consider yourself warned.<br><br>Friday night, Duff's alt Tigerti was charging 20pp a port. My guild member Paxzon, agreed and payed him the 20pp. Duff then disbanded the group mid-port, so that only he ported away. I am told he did this multiple times to many different people. Paxzon told the guild, and another guild member came to his defense and tried to talk to Tigerti. Tigerti immediately went on the offensive, throwing insults about this guildmember, Paxzon, and the guild in general.<br><br>The first I knew about this incident was yesterday, when one of my officers, Mukhtar, told me. Paxzon is fairly new to both the guild and EQ in general, and he is the brother in law of two of our more longstanding and honorable members. I was angry that someone would stoop so low as to scam not only him, but multiple other people as well in such a manner, but since Paxzon did not wish to give me the name and the other member who assisted him the night before was not on, I let it pass.<br><br>Fast forward several hours. Mukhtar was not online and I was busy in WL engaging in an rp farewell event for Gelain, when I recieve a tell from Paxzon, asking how one called a gm. Startled, I asked him what was wrong and he told me that Duff, the alt of Tigerti, was sitting at the orc camp in EC where he and his group were hunting. Duff was taunting and insulting Paxzon, while simutaneously stealing every orc that popped. I do not know Duff's class or level, because he was using roleplay, though Paxzon did say he was in wolfform and casting a lot, so I will hazard that Duff is/was a druid. I did get his guild name, but no other members were on at the time. Paxzon knew Duff and Tigerti were the same person, because Duff himself said so. According to Paxzon, when his group confronted Duff and asked him to stop, Duff threatened them, and even said &quot;I'll come and kill you in RL&quot;, which of course is absurd, but it is a personal threat all the same.<br><br>I told Paxzon to /report that threat, but by the time I did, it had already scrolled completely away with all the battle spam. So I told him how to petition, and I said I would do the same. But first, I sent Duff a tell. This is my conversation, word for word, with him:<br><br>You told duff, 'Excuse me sir.'<br>[Sat May 12 17:24:27 2001] Gelain begins to cast a spell.<br>[Sat May 12 17:24:32 2001] Duff tells you, 'wat'<br>[Sat May 12 17:24:33 2001] Viren fades away.<br>[Sat May 12 17:24:36 2001] Gelain begins to cast a spell.<br>[Sat May 12 17:24:37 2001] Duff tells you, 'wat do you want'<br>[Sat May 12 17:24:41 2001] Gelain fades away.<br>[Sat May 12 17:25:05 2001] You told Duff, 'I am Paxzon's Guild leader.

And I will ask someone else in your guild'<br><br>Unfortunately, there was no one else in his guild on, so that avenue was not open. I petitioned. About five or ten minutes later, Paxzon told me a guide was there, and her name. At this point, he was extremely upset and wanted to log, but I told him it would be best if he stuck it out so he could give his side of the story. I sent the guide a tell saying that I also petitioned and was Paxzon's guildleader, and I told her the contents of my own conversation with Duff. The guide sort of laughed and said he was &quot;digging his account a very deep grave&quot;. <br><br>I waited several minutes, until Paxzon sent me a tell saying that Duff had just disapeared. I did a /who gm and saw that the guide too was gone. A little while later, a different guide sent Paxzon a tell saying that Duff shouldn't bother him any more, and to enjoy his gaming experience.<br><br>I do not know what happened to Duff, whether he was banned or merely suspended. I certainly hope its the former, but just in case, I would like to warn lanys about this guy.  <p><center><img src="http://guardiansofdawn.homestead.com/files/sigjeanfin.jpg"> <br /><i>Guildmistress of </i><b><a href="http://www.geocities.com/guardiansofdawn" TARGET=_blank>Guardians of Dawn</A></b><br /><b><i>Kamikaze Ranger of Lanys T'vyl</i></b><br /><br />"Did you think a little thing like the end of the world was gonna do me in?"<br /><br />"The Reaper is always just a step behind me ..."</center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uowens66.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Owens66</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t d00d!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(5/13/01 5:48:48 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=518.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> real life</span><hr size=1> This seems just mean, and pointless. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ukasoline.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kasoline</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>w4nn4b3!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(5/13/01 5:50:37 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=518.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Duff / Tigerti</span><hr size=1> Sounds like a complete jackass to me.  <br><br>/nod<br><br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/umacathenecro.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Maca the Necro</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I live here.. get out.</span><br> <font color=#000033>(5/14/01 3:13:22 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=518.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Duff / Tigerti</span><hr size=1> I'd like to shitlist duff for having the best damn name on the server. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><center><table width=362 height=177 bgcolor="#000000"><tr><td><center><img src="http://nikto.members.easyspace.com/mysig.gif" alt="what's crappenin?"></center></td></tr></table></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/urabrik.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Rabrik</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>p0\/\/3r-p0sT3r!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(5/14/01 12:19:31 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=518.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Duff / Tigerti</span><hr size=1> Duff = Brenil lingo for Dwarves <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br>Dunno this guy, but from that log he wasn't too bright...kinda like Duffs <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><img SRC="http://user.netomia.com/dammned1/sig2.jpg"></br>Brenil Rko'Seropian</br>53rd Heretic of The Forgotten Council</br><br><br>"....Excuss me, while I...whip this out..."</br></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/usadorf.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sadorf</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>w4nn4b3!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(5/14/01 12:54:10 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=518.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Duff / Tigerti</span><hr size=1> Wow, the name did not ring a bell at first, but that is because I have not seen this guy around for awhile - and he certainly seems like a different person now.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :/ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":/"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br><br>I grouped with Duff in the Oasis and in TD a few times - we'd double team crocs or ogres or bandits for some good exp.

It had to be the worst experience I had had on this Game.  I am new to this game and I love it to say the least.  I have been taken in and treated well by my guild and made to feel at home, even though most of the people in my guid out level me by 30 or more.  Kelnya posted the whole event as acurately as it happend.  This guy was totally ruining a good day of adventuring and gouping with good people.  We lost several members of our grp because they just could not take anymore of this guy.  Now this may seem really babyish and Newbie whining, but imagine you are new to the game and you are spending alot  of time just trying to get levels and exploring the Game loving every minute of it, when up comes somone who can ruin all yor fun just because he is way higher in level and ther is nothing you can do about it, or so u thought.  This guy was not letting us kill anything and threatend us both RL and in the game.  We were going to move  our whole camp and go somwhere else to get exp.  This guy tells us that no matter where we go he was going to follow us and make  sure he ruined our gaming today.  It was his goal in life to ruin gaming for newbies.  That was when we lost a couple of people who just werent having any fun and decided to leave.  This guy then tell me &quot;Do u remember me Paxzon U should.&quot;  I reply with no should I. <br>&quot;Want your 20P back where is your guild mates now NEWBIE LOSER&quot;  Then It dawns on me who this guy is.  He then proceeds to tell us that he was just haveing fun with me the night before and was going to TP me just wanted to have soem fun with us.  I was really getting tired of this guy and he was ruining a good day so I figured oh well I will log and go do something else even though I wanted to play EQ.  I was saying goodby to my guild when they tell me it would be best to stay on and just  wait for a GM.  You knwo the rest except that later that day I actually did get some fighting in and was able to make 12th lvl.  Hopefully I never run into any players as demented and ruthless as this guy to all the good Roleplayers and Gamers of Everquest I applaud u for making gaming as fun and enjoyable as it has been.<br>                               Thanks <br>                               PAXZON 14LVL WIZARD<br>                               GUARDIANS OF DAWN<br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uwinsomecannon.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Winsome Cannon</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t d00d!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(5/18/01 2:36:33 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=518.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Duff / Tigerti</span><hr size=1>  Paxzon it doesn't sound like whining or being a newbie at all.

I hunted with him with one of my other chars when i was like lvl 1-15, and he kept asking me for shiznit. He still has yet to get above lvl 35 i believe is what he told me a couple weeks ago... So hes not out there to game/lvl etc, hes out there doing something else. =( He has a little brother i beleive and his little bro plays his chars when hes not on. As for tigerti, ya he has f#$ked up and it sounds like he needs to start over (which i actually believe hes tryng to do on another char). But it seems kinda irrepairable.
