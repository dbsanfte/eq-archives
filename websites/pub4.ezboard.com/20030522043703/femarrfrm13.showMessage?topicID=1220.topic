Having only recently levelled to such a point that I can join raids, I jumped at the opportunity.  Some of you will recall that I posted here a couple of months ago, wanting to pick up on some raid-leading tips....  Well, I've been taking EVERY raid I can, so I can learn as much as possible.  This was the first Vox raid I attended, and 3rd that I've watched.<br>
<br>
All went smooth as silk up to the point that we were coming back in from the chats.  Someone either called charge, or just led a charge on their own against Vox, while half of us were finalizing buffs, getting into groups, and whatnot.  Because half of the raid force was still in buff hall, we hit her with a staggered force.  Due to the ensuing confusion, her CH's pretty much kept her "complete."  It was a total, and brutal wipe out.  CR took forever, and we lost a good number of people.<br>
<br>
Puretune, after some harsh (IMO, rash) words, logged.  I hope he's calmed down some, and feeling a little better.  Given the 4 people that we had still interested, I decided to press the issue.  I said that I was going to lead the raid.<br>
<br>
Now, some of you know who I am.  Others don't.  For those, I'll digress briefly, and explain.  When I play a Bard... I play a Bard.  I get out, I RP, I tell stories, and I make friends.  As many as I can.  If those friends have friends, so much the better--that's a contact network.<br>
<br>
Tonight, I decided to try using that to it's full extent.  Between people knowing people, and the old "My sister's roommate's cousins pharmicists..." gag, we managed to pull together 5 very good groups to go back up against Vox.  With the help of my lovely wife, Zerythi, the Noble Josephia, and Wise Caanus, we marched through all opposition, like cake... until we got to Buff Hall.  Word came down that there was a patch, and we had 2 hours.<br>
<br>
I should have called the whole thing off, there.<br>
<br>
Instead, in high spirits, we all pressed on.  We gathered up, went through Buff Line extra fast--Our people were GREAT here.  Everyone listened, and did as they were asked.  I was really blessed, at this point.  When all buffs were done, and things were ready, we made sure groups and buffs were current, lined up on the ramps, and charged Vox.<br>
<br>
We tore that frozen b?tch to pieces.<br>
<br>
We had a group of all Paladins--save for one cleric--who's sole job was to interupt Vox's heals.  They did a great job.  Our group of Wizards and Enchanters took her apart very quickly, and tanks were spectacular at dealing more damage than I like to think about.  They held agro, right to the end. Then, I went LD...  Almost all melee's died in the first charge, but with casters bound in the buff hall, we were taking her down.  (I was watching from Zerythi's computer.)  At the critical moment, Zery's blast went off, and took her down to no visible life.  Zery died in the AE, but still--admirable.  Valpic was in the process of casting the nuke that would kill her... until, from somewhere, a Dire Wolf showed up behing him, and began eating all of our casters.<br>
<br>
At that, the raid was lost.  Those casters fought SO HARD to get in there, and finish her... but in 2 waves of caster deaths, she worked up enough mana, and CH'd herself.<br>
<br>
The raid was over.<br>
<br>
Time until patch?  00:28:00<br>
<br>
This had to be a FAST CR.  Thing were going okay, until someone manged to pull a Giant Wooly Spider, an Ice Giant Magus, and Lady Vox (all at different times) into the Buff Hall.  I don't know who pulled what, or how.  I don't care.  All I know is that CR was massacred.  I was one of those fortunate to get a rez--but it took place AT Buff hall, then servers dropped.<br>
<br>
Just to cite one caster?  I know we had a druid who was nearly 53, who lost 52.  Zerythi died 6 times.  Went from 51 to having only a SLIVER of Xp into 50.<br>
<br>
This was the first raid that I led.<br>
<br>
What have I learned, though?<br>
<br>
1)  Don't be too eager to pick up someone else's garbage.  We were working with people who were already tired, and who'd been through a lot, already.  Not to mention that I was getting sleepy.<br>
<br>
2)  Be aware of your time table.  We had a VERY small window to get this done in.<br>
<br>
3)  Always take time to plan.  Pick-ups are fine.  Picking up the remains of pickups is asking for a repeat.<br>
<br>
4)  Make sure your people know what they are doing.  Someone made an honest, uninformed mistake, or they were merely feared into the pit.  As a result, we all lost XP.  Some of us could lose corpses.  No one got any loot.<br>
<br>
5)  LISTEN TO YOUR RAID LEADER!!  It doesn't matter how stressed, panicked, or knowledgeable a person is.  When someone is leading the raid, you're consenting that your life is in that person's hands.  If you don't want to follow them, get TL and leave.<br>
<br>
6)  Don't be too eager to lay blame on someone.  Honest mistakes happen.  People don't always know the best way to do something.  That is okay--even if it costs a lot of people a death.  We're all learning something new.  A VERY costly lesson, but an important one.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I intend to lead more raids, in the fairly near future.  I need more practice, and I'm committed to learning and to performing well.  The most important thing I learned is not to get down on myself.  Just dust myself off, wipe away the blood, and get going again.<br>
<br>
If anyone has questions or advice, please let me know.<br>
