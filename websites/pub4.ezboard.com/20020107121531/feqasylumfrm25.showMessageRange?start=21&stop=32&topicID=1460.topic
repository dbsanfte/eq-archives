I was cleric in a group with 1 warrior, 1 paladin and 3 rogues, and was almost the last person standing so had a fairly good view of how it went, healers/casters perspective.<br>
<br>
In my group, the group pally died as he DA-pulled, fair enough. The rest did not fall especially fast. One rogue fell fairly early, the warrior and one rogue midway through, and one rogue was almost the last person to fall before I died myself under the dragon's claws, OOM by that point and eating dropped mod rods (which were in plentiful supply, this was not the problem). After my last groupmate died, I had just enough mana from mod-rodding to throw a couple of quick remedies on Kuwen, who was still up, before Doze took exception to this, slew Kuwen and then me in about one second lol.<br>
<br>
The problem was not the early deaths of the (melee) damage dealers. The problem was aggro control and nothing else.<br>
<br>
Doze was ping-ponged from side to side like no-ones business. No-one at this level can debate really, if a mob this nasty is running around, the greatly reduced damage from all melee who are forever in pursuit and the massive AE damage having to be soaked up by the casters/healers as a result of it being dragged amongst us repeatedly (killing many) is going to scupper the attempt.<br>
<br>
During the fight I had to swap sides repeatedly, taking AE damage each time, and this means every other caster/healer (that lived) had to as well. I stayed alive only because I &quot;wasted&quot; mana healing myself, as I had enough left to keep others up and dieing early would have been bad.<br>
<br>
For the next attempt, it is absolutely vital that Doze is pinned in one place and held there, so only the melee are taking the AE. Other than that, the attempt was not half bad at all, the fight went on for quite some time before the inevitable came. As I died, Doze was on 60% health. If we had pinned him in one place, I think we had the damage dealing capability to win that fight last night. <br>
<br>
Was fun trying! Next time! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

Since our idea was to not to fight him in the corner but rather under the banner, I called switch and rotated around to get him pushed away from the pot.  I think the rotating pushed me off top of the agro list.  I need to work on this skill.  At this point I lost agro and he pinged-ponged killing a few people finally settling at the casters spot.  I was actually able to get agro for a bit after all the pinging.  He was turned to me and was gradually being pushed back towards the banner area with most of the rogues and melee standing in the caster spot.  Somewhere in this time I noticed Shroud of Hate on me which I think is a slow.  And I also noticed I was loosing agro control and the pinging started again.  At this point I lost agro and never got it back again.  So the two questions I have are, should we go back to our original plan of getting the main tank in the pot corner which seemed to work well for us on the second run last week, and how much of a deterent is Shroud of Hate in holding agro?  Is it enough that we should switch tanks if the first tank has it casted on them?<br>
<br>
BTW, my weapons are 10 18 with a self buff proc in onhand and 18 30 in off.  In general I believe these weapons have taunting ability very close to epics.       <p><font size = 1><center><i>Then she let her hand fall, and the light faded, and suddenly she laughed, and she was shrunken: a slender elf-woman, clad in simple white, whose gentle voice was soft and sad.

Personally I think keeping him in one corner, with his back exposed is the best thing to do. Saves everyone from having to move around constantly, and will allow casters to duck out when they don't want to get hit by the AE, instead of them having to switch sides several times, in which like Feli said...they were getting hit by the AE then. <p><FONT CLASS=Arial-16pxb>Kodylan Stompioras
