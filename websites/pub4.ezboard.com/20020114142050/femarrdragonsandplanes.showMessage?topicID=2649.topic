When I came back on I saw people saying they lost xp so I look at mine and yep instead of being 1 blue from 43 I am now 3 for a net loss of 2 blue bubbles.  It is late at night and I went on the chat and the GM in chat told us to petition.  So I go nack on and petition saying I want a rez of my 2 blue bubles I lost.  Did a /who all GM and no one was one.  After I petitioned I went to bed because I had work in 5 hrs.<br>
<br>
I get up before going to work again and logged on xp still missing so I petitioned again and a guide responds.  And he says we have no record of the DL zone crashing and I cannot give you your xp back.<br>
<br>
So I tell him there was a DL crash (and from what I saw in chat a FV crash) and that I will get other witnesses and that I have to goto work and dont have the time to waste arguing with a guide.<br>
<br>
So are there anyone that was in DL last night at 1230am PST that was in that crash.  If so did you get your xp back.<br>
<br>
I have had a terrible 2 days.  Got my car totaled and now loosing xp.  Sure 2 blues in a non hell lvl doesnt mean much but it's the principle of that friggan guide calling me a liar when at least 15 others crashed with me.  Him saying I just went LD is the most idiotic moronic thing I have ever heard.  (Have cable and have NEVER EVER gone LD in 6 months) And if he doesnt have on record of a whole zone going down then Verant has some shitty ass turnover.  And I hope a guide reads this so they can get there heads out of ther arses.  I wont stop untill I prove that guide was wrong.  I know the damn zone crashed and am entitled to the xp res and when I do get it ill just wave goodbye to that GM.<br>
<br>
If you were in that DL crash did you get your xp back and did you petition.  Its about time we proove these almighty GM and guides wrong.<br>

Where the fuck did he call you a liar.. and in regards to giving you the exp back did you have a corpse .. from what you posted it doesnt look like you died when you went link dead thus how is a guide going to give you exp back.. <br>
<br>
big fooking deal its a lost of exp .. its not like he kicked your dog or something .. <br>
<br>
and oh if you do prove that dl crashed if you didnt die there is no way a gm or guide can magically give you exp .. <br>
<br>
so fight the fight big guy .. i will just stand here and laugh <br>
<br>
oh in regards to going ld and being on a cable modem maybe you and the 15 others all connect thru the same router .. and maybe that went down .. or maybe you all are on @home and it crashed.. just because your on a cable modem doesnt mean you wont go ld .. <br>

Yes there were only about 15 people in DL it was 1230 am PST.  EVERONE THAT WAS THERE GOT DA BOOT.  Including my whole group.<br>
<br>
2.  I am sick of Verant lovers always giving the excuse it was my ISP.  HORSESHIT it was not my ISP so just suck it.  Get a better excuse it seems blaming the ISP is the only thins Verant knows how to do.<br>
<br>
3.  I already said I dont care about the xp or cant you read?  Its the principal of the thing.  I KNOW THE ZONE CRASHED AND WILL FIND THE OTHERS that were in my group.  The guide said he had no knowledge of it happening.  I am out to show him his deficeincies and have them fixed.  Ever heard of doing a turnover when coming off shift but I guess there are no shifts or any type of logs kept.<br>
<br>
4.  I petition right after the crash happened b4 i went to bed.  Don't they keep petitions in an archive?  I know that at my business we keep things for at least a month let alone 12 hours they should be able to find my first petition and see that I am not scamming.<br>
<br>
5.  And to the person who asked if I had a corpse no I didnt and dont any of you people find it weird that I lost xp along with others and there is no corpse?? THINK THINK THINK.<br>
<br>
Use your head its that lump located 3 ft above your arse (What movie is that from?) :P<br>
<br>
6.  The only time i have ever and i mean ever been kicked off is when the power went off and the power did not go off.  There was no corpse, I wasnt killed and I lost xp. Hmm thats peculiar(sp?).<br>
<br>
I am not in it for the xp but I am in it to proove that friggan Guide know it all wrong.  And weather you like it or not its gonna happen.  And I will repost with the names of people that were in DL when it crashed just to proove you wrong.<br>

Again I did not have a body and lost xp which seems to be the same as when I left Sol for DL.<br>
<br>
And being in hawaii I have played in DL at 120 am PST and yes there are only about 15-20 people in DL at that time FYI for the person who thinks there are always 70 people there.<br>

<br>
The other thing I want brought up is turnover?  Is there turnover?  If not get some.  The only time changes are made it when bitching is done and I plac on doing it untill changes are made.  That guide should not of been clueless as to what happened in DL last night.  There should be a log they read before every shift like I have to at my job.  But guides and GM's jobs dont have American Lives on the line so I guess its ok to be clueless as to what happened before your shift.<br>

I however am not gonna waste my time energy nor my blood pressure trying to get any kind of customer service out of those fucking online nazi's at Sony on line (as verant is only the creative force behind this game and the people that are actually GM's are employees of Sony on Line international). And the two bubs I lost are lvl 54 exp points bro. I feel for your exp loss, but man in the greater picture, its not that much. I lost over 3 hours of exp hunting to regain the loss, and thats if I find a good group able to hold hand/warlord for any extensive amount of time. We all have bad feeling against Verant/Sony online, but it does no good getting worked up over it. those fucking nazi's won't follow thru, so cut it the fuck loose bro.<br>

Some kind of log needs to be kept.<br>

I find that some guides are good and some are just in it for the free EQ and hate it when they have to respond to a petition.  This one obviuosly was in it for the free EQ.<br>

what the fuck you want them to do .. it sounds to me like you are just bitching to be bitching .. this is a game .. its not the national security council where if you die you lose more than experience.. <br>

so what the zone crashed.. so what you lost experience .. if all you have to get worked up over is some damn experience in a game then you need to get out of the house more.. <br>

It isnt the fact that we are verant lovers. It is the fact that many of the people here you pissed off a month ago. Why have sympathy for someone that is rude, foul mouthed, opinionated, and a general pain in the ass who thinks that all of the people that went before him are all stupid morons.?<br>
<br>
Hmm other than the last point I described myself.... Hmmm. Oops.<br>
<br>
Yes it sucks. Can you do anything productive about it? No. Deal with it.<br>
<br>
As for this little gem of a quote.<br>

The guides do have a web site that posts all the important happenings.  You would think that a zone crash would have been recorded and that it would have been posted on the web site.  You would also think that the guides would read this stuff before logging on.<br>

I agree with Toein that there's not really any point in getting all worked up about it.  It's a VERY small chance that something will be done and all it does is add undue stress to you.  It's not going to make any difference to them if you get all worked up about it and start flaming them here.  It does suck and I'm sorry about your losses, but just take a deep breath and relax <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   And just think, in 2, 3, 4 months, will it really matter any more?  Whoa, I sound like some freaky counselor or something.  Sorry everyone, I'll shut up now <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
It's VERY clearly stated in the reimbursement policy that they do not reimburse experience, even if it's the game's fault that you lost exp, beyond a res.  <br>
<br>
So you see, it really doesn't matter if you are in the right, they will hammer you with their pre stated policy and it will just make you more and more mad, over what is really not a big deal(besides the principal of course).<br>
<br>
best just to suck it up.<br>
