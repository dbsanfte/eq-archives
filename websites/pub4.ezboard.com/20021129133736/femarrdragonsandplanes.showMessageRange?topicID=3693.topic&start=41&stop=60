The second passage in question seemed as though it was in mockery of Medion's orginal post...which had already stated that it wasn't aimed at ALL uber guild members. Thanks for clarifying though..I'm sure the poster could answer for himself though if so inclined. =o)<br>
<br>
Personally I disagree w/ Medion....I think you find alot more non guilded folks running around Norrath acting like fools and &quot;KSing&quot; people's camps. In fact for he who asked for examples I offer you this:<br>
<br>
Create yourself a lowbie Dark Elf or Human and when your level is right..head over to Orc 1 in EC and camp it for a bit. I'm sure you'll find alot of people pharming DF belts who like to run in and clear the camp for ya w/out asking. .oO(Especially IKS Monks &gt;&lt;)<br>
<br>
I dunno who said it..but they are correct a &quot;camp check&quot; is nothing more than a &quot;courtesy&quot;...but then again..so is slowing down a bit to let that @#%$, who thinks he can merge onto a freeway that is traveling 65-70 miles at 50 miles an hour, onto the freeway. Does Mr. Rogers look at you like an @#%$ if you don't let him over and he ends up driving right back through down the off ramp because of you? Of course. Camp checks may not be required..but I think the majority of folks would agree....if you call them it sure makes things a hell of alot easier.<br>

Cass said,<br>
&quot;I do feel, however, there are not enough posts on some of the wonderful and selfless acts that some of über guild members display. A *few* guilds are very consistent with courteous and upright behavior...&quot;<br>
<br>
I couldn't agree more. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
I'd like to take this opportunity to thank the three uber people (2 from MF, don't remember the guild of the 3rd person) who showed such generosity to myself and some of my CBA family in OS a short time ago.<br>
<br>
Thank you Popplo, Xanagg, and Baxtin!<br>
(btw, this was an unanswered camp check incident that had a very happy ending. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  )<br>

<br>
We didnt even attempt to KS, we didnt attack a single mob that you beat us to, you however felt the need to act differently.  Sour grapes? Nah, we had a good time despite your bullshit.<br>
<fontcolor=yellow><br>
5. As I am loggin in cleric, Syldra asks my tank if I want res.<br>
<br>
6. I accept res and switch back ta Canni ta find the group that has so kindly ressed me back taking the camp.<br>
<br>
7. I tell Syldra I am camping there, to which she replies that her group are now taking camp.</font><br>
<br>
Ok now here's what I find is funny... you never answered me from my tell, you spoke to my group's monk and he informed me you were ready to be ressed.  I ressed, you came back and said NOTHING... next thing we knew you were pulling the mobs from our camp... I said in say "your welcome for res btw" because I was astounded that you 1. didnt have the nerve to say so much as "thanks" but yet you started hacking at the camp that we were at.<br>
<br>
You send me a tell explaining why you didnt say thank you... and you come across as a well, I'll be nice... anyway... we talk, I say that we'd be more than happy to share the camp and I smile because I dont feel like arguing and I know damn well that my group was in the right and you were in the wrong.<br>

I wasn't there but I thank you for rezzing a guildie of mine that you came across in your travels.  With him changing chars and two-fisting I understand it's easy to miss tells and other talk.  With the way a lot of people are acting lately, he was probably trying to decide what was going on when he got back and saw a group sitting there and forogt his manners.  Again, I'll give my thanks for your help.<br>
<br>
Canni, We all know you're not an ass and I'm sure this got out of hand because of a misunderstanding.  With the amount of pricks running around nowadays, I jump the gun some myself.  One or the other of you probably got your feathers ruffled and then the other did.  I dont know which was first and dont really care.  You've posted your view, Slydra did the same.  We've all had a case of camp disagreement after a wipe.  Let's just let is go at that.<br>

I am a 59 cleric and see this alot. I run up on a fully clothed corpse and send that person a tell asking if they need a res. They reply with something like "sure". I click them and after they loot they either run off or sit down till res effects wear off. I am amazed at how many times this happens and the person can't mutter a simple "thanks or thank you". I am just curious as to what his explanation was for not saying Thank you for the res.<br>
<br>
P.S I will have to admit that 90% of the time the person says "thank you" but its sad that the other 10% are the ones that stick out in your mind. <p>Caelie<BR>

<br>
As far as why he didnt say thank you, there was actually very little "conversation" between him and I and him and my group.<br>
<br>
After res I healed him and he pulled the named from our camp, the group I was with kinda went "dude, is he taking over our camp?" and we were pretty confused... so I say (in say) "you're welcome for the res by the way"<br>
<br>
A few moments pass and group members talk about why they hate unappreciative dicks and why this guy is a prime example of why they should never go out of their way to be kind to someone... <br>
<br>
Then I get a tell from Canni ...(these are exact quotes, wording/punctuation not altered from screenshots)<br>
<br>
I will thank ya fer res, but not fer trying ta take camp after.  Canni woz offline as I woz loggin in a cleric that is parked here...<br>
<br>
I reply...<br>
<br>
we were here and got wiped, recovered came back and offered drag res... it would have been one thing to have <br>
atleast said something.<br>
he was dead, afk, you were not here, we got here, imho its not your camp anymore.<br>
<br>
He replies...<br>
<br>
He woz not afk, coz he is me... as I said I woz loggin a cleric that is sat rite here, and if ya hadn't offered cleric wouldda been here before ya even pulled.<br>
<br>
I reply...<br>
<br>
whatever, we'll split camp them :)<br>
<br>
I then inform the group we're splitting camp and we do just that.  We make sure not to attack any mobs he attacks first and we go on fighting mostly frogs from outside.  When trying to get the mobs from this camp we were generally blocked out by the 2 very large characters so I said (in say) "could you please not block the doorway" and he stopped... it wasnt until I was sitting at the back of the camp HOPING to atleast get ONE mob from the camp when he sent another tell suggesting he would find me mobs and telling me to be careful, when I asked what I was supposed to be careful of he said I was going to be sunburnt... at this point all I did in response was /report /petition... then we left.  <br>
<br>
He was by far not the "nicest" person when it came to the whole situation.  Had he said anything to the group about him wanting his camp back he'd have had it.  Instead he decided to just go on by trying to KS and swing his balls around to show he was bigger than us... that's cool though, Im sure thats perfectly fine god forbid he ever do anything wrong.  <br>
<br>
If his justification for being a dick was that he had his own cleric and if we wouldnt have ressed he'd have been there before us then he should have never taken the res from me.<br>
<br>
Just my opinion. <p><a href="http://www.19wheels.com"><img src="http://www.19wheels.com/images/circle_19-2.gif">

I hope this wasn't directed at me since I said nothing of the sort.  I'm afraid it was since I was the only one to talk about you and Canni after you posted (I believe).  If you are keeping an attitude about this, I believe you are directing it at the wrong person.  As before, I offer an apology that this happened with one of our members and thank you again for rezzing him.  I'll discuss it with him when I see him online and if you have further issue with it, feel free to send me a tell IG. <p><a href="http://members.aol.com/wvvetteman/images/dalonhorse1.jpg" target="_blank">

Ummm what's that mean?? Sorry, you know us old folk don't know much about all that new fangled slang going on. *gums her lips* <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
And no offense Dalamarn as I don't know you, nor Canni and despite the fact I do know Syldra I am in no way taking sides (she's a big girl after all and very capable of taking care of herself) seeing I wasn't involved in the incident. BUT from an outsiders unbiased POV you <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> did</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> make it seem as if Canni couldn't <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> possibly</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> have done something out of malice. Granted you were offering an apology on behalf of your guild, and Canni seeing he is a member, but when you make it out like the person your defending could never do any wrong it leaves it an empty apology. Let me show you where, in case you don't see it...<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> I wasn't there but I thank you for rezzing a guildie of mine that you came across in your travels. With him changing chars and two-fisting I understand it's easy to miss tells and other talk. With the way a lot of people are acting lately, he was probably trying to decide what was going on when he got back and saw a group sitting there and forogt his manners.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Here your thanking Syldra FOR Canni, of which if he meant to thank her he should do so himself, and despite changing chars and double-fisting making you miss tells he did NOT miss the rez and still should have shown some gratitude for that. I have double-fisted chars before myself and have always made it a point of scrolling up to see what tells I might have missed on each char. I'm also no angel and there are people IG that I don't care for in the least but when circumstances have arisen where I was rezzed by someone I didn't care for I <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> STILL</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> said thank you after being rezzed and spoke civilly to them!!!<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Canni, We all know you're not an ass and I'm sure this got out of hand because of a misunderstanding. With the amount of pricks running around nowadays, I jump the gun some myself. One or the other of you probably got your feathers ruffled and then the other did.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
This is where you make it seem as if Canni has no malicious bone in his body. As I said, I don't know him nor you from Adam, and he may very well be a generally nice person but no-one is exempt from having a malicious moment or having the capability of being an arse. Even if he DID &quot;jump the gun&quot; as you say, they were all there long enough for the problem to have been resolved right there (ie splitting the camp and killing side by side for more than 5 minutes I would gather). Yet it wasn't.<br>
<br>
He says that Syldra's group tried KSing him and she said her group never touched any of his mobs but that he was KSing most/all of theirs. THAT is a he said/she said ordeal and unless you were there, have irrefutable proof, or an outside witness should be left alone. <br>
<br>
We also have no idea what Canni's ideal of KSing is.. Is it when someone pulls a mob in &quot;your camp&quot; and kills it? Is it engaging a mob you've already engaged attempting to take the kill? Is it both? Is it none of the above but something else altogether? I can see a misunderstanding happening there.<br>
<br>
At any rate as I said above, no-one is exempt from being a dick even if they're not a dick in general. It's the blatant inconciderate demeanor he chose to treat the rez he was given that rubs me the wrong way. Ok, so he had his Cleric logging on to do his own rez. She STILL saved him the hassle of having to bother with that thereby saving him the time it would have took to get his Shammy logged out, the Cleric logged in, rezzing himself and healing himself (maybe even medding some mana back afterward?), logging the Cleric back out and then finally logging his shammy back in. <p><div align=center><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=343243"><img src="http://www.ulujain.org/albums/album04/abe.jpg" border=0></a><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=351766"><img src="http://www.ulujain.org/albums/album04/abf.jpg" border=0></a><br><a href="mailto:alethia_tamire@yahoo.com"><font size=-2>EMAIL</a></font></div></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ujexielia.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Jexielia</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_magentaspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 1045<br> <font color=#E9D756>(10/3/02 9:12:00 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3693.topic&index=58>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Said the Wal-Mart Greeter to the uber guilds...</span><hr size=1> Well now with the board back up I'd just like to take a second to share a few things...<br>
<br>
1. I apologize for bringing up the events of that evening and making it into a @#%$ fest, it was not my intentions, I was using an example and had no intentions of posting a name.  The situation just went along well with what the original post was trying to say. (yeah I know, dont start on me).  I always thought Canni was a great guy and had never expected such behavior which is probably why his attitude and behavior pissed me off so much.  Im sure he's probably not a bad guy, we all have our moments... I have had mine.<br>
<br>
Its not a big deal to me.<br>
<br>
2. I take great pride in how I play my characters in game.  Despite my attitude, straight-forwardness, and the bi<b></b>tch-ness that I have on this board... I am a very kind, generous, polite, giving, fair person in game.  I go out of my way to help people in trouble and in general.  I have rarely had conflicts in game when it comes down to it.  Im not a mean/vendictive person and though there are misunderstandings I rarely hold anyone's actions against them because it is... a game.  I have fun the way that I choose to have fun.  If something I do upsets someone... I do my best to remedy it because its not my place to make someone else's game any less enjoyable than it is for me.<br>
<br>
3. I dont play enough to make enemies over bullshit like this, but if someone's going to shun me because of it, hey thats your thing, not my loss.  My recollection of what happened that evening are not exagerated or falsified, however, even though I was bothered by his method of dealing with the situation Im sure that I could have, as well, dealt with it differently.<br>
<br>
Anyway, Im tired and going to bed now... night guys. <p><a href="http://www.19wheels.com"><img src="http://www.19wheels.com/images/circle_19-2.gif">
