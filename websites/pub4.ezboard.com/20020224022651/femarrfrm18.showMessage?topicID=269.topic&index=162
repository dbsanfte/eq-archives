<br>
No, actually I saw the bait and instead of saying something like "I know you didn't name me but there really isn't anyone else in this thread to which it applies" I turned it around and baited you waiting for you to say something as stupid as "I didn’t name you."<br>
<br>
How amateur, but I assure you I saw it. You are right, you didn’t name me but I read through the posts... so tell me, whom were you talking about? <br>
<br>
I neither have a large ego or any guilt at all, but thanks for playing.  Be more creative next time so I don't see it coming.<br>
<br>
Oh, and yes, I do feel VERY good to be one of the few who gets into heaven.  Its like God wrote us all million-dollar checks and I am one of the few to sign my name on the back.  Real proud of myself, doing the equivalent of signing my name.  Yeah.. That sure earned it, of course I am amazing.<br>
/sarcasm off.<br>
<br>
Its funny because with few exceptions your messages have all been condescending and challenging.  Not challenging mentally but slap you with a glove meet me in the street challenging.  Why are you so judgemental about me responding in kind?  Because its unchristian?  Read your Bible, even Jesus was sarcastic.  Sorry to say my time is not devoted to proving Lurikeen wrong, not to proving God right (cause He just is), but trying to spread the truth.  <br>
<br>
I don't know if I hit a nerve slowly through post after post, or if your true colors just started showing.  Either way, sexual jokes including Jesus are the epitome of disrespect not to mention very uncreative.<br>
<br>
You obviously don't even read whole posts, just skim and fill in the rest with what you think they posted.  Where did I ever even hint that I would glad to see ANYONE in hell?  There is no one that cannot repent.  I would remind you that the Apostle Paul once killed Christians before he was one, but then you would just make sexual jokes about him too, so never mind.<br>
<br>
<font color=yellow>Makes you feel like a real man, all superior and worth something. ROFL </font color><br>
<br>
Wow, ROFL?  That’s some pretty serious self gratification.  Who needs people when you find yourself so amazingly funny?<br>
<br>
<font color=yellow>Woohoo! Seems I hit a nerve with you Cendan. </font color><br>
<br>
So, that’s your goal?  Thought we were having a discussion here.  I gave up on intelligent conversation with you a long time ago... but thought the goal was still discussion.<br>

The Bible has been trasnlated into almost every language in the world and is the best seller every year.  A person can read their Bible, do what is says, and make it to heaven.  No interpretation needed.  The problem comes when falst teachers come in and confuse people.<br>

(The first can apply to other religions.)<br>
<br>
I heard about a car wreck where a whole family crashed.  All the children died (I think 4 or 5 of them).  Later while interviewing the father, he says &quot;I just want to thank God for looking after me.&quot;  It baffled me that he thanks God for saving him after everyone died.  If he thinks God saved him, who is then responsible for the crash?  It just looks like rose colored glasses to me.<br>
<br>
After I had cancer and was able to remove it, people would say to me &quot;God was with you and saved you.&quot;  I would reply (to the people that knew I was atheist) &quot;Yeah, but since he gave me cancer, I call it even.&quot;<br>
<br>
I also wondered why more Christians are not attracted to the Latter Day Saints.  They have the latest scriptures.  The New New Testament after Jesus came to America after the resurrection.  It seems that this testament has just as much proof as the original new testaments, yet people are more skeptical.  Maybe it is just people don't want to investigate other religions when they feel their current religion meets their needs.<br>
<br>
The &quot;God exists out of time&quot; has always bothered me.  If he is outside of time then he should know all that happens and have perfect prophesy (besides where he modifies the world.)  So when he makes the angels, he knows he is making some that will rebel against him.  There is no free will in others if you know what will happen based on what you do.<br>
<br>
I have also had problems accepting &quot;blind faith&quot; arguments.  That is where you just accept something without any higher reasoning or proof.  With &quot;blind faith&quot; you should worship David Kereish or the bum on the street saying he is the second coming.<br>
<br>
My grandmother keeps trying to convert me.  One of my responses is &quot;You say you know Jesus is real.  I have a friend that says she saw Diana (one of the Greek goddesses) and knows she is real.  I have people tell me if I worship the wrong version of Jesus I go to hell.  Most religion say they are right and all others are wrong.  (Luckily not all religions do this.)  So there is no way to choose one religion over the other since they are all based on belief in something that cannot be proven true.&quot;  But that never phases her.  She just says she <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> knows</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Jesus is real and that should be enough.<br>
<br>
Well, enough ramblings.  Religious discussions can be enlightening.  Too often they just fall into insults or immature actions.<br>

Hmmm... ever read the &quot;Tell Tale Heart&quot; by Edgar Allan Poe? You certaintly are one paranoid fellow. Perhaps it is guilt over all the judging you have been doing? Maybe the worry you are incorrect about your interpretation of scripture? You seem rather insecure, Cendan. Yes, I have done a flame or two, but if you go through this thread and count up all the posts that I have written then compare how many are flames (or your &quot;street challenging&quot;) versus thought out presentations of fact, I think you will find you are wrong. However, given that you are weighted with guilt over all the statements of condemnation you have made here I think even the least offensive statement I could make would look like a flaming attack to you. I suppose you should get over yourself and seek the forgiveness of those humans you have harshly judged. Until then that Heart will just keep beating under the planks, giving you away with every word you speak or write.<br>

Frankly Cendan you couldn't hold an &quot;intelligent conversation&quot; with anyone here if your eternal soul depended on it! You think that the biblical rote you spew on these boards even resembles intelligent dialogue? Any trained Parrot can quote scripture. It takes intelligence to do careful exegesis and you certaintly have not demonstrated here that you know much of anything about scholarly biblical interpretation.

<br>
Um, no attempt at recovery.  I saw right through your lame attempt.  On the off chance that you didn't intend to bait, then you are incredibly predictable.  Either way I was waiting for the exact response I got.  If I had predicted your response you would have said "I wasn't going to say that." But, whatever, it isn't worth discussing cause you will just lie to make a point.<br>
<br>
<font color=yellow>That statement is a little gem, Cendan. I like the "Oh, you weren't talking about me, so who were you talking about then?" bit. Yup, your EGO is rather large.

I know, you would like to think the post was put there just to bait you, but it wasn't..</font color><br>
<br>
Let me help you here, remember saying this:<br>
<br>
<font color=yellow>Interestingly enough haven't we seen some of that <b>in this thread? </b>Haven't we read comments from those who claim to be devout followers of Christ, but who lack a high regard for people in general and even fellow Christians?</font color><br>
<br>
Notice the bolded "in this thread"?  So, after reading through this thread again I ask who were you talking about?  Despite the fact that you misenterprit and misjudge me there isn't anyone else who would fit your statement.<br>
<br>
Paranoia?  I am not familiar with the clinical definition.  Does a paranoid individual have to care if a half wit is out to get them?  Its purely rhetoric since regardless of the answer, I just don't care what you think.<br>
<br>
Guilt?  Well thats another poor assumption since I have done nothing wrong here.  Not to mention I am a saved christian so guilt isn't even an issue.  Jesus takes care of all that for me, but I appreciate the concern on your part.<br>
<br>
I believe I used english when I stated that only God condemns people.  I don't tell people they are going to hell, I tell them if they don't listen to God they are.  Its plain, its simple, and yet you still can't follow me.<br>
<br>
Apparently you are one of those people who won't accept God because that means there is something out there smarter than you, a category which quite a few species actually fall into.  It also gives you a feeling of no control in your life.  Sorry you feel that way.<br>
<br>
<font color=yellow>Heheheh, truth be told I wasn't thinking of "getting it on" in a sexual sense and never meant it that way. However, many a sexual joke about Jesus can be very funny and creative. Such as, do you know why Jesus calls the gates in Heaven the "Pearly Gates"? I will let you figure out the punchline, Cendan.</font color><br>
<br>
Um.. yeah.. cause I have seen "getting it on" used in so many other ways.  Regardless its pretty hypocritical to call me disrespectful and then tell jokes about Jesus which will no doubt offend me (although He doesnt need my defense) and others.<br>
<br>
<font color=yellow>Cendan, your posts dealing with salvation betray your obvious glee in sending people to hell. Sure, you don't see it that way, but I will wager I am not the only person on this board who sees you take pleasure in pointing out how people are not saved (which means they are going to hell).</font color><br>
<br>
Not only are you a poor judge of character but you also assume that others on the board are as ignorant?  If I was glad people were lost I would shut up and laugh at them under my breath.  As a person you aren't worth sharing the gospel with but as a soul you are.  Regardless of how someone (including but not limited to you) treats me, their soul still matters.<br>
<br>
<font color=yellow>Frankly Cendan you couldn't hold an "intelligent conversation" with anyone here if your eternal soul depended on it! You think that the biblical rote you spew on these boards even resembles intelligent dialogue? Any trained Parrot can quote scripture. It takes intelligence to do careful exegesis and you certaintly have not demonstrated here that you know much of anything about scholarly biblical interpretation. Rather, I asked you pointed questions theologians have grapled with for hundreds of years and you said they were "trite". Shows how much you really know (not much).</font color><br>
<br>
Personally I am not at all worried about keeping up in what you consider an intelligent conversation.  Like I stated, it is not an easy thing to change the Bible and have no one notice.  I assume that you have directly translated scroll fragments yourself and found inconsistencies?<br>
<br>
The trite comment was also refering to your questions which you no doubt view as some kind of huge problem for Christians, when in reality it is a small thing.  So tell me what you know that discredits all the scroll fragments that have been found.  You obviously are an expert on the subject.<br>
<br>
<font color=yellow>Cendan, I wasn't emoting a laugh about what I had written. I emoted a laugh about you. I was laughing at you. Can you grasp that?</font color><br>
<br>
Oh, nice recovery, except that still leaves you in a position to not be laughing at others.  You laughing at others is like a clown in full dress making fun of a woman for wearing white shoes after Labor Day.  That's okay though, cause like I said... enjoy this short life as much as you can.  If laughing at others makes you feel better about yourself then by all means have at it.<br>

     From what I have read of your posts there seems to be a problem with the path to heavan you decribe. It all seems as if some mathematical formula was pulled out of The Bible. Do X and Y and get to Heavan. kinda dry and boring if ya ask me. Not to metion it leaves out, in my opinion, the most important things in any religion, spiritualism &amp; faith. Without these the formula really does not mean anything. One cannot force oneself to feel these things just to fit a formula. A true sense of faith and a spiritual connection with God is something that is truly necessary. Having just the frmula does not work. I think much of what is in the Bible is less commandment and more guidline to help one to aquire a state of faith and spirituality.<br>

<br>
Cendan, just an FYI. Long ago, I studied Koine Greek (translated parts of the New Testamament from Greek to English), hermeneutics, and various courses in apologetics. I am not an expert, but have a solid understanding of Biblical translation, interpretation, and the various issues involved.<br>
<br>
It really doesn't surprise me that a Fundy such as yourself can misidentify critical issues relevant to the dogma you pound. What is a bit surprising is how much at ease you are with down playing any issue raised to you no matter how it is presented.<br>
<br>
Any way, I am going to leave this as my last set of comments to you. I am truly sorry I engaged in small flame fest with you. I want to apologize to you for flaming you.<br>

I was speaking in a broader sense. Look at it this way. If you go through the motions of baking a cake and do it to a precise formula and the formula is a good one you will most likley get a good cake. Someone who is excellent at baking and uses the formula as only a guideline can and most likely will make a better cake. This is where art trancends science just like spirituality and faith trancend commandments. The commandments are a guidline to get you to the where you should be in a spiritual and faithful sense. Things that help you along you journey to build your relationship with God. I doubt very seriouly the ommision of one act will condemn you to hell. I bet Heaven is packed with people who were never baptised. Why? Because they had Faith.<br>

I bring this up again because I want you to actually put yourself into the situation and not just say &quot;ofcourse they will not be saved&quot;<br>
<br>
If <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> you</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> were someone who was born into a part of the world that never heard of the Bible or any of &quot;God's ways&quot; such as baptism.  You lived your whole life as a good person, because that's what you thought was right; but you never went to church or were baptized, there was no such thing.<br>
<br>
So now, you die and are sent to hell.  You then learn of this God that sent you there (atleast indirectly).<br>
<br>
What would you think of this God?  Wouldn't you think this is completely unfair to be judged on something you were never told?  Wouldn't you think God was evil?  Infact, wouldn't God <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> be</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> evil?<br>
<br>
Think of this from that perspective.

Faith is important but you can not faith your way into heaven.  Even Satan has faith in God.<br>
<br>
There is not a single un baptised person in heaven.  Not one.  If there is then God is a liar, and that He can not be.<br>
<br>
If you believe otherwise then you are not going by the Bible and therefor it is pointless for us to discuss God/heaven, because you are obviously talking about a different god/heaven. <p><table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" height="1">

<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Problem with that is that my opinion of God does not change what He is.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Maybe you should instead look again to see if you truely know what He is.  You claim you do, yet I have just showed and you agreed He treats people unfair in your picture.<br>

You would think the ultimate supreme being would be able to distinguish between people better than this, wouldn't you?<br>

<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
But the exact example I gave you is a case where you had every single right to THINK you were respecting His word, and following His word in every way possible- but something out of your control happened that you were never aware of. (in this case, not being baptized correctly)  So, you respected His word to the <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>best of your ability</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> (which is all we can do right, since God has bestowed upon each one of us everything we are?)- and he treated you unfairly because of a &quot;technicality&quot; beyond your control.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>This is a simple logical deductive argument</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END-->:  It is clear that in actuality God does not treat people unfairly. If he did, then all discussions about God would be completely irrelivent.  Your version of God is He is strict to the letter on actions, even when the &quot;thought&quot; and &quot;faith&quot; is in the right place. (i.e. being baptized a different way)  Since being strict to the letter has shown to have the possiblity of yeilding unfair treatment and God cannot be unfair- your idea of God is flawed.<br>
<br>
I know that it is not so black and white and God would never judge thus so.

Tuan, you just may as well give up talking with the likes of Cendan. They are not reachable. You can reason with them, flame them, do whatever, and they are unyielding. Such people have lost all reason. They wear blinders as a protective measure. They are trying to shield their frail lives with a very calculating black and white world. They can't see just how brittle their lives are; ready to break under stress at a moment.<br>
<br>
I have met people in RL just like what Cendan protrays here. The people I met were very frightened of themselves. If the world was not &quot;cut and dry&quot;, if God's declarations were not crisp and clear, they fell apart and fed into their dark sides.<br>
<br>
I realized after my small flame fest with Cendan that I can't really blame him for what he is. I can respect the fact that his strength flows through the negativity of legalism. He has lived with it long enough now that he doesn't even notice the negative impact on others who don't follow his brand of Christianity. However, that is all that keeps him psychologically sound for the time being.<br>
<br>
Maybe someday Cendan will get to see the various colors in life. It will not be just black and white. Maybe, given time and experience, he will see the beauty in people. <br>
<br>
Well, the best we can do is hope for ourselves and not get trapped into legalism. As an atheist I am trying to keep an open mind. I understand that I could very well be wrong. Indeed, I at times hope that I am. I think reincarnation would be wonderful. Going to &quot;Heaven&quot; might even be great with the right deity.<br>
<br>
Cendan, I am not trying to bash you more. I sincerely apologize for flaming you earlier. I am sincere in my remarks above. I realized once I had made my last posting you are probably a person who is just in need of a lot of love and understanding. Nothing wrong with that. We all need love and understanding. We all need it more at times than others. But I can tell you from experience that drawing hard lines will only chase away people. Sure you can believe it, but you don't have to wield your beliefs like a sword. You only find people like me who will oblige and cut back. That makes life even more stressful and hurtfull. You get into a viscious circle and become even more legalistic, black and white, and cut off so many people. One day, you look upon your life with no friends, no family, and wonder why God can't give you a little heaven on earth. Just my thoughts bro, take care.<br>

<br>
Like I said, you either believe in God and follow His word, or you don't believe in him.  Now, I am not going to make assumptions so please tell me what category you fall into.<br>
<br>
You sound as if you accept God but only on your terms, and that just doesn't work.  Are you athiest or a believer?<br>
<br>
Just so you know that I am not avoiding the question I will remind you that the Apostle Paul when he was Saul was a devout folloewr of God.  He killed Christians thinking they were blasphemers, thinking he was a perfect Jew.  Jesus came to him and educated him in a rather scary way.  Paul, formerly Saul, was not a Christian with the Holy Spirit until he was baptised.<br>
<br>
<br>
Lurikeen,<br>
<br>
You said you had nothing more to say to me, which is where you should leave it.  You say you apologize and then try to paint a picture of me as some loser with no love.<br>
<br>
You can't imagine how wonderful my wife is, you just can't.  You can't imagine how dependable and loving my parents have been.  You wouldn't understand that I have a great relationship with my wife's parents, and all her friends.  You might be surprised that I am friends with all my ex girlfriends, and my wife has met and hung out with several.  My wife and I have eaten at the parents house of an ex, while the ex was off at college.  I assure you I have all the relationships I need.  I am very loved, too loved if you ask me, cause I am a slip through the cracks kind of guy when I can get away with it.<br>
<br>
I dont appreciate your snide remarks hidden in the guise of sympathy.  Keep your sympathy, apparently you are the only one who thinks I need it.<br>
<br>
Now I can understand you saying I wear blinders because I won't convert to your Athiesm.  Because I say that some issues are black and white you state that my life is.  Come on now, don't stoop.<br>
<br>
I am a stressed fragile person right.  Ask anyone who knows me in game, ask anyone who knows me in life, ask anyone who I vacationed with that I met from in game.  You can't get me down, I am very stable and very secure.  I am aware of my strengths and my weaknesses.  I am not frightened of myself.<br>
<br>
My strength flows through the negativity of legalism.  Um, okay.  I am happy to be saved and trying to spread the good news to others but I am a negative person.  Yup, thats me.<br>
<br>
Which is it?  Do I have on blinders in happy ignorance or do I see things and live in this dark world of doubt?  As far as my impact on others who hear me... believe the Bible discusses the popularity of the message.  So you think I should water it down like most people do?  Try to make it more acceptable and convienient?  I would rather be a zealot then a sell out.<br>
<br>
Me see the beauty in people?  You won't find many people who spend more time helping others.  I wont mention names and embarass anyone but lots of people in game have told me their troubles and I have listened, and given advice.  I never mentioned the Bible once, I think its out of line to push that on people in game.  I reply to theads on the subject here, but I see nothing wrong with that.  I have even got private messages asking for prayers.  Its a pity you choose to see me as some legalistic person with no love.<br>
<br>
Dont be an ass and talk to me by talking about me.  Either talk to me or move on like you said you were.<br>
<br>
I hope you don't consider yourself an amateur psychologist, because you couldn't read me if you had my personal journal memorized.<br>
<br>
You claim to be some educated exegetical wonder.  If you apply the same skill to what I write as you did to your Koine Greek then you might want to go back over it.<br>
<br>
I apologize for any assumptions I made about you.  I do respect your intelligence but you really need work on your people skills.  You have spent almost every post assuming things about me that aren't even close, and stating them as if they are fact. <p><table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" height="1">

I decided to go ahead and address you directly with my sincere thoughts. But, being the rabid jerk you are you decided to even flame me there.<br>
<br>
You should also note that in my posting I qualified my remarks with "I have met people in RL just like what Cendan protrays here." I wonder what part of "portray" you didn't understand? You certainly have every right to challenge the way you are percieved. Some people actually write things like "I am sorry if I come across that way..." or "I apologize". Of course, you have probably never mouthed such phrases let alone try to write them.<br>
<br>
At any rate you fuck tard. I recant any apology I sincerely made to your stupid ass. You aren't worthy of worm shit. Do the world a favor and arrange to meet your Lord ASAP. I am only happy that rigid nutless wonders like yourself are few a far between.<br>
<br>
/rude<br>
<br>
BTW, the reason why the Gates in Heaven are called the "Pearly Gates" is because of all the giz Jesus spews out as people such his cock to get into heaven. They don't call them the "Pearly Gates" for nothing.<br>

<br>
I have no problem apologizing at all.  Fact is, though, that I am not sorry I came across that way, because I did not come across that way, you looked for it... and not finding it you invented it.<br>
<br>
If I was you I would stick to pretending God doesn't exist rather than making Him the subject of your jokes.  I can't think of any thing He hates more than blasphemy.<br>
<br>
The problem is that you are smart.  You aren't stupid.  If you were stupid I would have let your comments pass and accepted your backwards apology.  You knew very well what you were doing.<br>
<br>
Just curious, using your reasoning is "you are acting like an ass" not an insult because its better than "you are an ass"?<br>
<br>
Regardless, I apologize for responding in kind, and for letting you upset me.  I could have found a more constructive way to defend myself.  Its isn't just the way that you made me look, its the fact that you made it seem like that image was a product of a Godly life.<br>
<br>
I also apologize that I let the tone of my responses be influenced by the fact that lots of what you said and asked is typical.  The same questions asked over and over get on anybody's nerves.  The same statements that tend to be sterotypical also tend to get on my nervers.  Things like "Christians are weakminded" or "Christians have blinders on" are easy to provoke anger.  One that makes me more angry than anything is the accusation that Christians enjoy condemning people.  <br>
<br>
In all honesty true Christians, on average, have done more research than most religious people because at first they would love to find loop-holes to such a strict requirement.  Plus, given the requirements, they look to find a way that their friends, co-workers, and even some family could be saved despite what the Bible says.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I have no right to be angry at you for a typical response when all you were giving was a natural response.  Not your fault that people before you have given the same stereotypical response.  Don't know if I am being clear here or not, tried several times to make the wording better... oh well.<br>
<br>
I have a lot of faults, but sincerity isn't one of them.  If I misjudged your intentions then I do truly apologize.  I just don't see any other way you could have meant things you said. <p><table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" height="1">

I think where you come across wrong to other folks is you actually think you know what God is oging to do, what He is thinking, what makes Him angry, and how He is supposed to be reached. Sorry, you don't. No one does. In Christain writings we are shown a path to reach our relationship with God. Note, I said PATH not connect the dots. this path was written by people searching for spirituality, faith and a realtionship with God. It records the words fo the Son of God. Men can fail, and thus these writings are not perfect, not to be taken as the ONLY way to reach God. I would submit that they should be taken as a GUIDE to achieve a realtionship with God to help build your faith in God.<br>
<br>
Your veiwpoints are rigid and unyielding and based upon an ultimaley good but, through man, flawed source.<br>
