What do I think of it?  I think Mythic has definitely given us something great!  I play an Hibernian Mentalist on Gawaine, currently level 19, and I'm having a freakin' blast.  It's like playing a cleric and an enchanter at the same time in a group (crowd control + heals), and because I keep my light magic and mentalism both at 2/3rd my level, I have reliable DD as well.<br>
<br>
I'm giving thought to checking out EQ again when SoL comes out, but quite frankly, I'm having so much fun with DAoC right now, I have a hard time seeing myself playing EQ ever again.<br>
<br>
I think one of the main things Mythic is doing right is communicating well with the players and actually utilizing their input positively and implementing changes quite expediently.  It's giving the game more of a &quot;for the players&quot; feel vs. the EQ &quot;players vs. VI&quot; feel.  I've read a lot about the upcoming additions to DAoC, and I must say, I'm impressed.<br>
<br>
I think DAoC will not only continue to do well but will gather an even larger player base in the near future.<br>
<br>
Will it kill EQ?  Nah...look at UO, people still play that game.  It's hard to give up something you've invested so much of your time into, even when you grow tired of it.  Although I'm not currently subscribed to EQ, I'd have a hard time deleting my characters on an account with a 60 monk, 52 mage, 51 druid and several hundred thousand plats worth of equipment.<br>
<br>
I am curious about something though.  I wonder how many subscriptions Verant has lost lately.<br>

I'll admit that I skim them, but as soon as I see a reference to Da`kor or any member of their guild...I hit the scroll on my mouse very fucking fast.<br>
<br>
You talk about not having a grudge against Da`kor anymore, guess it's just evolved to every player of the guild...not the guild itself.  Lord knows I've had my problems with their guild, alot of us in MS have had to constantly butt heads with them at one time or another.  Just give it a break, none of us care..and 99% of us would love to see your ass banned from this board.  I think more people would cheer at your departure than we did when Ewle got busted out.<br>
<br>
Maybe you just enjoy the attention, I don't know and I don't really care.  I just wonder how many people telling you that you have serious mental problems, and that you should seek professional help or just end it all with a 45 to your head before you'll listen.<br>
<br>
Anyway, as far as DAoC's lifespan.  Who knows.  From what I saw during beta 4 it was a fairly promising game...I played a few classes past level 5 to get the feel for the specialization(I must say the hide/sneak graphics on the character look damn good) and my favorites were definitely shadowblade, eldritch, and wizard.  I spread my points around instead of picking one field to dump the majority into...made the game sorta interesting since I've always found it easier to level on my own than group. <br>
<br>
Alot of the combat system things I liked.  Like how you can't really kite.  Some classes get snare/root spells..but they have a duration plus once the mob is hit by any damaging spell it automatically breaks.  You can attempt to kite(ala-root kiting methods from EQ), but you have to be facing the mob to recast on it, plus it will eventually give up chasing you if you do it for too long.<br>
<br>
Also, mobs forget.  Like that goblin fisherman that I had to use sprint to get away from won't come rushing back after me once I get so close, regardless of whether it could feasibly see me or not.  It just goes back to its spawn point, like it figures it deterred me from trying to kill it and is now going to go back about its business....that is until I attack it again <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Which in doing so, I seemed to notice that 80-90% of the time they remove a chunk of the xp you would've gotten had you just killed it straight up.  I can only assume this is because you can sit to regain your mana/hp really fast, while the mob just goes back to standing where it was before you attacked it...giving you a definite advantage.<br>
<br>
I like the different spell effects per realm.  Like certain spells might do the same basic thing as another spell owned by another class in another realm, but they would look almost totally different.  Plus how some high-level spells have graphics that are, simply put, Huge.  I remember running my avalonian sorcerer from his starting place at that academy(don't remember the name off-hand, begins with an L I believe) to camelot hills.  The run reminded me alot of trying to go from Qeynos to Freeport on foot at low levels.  (the forest I started in had shitty mob-levels..went from abundant level 1 mobs..to sparse level 3 mobs...and then jumped straight to level 7+ mobs)<br>
<br>
Along the way, after crossing the bridge a small ways before the keep, I noticed bright flashes of light that filled the small valleys of the path I was on and all the area around me.  I, being a DAoC newbie, was like &quot;Oh shit what was that?&quot;. And the theurgist I was travelling with simply told me it was the graphics from a high level spell caster nearby.<br>
<br>
That kind of shit impressed me, the awe of something so simple as a spell being cast by someone much higher level than me.  In EQ you can only marvel when you ask how much damage suchandsuch did, as all spells of the same type(regardless of level/race/class) look basically the same.  Only with a few added effects for levels..(like more glowing balls when you cast invis...or the added colors to shielding spells)<br>
<br>
Will I buy DAoC? Maybe...EQ is still alot of fun for me, which is probably garnered from the fact that I do belong to the powerful guild that I do.  I also believe that DAoC will show VI at least a little of what they should've done, and will 'force their hand' into making certain changes to keep up with the competition.(seperate chat windows for combat/etc come to mind as some of the basics)<br>
<br>
I've never wanted a pet...I've always wanted a familiar, however(along the lines of D&amp;D type fams)...so I'm quite interested in how fucked up VI will do them, or maybe that they might even get them mostly right.  If they let us name them(since they aren't exactly a pet afterall and you'll basically be summoning the same one each time) it will be an even bigger boon.  I'm going to enjoy having my drake tag along behind me. <p><center><img src=" http://home.btconnect.com/Lindzc/mage.gif"><i><b><font size="3" face="Ariel Narrow"><font color="red"><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=8859>Ramierez D`Elerian Draegonis</a></i></b></font></font><img src=" http://home.btconnect.com/Lindzc/mage.gif"><i><b><font size="2" face="Ariel Narrow"><font color="blue"><br>A Wizard's soul is forged in the crucible of magic.~~Antimodes of the White Robes.</i></b></font></font></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uramierez.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ramierez</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 226<br> <font color=#E9D756>(10/26/01 11:38:17 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=7.topic&index=110>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Attention Viewers!</span><hr size=1> Oh...and as far as hawaii...I don't think he could pass the ASVAB, let alone belong to any armed forces with something like that.

<br>
Hawaii, if you do belong to one of the armed forces, and it just happens to be the Army, and you really care about that disorder enough to prove it....I'm a 75B10...I can pull up your 201 file pretty easily.  Honestly, I don't see how they'd let you do anything but infantry if it was that pronounced and even that would be iffy...You call in fire support, but when you give your position, you invert the grid coordinates or even the map ID(in the military, the world maps are seperated into a specified size/number of grids.  Each map is given its own alpha-numeric identifier, but all use the same alpha-numerics for the grids themselves.)<br>

But the, I've been reading this board since Dec 99, so I remember a lot of old amusing flame wars. For that matter, I played on Emarr from Dec 99 until very, very recently, so I remember most of you, although for obvious reasons I rarely discussed my &quot;real life&quot; identity in game. (My original character used to group with Celdor in South Karana, back in the days when killing an avocet was a bigger rush than a plane raid, for crying out loud.) It's not a secret or anything. I distinctly recall coming here and posting something on General, asking if any guilds would like to apply for the guild beta test. A whole bunch did. /shrug<br>

My email address has been posted in a million places, anybody can write to me with feedback. It's sanya@mythicentertainment.com. No one person is any more special than anyone else. Feel free to write, although I may not be able to respond in depth, what with several hundred emails a day.<br>

Welcome to generation two, where the people who work on MMOGs have played the others. I honestly recognize most of the in-game names in this thread. I remember dropping twink loot on some of you. I trained some of you a few times, (although it wasn't on purpose and I was lost, I swear, that's my story and I'm sticking to it). I got into arguments with some of you. Some of you organized pick up plane raids that I was on. I came and pulled fire giants for some of you.<br>
<br>
My point is that knowing me isn't weird. Most of you do, even if you don't realize it. &quot;Developers&quot; are not gods, they are normal players with really cool jobs. <br>

Love and sloppy kisses,<br>

Shiteng, I don't really care if you play the game or not.  Point is, you said you had a hunter on Merlin.  You then said that didn't mean you played the game.  Thereby implying that you bought the game, logged in and created a character, immediately logged back out and never touched it again.  Well, hunters are a level five profession choice, so you had to play until at least level 5.  <br>
<br>
Either you lied about the character, or you lied about playing.  Either way, who cares?  I'm not going to speak for everyone, but I don't care.  Play daoc or don't play, just stay away from me in game.<br>
<br>
Please don't contact me in game, I don't want to put up with your endless garbage there too.   If it makes you feel better, I'll concede that it's possible you have a character on Merlin.  Caoilfhionn does not exist on Merlin, and I'm not inclined to make her just so you can prove something that meaningless.  Even if I did, I don't think you could spell it right, which kind of helps when you want to /send me.<br>
<br>
Btw, which is it.  You play or you don't play? And if you do play, why'd you choose merlin when your arch-enemy (that is so comic book) is there?  <br>
<br>
If you still feel the need to prove it to someone, choose any number of folks here, there's a couple who've indicated they'd be willing to accept the tell.<br>

<br>
The word 'Play'<br>
<br>
Some people would tell you they 'play' the stock market.<br>
To me that would be 'work'<br>
<br>
To gain experience with a character that I know will never be used <br>
is 'work' NOT 'play'<br>
<br>
I choose the words I use with care. That is delibrete.<br>
<br>
If you had wished to actually pin me down you would have been more precise.<br>
<br>
Also I didnt say I didnt play the game. I said &quot;I dont recall saying that I played<br>
DAOC at all'<br>
<br>
To me such syntax is very important. I am sorry if it throws you.<br>
<br>
Also any human can change their mind. Women do it all the time<br>
especially where courtship is involved. They usually dont consider<br>
that 'lying'.<br>
<br>
A statement made in the past can be quite true, and yet someone<br>
can in the future invalidate it.<br>
<br>
Obviously you dont care about all these subtleties but I certainly do. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm19.showMessageRange?topicID=7.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm19.showMessageRange?topicID=7.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm19.showMessageRange?topicID=7.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm19.showMessageRange?topicID=7.topic&start=61&stop=80>4</a><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm19.showMessageRange?topicID=7.topic&start=81&stop=100>5</a> <b>6</b> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm19.showMessageRange?topicID=7.topic&start=121&stop=140>7</a><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm19.showMessageRange?topicID=7.topic&start=141&stop=146>8</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm19.showPrevMessage?topicID=7.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm19.showNextMessage?topicID=7.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=7.topic&index=123><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/gfx/addReply1.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm19.emailToFriend?topicID=7.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm19.threadControl?topicID=7.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/deleteThreadFire.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm19.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=7.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm19.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=7.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub4.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="emarrmessageboardrules">Message Board Rules<option value="emarrlinks">Links<option value="emarrupcomingmmorpgs">Upcoming MMOG's<option value="emarrfrm18">America Under Attack<option value="emarrfrm19">Dark Age of Camelot<option value="emarrgeneral">General<option value="emarrfrm17">Funny Stuff<option value="emarrbazaar">Item Bazaar<option value="emarrscrollsnspells">Spell Bazaar<option value="emarrfrm15">Shiny Things<option value="emarrfrm14">Bargain Basement<option value="emarrdragonsandplanes">Rants and Flames<option value="emarrfrm13">Dragons and Planes<option value="emarrroleplaying">Roleplaying<option value="emarrroleplayingoocforum">Roleplaying - OOC Forum<option value="emarrscammeralert">Scammer Alert<option value="emarrsignaturecorner">Test Forum<option value="emarrreallife">Real Life<option value="emarrothermmorpgs">Other MMOG's</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#E9D756>- </font><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/bemarr>Erollisi Marr, The Queen of Love</a><font color=#E9D756> - </font><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm19>Dark Age of Camelot</a> <font color=#E9D756> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><form method="post" action="http://affiliates.allposters.com/link/redirect.asp" target="_top">
