I meant to say AC/HP helps in taking hits.<br>
2)I never said there is no need for skill. Someone who is absolutly horrible can work against the group even with good equipment. Reread my post. I said skill plays a role up to a certain point. Equipment plays a role up to a certain point too. Not one of them by themselves is going to do well.<br>
3)Given someone with sufficiently high level they can single pull even if it's their first time. Just shoot an arrow at one of the mobs right next to each other and only that will come unless you do something stupid. See the absolutly horrible part in #1 above. I'm considering level in the same category as equipment. It's an in-game stat that is not based on a players skill.<br>
4)Actually we're talking about equipment in general, instuments included. Many times I've used the wrong instrument for a song because that insturment had a stat on it that I needed for the success of the song more than the power of the song. Wind songs especially, most dont get a great benefit with instrument.<br>
5)How are bards good at absorbing damage now? Certainly not with Lambent. Maybe some armor with high AC?<br>
6)Good armor is not just AC. Sometimes its the stats on it that will help. Like again CHA for bards, STR for melee damage, or things like WIS for clerics.<br>
7)In a cookie cutter group, classes like ours dont need to get hit, correct, but shit still happens. The enchanter or main tank still dies, then its your turn to tank and my turn to mez. If I get an early mez break I take the hits and I need to have to equipment to survive longer than the enchanter that just died before me. Also waiting to form these perfect cookie cutter groups take too long. Many times I will not call an enchanter, because I can do it. Also I may call rangers to tank. In that case hopefully they have the equipment to do it. Again whats the ranger thats main-tank to do? Pull out and have it agro the healer? Smooth.<br>
<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> Ok bards put your weapons away. If you cant do damage like the rangers might as well do none at all. One of the basic concepts of the bard is a little bit over a longer period of time results in a lot. We dont have big nukes, or cheals, but we have dots (with which I've solo KS'd from two entire raids) and regens (which cant save someone at the last second, but can reduce the strain on the healer). Similarly, our melee may not be as strong, but as Evesong put it once, &quot;Every little bit helps.&quot;<br>
9)Yes someone with lower end equipment can adapt and still do well in a number of circumstances. However, good equipment will push the upper bound higher so you can do even better. Example: In the kitchen in Sebilis the grounp had an enchanter. He was stikilled but lacked in equipment. Poor guy died many times and eventually I was main mez for the group and the enchanter was backing ME up. This is an example of two players close to their upper bound. The one with sub-standard equipment could not cut it, though later when he returned with better stuff he had a much easier time.<br>
10)mez/charm/haste/regen/mana that about sums up a bard. Add a little bit of melee and short duration tanking and some other miscellaneous things.<br>
11)Naked bard who knows his class and l33t twink newbie are two extremes. You dont try anything serious with either of them. There is a reason you summon corpse and not always take your naked group to fight their way down (yes sometimes it can be done I dont need to be made aware of tiny exceptions)<br>
12)Look at what you have and the situation and use the the tools to make the best out of the situation. That requires skill and is important to have. Cutting down a redwood with a keyhole saw is not feasable. Likely having good equipment allows you to accomplish more, but only if your skilled and the equipment is the limiting factor.<br>
<br>
Summary: You need both skill and equipment in a good character, but you cannot denounce equipment. It does make things easier, more possible even for the most skillful or adapting player. Conditions are not always ideal, sometimes things outside your control come up where a good player with bad equipment could lose, and a good player with good equipment could survive. Good equipment pushes the upper bound so you could accomplish what used to be impossible, make the hard tasks easier, and the easy tasks trivial.<br>
<br>

<br>
I heartily agree that equipment is a large factor in how well a good player can perform his job. The point I am arguing is that while equipment will make a good player better, it will never make a bad player good. Therefore a person should not look for equipment to make up for his/her shortcomings as a player, but rather work on getting the things right that they are doing wrong. I think that is what I was trying, but failed to say in my first post.<br>
<br>
And yes, level is a huge factor in pulling singles in any dungeon, but skill is as well. After all, one is not always high enough to benifit from reduced agro. Certain classes have the ability to single pull areas where their level will not allow them to do so on its own. Those classes (which includes both bards and rangers) have the ability to do so, but to pull it off does require skill as well as knowledge of the area being pulled. So there again we have skill, and no piece of equipment will help a person pull singles.<br>
<br>
When I said bards were decent at absorbing damage, keep in mind I see it from a ranger point of view. You can wear plate armor with fairly high AC on it, get defense equivalent to warriors, and post 50 also get parry and riposte (although capped fairly low, merely having the skill goes a long way) to augment defense skills. Add to this the damage absorbtion songs available to bards, and you have a decent tank. From my ranger point of view anyway, as I see it, better you than me <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
As for bard melee, I would never ask a bard to put away a weapon and just sing. Bards have a good damage output, but it will nonetheless never be equal or close to that of a melee with double attack. But it all helps, so definitely keep it up. Also, some bard weapons look very cool, so it would really be a shame to put them away. Oh and regen... I love bard regen... both when playing my ranger and my cleric, it often does not reduce downtime, it completely removes it.<br>
<br>
And no, a ranger being main tank would not pull out <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  It works well enough, just not as well as with a warrior in most situations. I've tanked every camp in upper sebilis with my fairly low AC, and have yet to hear a cleric bitch at me. Because my AC may be low, but I tend to dodge, parry or riposte a lot of the attacks, and hence do not take so much damage overall even if I take more per individual hit. Oh yeah, and as a ranger I must admit to having some fairly decent AC buffs available to me as well hehe. I've been in a few groups where I was main tank over a warrior though. It usally had something to do with a rogue, a ragebringer, and a warrior who for the world could not keep agro on himself <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
There is still the question of stats. I doubt anyone has any solid info on this (I certainly don't), but my gut feeling is, that while they do have some effect, it is quite small. And the effect on resists usally only comes into play when fighting mobs nears your own level. So in most cases, stats are not too important. Then again, more definitely won't hurt, and as a bard I would certainly take more charisma whenever I got the chance. After all, a small difference is still a difference, but it is often also a difference that can be overcome by player skill. <br>
<br>
I've seen lower level and poorer equipped players do a kickass job in places where higher level characters have struggled. Granted, they would do even better with the appropriate gear, but they had the skills to do with what they had. I think the real key is knowing your limits, both as a character and as a group. After this comes the finesse some people have when playing that just makes them stand out in the crowd, and which for some classes (most notably bards and enchanters) can be what tips the balance in your favor in case of an ugly situation.<br>
<br>
Hmm, after reading through the posts and this reply again, I actually think we agree in a lot of areas. But it is definitely a good discussion, which I doubt will ever come to a complete close <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Looking forward to more opinions on this.<br>
<br>
