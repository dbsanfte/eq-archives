That's not what it meant.<br>

You said:<br>

When you say blacks also didn't keep people in slavery.  My response was, neither did any white people today.  Nor did many whites &quot;beat and kill&quot; blacks anymore than blacks have done to whites in recent years.<br>
<br>

That's the problem, you see it as a long time as many others do.  Why does it matter how long ago? What matters is how it is today.  So just how long is &quot;long enough&quot; until it should be let go Kanibaal? 1 generation, 2..3..5?<br>
<br>
To coninue on about some black people choosing to hold onto the wounds.  Some sure do.  To be general, anytime someone uses the excuse of like &quot;my people have been opressed for hundreds of years so I deserve this&quot; to try to get something free today, that is holding on to an open wound for benefit.<br>
<br>
And some still do that, only continuing to hold an open wound so they have someone to blame. <p>Tuan {Cupcakes} the Vicar</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ulurikeen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lurikeen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 307<br> <font color=#E9D756>(2/9/02 6:28:44 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=266.topic&index=27>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: wow</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> &quot;That's the problem, you see it as a long time as many others do.

<br>
Kanibaal raises a very good point. The people who have been oppressed by racism simply because they are black are alive today and remember the hatred many white people showed them.<br>
<br>
A wider issue is that the US Federal Government had done little to stop racism and in particular the South. In general, I can see the perspectives of some that want the US Federal Government to compensate them for the extreme hardships they underwent.<br>
<br>
On the other hand, when will this cease? Does financial compensation really reverse the sins of the past? For that matter, doesn't having a &quot;Black pledge of allegiance&quot; simply reinstate segregation... a &quot;reverse segregation&quot;?<br>
<br>
I believe that all US Citizens should be concerned when the fundamentals of the country are tampered with openly. The Pledge of Allegiance is one of those fundamentals. <br>
<br>
The Pledge of Allegiance has already been used to divide the US. In 1892 when the pledge was first formulated it simply read &quot;I pledge allegiance to my Flag and the Republic for which it stands, one nation, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.&quot; In 1954, after the Knights of Columbus lobbied heavily in congress, the pledge was changed with the addition of &quot;under God&quot;. The change was a blatant message in response to the so-called &quot;Red Scare&quot; that the US was not an atheistic communist country. However, the change also continues to be used to erode the fundamental pursuit of liberty in the US. Many athiests, such as my self, and other non-christians have been attacked for our beliefs by Christians who like to claim that the US is a &quot;Christian&quot; nation. Usually they pull out a dollar bill and point at the Pledge of Allegiance as evidence (when in fact it is not).<br>
<br>
It is best not to tamper with the Pledge of Allegiance. Sure, if some black private schools want an additional pledge to their race, then have at it. However, there is a large difference between a pledge to country and a pledge to race. One is a pledge of loyalty to all countrymen/countrywomen; the other is a racist pledge. When whites utter such a pledge (like the KKK and Neo-Nazis) they are at once denounced as scum sucking garbage. <p>Lurikeen Mali'Kyre<BR>

The flag of the United States is not red, blask, and green. If one wants to salute another flag, then fine, but to pledge allegiance to &quot;one nation of black people&quot;? What nation is that? Not the United States. And, just what is the &quot;land we must obtain&quot;? Does that mean all others that are not black are going to be rounded up by these people?<br>
<br>
The United States is a multi-ethnic country. The above &quot;black pledge&quot; seems to deny that with statements that would count as racist if you sustitute &quot;black&quot; with &quot;white&quot;. <p>Lurikeen Mali'Kyre<BR>

The mention of the flag and there homeland is because so much of this identity was stripped from them. Do you think plantation owners who took there names from them allowed them to keep memoirs from there past? No. So, in the sixties there was a big search for identity amongst the blacks. They went to the trouble of rediscovering there roots and by rewriting the pledge they are showing there youths there is another part of America. A part not decended from the Union Jack. I don't think it means they are going to force whitey out i think it means they are going to obtain America like they weren't previously allowed to. They began to vote, to open businesses, and to own property. That is how are ancestors obtained America. Well that and genocide. <br>
<br>
I do not need a pledge because my ancestors were allowed to fly there flag from the day they got here. They were allowed to cook there foods, teach there songs, myths and legends. They were allowed to pass there names onto there heirs. I am not an apologist, but i figure allowing them some concessions they have been stripped of is not that big of a deal. You want to deal with racism in schools find out why New York is dropping cops in schools that have an unremarkable violence rate, becuase the students there are at &quot;risk&quot; (read minority). White people don't want there schools looking like prisons so they don't. You know what the end result of uniformed police in a school is: higher drop out rate. Turns out cops aren't trained to deal with kids and kids don't feel like being in a jail like environment when they don't have to.<br>

Where do school shootings occur? Jonesboro, Columbine, and other places with high white populations. These places PRIOR to shootings had just as high if not higher violence rate than the inner city schools. I wish I could find the article that mentioned this. One of the other points was it wasn't always the best representations of the police sent to schools. It was the ones the department didn't want on the streets. When you were in high school would you have wanted your diciplinary actions handled by the police. Get in an argument with a teacher, Officer Jones escorts you out in front of your peirs. That's the reality. I know there are a lot of problems in schools and I have tremendous respect for teachers and cops, but I don't think turning schools into prisons is the answer. <br>
<br>
<br>
Also just to clarify, were you implying that all minorities made nervous by cops are guilty of something, most likely pushing drugs? <br>
<br>
I also don't believe a cop in a school is going to stop a killing. No school killing has been planned with a reasonable escape, they all seem to expect or want to get caught and it only takes a second to light a fuse, pull a trigger, thrust with a knife. The cops are there to prevent the minor outbreaks which is all that had occured. The same as has occured in every high school across the country since probably the dawn of public education. I have heard stories from my elders of their school fights. I know this does not justify violence but violence between hormonally driven high pressure peer groups will occur it is the nature of the beast. <br>
<br>
How come this racial inequity is justifiable by you, but the black pledge is offensive? Why be devisive?  If the era of oppression is dead why aren't the cops sent to the white majority schools? I am sure there are drug dealers and bullies there too. <br>

<br>
Just so I am not taking you out of context, do you support the current policy or are you saying police should be deployed to ALL schools not just minority ones? Do you consider it at least a little hmmm... odd that they are deployed primarily to mainly minority schools? <br>
<br>
&quot;And why would any law abiding student be afraid of a cop. The only reason people feel &quot;nervous&quot; around cops is if they have something to hide, plain and simple&quot;<br>

Ideally that is true. Unfortunately the cops have not always been fair to minorities and you are taught that you are guilty till proven innocent on the streets. Plus these cops sent to schools are as I said the ones who are taken off the streets for some reason. Ideally I'd like to believe that the police department is sending ol' Officer Mahoney down to the East Side Elementary for the last six months of his career before retirement. Unfortunately undesirable for street could mean more than just old. Racial profiling is also something that cops have used in the past. Many kids have seen the Rodney King tapes. The OJ Simpson trial. Unfortunately the cops don't always show there best faces to minorities. I think perhaps the cops have gained more respect after S11 form minorities, but all it is going to take is some cop yelling nigger while swinging a club to reopen a couple centuries of racial division.<br>
<br>
The point of bringing up the cop situation however was that cops were sent to mainly minority schools that showed no indication of a rise in violence or unbearable violence. This is in my opinion a racial inequity and one I see as more devisive than the black pledge. The comments by the students about the black pledge all sounded positive and non-devisive. The comments by the students in the patrolled minority schools was negative and they felt like their schools had become prisons. So this is why I would say the pledge is the lesser evil than the police in schools. <br>

I totally disagree with this pledge. I am raising 4 children to respect everyone they meet regardless of their race or background. I don't know why in this day and age we care so much about race. My kids attend a public school and should not have to feel uncomfortable when they don't understand an African pledge. I am sure even though the school is a majority of black people that there aren't those of different origin. They could stand there doing a pledge to 50 different countries and finish by lunch time.<br>
I believe the pledge was created out of respect for what the country has to offer. That is why people spend their lives trying to get here. Sure the word "God" is mentioned but can be fixed quite easily with <insert you choice of religious idol here> instead of totally writing a new one that degrades others around you. I am frankly tired of paying for what others have done. All I want to do is live my life, raise my kids and feel free in the country I call home.<br>

Paying back each black is impossible. Do mullatoes (sp?) get half the pay? Do people who immigrated after slavery pay/get paid? A different idea going around is to figure out how much the original slaves were owed in reparations and invest that money into an underground railroad museum or other such thing to celebrate the strength of the blacks who fought for there freedom. I think this is a very fair idea.<br>
