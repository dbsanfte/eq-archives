We have social programs because our government finally realized that 'life isn't fair' and if the poor weren't helped, they would help themselves to the rich.  IMO we need to stop giving money to poor nations and get involved in the decisions making process when we give money to them.  Build business, schools etc... that are competetive with others around the world.  <br>  Haven't poor nations been caught in the crossfire of economic warfare over the past 50 years?  Ever think they might be taking economic/social bullets?  Are hit and run tactics by gangs or suicide bombings ok because some are less fortunate?  Hell no!!  But I think the point is, not to define what about their action was wrong, but to understand why someone would feel so passionately about something.  <br>  Why do they feel so passionately?  BECAUSE their life sux balls 24/7.  Complete and utter sadness.  CHOICE:  feel depressed for the rest of your 24/7 ball-sukin life OR show other people how it feels to live your life.  Especially those who tend to ignore you or even a scapegoat(like America) who can be used to unite people on a common ground&lt;--Religion/Islam.   <br>  When gangs are having issues with other gangs, infighting occurs.  When there is a common enemy, they unite.  Al-Qaida, while much more extreme than 'gangs' are, represent the same deviant response to (what some economic minority might feel) is a repressive society.  Of course America give more to charity and other countries than anyone else does BY FAR.  BUT, 1st world countries are so involved in economic competition that they are scared to take their attention off the competition for more than a small period of time so they don't get nailed themselves.  Can you blame the 1st world countries?  I don't totally think so.  <br>  Nevertheless, the world would be a much more productive place(as it has been in America since the advent of social programs in the past 50 years) if they take an Agreed Time-out(ceasefire if you will) and asses the battlewounds the poor countries have endured from the 1st world countries economic tanks(Corporations if you will) running through their countries.  (obviously the comparisons made are abstract examples used as models so we can visualize 'what is going on'- So please be open-minded)  <br>   America and other 1st world countries need to stop handing out welfare to these countries and actually engage them culturally and economically.  If they don't want to be engaged culturally and economically then lets tell them to suck our American schlongs.  If they do, then lets sincerely help them develop a competitive economic program .  Ending the economic problems in these countries will replace the little hope they have, and then some.  Though deviance will always exist and is an important aspect of humanity, it won't be near as severe if people are satisfied economically.    <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ucendan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Cendan</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/image/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 397<br> <font color=#E9D756>(12/20/01 12:37:14 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=255.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Difference between Al-Qaida and the Bloods and Crypts of</span><hr size=1> The terrorists we face have nothing to do with money.  In fact, despite what most of Afghanastan looks like, the people we are facing had access to LOTS of cash until this all happened.  Probably still do just have to be more secretive.<br><br>America is one of the few countries (despite being called a "christian" nation) where money rules most religions, and most wouldn't die for their beliefs.<br><br>We will never be at peace with these terrorists because of our culture and how it offends them.  In America people add religion with a sprinkle and head to church on Christmas and Easter.  Its a piece in the puzzle of an already busy life.  In their country it is life.  There is no reason to exist if not to serve "god" and nation (what we would call culture, or ethnicity).<br><br>I know, this post uses a lot of generalizations so don't come back and tell me how religious you are here in America, or how some guy over there just goes through the motions.

Some were really good programs too; for instance, the UN supplied first-rate building supplies and plans for the Palestinian refugees, back in the day.<br><br>Of course, the refugees couldn't be bothered to leave the bread line in order to build decent homes for themselves. So, not to be deterred, the UN hired outside labor. The outside labor arrived to find that the Palestinians had stolen and sold most of the building supplies on the black market.<br><br>These days, cultural engagement in most of these places implies close combat of some sort.

Don't shit yourself...not every toilet in the world is Somalia. Most of them have really profitable resources like...petroleum?<br><br>Whenever there's a lull in the ongoing intertribal genocidal warfare, they sometimes manage to mine something and sell it. Or plant and harvest a crop of opium poppies. At which point the &quot;democratically elected leadership&quot; pockets the profits and either moves to Cannes, or stays to try and reap next year's profits.<br><br>Assassinating said leadership only results in another fuckhead taking over. Actually helping the people by supervising the transfer of power just gets us accused of being tyrannical warmonger imperialists. Or whatever the hip phrase happens to be at the moment.<br><br>And since the people themselves are usually still trying to figure out the wonders of stucco and crop rotation, shit like setting up bicammeral legislative power balanced with a chief executive isn't high on the priority list. So even if you ignore the pussies and help them get on their feet, there's a even chance that they'll be killing each other in the streets again in less than five years.<br><br>Welcome to the 3rd world, and to why no one takes Noam Chomsky seriously. =) <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showMessage?topicID=8.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showMessage?topicID=254.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=255.topic&index=2><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/gfx/addReply1.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.emailToFriend?topicID=255.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.threadControl?topicID=255.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/deleteThreadFire.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=255.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=255.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub4.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="emarrmessageboardrules">Message Board Rules<option value="emarrlinks">Links<option value="emarrupcomingmmorpgs">Upcoming MMOG's<option value="emarrfrm16">The Emarr Quadrant<option value="emarrfrm18">America Under Attack<option value="emarrfrm19">Dark Age of Camelot<option value="emarrgeneral">General<option value="emarrfrm17">Funny Stuff<option value="emarrbazaar">Item Bazaar<option value="emarrscrollsnspells">Spell Bazaar<option value="emarrfrm15">Shiny Things<option value="emarrfrm14">Bargain Basement<option value="emarrdragonsandplanes">Rants and Flames<option value="emarrfrm13">Dragons and Planes<option value="emarrroleplaying">Roleplaying<option value="emarrroleplayingoocforum">Roleplaying - OOC Forum<option value="emarrscammeralert">Scammer Alert<option value="emarrsignaturecorner">Test Forum<option value="emarrreallife">Real Life<option value="emarrothermmorpgs">Other MMOG's</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#E9D756>- </font><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/bemarr>Erollisi Marr, The Queen of Love</a><font color=#E9D756> - </font><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18>America Under Attack</a> <font color=#E9D756> - </font><br><br> <br><br><center><font face="Verdana" size="2">Entertaining the Erollisi Marr community since 12/16/99!</font></center><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br> <br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.4 b8<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
