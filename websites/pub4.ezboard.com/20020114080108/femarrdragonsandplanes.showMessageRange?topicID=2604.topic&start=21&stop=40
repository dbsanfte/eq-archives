Very conspiracy from golgar and blaze to use say modus infront UI member.<br>

im surprised to find good manners in combination with Bubu and Gilgamel, but well im not surprised that this topic found this area. Gilgamel you told me already 3 weeks ago you want do that, was too busy to post it? <br>
<br>
whatever happend yesterday is the result from an individual person and we called a GM to clarify and hopefully we will know it today. <br>

if you just want to use this flame to kick DG as a Guild again, just jump on the train.<br>

<br>
  I wasn't in the zone at the time the incident took place.  However, I zoned in shortly afterwards.  Being curious, I took a look around.<br>
<br>
  The DG ranger in question was dead on the South side of the central pillar, along with another DG member (an enchanter who's name I can't remember).  The 3 Wyverns from N ToV where in the halls of testing, and there were a LOT of dead UI people around.<br>
<br>
  From the evidence I could see, and some small knowledge of how the mobs path / roam / aggro in ToV, there is absolutely no reason why the N ToV Wyverns would be in the HoT unless someone trained them there.  Somehow, I don't think UI trained themselves and there is no way in hell that they got from there to the HoT without SOMEONE, buffed to the hilt because they hit like freight trains, delibrately pulled them there.<br>
<br>
  Although UI may not have the best reputation on the server, in this particular case I personally believe DG trained the living hell out of them.  Not only while they were fighting Doze (which I could possibly accept as an innocent, if incredibly stupid, mistake) but again while they were CRing. <br>
<br>
  I don't have an axe to grind here.  I get on with some people in UI, I get on with some people in DG.  I'm as close to a neutral party as you're going to get.  And I, for one, am VERY disappointed in DG.  If you've got issues with UI then work them out in an appropriate manner.  Training mobs onto someone mid fight is NOT appropriate in any way, shape or form.<br>
<br>
  The high level game is difficult enough without having to deal with this sort of crap. <br>

And I love the &quot;Well, since Bubu trained us 1 year, 3 months, 12 days, 7 hours and 34 minutes ago in Lower Gukk, he has no room to bitch about us training his guild!&quot; defense.<br>
<br>
Sure they have room to complain, because you guys are doing the exact same thing to them that you didn't like having done to you. It's hypocritical. Since when did two wrongs make a right?<br>
<br>
Lastly... things like this are only likely to make future encounters WORSE unless the guilds work something out. Did you think that by training them, another guild of their size and strength, that they wouldn't realize they were being trained? Do you think that training them was going to make them &quot;go away&quot;? So maybe you ruined their shot at Doze this time... but is it going to be worth it down the road when their members see YOU guys pumping up for uber_mob_31, and decide to give a little love in return?<br>

As for the so-called &quot;proof&quot;, it was definitely inappropriate to say it but it was just a couple of members joking around out loud. <br>
<br>
We are asking the guides/GMs to investigate who trained what and if any member is found guilty of intentionally doing so, rest assured that we will take the appropriate action against him/her. However, if we are found innocent by the staff, we expect a full apology from UI for these allegations. Further, to show our goodwill, we are leaving Dozekar alone tonight and letting UI have another go at him, so good luck this time. <br>
<br>
We have nothing against UI, only that Gilgamel has been continuously harrassing us the past few weeks and even nearly messed up one of our Dozekar pulls while shadowing us, which I'm sure he didn't do intentionally.

in addition why would your members joke around like that , espically given the history of that you say there is between ui and dg .. <br>

Gailen would NEVER do something like that intentionally.  He's one of the top notch people on this server. <p><center><b><i><font size=6 color="YELLOW"><a href="http://www.afflictionguild.com/profile.php?username=Pinganon&charactername=Pinganon">Pinganon Windrider</a></font><br>

Enaak gave the incoming and attack message in OOC for everyone to see.  This wasn't intentional as he was using this channel while we were in ST and forgot to change it for ToV.  The 2nd train was definitely no accident since it is extremely difficult to get NToV mobs to HoT without deliberate training.  Now just a hunch, but if you see 30+ UI in ToV, they are usually in HoT and asking in say while next to the door to HoT if anyone is in there isn't that hard to do.<br>
