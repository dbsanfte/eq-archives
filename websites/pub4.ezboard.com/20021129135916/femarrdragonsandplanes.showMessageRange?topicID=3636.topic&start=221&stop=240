I like Ninya, I would not wish to dissapoint her. There is no raid that I signed up for that I didnt attend. My obligation ends there. Anything else is a courtesy. If I had not signed up, why would anyone expect me to show? That doesnt make sence. At least not to me.&quot;<br>
<br>
Doesnt make sense to me either, since this never was a &quot;policy&quot;.  And face Ninya?  Ninya was the loot coordinator at the time, she could care less if anyone was there or not. lol  Oh and I never expect anyone to show, they just do because they are a part of CE.<br>

If a guild member, by his actions, even if the actions are simply taking no action<br>

If Hopkins was NOT a member, what the hell was he doing on the raid?<br>
and why was harassing a guild member NOT a consideration of his becomming a member?<br>
<br>
You can rationalize all you want Til, In my judgement you decieved me. <br>
You didnt back me in a faction fight. The fact that you say you dont care about the evidence is a concession that it favors me. In my book that means <br>
you are untrustworthy, and you make bad decisions. You openly promote<br>
favoritism. You withold crucial information. All the while I was just an e-mail away.<br>
And you blame me, for not being able to read your mind and know I was in jepardy.<br>

For over a year I didnt respond to Hoppkins baiting because that is what good guildmates do. In each instance before this blowup I bent over backwards<br>
to NOT talk about CE. I swallowed my natural inclination, and backed down.<br>
I was following that policy up to the post where my guild leader said <br>

As most of the long time CE members know, Tilian/Ninya and I have had our differences.   But in this situation, I don't think ANYONE (beside Chiteng) thinks they are wrong.   Tilian stood up for Chiteng against the protestations of many in the guild.  He gave Chiteng the opportunity to show whether he deserved to wear the guild tag.  Chiteng showed his true colors.<br>

Chit, you can't be too tired of this boring thread, which you started, since you are still posting so lets stop throwing out things that you do not mean.<br>
<br>
As for being a peer, I'm sure of a few things on this.<br>
<br>
- To you, your perception, noone here can be your peer because you put yourself up on a pedestal. Noone else does mind you, but you do. You hover at this self created level where you feel <br>
- you do not need to justify your claims with proof.<br>
- you and you alone know the real truth (even though you never tell us what it is)<br>
- you and you alone are the moral thermometer and anyone who does not live by it is beneath you.<br>
- you and you alone make the rules regarding how a converstaion works, and again anyone who does not converse your way is beneath you.<br>
<br>
You are a megalomaniac, through and through, and thus it is impossible for anyone to be your peer unless of course they too suffer the same delusions as you.<br>
<br>
- The reality of the situation. In this context, we are all peers, like it or not. You can argue it all you want, but you will be the only one thinking that way. (This is normal however).<br>
<br>
At least however you are consistant. Look at how you converse/debate. You put out a comment. Folks respond. If they OPENLY oppose you, they are immediatly sheep. If they subtely oppose you they are miguided or incapable of understanding.<br>
<br>
Also, anyone who opposes you gets a version of the, <br>
-Im too important to waste my time with your response <br>
<br>
Then, you pull the EVER so childish move of &quot;running to Nuldar&quot;. Now, I dont know Nuldar I am sure he is a great guy but he isn't your little guardian angel.<br>
<br>
<br>
I have no idea how old you are, I have no idea where you come from, but I am sure of one thing. I have met PLENTY more people 16 - 80 who are more open minded and more capable of conversation. You are a pretentious man and this entire thread is yet another example of flexing your self indulged, delusional status of all knowing and all caring.<br>
<br>
I wish, and hope that someday you can learn to talk to people. Until you do, this is going to be the crap you are going to get. . . <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

So? Yes that is certainly kind of him, but IF I am not made aware of it AT THAT TIME, why should it be a consideration now? You expect me to show graditude<br>

<br>
Eido (aka original Morphius) <br>
**************************************************************<br>
Really? and what colors are those exactly? Your saying that I did what?<br>
It sounds to me that it is because I did NOTHING that Tillian is pissed.<br>
How does doing NOTHING impose upon the guild? I am fascinated.<br>
So being inactive is the same as being a kill stealer or a loot whore?<br>
Tell me what Items do I have that the guild gave me? Do you even know?<br>
One cloth glove that is no drop. It is totally useless unles you have the full set.<br>
No one on the raid wanted it so I got it. Wow I am such a loot whore.<br>
I will make the determination of if I want to wear a guild tag. You are not a consideration.<br>
<br>
You dont even understand what I am angry about. I knew I was dead in CE the day<br>
they made Hoppkins an officer. But I did have hope that Til had some personal intergrity. I did hope that IF that policy was such a big issue that he would enforce<br>
it impatially. That would mean btw NO POSTS HERE FROM CE MEMBERS.<br>
Well I was wrong. You see if I were the guild leader, I would have told the entire guild 'the next person that makes any post on the EM board gets deguilded.<br>
If Hoppkins posted, I would de-guild him. Its all very simple.<br>
<br>
I sure as hell would not have allowed 'in raid harrasment' of a guildmate.<br>
That issue would have been confronted head on.<br>

I knew I was dead in CE the day<br>
they made Hoppkins an officer. ***<br>
<br>
You dont even know when Hoppkins became a member of CE and if you did know why are you still guilded in CE?<br>
<br>
Seems like you are insanely out of touch of what goes on in your own guild, err former guild.<br>
<br>
Wouldnt it just be better for you to say a good day to CE and thank them for giving you a chance in the first place?<br>
Why come post here in a cloud of sour grapes and challenge their policies on a public forum?<br>
<br>
Becuase your feelings were hurt? becuase you were deguilded on this board? <br>
<br>
Well guess what, toughshit its your own posting that lead to this, you have nobody to blame but yourself. You, by your own admission are over the age of 30 and anyone that old (btw im 31 in 2 months so dont try that 19 year old punkshit on me)<br>
should  be able to accept rejection like a civilized MAN<br>
<br>
You have their e-mail adresses, you could have privately asked about rejoining CE or even had Words with their leadership and tried to work something out. But you didnt do that, you decided that you would start a smear campaign against CE and hope you would publicly embarass them by posting their guild policies. <br>
<br>
Your mistake was assuming any of us would agree with you and  flame CE too.<br>
<br>
If i had to judge your performance in CE , id do it this way.<br>
lets see.<br>
Member for a year and a half<br>
attended 6 raids<br>
quit EQ<br>
Started a hate campaign against 2 officers who had the audacity to question chitengs position as a member in CE<br>
refused to raid becuase of these 2 officers.<br>
was not a contributing member in CE<br>
The other members HATE him.<br>
oh yes now hes openly flaming members on a public forum.<br>
<br>
Would you like to know my verdict on if you should be a member in CE Chit?<br>
