Basically, after the testing I did in game, i came to the conclusion that the only thing charisma was really good for ever, was charming.  I have never seen any_convincing evidence that has proven to me that screaming terror or fear are affected by my charisma(negative or positive). So lets get that right outta the way. Do what i did and buy some charisma jewelry, 7cha rings, 9cha mask, get some 5cha earings from unrest, crude stein. This should put you over 100cha or pretty damn close, you can get a couple more pieces of it if you want. you wanna buy something for cheap? just put your cha gear on! when you go back out huntign take it off cuz its useless(unless charming and i'll talk on that later).<br>
Ok, onto the topic of AC. At least you have gotten past your first phase probably( insane intelligence!).   Im not sure by your comments if you think AC will decrease how much life CoB takes off your life but im here to tell you it does not.  At high lvl(50+), necro in my opinion is all about managing your hps.  If I was to make a necro from scratch right now, it would be iksar, and i would have every god damn regen item in the fricken game that could possibly stack because that is the way to be incredibly mana effecient.  For a necro, your hps = mana. burn it into your mind, more hps = more room to manage your mana!  how often do you actually get hit? I can see if you solo often you might get hit sometimes, but the fact that you can have more room to drain your life back and give life to your pet and sac hps for mana(cob) just from hps, in my mind makes going the hp route way way way more beneficial than the small amount of times you are going to actually get hit.<br>
Maybe in special situations you want to carry around some high AC gear(though I still disagree with it), then do that, when you expect to be tanking something alot.  I am a big fan of stepping in and take hits for your pets if you either have full life, or your pet is going to die and you want him to live. pact his boney ass, step in take some hits, step out, drain, step in take a couple, repact etc. or pact him, dot drain, step in and harmshield sit down. god that probably does'nt even work anymore 8(.<br>
Just to demonstrate what you will be doing at high lvls, here was my experiences.  I found myself on raids at least, giving my mana to clerics and enchanters, mages etc. so i wanted to have the highest possible hitpoints so that I could lich(high form of call of bones), mana robe my way down to 30 hps or so(yes i am crazy in the cabeza), then get a cheal from a cleric breastplate and do it all over again.  Now a days necros have it easier, they can drain uber mobs and dont' have to get heals themselves as much(or i think they can drain the eye pet still now too).<br>
<br>
So, to sum it up, <br>
hitpoints = your mana! <br>
your mana = how you do damage! <br>
AC = valueable only part of the time! <br>
cha = poopy except for charming!<br>
<br>
If you are really a raid necro later, or even w/o being raid eligable, you can get some pretty damn decent hps, heck back in the day b4 velious I had aroudn 1400 buffed. and when velious came out, b4 i quit i had hmm close to 2000 unbuffed(venr passed me up aroudn 2k and I think the most uber necro right now if he had the best gear in the game could probably muster around 2600hps unbuffed).<br>
<br>
about the charisma thing. charisma, at least for me, wasn't always worth it. i did extensive charming in lowerguk(thats another 2 page post and story time) with both extremely low charisma and pretty damn high(140). I have had super long charms with low charisma or under 60, and short charms with charisma of 140. and ive had the super short charms under 60 and super long with 140.  So its not like just cuz you have high charisma your minimum charm time is increased, its still random.  But i do believe it will help you in general achieve longer charms times. But you can't be saraficing just any piece of gear for some +5cha item.  Be careful, sacrafice your low +hps items(you should have some +hps on every piece of your gear 8P) for some high +cha gear.  Its also important to keep in mind that when your charming your gonna have resists and breaks so you NEED some decent hps to be able to re-ST and recharm, or root so you dont' die. especially if your doing some lord charming!(&lt;attempts to resist telling another 2 page story about lowerguk&gt;)<br>
<br>
anyway, hope this helps. I think I have probably helped 20+ necros move past the int or cha or AC stage of their carreer into the HP god stage8P.<br>
it feels like I am forgetting something but i can't seem to place it, bah im out of my element anymore 8( so sad, I should come back and visit my home sometime 8P <br>
there are some AC necors out there, or there used to be when i played, if i recall I was unable to fully convert kidney from his AC ways, so try sending him a tell if you want the AC necro side of the story, or kidney post here ! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  long tiem bro.<br>
