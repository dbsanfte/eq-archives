Tweety(sanya) = Abashi in that regard. Dont tell people its fixed if it isnt and if you dont have proof that it is.<br>
So much for quality on the main reason for RvR, which is the main selling point. Geesh.<br>

she said it was working once the doors were fixed.<br>
<br>
That alone reminded me of Absor/Abashi of the &quot;it is working&quot; when in fact its not.<br>
<br>
So either <br>
<br>
A) she lied<br>
or<br>
B) she was talking out her ass.<br>

either way, its the same thing.<br>

<br>
Yes, Mythic and/or Sanya stated that relic taking was possible now that the doors were fixed. We found this to be false last evening when we did, in fact, attempt to take a relic and were unable to do so. The big difference is that Sanya showed up, to Merlin/Midgard, acknowledged the bug and stated that it would be fixed asap.<br>
<br>
To give a small example of the way things like this were handled in EQ, ill simply reference you to the entire Kunark expansion. When it went live, the players were promised 10 new levels of advancement and spells to go along, some of which were mob-dropped. Verant delivered somewhere around half of that. Spells weren’t dropping, at all, on any server. New spells were only sold by vendors, there were no drops.<br>
<br>
We, your fellow players, posted/reported/sent emails for over a month and all we ever got was a one or two liner from Abashi stating, “they’re in the game, you just aren't looking in the right places.” My guild found this odd, being that we had thoroughly explored every zone in the expansion with the exception of Veeshan’s Peek, yet we hadn’t found a single spell.<br>
<br>
Roughly a month after our initial complaint was registered on the official EQ boards, Abashi actually decided that all this whining may have some merit, so he checked out the spell drops. Imagine our amazement when he stated that he killed over 200 mobs in Sebilis and not a single spell dropped.<br>
<br>
There in lies the difference… and it wasn’t like the spell drops were the first instance of him not believing the players, even when threads reached 500 replies all stating the same thing(alchemy, mage pets, etc). <p><b>Vendrix</b><br>

Period! There is no denying that. What she does after she lies or talks out her ass, well, it dont matter cuz the damage is done. If you dont have all the facts you shouldnt be telling people it works. Thats it, Bottom line.<br>
<br>
Sanya/Mythic have been tossing on the PR spin since day one, and these recent events just confirm that. Am I saying Verant is better? Hell No, but I am saying that Mythics BS is JUST as BAD. Lieing to a customer base is just fucked up, plain and simple. Camelot Herald, their new website, ENCOURAGED people to take the relics. Now THATS fucked uP considering IT DOESNT WORK! <br>
<br>
Let me ask, Does it now? Doubtful, and soon they will say it does again. Will it actually? Wont know till its done again, and then what, then what if it dont? <br>
<br>
Also, we can look at some other things she has stated if you like..<br>
<br>
1) Rogues will have a good idea of their paths BEFORE the free month expires.. <br>
<br>
thats laughable at best.<br>
<br>
2) Crit Shot for archers IS working, we tested it..<br>
<br>
haha..tell that to those that arent doing any damage. Come to find out their 'tests' were faulty and half were and the other half werent.<br>
<br>
3) We wont stealth nerf like the 'other comany'.<br>
<br>
hehe that made me laugh.<br>
<br>
<br>
should I go on?<br>
Shall I even post most of the manual that isnt even in game yet? or when it might be? Or class balance? or RvR balance? <br>
<br>
They have apologized sure, I can apologize too but it doesnt actually mean i mean it. Apologies are worth about as much as the crap they been spewing forth lately.<br>

Mostly the people on the camelot boards saying 'fix me, fix me' or 'nerf them, nerf them'.<br>
<br>
To say they lied is wrong in my opinion.  I've never actually hear them blatently lie.  They try to fix things, and it either doesn't go through 100% or something else breaks.  (Remind you of any other games besides EQ?  I can think of a few).  It's not easy to build a game and flaming Mythic constantly doesn't boost their confidence any.<br>
<br>
With regards to relics, I read they fixed the doors, but I guess they didn't think to look at if the relic can be moved or not.  And now they know and they will fix it.<br>
<br>
Camelot is a good game, released a little bit early as it could have used another month or two of straight tweaking and beta.  But in the coming months I'm sure Mythic will address many issues and actually fix them close to 100%.  And Mythic has done a good job of trying to acknowledge what is wrong when it is descoverd.  They do have to have more extensive testing methods to prevent them from upgrading something and it not working for half the population of the game. <p><center><img src="http://members.rogers.com/stellarthief/ancientwalker02.jpg"></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uarikel.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Arikel</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 2022<br> <font color=#E9D756>(12/6/01 6:53:15 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=46.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Nice going Midguard on Merlin</span><hr size=1> So they fucked up.

<br>
A Major selling point is bugged..no one tested this? Thats Ludicrous in itself.<br>
<br>
As far as lieing, someone asked if it worked, they said it would once the doors were fixed....it didnt and STILL wasnt tested.<br>
<br>
And you can say thats not BS? and Shit Happens? I want to work for you! Damn!<br>
<br>
Thats like buying a car without a steering wheel...sure it may look nice and drive nice once it installed, but to not install it and make sure it works properly is insane. And then to tell everyone once you get wheels on the car you should be fine, completely overlooking the fact the steering wheel is still missing.<br>
<br>
I have overlooked a lot of, hmm,  shall we say  'disappointments' ? Toon being a Rogue and all.<br>
<br>
But geez, c'mon now. If a main piece of the game doesnt actually work, what else is wrong? What else is gonna change?<br>
And before you go on a shpeel about how all MMORPG's change..well DUH! But this is a major game flaw. Mechanics that should have been tested thorouhly(sp). If something like this is missed..what else.<br>

<br>
i'm disappointed.  i play the albion realm and would have lost a relic in that whole thing, but i'm still disappointed.  i think the whole thing was cruddy too.<br>
<br>
i see all the things mythic states as fixed, but aren't really, so they say ok...we didn't get it right, but we got it this time...only to not get it right that time either..well, third times the charm.  (i'm still bugged by the fact that i can't get my cloak emblemized cause they never really fixed that bug, but hey, it's minor.)<br>
<br>
but you know, even if your product doesn't meet all expectations, customer service will ALWAYS make up the difference.  acknowledgement of the issue, prompt response to the issue, attemps to rectify the issue, compensation for the error (yes, they do this too), NOT ACCUSING THE CLIENT OF BEING A MORON WHO CAN'T FIGURE IT OUT (ala vendrix post above)...and not making excuses...all go a long way towards keeping a player happy.<br>
<br>
i'll admit, i know exactly jack about programming, but i've played enough of these games to know that fixing one thing almost always busts something else.  it could be that relics did work just fine, but in some other fix they made, somehow, somewhere, they oopsed the relic enabled status.  sanya likely thought she was giving correct information with the knowledge that she had of the situation, but was wrong.  (not lying, not talking out of her ass, just mistaken).  we already know they are severely lacking in their testing department, that's such old news that we almost consider ourselves beta testers as it is.  but honestly, i've felt like that in every single game i've ever played, and i've been gaming for a good while in these new fangled gaming systems that took the these style games out of text base.  <br>
<br>
we all knew when we bought the game that it was incomplete.  we all knew when we bought the game that it would take a long while before it would be complete.  we all knew that the testing process was slow and lacking, that they are trying so hard to get everything out at once without patching for ten years (don't miss that one bit) that they mess up at times (a lot)...i didn't even beta test, and i knew all of this stuff was the case.  i still bought the game, still play the game, still enjoy the game just fine and am pleased that they keep up the service they have promised to provide from day one.<br>
<br>
no, i am not happy with the crap that happens...i don't like that they changed hibernian (not my realm) bard songs without giving any notice whatsoever because they did say they wouldn't do that.  i dont like that they constantly say they fixed things when they aren't fixed.  i don't like that their testing sucks...lots of stuff is wrong.  but honestly, i have more important things in life to get totally worked up over than a game..especially when they are trying their hardest to please me even in the face of numerous errors.<br>
<br>

From Sanya's last comment.  They fixed the doors and the relic was supost to be moveable, but apparently during the going live process something screwed up.  They're working on it.<br>
<br>
And complain, complain, flame, flame that's all many people seem to be able to do... Can't put forth constructive comments.  And honestly if people don't like it they leave, good for them.  And if you leave and still bitch about it, then go make a better game.<br>
<br>

That’s less than the any single realm population on the least crowded server.<br>
<br>
A relic keep raid on that server would probably take just about every person logged in, to accomplish successfully. <p><b>Vendrix</b><br>

Nothing can compare to delibrete deception and outright lies that we got/get<br>
from Verant.<br>
<br>
Examples are many but just to recall a few:<br>
<br>
Denying they were nerfing rubucite and then claiming that removing it wasnt nerfing it. <br>
Denying the designed sever population limits, and denying that they were exceeded.<br>
Promising to correct the above (never happened)<br>
I dont even want to start of what they did to monks, just ask any old monk.<br>
Never fixing obvious area bugs.<br>
Remember logging on into Lava? A good test of RL dexterity to see if you<br>
could make it out in time.<br>
The falling thru water Bug they denied existed. <br>
I know what most of you think of Clinton but these guys beat him easy.<br>
<br>
I dont see ANYTHING like that with Mythic, and they do answer the phone.<br>
I think the development shows some signs of being rushed BUT<br>
common guys - live in the real world. Nobody does nothing for free. They must<br>
make money to survive. This isnt an LPmud that they can upgrade at leasuire.<br>
So they decided to take the risk and I dont find anything truely offensive<br>
in their code except the serious lag in Camelot. <br>

<br>
So I suggested to Mythic to enable all realm player creation on Pendragon so people can really *test* the game.  Also a neat addition would be something like 5x, xp.  This may encourage people to go, and successful testing may get done.<br>
<br>
Chiteng I agree with you, except I get no lag in the game.  But if you are refering to the city of Camelot, that places has horrid lag. <p><center><img src="http://members.rogers.com/stellarthief/ancientwalker02.jpg"></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uarikel.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Arikel</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 2025<br> <font color=#E9D756>(12/7/01 11:07:07 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=46.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Mythic vs Verant</span><hr size=1> Pendragon already has all realm character creation. <p>Ahry - hero of Gaoth an Iar, Percival server <BR>

<br>
Much like Everquest, the people on the Test server are basically playing on a normal server that happens to host the next patch. They are playing in a testing environment and are, therefore, supposed to be testing – but are they or do they even know what they’re supposed to test? I know when I read the patch message, and some of them are fairly extensive, I only pick out the details that pertain to my class and more specifically, things about my class I actually care about and I’ve missed some things too.<br>
<br>
I think your Devs should code in a Test server only popup window that’s displayed as soon as a character loads(would be keyed on your realm/class). It would show something like:<br>
<br>
<b>Thane specific changes in this patch:</b><br>
<br>
1. Buffs extended to 10 minutes from 5.<br>
2. Bob’s spell of smiting damaged increased by 10%.<br>
<br>
<b>Midgard specific changes in this patch:</b><br>
<br>
1. East Svealand given more rare drop items.<br>
2. New horse route added from Huginfell to Galplen<br>
<br>
<b>General changes in this patch:</b><br>
<br>
1. Keep doors are now targetable and able to be destroyed.<br>
2. Relics can now be looted and taken.<br>
3. Weapon styles should now scale up with level.<br>
<br>
With this, your testers know exactly what is new in the patch message that they need to test. They know what's specific to their class and what applies to everyone, they don’t need to be distracted by mob loot tables applied to a zone in another realm.<br>
<br>
When you type /q the same popup window should appear, the numbers should, however, be replaced with check boxes(like the chat filter popup has). The window should say, “Did you have a chance to test the following…” With this in place, you would know what the players deem to be working as intended(Thane buffs) and what received no testing what so ever(relic taking).<br>
<br>
Like I said, I think this is well worth the effort you would put into it. It’s a well known fact that people are lazy, some don’t like to take the time to type out an email or even /appeal a problem. With something popping up in their face, where all they have to do is check a box, I think your testing feedback would increase 10-fold. <p><b>Vendrix</b><br>
