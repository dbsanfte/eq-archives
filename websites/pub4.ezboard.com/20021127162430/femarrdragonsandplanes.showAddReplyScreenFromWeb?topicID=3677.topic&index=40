I'm not sure if you're serious or what, so take this with a grain of salt if you're just kidding... otherwise:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> What you guys don't get is... well... your time is over. It's the next generation's turn to define what is... well... everything. Take your seat in the back and bitch and moan about how much better it was when you were a youngster. It's human nature for each generation to think itself superior to the one / ones that come after it. You hear that all you &quot;punks&quot; from back in the day? You're another cog in the machine. It's time you got out of the way.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
You speak with the arrogance (ignorance) of youth.  Which we all have and it's healthy - to a point.  Every generation does it, right?  So youth is just as much a cog in the so-called machine.  In fact it's the most catered to of the 'cogs'.  Everything that 'was' punk and the evolution thereof is just another facet of our multifaceted culture.  When the local mall starts carrying the garb of your movement then you know your movement is dead.<br>
<br>
The whole point is that what was punk is no longer counterculture (be it in music, style or demeanor).  It's been assimilated.  The rebelliousness of today must find new ground to stake it's own - and this isn't about better or worse, one generation vs another.  The simple truth is that rebellion by it's very nature must fight against the popular norms.  Punk (style, music, &amp; demeanor) is now a popular norm.<br>
<br>
So saying &quot;Punk is dead&quot; is NOT the same as saying &quot;Rebellion is dead&quot;.  It's just the 'punk' ground is too well trod and bloodied.  The new rebellion must move to a new, more fertile battlefield if it truly is trying to be rebellious.  Otherwise it's just a bunch of posers that have no style, music or demeanor (voice) of their own.<br>
<br>
Ceru<br>
<br>
PS - In all honesty I think the only true rebels are those that forget society or lose track of it to go their own pace/route.  Most often this mentality is typified by eccentricity (academians lost in their ivory towers, farmers on their tractors, etc.) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/utumyetotoeslasher.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tumyeto Toeslasher</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 835<br> <font color=#E9D756>(9/27/02 1:10:17 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3677.topic&index=45>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> I'll take a stab at this one.</span><hr size=1> I'll take a stab at this one.<br>

Punk, In my opinion is a whole bunch of people who could give a flying fvck what people think, care and say about them.<br>
<br>
To call your self &quot;True Punk&quot; and starting a thread about how it pisses you off that people are saying that they're punk is poser.<br>
<br>
If you were a real punk you wouldn't give a fvck what they say, if they wanted to be punk fine. You would have nazis to beat up, girls to fvck and beer to drink, instead of worrying about posers.<br>

Punk as the self proclaimed representative of "the rebel" against a conformist society? Heheheh, I was a teenager during the late 70s and knew hardcore "Punks". Those who are gainfully employeed today (that I know of) don't remotely look "Punk". <br>
<br>
Really, I don't get why some people today dress punk. That statement is ineffective because the people viewing punks have either been there done that or watched it's hey-day in the 70s.<br>

Dress like Elvis of the 70s.

For me, &quot;punk&quot; was mainly centered around the music. I won't lie and say I didn't &quot;look&quot; punk.  The music was a medium to express the hypocrisy and injustices of society and goverment. The majority of the bands that I listened to (e.g., Crass, Faith, MDC, Dead Kennedys, Bad Religion (when they were interesting), et al.) were didactic.  The composition of the melody was secondary, the message was primary. There were a few bands that were able to balance the two...with the analog technology of the time.<br>
<br>
I never would have imagined a philosophical debate on punk...sitting in my freshman History class in high school (~1983), one of a few classes where I actually showed up. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   This is *not* to say I've been a &quot;punk&quot; longer than you have, so if you were a punk later blah. /bonk <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>
<br>
I do see your point about the hypocrisy of BEING punk. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   One day at lunch, towards the end of my freshman year, it did dawn upon me.  I remember it well.  I laughed as I looked around because in our efforts to BE different we were homogenous.  We were a clique that was no different from the kids that played D&amp;D, those who played cards, the stoners, etc. Albeit our way of rebelling was to dye our Ralph Lauren sweaters and rip out Izod logos, etc.  Sounds kinda funny/stupid.  The image of a family without blemishes was *very* important where we were.  Our interest in punk was in the ideals the music expressed - against injustices be it through capitalism, big government, etc. (of course, all while living under our parents' roofs <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> )<br>
<br>
Anyway, I stopped &quot;looking&quot; punk the following year, after hanging out with my friends in San Francisco (yes, they listened to punk/hc also)...some of their friends were &quot;living the punk life,&quot; as I interpreted it then. Some were squatting, actively participating in rallies, etc.  I felt trivial. Over the years, as I visited with them in SF for the summer, I saw them create families and some die. The glazed over idealism and fighting at every step faded away by the second year of college.  Damn those take-home midterms. *raises fists* <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
If I had kept up the fight, I am sure in my old age <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I would be looked at the same way older '70's activists impressed upon me when I was in high school. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>

Punk is more of a way of thinking... has nothing to do with your style, your music or anything.<br>
<br>
A punk is someone who does his own thing with utter disregard for everyone else. These days most of the punks out there are actually &quot;Rappers&quot;... guys doin there own thing, being stupid, and causing problems.<br>
<br>
Next time someone says they are a punk, ask them how many ppl they have jacked wallets from, how many cars theyve stolen, how many houses theyve robbed, the last time they woke up in a dumpster with some cracked out hooker they met at a show the nite before.<br>
<br>
BIG difference between a punk and an individual and a freethinker. Punk has been glorified so much that ppl think its cool to be a punk these days, Most real punks from the late 70s early 80s dont look back and think &quot;ahhh, those were the days&quot;, they look back and think &quot;Did i actually @#%$ that hooker in the back of that stolen pontiac in mexico?&quot;...<br>
<br>

Even my idols have made bad music. The Church's Sometime Anywhere disc and The Cure's Wish disc generally blew in a major way. <p><div align="center"><a href="http://www.ulujain.org">

And see that's where the difference falls in.  When you try to stop letting people into your scene because you think they don't deserve it for one reason or another, it's not &quot;YOUR&quot; scene anymore.  What do you want a bet that the emo kids in the scene where you are actually LIKED some of the &quot;mainstream&quot; bands before they became &quot;popular&quot;?  Once a band takes off it becomes almost cool to try to be &quot;underground&quot; and reject them, even if you liked them before.  I don't do this, I think it's retarded, I like what I like regardless of who else likes it for what reason.  I still don't watch MTV or listen to the radio but... if you really want to know about that listen to The Ataris, they'll tell ya why!<br>
<br>
And the goth thing, I figured you were being sarcastic, I was just making sure hehe.  Kids say I'm a &quot;punk&quot; because I have wild spiky hair and wear the tight shirt with the baggy drawz and I have the piercings and all... I really don't care, because I am who I am regardless of what people call me!

Sometime Anywhere was definitely a throwaway album(tho &quot;2 places at once&quot; is a friggin' epic)...as well as 75% of Gold Afternoon Fix and even a lot of Starfish to be honest(I really really can't get over Heydey and the first one though...still love both those entire albums).  <br>
<br>
Off Wish...yea bad album but &quot;edge of the deep green sea&quot; is worth the entire price of the cd. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=46329"><img src="http://www.netwalk.com/~loki/signaturevara.jpg"><BR>60 Iksar Grandmaster<a> - Shackle of Tynnonium - Celestial Fist -<BR>

Oh I won't deny it at all! I used to be a nu-metal kid, before I got into hardcore about a year ago, probably a bit longer. There's always going to be people who make the transition, and just the same, there will always be people who reject mainstream bands.<br>
<br>
Personally I think most all emo sucks, so I just say screw it all :P<br>
<br>
But all the same, I don't care how big Thursday, Blindside, Converge, Poison the Well, In Flames, and AFI get. I'll always like each of the bands.<br>

Haha, we had cops call us goths once. It was great. One of them went on to recall the fact he was a &quot;jock&quot; in high school.
