Our tank pulls about 4 lizzies.  I am in the corner medding up.  The tank's health begins to drop, so I let off a greater heal when he is at 3 bubbles of health.  All the lizard, except for the one the tank is on, runs and beats on me.<br>
<br>
What I would like to know, is what strategies do the more experienced clerics have on agro healing?<br>
<br>
Should I have healed when the tank was at 3 bubbles or waited a bit more, then healed?  Would that have made  a difference?  I understand that when i let off the GHeal, it was if I was doing 300 dmg to all 4 lizards, thus agroing myself.<br>
<br>
Should I have let off a regualr heal first, to not agro the lizards as much, so the tank would have an easier time to taunt off me?<br>
<br>
When the mobs agro on me, should I fight back, or just wait for the tanks to taunt off me.<br>
<br>
Would another solution be to maybe root the other mobs first then cast heal?<br>
<br>
Just a few questions.  I'm sure that there are more floating around in my head.  I would appreciate any help on this matter.  Thank youvery much for your time.<br>

<br>
Welcome to &quot;Why Clerics love Enchanters&quot; 101.<br>
<br>
It is an old axiom in most dungeons that you can't go in deep without a Cleric and a Cleric won't go in without and Enchanter.  Why?  Because the Cleric keeps the party alive and the Enchanter keeps the Cleric alive.<br>
<br>
You have just posted the exact reason why.  What needs to happen in this case is that if the Tank is going to pull mulitple mobs, the enchanter needs to Mez the other ones before you heal the tank.  Or, if the tank is falling real fast, he needs to mez the ones that are on you as fast as possible.<br>
<br>
What, there is no Enchanter you say?  This makes it much more difficult.  <br>
<br>
1.  Make sure the group has a second tank (With Taunt) assigned to do nothing more then pull mobs off you.  He/She is your guardian and MUST pull the mobs off you as soon as possible, then turn back to the main fight.  <br>
<br>
2. Keep both Divine Aura and Divine Barrier Mem'd at ALL times.  I am lvl 55 and have had both mem'd since lvl 29.  Hot Key your Divine Spells and do not be afraid to use them.  Use the Divine, then after mobs have left you alone, click on the flashing Icon and heal who you need to. <br>
<br>
3.  Make sure there is a back up healer (Shaman, Druid) assigned by the group leader to watch your hps.  This is especially important if there is no enchanter in your group.<br>
<br>
4.  If they are unable or unwilling to protect the person that is there to keep them alive, then I would consider finding a new group.  Yes, I know sometimes it takes a while to find one.  But in the long run, you will teach them how to treat a cleric and you will not spend an hour or so trying to get back to your corpse.<br>
<br>
Hope this helps some,<br>
<br>
I am,<br>

<br>
In order for the Cleric to remain alive, there MUST be one of the following...<br>
<br>
1. A Taunt Heavy Group, a group with lots of Melee classes that can Taunt things off the Cleric will do fine with just one Cleric backing them up.<br>
<br>
2. A back-up healer. It's the back-up healers job to do little else than keep you alive if you get agro'd. But this can cause Monsters to run back and forth between healers.<br>
<br>
3. Bring an Enchanter along. Mezzed MoBs have no teeth, You can heal to your hearts content, worst thing that could happen is the one fighting creature could make a run at you. This, of course is based on the skill of the Enchanter.<br>
<br>
<br>
Now, the flip side, here are some things you can do to improve your chances and fun when with different groups.<br>
<br>
1. Let the group know how you will be performing your role.<br>
<br>
2. Let certain key members in your group know what they need to do to help keep you, and thus the rest of the party, alive.<br>
<br>
3. Call Evac when needed (if available) or sound the retreat. You are the one that's best suited to know when it's time to get out (barring the presence of an Enchanter) If it's time to leave, use your Devine Barrier and run. Once again, you can get people to their corpses quickly. A Warrior can buy the party a lot more escape time than a Cleric can.<br>
<br>
If an Enchanter is present, they should be directing all aspects of combat. When there is no Enchanter, that task falls on the Cleric. Both these classes need to let their party know how their mana is doing, when it's good to pull, and when it's not good to pull.<br>
<br>
So it really becomes your job to be an expert combat strategist. Besides, most of the rest of your time is spent looking at a book anyway. So you have plenty of time to master combat strategy. <p><center><strong>

When there is no enchanter, when your enchanter is having a hard time, or when soloing, these two spells will help provide crowd control.  Root one beating on you, then move outside his melee range.  If you are having trouble getting root off, stun one first, then root.  Not as effective as having an enchanter or a taunter, but still a useful trick of the trade. <p>Arrach<br>

<br>
-- Assist the tank, chain stunning - if you have 4 mobs on the tank, now only 3 are beating on him. And if you have a tank targeting the toughest mob [ or the healing mob] (as he should)...your stuns are preventing the most damage at little mana cost, and you wont get aggroed.<br>
<br>
<br>
-- Finnish the target mob off with a nuke. 1 More not beating him up.<br>
<br>
-- root the greenies or low blues and ask the tanks to back away- the targeted mob will follow.<br>
<br>
-- Bob for mana all the time ) i cant tell you how many times i have ended a fight with just as much mana as when we started , just because i took the time to med betwqeen stuns / heals....<br>

<br>
I agree with much that as said already so will not repeat it. One more issue, however, is where you decide to hunt. Some mobs don't take much notice of healers. Others are the opposite extreme, and aggro on healers the first chance they get. Most are somewhere in between. Experienced clerics learn the various mobs you can and can't get away with healing infront of.<br>
<br>
Take two extremes. Fighting Cyclops and Seafuries in OOT, I could CH a Warrior or Mage pet and then med at the mob's feet and it would ignore me once aggro'd on the tank. A cleric's dream. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  If the mob aggroed on anyone, it was the chanter who was nuking cos he was bored LOL. The opposite extreme was ... you guessed it .. Cazic Thule. Those lizzies HATE HATE HATE clerics (or any healers), and you fly up to the top of their hate list as soon as you cast. I found this the absolute worst place in Norrath for this.<br>
<br>
There are various solutions to this. I died there too often around level 30, usually in pick-up groups but also in guild  groups as well, which wasn't much fun, so decided, that absence was the better part of prudence (hehe) and chose to hunt mostly in Paw instead up to 36 or so (far less crowded too at that time). Sure, gnolls are not keen on healers either, but it's easy compared to Cazic (and the people I met there were nice too <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ). Well that was my experience anyway.<br>
