If a gm was there when they said in ooc for everyone else to leave the zone. If that is what they said.<br>
<br>
However, if anyone should be SLed over this it is VI.  They made it so taylors can not level up without farming stuff needed to level.  It is the only trade skill that requires farming to level the skill.  Yes smithing requires critter dropped items too. But you can still level your smithing skill without those critter dropped items. It's just that most stuff would not be worth doing without critter dropped stuff. But you can in fact level the skill without.<br>
<br>
Tayloring is a royal pain to level. And alot of folks just buy the ingredients to combine. I never did as I considered the prices to steep and never having lots of plat to buy stuff anyway. So off to EK I went farming skills and NK for cat skins.  And when I went there not more than 2 or 3 others were in zone also. All you have to do is get the spider/lion first is all. Since there are more where they came from I would just go find another one on track. But with just 2 farmers in zone all the spiders and lion can be dead at once.<br>
<br>
As for exp, I never went to EK to get exp at your levels. Aviaks in SK is better, and so is HH pass and keep, and the dreaded omen (a zone I really do hate). And there are others like Najena (very high exp modifier). <p><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#FF00FF"><b><I>Tsulyra Shadowhawk</I></b></font><br><b>

<br>
Got what I needed.<br>
<br>
The guildmember known as Dandalion has not one, but FIVE alts. Among them is a 51 wizard named Uzzelen. Us guildies refer to him as Uzz.<br>
<br>
Quelian is a new member and has not seen the full name in his time with our guild.<br>
<br>
Therefore, when Raie asked him about Uzgah (WHO IS DANG WELL <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> NOT</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> IN OUR GUILD) and Dandalion, all he had to work with was the prefix &quot;Uz&quot;. So, he accidentally mixed up Uzgah with Uzzelen (Who is an EXTREMELY helpful individual... tried helping me out with my Burning Rapier quest <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START >D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/grin.gif ALT=">D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ANG FIRE GOBBIES!&lt; thank god for Evac).<br>
<br>
THAT is how the connection was formed. A simple mistake by one of our newer guild members.<br>
<br>
Uzgah is NOT a guildmember. His name is just coincidentally similar to one of Dand's alts. Or the main... since we refer to Dandalion as Uzz.<br>
<br>
I'd have a log of the conversation with Quelian, but I'm new to that weird little command.<br>
<br>
Thank you for your attention. Hope this sorts things out.<br>

What this means of course, is that Dandalion and Uzgah are NOT the same person. Period.<br>
<br>
And where Raie got the idea that Uzgah was in the High Guardians, I have no idea.<br>

Then I sold 3 stacks at 40pp each, and then 1more stack at 50pp.   Raie and Jenniver offer 2pp for a stack, after totally irradicating all the Crags in the zone... couldn't even find one for like 30 minutes that's when I started my thread cause I was sick of this shit.<br>
<br>
You guys can't continue thinking logs are tempered, but damn it... there was an issue in that zone, and that issue will probably never leave.  IT's called Common curtosy damn it.  I've hunted things under my lvl's many time, but the moment someone came and asked me if I was camping that area, I told them go ahead and left.  And the Orc belts in the commons were the place in question where I bowed down every time.  Why ?  cause I'm NOT Selfish where I'm going to kill a camp for people that can exp, cause I want factions with Freeport.  That was for my High Lvl Necro, and I really wanted his factions raise quite a bit.<br>
<br>
The biggest problem in this game is those playing not being considerate of others.  And Raie and Jenniver were totally not considerate.  They didn't care for alternatives, Raie lied about having no money and then insults people offering 2pp per stacks.  If their own guild wants to take their side, then I think the leader is showing that the guild is a joke.  I'm sorry for those I might be offended, but like anything else in life.  We are NOT ALONE.  There are always others we affect, and if you don't give a damn... then you're darn selfish, and in this case... a total jerk. <p><b>Diako Kronanta<br>

Those people didn't do anything wrong in your guild.  Read my log, the only tempering I did was removing battles, spells and such.  only kept the zone chats in.<br>
<br>
I can e-mail you my 2 logs (soulsavor and Calistau) and ask your guildy to send you his.  I will bet you $100 that they will match as it goes for zone chat.<br>

     I was killin Crags cause they were way easier exp for my Warrior/Cleric combo than KFC.  Also, way safer...  I kept having some Nasty red gnolls riping into me in SK.<br>
<br>
    2nd reason also for being in EK, I was ALSO putting silk asside for when I was going to build up my own tailor.  Well, I gotta kiss that nice banking asside considering I ended up getting rid of <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> 6 stacks</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> in the hopes to at least being able to exp in that zone, if not get the silk.<br>
<br>
    I have also taken this chance to send a memo to the Developers job bitching at them for not being a bit more considerate as to doing high lvl quests that ends up causing this confustion.  None the less, there are alternatives.   Mostly if you're a port class and can go in all the zones that have spiders to see if you can find silk.   That was ALWAYS the first thing I used to do.  I left Lany's for like 6-8 months, and started anew...  I'm a bit dissapointed in some of the people I've been seeing lately.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><b>Diako Kronanta<br>

<br>
To: Uzgah / Dandalion / Uzzelen / Jerk ( whatever it is you are calling youself now ), the only person being a grief player here is you.  Congratulations, you have made my personal SL at any rate.  Anyone who would stoop so low as to post modified logs and then pretend to be someone else, is someone that I want nothing at all to do with.<br>
<br>
Did Raie, or anyone else that you accused come to the SL submitting you?  No.  With all this new information should someone submit you to the SL now?  Probably.  Will it be me? While I would love to, I don't think it would be my place, however only I control my personal SL, and you are most definatly on it.<br>
<br>
To: Diako, if you can't clearly see that the only one here who was being a grief player was Uzgah / Dandalion / Uzzelen / Jerk ( whatever it is he is calling himself now ), then frankly you aren't intelligent enough for me to even continue this conversation with you. /bye <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rolleyes --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/eyes.gif ALT=":rolleyes"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

     Read my log, and stop being an ignorant.  the only reason you wouldn't want to read my log is cause you don't care for what really happened.<br>
<br>
    I was in that zone, I was the one Raie called an Ass.  I was the one he was chatting with me for most of that discussion.<br>
<br>
    The person you call a Gried didn't enter the discussion until AFTER raie said we can go exp elsewhere, and called someone an Ass.   If you can't clearly see that this guy had an attitude problem, than you're probaly as retarded as he is... cause my log is clear and precise.<br>
<br>
    I love heresay as to who messed with a log, I'll bet you that it's not him that messed with his log.  Raie is lying through his teeth, and trying to save face...  Who' looks like a jerk ?   REad my freaken log, I'll mail it to you.... and stop being an ignorant fool.<br>
<br>
    I have left camps for peopel that could exp, even though I needed to raise factions.  Common courtesy is something some Selfish individual in this game have no notion off.   I love the way some of you distort the truth to fit your own needs.  I'll always agree that Verant set some people up for trouble, but Raie was a jerk.  Again... Read my freaken log, and stop being an ignorant.   After my 1st line he showed his color, then lies... then is being an insulting smart ass offering 2pp per stacks knowing fair well that will never happen.<br>

<br>
Getting attacked at KFC?<br>
<br>
Ummm.  Don't remember getting attacked by them. Not even the escapees.  Have taken my main, warrior, cleric, and chanter through KFC before going Omen or paw.  But they always were in a group. Not just a 2 person thingy. /shrug  I only remember running away from the undead cyclop skelly thingy.<br>
<br>
And I still wouldn't go to EK looking for exp. Simply cause of the fact that is where farmers go to get silks. Even you said that is what you wanted there. Simple fact is everyone over 50 is looking for silks if they never worked on tayloring skill before. And that is where they're going to be.<br>
<br>
Sure there other places like spiders in DL (but there are over 6 groups there hunting spiders verse 3 or 4 individuals running around in EK if that many). And only necros, druids, wizzy, and monks can solo the spiders in DL.<br>
<br>
There is also Lguk bedroom camp for spiders. This is a recognized camp by the players on lanys anyway. There is sol B bugs and bats. Again a recognized camp. And these two camps only a necro or monk (maybe a mage could) could farm for silks solo.<br>
<br>
So it seem pretty obvious that EK is where folks are gona go to farm silks. And every taylor that got their own supplies instead of buying them has gone to EK to farm silks. Why? Because you get more silks off of craig spiders than any other spider. Long before the shawl quest made it manditory that if you wanted to do the quest you needed 158+ tayloring skill. So this zone is even worst for farmers now.<br>
<br>
But don't worry that this will be you last time running into farmers. As many zones are nothing but farmers like sol a, guk bottom, CC, maidens, ect. Even to some extent sol B is farmers only. Its the reason my alts have taken the exp path they did. Not cause I found omen/fm/ot/dl so exciting. But thats where the folks are to get groups with. I guess technically maidens is not farming since even to a 60 almost all the critters are dark blue with an occasional light blue and evens.<br>
<br>
It's the way the game has gone, since the population has shifted to the 50+ toons or their alts. Very rarely will you find a true newbie on their very first toon.<br>
<br>
Don't get me wrong. I don't agree with them saying leave the zone cause we want to farm silks. You is free to stay there and fight spiders too, just like they are. But don't get upset cause they are there trying to get silks also. As long as they don't KS you or make you to leave the zone by being abusive (this by the way can get them in much trouble if a gm witnesses it). Noone is gona see this as a valid SLing.<br>
<br>
Would this apply to someone PLing say at orc camps in EC or WC or HH Keep and refuse to share if they taking all the camps? Or someone camp stealing?  Well spiders in EK are not a camp as they spawn all over the place and wander around. You can call an entire zone a camp. Verse static spawn camps. VI don't recognize camps, but the player base on Lanys does. While the rules say one thing and the gms are always going to do what the rules say. Lanys is a community and folks remember if someone is a camp stealer or tries to monopolize a zone to pl someone. Some folks will take different views as to how serious of a problem it is. It really up to the individual. But because of instances there are 6 names on my personally never help, buff, heal, whatever list. And no I never SLed them either. No reason to as their infractions is just my view of their actions that impacted one of my alts. Or way back when if it was at my main toon. <p><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#FF00FF"><b><I>Tsulyra Shadowhawk</I></b></font><br><b>

<br>
    I agree with you, and many others that EK is probably not the best place to Exp.  I had 1 night with no farmers (first night there), and I got Monster Experience on Crags... and got silk I was stocking up on (which everything I got there is gone now <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ).  I'm in Lake of Ill Omen (was trying to avoid that, but can't deny it's incredible exp... but no money, or nothing really good to stock on.<br>
<br>
    What rubbed me the wrong way is Raie's responce and attitude about it.   I asked if they could lay back a bit so we could get exp... and he flattly said &quot;No, none of us Crag farms can&quot;.  Then read the following of the discussion, and yes... I should be allowed to exp there.  They should be buying it from people exp'ing there as a 1st resort, 2nd would be to go through merchants....  and 3rd, then you have to camp them.   I lvl'ed a Necro, and before I left Lanys I was going from merchant to merchants buying the silks....  I got 10 stacks one night, and did NO hunting.  and my Necro can't port to all the locations Druids/Wizards can.<br>
<br>
    As I mentioned as a broken record, mostly cause he mentioned Freeport factions and the belts.  I HAVE bowed down the camp to people getting exp there, even though I Wanted thos belts for factions.  It happened once that someone Red to me came to the camp and asked me if I was camping it, and I said yes...  I wasn't going to give in to someone else with the &quot;Same&quot; needs.  But I will bow down to those with &quot;More&quot; need than I.  I don't like to feel like I'm causing any chances to remove fun factors for the others that play around me.   And I don't apreciate those that are selfish, and don't seek alternatives before going for the last resort.  Him telling me he's broke, and then offering 2pp per stack (an insulting joke) right after they killed like all the crags... and then saying he's sharing with this other 40+ char to be a smart ass...  Well, my opinion of HIM is Aprehensive as the guy mentioned earlier, and his Guild leader is no better in my opinion.<br>
<br>
We all have needs, in game or in life.   Would you say Screw every one around in Real life and do what you need to do without caring ?  Ah... but EQ is just a game...  so people's enjoyment isn't really an issue most of us should care about.   Sorry, I'm just ticked by people like that.  His actions were &quot;NOT&quot; wrong...  His reaction to my first tell set us up for the debate that shows in this forum today.  Before people tag the poster as a jerk, read my post.

Let me break them down for you.<br>
<br>
Nowhere did Raie or anyone else in the logged portion you have presented, ever state that everyone else had to leave.<br>
<br>
She did say ( and if you would actually read your own logs, you would know this as you highlighted it with bold ):<br>
[Sat Feb 09 11:08:58 2002] Raie says out of character, 'You can exp somewhere else'<br>
[Sat Feb 09 11:09:05 2002] Raie says out of character, 'For silks, everyone knows you come here'<br>
<br>
Uzgah / Dandalion / Uzzelen / Jerk ( whatever he is calling himself now ) is the idiot that started saying that she had said that they had to leave and that she admited to being a grief player ( I can't even guess where that came from ).<br>
Read it for yourself, it's all in your post.<br>
<br>
IF she had said, I'm here now everyone get out, then I would have no choice but to agree with you, but she did not. She pointed out ( as a few others have in this thread now as well ) that there were other places to get exp if he didn't feel he was getting enough ( sure did get alot of exp in that post he made for someone who wasn't getting any exp <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ) in EK. She also pointed out that EK is well know for being a place where people come to get silk.<br>
<br>
Was she a little short with you and the jerk? Possibly, however I have to wonder how much crap in OOC you and the jerk were giving her before the logging began. If you were all giving her stress, I can't say i'm shocked that she reacted like she did, as I would have probably reacted the same way.<br>
<br>
Should she have calmed down and been more polite? Sure, things would have gone alot smother if she had.<br>
<br>
Was she the one that posted altered logs to the SL and tried to make an even bigger deal out of it than it was? No, that would be Uzgah's / Dandalion's / Uzzelen's / Jerk's ( whatever he is calling himself now ), if you want to gripe at someone, perhaps you should start with him.<br>
<br>
Your pity party is pathetic. Uzgah's / Dandalion's / Uzzelen's / Jerk's ( whatever he is calling himself now ) pity party is even more pathetic.<br>
<br>
He stooped to using altered logs, changing his identity, and trying to treat us like we were all stupid, I have no respect for him at all now. <br>
<br>
You on the other hand, I have seem some pretty well thought out stuff from on other boards. On the other hand, I have also seen posts like this where I honestly think you just haven't sat down and thought the whole situation through.<br>
<br>
Take a moment and think before you reply, so that your answer will be well thought out ( also please take your own advice and re-read your logs, leaving your personal bias aside).<br>

Stop attacking the guy that posted the logs and understand common sense. There are thousands and thousands of better ways to approach a situation like that, and the way it was handled was done very poorly. So what, Uzgah called them a loser, he was standing up for the others in the zone that were also hunting crag spiders. So what if Dandalion told people to petition the farmers, the farmers were telling people that they could exp elsewhere and weren't even listening to the alternatives.<br>
<br>
Raie, you kept kidding that you were being selfish, but in reality you kinda were. You were also being snobbish, trying to act like you were higher than everyone in the zone. You can't expect to just walk over people and be well-liked in return. Just because this is the internet doesn't mean your attitude doesn't come back and bite you in the ass like it does in RL.  <p><img src=http://hoseroth.tripod.com/warriorofthepast.JPG></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ulordofchains.showPublicProfile?language=EN>LordOfChains</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>w4nn4b3!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(2/11/02 5:09:16 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumrantsandravesbalancingissues.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1683.topic&index=59>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.mikesfreegifs.com/main1/halloween/batsmoon2.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: My reply</span><hr size=1> One of the things our guild is curious about is in Uzz/Dand/Uzgah's sudden verbosity. He's usually such a nice quiet guy.<br>
<br>
But in these logs, he's talking a lot more than usual. Our best guess is that he's frustrated about something.<br>
<br>
Which may also explain why he modified the logs in the first place <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> (I feel I must add an &quot;If he did,&quot; because its just as easy to deny the content of a log as it is to modify a log)</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->. In which case, it was just a simple mistake, and an apology should be issued. <p>_________________
