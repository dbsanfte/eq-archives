you decide</span><hr size=1> Little background on whats up in other posts.  <br><br>About 2 months ago i started on the Shield of Bane Warding on accident by having the pleasure of the burning prince spawn while i was soloing the platuae in Scarlet desert.  So i take him down and wonder WTF is this thing for.<br><br>Anyways i do some snooping and bingo quest.  <br><br>So i camp the rest of the items with 0 help from anyone in the guild even after asking for help in ME with toilers.  So over the last 2 months i have begged and pleaded for help with the last fights.  Not once did anyone offer to help.<br><br>So while all this is going on i completed my elysian armor set, bought a lodi sheild with money i made collecting making and selling twilight sea armor..  No help from any guild members here either.  So i get to a point in my game carrier that i only need epic to upgrade anything.  So i begin to think, you know i can help this guild by letting them use loot i have obtained with ZERO GUILD HELP.  So i loan a Writ of Innoruuk obtained in a GM event in commons last week to Evelle a high lvl cleric still using some newbie gear and clearly stated in tells and in guild chat that it was on loan until she either upgraded her hear or i needed it back to use as trade stock towards MQ'ing of a epic item i needed.<br><br>Later that evening i log on and do the usual plea for help with the Shield quest for the last 2 fights.  The first fight was completed with VERY nice ppl that were also doing the fight for themselves.  Well what do ya know I get tells from Ghie and Evelle stating they will help me finish the quest and the have a group ready to help..    So when go and do the 2 fights and bingo new shield.  <br><br>So i Camp for the night and and make a post in forums that the Shield and some other items for sale/trade  to help obtain my epic easier.  <br><br>I work long hours and on days off i take care of my 16mo. daughter so raiding really isnt much of an option so i have to get things i need the only way i can, 1. either get lucky and catch a soloable spawn i need, 2. collect and save money and purchase what i need.  <br><br>Now i dont see anything wrong with that but after i log on the next morning I get baraged in guild chat saying that i have no right to auction anything the guild &quot;helped&quot; me obtain.  After a few ugly minutes im /guildremoved.   I give Evelle a tell about the book and she then says that she turned it over to guild officers and that they will not give me my book unless i give them &quot;there&quot; shield back.  After getting jerked around for a while i finally get a response from someone and they now state that Evelle thought you gave it to her for helping with the quest.  Thats interesting seeing how i loaned her the book prior to asking for any help. <br><br><br>So now thats the deal  guildles/epicless/bookless<br><br><br><br>Seolblade Fusion<br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/utrechdashadowknight.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Trech Da ShadowKnight</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 572<br> <font color=#E9D756>(2/25/02 8:53:26 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3088.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: League of Ronin or Nazi elitest? you decide</span><hr size=1> Dunno man.

Yeah he rarly ever offered to do ports when we were gearing up for a raid.  He only made one raid during his time with us (that was a CoM raid where he got a JR for his epic).  Mostly what I saw of him was his /gu asking for help most days on this quest.  Saying how nice it was and how he needed it.  So he finally helps out someone, so they in turn spend a night helping him.  Everyone is happy until they see the very next thing he does is go to sell it.<br><br>I don't think you should complain about your guildmates feeling used because you wanted to fill you bank account.

The reason leadership had not assisted you with your epic was your close to absolute zero participation in guild events.  <br><br>Those two months you spent both &quot;pleading with us&quot; and &quot;getting your full Elysian&quot; were spent by most of your guildmates raiding together and accomplishing things as a team.<br><br>I am appreciative that you have a 16 month old daughter to care for and may not always be able to make raids.<br><br>Just about everyone who plays EQ has time constraints, but you clearly have enough time on your hands to farm yourself a botaload of loots &amp; plats.<br><br>It's fine if guild activities start before you are able to log on, but the fact is, you rarely *if ever* came to raids in progress when you logged in - instead you took a moment to &quot;plead&quot; with help to attain your loots and then went a-soloing.<br><br>Why would LoR leadership schedule an epic progression for you over the guildies who make most events, support their guildmates and don't have the me-first attitude that you do?<br><br>The answer, of course, is that they didn't.<br><br>Again, guilds, at least this one, do not exist merely as a way for you to get your loots.  Support your guildmates &amp; they will support you, not the other way around.<br><br>As for the silly shield, the fact is, like most quests for nicer items, the final steps required help.  Leadership did help you, and several people whom you will never meet in real life spent several hours of their time because you &quot;needed&quot; the item.<br><br>Their hope was that you might start participating in guild activities instead of soloing all the time if the help was provided.  Unfortunately, you went the other way and within 24 hours the item that the all-guild group got for you was posted for sale on these boards.<br><br>You can call all the names you wish, and try to distort all the facts you like, but your actions were selfish and loot oriented, and to come here and refer to LoR as Nazi (Ninnin's Porting aside) is simply absurd.<br><br>Broccolia<br>Revenant - LoR <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uannocstarshield.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Annoc Starshield</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 78<br> <font color=#E9D756>(2/25/02 9:34:17 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3088.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: League of Ronin or Nazi elitest? you decide</span><hr size=1> I have group with Evelle off and on for the past year in such places as OS, KC Chardok and a few others.

My post is based on the assumation that what Seolblade has posted is the way it went down. If somehow that is not the case then I appologize and you may ignore my post most thoroughly.<br><br>First off I am one of those who helped seolblade do the first fight. I did not know him but was there to do the fight for my friend Draelyn and Draelyn had been talking to Seolblade and had gotten information from Seol that helped Drae on the quest so Drae and I were more than happy to help do the fight twice for Drae then Seolblade. <br><br>Now to the part about LoR owning the shield.The guild helped on 1/10th of the quest and he had  by his account asked for help many times before and recieved the standard blank answer most people get when they ask for help in a lot of guilds. If 1/10th of the help is considered ownership then you all are out of your mind. Did the guild help kill the thought leeches for the brains/ toilers for the charcoal/burning priest/camp for approx 6 hours the vah shir heads/first fight of 8 mobs? Nope you helped with a fight that takes 10 minutes and is easily done with 1 healer and 2 tanks above 55 and you claim ownership? This was not a raid where 30 people help kill a mob so that that one person who gets an item is only 1/30th responsable for them having the item. Even though I do not agree that LoR should have any type of ownership of the item I also do not agree with you selling what your guild did help you aquire even if they only did help on 10% of it. <br><br>I speak for myself and not my guild. The opinions I am about to speak bear no markings representing Divine Grace in any way, they are just me speaking my mind.<br><br>Evelle. If you did keep that book and give it to an officer and it was loaned to you till you had better or he reclaimed it if he needed to sell it then I would ask you to do the same and relenquish almost all loot you recieved while in DG that was obtained via any of DG's help. If droppable give it to an officer of DG for reallocation if no drop please destroy 29/30th's of it since you did 1/30th of the work approx. if it was obtained on a raid of any sort be it halls of testing or a boss raid. You could keep 1/30th as 1 out of average 30 people on a raid you did 1/30th the work. If you truely believe in guild ownership enough to take what was loaned to you that was in no way owned by the guild as a way to reclaim an item you all helped about 1/10th to get then you would happily do so out of your own morals. If you do not then you should appologize and get the book back to Seol with much haste and sorrow. As I stated before this is not the outlook of DG but my own opinions. If what seolblade said was true and he loaned you the book and you gave it to an officer of your guild to hold as &quot;Payment&quot; till you all got &quot;Your Shield&quot; back when all you did is 10% of the work for it then you should do the same for your own gear epic/epic pieces etc. and divulge yourself of them.  <br><br>Adarian Silverthorn <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/bemarr.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=crinkle>Crinkle</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 276<br> <font color=#E9D756>(2/25/02 9:47:59 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3088.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: League of Ronin or Nazi elitest? you decide</span><hr size=1> your angry because your guild helped you get something and then you went and sold that item?

The only help you needed with this quest is really with the final two battles. You solod the Burning Priest(of your own accord), the leach brain is also solable(easy mobs), and the the toilers part can be done doing normal exp groups in Maidens Eye. <br><br>The problem with when he asked for help is that it was always while the guild was in TOV or on another raid. <br><br>I don't blame Evelle for keeping the book. She helped you obtain a very cool shield and then logs on the next day to find out you are selling it. Thats not what she helped you for.<br>She helped you to upgrade your equipment.

I am not sure what you are trying to accomplish with this &quot;rant&quot;.  I think most people would be upset with you for what you have done.  You begged and pleaded in guild chat for assistance on this quest(yet the only assistance you have given the guild is on a raid where you had a chance to progress your epic).  When begging for help you kept on telling people how nice of an item it was, if it is so nice then why are you selling it.  After killing the VSR for litel's epic progression, we also looted an extra VS stone that was supposed to go to you for your epic even though you were not present on the raid.(admittedly i am not sure what happened to it after that raid)<br><br>   Adarian,  Please tell me when anyone said anything about &quot;guild ownership&quot; of the shield.  No one in the guild has claimed that the guild owns the shield.  People are upset that he mislead the guild and used guild resources to obtain an item, and less than 24 hours later tries to sell it on a public board.  If we were claiming Guild ownership of anything then we you would see us asking for the JR that he obtained on a guild raid.<br><br>   I dont think that any guild would appreciate or condone Seolblades actions.<br><br>Deckar 59 mage<br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uarikel.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Arikel</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 2412<br> <font color=#E9D756>(2/25/02 11:47:17 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3088.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: League of Ronin or Nazi elitest? you decide</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  You know as a whole i loved that guild, but when someone tries to tell ME what i can/cant do i have a problem.
