What did i do you ask?  I trusted another human being.  I trusted that his word was truthful and that he would keep to our agreement.<br>
<br>
Scenerio:  It's mid day, Im auctioning some stuff and just for shits and giggles i auction a manastone that I am going to be giving to a friend of mine.  Then along comes Soriak, asking the usualy pricing questions common to those to ignorant and feeble minded to read the rest of my auction where I asked for offers.<br>
he asks me if i would let him try the manastone out one or two clicks to see how much mana it gave him each click, and that he would let me hold onto his Blight hammer (which is worth a considerable amount less) so I say ok, this guy doesn't seem like a scammer (what an idiot I am) so I let him use the manastone and he lets me hold his hammer for insurance.  Well lo' and behold Soriak (our good shaman friend here)  goes linkdead, and isn't heard from for a few hours.  I, of corse, petitioned it a few mins after he went LD because I figured something was up.  <br>
<br>
Well to sum it up when he got back he refused to respond to tells and Valtron gets on.  Valtron summons Soriak and myself to the Gm room in QCat. and we procede to have a talk.  Eventually Valtron says he cant do anything because its my word against his and i lose the stone =/<br>
<br>
Please be on the watchout for this guy, he preys on those people kind enough to trust him and takes advantage of your trust.  This is a sad day for me because I have lost the energy i once felt for this game because of the actions of one person.  I will still play, but i wont be the same person <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Soriak buddy this next part is for you:  <br>
   Soriak, did you get pleasure from playing with my feelings?  Did you pop wood when you stole my goddamn manastone?  An item that I bought for my friend.  Why did you do it?  Did daddy ass rape you and you felt the need to take out your faggot agression on someone innocent?  Well guess what, you got your manastone you taint-sucking son of a bitch and I hope you get great joy from the countless hours jerking off that you are sure to have while thinking about what you did to me.  I'll stop for now you cocksucking gimp, but rest assured everyone on this server will know about you and what you have done and oh yea, /rude you drooling product of incest I hope daddy lets in the sheep and gives you something extra special tonight!<br>

He seemed nice enough like Shadoa claimed. So, I told him I had JB legs and asked for a caster item or two. I just did this to find out where he was so I can talk to him face to face to see what kind of person he was.<br>
<br>
I managed to weedle out of him that he in fact does have the manastone and he admitted to doing the &quot;trade&quot; that he claimed was totally honest, but as we have above seen that is total BS.&lt;see above&gt;<br>
<br>
Also knowing Shadoa for 2 years and knowing his character before that I know that he would not make a trade like that. He does almost all my trading for me and I know how much he hangs out in EC. Also he always gets killer trades not POS like a blight hammer for a manastone.<br>
<br>
If anyone knows his alternate characters it would be great if you could post them here. So that everyone else can know what kind of a fucking scumbag is and so they don't get scammed.<br>
<br>
I managed to get out of him that one of his alternates is Janlail(sp?) If anyone knows his class/lvl or knows for sure this is NOT true please post that.  It is entirely possible that he just used the name Janlail, but if not then we have a clue to his higher ups.<br>
<br>
And as Shadoa said, I hope your daddy gives ya something extra special tonight.<br>

I am truly sorry for your loss as I am when ANY honest person gets screwed over. Don't worry, they will get theirs.. this is just a game but no doubt they will screw someone over in real life and that will be too far.<br>
<br>
Just a note however... I find your aggression a bit disturbing. There is nothing funny about a young boy or a young girl being raped and I would think you could find a better way of telling him you hope he gets what he deserves.<br>

The paladin that contacted me in game said Soriak told him my character was his main.  I sent tell to shadoa who told me Soriak had dropped my name to them as well.  And if he told someone else his main is Janlail which is apparently another high level person these may just be attempts to slander the names of honest, nice people.  Please dont accuse anyone until this is 100% confirmed.  It upset me so bad last night after Argis (52 paladin I think it was) pestered me for 30 minutes with tells accusing me of stealing the manastone and lying about who I know and what times I had been online that I had to log off and get away from it all.  Of course it didnt help my case that I went Linkdead mid-conversation with him, and when I logged back on Soriak was on but argis was gone.  He is probably convinced im this guy but oh well, nothing I could do.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   At any rate, I was assured &quot;Your auctions will be watched closely&quot; so i hope my buying spider silk and hq cat pelts doesnt bore those of you he asked to watch my auctions.<br>

I do however, have a question for Argis, you'll be watching Jaladian's auctions closely and what?  Not to be condescending here at all, but what can or will you do?  Report to a GM that Jal is auctioning some piece of gear and what do you think they will do?  GM action has not been impressive, and if they had the type and amount of logs they claim to have, wouldn't they have been able to verify this and correct it?  Your threat of becoming a &quot;big brother&quot; is made hollow by the lax GM re-action.<br>

<br>
When I accused you I probably only spent 10 minutes TOPS talking to you, and you pretty much convinced me you were not the one. He did give out a name close to yours however. <br>
<br>
Also, you made a few things that made me want to try and find out if you were the one. You said you were responding so slowly to me not because you were thinking hard how to respond, but because you were on painkillers. I believe you now but at the time it seemed fishy.<br>
<br>
One last thing. IF you were the one we had already talked to your twink so a straight accusation in game was the only way I could tell.  I never told anyone else about your name except Shadoa and Chobin.<br>
<br>
Actually, I never even knew you went Linkdead because yes I did have to go. No, I'm not convinced your the one and pretty sure you aren't. Sorry for any false accusation but it was the only way to tell. And the thing about auctions was not something I could realistically do, but something I hoped would make him confess. Since I doubt he is the one this is irrelevant. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ubelgarbattlebiztch.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Belgar Battlebiztch</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 26<br> <font color=#E9D756>(5/25/01 3:53:40 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.lof.ukhq.co.uk/classmembers/belgar.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Soriak</span><hr size=1> Just a &quot;Heads Up&quot; before this came to light, a shammy by the name of Soriak talked to a guildmate of LoF and asked if we needed any members.

That is expected and I apologized. Like I said it was the only way to tell. I'm only a little mad because he twisted the facts a little. Said I was pestering for over 30 minutes when wasn't even close. Stuff like that. But I talked to him in game and he read my post and he said he was sorry he got mad and that he understands. I apologized to him face to face also. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ucienyaeq.showPublicProfile?language=EN>CienyaEQ</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 9<br> <font color=#E9D756>(5/25/01 9:36:52 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Soriak</span><hr size=1> I am a member of RoD.

Janlail is a wonderful person who will go out of his way to help friends and strangers alike.<br>

<br>
Picking a name that is similar Jenlail = Jaladian ??? and chatting to them about something they know nothing of is not the way. That may be a show of proof but only used in conjustion with other facts. <p><HTML><CENTER>

Shortly after talking to Soriak. I did a /who all Jala<br>
<br>
I saw that there was this 53 druid on and I remembered Chobin saying something about the guy Soriak had mentioned being a druid. It wasn't just his name I picked him out for.<br>
Chobin was here reallife then left shortly after, so I couldn't ask him about it. Anyway, me and Jaladian cleared it up and everything is cool. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrscammeralert.showMessageRange?topicID=124.topic&start=21&stop=23>2</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrscammeralert.showMessage?topicID=126.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrscammeralert.showMessage?topicID=128.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrscammeralert.emailToFriend?topicID=124.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrscammeralert.threadControl?topicID=124.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/deleteThreadFire.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrscammeralert.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=124.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrscammeralert.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=124.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub4.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="emarrmessageboardrules">Message Board Rules<option value="emarrlinks">Links<option value="emarrupcomingmmorpgs">Upcoming MMOG's<option value="emarrfrm16">The Emarr Quadrant<option value="emarrfrm18">America Under Attack<option value="emarrfrm19">Dark Age of Camelot<option value="emarrgeneral">General<option value="emarrfrm17">Funny Stuff<option value="emarrbazaar">Item Bazaar<option value="emarrscrollsnspells">Spell Bazaar<option value="emarrfrm15">Shiny Things<option value="emarrfrm14">Bargain Basement<option value="emarrdragonsandplanes">Rants and Flames<option value="emarrfrm13">Dragons and Planes<option value="emarrroleplaying">Roleplaying<option value="emarrroleplayingoocforum">Roleplaying - OOC Forum<option value="emarrscammeralert">Scammer Alert<option value="emarrsignaturecorner">Test Forum<option value="emarrreallife">Real Life<option value="emarrothermmorpgs">Other MMOG's</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#E9D756>- </font><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/bemarr>Erollisi Marr, The Queen of Love</a><font color=#E9D756> - </font><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrscammeralert>Scammer Alert</a> <font color=#E9D756> - </font><br><br> <br>
