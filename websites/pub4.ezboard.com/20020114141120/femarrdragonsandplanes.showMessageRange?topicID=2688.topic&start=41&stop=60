that's sweet of you Sage. Gorndax definetly could, and Kerna's got a lot of skill too. Personally i don't think i could muster the manpower anymore, after being so out of the circle for as long as i have. Anyway, thats not my point.<br>
<br>
something deeper is in this argument. General distaste with certain individuals. Guys, i'm not asking you all to let Siilv have it every time, but i am asking you atleast respect her for leading the succesful raid that did take down VS, and earned our spot on the rotation. Without her, who knows...we could just be arguing about the possibility of doing it while the nay-sayers continued to say, well, nay. But one thing is for sure...we can't let this one thing tear everything apart and ruin it for all of us.<br>
<br>
Siilv, Sage, work something out. If you respect the pick up raids, and leaders, i suggest you take it privately to reach an agreement. We don't want to spoil what we've all worked hard for. We can't let personal differences interfere with everyone elses enjoyment/entertainment.<br>

You realize that MF, Magister, and probably a few other guilds on the rotation can take VS with 2 groups or less?  Ohhh, that's bright guys go ahead and screw yourselves out of any chance whatsoever to whichever guild comes up with 2 groups that wander over and beat down this mob until they lose interest in dot fundage / wizzie sticks or just plain giggly smiling whenever he dies in the whole 20 seconds of that fight.<br>

However, follow my logic.  If the pickup slot is going to be FFA, what does any pickup group have to lose by taking the entire rotation FFA?  Over time, you'd have a better chance of getting an occasional spawn if all of the slots were up for grabs, instead of just one.<br>
<br>
We're not taking that drastic step at this time.  We're trying to work within the rotation.  However, it appears that CBA/VP is planning to treat the the spawn as FFA.  That's just not going to work.<br>
<br>
I'll skip over the fairly pointless posts by Crom and Cao.  Siilverain's pals can cheer for them, but those posts really add nothing to the discussion.<br>
<br>

<br>
Actually, I would have posted on the D&amp;P board if you hadn't just claimed the spawn over a week in advance during the Thanksgiving weekend.  I wouldn't have contacted you individually in game unless you responded to that post.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> However, back to my original question -- Why is it my job to ask you, Kerna, Jamster, Kalahari, Jexilia, Gorndax, Neville or Gravethumb etc. etc. etc. if any of you are interested in running the upcoming VS raid? It seems to me, it would be much more efficient had you contacted me (refer to above suggestions).<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Why do you think we need to come to you for permission?  CBA/VP is not in charge of the pickup slot on the rotation.  If you wanted to take the spawn, all you had to do was post something on D&amp;P saying, &quot;I plan to take the next VS spawn unless someone else speaks up.&quot;  That's what I was planning to do.  Instead, you just claimed the spawn.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Second, where do get the idea my permission is required? My raid didn't even create the pickup slot, where would I have any control over it? Where have I made it sound as if I controlled this spot? Examples, not inferences please, would be appreciated.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
See above.  You seem to believe that everyone else has the burden to come to you, and that it is your spawn unless they do.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Now that your interest has been expressed, why don't we start working towards a solution for pickup slot rotation? Or do you wish to continue this pointless arguement? <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
The solution is simple.  See above.  <br>
<br>
And don't whine to me about the pointlessness of this argument.  You brought this dispute to Rants and Flames, and your pals and your husband launched into unprovoked personal attacks on me and Tormentcia.  I've lost a lot of respect for VP because of the number of cheap shots that have been hurled our way by its members.  As for Crom . . . well, Crom is Crom.<br>
<br>
There is obviously a need for a rational public discussion of this issue.  So far, you and Theo are the only people from CBA/VP who have posted anything other than mindless  rants and personal attacks.  So let me pose the question to you and Theo once again: is CBA/VP going to treat the pickup slot as FFA, or are you going to communicate with everyone else before you claim it? <p>Sagemon Prayeth<BR>

   Please tell me where I took a cheap shot?  I don't mean that rudely at all.  I really want to know.  I have a few very good friends in Inferno's Hand and have always considered you good folks.  <br>
<br>
   My only problem is that I know Siilver and she genuinely wanted to discuss this with you privately and work something out.  From my standpoint, it seemed you jumped the gun a bit and posted out of frustration and irritation instead of taking a deep breath and saying &quot;Perhaps I should discuss this with Siilverain&quot;<br>
<br>
   VP/CBA does not want to &quot;steal&quot; the pick-up slot.  I believe we were just trying to preserve the slot period.  <br>
<br>
   I honestly think this can be worked out.  I, personally, do not wish to lose any friends, allies, what-have-you over a rotation slot.  <br>
    <br>
    I am not slamming you, flaming you, accusing you, etc.  I have yet to have any problem with you or any of your guild members.  Malamber and I are friends from way back.  <br>
<br>
   Let's keep the peace folks.  I'm sure we can all work together on this and it appears to have gotten way blown out of proportion and reached a level that it never should have in the first place.<br>

That seems kinda silly to me. It is after all a pickup slot so no matter who the leader is you can still go on the raid (provided you haven't pissed them off). If I decided I wanted to go do VS and sign up for a pickup raid it doesn't really matter who is leading it. While any raid leader will favor taking friends over complete strangers it doesn't mean I wouldn't be taken into consideration. If for some reason they have enough Enchanters I could always go the next pickup slot, or maybe beg my way into one of the Guild raids (since I am obviously not in the rotation in anyway it would not Break any rules).<br>
<br>
The fact is if you post a pickup raid for VS you will have mostly the same people sign up. Those who have something to gain from VS(whether it be loot or the experience) and their friends. <br>
<br>
The VS pickup slot was first come first serve I thought. Siilver posted a week in advance she would run the raid, and a week is really not much time. She beat you too it, if you had wanted to run the pickup raid you should have posted you did, not bitched when someone else beat you to it. Given that you have a month for each pickup slot to plan you had plenty of time to post your intentions of running the raid before she did. And I am willing to bet after she posted she would run it if you had sent her a tell requesting to run it in a civilised manner she would have given you a shot.<br>
<br>
Making threats about breaking the rotation is stupid. The people who benifit most from the rotation are those smaller Guilds who can take VS on their own but cant mobilize on him that fast. Sure Breaking the rotation now may seem easy, the guilds look at it and say well we have 24 hours (or whatever the time you have to kill him in is) to take down VS, why should we rush. But as soon as that rotation goes FFA you will not see another VS. While you are sitting at the zone trying to get all your friends together to go take him down one of the bigger Guilds will already have their two groups on the way, and will have taken him out before you can even get half the people you need. What are you gonna say then? &quot;OH I saw it first!! Granted I dont have the pople here to take him out yet but he is mine because I saw him first!&quot; You are kidding yourself if you think you can organize faster than the larger Guilds. And if VS is FFA dont start whining when the guilds wont let you have VS because you were sitting at the zone trying to get people together.<br>

You might lose all your chances altogether.  I've said it before and I'll say it again.  You may be able to organize your pickup raid faster than a guild sometimes, but faster than all the guilds everytime?  Doubt it.  <br>
<br>
I don't doubt that pickup raids get things done, I just doubt they could win a race against every single guild if it was indeed FFA.  Sorry if that sounds elitest, but the guilds in the rotation have been together for awhile and are usually good at communicating and organizing since they know and have played with each other so often.  A guild generally has a website with a message board to let all it's members know what they're doing and when.  Also, I know in Affliction, we'd hang out in IRC a few before the server was supposed to come up so we could all log in together as soon as they did.  A guild has guildchat with which it can communicate with the entire guild in one medium.  What does a pickup raid have?  Groupchat and /tells. <p><a href=http://www.afflictionguild.com/profile.php?username=Carathos&charactername=Carathos>Carathos Ollathir<BR><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/bthedruidsgrove> 60th Druid<BR> <a href=http://www.afflictionguild.com/>~Affliction~</a>

<br>
That's a joke sagemon and you know it, I'm actually pissed at YOUR and torms conduct towards me. <br>
<br>
When someone is a part of something for a long time, and that is with a group of &quot;friends&quot; in my book that person should deserve a little respect, whereas on that occasion recently I was shown none whatsoever.  And then the next time I come along and I'm treated by torm like something she stepped in, I'm sorry but that's not a way you treat someone you called &quot;friend&quot; for any length of time unless you never really meant it<br>
<br>
I stood by both of you many times cause I considered you my friends against people who were shitty to you both, and how do I get repaid? When someone is shitty to me I'm told to shut up and get over it? Frankly I don't think that's on, and if you treat any other people you call your friends like that you'll run out of them fast.<br>
<br>
I don't have any need for bridges or friends that treat people like that, I always though better of you than that and it surprises me, torm surprised me though not as much.<br>
<br>
I remember when I was going to quit the game, and torm and you asked me lots not to go, was this just because you wanted to get one up on Darmu at the time? Or so you could shit on me more later on?<br>
<br>
Do whatever you want to do, but I'll be quite happy elsewhere, you obviously have all you need for your raiding party now and my usefulness has come to an end, anyone else your gonna chuck out soon?<br>
<br>
Trying to get a rise out of torm since that happened? I have not spoken to her since your &quot;dismissal&quot; of me at your hate raid, I've posted nothing about torm at all, not since this morning when I said you cant argue with her cause she's always right, which is true and also seams to be the case with you, you wont admit that you were ever wrong.<br>

Just like now, its the world against you, but what would have been so hard about posting your interest in doing VS?  Would it not make sense for people who are interested in doing something to be the people who make the initial move to get in on something?  You cant jump up and down and complain that you were not &quot;asked&quot; if you wanted to do something when noone has challenged the VS pickup slot before, if you do something and do it again and noone else expresses and interest in doing so, you'll prolly carry on doing it till someone says &quot;wait a mo, can I have a shot please?&quot;.  What the worst that can happen? You wait a month and CBA/VP do one more before its rotated?  I'm pretty sure that if a guild wanted to enter the rotation and they put their hand up wanting to go in it, they would not get the next VS pop, they'd get put at the end of the list so its just spread out and everyone gets their next one without being put back. <br>
<br>
But of course I'm wrong your right as always, noone else's opinions matter on anything <br>

However, follow my logic. If the pickup slot is going to be FFA, what does any pickup group have to lose by taking the entire rotation FFA? Over time, you'd have a better chance of getting an occasional spawn if all of the slots were up for grabs, instead of just one.&quot;<br>
<br>
Nooo... over time, you'll have a near 100% chance of being cut out of any and all VS spawns when the stronger guilds just swoop down and snag him.  Seriously, do you understand how easily some of these guys can take down a mob like VS?  Pre-Kunark two guilds were able to completely cut everyone out from Naggy and Vox.  They can do it far more easily with VS, and if there's no rotation there's no reason why they shouldn't.<br>

<br>
1. Sage, I'm not going to repeat the arguements of anyone here. You are obviously so frustrated with the situation (as we all are) that argueing a point is not, going to get us anywhere any time soon. <br>
<br>
2. I would also like to point out the manor in which the parties have posted themselves in. Sage your threatning to turn VS into FFA. While CBA/VP are in no way trying to step on toes here. <br>
Myself personally I have been on enough failed pick up raids to understand that the demeanor of the leader is a tell tale sign of what is going to happen if the raid fails. <br>
<br>
3. We are going round and round stating our intentions here.<br>
And not making any headway. I am sure that everyone involved at this point has good intentions to keep the rotations on the up and up. <br>
<br>
4. If it's one thing that seperates the human race from the animals it's our ability at compromise when in the face of diversity. So everyone take a step back, breathe deep, take your lumps like an adult, and work something out. there is no further need for argueing your postion on this matter you made it abundantly clear to all where you stand on this matter.<br>
 <br>
5.The question here is. Is anyone here willing to take the first step to come to a peaceful solution instead of adding to frustration?<br>

It happens, and when it does, it needs to be cleared up and seen through if people wish to preserve their relationships. We share this server together, we've not had beef before, and so in my view we have a relationship that is in my mind worth defending.<br>
<br>
For whatever reason, and without blame, we had a communication mix-up. That mix-up proved to have consequences.<br>
<br>
There's no reason, in my mind, why good people can't get through something like this if they can find the medium and safety to communicate effectively.<br>
<br>
For better or worse, we're doing that here, in this thread, in this forum. So please folks, let's show what kind of people we are and wade through this and get some closure. Getting upset, no matter how valid our reasons are, just won't help.<br>
<br>
That said, let me take this space on your screen to focus on my view of where we're at here.<br>
<br>
Politics and diplomacy don't exist to serve their own ends. A lot of folks seem to lose sight of this. It's for bridging the gaps between people who don't see eye to eye.<br>
<br>
This is not a miscommunication between pick-up raiders. The miscommunication is between pick-up raid leaders. I'm sorry that pick-up raiders are watching it fly, as it were; but this is an opportunity to work it out and make it productive. Let's use it.<br>
<br>
Having a rotation of pick-up leaders to take turns for the VS pick-up slot may seem like porkbelly redundancy, but if it serves the purpose of keeping debate from happening, maybe it should be considered.<br>
<br>
Barring a rotation, I am hearing from Sagemon that a courtesy system between pick-up raid leaders would be useful (in his mind crucial) to preserving the spirit of the pick-up slot. Let me take a step back now. This is the first time that this issue has come to light, and I think we can all be forgiven for being a bit surprised by it and for finding ourselves unprepared for it.<br>
<br>
Now, let me address one of Sagemon's concerns<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> That begs the question: what do you consider to be the rules established by the community in securing a slot? Siilverain and some of your guildmates seem to believe either (1) that there are no rules, and that the pickup slot is FFA, or (2) that the proper way to obtain a slot is to ask Siilverain's permission. If CBA/VP is taking either of those positions, the system is not going to work.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
For better or for worse, the current rules for obtaining a slot on the rotation is to gather a raidforce and successfully bring down VS at a time in between the slots of the rotation guilds. Yes, this sparks the term &quot;KS&quot; and I find that personally distasteful. I'm banking on our credibility to avoid ruffling feathers, and my personal idea was to seek the permission of a rotation guild to gun for a slot when the time comes. By definition, that means in my mind that ganking the pick-up rotation is not an option, since there is no point of authority in the pick-up community to seek that permission from.<br>
<br>
Which is a very convenient segue to the second point: I have not and do not see Siilverain taking a position whereby her permission is needed to lead the pick-up slot. I simply am not seeing that, expressly or implied. We have a communication snafu, nothing more. I hope we can set that boundary and work inside it.<br>
<br>
At the same time, to continue on my point of personal character, I think we should also acknowledge that the pick-up rotation exists in no small part due to Siilverain's effort. This is my big point here in the face of mistrust. In my mind, Siilverain has earned that credibility many times over. She worked to secure the pick-up rotation, yet does not hold herself as lord/lady of it. This speaks volumes about her character as a person, and if anyone needs a reason to believe in the innocence and fair principles of her intentions, here it is.<br>
<br>
She didn't know that another pick-up leader wanted to lead VS. I believe that. I think there is reason why everyone else can too. If you can, then maybe you can have some faith that she had no intention of ganking anyone. And I promise you, when I did VS the last time around, I had no intention of ganking anyone either. And I honestly didn't know that anyone else wanted to do it. Siilverain asked if anyone wanted to do it, no one responded, she couldn't make it, I picked up the ball.<br>
<br>
Truth be told, I took leading VS as a duty, not as a particular pleasure. The VS battle has a very very very small sweet-spot, and if it comes off right, the whole affair seems simple and anti-climactic; and when it goes wrong it just all goes wrong and the raid party has to rez and rebuild each time. Not my particular idea of fun raid leading.<br>
<br>
I think we have a honest miscommunication here. The &quot;sideline noise&quot; is just that. Sideline noise. When parties square off in public, crowds gather, people talk. It happens.<br>
<br>
I have faith that if we can see this as an honest miscommunication, and move forward based on the issues raised, we can strike some kind of fair and equitable agreement.<br>
<br>
I am committed to doing whatever is best to preserve the spirit of the pick-up rotation, and will submit myself to either a rotation of the rotation, or a courtesy system, or whatever is decided upon as the most equitable solution.  Personally, I have no designs on leading VS unless the pick-up rotation is in danger of falling through.<br>
<br>
Striking that solution does require us to keep cool heads and work through it.<br>
<br>
I've served under several pick-up raid leaders, and had several of them on my raids as well. Fun times, good memories. I hope to have more of them. Let's not piss that away here.<br>

Bottom line -- I'm open to discussing a rotation within the pickup slot.  Converse with me as an adult and in a mature manner and I'm sure we can work something out. Or this can continue, your choice Sagemon.<br>

Why you should shut the fuck up:<br>
if you wannt cause problems, such as you are right now, and pretense the &quot;inevitable turn to FFA,&quot;  you think there's a chance in hell that you'll EVER get a chance to even smell VS? You run pick-up raids. Why the fuck would a distinguished guild such as Magister, MF, DG, UI, PC, Affliction, etcwait more than 5 1/2 seconds so you guys can shoot a /tell to Random_Tank_1 so you can try VS, even though all you have is 1 enchanter who isn't high enough to cast Rune V and about 6 clerics so that you can heal the main tank?<br>
I mean really. Get a friggin clue. You're at the bottom of the food chain. Not saying you have no rights, but quit squabbling before Big Brother comes around and tells you how it's going to be to stop the petiless squabbling: no pickup spot, guilds have 1 hour to kill VS before it goes to next spot in rotation, meaning he's up for about 3 minutes.....sucker<br>
