I cannot back this with facts but merely an example you can possibly relate to.<br>
<br>
An aquaintance I know. Lets call him Bob to protect his identity. He's one of these people that can't hold a job down, a) because he's not the sharpest tool in the shed b) he really doesn't want to work but the DSS ( Department of Social Security ) make him look for a job and unavoidably sometimes he gets them. Typically Bob will leave jobs because of an accident at work which puts him on the sick for 6 months, or because he left due to problems with his boss ( boss disciplines him, Bob gets angry and quits )<br>
<br>
Bob is always telling people that he's look at this new job which will make him rich and get him a BMW within 6 months. Bob lives in a council house ( owned by the local government ) has his rent paid for him, which he does not look after. Bob has got his equally thick and waste of space girlfriend pregnant twice in the last 3 years and yet between them they cannot look after the girls eldest child properly.<br>
<br>
Im 2, my GF 32 and we both work full time jobs whilst looking after her 6 year old that has been living with me for 5 years now. We are both responsible parents who look after her well, discipline her properly and because of that my little one is flourishing.<br>
<br>
As much as I love her I would like a little boy of my own lineage but the problem is that if my GF gets pregnant we lose 1/3rd of our income which we cannot live without. We both have debts that stem back to our education which we are paying off but we need that money.<br>
<br>
Conversely if Bob and his girlfriend get pregnant, the council will increase their benefit which I do not qualify for because my income is higher.<br>
<br>
This is happening right across the UK so Im sure its happening elsewhere. We are encouraging stupid, lazy people to breed with each other whilst responsible hard working people cant afford to. With a  very fundamental basis of genetics being applied, stupid people will breed more stupid people. The sitting at home example these new stupid people are being set leads to them being lazy as well.<br>
<br>
It is my theory that stupid people are mutliplying whilst intelligence is being bred out. It's very much like Prima Nocte. <p><CENTER><A HREF="http://ak.lonelygamer.com">

<br>
Somewhere there is a couple or a barren woman that is crying to the heavens asking why was this woman blessed with 2 children when she cannot even have one. <br>
<br>
These are times when my faith is pushed to the limit. Why did this have to happen? I am sickened at times like this to be human. How do people even get to this point of carelessness?

Time to go read Calvin and Hobbes or watch old Foghorn Leghorn cartoons. help me get back to a happy place. <br>

For those of you with Children than love and provide for them God Bless you. For those of you that were touched or angered or disgusted with this story Bless you for the capacity to feel for these children. Indifference to the suffering of others is a crime unto itself. <br>

We automatically take our purse/wallet in even if it's just a quick run but some think it's ok to leave a child/children in the vehicle since nothing could possible happen to them since we won't be in the store long. I'm just saying (also this was an opinion of a mother on Oprah =), the contents of a purse/wallet are replacable but children are not. <br>
<br>
Granted that a few minutes in a vehicle will most likely not kill one due to dehydration but there are still mentally disturbed individuals out there as we all know. I would just rather be extreme to take the time to let my son out (since I do have the child safety door lock on at all times) and have him with me for the few minutes I am in the store and have that peace of mind. Even if I can see the car through the windows of a 7-11, what good is that going to do me if someone did take my son when I am inside. I am not faster than a speeding bullet nor can I most likely fight off a person who may possibly have a weapon or twice my size.<br>
<br>
I agree that most parents would do anything to protect their children. There are some that don't think of the consequence for example the mother in this thread. In her case, her negligence cost her her children's lives. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uneebbo.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Neebbo</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 178<br> <font color=#E9D756>(7/3/02 8:58:48 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3449.topic&index=24>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: re. </span><hr size=1>   What that woman did was sick and disgusting.

It's a fairly new idea, related I believe to lowered birth rates as more of society has become affluent and educated and gotten access to birth control. It's also been abused in all sorts of attempts to restrict adult freedoms &quot;for the children&quot;. <br>
<br>
  Children are important. They need and deserve attention, and lots of it, as long as you don't give them an ego the size of Texas. My child gets a lot, but nowhere near all my free time, because she isn't the center of the universe, and I need time to goof off too. She has way too many toys, gets spoiled at times, disciplined at others, and is undergoing what I consider an 18+ years weaning from her parents. I don't know if my way is &quot;right&quot;, but I will continue to remind myself that my child is not my religion.<br>
<br>
  I'd still probably jump in front of a car to save her, but I'm never telling her that.

<br>
The children don't come with an instruction manual, or a &quot;Dummies guide to good parenting&quot;.  Good parenting only comes from a loving commitment by the parents to do their level headed best.<br>
<br>
The lady (too kind a word) from Detroit failed her children in the most miserable way with such tragic results.  What will happen to her is now up to the courts.  Does that fill me with any satisfaction? Not at all, for reasons to many to mention.<br>

I'm sure many parents including me often wonder if &quot;my way&quot; is right.  It's a part of the many questions we ask ourselves daily when raising our kids.  Raising children is not an easy task, and I do not think there is one right way to do it.<br>

<br>
The word &quot;probably&quot; in that sentance really makes me wonder. I would in a heart beat jump in front of a car, bullet, train, anything to save my childs life.  I wouldn't have to think twice either.  I'm responsible for their lives, and their safety. The day I had a child, is the day my life became secondary.  No questions asked that child life IS more important than my own.<br>
<br>
You can call it motherly instincts, or you can call it common sense, I could care less really.  Make the best of their home lives, they are our future!<br>

<br>
When you accept the commitment to bring life into the world, you accept the responsibility of raising that life to be strong and healthy, in all ways.<br>
<br>
That doesn't mean spoiling the child or doting on it. It means that your first and foremost responsibility in life is not your self but that child. Everything you do, you do because it contributes to the welfare of your children.<br>
<br>
You have a responsibility to be a role model and to provide for that child. You have the responsibility to educate that child in the matters of life.<br>
<br>
You don't have to spend every waking minute tending to your childs needs, but at no time should a parent put their own desires ahead of the childrens needs. When it comes to the parents needs versus the childrens needs, I believe children come first. But, some of the parents needs coming first are closely enough related to the childs welfare that the parents needs are the childrens needs.<br>
<br>
Parents do need time to goof off. They do need time away from the children. They do need to maintain their careers so they may provide for the children. <br>
<br>
And if you think that parenthood ends when the child turns 18.../sigh. Parenthood ends when the parent dies. Your responsibilities as a parent continue for the rest of your life. <br>
<br>
If you do the first 18 years right, though, the responsibilitys beyond that point will be much fewer and far between, and you will probably even be able to expect your children to care for you when you become feeble. Do the first 18 years wrong though, and that child will either be a burden on you or on society.<br>
<br>
Putting your children first means always being aware of them when they are around you. Considering them when you get out of the car. Considering them when you get into the car. Taking an active role in raising them and no, bringing home a pile of toys is not raising them.<br>
<br>
I hope I misread your points in your post. I really do. <br>
If not, then you made the wrong choice in becoming a parent.<br>

Also, WHY is a child's life worth more than mine? Yes, I know most people will misinterpret this, but I can have another child. I contribute to society, in theory. A child doesn't (although as my little girl grows she touches more and more people with her charming ways). Let's put it another way: what do you do if you have 4 children? 8 children? 12? Each child is all important, but you obviously can't put them all &quot;first&quot;. Your reasoning would have the parents be the 13th and 14th most important people. <br>
<br>
  Let's face it, it's emotion and ideas stemming from that which state that your child is everything. I don't agree intellectually. Therefore I won't win the argument, since I've never won an emotional vs. intellectual argument yet, given that &quot;winning&quot; usually comes at too high a price.<br>
<br>
<br>
  Ghie, i did say 18+. I'm going to encourage my child to be independent, and not rely on me too much when she becomes an adult, except for unwanted advice from Dumb Ole Dad. WHY oh WHY is it &quot;children come first&quot;? Babies come first, oh yes they do, and for good reason. What does it mean exactly, they come first? They get first dibs on food? They get more new clothes than they need, or just that they get essentials if you have to choose? <br>
<br>
  I think I'm mostly arguing against the mindset and excesses of that philosophy. My child gets her discipline, gets her playtime with daddy, gets attention and food and clothing and I've given up lots of activities as a parent. She is considered the best behaved kid by everyone for 4 years, vexing her parents terribly, who know better. She already has multiple boyfriends at 4 (/boggle), that is boys who come up and hug her and do things for her, as well as a lot of friends in general.<br>
<br>
  Glancing back at your post I think the question is over needs vs. wants. I can't remember the pyramid of needs from psychology, but I'm arguing that at some point on that pyramid below self actualization, the parent can say &quot;enough&quot;. <br>
<br>
  I would never leave my child in a car like this lady, though I don't agree that leaving a kid somewhere fairly safe (locked home) for a short time should always qualify as a crime. I've never done that to my little girl, but I was a responsible &quot;latchkey&quot; kid when I was a young teen, despite being unable to drive to hospitals or put out fires with my super-breath. That level of &quot;constant supervision&quot; and over protectiveness bugs me. Hello, kids (not babies) sleep for 8 hours at a time unsupervised, unless you watch them 24 hours a day somehow. My kid is way too young to leave alone, but I'm going to be teaching her self sufficiency as soon as she's capable, and not because I won't be there. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ufiesti.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Fiesti</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 99<br> <font color=#E9D756>(7/3/02 1:19:51 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3449.topic&index=29>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Mom Who Left Kids in Car Has Criminal Past</span><hr size=1> Where to start hmmm...<br>

I'm disgusted with the quote above.  You act as if a child, is a play toy, if it breaks oh well you can always buy another.  The woman in the car probably thought the same thing, oh well I'll just have more. Your theory isn't any better in my opinion.

I am sure you do contribute to society, but what you have left to contribute can not compare to the many years your child has to contribute.  <br>
<br>
A child contributes to society the moment it is born, not many things can turn a grown mans heart to mush than to see his child being born or the bond that &quot;Most&quot; mothers feels the minute they give birth to that little life and it grips her fingers.<br>
<br>
I have to say that at 32 I have nothing behind me that makes me nearly as proud as my 2 children.  They ARE my contribution to society.   I have bestowed them with all my love, my morals and beliefs.  Because I think I have done a Wonderful job raising my children that they will go out in the world and better the world.  <br>
<br>
Those two will do more than I have by leading upscaled lives, working hard, standing up for rights of themselves and others and working to achieve a better place here.<br>
<br>
Children are our best contribution to society as long as we responsible parents raise them well.  Teach them right from wrong and give them self esteem and strength from with in themselves.<br>
<br>
My children come before me, they always will.  There are times when I must say no to things, ground them, spank them or send them too their rooms, but their needs far outweigh my needs.  I can go with out food and understand, they can not.<br>

Just a little too selfish for my tastes. But that is my opinion.<br>
<br>
Yes if you have 12 kids you are the 13th most important person.<br>
<br>
Your child at 4 will contribute far more to society than you will at 20 something...<br>
<br>
However, you appear to be doing a good job as a parent as told by your descriptions in your post. Your values are a little @#%$ but at least from the sound of it your daughter will grow up to be a good contributer to society...in that you have accomplished your job as a parent. Which on the bottom line is all that matters. We can only hope that she doesn't grow up to be as selfish as daddy. Which, psychology tells us, she won't. She will learn that the needs of the alpha male are more important, since that is the philosophy she lives with.<br>

<br>
Why is a child's life worth more than an adults?  It is a cultural and biological result.  It is not based on an intellectual level.  It is also recent historically.  <br>
<br>
In the 17 and 18th centuries, the odds a woman died in childbirth was 1 in 8 over her lifetime.  10 to 30% of children died before their 5th birthday.  (Based on how healthy the population was.)  A quote from a web page on history from <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://historymedren.about.com/library/weekly/aa112200c.htm">historymedren.about.com/library/weekly/aa112200c.htm</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->:<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Peasant mothers who had their hands full with myriad daily chores were sometimes unable to keep a constant watch on their offspring, and it was not unknown for them to leave their infants or toddlers unattended. Court records illustrate that this practice was not very common and met with disapproval in the community at large, but negligence was not a crime with which distraught parents were charged when they had lost a child.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Now that being said, what the woman did in the story was horrible.  We do live in a new culture in which children's health and safety have taken a higher degree of responsibility.  She is clearly wrong and I would have a hard time not strangling her myself if I saw her.<br>
<br>
However, it does bring up issues of justice.  Why is she in jail?  Is it to protect the rest of the world from her incompetence and self centered nature?  (Just don't ler her be in charge of any kids in the future.)  Is it out of revenge?  (Justice is not suppose to ever be about revenge.)  If she had let the kids stay in the car and they lived, should she have been put in jail for life? (Is she wrong then for not rolling the windows down far enough?)<br>
<br>
The crime she committed was extreme incompetence.  Does locking her up for life fix or address anything?  I don't have the answers to this, but it is some of the stuff I have been wondering about.<br>

It is not to punish her. Assuming she is human, even the prosecution understands that she will suffer enough for the rest of her life.<br>
<br>
It is for prevention. So that the other mothers out there who don't naturally think of their children's welfare in such situations will remember to take their kids out of the car for fear of living the rest of their days in prison.<br>
<br>
The punishment portion of the criminal system is not just to punish the relevant criminal it is to deter others from repeating the same crime.<br>

If you read the article again, please note where the prosecutor promises to make an example of the woman.<br>

There's also my cynical side. (Maybe as a halfling I eat too much.) Fiesti you overreacted just the way I was sure someone would. Yes, everyone is unique, child and adult. From a practical standpoint, would dying to save my child be better or worse for a: society, b: my wife, c: the child? For c, the answer is obvious. She loses a daddy but gets to live out her potential. For b, the answer isn't so obvious. She loses a husband, who has faults but she seems to like, or she loses her only child, and she has no wishes for another. Neither one is replaceable. For a, society, the child has more potential, but more immediate notice would be my loss. (D, our relatives, the answer is clear: kid much much more important than the father.)<br>
<br>
  There's just too much emotion out there regarding the issue of children and their safety, and that's what I'm trying to attack here. Call my views selfish, even though my child wants for little, even in attention, because those are my intellectual views, not my emotional response to my little girl asking to play. I don't agree that selfishness is inherently bad. The fundamental question has not been answered: what does it mean to put a child first? How much is enough? Is there too much? What aspects of life does &quot;child first&quot; cover? Get beyond the basic physical and emotional needs.<br>
<br>
  Overprotectiveness - there comes a point where you let your kid outside without the styrofoam padding. You let them fall and get bruised and scraped. You watch over them, and eventually you let them play without any oversight at all. It's not reasonable to expect a nuclear family to have 24 / 7 oversight of even a single child, and maintain rationality. Accidents will happen to even the most protected kid, and I think it's more important to prepare the kid for not having the buffer of parents hovering.<br>
<br>
  Thanks Celdor for the non emotional reply. Like I said, I won't win this discussion, because people just get mad and holier than thou about children. I don't like treating kids like they are more important than anything, even if I wind up behaving that way, because they are just people too. People with limited cognitive and physical skills, slowly learning over time what society wants from them and what they are allowed to do, right from wrong, etc etc, and jumping on the bed a lot in between.<br>

  Also, the alpha male in the family is my wife. I even rate below the cats.<br>

While I did answer some questions or address some points from your posts, this isn't directed specifically at you.<br>
<br>
As far as the woman's punishment is concerned, it cannot be too extensive.  She left 2 helpless human beings in the car to fry.  It does not matter if she contemplated this action or not.  It is best that she be locked up and prevented from further reproduction.  Well, maybe not reproduction, but someone besides her should be raising children.  This isn't one of those &quot;we all make mistakes&quot; deals, she took negligence to a whole new level, and she should pay for that. <p>"I will take love wherever I find it and offer it to everyone who will take it, seek knowledge from those wiser, and teach those who wish to learn from me" - Duane Allman</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ughie.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ghie</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 445<br> <font color=#E9D756>(7/5/02 10:32:56 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3449.topic&index=39>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Mom Who Left Kids in Car Has Criminal Past</span><hr size=1> The line of children coming first is different for every parent.<br>
<br>
And it is the parent's right to determine that line.<br>
<br>
However, there is a limit. The law provides some guidlines to help those whose instincts are not sufficient. Most of us are smart enough that we never come close to those lines.<br>
<br>
Here are my lines. And because I am me, I do think less of people whose lines are significantly lower than mine. And I think people whose lines are more than slightly higher are overprotective nuts.<br>
<br>
Children can play outiside alone when they can respect the property lines and not run out into the street...when they can tell a stranger from a friend.<br>
<br>
Children must wear pads when skateboarding or biking or any similar activity...mostly to keep the hospital bills low...though I think that every child must make at least 3 trips to the emergency room by the time he is ten...just to build character. Most kids will find ways.<br>
<br>
Children do not ever sit in a car without a parent unless the parent is standing next to the car.<br>
<br>
Children under 80lbs in a car should be in safety seats of somesort. At the very least children will be in the back seat and buckled in.<br>
<br>
If your car doesn't have a back seat, and you have kids...get a car with a backseat. People who insist on driving a pickup truck without a back seat, just so they can have a truck, should not make the choice to have kids.<br>
<br>
Children should never be in an enclosed area with someone who is smoking.<br>
<br>
Children should never witness first hand anyone doing drugs or drinking to excess. They will see enough of this on TV.<br>
<br>
Children should not play with toy guns. Water shooters are available in forms other than Colt 45 and Glock immitation. Fantastic Laser pistols which in no way resemble a projectile firearm are acceptable for limited use. A child should be able to tell the difference between a toy gun and a real gun and know not to touch the real one.<br>
<br>
Play violence is fine in the form of sword(lightsaber) fights, water fights, dodgeball, wrestling.<br>
<br>
Children can be in crowded areas on their own if they know and understand how to find their way around and know where to look for help if needed.<br>
<br>
Children should not get every bit of attention they crave. Metering the attention and affection given to children is important on both sides. There should not be too much or too little, the just right window here is fairly large, though, and most parents don't miss it.<br>
<br>
Children who endanger themselves or others should be spanked.<br>
<br>
Children who make a scene in Wal-Mart do not get to go to Macdonalds afterwards, but they do not get smacked the whole way to the front of the store.<br>
<br>
Infants do not get Mountain Dew in their bottles.<br>
<br>
If your kids are malnourished and you are eating a bag of chips as you play Warcraft III on one PC and EQ on the other and smack their hand away from the bag of chips...there is a problem.<br>
<br>
If your child is crying you ARE aware of it and know why...Whether you do something about it depends on the why.<br>
<br>
Pizza is not a balanced meal. But if your kids are getting balanced meals most of the time, there is nothing wrong with occasional junk.<br>
<br>
Children will get the medical treatment they need and regular checkups...personal pride will not prevent an impoverished parent from being seen at the free clinic to tend to a child.<br>
<br>
Children do not need every toy that comes out with every new movie or TV show.<br>
<br>
Every child must at some point in his or her life have each of the following: A teddy bear, A slinky, Lincoln Logs, Legos, Monopoly, UNO, and a ball.<br>
<br>
Children should not spend every waking moment in front of a glowing screen.<br>
<br>
Parents should be aware at all times of the childs education...their abilities and whether they are in the right classes for their abilities in school. Parent should not push the kids into more advanced classes they aren't ready for nor should they allow their children to float though classes that are too easy for them. Don't trust they system to be more aware of your child than you.<br>
<br>
Parents should take the kids out for ice cream when they can and the kids deserve it.<br>
<br>
Parents should be able to speak from memory their childs full name and birthdate and eye color.<br>
<br>
Just my opinion, if its not yours, I reserve the right to attempt to convert you or flame you depending on my mood.<br>

I don't think she is in the same league as a killer.  She is just a self centered idiot.  Even if she walked free, I doubt any parents would suddenly say, &quot;Wow!  Cool!  We can finally kill our kids.&quot;  I never made any excuses for her nor did I play down her actions.<br>

<br>
So should she get the death penality to teach other parents not to be neglectiful? Or should she have her tubes tied and child taken away and never be allowed to baby sit? Would that deter mothers from repeating her mistake?<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Because at the time of their birth, they have more of a future than you. You cannot compare the contribution to society of a 6 year old vs. a 26 year old. You are thinking 2-dimensionally. Who says when they reach your age, they won't be doing more positive things than you've ever dreamed of doing? You could have the next Mother Teresa, for all you know. You bet on their life as a whole, not on their life as it is right now. It is your duty to teach, protect and provide for your children because YOU are the one that brought them into the world. It is a decision you conciously made (they may have been an &quot;accident&quot;, but you decided to keep them), please don't do it half-assed.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

They could be the next Hitler as well. All they have is potential for good or bad. What value is potential over a realized value?<br>
<br>
I think it is interesting to think which has more value: 2 year old vs 3 year old? 2 vs 10? 2 vs 18? 2 vs 26? At some age growing up, does a person become less important and less valuable? If so what is the age?<br>
<br>
I think the main reason we value children is because they are helpless and innocent and we hope for a positive future for them. But it is all emotional and not intellectual. I am not advocating anything here. I am just stirring the intellectual pot and see what people think.<br>
