<br>
It is time for me to start my life over again.  And yes - I am NOT a casual player - so for those of you that don't understand what I mean - or think that EQ is &quot;JUST A GAME&quot; I am sorry that it is beyond you.<br>
<br>
My wife left me 3 years ago to &quot;find herself&quot;.  So - I waited patiently ... and hopefully ... but during that time ... in my lonliness ... I chose to find some fun after work.<br>
<br>
Enter Norrath ...<br>
<br>
Now ... after 1 full year from the finalized divorce papers ... and much grieving ... it is time for me to pick up the pieces and start again.  I could not do this at my level of play time nor my commitment on many levels.<br>
<br>
So - I board the ship and head west ...<br>
<br>
Without further ado ... I shall say my final statement and thank you-s to the community.<br>
<br>
Lanys T'vyl ... I love you guys and girls.  By far the best server ( though I only played on 2 ... Veeshan prior to this one ).  Certainly one of the most giving and caring.<br>
<br>
First and foremost ... to my Guild ... Dark Whispers.  Thank you for believing in me.  Thank you for standing with me.  Thank you for standing on solid values that make us a great guild.  Day after day I recieved tells from other guild leaders and officers that mentioned how disciplined, focused, and compassionate you are.  I am DAMN proud of you all.<br>
<br>
To my officers ... thanks ... words can't express my love for you guys.<br>
<br>
Venr ... damn you for leaving early.  I kicked you out of my guild and yet we remained friends.  Heh - I will never forget out first OPEN PoF raid - back in the day when it was still far too dangerous to do west wall breaks less you were IF, SA, or CoT.  And we did it bro.  The famous Istrahd training the mobs away and dying - LOL.  We took CT that day - and we were so powa.  Thank you for the gear ... and for killing my butt in ToFS .. and thank God we could summon and rez ourselves - lol.<br>
<br>
Stillnight - thank you for dying for me on one of our last Vox raids - back when people just couldn't kill Vox ... lol ... you lost 2 levels for me that night - and didn't get the xp back.<br>
<br>
Llorian - thanks for always being kind and willing to talk.  Your wisdom and gentleness is unsurpassed.<br>
<br>
Tarot - thanks for your wisdom.  I was always too much a softy to really be mean or wise ... /sigh ... but i got it more towards the end.  Dang you - I wish I coulda had one kiss on Fear portal hill ... but heck - being nekkid with you there FD was fun enough.<br>
<br>
Leolan - You are the server stud ... I don't care what Taliesn says.  Thanks for your insight and philosophical outlook.  Thanks for dealing with all the crap people give you on this board.  You do a dang good job - and I am proud of you.  I am glad you made your move and that you are getting some good opportunities to do things.<br>
<br>
Venen - my first necro friend.  Heh - and all our shitlist fights.  There was a season we didn't see eye-to-eye ... but in the end - I will never forget making up in PoH ... and being able to be civil to each other at the end of my time here.  Thank you for being an inspiration to me as a young necro ... you always pushed through.<br>
<br>
Dondor - you crazy human pally.  Thank you for the SMR for the chanter epic.  BTW - MM is going back to Nizzdal for now.  So he remains an officer in DW.  Sorry we never had more time to hang - even though you always pestered me for it.  I love you man.<br>
<br>
Sasha - you were never a stranger ... you always said hiyas ... and I love you dearly for that ... even though you married Don.<br>
<br>
Donord - yes - the dwarf - not the human ... thanks for being you bro.<br>
<br>
Cidric - I will miss you my dear sweet friend.  You are head above all ... and I am so glad that I got to meet you.<br>
<br>
Noggel - I hate that they changed your name.  Dang Verant to HELL.  You are so powa ... thanks for all the info and all the great times.<br>
<br>
Kelderre - you are true blue.  Love you.<br>
<br>
Adjani - heh ... you are saucy.  Thank you for all you offered to the game.  BTW - marry Taliesn - PWEASE.<br>
<br>
Taliesn - Sorry that I didn't give you a full opportunity to pour back into me.  You did call it from the begining ... and thought I held back - you were right.  Marry Adjani and all your fantasies might come true - <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->     <br>
<br>
Felishanna - Dang you for not marrying Istrahd.  He really had a good heart.  /sniff sniff<br>
<br>
Pimm - you were one of the most giving people I know bro.  Thank you for all you gave to this server.  Thanks for your friendship.<br>

<br>
Gratiano - thanks for reminding everyone that the game was meant to be fun.  Thanks for coming to Whispers.  I always looked up to you.<br>
<br>
Asla - you are a sweetie.  never proud - always humble ... and always kind.<br>
<br>
Jarsek - you are a god too.  No one can farm like Jarsek - and no necro is crazier (well ... Venr came pretty dang close).  Thank you for pulling the temple with me - that was a fun night bro ... and tanks for the times in SF for XP.<br>
<br>
Tovin - you are the original legend.  All necros strove to be like you and wanted to solo fear - lol.<br>
<br>
Sepnir - you are crazy ... and I admired that in you.<br>
<br>
Neesha - you are the sweetest of necros.  You and your ice cream.  Hang in there - there are very few left - and you have what it takes.  I will send you how I do the amy temple <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->     <br>

I love you all - and will miss you greatly.  Take care of Norrath in my absense ... and maybe somewhere - somehow - we will meet again.<br>
<br>
EDIT NOTE:  I ran Istrahd into PoF one last time to the North wall ... after transfering tradable gear.  I sat down ... said some good byes - logged - and deleted Istrahd and canceled the account.  Those of you that know me ... know that I am serious about things ... and I wont be back ... as much as the loss of you all, my friends, pains my heart.  I shall dream of you forever and remember our fond memories.  /hug<br>

Damn, I dunno what to say..  you will surely be missed.. that's for one.  Certainly one of the more personable people on Lanys, the server loses a great person with your leave.  <br>
<br>
Best of luck in the future, and in restarting your life.  Take care, Ist, and I hope you find what you're looking for.<br>

One of my biggest regrets in EQ, is this; I got a tell from Istrahd...a few necros were soloing Fear. I didn't go. I thought they were insane. Eventually they did die.<br>
<br>
I'd give alot to be able to go back and say, &quot;I'm otw! WOOT!&quot; <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
