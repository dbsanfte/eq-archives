<br>
No, I am asking you to explain why you believe one thing is a freedom and the other is not.<br>
<br>
In your first two posts you talked about two general things.<br>
<br>
1) Freedom of privacy, such as the FBI/CIA/etc not needing a warrent etc<br>
<br>
then you went on the tangent of<br>
2) Freedom of, well, smoking and drinking<br>
<br>
#2 (from this quote)<br>
&quot; Laws that say a 16-year-old may not smoke or drink, IMO, are unconstitutional. .esp when beer and cigarettes are legal. When the government mandates and regulates our freedom, we no longer are free.&quot;<br>
<br>
I have been responding to the tangent (#2) you went on because I don't see where you reasoning for this is.  I have never argued with you about the first one, that was never my intention.  Yet, you keep bringing it up and responding with it.  I have no interest in aruging it, because I don't really disagree with that part.<br>
<br>
Just go with me here, forgot all the crap we said earlier; this is the only reason I am arguing with you.<br>
<br>
I say smoking and drinking are no more a freedom than driving is (just like many things, but these are the examples we have been using).  Which means, I don't believe any of those are some freedom we are born with.  There are cultural standards that we base things acceptable on.  We are not just born with a freedom of &quot;I can do whatever I want and if you try to stop me you are infringing on my freedom&quot;.<br>
<br>
You don't seem to think driving is a freedom, yet what is the distinction between driving and drinking in your mind? Why is drinking a freedom and driving not?<br>
<br>
There are reasons some things are illegal to a certain age, or illegal period.  I don't see the connection between limiting these and freedom, because these aren't freedoms to begin with.  If they ARE freedoms to begin with, you need to explain why drinking is a freedom but driving is not a freedom.<br>
<br>
Without any clear distingtion on what is a freedom and what is not, I don't see why you have any right to criticize a law and claiming it infringes on your freedom.<br>
<br>
Ok? So lets drop the crap and just talk about the above. <p>Tuan {Cupcakes} the Vicar</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/utuan00dorf.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tuan00Dorf</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 1343<br> <font color=#E9D756>(6/4/02 8:36:23 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=305.topic&index=22>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Freedom for security?</span><hr size=1> &quot;Do you think driving is a right?&quot;<br>
<br>
Incase that wasn't apparent in the last post, yes driving is a right.  Most things we do are rights established by our culutre, not because of a born freedom to do whatever we want.  I think that attitude is what causes many problems in our society, some people believe they are free to do anything they want.  Which is why I don't see laws as restricting us from our freedoms. <p>Tuan {Cupcakes} the Vicar</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/urheaton.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Rheaton</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 213<br> <font color=#E9D756>(6/4/02 11:13:43 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=305.topic&index=23>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Freedom for security?</span><hr size=1> Alrighty.. First I want to say that many times I will speak in generalizations. Its not a good habit to get into, but when one doesn't have a lot of time to 'break it down', generalizations tend to surface.<br>
<br>
There is clearly a distinction between what some would call 'inherent human rights' and those rights which are governed by something like a constitution. When comparing a 16 year old driving with a 16 year old smoking, I was trying to point out what I feel there is a contradiction in freedoms.<br>
<br>
Allow me to explain my thinking... and I know good and well that many out there may take exception..<br>
<br>
&quot;The right to freedom and the pursuit of happiness&quot; What does that mean? To me it means that I have the right to pursue happiness. Those things that are legal and that give me happiness are the things I can pursue. I may be born with an 'inherent right' to pursue something illegal that makes me happy, but I do not have a constitutional right to pursue illegal happiness. Suicide is murder....murder is illegal. Along the lines of medically assisted suicide, many think that the inherent right to happiness prevails. That is if dying makes you happy, you should have a right to do so. Yet constitutionally you do not have a right to murder. I know that medically assisted suicide is an extreme example, but I needed to point it out to make a point.<br>
<br>
To me smoking is suicide. You are slowly killing yourself and taking risks with your health. Perhaps &quot;Russian Roulette&quot; is a better example, but the same applies... you are legally doing something that has great implications and risks in regards to your health. A smoker is very possibly speeding up the clock of life to a faster death.   Most smokers say it brings them pleasure...or happiness.<br>
<br>
Eating also brings many happiness and pleasure. Most of the time it is the extremely unhealthy foods that bring us the most eating pleasure. The continued digestion of these unhealthy foods may very well cause devastating problems with your health. The separation between food and cigarettes is clear: We must have food to survive. We do not need cigarettes to survive, and aside from that, nicotine is a controlled substance. We can draw a line between the two in regards to ill health effect, cause and necessity. But in the pursuit of happiness, and our use of either, the results are very equal. We choose to intake this garbage in our daily pursuit of happiness.<br>
<br>
How old does one have to be in order to understand the definition of &quot;addicting&quot;? The laws on the books reflect that the consensus believe a 16 year old does not fully understand the definition of &quot;addicting&quot;.... Therefore, we have laws to protect them...for another two years while they learn. We snatch from them the freedom to pursue legal happiness based on a age technicality while sliding a greasy, heart-clogging cheeseburger into their hand.<br>
<br>
My example of a 16 year old driving was to show that if a 16 year old can understand the sever risks of driving, they can understand the sever risk in smoking.<br>
<br>
Now then...the meat.: I am over the age of 18 and I have the legal freedom to smoke if I so choose...because smoking is legal. A 16 year old, fully able, IMO, to understand the harms and hazards of smoking, does not share the same freedom as I. Now, I know there are several laws on the books that grant freedoms and rights upon turning a certain age.... like the right to vote, etc. But there are no constitutional rights in regards to smoking...at any age..unless you consider the right to pursue happiness. What is at issue here (smoking) is protection and safety. As perhaps a parent yourself, would you rather you had the say-so in regards to your kid's safety, or are you ok with the government restricting, limiting or removing freedoms in the name of safety and or health?<br>

<br>
Alcohol is dangerous to self, but not others unless you then do something dumb like drive a car.<br>
<br>
Smoking doesn't just kill yourself. Through passive smoking, it can hurt others as well. If <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> everyone</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> nearby is smoking, I guess that's pretty irrelevant.<br>
<br>
Driving a car is <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> very</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> dangerous to other people.<br>
<br>
There's many drugs that are much less dangerous to self and others than nicotine, (and much more fun<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ), but aren't legal.<br>
<br>
There's age limits on sexual activities in most places. (as well their should be)<br>
<br>
Some juristictions ban some sexual activities that don't hurt anyone.<br>
<br>
Age limits are usually to ensure that people have the required level of maturity/responsibility to understand the danger to themselves and others, and to know how to minimise such risks. Hate to sound like an old fart, but younger people are more likely take bigger risks without really thinking about the consequences. Also, a 16year old who understands the dangers of driving a car (if I fsck up I could die <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> now</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> or be quadraplegic for life), doesn't neccesarily think the same way about smoking (there's a chance I might die earlier, some time in the way distant future).<br>
<br>
At least in Australia, suicide is not illegal. You're going to sound pretty stupid telling a corpse they have the right to remain silent.<br>
<br>
Seatbelts are an interesting issue too. It's not likely to hurt anyone else if you don't wear one (maybe passengers in a car if the driver doesn't, or other motorists?). But is there any reason, other than laziness, why you wouldn't want to? Is there some sort of thrill from driving without one? I wouldn't know. I grew up always wearing a seatbelt, and it comes as a reflex action to me. I'll discover that I've put on the seatbelt when I'm hopping in a car to move it a couple of  meters across a paddock. I'm also fortunate that my parents chose to put me in one of those kiddy seats with proper restraints at a time when it wasn't a legal requirement to do so for kids under a certain age. And that my mother wore a seatbelt when she was not required to because she was more than <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> x</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> months pregnant. She, my unborn sister, and I would probably not have survived the car crash otherwise, but we all escaped undamaged (Dad broke his nose on the steering wheel). I ended up with my photo in the paper and such (aw, look at the cute baby, saved by the child safety seat... make them a legal requirement - they became one shortly afterwards).<br>
<br>
Generally I'm not sure I'm too keen on laws that are there just to protect people from themselves, but I think this is a good law. Without it, people would get used to not wearing seatbelts, and endanger themselves. Maybe it sounds like &quot;once we take away your liberties, you'll never know what you're missing&quot;. But I really don't think you're losing anything by wearing a seatbelt. <p>----------------------------------<br>

When you go to the DMV and get that drivers licence you are essencially (sp?) entering a contractual agreement with that state that you understand the rules of the road and agree to abide by them when operating a motor vehicle on state operated and maintained roads. Breaking this contract ( and getting caught <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ) has penalties in the form of monetary fines and points taken away. Break the contract in a harsh enough manner or repeatedly and you lose the privilidge of driving on State roads. Sure, you can still legally drive up and down your driveway (private property). Don't know about other states but, in Georgia, moving violation citations cannot be written on private property but, documentation violations can. The one exception to moving violation citations on private property is Driving under the influence. <br>
<br>
The govenment restricts the age or use of certain things for reasons of safety and public tranquility. As stated above some of these are a generally accepted  ages for levels of matruity and understanding. Maturity/understand levels vary with the person but, there must be a certain middleground.  Lord knows when I was 16 I thought I was Bo Duke in the General Lee on those back country roads. Even a &quot;free&quot; society must have laws on the books to maintain a &quot;free&quot; society. While it seems to be a contradiction, freedoms we have and deem important are protected by laws that restrict freedoms we deem less important. It is a trade off really and all depends on what our society deems important and less important.<br>
