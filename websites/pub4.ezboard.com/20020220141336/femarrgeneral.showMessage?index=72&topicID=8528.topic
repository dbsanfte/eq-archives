<br>
A lot of the posters on this board have been playing since before I started (Aug 99 I think, such a hazy past) and yet continue to play even though they hate Verant with a passion, shit on each an all of their ideas, and are so sick to death of the game that it makes them pull their hair out!<br>
<br>
STOP PLAYING THEN!! CANCEL YOUR ACCOUNT!!<br>
<br>
Why pay 10 dollars per month when you're obviously so dissatisfied with the game? If the content you were expecting isnt in-game by now (and like Tuan, I can't find any mention of all these *great new ideas* on the back of the original fold open box) then why do you continue to play? Are you mindless? It's a game, no-one forces you to play it. Hit the power button on your PC. You're in charge you know!<br>
<br>
I think I have had my money's worth of enjoyment from the game, and still do. I've purchased two copies of each and every expansion, payed 10 dollar's (well, about 7 pounds actually) per month for two account over the last two+ years and feel that it's still a bargain price. Will I go onto the Legend's server? Doubt it, not that I think it's a bad idea, I'm just happy where I am and with what I currently get for my money.<br>
<br>
10 Years ago people were forking out cash for VCR's. Not long ago Sony and co. started making DVD players. You can still buy a VCR if you want, and buy/rent video cassettes, but if you want to you can pay more for a DVD player and DVD's with better quality and more features. It's the way of the world, people who can afford more, and want to pay more, can get better items / cars / houses / hotel accomodation / whatever.<br>
<br>
Pay a dollar for a hotdog, or two dollars for a Jumbo one. If you can't the afford the Jumbo hotdog, it's not the vendor's fault. Should they stop selling Jumbo Hotdogs? Should they never have introduced Jumbo Hotdogs in the first place? Are they wrong to want to make more money? Hell no, why on earth start a business if you don't want to make money?<br>
And if you're not satisfied with what you originally paid for, dont go there again!!<br>
<br>
And as for all those people who whine about Verant not caring, so what? Don't play anymore. Cancel your account and stop filling Verant's *phat* pockets.<br>

<br>
Compare the situation to a common advertising &quot;mistruth&quot; of the times.  You see a commercial for a cellular phone advertising a tri-mode phone with internet capabilities.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Wow honey, I could really use a cell phone in case of emergencies and such,&quot; says a_significant_other_01, &quot;and it has email capability!!&quot;<br>
<br>
a_significant_other_01 travels to the phone store and purchases said phone, yes it has the capabilities, but is a_significant_other_01 willing to pay the extra $30 a month plus talk time fees to use said benefit for checking the latest football scores or stock quotes via the web?  Not likely, unless they have the extra cash to essentially burn.<br>
<br>
So it really boils down to economics, this Legends server is an experiment therein.  I really think its success/failure will have absolutely no bearing on the price of future titles.  The cost of those will rise on their own, independent of this due to inflation.  If anyone here believes that SWG is going to cost $10 a month, I have some bad news for you - there's no way in hell.  VI has already stated that they shot themselves in the foot with that pricing - that it wasn't farsighted enough on their end.<br>
<br>
So here's to the people willing to pony up $40 a month - cheers!  And all the rest of us can smile, wish them well, and hope that the experiment inspires the regular server GM's to be more involved.<br>
<br>
Oh and please, for the love of Pete, stop attempting to use your account cancellation as a threat to the rest of us, its awfully silly and more than likely just a vent anyway.  As a bard I have, since April 99, been witness to all manner of VI screwups with my class, GM events, nerf issues, etc., ad nauseum.  Every time something like this occurs, people threaten the rest of us with, &quot;that's f@#king it, if they do this again, I'm gonna cancel my account!!!&quot; or &quot;this is the straw that's going to break VI!!&quot;  You are not and it is not so please....shhhh!!  Take a deep breath and realize what you are saying.<br>
<br>
Anyway,<br>
No flame, just my thoughts.<br>

i also think they are adding shnarfs cool features when they release this one <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
But serioulsy Im sure Verant is truely doing this to improve the game and keep its players interested due to the upcoming release of new games.  The sad thing is they already have a much better high end game then most of the others atm. and this legends deal seems to be causing a lot of greif with a lot of thier high end players.  I dont have the answer and i wish i did.  Eq is a great game and still know a lot of great players who play it.<br>
<br>
good luck to you all<br>

<br>
btw asgro our archers are getting nerfed as we speak.  they are just too damn powerfull.  I might be mistaken but i belive there is an archer in your realm selling his acount going for 800 dollars near opening at ebay, due to some of the nerfs they have implamented and are planning to due<br>
<br>
but still it is a rouge class and they are a blast in RVR <br>

Its sad but true, we all know it.  <br>
<br>
Lots of interesting points brought up here.<br>
<br>
Elwyn mentioned a lack of kids being a possible bonus but surely there are enough rich kids (or parents who will happily spend $40 to keep their kids quiet) to populate this server with the usual amount of immature brats.  I mean whats a pair of Nikes cost these days..$100 ??  and lots of kids have that kind of thing bought all the time.  I actually wish El is right on this one but I just doubt it.<br>
<br>
<br>
Timezones for the 50% of the EQ population (guesstimate, shoot me).  Its going to be a USA timezone server so no Euro player is going to go there because all the dynamic content will happen when they are asleep.<br>
<br>
The majority of people (from reading the boards) are furious that so many cool features that were advertised with the initial game (they were Tuan) are not only coming out nearly 3 years late but costing us to boot!<br>
<br>
Its all one huge rip-off and I think it stinks, they should at the very least give us the map feature for free, I know my GM is really looking forward to being able to track down those anon guildies who hide doing AA xp when something like RoF is on (although god knows its boring).<br>
<br>
I think its a really bad pr move for verant and will piss off the majority of their subsrcibers (who will keep playing of course).<br>
<br>
<br>

My box reads &quot;ever changing content&quot; and to some extent I've had this. Items have been added and nerfed and changed but not to any major extent.<br>
<br>
Maybe people made a mistake and assumed that &quot;ever changing world&quot; meant that quests and battles would have an effect on the way the world worked and it didn't. Verant's definition of a 'dynamic quest' ( from their web site ) and this was promised in the manual was 'a quest used to reward groups of players who have done well or helped others, controlled by a gm that would provide rewards that cannot be gained through the course of the normal game.' <br>
<br>
This wording has long since been removed from the site so it's not a direct quote. To an extent this has been added but I dont consider what we've had to fit totally in with the description.<br>
<br>
So maybe people did make an assumption but I made that assumption too. Oops.<br>
<br>
It's not worth bitching about to be honest. Verant will release the server and it will fill up with the same people that are around now. I'll tell you this though. I won't be paying for it nor would I pay for a new game at this price. You want more money do the game right, dont piss off your fan base and have people leave, advertise well, get better reviews, provide a better service and you can have more money in the form of a higher number of players.<br>
<br>
If you think there will be a higher or lower number of d00dz then you're wrong. The percentages wont change, assholes will still play.<br>
<br>
As for the hotdog analogy. If we read it the way it was intended then we have a grievance. This is like turning up at the hotdog stand and being given the small hotdog when you asked for the jumbo. When you mention you were offered the jumbo for the price you're paying they say &quot;er...um...no it costs too much money to provide a jumbo hotdog for this price so we're now offering a new price stucture whereby you pay more for what you should have got anyway.&quot; <p><CENTER><A HREF="http://ak.lonelygamer.com">

Any game that needs the extra staff they are going to need to try to provide this much dynamic content on a daily basis as they claim, without it being automatically generated, is going to cost more than $10 at this point in time for them.<br>
<br>
That's really the problem. If I were VI, I would have focused on improving their game and <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> making</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> it dynaimc, instead of <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> forcing it</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> to be dynamic by hiring people to add content constantly. This is a tough feat, don't get me wrong, all new games are struggeling with this concept because it is something that will need to be done to sell games in the future and/or to keep a player base.<br>
<br>
I argue that they are introducing new content at the cost that they need to be, so they aren't depriving the players there; but I also think it was the wrong way to do it.  <p>Tuan {Cupcakes} the Vicar</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/umitchtheblonde.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mitch The Blonde</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 2697<br> <font color=#E9D756>(2/4/02 6:05:55 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrgeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8528.topic&index=84>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Same general thing available</span><hr size=1> The mission generators in AO were a big step in creating ongoing non CS-assisted dynamic events.

They got around 8 people together headed by Lady Daegarmo and we we're all promised more events and things to brighten up EverQuest.<br>
<br>
What we got was the Best of the Best. <br>
<br>
Now I know you not only took part in that but did well, and I'm sure you enjoyed it. But do you think the rest of us preffered that to what Daegarmo was touted to be creating?  <br>
<br>
It takes a few minutes to come up with some rare artefact items. It takes a discussion between 4 or 5 players before we find every way to exploit it. It then takes about an hour to invent a decent quest that can be run within an hour. And then you just run that on every server. Probably wouldn't take more then an hour to run. Then you hit another bunch of players.<br>
<br>
How hard would it be to decide the orcs are invading Greater Staydark and up the mob count, to a point where the orcs seem to be killing the guards through superior numbers.<br>
<br>
Lets step it up a bit. Dyanmic team decides a fire breathing dragon is going to invade West Commons. They patch the zone with a few new trees that are on fire, direct fromm burning woods and change some grass to a burnt colour. ( Single zone patch ) and they insert the dragon. They they just let some guides roleplay a bit, it doesnt have to be brilliant, it just has to be new.<br>
<br>
What about secretly patching a few zones over the course of a few days and then having that dragon terrorize another place once its reduced to 25% health. That guild then has to do the investigation to find where it went before they get the loot etc.<br>
<br>
That was what I was hoping for when the dyamic quest team was invented.<br>
<br>
I don't think it takes masses of people to do this. I really disagree that 10 people being paid GM prices couldn't do this.<br>

What is the point of charging an additional US$30p.c.m for a teeny bit of extra window dressing? It doesn't scale with the costs of just producing and maintaining EQ by a long way.<br>
<br>
EQ Legends server's 'extra service' and dynamic content stuff should just cost additional US$5-00p.c.m. tops. That is including fee 'consideration' for the notional concept. <br>
<br>
Looking at total proportions of coding and comparative development times and marketing and digital design the greater input effort is spent right there in standard EQ.
