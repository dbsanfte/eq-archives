I know as a druid I hate the camp. I have sent in several suggestions on ways to modify the quest that would keep roughly the same time sink, probably make the quest more difficult than waiting around, but be achievable in smaller chunks of time. Whether it's 1, 2, 3, 4, or even 8 hours, I'd like the cleric to wait, but not to the extent that they do now in one sitting.<br>
<br>
  Among my suggestions were collecting multiple no drop items, either from easy kill mobs (like, level 1), or ground spawns. Put a 2 or 3 hour timer on the very random location spawn (skyfire is a good place for it), and you have a possible answer. Ground spawn is if they didn't like the advantage a tracker has, otherwise have the ranger or ranger twink see if it's up. My suggestion would probably lengthen the average wait, but split it up into chunks that people can handle without having to take time off from work.<br>
<br>
  The end result of however many parts are needed would be turned in to spawn RF. Only someone who turned in the part would get the other part needed for the final combine. (Possibly that part would be NoRent if they are worried about group B KSing group A because group B failed last time.) Etc.<br>
<br>
  It can almost be a fun outing, but it's much more likely to be a frustrating, hatefilled time. Maybe that's what Verant was going for. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/usefaakajira.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sefa Akajira</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 94<br> <font color=#E9D756>(6/27/02 2:53:23 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrgeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=9993.topic&index=10>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Perhaps not condescending, but...</span><hr size=1> Kahelwizzie said re a posting saying cleric didn't have the 8 days of 24/7 camping:<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  Not trying to be elitist of anything of the sort here, but asking an honest question: Why should you get the epic then?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
The answer is <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> partially</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> that even putting in the necessary time is meaningless unless you can also find 12, 18, 24  &lt;depending on group makeup/levels&gt; who are willing to spend it with you.  <br>
<br>
Now that a few guilds have forced RF to be an FFA mob, camping it is totally useless unless you are in a guild that is large enough to instantly mobilize in sufficient force.  You don't have even 10 minutes to get your guildmates on-line.  <br>
<br>
A cleric in our guild *did* put in that time and effort ... she not only was not allowed time to call any of us -- the guild that took the mob out from under her mocked her with very cruel statements.<br>
<br>
Please do not assume when someone says they don't have that kind of time that it means they don't *deserve* their epic!!  They have done as much work as any cleric in the large guilds that have the kind of force on-line at all times to mobilize instantly.  My question is why shouldn't clerics in small or mid-sized guilds be allowed to get their epic? <p><img src="http://home.attbi.com/~sefakajira/sefasig.jpg" width=89 height=159><BR><BR>Sefa

<br>
Because no one has a right to some odd piece of loot.  Again, I hate to bring up the warrior epic as an analogy, but Sevvy has always been FFA.  Always.  If someone tried camping him claiming they needed a green scale for their epic they'd just be laughed at.  There wouldn't even be a debate on the boards.<br>
<br>
Whoever gets there &quot;the firstest with the mostest&quot; is going to get the kill and their epic, not the person spamming in /ooc that it's camped.<br>

<br>
Few weeks ago, we tried bringing the whole guild to sit and wait for Ragefire. The whole guild was going to hang out for as long as we could till he spawned. That way, if he spawns, we don't have to wait at ALL for anyone to show up- bang, he's ours.<br>
<br>
Another guild decided that that was a &quot;good idea&quot; and brought their guildies over. (After we had already assembled most of the people that were going to be there.) Admittedly, we were &quot;camping&quot; ragefire and excluding anyone else from being able to get that spawn. <br>
<br>
In any case, the other guild gathered a force, moved to Skyfire and PnP'd the camp from us.<br>
<br>
The competition isn't just who can get there after* the guy spawns, the competition is actually starting to take place before* he spawns.<br>
<br>
Khael, personally, I don't see anything epic about sitting staring at one place for 4 or 5 RL days waiting for a creature to spawn.<br>
<br>
When Verant moved the spawn location to Skyfire, they actually increased the timer and fewer cleric epics are being completed than before.<br>
<br>
In any case, there's quite a few weapons that are better than the Warrior epic... Most of the warriors that have gotten their epics have placed it in the bank a short while after. To the best of my knowledge, there isn't anything that can take the place of a cleric epic.<br>
<br>
Honestly, I don't care- I'm not going to get my epic unless they make Ragefire a triggered spawn. Since Verant doesn't want the cleric epic to enter the world any faster and I'm sure would limit the rate more if they could without hearing the screams, I don't expect Ragefire to be a triggered spawn.<br>
<br>
In short, there isn't anything epic about sitting in Skyfire for 5 days waiting for Ragefire to spawn only to have another guild sail in and kill him while your forces are gathering. I'd consider the 10th ring war to be epic. Skyfire is just assinine.<br>
