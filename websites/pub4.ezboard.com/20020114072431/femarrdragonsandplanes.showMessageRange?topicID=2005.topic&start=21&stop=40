<br>
Yes, Lendari might have some friends out there, but the only reason they are still friends is because she has yet to find something to use them for at which point she will be found out causing her to blow it completely out of proportion and try to put a guilt trip on them. The guild trip usually won't work, so she'll storm off like the child that she is and not talk to them for several months or maybe several days depending on how deluded she is that day. OR she might even delete her character claiming she's quiting the game because of said person, but that's only in extreme versions. Give it a few months and she'll get her character back and/or create another one and play anonymously until everything has kind of blown over. Rinse, lather, repeat.<br>
<br>
I believe that she can be a nice person. I don't doubt there are nice qualities in her personality, but she has a wicked temper tantrum that will hopefully be cured when she gets her drivers license.<br>
<br>
Lendari, do not think I'm doing this to spite you. Well maybe I am a little. I've held a bit of a grudge, though I wouldn't call it that because it's not something that is heavy on my mind. Just happened to come up when I read this thread.<br>
<br>
To whoever she is dating in the game now, or married to, or whatever, you have my blessing. No I didn't date her. Even if I were a guy or a lesbian, I wouldn't touch the drama with a 20 foot pole. I just witnessed a lot of soap opera useless crap that she created.<br>
<br>
Okay I feel better. Bye now. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uannocstarshield.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Annoc Starshield</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 28<br> <font color=#E9D756>(6/12/01 2:22:12 pm)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Lendari</span><hr size=1>   Well I see alot of people are jumping on the Anti-Lendari bandwagon becuase they can.   Now is she perfect? No, and she has done some pretty dumb things.  Now this does not make her a bad person or a loot whore nor does she get off because she is a Blond.  She is just very moody and sometimes needs reminding on what is right and wrong.  She tries to do the right thing and does appologize when she knows she is in the wrong.  It just bothers me when I see people slamming her just because others do and they want to jump in.  Now not everyone here has done that but there are a few.<br>

Most of the people that posted here have ridden on the 'Lendari Experience'.  Most people gave it a D-.  Chamcham even backed up my Fear raid story, she is a selfish (and apparently childish) little brat who uses large groups of people for her own benefit and bails when things go south.  She hasn't done this once or twice, but countless times.  You are blinded by love or something if you can't see that.<br>

I was not talking about those who had bad expericiences with her in Fear just those who flame and blast her because she is an easy target.  She is not a bad girl she just needs to grow up a little.

Now if you dont know she is wearing that tunic right now she did roll on it cause she was going to use it No she didnt trade it to me in fact one of her tells said I cant trade it ill feel bad about it. But just so you know lendari is using the tunic right now and if im not mistaken she gave the group her old shroud. I dont know anything about her fear raids but she is not a loot whore if you want to blame someone blame me for asking to trade for it<br>

I think Lendari plays a lot better than a jack ass and is a wonderful druid. I didn't think it was right for them to take her Shroud of Nature away just to make sure she would wear it all the time. Lendari has been the best friend to me yet cus we both are the same age. Maybe you think she acts like that cus you don't remember how 14 year olds act sometimes. You probably would have acted the same when you were her age.<br>

What the fuck is your problem? I told you if you gave me my shroud back, I'd give you this damn tunic, I said I didn't want any of this to happen, so I was getting rid of the problem. I told my friend Dews no, after he had sat in EC and wasted 5 people's days buying PKT and stuff for this trade.<br>
<br>
to Chamcham: What is up with you? You act all buddy buddy with me, and then when you read this you totally hate me. You were aware of the situation as it was happening. Cham well according to you you'd never hold anything agasint me, that is your exact words from last night. I would never purpously gate out of a fear raid, it's not my fault I'm ditzy. My mother really was nagging me to get off of eq because i was failing 3 classes. Don't pull that we were abandoned crap, my brother logged on Lendari and offered to port all of you out, and Felonius refused the offer. Don't go saying I didn't do anything to help.<br>
<br>
Gilgamel: I know im annoying, and I never once asked you for 15k. the reason i refused to evac you to EJ is because i was new to sebilis and had no clue where you were. and tell Emily i said hi.<br>
<br>
Azhar: Didn't i tell you to leave me alone?<br>
<br>
Annoc: =)<br>
<br>
I think that's everyone. whatever. im done, im giving the tunic to Matril and maybe I'll find one of my friends to loan me 3500 to buy another shroud. as for Shadon, I know so many people who just wish you'd die, so many who think you're a whiny tool. I disbanded that group the other night because you were annoying the shit out of me with your bitching, and Fizzealot said that I wasnt needed for king. Excuse me but, i said get someone who could better hold the job if i couldnt. I logged off and I log on the next day and everyone is flaming me. put yourself in my place for a day.. I know I am not exactly the smartest person alive but I have enough common sence to give the tunic to you Shadon.. but not anymore, not after you pull this crap and expect me to be like aww, ok, i love you, here's the tunic... whatever.. I wish i woudl have never joined the fucking king group... you want loot whores? Some paladin in Lummox, i dont know who, this is according to Cammile, had Royal Velium Greaves, and won the Valorium over Cammile, who has jarsath. what is up with that?? you're calling ME a loot whore, after I offered to give this tunic to you. Someone is a little mentally unstable lol. I mean you think its all one big joke flaming somebody here. But for my friends, and people who stick up for me(who thanks to you, there arent many left).. they go through hell just as bad as I do. Inviticus has posted some crap about me too saying I cyber for loot, which is total bullshit, and saying that I ninja loot on fear raids? ok. To inviticus: 1. I've never done fear with you.. 2. I dont like you, stop talking to me? 3. Grow up 4. if i had the verm tunic, i'd be wearing it, not a fungi. Anyways, I'm losin leveling time here, so I'm going back on Emarr. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uraelven.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Raelven</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.acsu.buffalo.edu/~gcarella/10pixel.jpg BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 486<br> <font color=#E9D756>(6/12/01 5:28:39 pm)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Lendari</span><hr size=1> That is how 14 year olds talk now?<br>

I do have to say though that blaming her actions for her age is crap. It depends on the person. I know people who are 25 playing this game that act more immature than some 12 year olds playing it. I myself am only 16 years old, and I must say that I've noticed many people who act ALOT more immature than myself. For example, the 32 year old that started talking about Tunare's breasts during the GM event and asking if he could be her child's daddy, while a friend of mine 15 years old did the responsible thing and helped people quit those kind of distracting comments.. Basically, what I'm saying is, age is just a number. A person's age should be almost irrelevant to their actions, with some consideration for the &gt;18 year olds, who have to suddenly leave at times for parental reasons. If you agree with me, great.

Annoc - I'm not jumping on any band wagon. If you'll look at my post count you'll see I spend very little time here, thus I could really care less what is said. I just needed a little therapy release for the emotion I wasted on someone who turned out to be selfish and manipulative. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ulendariquisalas.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lendari Quisalas</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#E9D756>(6/12/01 6:43:05 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Lendari</span><hr size=1> See Nire is cool that way. And so is Annoc. I'm actually afk right now on my comp because Len is sitting in necrosis. Well, I'm still undecided weather I'm going to quit EQ or not. Some people tell me that I should, and some tell me I shouldn't. Hothgar hates me now, he was practically my best friend and I care about him alot.. Thanks Shadon for fucking up my friendship with the cutest troll on the server... The friends I do still have are pissed at you, and luckily, there are still more than I thought there was. Zarshae, if you read this, and I still havnt given you that 1k I owe you, I will give the diamond to Cammile and have her give it to you next time you see her around, ok? If I'm going to quit I'm going to give Azhar my prized possesion that has never left my inventory since level 5, and my very first gift from EQ. Cammile is going to have my account, since her and Gilgamel share one, I'll give her my characters. So, if indeed I do end up quitting I'll post it on this flame and so you know to leave Cammile alone when she's on Lendari. I did give the fungi tunic to Matril, and I hope he's happy with it (he is the shaman from my group that night). Still havn't thought of who to give my gebs to though...... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ulendariquisalas.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lendari Quisalas</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#E9D756>(6/12/01 6:45:11 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Lendari</span><hr size=1> ok Falon, this one's for you.<br>

I'd like to know what I did to you, because obviously, you're the only one who does. I havn't done anything to you at all that would make you bitch me out like that and you know it. In fact I've helped you a little. All I did was leave IH because at the time I could not stand Mark.

Actually you got into a little ghey fight with him when you were jerking Matt around. Then you played me for an idiot and tried to get me on your side by being the manipulative twit you are and putting a guilt trip on me. After that retarded escapade, which I have screenshots, you were going to be removed from the guild, but I guess you found out about it and quit so we couldn't humiliate you. Um not to mention the fact that you feel so superior that IH wouldn't be here without you. Forget you said that? I didn't. Don't act like you don't know how you are. Shall we post the link to the lovely poll you put up for yourself? I believe it wasn't long after that that you deleted your char, only to have it reinstated somehow a month, maybe two later?<br>
<br>
Go ahead and quit <b>again</b>.

I was simply telling you 'what you did to me' to solicit the bitching. And yes, my dear, a guilt trip is exactly what it is.<br>

<br>
If you don't see your own words being used to make Shadon feel guilty, you need to seek some help because you are seriously deluded.<br>
<br>
It's also neat how you toss in ROFL and lol to make everyone else think this means nothing to you, when actually, your reputation in EQ is probably the only thing you have.<br>
<br>
Bleh I was going to go into more detail about how you're going to conveniently pay people and give them this and that, making yourself seem so nice and wonderful so you can fool our readers. That's called manipulation. But I'm too tired to pull your quotes. People can see it for themselves.<br>
