I have thought about posting this thread a long time ago but just never got around to it. But im at work bored out of my A$$ so here it goes. I know that what I will say will undergo much criticism but here goes. I always hear and see people putting down Necros in terms of group effectiveness. I believe that this is a very biased opinion and one which is totally unjust. I know that Necros are amazing soloers but I hold firm to the belief that they are extremely effective in groups as well. People say that they have no role or real use but this is BS. Granted we are not Wizards, nuking for k's of HP, yet for post 50 necro, with our Ignite bones and chill bones spells I can can more or less keep up with a Wizard in terms of dmg while saving much more mana. The above spells cost me so little mana in a typical fight I can cast it like 4 times and be ready for the next mob. Sure it builds aggro but with a damage shield I can afford this as the tanks will be able to taunt the mob off me quickly, but incase I do get hit, as long as I stay alive I can just deflux for 315 hp and get it all back while at the same time killing the mob further. In extreme cases I can FD or memory wipe/stun the mob and be safe.<br>
This i believe makes Necros very affective as they do a lot of damage. There are soo many good points of Necro's in groups. We can mini mezz. I have held OS camps with me being the mezzer. Granted nothing like Disco and such but jail, bridges and other areas I can be the main mezzer. Plus if chanter gets killed, goes LD, we necro's can meen the difference between a group wipe out. DOTS I dont have to talk about as we can do great dmg rather quickly making us effective in that sense too. WE have snare combined with a low level dot, root. Which makes us effective parkers and snarers(dont mind the spelling , <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ) Healing, Necros are pretty effective healers too. We can do a nice 600 hp heal in about 8 secs(over time) and also back that up with a 300 hp heal instantly, thats close to 1k fairly quickly. All at low mana cost. then we just steal those hp back from mob(damaging it) and do it again, very effective in my opinion. If things go bad e can summon your corpses from hell knows where. MAna transferring, heck i have saved many groups by giving mana to clerics/chanters when they were oom. Our pets, they do a very nice amount of damage. MY rogue pet hits for triple 50's and backstabs for over about 130 hp. As long as the owner of the pet knows how to properly take care of the pet and keep /taunt off then this makes pets very effective. So between us nuking dotting, mezzing, healing at times and pets killing, we can do some amazing suff in groups. I am usually the main snarer in groups, back up mezzer many many things. Necros never need to be healed, we always have mana and I believe we are very useful in groups. It just takes skill on the players part to do justice to this class. I have played many classes and find that in comparison to them, we are unjustly protrayed. I know that i will get flamed on this post by many of you, and dumb replies will be posted such as <br>
&quot;Necros= SUCKS!!&quot; keep that $hit to yourself and just post replies with half a thought behind them. Let me hear what you think.<br>

That's 90 percent of the battle for necros.<br>
<br>
Like druids, necros tend to be soloists.  A lot of necros (and druids) don't even know what a lot of their spells do, or how those spells could be used in a group.  You do.<br>
<br>
Like bards, necros have unusual spells that other players don't understand.  A lot of necros (and bards) do a poor job of explaining what their spells do, or how those spells benefit the group.  You can explain it.<br>
<br>
You should do just fine in groups. <p>Sagemon Prayeth<BR>

<br>
I think they fall down when most of their exp has been soloing so they are not as effective in a group cause they do not know how to most effectively help the group,not cause there is a problem with the class per se...  And those same necros always end up breaking mez with their pets...<br>

That all said, I love to have necros in my group, as long as that person is used to hunting in group-type situations...<br>

Both are problems of perception.  The first, lack of knoweldge of the necromancer is covered by Sagemon.  I would only add that necromancers have the &quot;standard group&quot; mentality working against them.  The standard group (and I swear some people won't group if they don't have this) is 2 tanks, 1 cleric, one other healer type, 1 enchanter, and 1 other damage caster.  So necros only get one slot anyway, and when it comes to fill that slot the &quot;standard group&quot; would rather fill it with a class with demonstrated damage out put (wizard or mage) compared to this DoT, lifetapping thing that doesn't do that much damage anyway.<br>
<br>
The second is the first (second and third) experiences players can have with necromancers.<br>
<br>
There are a lot of jerks in EQ.  They know it all (in their minds), they don't think beyond themselves, they don't play well with others, etc.  For the group dependent classes, their is a natural screen process.  They need to group and thus either learn and grow up, get frustrated and quit, or make such a bad name for themselves that they can't get groups.  This natural screening process, though, doesn't work for the dedicated soloer.  We have all seen innumberable threads against &quot;dr00ds&quot;, the jerk sub-class of druids.  The same thing, though without the catchy name (n3cr0s maybe?), happens to necromancers.  They solo their way through many many levels...don't learn group skills...and are pains to begin with.  Thus, for many people (myself included), their first encounter with a necromancer is a very unpleasant one.  This isn't to say that every necromancer (or druid for that matter) sucks.  Hardly!  The problem is one of a few spoiling the bunch.<br>
<br>
So add those two things together.  When a class has a public perception of being &quot;a royal pain to work with&quot; as well as &quot;they can't really do anything anyway&quot; then you got a problem.  Unfortunately how does one necromancer try and sway public perception?  It's not fun, I tell you.  You need to be not only a good adventurer, but diplomatic as well.  Explain how you can benefit the group (as you do here) and then be a good team player.  My first necro experience, was a nightmare, as was my second.  My third however was eye opening.  So THAT is what that class can do.  Neat!<br>
<br>
My last thought is avoid the zones that gravitate the unimaginative.  Tried tactics only zones where people XP grind without actually trying anything fun (i.e. the newbie&gt;EC&gt;WC&gt;Oasis&gt;LoIO&gt;OT&gt;D L&gt;KC&gt;OS&gt;Velks progression, unless this is changing with Luclin) are going to have a lot of the &quot;standard tactics&quot; types.  Go instead to zones off the beaten track where people are more likely to go with unorthadox tactics.<br>
<br>
I hope no one here takes this as a flame (except as a flame against jerks in the game...it might well be that ;)  ).  There are cruddy necros and druids out there.   There are also cruddy mages, clerics, enchanters, wizards, paladins, rangers, warriors, monks, shadow knights, rogues, bards and shamans (haven't met any cruddy beast lords yet. ;)  that I will avoid grouping with.  There are also amazing druids and necromancers I would group with in a second!  When it comes to a group its not the class, race, or equipment, it's the person.  After that, everything is secondary.<br>

Yes you need some of those but not all that stuf typically. I mean grouping becomes so dry, different classes make it more fun and some combinations are amazing and end up killing faster or whatnot. Variety is good adn I just wish people would not be such pricks about Druids, Necros, Bards. I respect every class and know that all classes have their strenghts and weaknesses and I just wish people were more openminded and actually thought a bit before they said things or flamed classes.<br>

Well that depends on the situation.<br>
<br>
We can do more DPS than a 60 rogue with an epic on any long fight (assuming spells land)... however you won't find that fight in a group situation... we can however do respectable damage in a normal group fight.<br>
<br>
We can buff the group and debuff the mob.<br>
<br>
We can snare - our snare does damage by the way.<br>
<br>
We can mez up to 2 mobs at a time - and we can backup mez for an enchanter - their mez overwrites ours now so if the chanter is being hit we can mez the mob and save a life.<br>
<br>
We can heal - Pact of Shadow + Shadowbond = ~1k hps over 30 seconds - this is almost as good as a celestial elixer - it costs the necro 20 mana to cast these spells as they eat his own health to heal another.<br>
<br>
We can heal ourselves - nuff said.<br>
<br>
We can fiegn - need to break a necro mez?  He fiegns and you can hit the mob without all that taunting.  - Or he can cast a dot lifetap and the mob can hit him for a few rounds without any real harm - letting the tanks move on when they are ready without danger to a caster.<br>
<br>
We can charm undead - this is very usefull in undead dungeons - I can keep 3 mobs busy with 1 charm and 2 mez'd - and even put the charmed one on another mob for a total of 4 mobs under controll.<br>
<br>
We have a pet - this pet is proven to do damage - and alot of it in a typical group situation.  The pet can't tank sure - but you are definatly getting melee output from a pet.<br>
<br>
We can res - yes it's a horrible cost to do it - but would you rather have a huge cr or a cleric that is up and able to res everyone?<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Yes we can solo - do you think that if we can solo those Krup knights in OS that we are not going to be doing a decent amount of damage in a group?<br>
<br>
My group got wiped in Necrosis a few weeks back - I kept the bugs clear while they came back for a CR - The big problem with necros are that a well played necro doesn't do anything that stands out.  Most of our spells are subtle and act behind the scenes... you don't see big crit messages or instatly see half the mobs hps go down, but we are insidious in that aspect... we operate behind the scenes to make the party run smooth... I've had clerics tell me to stop healing because they are bored.  Play with a necro and be prepared to be amazed.<br>

<br>
Crypt is dead on though, necromancers up until *very* recently were pointless on raids.  Summon corpses and give your mana to clerics/wizzies! Oh yay, what fun.  All necromancer spells were either full resist (lifetaps, MR DoTs) or very very high resist (I once landed Pyrocruor on Klandicar.... out of 12 tries).<br>
<br>
On a long fight necros can out-damage a 60 epic rogue? I have no idea who you are or how high-end you play EQ, but 60 epic rogues will absolutely destroy necro DPS/DPM (over a longer period of time).  Talking about long fights you should really measure it in DPM and as far as I remember a necro can hit around 8k damage in one minute, but not consecutively the next.<br>
<br>
I don't know what SoL has done for necros, but i do know we weren't worth shit on raids and worth little more (unless very well played) in xp groups.<br>
<br>
I did like playing necro, I was just fed up with not being able to play an active part in raids.  Xp groups in general were boring because not many people had any guts.  Best group was shortly after the release of RoK, we had 1 war 1 pal 2 rog 1 cle and me (nec).  Slow was down to the rogue proccing, crowd control me and offtanking on the pally.  We had the Sebilis crypt empty with 5 minutes to spare on spawn and didn't have a single death the whole time.  This is a case where necro was a good group member.  Now add an enchanter to the group.  Up until recently necro mezz had a higher priority than enchie mezz.  Enchies couldn't control anything if the necro was trying to be helpful and it mezzed a mob.  You become a low-rent nuker with a pet (famous for causing more harm than good - most people blame trains on the pet being uncontrollable, it's usually because the necro has no clue where to stand or what to do and hides behind the pet).<br>

Funeral Pyre 40dps<br>
Splurt 25dps<br>
Vexing 21dps<br>
Pyro 18dps<br>
Pet 30dps (guess)<br>
----------------------------<br>
134 dps<br>
<br>
That's 8k dmg a minute - not using all our dots and by timing your dot's its sustainable - use demi lich (assuming regrowth on the necro and all dots landing) a necro can keep this up forever without going OOM.<br>
<br>
Agro?  That's what fiegn is for - Rogues have the same problem they evade - only thing is we keep doing dmg when we fiegn.<br>
<br>
Sure I'm talking about a perfect situation - but no other caster can make this claim. (with perhaps the exception of DB, GB fights and lvl 60 wizards with these spells)<br>
<br>
The problem with necros on raids isn't that we don't do dmg - its:<br>
<br>
A) our dot's don't report dmg so we don't get the 'ooh and ahh' of crits and super tanks<br>
<br>
b) two necros can not stack dmg - two rogues can.<br>
<br>
If dot's stacked on mobs there would be no problem on raids for necros.<br>
<br>
Now assuming that those dot's stick we can also lifetap and other nifty things.  If you have Lifeburn I wager you can even keep up with a rogue 'duelist' disc.<br>
<br>
But those are my feelings on the matter - I don't have a jones when it comes to damage (other than the fact that casters should on average be able to far outpace melee dmg due to low ac/hps they are forced to go through) I love the necro class.<br>
<br>
*shrug*<br>
<br>
As for XP groups - well that's where we shine.<br>
<br>
In a perfect world Verant would figure out DPS for all casters and balance us against melee.  I don't ever see it happening though.<br>

<br>
The point isn't the past it's now - and it's not SoL that made us better.  Resist changes help but there is very little we can not land *something* on - we have every type of damage in the game (fire, cold, magic, disease, and poison) and a pet to fall back on when that doesn't add up.<br>
<br>
Many times not landing spells is a debuff issue - with the changes they made that let you know if a mob is IMMUNE to spells I've found most of my casting issues are not a case of a mob being immune - only that I need to debuff a bit more.<br>
