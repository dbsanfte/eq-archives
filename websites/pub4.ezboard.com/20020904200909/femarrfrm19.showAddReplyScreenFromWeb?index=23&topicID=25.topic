<br>
I was trying to point out that playing a game that requires an amount of strategy in RvR. If you take a break, or if you don't play all the time, you won't be able to get practiced well enough to take out battle hardened people. Okay, lemme sum it up.<br>
<br>
Warrior 1 fights some times, he doesn't practice swinging his sword, he can't hit as well. He doesn't know all the ways he can be attacked and what every spell every other player has and how to counteract them.<br>
<br>
Now here comes Warrior 2. He fights all the time, he studies the enemy. He spends half his day practicing new ways to slice and dice. He knows how to fight in a battle and has alot of experience.<br>
<br>
Now they meet, and fight. Who the fuck is gonna win?<br>
<br>
For those of you who think warrior 1 because he's just naturaly good at being a warrior. You are fucked in the head. There has never been on Earth a person that could take down a Navy Seal just because he has the mind set of one already and enjoys being a Navy Seal alot.<br>
<br>
No unpracticed person can compare to someone who has trained in every way to kick your ass.<br>
<br>
practice makes perfect the saying goes. This is true even in games, bike riding, running, swimming, ettiqute. And any other fucking thing you can think of. If you do not have any physical or mental handicaps .You can do ANYTHING if you practice enough. <br>
<br>
Time spent in the field, is time practiced. Someone who doesn't do this all the time is going to lose to the one that did.<br>
<br>
Now, let's repeat to get the point across. A large uberguild and it's uberguild ally's will steamroll any not so well organized groups attempt to kill them. PERIOD<br>
<br>
Just because this group of inexperienced fighters may be &quot;naturally better at the game&quot; doesn't mean shit to guys with that much more experience under their belt, god damn.<br>

<br>
Why can  &quot;Uber-Guild A&quot; take out Naggy say while a pick-up raid fails?<br>
<br>
Because the people in UGA are focused and have dicipline.<br>
<br>
I dont know how many pick-up naggy raids in the past I've seen fail because so and so fell into the lava/was playing with the bridge/was oom at the pull/was afk/wandered off in the wrong direction/agroed naggy early/forgot to bring thier resist gear/etc/etc/etc.<br>
<br>
This stuff NEVER happens with a top orginized guild.<br>
<br>
This almost ALWAYS happens with a pick-up raid.<br>
<br>
I think in RvR it will even show the difference between the casual player (read not Diciplined) and the Uber player (read Diciplined). <br>
<br>
I think a real world example is in order, lets say you take a unit of Elite Marines who train for battle every day.<br>
<br>
Put them at the end of a field.<br>
<br>
Now take a unit of National Guard who only practice being soldiers on every third weekend and put them at the other end.<br>
<br>
Give them equil equipment.<br>
<br>
and let them play capture the flag....<br>
<br>
Who do you think is going to win, every time.<br>
<br>
Now you say the guards will get better, yes. BUT so will the marines, they won't be standing still and will always be ahead of the guards.<br>
<br>
Another point, I'm not sure how much equipment makes a difference in DaoC but you know the leets will always have the best gear.<br>

PS Glurg, the ONLY reason there are Pick-up raids on the two dragons is because of the 52 or boot rule, its been a long standing joke in the top guilds that we should level up a bunch of twinks to 52 and take them over again <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ugurglespitfruggybasher.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gurglespit Fruggybasher</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://dyce.i8.com/gurblip.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 1297<br> <font color=#E9D756>(11/9/01 11:33:41 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=25.topic&index=26>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Conquest and Da'kor of Merlin</span><hr size=1> I was in a pickup raid on naggy last night.. we only lost one person and that was the chanter who suicide tashed (ran in at the beginning and chain casted tash till it stuck then switched to slow trying to get it to stick..)<br>
<br>
I know the uberguilds are going to be stronger.. but the point I am trying to make is there are what.. 50 people maybe in conquest.. and maybe 20 people in da`kor (rough estimates..)  that is 70 hardcore people.. now how many people are on the merlin server at peak times?? I usually see near 2000.  So the other we divide the 2000 by 3 and we get 667 per realm.. so there are 1200 other people that will be up there and able to fight against da`kor and  conquest eventually (granted it will take time) <br>
<br>
Now using that same analogy you used.. you take 70 marine special forces and put them at one end of the field and you take 1200 national guard on the other end.. you still think those 70 marines are gonna waltz in and take the flag?? they have to get through a thousand people.. while still guarding thier own.. <br>
<br>
and if you are thinking... well what about he 600 other merlin people.. sure they may be able to help the 70 ubers.. but then again there will be some &quot;ubers&quot; mixed in with the 1200 others as well.. it will all even out as all the casual gamers level up and the &quot;ubers&quot; won't make as big of a difference as I think most people are thinking they will<br>

In Myth you had series of games where troop selection, tactics, teamwork were extremely important. Beyond that micro managment defined the top few players and clans from the rest. In a sense Daoc is similar because the PVP requires the same decisions to be made. However in Daoc you will have inbalances in troo numbers. Tactics and teamwork are extremely important as is micro management.<br>
<br>
I went for my first RvR experience last night and well got owned. It was good for the experience because I had no real knowledge of what the landscape was and who I was fighting. We didn't have tactical battle plans so of course we were going to get owned. People who play more will always have the advanteg because more experience will give you an advantage. What Tuan is saying that there is also a difference between players in skill and most of that is determined by your ability to take advantage of your advantage or be able to understand the scenario as it layed out for you. <br>
<br>
It looks like RvR would actually be much more fun with 300+ people on each side. Lag of course would be an issue but the battles will be long and require detailed planning and excution. You won't blindly stumble into taking a keep as easy as it may seem now. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/utrechdashadowknight.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Trech Da ShadowKnight</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 414<br> <font color=#E9D756>(11/9/01 2:42:05 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=25.topic&index=28>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Conquest and Da'kor of Merlin</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> I was in a pickup raid on naggy last night<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
