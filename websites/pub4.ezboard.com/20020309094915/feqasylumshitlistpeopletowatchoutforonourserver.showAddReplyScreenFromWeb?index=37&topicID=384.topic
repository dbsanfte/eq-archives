<br>
I am not saying that the original post is valid or not.  I am only saying something in imho for Dirtt.<br>
<br>
I can not speak for Jademist as i do not know him and have not talked to him.<br>
<br>
What Dirtt said was rash and rude in nature yes, but we all lose our temper from time to time.  I believe this was one of them.  I have urged Dirtt to post what he said to me and hope he does so.  It puts what he siad into more of a context.  His version, while adding some things, does not conflict with the stated version.  It went far in showing me that this unfortunate incident, while serious in nature, is perhaps not as bad a reflection on Dirtt as it at first seems.<br>
<br>
I was also told by Dirtt that his past episodes or shizophrenic behavior with the character of Dirtt are at an end.  With this in mind I look forward to further grouping with Dirtt as I know him, as on the whole I have found him to be a good player.<br>

<br>
I always thought the shit list was here to warn other players of crappy people you run into. <br>
Example: <br>
Someone SLs me. <br>
Says &quot;That Illithsid! He ninja looted my rusty dagger! Then he trained 40 orc pawns on me and laughed! I lost a full bubble of exp because I was 46 at the time!&quot;<br>
<br>
Then someone else gets on and says <br>
&quot;Yeah! He trained orcs on me too! And he gravity fluxed my dog! Poor rover. /cry&quot;<br>
<br>
Now people know that I do bad stuff like orc pawn training, and they know to keep thier dog away from me. <br>
<br>
They could talk to my guild and get me disbanded from it, but that doesn't warn all the peeps I could still potentially hurt. If people have a heads up on me they know to keep an eye out for me. <br>
<br>
Thats what I use the shit list for anyway. <br>
I've seen several people on the SL in game and I know to keep my eye out for them. I don't go running around screaming &quot;HELP HELP SOANDSO WAS SHIT LISTED AND HES STANDING WITHIN 50 FEET OF ME!!!&quot; But if they start doing something suspicious. (IE Run up to a camp in a dungeon that I'm in, stand around, start pulling stuff.) I know to warn my group. &quot;Get rdy for quick evac, this guy is known for training.&quot; Or 'Loot the nameds quickly, I heard this guy will ninja stuff.&quot; And now my group is prepared so if he does try something funny, we can get the hell out before that train kills us. (or whatever) <br>
<br>
But I also believe in redemption. So I give ANYONE a chance first. Who knows? They might be able to turn thier Rep around and become a great player! <br>

I told him what really happened, which was my friend Jademist send me a tell when I was camping ice giants in everfrost, I left my group to power level him, he told me in a tell that we had the guard group and the raider room, so i thought ok, i could level him out of hell(35), so I proceeded omw to Highkeep, I got there and he was low on health so i buffed him up and healed, then i pulled the raider room one by one for him to kill, once we did that he said he already broke the guard room spawn, and it was up again so we went to do that, and on the way there the warrior room stair pop, aggro'd him, so he took it in the room and it was beating his brains out and he said to them, happy birthday warrior room, here is a present for you, and he stood there letting it beat him while they got up and ready to kill it, last time i check that wasn't called training someone.  Nevertheless the warrior group persisted in telling me to not train them or ks them, so I was getting really irritated that they kept saying that when we weren't doing anything remotely close to that.  After a while we got into it in /say mode, and about 4 of them kept saying a bunch of crap and wouldn't listen to me, then they said ok time to petition this loser, then by this point you could imaging how mad I was, that's when the line everyone's talking about came out, &quot;you newbies mean dick to me&quot; the reason I said that is because at the time I was furious that they would not listen to what I had to say.  Then the GM came and proceeded to tell me I couldn't camp the whole zone and he had been watching me the whole time, which was an outright lie, he hadn't been there because if he had he would know I haven't been camping the whole zone, how can you camp a whole zone when you don't kill one thing and everything is dying? so I told him to shut up and leave, that he was a bad example of a gm, and should be fired, I didn't post about the GM before because it doesn't really matter about this post, even though it shouldn't of happened.

Hmmmmmmm now I'm starting to wonder.  No Druid of this level should be PLing someone in HH anyway its not the area for that, it's too crowded and too controversial.  If you are going to PL someone then go somewhere where it won't be disruptive to other players that are just trying to level on their own.<br>
  Also I noticed his sig as UBER DROOD, this tells me alot about him also, not something I would EVER associate MY druid with.  That expression makes me sick and and reminds me of the druids that everyone is always bitching about here on the message boards.<br>

<br>
Does anyone even REMEMBER the origional post?<br>
<br>
Everyone has their own opinion, I started this post because there was a PL'er (not illegal unto itself) who came over to our camp and THREATHENED us that he would KS us and ruin our camp because he thought that we were &quot;stealing his spawns&quot; from the multiple camps they had upstairs.  (which is AFTER they had driven away all the other groups of players that were trying to camp there) Because in his honest opinion &quot;you newbies don't mean dick to me&quot;  I even have the logs where he started KS'ing a pickclaw right after, that we had started fighting.<br>
<br>
[Sun Jan 21 22:35:34 2001] a pickclaw warrior slashes Tashmire for 3 points of damage.<br>
[Sun Jan 21 22:35:34 2001] a pickclaw warrior slashes Tashmire for 3 points of damage.<br>
[Sun Jan 21 22:35:36 2001] Tashmire slashes a pickclaw warrior for 25 points of damage.<br>
[Sun Jan 21 22:35:36 2001] Tashmire slashes a pickclaw warrior for 17 points of damage.<br>
[Sun Jan 21 22:35:36 2001] a pickclaw warrior is bathed in starfire.<br>
[Sun Jan 21 22:35:36 2001] a pickclaw warrior slashes Dirtt for 26 points of damage.<br>
[Sun Jan 21 22:35:39 2001] a pickclaw warrior slashes Dirtt for 46 points of damage.<br>
[Sun Jan 21 22:35:39 2001] a pickclaw warrior slashes Dirtt for 46 points of damage.<br>
<br>
(and FYI yes i know Tashmire can be a dick - but he IS a fair player - this thread is NOT about him)<br>
<br>
THEN when we petition that this guy is threatening us and KS'ing to the GM, who was there the entire time and watching all this happen comes in and asks Dirtt to PLEASE share the zone with other groups AND that this was not the first time that they had recieved this kind of complaint about him {that part of the log was truncated from the first post to the 2nd post, but the first half of the sentance is there }<br>
<br>
[Sun Jan 21 22:39:29 2001] Alderwolf says, 'I've been watching you and Jadewind. Takeing this whole zone has caused a disruption and it's not the first time your;ve done it'<br>
[Sun Jan 21 22:40:44 2001] Alderwolf says, 'Pleaes stop causeing a disruption with your mouth Dirtt and play nice k'<br>
<br>
So he looks at the GM and tells him to &quot;shut up&quot; because he has no idea what he is talking about.  The gm didn't just teleport in and slap his wrist he had been there for at least 20 minutes watching what was going on and we had 3 other GM's on tell looking into the situation at the same time.<br>
<br>
After that the trains start - figuring if he (Jademist) kills us off they can have the warrior and/or raider room too, which by the way is much better XP and XP is the name of the game when you are PL'ing someone.<br>
<br>
NOW - perhaps Dirtt had no idea that this was happening becuase Jademist was pulling and Dirtt thought that he had the Raider room.  <br>
<br>
Perhaps he thought we were stealing the Raider room spawn - which meant FYI that they were controlling the hi-room spawn, the lo-room spawn, the stair and hallway spawn AND the raider spawn.  Leaving us with the 3 pop warrior spawn.<br>
<br>
We all play this game for fun - we all WANT to have fun. If someone /petitions to a GM because someone is not playing by the RULES or even being decent enough to SHARE and then starts using threats and intimidation and THEN refuses to abide by the GM's decision - then what? <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Would YOU put them on the shit list?<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The Shit List is like the Stockades, you are displayed to the whole community and chained to the town square.  We don't CARE if your Uncle Ed was playing your character when he Ninja Looted something, yea - maybe you WERE having a bad day, or your dog died or something.  The point is the GM's have the final say.<br>
<br>
But when a GM' tells you that this isn't the first time you have done this, and to stop, do you tell him to shut up?<br>
<br>
If you are playing baseball and the referee makes a &quot;bad call&quot;  you either swallow it down or you get thrown out of the game.<br>
<br>
I think this list serves it's own purpose - many people who play don't even know this list exists and have valid issues against players.  If they happen to find this list and see a post where someone else has had problems with a character, they can chime in too, and not feel like they were the only ones who felt this way.<br>
<br>
And maybe if someone is having a bad day and takes it out on alot of other people trying to have FUN - perhaps this is a wake up call to &quot;fly straight&quot; and they never get listed again.<br>
<br>
Only time will tell for an instance like that.<br>
<br>
Just don't get Shit Listed again<br>
