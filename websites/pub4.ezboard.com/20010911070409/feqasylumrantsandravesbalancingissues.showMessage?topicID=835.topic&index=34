<br>
my first day in greater faydark, chatting with a high lvl barbarian warrior, only to have him at the end of our chat hand over 50pp to me for the wonderful chat.  i thought... so this is how it works <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
summoning my first pet at lvl 4 and just thinking... wow, there is two of me fighting together, this is going to be way too easy!  then going to a red con orc and seeing my pet die in about three seconds, then me shortly after... and getting a nice reality check there...<br>
<br>
at lvl 10 or so, joining my very first guild, inevitable storm i believe it was.  i remember rayvenn (who was ozmolati at the time) and sytar, a fellow magician.  sytar was around lvl 30, and became a true mentor to me, always helping me and giving me advice about the class...<br>
<br>
receiving a tell at lvl 14 from sytar asking me to come to lake rathe, he had a gift for me.  running from freeport to lake rathe... running through the middle of kithicor at night, when everyone said not to... my hands trembling, nervous with anticipation about death and the reward... then him handing to me in lake rathe a skull of jen'thra.  and all i could think was... omg this owns, i am high lvl now <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
receiving a gift of a flowing black robe, my first uber robe.  and going crazy, and everyone going crazy as well as to how cool it looked.<br>
<br>
being spammed with guild invites by estopidiera in lake rathe around lvl 28 or so.  i kept on telling her that i needed to check out the guild website before i made the decision, but her persistency over the next 48 hours made me join the shadow order.<br>
<br>
grouping with muros, xian, binaf, erinal, estopidiera, adarius, and veneal for so so many levels.  we hung out in kunark all the time.  remembered when xian finally got her first crescent armor in dalnir... the wild corpse recoveries we had to do on the second level... then heading to burning woods.  looking at the first wurm up close... and my jaw dropped.  the sheer size of it!  of course, at lvl 35 it wiped the group cleanly... but the fact that we attempted a replica of a dragon was soooooo cool...<br>
<br>
meeting pimm in the oceans of tears while i solo'ed seafuries in a frantic haste to reach lvl 46.  him asking me why i was using the lvl 44 fire pet, and telling him my research was not high enough to get the lvl 44 earth one.  then him graciously researching all my pet spells for me, something that to this day i still don't forget /hug pimm.  then, the magical tell... when pimm invited me to my very first raid, in the plane of hate.<br>
<br>
i remembered my heart pounding as i wrote down the notes that pimm gave as to how to get to camp.  i remember running along the walls, but not too high... always lookin around me for mobs, and when i got to camp, just jumpin out of my chair in sheer happiness <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
when rhuarck loaned me about 10k of money so i could purchase a glowing black stone, at the time one of *the* premiere caster items, almost like a status item.  and then the next day, seeing the drachnid widow in the dreadlands up, asking for help and slaying the beast, and looting the drachnid thyxil..... and the transformation to cheerleader began.<br>
<br>
the first open server sky raid.  comprised of some of lanys' finest players.  being told by members of soul assassins that our raid would not get past the first island.  being told that for us to attempt noble dojorn was a raid wipeout waiting to happen.  proving all those nay-sayers wrong by clearing all the islands up to bee island, including spiroc isle... one of the most memorable events of my gaming career.<br>
<br>
stip trying to split the spirocs on that island, but could not do so.  then going on three suicide runs to get it down to just the lord and guardian... me going ld all weekend long, much to my dismay... the infamous golden efreeti bp debate that happened when i was ld for o so long <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ... eyed completing the staff quest up there... all the spirocs on sunday coming at us all at once, what a picture that was... and noggel, o loveable noggel... jumping and landing on a chain.  omg i was so worried at first about him gettin his stuff... then when he did, i don't remember laughing as hard as i did /cheer noggel <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
being in a lousy mood one day, and being invited by inner fire to growth plane, and winning the roll over morganth for the second server robe of conjuration... one of the coolest looking robes in the game... and after thinking of possibly leaving the game, only to win such a prestigious item at that time... made everything wrong seem to pale with that robe... and the good people that i was with that night...<br>
<br>
receiving guild invites to join both dark trinity and visions when they first formed.  even though it seemed small... both karsys and ellyria/nevyr/gryvin/etc etc wanted me to join their new, fresh-start guilds.  i felt very wanted, i felt like i had &quot;made it&quot; to the pinnacle of my class.. that my peers recognized my talents and abilities, and thought of me as a strong player with a cheerful personality... it made me feel really good about myself, and i never really did thank karsys/bolavin and the officers of visions for making me feel that way those two days.<br>
<br>
then politely and graciously saying no to both applications, because my spot belongs with my family... the shadow order, a guild that through good times and bad has always been there for me... people have come and go, but the core structure, and the core unit, has always been there... and it is the online family that i have grown with to love both the positive and the negatives with... there indeed is love there, and the memories and happy/sad days can never be taken away from me...<br>
<br>
being invited by visions to a trakanon raid, and in quite simply one of the greatest &quot;ownings&quot; i have ever been a part of, rushing trak's lair with guardian, jumpy, and about 6-8 prots all around.  seeing trakanon die in about four seconds, then picking off the rest of them... and i think we had maybe a couple deaths when all was said and done... never have i been part of something that i honestly did not think could be done, and then to do it so smoothly and without error was just amazing...<br>
<br>
i remember the good times, and the bad.  the game has indeed been a strong part of myself for the past 130 days... hopefully i can look past some things that have been said to me/my character over the past week or so and continue to enjoy the game that i really love so dearly <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
