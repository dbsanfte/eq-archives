Not paying attention and screwing around causes more raids to fail than anything else.  If you are too much of an annoyance you will be asked to leave.  It will be late when this raid is taking place so the less time it takes the better.<br>
<br>
Vox strategy,<br>
<br>
When Vox is called try to get there asap everyone who is going to go. <br>
<br>
DO NOT PULL THE ICE GIANTS AND PLAY WITH THEM UNTIL RAID IS READY. LEAVE EVERYTHING BEHIND THE DOUBLE DOORS ALONE!<br>
<br>
WAIT FOR THE RAID LEADER TO CALL FOR THE GO AHEAD.<br>
<br>
Once IG's and roaming mobs are clear everyone will move down to buff hall.<br>
<br>
While waiting in line make sure all your existing buffs are down, ask someone to dispell you if you can't knock them off yourself. You will not self buff yourself, you will be buffed by others. This is usually the longest period of time you will have to wait, relax have a coke watch for the signal to come back. It can sometimes take an hour to get everyone buffed. (But I will try to not let this take very long)<br>
<br>
 <br>
STAY OFF THE RAMPS! Do not advance until the raid leader says too.<br>
<br>
Clerics use superior heal and not CH, CH will get you summoned and killed. Try to stay just within heal range of your tanks and not too close to the fight. When not healing sit down to reduce your chances of being feared. Set a key telling your favorite Druid &quot;HEAL ME&quot; just incase you need it. The fight is fast you probably won't need it but it's always nice to have the back up.<br>
<br>
All casters you have to be in melee range for your spells to have effect, the best place to be is right under Lady Vox's butt. Stick your head up her arse if ya can it's the most efficient. Enchanters, MANA SIEVE, MANA SIEVE, MANA SIEVE, casters NUKE, NUKE, NUKE! Casters should be bound in buff hall, if you die load up your one best nuke and run back in and try to get the killing shot<br>
<br>
Resists are a very important part of Vox. If you want the best chance of resisting fear or her dragon breath, your cold and magic resist must be a minimum of 90 (recommended 100) before any buff is casted on you.<br>
<br>
DO NOT PULL THE Ice Giants. What most do not realize is that these are on a shorter spawn timer than the Fire Giants in Sol B on the way to Nagafen. I DON’T WANT BACKSPAWN. Impatience is not a virtue.<br>
<br>
<br>
Strategy:<br>
First of all, anyone w/ the ability to bind will do so in the buff hall. If you die to Vox, you reappear in the buff hall, mem your best nuke or suggested heal or mana sieve or pet or whatever else real fast and run right back into the fight (if you die more than 3 times, do not run back in).<br>
<br>
Mages and other pet classes can drop reagents on the floor prior to the rush so that if they die, they can pick up a reagent and summon a new pet.<br>
<br>
If she is engaged at the entrance, she will stand there and summon people. Have no doubt, she will follow you back. Once at the back, engage Vox.<br>
<br>
Clerics are to get within healing range of their group and sit down. Please note that you will not be using complete heal. It is too slow of a heal to cast with the amount of damage your group will be taking. I usually recommend one cleric to group heal while the other cleric target heals. The reason for sitting is to keep you medding while you are not healing and to try and stop you from running outside of the room when you are feared (although I've heard they fixed this). I also urge you to use quick heal spells like remedy, celestial, group heals, superior heals.<br>
<br>
Bards will be playing elemental and guardian rhythms with instrument in hand. No meleeing by the bards, just augmenting of resists as best as possible to give the warriors a better chance of living.<br>
<br>
Shamans don't try to slow, it won't land...don't try to nuke, it won't land. Just heal.<br>
<br>
One note for casters, when you are trying to nuke Vox, it is imperative you are within melee range to land the spell. If you are not within melee range, you will see a resist message. The best place for casters to sit is right up underneath her backside. From this area, you have a chance of missing her dragon breath.<br>
<br>
Another special note, Fire spells. Vox is highly immune to cold spells for obvious reasons. She is the master of Permafrost Keep after all. Now, here is the interesting part, since the last patch changed the way spells and resists work, I have no clue on how magic based spells will affect Vox. If so, you've just found another outlet of damage in mages and other magic based nuking classes. Doesn't hurt to try.<br>
<br>
In the end, you should have a dead dragon. If she manages to get a CH off, DO NOT panic...it does happen, keep fighting. It is not a true complete heal, it is only a 10k HP heal. Keep fighting, keep mana sieving, keep doing what you're doing. Even if she gets 2 off and a good majority of your tanks are still alive...keep fighting and mana sieving. <br>
<br>
<br>
There is a Hard Cap at 7 groups if we get enough people.  IF you are asked to leave please don’t be upset.  Too many people makes everyone lag and is harder to manage.  Chances are no one will be asked to leave, just be ready for the possibility.<br>
<br>
One IMPORTANT thing to add. There are NUMEROUS TRAP FLOORS surrounding the ramps and entrance area to Vox's lair. Make note of this and do not run into them. There are a lot of huge polar bears down there that can tear you apart<br>
<br>
Also, if backspawn does occur and you find yourself with an Ice Giant on your tail, use your head. Don't run into Vox's lair expecting help. People are focusing on fighting a dragon and not getting a giant off of you, so don't train the raid with anything at all.<br>
<br>
THE LOOT<br>
<br>
1. Book of Scale - paladin fiery avenger (rolled on by Pally’s only) 52nd level Pallys get 2 #’s for roll<br>

4. Kayruuls Mystic Pouch - 10 SLOT 100% WEIGHT REDUCTION (XL ITEMS) ALL // ALL (Was monk only but I'm changing it because int casters get screwed on dragon raids and they deserve a chance at more than just one item.  I'm sorry monks but int casters are weak too and need some help.  Otherwise it's hard to get them to these raids any way.<br>
So, this bag is monk and int caster rollable)<br>
5. McVaxius' Horn of War - DEX+9 INT+9 CHA+5 // BRD (bards only)<br>

<br>
1. You should be between levels 45 and 52. Clerics as low as 39 (with complete heal) are also useful, but must remember to stay far away from Vox (I personally will be trying to avoid people under 46.  This isn't because you aren't good players, it's because you will have a harder time resisting Vox's AOE's)<br>
2. An unbuffed Magic Resistance of 50 and a Cold Resistance of 100. The higher the better.<br>
3. Bring two peridots: one for cleric and one for enchanter. These will be used for beneficial spells. <br>
I will be bringing Peridots, but wouldn’t hurt if you had your own just in case I don’t have enough.<br>
4. Check with raid leader on how loot will be distributed.<br>
<br>
HOW TO GET THERE<br>
1. Closest Druid portal: Surefall Glades<br>
2. Closest Wizard portal: SE corner of West Karana<br>
3. Timorous Deep fire pot room (-12100, 4200). The pot in the SE corner the brown box with the dagger on it - on the south wall - will transport you onto the docks in Halas. If you attempt this route, just be careful of dragon that occasionally appears near the pot room. This can be a very quick way to get to Halas if you are in near Timorous and have access to SoW and levitate.<br>
<br>
IMPORTANT THINGS TO REMEMBER<br>
1. Vox is a level 55 Dragon with Cleric spells, and will buff herself constantly.<br>
2. Vox's most deadly weapon is her AE cold breath and AE fear spell. Wear as much MR/CR gear as possible; sacrifice all other statistics (yes, even AC) to get these as high as possible. If you are level 52, CR gear is more important that MR gear, because you will resist most of her fears if you have a bard in your group.<br>
3. Check your resist gear. If you don't have much, consider acquiring: 2xPlatinum Peridot Ring (AC4 CR10), Cloak of the Icebear (AC8 HP10 CR20), Rune Boned Fork (MR10 CR10 FR10), Crown of the Froglok King (AC12 CR20 FR20), Velium Round Shield (AC15 CR10), and Gnomish Environmental Suit (AC9 FR10 CR10 PR10). There are a wealth of other items available, especially with the addition of SoV.<br>
4. Many of the mobs in Permafrost have high cold resist - including Vox, use fire based spells where possible for minimum resists.<br>
5. In order to cast any spell on Vox - YOU MUST BE WITHIN HER MELEE RANGE.<br>
<br>
STAGING PHASE<br>
1. When you are in Everfrost or Permafrost, report in to the raid leader.<br>
2. The raid leader may tell you if the raid is short of certain classes. Check with friends if asked.<br>
3. Turn off anonymous when you show up.<br>
4. Assemble near Goblin King for temporary groups (&quot;1&quot; on map below).<br>
5. The raid leader, pullers, and group Leaders will use Shout channel. All other communication should be on the OOC channel.<br>
6. It may take a while for the raid leader to work out final groups and the attack plan, especially if the raid is short of people in critical areas (clerics, enchanters, bards, and nukers).<br>
 <br>
<br>
Killing Ice Giants<br>
This will be done in a timely fashion after I put groups together.  Clerics/Shamans/Druids may buff at this time but please keep mana high as possible to be ready when buff time starts.  Of course HEAL during Ice Giant fights.  Giants cannot be mezzed so enchanters please charm adds or bards will.<br>
<br>
BUFFING PHASE<br>
The buffs should be done in mana/time order to maximize buff time.<br>
  #01 caster - 1 junk buff (e.g. resist fire)<br>
  #02 caster - 1 junk buff (e.g. resist poison)<br>
  #03 caster - 1 junk buff (e.g. resist disease)<br>
  #04 caster - 1 junk buff (e.g. ultravision) - rangers may want to do &quot;call of sky&quot; for stun proc.<br>
  #05 shaman - talisman of altuna - HP238 (250mana - 72min)<br>
  #06 shaman - stamina - STA37 (~100HP) (100 - 63min)<br>
  #07 cleric - shield of words - AC32 (300 - 72min)<br>
  #08 cleric - heroism - AC20 HP400 (140mana - 72min)<br>
  #09 cleric - symbol of naltron - HP525 Peridot (315mana - 54min)<br>
  #10 enchanter - rune IV / V - DMG620/700 Peridot (350mana - 110min)<br>
  #11 enchanter - group resist magic - MR55 (200mana - 36min)<br>
  #12 enchanter - haste / clarity - (185mana - 16min/75mana - 27min)<br>
  #13 druid - circle of summer - group CR45 (150mana - 36min)<br>
  #14 druid - chloro (200mana - 15min)<br>
  #15 open - for bard resist song<br>
1. Turn on WALK. Vox will cast fear, and it is best to be walk mode. If you have run mode on and Vox fears you, you may wind up in the pits. Note: VI changed this code, when feared you will always move at a set speed, therefore, it no longer does any good to turn on walk.<br>
2. When  Leader signals ready any class that has a pet should summon one.<br>
15. If Vox agros or expels people during the buffing phase, someone has Vox agro. The easiest way to clear this is to have everyone camp and come back.<br>
<br>
ASSAULTING VOX<br>
1. Only the raid leader and/or backup leader will shout attack instructions. Smooth raids are ones where everyone knows what to do and follows instructions.<br>
2. [RL: Group 1/2 to rock]. Groups 1 and 2 move up to the rock entering her chamber.<br>
3. [RL: Prepare for attack on the count of 3]. Bards should start to play Elemental Rhythms with a drum (which should add approximately 71MR, 71CR, and 71FR).<br>
4. [RL: Group 1/2 attack]. The main tank groups (1-2) will rush Vox, activate disciplines (if you have them), surround her on all sides, and attack. Bards will not attack with hand-to-hand (insignificant melee damage and Vox ripostes can cause significant damage). The safest place for a bard to fight will be directly below Vox's stomach near her hind legs. If lag is minimal and it is possible, twist Guardian Rhythms ( 71MR and 10AC), or other buffs.<br>
5. If Vox is in the narrow area leading to the rock door, it is critical that the first tank groups push her into the center of the room. If she is in that area, it is the same as if she was stuck on a wall and will CH repeatedly.<br>
6. Healers for the tank groups will remain near the rock entrance at &quot;5&quot;.<br>
7. [RL: Group 3/4 attack. Enc group enter] Once she is in center of room and surrounded on all sides. The other tank groups can enter (groups 3/4) along with the enchanters &amp; shaman and attack. Other groups can move to the rock entrance and wait.<br>
8. If for any reason, you get feared and find yourself in the pits, stay there and die. Do not bring more mobs to the fight.<br>
9. A major key to killing Vox is to not push her onto a wall. IF VOX GETS PUSHED ONTO A WALL SHE WILL STAND THERE, HEAL HERSELF, AND SUMMON PEOPLE. Those that are between Vox and the nearest wall should not taunt. If you are near the wall and are the current agro, move away from the wall.<br>
<br>
EARLY INTO FIGHT<br>
10. [RL: Enchanters dispell now]. Every enchanter should run to Vox and dispel two times to remove all her buffs (remember to stand within melee range). If short on enc, other classes can dispell.  Vox has the old-world max of 32k hitpoints, and the dispels should remove her cleric buffs and will effectively reduce her hitpoints. Each enchanter should OOC &quot;Dispelled&quot; once two successful dispells are complete. Need a minimum of 3 dispellers.<br>
11. Once finished dispelling, enchanters should immediately begin mana sieving her, and continue to sieve until Vox is dead. If short on enchanters (1-2), suggest having any necros feed mana.<br>
12. [RL: Debuf / Slow now].  Once all dispells are done, the debufs should come. Shamans should immediately begin to attempt to slow/debuf Vox and should OOC successes (&quot;Slowed&quot;, &quot;Malosied&quot;, etc). If any 53+ characters are present on the raid, they can attempt to attack/debuf/slow at this time. Bards may consider adding a debuf to twist (1 does fire resist, 1 does magic resist).<br>
13. Necros should avoid spells that turn Vox into a skeleton. This makes it very difficult to find the mob with so many people.<br>
14. Healers should remain near the rock until needed. If there is only a single person in the group taking damage, they should move back to the rock and get a heal. This allows the healers to stay out of Vox's breath range. If a number of people have taken damage, the healer should come to the group. The safest place for a healer to stand is behind Vox outside breath range.<br>
15. Healers should pay particularly close attention to the bard in their group. Bard resistances are preventing an enormous amount of damage, and bards have the fewest HP of all melee/hybrids. Bards are the only class that will not come back to the rock for healing if they are the only one taking damage. Bards are keeping groups alive, keep them alive.<br>
16. Healers/Paladins should call out in OOC any LoH or CH.<br>
<br>
AT 60% HEALTH:<br>
18. [RL: Pets attack now]. Pets are called in to attack.<br>
19. [RL: Tash now]. 1 enchanter should Tash Vox and should OOC &quot;Tashed&quot; if successful. If Vox agros and stays agroed on the enchanter, they should not be healed (hate will be transferred to healer and healer will die). Heal the enchanter if they live. If agroed, the enchanter can use this opportunity to pull Vox into the center of the room.  The risk to enc tashing is rather low by the time Vox has reached the 60 percent mark. <br>
20. [RL: Stun, bash, slam].  Everyone begins chain-stunning, bashing, and slamming Vox. Although, stuns will not actually stun her, it will interrupt her from casting heal spells. Continue to stun her until she is dead. Vox is a cleric AI and will attempt to Complete Heal herself. If she does get one off, it is not the end of the world, it will   heal approximately 5k of hitpoints.<br>
<br>
AT 50% HEALTH<br>
21.[ RL: Nuke now]. Nukes and casters will be called in. Remember to get within melee range or your spell will not land. Melee classes that cannot cast stun should nuke as well. Nuke until Vox is dead.<br>
22. [RL: Reserves Attack now]. Any melee groups held in reserve should attack<br>
23. If a caster dies, memorize critical spells and rejoin the fight. All rezzes will be done when Vox goes down.<br>
24. If a bard is nearly dead and cannot be healed, they can move to center of room and suicide with Denons Desperate Dirge (Vox targeted) for 300+ damage.<br>
<br>
AT 20% HEALTH<br>
25. [RL: Wizards Nuke now]. Wizards are called in at 20% health for nuking.<br>
26. Continue to mana sieve, interrupt, and nuke Vox until dead.<br>
<br>
VOX DEATH<br>
1. Vox's corpse should not decay for 30 minutes until after she dies.<br>
2. If Raid Leader’s group does not get the Experience on Vox NO ONE ELSE LOOTS THE CORPSE.  IF SEEN LOOTING YOU WILL BE PETITIONED!  ALL ITEMS WILL BE ROLLED, THERE IS NO DEFAULTS!<br>
3. No one else should inspect the body. The raid leader will loot and distribute items.<br>
4. All resurrections will be performed at this time. Temporary groups may be assigned with clerics &amp; bards to minimize time. Any bodies from pits will be recovered at this time as well.<br>
5. Nothing will be rolled on until everyone is Resurrected and accounted for.  It’s not fair to roll until everyone that participated is there.<br>

And now, thanks to Luclin, I ought to be able to add about 30 CR and 15 MR to each and every raid member, all in equipment buffs (so no dispelling).<br>
<br>
If you are going on the raid, please make note of: your RANGE slot item, your SHOULDER slot item, and your BACK slot item.<br>
<br>
If you do not have at least 15 CR in your range slot, please bag your item and make room for a Shard of the Core. In addition to the cold resist, you will also have ultravision as long as you hold the item.<br>
<br>
If you do not have at least 15 CR + 15 MR on your shoulder or back slot, please bag the worst of those and make room for an Elemental Blanket. The AC is low, but the resists are outstanding. They are LORE so you can only hold one at a time.<br>
<br>
Again, these are equipment-based buffs, so there are no stacking issues, and they cannot be dispelled. <br>
<br>
I'll try to be there early to start the summoning madness. If for some reason the blanket cannot be cast in Permafrost (the spell can't be cast in some zones), I will try to catch people on the Everfrost side of the tunnel.<br>
