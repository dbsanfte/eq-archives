I am simply going to reprint the best topic I have ever seen on dueling on blue servers to date. It is very thorough and does a good job of explaining how to dual most opponents. I will add one thing however, If you have an opponent with super high magic resistance, tash isnt going to help you. If you are in an area where there are no mobs for you to charm, its best to run and be able to dual another day. <br>
It will be interesting to find out what Verant does for the enchanter BoTB because two enchanters dueling is pretty much lame. It all comes down to who gets the first Rapture off and starts sieving. Beyond that, I can get my magic resistance to 250 easily so no point in even casting directly on me. <br>
Hopefully they will come up with some kind of contest that is really meaningful for enchanters(The same applies to bards. Bard duels are really lame). What do you think would be a good contest?<br>
___________________________________________________________<br>
<br>
Mezzing<br>
Mezmerize line of spells will land just fine, and are extremely powerful for dominating your opponent. However one drawback is that you cannot renew a mez until the old one has faded. The renewing mez will appear to land, but it will not extend the duration. I proved this by casting Dazzle on a guildmate and starting a 96 second timer. With 10 seconds left in the mez duration I renewed Dazzle, and the effect broke at exactly the 96 second mark. The Dazzle icon was still displayed, but no longer affected him. Trying to cast Mesmerize over the Dazzle icon (that wasn't holding him) bounced, too. The best way to deal with mez renewal is to break the mez with a nuke then renew it. Fear can be used to occupy them till remezzed, as can Whirl Till You Hirl, with some added notes below. Note that mezzed pets still allow you to renew mez as normal.<br>
<br>
Debuffs<br>
Dropping the Weaken, Disempower, and Shallow Breath lines on the target (STR debuff, STR AGI AC debuff, and DD/DOT/STR AGI debuff) will greatly encumber your opponent, and likely cause them to be unable to move because of 1 STR and 1 AGI. SoW or JBoots will allow them to move very very slowly, while Fearing them has an undesired effect (see Fear).<br>
<br>
AE Stuns<br>
If you are grouped with your opponent, AE Stuns have no effect on them. If you have an animation summoned, it will &quot;poof&quot; if your AE Stun hits it.<br>
<br>
Charming<br>
If you charm your opponent they will be yours to control normally. Don't make them sit down, as they do really unpredictable things then. Charming someone who is mezzed will instantly break the mez. Do not use /pet get lost. This will cause charm to break and they will rush you as an NPC until the duration of charm actually breaks. (Really messed up.) If you attempt to charm a pet, you will be informed that you are unable to charm it, however, what really happens is the pet goes berzerk and will become an NPC. Even if you die, the pet will next attack it's owner. (Note: I haven't checked this in the last week, I will today. However, a month ago, this was true.)<br>
<br>
Fearing<br>
Fear is a beautiful spell, and was my desired route for keeping casters busy when I wanted to renew mez. (Mez, Fear, Nuke, Mez, etc...) However, Fear breaks mez instantly when it lands! ALSO, even with 1 STR and 1 AGI, my guildmate ran at full SoW speed when I feared him. Now if you're the zone &quot;The Arena&quot; this isn't a big deal--the fear pathing runs them to the center of the stage and they stay there. Anywhere else, and pray you get mez off before they get out of range. If Rooted, it will take precedence over fear.<br>
<br>
Whirl Till You Hirl<br>
This does NOT break mez when it lands, but is very resisted, and has never held through a nuke for me. What this means is you're better off to just nuke them from Mez.<br>
<br>
Blinding<br>
Against tanks, this is the formula for killing them. Mez, Blind, Nuke, Mez, Blind, Nuke... etc etc. Use the longest mez you have because you'll need all the mana you can get. This works okay against casters not used to Alt-Key casting, or that don't have spells hotkeyed. There's also some discrepency about when they can cast. Honestly Eye of Confusion is my favorite dueling tool still.<br>
<br>
Rooting<br>
Casts faster than Mezzing, can be useful on tanks then manage to rush you, but go for the mez quickly.<br>
<br>
Mana Sieving<br>
Don't bother. The mana you have to expend to drain them would kill them three times over if you just nuke them. Besides, with Mez being impossible to renew without breaking, this is a real pain in the ass. It's fun to do, but not worth it. If you have time to mem Theft of Thought or Wandering mind (and the spell room) go ahead, but Mana Sieve isn't worth the effort.<br>
<br>
Dispelling and DOTs<br>
This is a good idea, but I can just never find the time to cast it. You're likely going to break mez in the process, but sometimes it's worth it, especially wiht a necro, where you aren't going to keep them mezzed (DOT themselves with hp to mana DOT). However, Necros can use a fire based DOT you can't dispel too. Best with them is usually to either chain stun and nuke, or to chain level 4 Mesmerize (consider it a targetted stun) and nuke. Mez will typically hold them long enough for the nuke to finish (since DOT breaks on a 6 second cycle). If you get DOTed keep moving to reduce the damage.<br>
<br>
Gravity Flux<br>
I debuffed myself to 1STR 1AGI and GFluxxed. I took 181 damage on landing. Very embarrassing. However two or three GFluxes at once DO stack, and might elevate you to the 10K damage height.<br>
<br>
Fights for me so far (after my learning period):<br>
<br>
Paladin - Tashania right away, stun bounced off me. Dazzle hit home and med. Drop Incapacitate and Weakness to snare him, Eyes of Chaos, Fear, Discordant Mind. ReDazzle. Hit him with Theft of Thought and went to medding. Right before break, Eyes of Chaos, Fear, Discordant Mind. Paladin never even got LoH off. Result: Ownage.<br>
<br>
Magician - Tashania flew at fight start, followed by Dazzle on Mage. Color Shift hit air pet, and Dazzle it. Then Theft of Thought the mage and decide how to make the kill. Eyes of Chaos followed by Fear breaks mez and runs him to ring center, Discordant Mind. Fear breaks before I land Dazzle, and Dazzle resists, leaving me a nice fat Scars of Sigil to chew on. 2nd Dazzle lands. Continue Blind, Fear, Nuke, Mez till I win, with another ToT before the fight ended. Result - Scary. Mage kills FAST.<br>
<br>
Cleric:<br>
Tashania followed by level 4 Mez. Pillage Enchantment, then level 4 Mez. Pillage Enchantment (killing off HP buffs), then Theft of Thought. Incapacitate and Weakness to snare, then Eyes of Chaos, Fear, Discordant Mind. Result: Ownage.<br>
<br>
Necromancer:<br>
Tashania necro then charge the necro for stun. Color Shift lands on necro and I go for Color Skew. When it lands I Pillage Enchantment on necro and Dazzle. Pet free and a quick stun-mez controls it. Necro is locked up and trot around to half the DOT on me. Theft the necro for mana and proceed to Blind, Fear, Nuke. Dazzle hits home. When the necro is almost dead I charm him, root his pet and attack it. He dies. Pet berzerks and I level 4 mez it, causing it to poof? Freaky. Result: Scary (DOT really ripped me up) but funny as hell... his pet owned him.<br>
<br>
I had quite a few other fights, but they were all pretty much the same. I wanted to try a few with the animation, but not being able to AE stun makes that pointless.<br>
<br>
That's my guide to dueling in The Arena folks.<br>
<br>
P.S. Think I should add something after reviewing. The first fight with the mage, mez bounced and scars of sigil ripped me up while I tried to deal with the air pet and mage at the same time.<br>
<br>
There was a wizard duel where he got an Ice Comet off (bad spell choice on his part) that damn near killed me, but I got control again and he was paste.<br>
<br>
Lastly, the fear is only used there in the arena. Usually... it's just blind nuke and pray for a quick mez. Moving around is cool, but a smart caster just uses hotkeys to cast on you, blind or not. But they won't know WHEN the nuke lands exactly. There was one fight against a druid where I didn't bother fearing. I just blinded and nuked, then remezzed.<br>

Let's assume that NO magic based spell is going to stick, what other options does that leave us?<br>

It's all about Tolapumj robe, buffing up with feedback, illusion-fire elemental (or maybe were wolf), berserker strength and going to town.  The problem with the rapture/sieve strategy is that you're going to be out of mana by casting all those raptures and sieves by the time you suck all the other guy's mana.  Even if you do get a mana-advantage on someone, so what?  What are you going to do with it?<br>
<br>
I think that the person who is going to win the enchanter BOTB is going to be one of the few guys that managed to get a rod of annihilation before they stopped dropping.<br>

I would do some enchanter duels to test this theory out but it seems like it would be WAY too boring.<br>

<br>
In the upper levels, anyone who raids a lot can get their MR pretty high.. most melee types can get to 100+ unbuffed MR, and many can get MUCH higher.<br>
<br>
Many high level caster types can get to 150 ish self buffed, or even higher if they are raid types and have a set of MR gear.  Since MR is something that you tend to use for most uber type mobs, anyone who raids even occasionally has this gear.<br>
<br>
In my personal resist gear (which is basically a set of blue diamond stuff with diamond velium rings), my UNBUFFED resists are all above 100.  My DR and PR are right around 100-105 unbuffed, and the rest are about 110 ish.<br>
<br>
Self buffed in my resist gear, all my saves are about 100 except for MR, which is around 200 ish. Once a pc gets to about 100 in a resist, its almost impossible for another pc to land a spell on him, unless you are a necro casting lifetap, or a wizard casting lure.  <br>
<br>
I would think one of the best ways we have of doing damage in a duel would be our hasted pet.. those things attack FAST, and will interrupt most casters.<br>
<br>
I dont duel much tho, so i dont know...<br>

Nothing is gonna work. If you cast a pet, it's just gonna get mez'd. I guess you could dispel your own pet. Basically the only thing you can do is cast a pet, dispel the mez on him, and mana sieve down your opponent. Hopefully, your pet will be better than his and you'll win.<br>
<br>
Maybe you could fear the enemy's pet and mem blur your own to get it to switch targets to the enemy enchanter. A little bit tricky, but I doubt that would take you all the way to the top. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ullorianlanys.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Llorian Lanys</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>p0\/\/3r-p0sT3r!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(4/2/01 2:07:21 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Goshan's Topic of the day - Dueling</span><hr size=1> There is no way in hell any spell is sticking to another enchanter in a BotB scenerio, other than unresistable ones.<br>
<br>
Unlike some of the other classes that can attack in different ways ( shaman can cast poison, disease, cold, and magic based spells, necros can do the same, etc ), enchanters are ALL about MR, which is one of the easiest resists to raise.. ESPECIALLY for an enchanter.<br>
<br>
Doing CR naked, i have 104 MR with my buffs... i know cause i spent quite a bit of time naked doing cr a couple days ago <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
<br>
I would think any mid 50s enchanter would be able to get to 150 easy in POOR gear, with just a couple diamond rings and such... In decent gear, way over 200 (goshan said he can get 250, and i know i personally can get slightly over 200 self buffed mr)<br>
<br>
I think the persons strategies are sound for your typical fight, if no one has time to grab their resist kit.  If you ARE gonna duel as an enchanter, you need to duel that person right then, dont give them time to switch gear.<br>
<br>
Otherwise, you need to use nasty tricks to win, such as charming nearby mobs.<br>
<br>
Failing that, you could probably kill a monk / ranger, and mabye even a warrior with some combination of Feedback, Illusion Fire elemental, berzerk spirit, and your pet.<br>

Anyways, that guide is good probably for anyone sub-50 (who is not a supatwink), because at those levels peeps don't have the uber MR that they do post-50.  Before 50 or so I could own just about any class in a duel, except bard with their damn MR song.  Now I get owned by just about anyone because anyone who will even accept a duel with me usually has their MR gear in their pack and quickly gets 150+ MR which means no spells landing for me. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :/ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":/"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I'd love to see a guide that would be useful to me, which assumes most peeps have MR of 150+.<br>
<br>
A hasted pet is probably the way to go against a melee target, but it doesn't do you much good against a caster, since they'll just root your pet and proceed to nuke/dot you into oblivion.  I liked that charming the necro and rooting his pet thing, didn't think of that. :P  And I knew there were bugs associated with chanters and dueling, but damn, not that many.

<br>
Anyone with 100 MR after tash is basically immune to us, in a one on one setting, and even necros and mages ( in the upper levels ) have 100 MR or so easy... (with their resist stuff on)<br>

They said they won't make clerics duel eachother cuz that would be retarded. I bet Chanter botb is the same thing. We might have some kind of mob mezzing contest or something that actually portrays our everyday jobs quite accurately. But I kind of hope we duel =) I think I have a decent strategy. Will have to test it tho. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ullorianlanys.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Llorian Lanys</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Cyber Pimp</span><br> <font color=#000033>(5/20/01 11:09:08 am)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Goshan's Topic of the day - Dueling</span><hr size=1> bump. <p><a href="http://www.mithrilweb.com//"target="web"><img src="http://www.mithrilweb.com/images/sigs/llosig.jpg" border="0">
