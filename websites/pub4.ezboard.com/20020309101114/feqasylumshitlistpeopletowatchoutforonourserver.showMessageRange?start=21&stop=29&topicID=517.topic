I'll just tell you my story.  I was camping Oowamp, and this necro dude with pet comes along and sits down right in front of me, like I'm not even there.  I was on the phone with Alexias at this point and I told her, I have a baaad feeling about this guy...he looks like he's going to try to take camp from me.  (I was like 44 at this time, he was in his 50's) well he's buffing his pet up in front of me, then goes LD...I'm like &quot;Wheeew&quot;...then about 30 mins later, he reappears, runs around for a second (20 seconds tops) then walks right up to me, I mean almost on top of me, and sits again (no I'm not invisible either, heh) summons a new pet...about 45 seconds later or so, he goes LD again.  Then about an hour later or so, he's back...same stuff again...waits, waits, never says anything to me..just stands right there...then finally asked me if I'd gotten a sheer bone mask off of Oowamp yet.  I said nope, but if I do, I'll go ahead and give it to you (I was there more for exp than anything).  Then he said he'd be fighting Spirocs, and he left.  Later on I did get a sheer bone mask, went to send him a tell, and he was gone.  About a week later I saw him in Commons, and I'd kept that mask for him, but after asking three times if he's meet me at bank and I'll give it to him, I gave up because he never replied.  I still have that mask, I'd been saving it for him, but at this point, it's going to a newbie.  I can't say he did anything &quot;wrong&quot; in all of this, but I have to be honest, I had a sincere feeling he was checking to see if he could take camp from me, or waiting for first screw up so he could take advantage of it.  Again, I in no way am shitlisting him, because although I think it was kinda tired the way he was acting near me, he did nothing wrong, but reading this thread pretty much confirms to me that if he'd have detected in any way I'd have had trouble with that camp, he'd have taken it from me in a heartbeat..<br>

He asked me to transfer crap for him real quick and being the usual me I said ok... Well he handed me two plat +int rings and 7 rations of food. He said he was logging on his other character which name escapes me but he was a gnome in Rune of Flame with Smoked in his name. Can't remember, whitesmoked or something. Anyways, had to wait 30 freakin minutes for this &quot;quick xfer&quot; and when he finally got there he tried to tell me that he had given me a gbs and bonecaster robe etc etc. Then told me how hes petitioning me and stuff. I figured he was on crack and told him good luck and logged. He sounds like a major con artist. <p><P><p align="center"><a href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/players/view_profile.asp?Id=9331" target="_blank"><img src="http://conquest.inet.net.nz/images/elidrinsignature.jpg" border="0"><P>

He was a real moron ...the Chrismaticle.. only meet Christimatic once, he was just kinda...stupid.  Anyway Christmaticle first kept getting into trouble in oasis (I was there sitting down doing nothing waiting on a Hate raid) and about every few minutes I'd hear &quot;Christmaticle yells for help off to the left of you&quot;  And here comes a train of like 8 orcs.  After the first 3 trains I quit helping cuz he was trying to get buffed from clerics and such there as much as I could figure.  Anyway later on I was at Sro at the portal waiting to go to Hate and here he comes again, trains 3 or 4 madmen and a zombie to the portal screaming for help, clerics and enchanters buff him and he runs off.  Comes back 5 minutes later same big ass train.  I'm pretty sure this is one of his twinks, but I'm not positive, the M.O. is the same, they're both idiots.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><img SRC="http://user.netomia.com/dammned1/sig2.jpg"></br>
