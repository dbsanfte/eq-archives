The tone of your posts seems to indicate that you have a problem with that.  TCC had Fear sceduled and we cleared the zone.  Some had to leave, and many were under level 55 and didn't stay for the attempt.  So, Visions came to help take down CT.  I'm sorry thier success spoiled things for you, but you always need to keep timing in mind with mobs like CT.<br>
<br>
Please remember that if a raid already in the zone feels that they can alone or with help attempt CT, they will do so.  It had nothing to do with being &quot;uber&quot;, nor is it about the &quot;Phat loot.&quot;  If the god pops before your sceduled raid (spawn cycle is + or minus hours or days depending upon the spawn time--thus plus or minus a few days I believe for CT), please do not be surprised if it is taken out earlier than your scheduled raid.  It's possible that a raid sceduled by calendar (as was TCC's) will take him out.  It's possible that others will take him out after Fear is cleared after a sceduled raid.  There is nothing wrong with that.  <br>
<br>
You can let every guild on the server know of your intensions, but you will find that people will still attempt him if he's up and they feel they can.  Your having him scheduled a few days from then will not impact that.  It's always been the luck of the draw with his spawn.  He's harder now so fewer attempt him.  That means that you have a decent chance of his being up, but you cannot count on it.    Heck, look at the reservations for Trak and you will get the idea.<br>
<br>
Most ranted about CQ taking out CT regardless of the scheduled raid's intensions/desires. Now, you think it's wrong for TCC, who had the plane sceduled and cleared, to call in reinforcements to take down CT?  /boggle  You can't have it both ways.  <br>
<br>
<br>
Now all that having been said:<br>
<br>
If he's up for the day you scedule and you aren't stepping on the Fear raid's toes for that day, I wish you luck with him.  I was unable to stay for the attempt last night, but I know many were looking forward to it.<br>

We all have our point of views and opinions, and in this matter mine and many other varies, but that doesnt make us right or wrong.  I decided not to say a thing on the boards, and just try and do it next pop. Just to give you a one little tid bit that might let you in on why i am a bit crushed by this is that CT had been up i think since the day i have came back to this game. I guess CQ killed him&lt;after his new none-dot etc thing&gt; but other then that no one had got him under 50%. I had a fear raid posted and planned thursday as my kinda coming back raid. Alot of old friends where coming, and seeing that CT had been up for so long i wanted to take a shot at him. I was up for 27hrs straight with no sleep researching him and recruiting people for this, i had close to 70-80 coming post 55s and alot of 60s. Alot of people loved the idea of a open server actually getting a chance at CT. Would say alot for our server to say we pulled togher and took out CT open server, which every one knows is harder to do then with a well trained, and uber guild. Anyway, having not slept for 27hrs and planing on staying up until i passed out to make sure that i had enough people to KILL CT hands down, and getting told that CT was killed, after i had made it quite clear that this event was going on, and even had a few CC people coming. I know you wont see it from my perspective and im sure you think i would be talking diffrent if i had been in one of those guilds that took him out, but i assure you i wouldnt. There is no point in debating this issue, people have there feelings about it, some for each. I am disapointed, yes, but i will live and i defintaly learned alot, not all good but i guess oh well. Plz do not post on here starting a flame war or anything, you guys got CT, good for you, am i glad you took him, no but i guess in alot of peeps eyes you had every right to and i cant blame you for that. I can hold my own opinions of what you did, but i will not flame or bash a guild for it. Issue, closed and i apoloize to all those that took work off or cancled plans so close to this date and now cant do it. I will try to make it up to you friends, and next time it will be the day he spawns so he will be ours. I just hope all you that were coming, will trust me again and give me another chance, i wont let you down, i promise.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumfrm25.showMessage?topicID=1076.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumfrm25.showMessage?topicID=1082.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumfrm25.emailToFriend?topicID=1121.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumfrm25.threadControl?topicID=1121.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumfrm25.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1121.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumfrm25.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1121.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub4.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="eqasylumgeneral">General<option value="eqasylumfrm25">Raid Discussions<option value="eqasylumthetavernincharacterdiscussion">The Tavern <option value="eqasylumthemerchantsunionbuyselltradeorannounceyourservicesforhire">The Merchant's Union<option value="eqasylumbiographiessharesomeinfoaboutyourself">Biographies <option value="eqasylumplayerrunquestsorganizeandfindactorsfordynamicquests">Player Run Quests <option value="eqasylumlookingforgroupannounceplanorjoinraidsandgroups">Looking for group!!!! <option value="eqasylumthehallofhonour">The Hall of Honour<option value="eqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver">The Shit List <option value="eqasylumfrm24">Community Polls<option value="eqasylumrantsandravesbalancingissues">Rants and Raves <option value="eqasylumfrm30">Gone for good... maybe<option value="eqasylumfrm26">Guildleaders' Forum<option value="eqasylumfrm28">Admin Use Only<option value="eqasylumbard">Bard<option value="eqasylumcleric">Cleric<option value="eqasylumdruid">Druid<option value="eqasylumenchanter">Enchanter<option value="eqasylummagician">Magician<option value="eqasylummonk">Monk<option value="eqasylumnecromancer">Necromancer<option value="eqasylumpaladin">Paladin<option value="eqasylumranger">Ranger<option value="eqasylumrogue">Rogue<option value="eqasylumshadowknight">Shadowknight<option value="eqasylumshaman">Shaman<option value="eqasylumwarrior">Warrior<option value="eqasylumwizard">Wizard</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#000033>- </font><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/beqasylum>Lanys Community Forum</a><font color=#000033> - </font><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumfrm25>Raid Discussions</a> <font color=#000033> - </font><a href="http://www.lanys.com">Lanys.com</a><font color=#000033> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://www.qksrv.net/click-553273-677484" target="_blank" >
