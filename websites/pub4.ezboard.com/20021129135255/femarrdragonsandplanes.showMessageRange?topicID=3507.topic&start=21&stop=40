I run a small guild to start with.  We were founded early in the year.  It takes time and effort to build up, create a structure, to recruit like mad for hours without the slightest move in your exp bar, to log your alts to help the younger members catch up to the senior members... etc.  If all the so-called &quot;dedicated&quot; members (exMembers) who claimed such loyalty at the time actually STAYED, we'd have a nice sized guild by now with people online on a regular basis.  But no, people don't want to wait, stick it out, work to build a better guild.  They want the quick fix.  I can think of more than one such deserter and it really ticks me off.  One even joined us, learned where all the fastest leveling zones were from our senior officers and went from aprox 34ish to 50 in a very short period of time.  As soon as he reached 50 he deguilded with barely a good bye.   I am sick of players who act like this.  Oh but he says he wants to be friends still.  No hard feelings for USING us and then leaving. We may not be a power guild, we never were, and those who join us KNOW this from the very beginning.  I think of one such exMember who knew this better than anyone, acted like he supported us all the way and then left to go uber WITHOUT saying goodbye on the board, talking to any officer, particularly me, yet he still wants to &quot;hang out with us&quot; be my buddy and oh yeah, I can have one of alts, maybe, if he got off his ass to actually apply the character. BAH   I am about ready to black ball the next person who blows this kind of smoke up my a$$.  Almost every single exMember has given some lame line about how they hope there is no hard feelings <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> (after they have deguilded in the middle of  night when noone is looking and some officer sees them the next day to ask WTF)</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> and that they will stay in touch <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> (yeah right)</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> and maybe if they have nothing better to do, that they might think of us if they are bored.  GRRRRRRRR  I’m about ready to go evil and turn in my priest of discord book!  …But I wont because I do actually have some REAL dedicated people that would hate to see Mirwen turn evil and go rampage.  Ah the cost of lawful goodness.<br>
<br>
If you're not going to stick it out, work together to build the guild, take RESPOSIBILTY for your own part of belonging to a guild, then you do not belong in ANY decent guild, whether it is an Uber Guild, Casual guild, or RP Guild.  Plain and simple.  No matter what guild you join, you MUST put in some time and effort into being a productive member.  And oh my goodness, yes you must actually work a little.  God forbid you actually work.<br>
<br>
Yep it’s a rant forum… just had to vent. The sting of a recent stab in the back is still fresh on my mind.<br>

I never left after getting a piece of loot then bolting though, that's pretty shitty.  My first guild was an RP guild, leader stepped over me one time to further his own plot and I left.  My second guild was merely a friendly invite from someone that wanted me to join even though I had put in an application somewhere else and I made them fully aware of my intentions before I accepted an invite.<br>
<br>
My third guild, Affliction, I've been with for the past two years.  We've weathered many a storm together, some jump ship in bad times, others leave to other issues and not during bad times.  Sometimes people just want to &quot;see the world&quot; and get things done and sometimes they just want to be with closer friends who happen to be in higher level guilds.<br>
<br>
But there is one thing I'd add to &quot;don't take the loot and run&quot; and I've not seen it directly mentioned but its early I could've missed it.  The one thing I don't like that I've seen happen is when people stealth apply for another guild when they are in a guild and have every intention of leaving it, if and only if their application goes through.  <br>
<br>
Dracon mentions only taking unguilded people, it'd be a nice way to do it if everyone liked doing it that way, but I'm not gonna claim anyone does and therefore we'll always have people bitching about Soandso leaving for loot, or Soandso leaving after getting phat_lewt00.<br>

<br>
When you get the 4 people on Gremers list to come here and post that they were not in a guild when they &quot;applied&quot; then I will believe you.<br>
<br>
Now I know some were not aplications but were more along the lines of Recruitment, but...thats a pretty technical point.<br>
<br>
Do you realy think that people who change guilds never talk to thier old guildmates/friends? or maybe thier RL relatives who are still in the old guild/other guilds?<br>
 <br>
Not trying to flame anyone here, people can change guilds for whatever reason they like and as far as im concerned more power to them. They are grown ups (for the most part) and can make thier own decissions.<br>
<br>
Lets just say Dracon stated guild policy and you guys try to uphold it to the best of your abilty and leave it at that.<br>

<br>
You (I think) are saying an applicant is someone &quot;trialing&quot; with you and is considered an &quot;applicant&quot; for the entire Trial process during which time they are not allowed to be in a guild (for however long the trial period lasts)<br>
<br>
We on the other hand look at an Applicant as someone Inquireing about becoming a &quot;Trial&quot; and while they are &quot;trialing&quot; with us are considered (sorta junior) members of the guild with limited rights. we dont call them Applicants and they are &quot;trial&quot; members of the guild.<br>
<br>
For you, Applicant = someone in the Trial period<br>
For us Appicant = someone Inquireing about getting a trail period.<br>
<br>
I *hope* that clears things up. if I'm not right flame away, havnt gotten involved in a good one for a long time <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

4.  member stage = someone who has passed a 30day sponsership and received 75%+ Yes votes with zero No votes during that time.<br>
<br>
Person must be guildless before they can send in an application to start stage #1.  Like I mentioned before, you gotta burn all your bridges before you even know if you can attend a single raid.  Most people who like to guildjump to get loot don't have the balls to make that sort of blind leap.<br>

Right now for example I refuse to participate in ANY guild action that includes<br>
ONE player. Just One.<br>
<br>
Dont ask me who or why. It is a guild matter.<br>
<br>
What does matter is certain people try and 'weed out' people they dont like.<br>
That is resented by people who feel they are just as good as the other person.<br>
After a while it gets old. After a while they say to hell with it. The guild leader is<br>
supposed to be on top of it. Not everyone is as stubborn as I am. <p>“It is clear that the individual who persecutes a man, his brother, because he is not of the same opinion, is a monster.”

Magister is an entirely different guild. <br>
<br>
<br>
Contrary to what your &quot;informed sources&quot; tell you the remaining 2 were unguilded applicants. If they had been turned down id wager they would have either quit the game or applied somewhere else. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> For you, Applicant = someone in the Trial period<br>
For us Appicant = someone Inquireing about getting a trail period.<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
For us, Applicant is someone who emails an app and we discuss whether we want them on raids. They become invites if they pass that stage and in due time can become sponsors or get the boot. We make it difficult to become a member becuase  many apps get the &quot;OMG i just killed everything, i win Luclin!&quot; complex then quit the game after a few weeks of raiding with us.  sometimes you can spot that a mile away and other times its harder. <br>
<br>
So apps come and go and occasionally the serious gamer comes along and shows he intends to be around for more than a few clearings. those are the people we want. The ones who actually care about helping the guild and themselves advance. <br>
<br>
There are some decent powergamers on this server who are trapped in lower tier guilds mainly out of obligation , they want to be the best and kick that ass everyday but dont want to leave their small guild becuase they dont want to be branded a loot whore or a traitor. So they log in everyday, power up their char, do nothing but exp in 2 year old dungeons work on AA points they wil never get full use of and eventually quit when they get fed up of it all. <br>
<br>
In answer to the topics question.  yeah some people use their middle tier guild as a stepping stone to a higher tier guild. On the other hand i see higher tier guilds use lower tier players as stepping stones for higher tier loot for their core members. .<br>
<br>
Look at some of the guild sites in the general forum and check out some of the rosters.  youll see a guild with x number of class and  really only one has any good gear.  The rest have very low tier loot and tend to quit sooner  than later becuase the loot hog of that class is taking everything for himself and the  little guy says *f this* quits and gets replaced by another little guy who gets the same treatment.  <br>
<br>
Its an endless circle and many people blindly play like it doesnt exist. i think thats much worse than when a player quits the guild after getting  an &quot;epic&quot; (omg you left after we gave you a 2 year old piece of loot. i hate you!).<br>

Magister, but I know that Ice had a policy of one no vote meant no.<br>
So the bigger the guild the more likely a 'no'<br>
<br>
It is just possible Chuk, that there are good players, that feel all that is BS.<br>
It could be that they feel that they are good, and they dont need Magister<br>
telling them that. And if that means, a 'lesser' guild, then they are willing to take that, rather than deal with arrogance. It is possible.<br>

However if you wish to abase yourself before us Chit then feel free.  Somehow though I don't think you'd get past stage 1.<br>
<br>
We are always looking for serious players since we have a hardcore style of gaming.  We strive to conquer new territory first and that takes people who can play lots and work towards the goal of succeeding.<br>
<br>
The format of our application process though is almost as much a deterint against those serious gamers unless those people are truely unhappy in their current guild and will risk it all to get in.  That means deguilding and burning those bridges.<br>
<br>
We could definately use more serious gamers but will always stick with a drawn out invite process so we can weed out those whom might not be right for our style of play.  Or we might not be right for them. It works both ways Chit and someone who is serious will put forth the effort.  Most of those who like to &quot;abase themselves before us&quot; tend not to be the right type of player for us anyways. However, if someone wants to be in the forefront of the game, we'd be the place to look into.  Thankfully we've had a couple good cross-server applicatants who've turned out nicely. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
All I can say is, well your &quot;background checks&quot; leave a little to be desired. They may have told you they we not members of a guild and maybe they had guild removed themselves so a /guildstatus would show them guildless, but I can assure you they hadn't informed any officer or other member of thier old guild that they had left. they ould have instantly been re-guilded if nothing was said, we would have just assumed they had lost thier guild tag in a zone bug or had joined a raid (pre-raid chanel of course).<br>
<br>
Like I said I dont mean to flame any of the people who have joined you or are considering joining and that wanst my intent, it was just the blanket statment of &quot;we only take unguilded people&quot; caught my, and a lot of other peoples eye.<br>
