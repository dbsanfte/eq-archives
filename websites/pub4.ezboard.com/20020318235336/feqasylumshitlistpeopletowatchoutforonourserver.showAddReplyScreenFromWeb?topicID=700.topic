<br>
The rest of the post is to make others aware of this.<br>
<br>
Begins with inuro   auctioning a SBS for cheap... Being that I had been looking for one, I jumped all over it. Drained the account and headed to meet at T3. <br>
<br>
Asked if i could give pp to monk  then get shield. Very hesitant of course   but being a dumb ass nice person I agreed.   &quot;In comes loma&quot;.    PP transfer and i wait. and wait. and wait.<br>
<br>
The whole time this is happening I still am hoping that this persons computer locked up or something.... It happens. But after 20 mins  nothing.<br>
<br>
So I check on lanys.com for guild so i can contact an officer, and nothing  /shrug.<br>
<br>
So I came here.  I really hate posting here because I know that I have no one to blame but myself. But i like to think that that people like this dont exist.<br>
<br>
Mortierre 55 druid<br>
<br>
I would like to appologize to the Guardians of Dawn. After Checking the out dated and lanys board and oocing with  no response, I had assumed it to be the remants of a guild.<br>
<br>
My posting the name was not intended to blame the guild.<br>
It was intended to hopefully allow me to gain more information about the guild to contact the officers. <br>
I have contacted Faltan  and discussed the situation. I have been assured that proper actions will be taken.<br>
<br>
For the individual mentioned before the edit...   I have never at any time just ignored anyone with a question about officers.  Even when i didnt know them. I chekced in guild and if no one answered I at least responded to the individual with a &quot;no one on&quot; or &quot;no response, sorry&quot; or something.  <br>

Doesn't sound like the Guardians of Dawn that I know, though. I've never had problems with that particular guild, and I can't name many who have. Maybe there was some sort of miscommunication?<br>

And the title of your post makes it look like you're including the entire guild (ie: just another name in the list).<br>
<br>
Just because amankudo doesn't know the person who scammed you... it doesn't mean that he was involved in the scam. This person could have been new to the guild. Or he could have been an alt who was inactive for a long time. Amankudo, himself, could have been new enough to the guild, that he just didn't know a lot of people.<br>
<br>
Your argument is not strengthened by the fact that he didn't get back to you with the name of an officer. He could have been very busy with other tells. And it doesn't sound like you tried very hard to get in touch with other people for an officer's name. According to your timeline... 20 minutes passed after you asked amankudo to check for you. Wasn't that enough time for you to do a /who all, and ask someone else?<br>
<br>
If you understand that your case against amankudo is so weak, that you need to put his name in parenthesis with a question mark... then you can understand why his name shouldn't be in the title at all. Leave the details in the body. But take the name out of the title.<br>
<br>
You should also take the name of the guild out of the title, and put it into the body of the post... (with emphasis on the fact that you <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>only</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> include it for the sake of information and identification). Not to be picky or anything. But your post isn't gonna do you much good if it gets locked. <p><b>Klompur</b><BR>

Then i went back to my raiding and about 40 minutes later asked in guildchat why he asked if an officer was on.  Never heard anythign of it so brought it to the attention of the guildmaster that somebody was after an officer today but i missed a name so will have to see what becomes of it.  Anyhow Adjani a dear friend of mine told me somebody was talking ill of the guild in EC and sent him my way.  I am an officer i play most days.  Also for all you people wondering if you have an issue with a guild do /who all '(insert guild name here)  and you will get a list of members of tha guild on that are not online that way you can look for yourself for an officer.  make sure you put the '  so that it does not search player names and searches guild names also if the name is long you can type whole frist word then half of second word.  This issue has not been resolved yet with loma or the poster but i ask that guild name and amankudo be removed as they have nothign to do with the person.  Amanhukudo is a sorta mimature person but he did not do this infact all he did was get annoyed by fact you sent him 20 tells and not reply.  They are not same people i know this for a fact so your beaf is with loma inuro not the guild or amankudo.  Now onto issue of reparation i am gonna look into it and get the sbs from loma and disband her either way loma is disbanded but i do not know about the rest if i do not get sbs then you are out plat plain and simple i can not help you.  The guild has no bank and each person is responsible for own money and as my bank is empty i cna not make reparations for you.  Please talk to amoge in game to get further issue resolved also please remove guild from list and amankudo as they have nothign to do with this.  Now i knew this was an issue the way amankudo aksed in guild about if an officer was on he said some jerk keeps sending me tells and being rather rude asking if an officer is on so is there one on.  Now if i wanted info even if i have been wronged i sure as hell would not be rude to the person i ask.  Either way issue closed.<br>

In regards to the bad trade, the guild will make every effort to return either the plat or the SBS if it can be recovered.<br>
<br>
Loma will be removed from the guild at the first opportunity.  The Guardians of Dawn do not condone, under any circumstances, outright fraud commited against another member of the Lanys community.  We will take whatever measures are appropriate to redress this stain upon our guild's reputation.<br>
<br>
As far as Amankundo is concerned, he is indeed new to the guild.  Please remove his name (and the guild's) from your original post, as the only person who should be named in this entire incident is Loma.<br>

Just for future reference, if you have problems and can't immediately find an officer, please check the guilds section of Lanys.com or the EZBoard ring from the main page.  You will likely find a guild site and be able to post requesting an officer's attention and help.  I know I would be frustrated if someone had an issue with a guild member, and never posted on our web site, sent me an email (address is on the website) or waited more than an hour or two to post on the SL.

Loma is indeed a very new member who was brought onboard for a trial period after attending one of our open events.  Clearly he/she has failed the trial period and will be removed from the guild as soon as I catch up with him/her if another officer has not already done so.<br>
<br>
I will also do my best to see to it that more care is taken in the future before granting people even a trial period.  Loma's actions are the antithesis of everything we as a guild are about.<br>
<br>
If anyone has a problem with one of our members that they need to bring to the attention of an officer I would request that they contact Amoge, Faltan / Harnon, Bandi / Rhenn, Healuright, or myself (Mukhtar / Khazith) in game.  If none of us are available, then please post a message on our guild boards at pub26.ezboard.com/guardiansofdawn and we will address it as soon as we can.<br>

That was about 4k above my asking price, so I said &quot;Yes!&quot;, and went to Shady to trade with him.  Got there, and the anon ogre (we'll call him Bob) wanted to do a third party trade.  He told me he had the money on his main, and wanted the item on his ogre.  I told him that's fine - if he logged on his main, I could take the PP and transfer CSS to his twink, or just give the CSS to his main - with the PP.  He ignored me for about 5 minutes, until I got a tell from his &quot;friend&quot; saying that I needed to do this trade because it's really a test of trust - if I let him have the CSS and switch characters, Bob would &quot;hook me up&quot;.  I said NO, and said something in /say about only giving the CSS when I got the PP.  Guy next to me sent me a tell, and told me he was pulling the same trick on him, trying to get the CSS without paying.  I told Bob no thanks, and to let me know if he could pay when he got the item.  About 5 minutes after this, someone began shouting about Bob scamming him of the CSS.<br>
<br>
Moral of the story?  DON'T DO THIRD PARTY TRADE UNLESS YOU DON'T CARE IF YOU NEVER SEE THE ITEM AGAIN.  Period.  End of story.  If you get scammed in a third party trade, I blame you.  While stealing is wrong, and the other party is at fault also, you should realize that third party trades JUST ARN'T WORTH IT!!<br>

As far as I am aware she does not have any alternate characters remaining in the guild.  However she may continue attempting to conduct this scam.  To help people avoid it her character names that I know of are:<br>
<br>
Loma<br>
Suepra<br>
Suepralis<br>
<br>
For those who trusted her due to our guildtag I offer my sincerest appologies.  While I do not have the platinum to give you a SBS or a refund outright (never seen more than 5k at a time in all 53 of my levels) I would be more than willing to come help you hunt for a SBS in Chardok sometime.  Or assist anywhere else my services could be of use, free of all expectation of loot on my part.  Also consider yourselves invited to any of my future raids that you want in on.<br>

Amoge has a velium bracer in bank and a bunch of bd's i will give you the bracer and the 3 bd's which is a tad over the value of what you lost.  Contact amoge in game and it shall be done.  And amukado had asked in guild if an officer was on and i had said i was on but as i was mid raid i ignored it and went on.  I am sorry for not getting to you sooner as if i had the second sham would of been avoided and i am sorry for that.<br>
Reparations has also been made to the second person he shammed hopefully this is done and over to the second person we as a guild owe another 3.5k as amoge onloy had 3.5 k in hard cash so llangowen needs to contact me in game so we can figure out how to do this.<br>

And I personally thank all those that stepped up and defended our guild.  As to what i was saying up top ingame if you wanna know who is online in a certain guild you type /who all 'guardians of dawn   that is if you wanted my guild if you wanted the menacing horde you would type /who all 'the menacing horde    make sure you put the '  in so that it looks at guild tags not character names.  This would of helped mortierre to contact me at the time or find someone else that would talk to her in the guild.  <br>

<br>
However I want to say that I want the name of the second person who took Amoge's money for the SBS.  I argued with Amoge for a good 30 minutes about giving this guy his own money (every pp of it) to make &quot;reparations&quot; for the guy's own stupidity.  GoD is a wonderful guild, and generous to a fault.  They made a mistake openly recruiting at an event they had, but they have realized their mistake and removed the &quot;bad seed.&quot;<br>
<br>
They are NOT IN ANY WAY responsible for the stupidity of the people who were scammed by loma.  They have done everything they needed to do by removing this person from the guild, warning the community about her, and being sure that (so amoge tells me) in the future they do not allow someone in without screening first.  I cannot remember how many freaking times the MOTD has said do not engage in third party trades, and how many scams have been shouted in EC, posted on the shitlist, etc.  If someone STILL engages in third party trades, I have no sympathy for them whatsoever if they get scammed, and certainly don't think that anyone owes them anything.  If either of the people scammed accept money or items from Amoge for their own stupidity, they belong on my personal shitlist for greed and not taking responsibility for their own mistakes.<br>
<br>
Please tell us the name of the person who accepted your money Amoge, or if it was already posted somewhere in the thread someone point it out to me. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <br><font color=#000033>- </font><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/beqasylum>Lanys Community Forum</a><font color=#000033> - </font><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver>The Shit List </a> <font color=#000033> - </font><a href="http://www.lanys.com">Lanys.com</a><font color=#000033> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.6.4<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
