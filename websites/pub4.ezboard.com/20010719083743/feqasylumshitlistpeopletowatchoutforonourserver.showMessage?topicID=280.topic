Our lower level group went to the second floor to camp the Hilt.  Me, and 3 other level 40+ guildies were going down to the 3rd floor to try and get the shards.  Well, keep in mind that for most of us, Dalnirs is a new experience.  I had only been in there a few time and never past the first level.  Only one of our members had been further then the first floor.  So anyway, we get to the stairs with the pit trap, cast levitate on all of us and proceed to drop through the floor.  We fully expected to get attacked.  On my way down, I see a Kly Follower below us.  Not being attacked, just standing there.  As soon as we get in aggro range, the Kly starts beating on our Mage.  I follow with a stun and the Necro DoTs.  We kill the Kly, I get Exp.  Woot!  Here is where Uzziell comes in.<br>
<br>
He starts /OOC'ing to the entire zone that we are a bunch of KS'ers and that he has been on the third floor for hours and that he had ALL the camps except for the overseer.  He is what?  a level 58 Wizard?  Farming for Robes.  You know he is not getting any experience.  Anyway, we try to talk to him to let him know we are only after the dagger pieces.  At one point in time, we even offered to let him have those crappy robes that drop down there.  What does he do?  Put us on /ignore and starts another attack in /ooc.  He even had the audacity to /petition to a GM that we were KS'ing.  However, it was funny that the GM sided with us and MADE Uzziel share the spawn.  All we wanted was the Church room and up until the GM got there, he was still trying to take the kills from us.  He would invis and run to the alter and wait.  We got smart after the first time and cast see invis on everyone.<br>
<br>
The only reason I am posting this here is because he would not even try to talk to us in the game except to be abusive.  We tried to work it out in game, but he just ignored us.  Oh, well.  After the stuff I read in the other post, I am not surprised. <p><TABLE BORDER=0>

Some people wonder why they have a bad rep and yet continue in their foul ways.  Since Uzziell left our guild (Dark Whispers), I had hoped he would find some way to make friends on EQ.  It must be lonely to have no-one like you and have to resort to farming green mobs because you can't get a group.<br>
I really think its funny that the GM had to come and I am repulsed by his KSsin ways.  He can be a really nice guy when he wants to, alas that doesn't seem to be his intention.  You were3 correct in posting this here so that others can see he hasn't changed or even tried to change. <p><center><img src="http://home.kc.rr.com/istrahd/milo.jpg" border=0 alt="I am

<br>
Frankly, the definition of killstealing involves a group or an individual attacking and getting the kill for a mob that had first been attacked by another.  Doesn't sound like Kill stealing took place here.  &quot;Claim jumping&quot; perhaps (not saying it's a valid claim mind you <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ), but NOT Kill Stealing. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/beqasylum.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=grudgebringer>Grudgebringer</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Certified <B>Jackass</B></span><br> <font color=#000033>(10/27/00 8:38:18 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Uzziell Revisted in Dalnirs</span><hr size=1> But there are people like Uzziell out there!  /grin<br>

The fact is, this guy was there to camp (farm) two Robes and was unwilling to compromise.  After all of the stuff that he has done in the past, why <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  anyone</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, besides people similar in behavior, would give this guy the time of day is beyond me.  I read the whole log of exactly what was said between Uzziell, Aaeleaa, Zambone, Mandidar, and Mrie (I have all of the screenshots).  This guy is what really ruins Everquest for so many people.  He tries to camp an area (AREA!) and the minute someone shows up (however honest their intentions are) he spews insults, threats, and more.  Suffice it to say, this guy is a jerk and will NEVER change.  Here are a few shots on what went on (I have PLENTY more, believe me)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.geocities.com/neesha_necro/camp.JPG"><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>
<br>
It's always nice to be informed that someone intends on camping an entire section of a zone.  Compromise?  I guess not...<br>

For the record, doing a /guildstatus shows that he is STILL in Dark Whispers (I am not in any way blaming that guild for this).<br>

What good does this person really contribute to EQ?
