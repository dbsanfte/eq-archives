I really don't understand why people who don't agree can't just move on and find someplace where they can be happy, but, then, I guess that's life in EQ.<br>
<br>
When a guild with a council of leaders has 5 leaders who can work as a team and one member who proves time and time again that he can't, it's time to move on.  None of us has claimed that the person who left left of their own will.  I only discuss this now that they've broken their silence by posting and emailing flames all over the place, whereas we had commited to doing this quietly and privately so that the person leaving could do so with dignity.  Kikaki, a council member, was voted out by the unanimous vote of all other present council members, per the rules he helped create.  This was due to the strong feelings of the rest of the team that due to a number of incidents he was not a team player nor was he onboard with the direction we'd like to take the guild.  He was given a day or two to resign gracefully and step down without losing face, rather than being removed straight away.  We handled it this way because it was the kindest way we could think of to do so, but we won't make that mistake again if this is where it leads anyways.<br>
<br>
Kikaki had in the past done a lot for the guild, and that was always appreciated.  He is a strong competent leader, who would probably do wonderful in a guild in which he was the only leader.  In a council of equals, it just didn't work.  Again, we had hoped to do this as nicely for him as possible, but he has obviously chosen to take it public in a nasty way.  Yes, in our PRIVATE oficer forums, we certainly had told him why we felt why we did and had asked him to leave before we made him leave.  I can only presume that these private communications are what the others in this thread are going on about being 'the nasty truth.'  We indeed had some harsh things to say to him in that private setting, because he deserved to know explicitly why he had been voted out.  We didn't then publically post anything about it, let alone that he had 'chosen' to leave, - we said that a few members including 2 officers (leldari was a lower officer) had left, and if anyone chose to leave and do something else with them, then god bless/good luck.<br>
<br>
I'm sorry these boards had to witness this, because it should be only the business of those involved and members of the guild.  We handled this the right way, and I regret  that Kikaki was hurt or embarassed enough by this and felt he had to position it to his friends as he did. <p><img src="http://www.myezboard.com/projects/ezboard/ezboard_userimages/hammerfall/images/caludan.jpg"><br>

Goht no he doesn't want to get back in....and actually I am not whining either. I am quite angry that friends were being lied to and so I posted in what I had hoped was a fairly safe manner. I actually thought this would sink into oblivion with only those directly effected caring enough to read it. Many posts do just that. Unfortunately there is a lack of bread and circuses on the EMarr boards.

Perhaps it's because an injustice has been done and people feel that others should be warned so that they do not fall into the same trap of deception/lies.<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<blockquote>Quote<br><hr>When a guild with a council of leaders has 5 leaders who can work as a team and one member who proves time and time again that he can't, it's time to move on.<hr></blockquote><br>
The original leadership of the guild started as seven counsil members, and it slowly dwindled as people had RL things pop up or what not. For quite a while the only active counsil members (guild leadership) that have been around have been me (kikaki), Caludan, Elderath and Yoku. Of these individual: Yoku was often not on or to busy in groups to address guild issues/members, Elderath was on a RL sabbatical, and Caludan was to busy to address guild issues/members. This left me (kikaki) as the one person who would leave camps and/or groups (or take a short break from them) to deal with any and all issues that anyone would have. I would deal with the good and the nasty issues.<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<blockquote>Quote<br><hr>None of us has claimed that the person who left left of their own will.<hr></blockquote><br>
When asked by guild members why I was no longer in the guild Caludan and Yoku both responded with "kikaki left withot saying a word to us" and "we promised him that we would not discuss it" which itself is a contradiction. If I left without a word when would you have had an oppertunaty to promise me anything?<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<blockquote>Quote<br><hr>I only discuss this now that they've broken their silence by posting and emailing flames all over the place, whereas we had commited to doing this quietly and privately so that the person leaving could do so with dignity.<hr></blockquote><br>
As everyone here has noticed that it was not I who posted this, I did not start this thread and I did not go out soliciting support against anyone. I guild removed myself quietly without any comments in guild chat or the Twisted Dreams messege boards. I responded to tells about me lack of guild tag by refering them to their guild leadership that was online rather then speak of any details. It was only then when the lies started filtering back to me from those who know me in real life and those who truly care and knew that something wasn't right about the answers they were receiving. I had saved the thread out of the counsil board so that I could go back and review the posts for my own personal reflection. Lucky that I did as it was my proof to my friends at the extent of what the rest of the active counsil members had done to me which were Elderath (who was inactive past month), Caludan (who has been holding a grudge about an argument a long time ago), and Yoku (who was pissed cause I asked him to stop flaming someone in guild chat which was part of our charter).<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<blockquote>Quote<br><hr>Kikaki, a council member, was voted out by the unanimous vote of all other present council members, per the rules he helped create.

I love how they can apply the guild charter to me but not to themselves. I was never approached with the behavior that they didn't approve/aggree with, nor anything of the matter. In the past there have been a couple cases where counsil member, and a normal member, who really abused guild members and had a very large negative impact yet the counsil kept wanting to "give him one more chance" and for them to "talk to him and ask him to change". Yet in my case everyone was done behind doors where I could not defend myself, I was not made aware anything was wrong, and I was never giving a second chance.<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>

I feel that I was directly threatened with the statement:<br>
<blockquote>Quote<br><hr>So, to be nice, as "guild leader" of Twisted Dreams (i.e. the only person who can remove your characters and get Erollisi Marr customer service to remove your characters if you don't log them in), I'm going to handle this differently than how this went with Warrbane.<br>
SO, you have 24 hours to resign your post, and remove your characters from the guild.<hr></blockquote><br>
Does this sound like i've been given any choice or chance? This is kind ? What happened to being decent and talking to me about any problems with me before deciding to remove me from the guild with a vote without warning. What kind of messege are you sending to people with "but we won't make that mistake again if this is where it leads anyways." ?? are the rest of your members going to huddle in fear knowing that they might be guild removed if they disagree with you and offend your on a personal level ? sounds like a natzi/gestopo (spelling??) type of situation which I am now glad that I am aware of and not part of.<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<blockquote>Quote<br><hr>Kikaki had in the past done a lot for the guild, and that was always appreciated. He is a strong competent leader, who would probably do wonderful in a guild in which he was the only leader. In a council of equals, it just didn't work.<hr></blockquote><br>
Counsil of equal? You mean where you (caludan and yoku know each other in real life, and had the oppertunaty to gang up on elderath (if that is what happened) and swing a magority vote of three people to vite me out of not only the guild counsil but of the entire guild as a whole? What didn't work, that I was willing to stand up to you and say "no, that is incorrect or inappropiate" when any of you took actions that were out of line? That you could not run the guild as YOU saw fit?<br>

Does anyone think that I personally set out to start this thread or post the messege board log or solicite support against my former guild? That answer is no. I refered all tells to their guild leadership. I sent my Real Life friends the messege board log because i felt they needed to know what happened because I just could not express what happened any other way in a believable manner. It was a "you have to see this with your own eyes" situation.<br>

Um... where? As anyone can see they never told me why I was being removed. No facts, No examples, No oppertunaty to right any supposed wrongs that I may have commited.<br>

Yoku, and caludan, responded to questions about why i was gone with a cookie-cutter response that "kikaki left of his own choice without a word" and yet again also "and we pormised him that we would not discuss it" which is where I am still missing something... if I left without a word... when could you have promised me anything ?<br>

And yes Cal, I did help Air dirty Laundry. I just couldn't sit back and listen to Lies. I felt posting that on here was well worth it, if I can save one person in TD from getting screwed over like Kik did. <p><img src="http://members.aol.com/phinderzkeeperz/phinder.jpg" width="500" height="250"><br>

When Yoku and Caludan flamed a former member on the guild boards for leaving and he responded the entire section was removed. All that was left was the initial farewell post....I truly felt the members had a right to know and I did try my damndest to keep it within the guild. But as the lies and misrepresentations continued in guildchat my anger finally overcame my good sense and I posted here.<br>
<br>
I had hoped that by not giving names it would not turn out the way it has. But life goes on and if people think less of me so be it. People who know me in game and real life know that I am a devoted friend and hate to see anyone done wrong. If my quest to deseminate the truth here was a disservice I apologize.  <br>
<br>
As to my character I think most people who know me know what kind of person I am. As to hurting my chance at uber guilds...oh well I am a paladin and a more or less casual player who would probably have no chance there anyway <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ughiastormwolf.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ghia Stormwolf</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 230<br> <font color=#E9D756>(2/19/02 11:00:58 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3067.topic&index=36>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Not unfair, just stupid.</span><hr size=1> Woot!<br>

<br>
Seems an officer who was always on,and not ditching his guild,helped out whenever and wherever he could.At the end of his guild tenure,he is quite pissed off at the other officers who do not log on/do not wish to deal with guild problems.So this officer treats his &quot;equals&quot; as beneath him,why? because he is doing all the work.<br>
<br>
Your &quot;council&quot; does not do it's job,fails to support each other in time of need,and when someone gets vocal when he feels he is doing all the work,you force him out?<br>
<br>
You claim he is a great leader,and others claim he is usually the only officer on/around to help,seems your guild is losing someone who worked his ass off for his guild,and got de-guilded for his work.<br>
<br>
good failures to you. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uphinder.showPublicProfile?language=EN>phinder</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 17<br> <font color=#E9D756>(2/19/02 4:03:48 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3067.topic&index=40>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Not unfair, just stupid.</span><hr size=1> bump cause I'm a jerk <p><img src="http://members.aol.com/phinderzkeeperz/phinder.jpg" width="500" height="250"><br>

If I was him, I'd walk away too.  With leadership like that, they'll fail yet again and be back in a few months with another guild name.  I think the funniest part is that their posts actually backed up what he said. (if you read the posts on the other link).  <br>
<br>
From what I get from the posts, this Yoku(?) person screwed up, got called on it by the &quot;working&quot; leadership in the guild,  got his buddy to gang up with him and get rid of the &quot;working&quot; leadership, THEN comes back, admits he was in the wrong, and the best part yet.. offers to help the screwed officer out in his &quot;move&quot; in any way.  Sounds like a coup to me.  Kikaki, you sound like you'd be a valued addition to a guild.  Just find a real one and not one run by RL cronies with 3rd world country politics. <p><a href="http://members.aol.com/wvvetteman/images/dalonhorse1.jpg" target="_blank">
