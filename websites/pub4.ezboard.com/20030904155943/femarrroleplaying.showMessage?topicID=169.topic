Maerah tapped a cadance nervously across her dragon drum and shifted, all too aware that the twisting cavern was similar to Lower Guk.  Frogluks clustered in the dim light, with one, holding a formidable ax, standing by himself in the corner.  He merely regarded the furtively whispering bard and rogue indifferently, ignoring them except to rumble a croak deep in his throat.<br>
<br>
“I bet he’s calling for a mate.  Why don’t you go apply?”  Pickett teased, folding up his map.<br>
<br>
“Why don’t you, fish lips, he’s more your style with those bandy legs.”  Mae shot back and grinned as he made a face at her.<br>
<br>
With his dark elven mask on, he was the most relaxed and comic Tier’Dal she had ever met.  It threw her image of the evil elves completely.  Even Mahdrohc and Tharoe, when wearing their dark elven guises, seemed more stoic.  Not so for the haffer rogue, he was as lighthearted in any form.  <br>
<br>
“So, you just hand him the fang and I hand him this spear.”  Pickett whispered into the darkness.  “And, cabam he gives me a key to Howling Stones.”<br>
<br>
“Cabam!?  There was no cabam mentioned before.  Something’s going to cabam?”  The bard looked near frantic.<br>
<br>
“Oh shush, it’s only a figure of speech now, come on.”<br>
<br>
Pickett handed a long and ornate spear to the axe-toting froglok who took it and waited expectantly.  Maerah saw her cue and held out a fang, recently cut from the body of a Sarnak in Kaesora.  The froglok snatched it from her grasp and threw a key at the triumphant Pickett.  <br>
<br>
“Got it!”  the rogue crowed.<br>
<br>
“Excellent, now let’s get outta here.”  Mae responded, starting up and out, pausing only when she saw Pickett was not following her.  Instead, he was staring at the froglok, or, more specifically, his gleaming axe.  <br>
<br>
“I think we can take him.  I want that axe.”<br>
<br>
Maerah’s eye rolled to the ceiling.  Too many rogues she knew were attracted to shiny things.  She appraised the froglok carefully.<br>
<br>
“He doesn’t look that tough, Pickett, you may be right.”  She grudgingly admitted, picking up her wristsnapper.  Picket’s own weapons were already in his hands.<br>
<br>
“So, what the pla…” she began<br>
<br>
“GET HIM!  Let’s gig him like the frog he is!  Time to die, Flipper Boy!”  The rogue plunged into combat, his blades whirling.  The bard’s voice rose at the same moment her mace thudded against the thick hide of the surprised froglok.  The creature began to cast spells furiously, so quickly even Yiamina would have been hardpressed to say “Zap.”  Pickett looked slower and weaker, and Mae found her own weapons felt sluggish in her hands.  She tried to counter, but she felt so sleepy.  Pickett continued to take a beating, and ice shards ripped through her own body as she gasped.  <br>
<br>
“RUN!!!”  Pickett screamed, fending off a flurry of froglok fists.  Maerah turned and bolted up the hallway, her song of Selos on her lips.  The rogue, right behind her, soon passed her and splashed through the water.  Mae took an awkward dive and let the swift current carry her to the mouth of the cave, where she was no longer pursued.<br>
<br>
Her exhausted and pain-wracked body floated gently next to his in a small eddyied pool.  With some satisfaction, she noted that he was in worse shape than she was, and the only sound was their strained breathing.<br>
<br>
“Get him.  That was your plan.  Get.  Him.”  Maerah struggled to regain control of her breathing.  <br>
<br>
“Well, he was a stupid frog.  He regenerated faster than anything I have ever seen!”  Pickett protested, picking a bit of moss from her hair.<br>
<br>
“Oh, you don’t get to be the hero anymore.  You’ve been demoted to sidekick.  I get to be the hero now.”  She smirked from her almost watery grave.<br>
<br>
“Sidekick?!  No way.  I look way better than you in spandex.  Well…”  He leered at her wet clothing.  <br>
<br>
She pinched him hard.<br>
<br>
“You no hero!  You been here 4 hour!  You get ass kicked by frog!  You no hero no more!  I no listen to you, Dr. Jones!”<br>
<br>
He laughed and then grimaced.<br>
<br>
“Ouch.  How was I supposed to know he could unleash Frogluk Fu all over us?”  Pickett protested.<br>
<br>
She spit a mouthful of water at him and he responded by heaving a fistful of river mud at her.  <br>
<br>
“It’s good to see you made it outta there alive, cement butt.”  He said fondly.  She made a face at him.  <br>

  I remember finding this particular froggie way back when, and asking the Knights whether I should leave a nonhostile necromancer to live. After some soul searching, I decided to test the waters. Fortunately I am very fast, since that necromancer had his own answer to my original question. Fortunately, he was too busy duplicating keys to chase me very far. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrroleplaying.showPrevMessage?topicID=169.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrroleplaying.showNextMessage?topicID=169.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrroleplaying.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=169.topic&index=1><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/gfx/addReply1.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrroleplaying.emailToFriend?topicID=169.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrroleplaying.threadControl?topicID=169.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/deleteThreadFire.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrroleplaying.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=169.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrroleplaying.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=169.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub4.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="emarrmessageboardrules">Message Board Rules<option value="emarrgeneral">General<option value="emarrbazaar">Item Bazaar<option value="emarrdragonsandplanes">Rants and Flames<option value="emarrlinks">Links<option value="emarrroleplaying">Roleplaying<option value="emarrroleplayingoocforum">Roleplaying - OOC Forum<option value="emarrreallife">Real Life<option value="emarrupcomingmmorpgs">Upcoming MMOG's<option value="emarrothermmorpgs">Other MMOG's<option value="emarrscammeralert">Scammer Alert<option value="emarrsignaturecorner">Test Forum<option value="emarrscrollsnspells">Spell Bazaar<option value="emarrfrm13">Dragons and Planes<option value="emarrfrm14">Bargain Basement<option value="emarrfrm15">Shiny Things<option value="emarrfrm17">Funny Stuff<option value="emarrfrm18">America Under Attack<option value="emarrfrm19">Dark Age of Camelot<option value="emarrfrm20">Crafter's Hideout</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#E9D756>- </font><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/bemarr>Erollisi Marr, The Queen of Love</a><font color=#E9D756> - </font><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrroleplaying>Roleplaying</a> <font color=#E9D756> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">Upgrade your account to ezSupporter...</a></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">...and never see another ad or pop-up again</a></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM AD SCRIPT -->
