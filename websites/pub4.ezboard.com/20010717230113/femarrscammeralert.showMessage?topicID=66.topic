I've seen some really elaborate plots that you have to say &quot;wow, thats smart&quot; to. No matter how completely screwed up scamming is you have to respect the intellignece some scammers for the pure ingenuity they use.<br>
<br>
I've also seen some stuff that you have to say &quot;you dumb shit,...how on earth do you expect that to work?&quot; and conversely &quot;How the fuck did you fall for that?&quot;<br>
<br>
Here's one thats a mixed bag. Its called &quot;How the hell do you expect that to work?...Jesus Verant your not really falling for it are you?&quot;<br>
<br>
Heres a new one.<br>
<br>
You auction &quot;Looking for Banana Helm or Staminaslayer ,..Selling RMB&quot;<br>
Piece_of_shit_I_never met_00 tells you &quot;Hey, thats my RMB, I only gave it to you for a loan&quot;<br>
<br>
I never met this guy...I won the damn RMB in Sol B and there were any number of people there to witness it.<br>
<br>
It got cleared up when I told him to fuck off or I would petition him for scamming. Guy logged off quick.<br>
<br>
But this isnt ONE isolated incident. Its happening a lot. I heard of one incident where someone did a price check on an item they were buying. (Bare in mind that its still in the hands of the seller.) When someone else decides to say that they owned the item and he would have to give it back. These scammers are actually petitioning GMs to bring an item they never had back to them. Should Verant fall for it? Hell no. But please be advised that this is an ongoing thing. Its got no base and ultimaely with enough GM interaction it will be stopped. Please petition everyone that tries this on you. Its probably some adolescent group of minds but lets clear em out asap.<br>

She asked me to please give the RMB back to Semodil. I told her again that the RMB was mine and that Id won it in Sol B. I told her to contact me again in 15 minutes when Id had chance to peruse my logs. She told me that logs could be faked and were not proof and could I please hand the item to Semodil.<br>
<br>
I went back to my logs and found the names of 4 of the other people in the group and logged on again.<br>
<br>
I contacted Adrizal and she told me that she had put a warning on my record for not giving the itme back. By now im hiting that minus key like a fooker gathering my evidence against a GM. I explained to her that I was willing to give her the names of the poeple in my group who could prove I had won it.<br>
<br>
She responded by telling me that I could only prove that I had won A RMB not THE RMB and repeated again. Please give the itme back to Semodil.<br>
<br>
At this point Im getting mad and with enough screenshots in my files to prove what I was about to say I sent her this tell.<br>
<br>
&quot;The item is mine. It is not, nor was it ever Semodil's. I do not know any Semodil. On whose authority am I being forced to give an item to a player who it did not belong to and why?&quot;<br>
<br>
Adrizal told me that Semodil was his alts name and that Psicobah was the person to whom the item belonged. She claimed to have multiple petitions from both characters saying the item was Psicobah's and a screenshot had been sent to VI of me selling the item and that was where she had the authority from.<br>
<br>
At which point I told her that I was no longer willing to continue with the conversation and I would be grateful if she would escalate it with the purpose of having me banned so I could speak to someone with a brain, who could deal with it properly.<br>
<br>
Guide Adrizal went silent.<br>
<br>
Furthermore I told her that I was selling the item and I had every right to do so considering it was MINE and that I had very successfully got 900pp for it.<br>
<br>
All conversations logged, screenshots to back it, 2 reports and an e-mail to Valtron.<br>
<br>
I await to see what is going to happen to this idiot guide, the original scammer and how many warnings Im going to get for being abusive to a GM.<br>
<br>
Hmmn.<br>
<br>
Beware of Psicobah and Semodil and more importantly Adrizal.<br>

<br>
    Breaking out into a cussing fit for no reason at all.<br>
<br>
    Thinking that you're better than your parents and can <br>
    do what ever you see fit... and then get arrested.<br>
<br>
    Saying that life isn't fair... Well, it isn't, but <br>
    since we all know it already you don't have to tell us <br>
    again.<br>
<br>
    Smoking under age.<br>
<br>
    Drinking under age.<br>
<br>
    Doing drugs... ok, well, that's not immature, that <br>
    means you're just plain STUPID.<br>
<br>
    Laughing at someone because you think you're better <br>
    than them... and then get the smack beat out of them in <br>
    a contest or a fight.<br>
<br>
    Not using proper spelling, well that's a given.<br>
<br>
    Saying &quot;Plz&quot; instead of Please, &quot;Thx&quot; instead of <br>
    Thanks, &quot;u&quot; instead of you, &quot;2&quot; instead of to, etc.<br>
<br>
    Saying adults are pathetic, who do you think pays your <br>
    bills and gives you a home if you're not one?<br>
<br>
    Bashing on someone you obviously shouldn't be bashing <br>
    on.<br>
<br>
*hears the school bells ring* It's class time, Nathureba.  Come home with straight A's and I might just give you a Clarity 2 instead of a Breeze! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Young people that act like that are going to turn into those pathetic adults i mentioned before... stupidity, immaturity and bad behavior doesnt depend on age.<br>
Believing in stereotypes is a great sign of immaturity btw.<br>
If showing you´re a big male adult ruler of your small world<br>
makes you happy.. well go on I won´t post anything against you... You were young once, and you know how you would hate to hear that from an adult.. well whatever this is a game board i wont reply on this subject anymore<br>
<br>
Nuff said<br>
