<br>
I don't see why people in "uber" guilds even both to complain about loot? I just really don't see why!<br>
<br>
Ok, here is the scene. Velk's Lab, Ledge. A group of 6, one person playing TWO characters at once. We just invite a shadowknight to play around about 10 minutes before this happens. A frenzied velium broodling spawns and raises holy hell on our group. He drops Silver Chitin Hand Wraps (so ubah, I almsot cried... not) and we begin to roll. I aks for everyone who's in to say so. The person who was playing both characters had already rolled with both characters on a pair of Silver Chitin Hand Wraps earlier, and had won them. Now, he begins to bitch when the shadowknight we let in asks to roll on them. His excuse (not in exact words I didn't have /log on) "I was here all morning." and well this proceeded about how his character OTHER character (the one who hadn't won SCHW's or anythin') should get a chance to roll. Also, he begins to bitch at a member who was their longer then him about how he can't win another pair of Silver Chitin Hand Wraps since he already had a pair.<br>
<br>
Sub-story :: The person who wanted to roll, but already had a pair was borrowing his pair for a friend. He had lost his corpse a while back and was gonig to return the pair.<br>
<br>
So, we finally worked it out, and the person who actaulyl needed them lost the roll and the frantic bitch'er won them for this other character.<br>
<br>
-------<br>
<br>
I know that sounds a little odd, I'm not use to writing rants but I really em a bit fed up with this. Why must people who are in guilds go on raids to places that barely anyone else can, and get loot that FAR surpasses ANYTHING that could drop in this zone bitch about loot. I mean, who brag for about the first 2 hours how you could have your cleric get his epic in less then a month, and how you could have all this insanely nice gear I'll probably only get to /drool over, and then you go and bitch about a pair of 4.5k gloves that you ended auctiong off WHILE STILL IN MY @#%$ GROUP! WHY!?<br>
<br>
Someone, please just tell me I'm not the only one who hopes these sort of people would just die. <p><b><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=147443 ">Paio</a></b><br>

Maybe I'm misunderstanding, but that's what I got from your rant.  This person sounded like an ass, but don't condemn everyone else in his, and other, guilds.  The &quot;uber&quot; guilds work for what they get.  I put in my time as much as anyone else to get what I had, and I was damn glad to have it.  But, you won't see me whining about not getting gear that I don't need.<br>
<br>
The guy is an ultimate @#%$.  He should not have been allowed to roll for an item he's already won.  No, he was not doing double the work.  I don't care what anyone says, NO ONE can play two characters as well as two different people.  You are unable to put your full attention towards playing both characters, so you really shouldn't get double the benefit.  But, this sounds like an isolated incident so QUIT GENERALIZING!  &quot;Uber&quot; guilds aren't at fault, this person was.

<br>
Which guild? Which person? You see when you post something like this you are meant to mention names of guilds and people so we know what and who the fvck you are talking about. Without these names your rant is pointless and sucks harder than a hoover with a jet engine.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> The person who was playing both characters had already rolled with both characters on a pair of Silver Chitin Hand Wraps earlier, and had won them.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
So they had won two pairs or just one? From the looks of it you are quite happy to have this person provide their services via 2 characters for the group but not let them both roll or both win. If I played two characters I would expect to be able to roll once and win, then roll again and win on the other character if I was lucky enough. Just because one person plays two characters doesn't mean that you have the right to exclude the other character from rolls just because their first character won one of them. Both of this persons characters are playing and working to provide the groups safety they both deserve to roll and/or win if lucky enough. If you don't like the way that they deal with loot then either kick them or remove yourself from the group.<br>

<br>
So just because someone may be in an &quot;uber guild&quot; it means that they cannot frequent zones or win loot that is less than &quot;uber???&quot; Read my last sentence slowly 5 times to yourself and realise how ridiculous you sound. Need before greed is a wonderful concept however it hardly ever works, besides did you announce a loot policy to all people you were grouped with? Or did you just assume everyone would follow Need Before Greed?<br>

It is <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> my</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> opinion that once the <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> person</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> wins something, he let's the other people win something.  That would be the honorable thing to do.  No one is asking his second character to leave, yet at the same time, no one is forcing him to stay.  Besides, 90% of the time, when someone is playing two people in a group, they are of very different classes and would not both need to roll on the same item.  For instance, if someone is playing a monk and an enchie, the monk would benefit from the hand wraps, the enchie would not.  The only reason for the enchanter to roll on the item is greed, especially if the monk already won a pair.  In this case, it is apparent that only one of the characters got any use from the item as he was auctioning off his second pair.  I tell you what, that takes absolutely NO class to do that, especially when you're still in the group.  I will say this, however, there is no reason for this rant.  You allowed this to happen by letting him roll on a second pair.  I agree with Dwarkarn on the fact that you could have booted him from the group, or left the group yourself.  Don't let something happen only to bitch about it later.<br>
<br>
I'll say it again, <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> no one</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> can play two characters as well as two people can play their own.  I don't care how skilled they are at the individual characters, when the @#%$ gets hot, they will be lacking as their attention is divided, in most cases.  I'll be damned if someone can play a druid and another character better than I could play my druid. <p>"I will take love wherever I find it and offer it to everyone who will take it, seek knowledge from those wiser, and teach those who wish to learn from me" - Duane Allman</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ucurmy.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Curmy</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 60<br> <font color=#E9D756>(6/23/02 1:58:32 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3431.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Someone, please...</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> I've seen someone play 6 characters at once better than 6 people.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

There is no way a single person could control 6 characters and play better than a group made up of 6 individuals...unless the 6 individuals are all from MF I guess. <p>Players in EverQuest:<br>

it's not amazingly hard to play 2 characters at one time. for one your attention is not split totaly, because both characters are in the same situation, you just have to react to the same situation from 2 different points of view.  if you were in 2 different places with both, now that would be insane.<br>
<br>
Now the fact that some can, and some cannot play 2 characters well raises a bit of a problem. naturaly you cannot divy loot in an XP group by skill, less thier would be a @#%$ load of naked 55+ chars.  Also, NBG in XP groups does not work worth a crap IMO, some classess will never bennifit from some camps, where as others will reap all the reward.  Lord knows how easy it would be for any one to move equip to an alt, go back to any camp, and say they need XX item when it drops again.  Yet with random all, if you get an item you don't need. you sell it, and buy one you do.  every one can use the 4.5K the handwraps in question here goes for, uber, not uber, caster, melee ect.  4.5K is not a small chunk of change. the only exception beeing no drop items.<br>
<br>
So in conclusion, if some one plays two characters well, they should (unless specifacly stated otherwise) roll for any item with both chars. if they play 2 characters badly  you should kick one from the group.  only reasonsto keep some one with 2 charters that cannot play both because 1 or both are nessisary to the camp, at which point some one that cannot play 2 chars well will just get you killed.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/upaiothemonk.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Paio the Monk</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 99<br> <font color=#E9D756>(6/23/02 8:31:16 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3431.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: someone, did...</span><hr size=1> Ha, I vent a bit of frustation and I start a conflict about dual-playing...

OK, now I am confused..<br>
<br>
You plan to join this 'uber' guild that a member of pissed you off?  Because of this you leave out names? (or name as the case may be)  <br>
<br>
Just because you didnt name a guild name or a player name, doesnt mean that the person playing at that time (providing he read this or heard about it) isnt goint to forget..<br>
<br>
OR<br>
<br>
Is the HAD in that above quote because you will not be seeking membership in that un-named guild becauseo f this loot issue?<br>

The signature displayed in my post not clear enough for you Laoke?<br>
<br>
Perhaps if I signed my name Duttan it would fire a synapse or 2? Either way who I am is irrelevant and has no bearing on whether my statement is correct.<br>
<br>
I stand by what I said in my original post. It is not possible for 1 person to control 6 characters and play better than 6 individuals. Anyone who disagrees is a fool.<br>
<br>
Laoke is a fool regardless of whether she disagrees though...just wanna make that clear. <br>

It sounds pretty rough what you went through on that group. To alleviate this situation next time maybe you should set the loot rules before hand. If it was NBG, and he won the rolls, and then the next minute is auctioning it off, there is plenty of room to flame this individual.  <br>
<br>
As far as who can play what or however many characters better, WHO CARES?! If the roles are covered, and the group is okay with this setup, then run with it. If not, find someone else to fill the double's spot.<br>

<br>
Nice insult to MF here, Curmy.  I didn't say anything initially because I thought maybe you just mangled what you were trying to say.  From your reply to Laoke, apparently you knew exactly what you were saying.  I won't return the favor by insulting your guild -- unlike you with MF, I actually have had the opportunity to observe a lot of Shok members in action and I know they are good people, and fine players.  You personally, on the other hand, are an ignorant jackass.<br>

<br>
Heck one person could probably handle stuff a pickup group can't since he knows exactly what he can expect from his groupmates. <br>
<br>
Knowing the limitations and abilities of your group increases the potential for your group tenfold.<br>
<br>
Sure there is the fact that you cant actually be using more than 2 keyboards simultaneously so there may be a few seconds while all the characters in the group are not performing to maximum potential, but, most groups made up of six individual players have a similar delay as the people get distracted, go afk etc...<br>
<br>
Personally, the most I have ever done is four characters at once on four separate PCs and only to clear a couple rounds of fire giants, not something I would do for fun. The four characters were a warrior a wizard a bard and a cleric.<br>
<br>
I am impressed that someone can play six characters at once, and can see how it can be done with a decent keyboard and monitor layout...but it would seem more like work than a game to play it that way. I prefer to play two characters at most at any given time and on faster paced activities, I prefer only one. <br>
