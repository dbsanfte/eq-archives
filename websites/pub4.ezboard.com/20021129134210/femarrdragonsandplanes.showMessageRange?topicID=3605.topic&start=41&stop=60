  I'm gonna start from the original post and try to not duplicate what Wyvern has already discussed.  I'll try to grab sentences to quote that express your topics.  As I read your post, I realize you have a ton of topics and nuances in there.<br>
<br>
  What you first must realize is that many of your statements are opinions, right or wrong.  Once you come to that admission, we can talk.  I'll do the same.  What I am about to say are opinions based on what I have heard / read and believe to be facts.<br>
<br>
  Snippy logic comment:<br>
<br>
  &quot;Take Afganistan..I never once heard it reported that more civilians and friendlies were killed than enemy fighters, but thats what happened.&quot;<br>
<br>
  That may be true, but your number sounds like propaganda.  Let's say... 2 citizens and 1 fighter, your statement holds true.  Let's say our methods of capturing as opposed to simply wantonly slaying have developed, yet there was that wedding accident.  How important do you really think your &quot;ratio&quot; still is?<br>
<br>
  &quot;And then people don't understand why September 11th happened.&quot;<br>
<br>
  Why don't you explain why, then?  Why exactly did 9/11 happen?  Y'know, in all my readings, I have never found a good document outlining what policies the middle east hates.  What drove them to such lengths.  Also, since no one would even admit to the attack (it seems to me that most terrorists inform the world of what they did so people actually know what their demands are), we're even more left in the dark.<br>
<br>
  When 9/11 happend, I felt myself begging to simply hear the terrorist's demands.  &quot;Why won't they tell us why they did this?&quot; I asked my brother.<br>
<br>
  You talk about free trade a bit and I am not educated in that area enough to hold a good conversation.  I do believe that the U.S. govt has made some recent mistakes involving steel and whatnot.  Free trade really isn't an amazingly emotional topic for me, though, I don't see why you'd get PO'd about it.<br>
<br>
  You speak of the environment as if the U.S. is the major polluter in the world, when recent figures seem to be showing that most pollution originates from poor countries.  You can almost draw a line... the poorer the nation, the worse their impact on the environment is.  Asian Brown Cloud, anyone?  The U.S. is a bad polluter... all pollution is bad, but I disagree that the U.S. comes anywhere close to generating the amount seen in many other parts of the world.<br>
<br>
  The wealth of the U.S. also lends us the ability to produce technology which is far less polluting.  Long after everyone in the U.S. drives a hydrogen car, there will be what... a billion gassers still running around the rest?<br>
<br>
  You speak about U.S. responsibilities and I agree.  Y'know, we practically fund the U.N. if I recall.  If the U.S. didn't give what we do to the U.N., I bet it would cease to exist.  We give more money to the rest of the world then any other country by such a massive amount it is mind boggling.  I'm talking about if you made a pie chart out of it, the U.S. would cover over half and ALL the rest of the countries would be crammed in the rest.  Of course, it seems today that purely money doesn't do dick.  It might have all been for naught, but was it not with good intentions at least?<br>
<br>
  You speak about democracy etc blah and you're right.  I'm not a very political person, but y'know we really can't just up and throw Bush out because some countries don't like him.  When he comes up for re-election, if the public feels he's done a bad job then out he goes.  Hey, maybe I hate Blair, but I can't say, &quot;Hey you UK guy, Get rid of Blair!#@$.&quot;  That feels ridiculous to type and I think you should feel silly as well.<br>
<br>
  You speak of the U.S. throwing its weight around and I agree that can be bad.  The world view is that the U.S. acts purely on unilateral terms and we have only ourselves to blame for that perception.  On the other hand, due to the U.S. being a super power, we are expected to help the world as well, and how do we do that?  Throwing our weight around.  I would love it if we threw our weight around and it did nothing but good.  You hate it because you see nothing but bad.  Come to a medium and admit that the U.S. makes mistakes and sometimes really does help.<br>
<br>
  You speak of unsustainable rhetoric, but that is what these discussions are when they are done inside of circles of people who aren't poly sci majors.  That's just the way this @#%$ is.  I don't buy a good chunk of your opinions and my reasons are above.  You MOST likely won't buy what I said above, either.  It's all rhetoric and it's draining to the point where there isn't much reason to go back and proofread all that much.  It's not logical, it's all opinion.  Pretty much a trash discussion all around.<br>

So dont advocate rebellion. The Civil War settled that issue.<br>

<br>
George W. Bush is an idiot (referred to as Dubya from here on out).<br>
<br>
Dubya was not elected by the general voting populous of the U.S., Albert Gore was. I voted for McCain in the Republican primaries so shut your dittohead pieholes before you start on that &quot;liberal&quot; bullshite.<br>
<br>
Sharon was convicted of neglegence in the massacre in Lebanon, he was never directly found to be responsible for the killings. <br>
<br>
The Ottoman Empire was a good thing, 1000 years and not a peep out of that region until the first world war.<br>
<br>
We don't have 8 litre engines in any of our cars.<br>

New York is *not* the rest of the US, as a matter of fact it's almost a country in and of itself.

We started a military buildup at that time, then the UN stepped in and negotiated for inspectors to come back. The US held back. 10 months later, Iraq kicked the inspectors out again. The US and England started a bombing campaign on Iraq.<br>
<br>
My question is...<br>
<br>
Do you think Iraq is less a threat now than in 1998 when Clinton said it was a great threat? I believe it is more of a threat, and I don't see how we can hold back and not do something. We can't continue to play this cat-and-mouse game with weapons inspectors.<br>

<br>
I wanted to point out how the electoral system doesn't always represent the popular vote. Gore won the popular vote by about 450,000 votes. Bush won the general election by 5 electoral votes.<br>
<br>
If Gore had taken Florida he'd have won, that's why it was an issue in the first place.<br>

Just imagine the insanity of a nation-wide recount.  Hell, the political machine here in Chicago would probably just manufacture votes until whoever they wanted won the election.<br>

Anyway, the rules are the rules.  The world series goes to the team that wins four games, not the team that scores the most runs... no one would claim to have &quot;actually won&quot; the series if their team won three games by 10-1, and lost four games 3-2.<br>

<br>
Actually this is not entirely correct. We never did formally declare war on Iraq. And the National Defense Service Medal is authorized by the President. For Desert Shield/Storm this medal was awarded from 1990-1995. Recently the President has authorized it's awarding again from Sep 11, 2001 until present. Hence, I now wear a bronze star on mine(signifying my second awarding of it). This medal has no requirement for the country to be officially at war, it is completely at the President's discretion.<br>
<br>
As far as Iraq today, I have mixed feelings. As a member of the military, there are still many of us who remember Desert Shield/Storm and our middle eastern allies who were clamoring for our help when it appeared Saddam might continue on into Saudi Arabia. Now these same countries are defending this madman.  And I remember our President's pledge to go after any terrorist, and anyone who supports or sponsors terrorism. Trust me Iraq very clearly fits in that category.<br>
<br>
But, I don't want to see my fellow servicemen go into this area with no local support. If we do attack I don't believe our casualties will be as light for Desert Storm. We won't have the forward bases or allied support to pull of a sustained campaign like we did then. We would have to attack fast, attack hard, and because of that incur casualties.<br>
<br>
As far as our country being nationalistic and segregationist, well we have a history of that. I think it is true of every country that they look out for themselves first. In a ideal world all the greater powers of the world would have wiped out hunger, disease, pollution, war, and other nasty things ages ago. But this is a real world, where countries are always going to focus on their interests first.<br>

<br>
Firstly, the US is the world cop because it says it is, not due to others shirking duty. Most Eurpean nation have more history of war than America does with hot dinners.<br>
<br>
As far as Yugoslavia went, all advice given to America is that they'd be involved in a Vietnam to the power of ten. The Serbs, traditionally, are tenacious and skilled guerilla fighters. They have harried and harassed all comers to their lands since the early days of the Ottoman Empire. <br>
<br>
America, for all its panoply and bottomless wallet re: military expenditure, would've been given hell in Serbia in an all-out conflict. Would've been a very bad pyrrhic victory.<br>
<br>
No military power is unbeatable, including the US, despite propaganda to the contrary.<br>
<br>
The Afghans are even more accustomed to the defense of their lands than the Serbs are. Look at the grief they gave the former USSR. The USSR had a larger military force than America's and weren't exactly green troops. And atthe end of the day, their objective wasn't even met. Sadly, 11 months later, the US's objective in Afghanistan is far from completed.<br>
<br>
As for Europe using diplomacy rather than brute force, well, where did the last two World Wars start? Hint: Not Lexington, Ky, I can assure you.<br>
<br>
Europe has had its share of battles, throne-wrestling, genocide and sabre-rattling. Forgive them if they're a little leery of jumping in with all guns blazing. They've been doing that since the Fall of Rome and beyond.<br>

<br>
Everything was fine until you said this.  I still don't understand why it happened.  I am not one to understand the mind of someone so full of hate for another that they murder 3000 people simply going to work.  This act is beyond my comprehension, just as it would be if it was committed against any other country in the world.  This act was committed by those who have a rhetoric on their own side that is just as reprehensible, if not moreso, than anything coming out of the US.<br>
<br>
I'm not a superpatriot... heck, I'm not even buying into the post-11th patriotism that's supposedly sweeping the country (according to you).  I don't agree with my government's current mideast stances, including the apparent willingness to attack Iraq.  But I'm not going to sit here and allow you to offhandedly justify an attack against my country which cost the lives of thousands of innocents.  Unfortunately, the government doesn't always speak with the voice of the American people, which we hate as much as anyone else - but you'd know that, if you were as familiar with my country as you claim to be.  We as citizens do the best we can to put up a leader that will do just that, but we haven't managed to get it 100% correct yet.  My apologies, but that doesn't mean any other person on this entire planet has any right to choose to kill American citizens because of it regardless of their reasons. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uelnotssadnes.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Elnots Sadnes</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 398<br> <font color=#E9D756>(9/7/02 2:51:39 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3605.topic&index=55>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: What on earth is the US playing at?</span><hr size=1> I wish I had actually read this thread sooner, that was alot of reading.

<br>
One thing, the world does not see eye to eye. The needs of one country are different from the needs of another. You shouldn't bother yourself with the workings of someone elses country. That goes for America and Britian as well. Stop debating over who's country is better than the other. So what if Britian does things differently than Americans do, they aren't Americans. Same goes the other way around.<br>
<br>
And what did you hope to accomplish here? Making Americans stop to think, you're right, I hate my country! And personally, I love Canada, it's just like America cept nobody lives there. <br>
<br>
Seriously though, if you don't like America, but don't plan on doing anything about it. Bitching falls on deaf ears. Move to Mexico, maybe they will give you a better life than you have here. <br>
<br>
And speaking of Mexico, I can't believe the thought would enter your head that, watch out, the Mexicans are getting support to take back these states. I can't speak for the others, but I know damn straight Texans wouldn't let this state back into Mexican hands. The great country of Texas won it's independence from Mexico by defeating Mexican armies, and was later allowed to be annexed into the US. Mexico tries to take over Texas and they're gonna have to try to get past all the Southern boys with their shotguns and rifles saying, bring it. <p><img src="http://moongaden.homestead.com/files/elnots.jpg

This is not comparable to 2 innings won by huge margins against 3 lost innings or somehow counting 6 seats comprised with 2 cows and a famer each, versus 300000 voters all crammed in one seat (all 300000 voting pro-'X').    <br>
<br>
Electoral Boundaries (geographic area of the map allotted to each seat) can be rigged to concentrate traditional pro-'X' votes into 1 seat (or as few seats as can fit all the pro-'X' voters). Whilst other seat boundaries can carefully be drawn along that same electoral map to apportion <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>just enough</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> pro-'Y' votes as will secure a simple majority in as many seats as can be achieved for 'Y' particularly when given a theoretical number of pro-'Y' voters available to distribute among them. <br>
<br>
This tactic is termed a 'Gerrymander': a stacked poll. Such a poll result notionally ought be declared an Constitutionally invalid return due to being a majority vote without acknowledged declaration of a majority result...<br>
<br>
I don't know the US system, so this is just a working sketch for getting seats in the House by representative majority vote, or losing those seats through minority weighting.  <p><p><br><br><h1 align="LEFT"><font size=1>signed Mistyglen</h1></font></p><p><br><h1 align="CENTER"><font size=1>A GREEN Dragon lies beneath!</font></h1>

My point is, that if Europeans won't lift a finger to stop mass genocide in their own backyard, why should Americans be surprised that they oppose a war in Iraq?  Europe opposes all military action, no matter what the circumstances.  It's like a broken record.  Almost to the point where I hardly pay any attention to what Europeans think anymore, because their opinion is always the same, no matter what the circumstances-- wait and see, negotiate, appease, etc.  It's never &quot;let's go fix that&quot;, &quot;let's preempt/prevent this&quot;.
