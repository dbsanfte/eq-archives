<br>
<br>
<br>
"You stay out here, you’re no match for what’s inside." The grizzled veteran ranger growled, as he pushed me toward the wall. Although my pride stung to admit it, I knew he was right. I had just entered my ninth season as a Ranger of Faydark, and although I had gained my magic, oft times as not it fizzled into thin air.<br>
<br>
I stood outside, looking at castle CrushBone, aching to cleanse the area of the foul orcs that had DARED to make encampments near my home. I had cut my teeth as they say, fighting those orcs along the border between Clan CrushBone and my own fair Faydark. I had learned all I could stopping those weak attempts at invasion, and now it was time to return the favor. While I was no match for the Emperor, I could keep his centurions from storming back into the castle.<br>
<br>
While these thoughts filled my head, my attention was drawn to a commotion near the castle bridge. As I watched, a sputtering figure flew back out of the column of wood elves heading for the castle entrance. The form nimbly hopped to his feet. I recognized him as a gnome I had seen in Kelethin. I knew he had a reputation as a good fighter of about the same experience as I. Before he could storm back into the column, I grabbed him by the collar. He whirled on me with murder in his eye. I jumped out of the way of his blade in the nick of time.<br>
<br>
‘Hold, Friend!" I cried, raising my hands.<br>
<br>
"Stupid Wood Elves! You’re lucky I didn’t kill you." He growled.<br>
<br>
"I know, but I had a plan I wanted to share with you. Perhaps we could join together and guard the castle walls? I’m Wunderr, Ranger of Faydark, at your service." <br>
<br>
"Corleone, warrior." The gnome stuck his hand out.<br>
<br>
I grinned as I shook his hand. It seemed this gnome’s mood had changed in an instant. "We’ll have to be careful, I’ve heard that Oracles and Legionnaires sometimes patrol this area."<br>
<br>
"Aye, it will be some time before I want to fight a Legionnaire, even with your help." With that, he tromped off following the wall.<br>
<br>
It wasn’t long before we found our first victim. We attacked the centurion with the fervor of youth, hacking our blue-skinned enemy virtually in half.<br>
<br>
The next hour was a haze of muscle, sinew, and purplish blood. Corleone would bellow with rage as his wounds became too great. I was hard put to keep up with the damage the little warrior was taking, let alone the gouges and cuts the orcs were inflicting on me. On the brighter side, I was becoming much better at casting my weak healing spell.<br>
<br>
"We’re going to have to withdraw and tend our wounds after this one, Wood Elf." Corleone grunted, as his sword bit into the side of a centurion.<br>
<br>
‘Aye, I’m exhausted, and I don’t know if I have the strength to cast heal." I agreed.<br>
<br>
We bore down on the orc, confusing him with teamwork. Every time he had one of us, the other would strike. Corleone’s blade was a whir of speed, my axe hacked pieces of orc hide with every swing. Suddenly, the tide turned. I saw a huge lumbering form come from around the corner. Our worst fears had been realized, a Legionnaire had found us, and we were far from peak condition.<br>
<br>
To give us credit, we hurt the foul creature. But it was a losing battle, we were both too weak to outrun the monster. Our only option was to stand and fight. Corleone was taking the brunt of the attack, but it was only a matter of time until he fell and the Legionnaire turned on me. As if on cue, Corleone slipped in the mud and the Legionnaire sprung for the killing blow. <br>
<br>
I gritted my teeth and shouted, "Have at thee!"<br>
<br>
"You want to fight, little elf? I will show you what Emperor Crush’s Legionnaires can do. Prepare to die." With that. He swung his sword at my head. I raised my shield, barely deflecting the blow, one could hardly call it "blocking."<br>
<br>
Corleone had regained his feet, and was heading back into the fray, when he was enveloped in a blue glow. The gnome’s wounds seemed to close, and I saw him smile a little, at what I couldn’t see. From over my shoulder, I saw a blur of movement.<br>
<br>
Seemingly from nowhere a figure, nearly as tall as the Legionnaire, let out a war cry. The orc turned his head toward the new threat and received a crushing hammer blow to the face. "Looks like you fellows could use some help." Our seven foot tall barbarian savior said.<br>
<br>
She was fresh to battle, Corleone tried to help, but truthfully she finished the legionnaire by herself. As the battle ended the barbarian turned and threw us into an alcove. "Get out of sight."<br>
<br>
"So, what in Norrath possessed you two to come into Clan CrushBone without any real means of healing?" She scolded, all the while casting healing spells and tending to our wounds. "I mean, did you two even stop to think? You’re lucky I happened by when I did!"<br>
<br>
I nearly blushed in embarrassment, but Corleone was turning red for another reason entirely, "Listen here…"<br>
<br>
"Alinane"<br>
<br>
"…Alinane, I really appreciate the save but it looks to ME like YOU were wandering around here alone yourself!"<br>
<br>
"Ah, but I’m in my god’s service, I was in no danger, for I was cloaked from these fiends sight. At least I was until I was forced to cast. But listen! These brutes offend me as much as they do you. Let us join together in battle!"<br>
<br>
"Aye, it would seem a good idea, but I’ll have none of that barbarian nonsense. ‘Rub the gnome’s head til it shines’ for ‘luck.’ I’ll show you it’s BAD luck to rub my skull."<br>
<br>
"It’s a deal!" she exclaimed with a laugh.<br>
<br>
Corleone turned and started to lead out of the alcove. Alinane and I close behind. I noticed a small smile on Alinane’s face and suddenly, she reached down and brushed the top of Corleone’s head, muttering "For luck."<br>
<br>
‘It’s not shining." She laughed defensively as she marched past the scowling warrior.<br>
<br>
The rest of our continued, with Alinane helping it became almost humdrum. We were the perfect balance to fight our chosen foes. Apparently Alinane’s brush for luck had worked it’s magic. We were all in good spirits when we marched victorious back to Kelethin. If only we could find someone to shrink Alinane so she could fit in the bank.<br>
<br>
…the Beginning.<br>
<br>
Wunderr<br>
<br>
Knight of the Realm, <br>
<br>
First Circle of the Vanguard of the Iron Crown<br>
<br>
  <br>
 <br>
 <br>
<br>
Loves Lost <br>
<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
          I stand alone and look at my world. After many years of companionship, my love is gone. A future which had looked full of life and brimming with hope only yesterday, seems a bleak dark place. I have told the tale of meeting my love, now I must tell the story of her passing. <br>
<br>
          Many battles had come and gone, many victories were gained, but not without cost. In the early years, Alinane, Corleone and I, Wunderr Mapleleaf, were nearly constant companions. In our times of greatest peril, we had but to look over our shoulder to find a friend to stand our back through the storm. <br>
<br>
          It was in those early days that my sister, the brave and beautiful Melinaquin Fairheart, called upon me to become a Knight of the Realm of beside her in the Vanguard of the Iron Crown. When I answered her summons, I brought with me Corleone and Alinane. I assumed my familial duties with pride, and began to help organize our guild into a force to drive back the spreading evil in Norrath. But even my duties with the Vanguard could not separate me from my companions. <br>
<br>
          Alinane, Corleone and I joined an assault on the Estate of Unrest. Terrible were our losses that dreadful day. If not for Alinane I would have lain dead in that evil place, perhaps to rise as one of the undead myself. Instead I lived, and grew closer to my beautiful barbarian friend. <br>
<br>
          Corleone left us one eve, saying he had heard of far off deserts, and that it was in his heart to explore them. He walked off with that swagger that only a gnome warrior can effect. Forever burned into my mind is that final wave of his hand. We never saw nor heard news of him again. <br>
<br>
          The next few years saw the Vanguard of the Iron Crown grow ever stronger. My position changed, although I was still the advisor to my sister Melinaquin, I had moved from the Knight of the Realm to the rank of Knight Sage. My duties forced me to range far and wide across the face of Norrath. Alinane had her own duties that at times kept us apart for months. Even so, when we found ourselves together, those intervening months seemed to vanish. Our love was growing, though neither of us spoke of such things. <br>
<br>
          One night in Kelethin, I lay on my back worrying over the problems of the day, when came a rather timid knock at the door. “Sir Wunderr, this just arrived on the innkeeps doorstep. It’s addressed to you.” The young wood elf handed me a battered scroll. It said simply on the outside “Wunderr Mapleleaf.” I marveled that it had found me at all. The seal was intact, and I broke it open to read. <br>
<br>
<br>
  <br>
 <br>
 “My dearest Wunderr, <br>
<br>
         I am casting this letter on the winds to reach you. If the Tribunal is willing, it will find you in time, if not, then I will see it as a  sign to move on. <br>
<br>
         I have spent many months fighting alongside a new companion. His name matters not, but his honor knows no bounds. He has asked for my hand in marriage. <br>
<br>
        Although he is not the first to ask in our many times of separation, he is an honest man and a trustworthy friend. I do not love him, but I am tempted, for I am well past the age that those of my clan marry. <br>
<br>
       There is one thing that holds me back. I have yet to be asked by the man I love. If he loves me, and the gods are willing, perhaps I may have the life I want, and not settle for less. <br>
<br>
       In this, the last of my letter, I do something ancient among my people. I invoke the Tribunal that this letter may reach you. My life and happiness is in their hands. <br>
<br>
                                           My Fate flies with this letter, <br>
<br>
                                           My heart lies with you.<br>
<br>
<br>
Alinane” <br>
<br>
  <br>
  <br>
 <br>
<br>
          As I read the last line of the message, lightning flashed across the sky. The storm that had been threatening all day broke with fury such as I had never seen. I sat on my bunk shaking with a fear, that had nothing to do with the storm. I allowed myself to feel what I had been denying, and with these feelings came the dread that I was too late. <br>
<br>
          I reached in my pack, searching for the stone I needed. My hand clutched at a small object and I hurridly pulled it out. It was not the stone, it was a small gold band with a brilliant diamond inset. Astonished, I set the ring aside. I had not put it in my pack. Again I reached to find the stone, and seemingly of it’s own accord, it fell to the floor at my feet. <br>
<br>
          I picked it up and concentrated as my brother-in-law had taught me. “Paithan, can you hear me, brother?”<br>
<br>
          “Wunderr, is that you?” I heard my old friend reply faintly.<br>
<br>
          “Aye, Paithan, I am in great need. I must travel far and as fast as I ca..” <br>
<br>
          So great was the need in my voice, that my sister’s husband did interrupt, “Meet me by the Wizard Spires, I will be there by the time you reach them.”<br>
<br>
          As the storm reached its peak, I found myself running through the woods I had played in as a child. I ran by the city of the High Elves, and lightning lit the path in front of me. Standing there, bloody and surrounded by giant wasps, was a young paladin. Although my heart ached to keep running, I could not let the young one perish, even if it meant losing my happiness. I stood by him and healed him as he fought off his enemies. When the last of them fell, he turned to thank me, but I had already begun running again. <br>
<br>
          I approached the mystical stones, and the lightning tapered off. Paithan was standing in the middle of the spires. Just as I arrived, one last bolt of lightning arced across the sky. In that flash, I saw six hulking figures holding hammers surrounding the stones. In the next instant, they were gone. <br>
<br>
          “Paithan, it is good to see you,” I said, shaking off the vision. <br>
<br>
          He scowled at me, as is his way, “Where do you need to go, Wunderr? By the sound of your voice, we don’t have time to waste.” <br>
<br>
          “When I last saw Alinane she mentioned the Karanas. Perha....” A shimmering portal opened and drew me in. The next instant I was staring at the stone bridge leading to South Karana. Paithan arrived an instant later. <br>
<br>
          He looked at me with his scowl, then suddenly broke into a smile. “You finally woke up, didn’t you, little brother? Go find her.” <br>
<br>
          “I wi... “ was all I got out before the portal took him again. <br>
<br>
          The details of finding her are boring in the telling. Let us just say that I blessed Tunare for bestowing upon me the skills of a Ranger before the night was done. It was nearing sunset the next day when I saw Alinane standing in the gorge of East Karana. <br>
<br>
          From behind me the sun shown across purple clouds, bathing Alinane’s already red hair in fire. She stood stunned for a moment before I grabbed her and spun her around in my arms. I sat her on her feeet and said, “Why aren’t you married, Alinane?” <br>
<br>
          She looked at me with a trembling smile and said. “Because the one I love hasn’t asked me yet.” <br>
<br>
          With that I dropped to one knee and said, “Alinane, my love, will you marry me?” <br>
<br>
          To my surprise, I heard her laugh! I looked up hurt, and she said, “It’s about time you idiot. I’d almost given up on you.” I put the golden ring on her finger. <br>
<br>
          We were married. All our friends attended, and I had never been happier. Through it all something drew Alinane’s eyes North, though she would not tell me what. <br>
<br>
          For the next year, our time was bliss. We even talked about children, though Tunare knows they would have been very large half elves! I was happier than I had ever been until one night I woke up screaming. One word consumed my mind. Valkyrie. <br>
<br>
          The next day I asked Alinane if she knew what the word meant. Her face just saddened, and she left the room without speaking. <br>
<br>
          Again and again I was called away to perform my duties, and Alinane to perform hers. On the night of our first anniversary, I felt one of the stones that Paithan had given us at our wedding grow warm around my neck. <br>
<br>
          “Come home, love. I need you,” Alinane’s voice came from the stone. <br>
<br>
          “I’m on my way,” I cried, then not even knowing why, I added “Don’t you dare leave without seeing me again.” <br>
<br>
          I raced toward our Faydark home, when passing the very spires Paithan had transported me from a year before, I saw my Alinane. <br>
<br>
          She was standing there, wearing only the clothes given her when she had started as a fledgling shaman. As I approached, I found I couldn’t talk. <br>
<br>
          She looked at me with tears in her eyes and started to speak. “The Valkyrie are warrior women of my race who serve the gods. They ferry the honored dead to the halls of Valhalla. By invoking the will of the Tribunal, I opened myself to be chosen as Valkyrie.” <br>
<br>
          “I know now that my letter would never have reached you without their aid. I owe them for a year of happiness, love. And as repayment for that priceless gift, I must now serve.” <br>
<br>
          “In their service I will live forever, and because of that, so will our love.” She then handed me her mallet. <br>
<br>
          I grabbed her and whispered into her ear, “I love you, Alinane Mapleleaf.” <br>
<br>
          “I love you too, Wunderr” <br>
<br>
          She sat down and disappeared before my eyes.<br>
<br>
          It was in me to say “the End” as a finish to my tale, but it occurred to me in the telling that there is no end. I live, and breathe. I have those I care about, and who care about me. I, Wunderr Mapleleaf, learned of love from a fiery barbarian lass. I promise, my love, the lessons will not be forgotten, nor my life wasted. <br>
<br>
...still the beginning. <br>
<br>
Wunderr Mapleleaf<br>
<br>
Knight Sage<br>
<br>
Vanguard of the Iron Crown<br>
 <br>
The Mountains of Rathe<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
We had held our position for many days. Infected Paw had come to know and dread the name of Vanguard. With the entrance cleared, our attack was driving deeper into the gnoll’s filthy stronghold.<br>
<br>
My companions and I held the path for retreat clear, while our compatriots forced the attack into the Splitpaw inner sanctums. I could hear the spells of Rizzo and Xurg echo through the tunnels. I wore a grim smile as I looked at the Vanguardians assembled with me. They were a good group, and we were well suited to our task. Standing weary and worn beside me were, Orson Stormwolf, Knight of the Council, Aliena Stormwolf, Kinght Templar, Annzabeth Havenslight, Squire, and an ally from the Avengers Federation, Valinar the Cleric.<br>
<br>
Truth be told, we were a motly looking bunch, after the days of battle, it seemed the stench of this place had seeped into our very pores. The campaign showed no sign of ending, though our supplies ran short.<br>
<br>
We were joined by a shaman, Jenaddar, when Orson announced he had to depart. Pressing matters in his circle called him away. As had happened many times in my life, I was called into command, though many of my band surpassed me in power. Fate would see that this command was short lived.<br>
<br>
Our position was secure, and we had little trouble maintaining the path clear. That is until a shout of terror erupted from the depths of Infected Paw. My fellow Vanguardian Xurg shouted the retreat, chased by no less than three of the terrible serpents that dwell in Infected Paw. At his call, my group made haste to retreat, luckily incurring no casualties in the process.<br>
<br>
Our supplies were abandoned, and our toehold on Paw was lost. My little band chose to split up, I stood looking at the entrance to Paw dejectedly. I knew that an attempt now would be suicide. The gnolls would have to be purged another day.<br>
<br>
From behind me, Annzabeth spoke, "I fancy going to the Mountains of Rathe, so with your permission. I’ll take my leave, Sir Wunderr."<br>
<br>
At the mere mention of the mountains, I brightened. I caught a glance from Lady Aliena that told me all I needed to know. Fresh air, forest, and a fight in a Ranger’s element awaited. I felt better already.<br>
<br>
"If you don’t mind the company, Annzabeth, I think I’ll trail along." I said to her with a grin.<br>
<br>
"Aye, I’ll tag along, too!" Aliena chuckled.<br>
<br>
As always seems to be the case, no trip will go smoothly if there is a possibility of something going wrong. Annzabeth nearly drowned in Lake Rathetear, but was saved by another group of adventurers. Feeling in their debt, she chose to repay them by lending her healing arts to their party. This left Aliena and I alone to tackled the monsters of the mountains.<br>
<br>
Virtually surrounded by cyclops, we scouted the area. Aliena found a cave that would suffice to protect us should things go against us, and I agreed "Aye, this looks like a good spot. This will do, Lady Aliena."<br>
<br>
She looked around and nodded, "I think so, too"<br>
<br>
"Well, I guess we’ll wait others to show, and begin our hunt." I said beginning to make our camp.<br>
<br>
Aliena got a strange look on her face and proclaimed, "Wunderr, I think we can take one by ourselves."<br>
<br>
I was stunned. Aliena was usually the voice of reason to my foolhardiness. Though technically I outranked her in the Vanguard, she was by far the better Ranger. She had appointed herself as my bodyguard, and had her hands full keeping me out of trouble. So, for her to suggest something that even I considered foolish was a complete shock!<br>
<br>
Before I could reply, she continued. "Listen, here’s my plan...." As she spoke, I saw her face flash with excitement at the thought of the coming battle. Her plan was simple, we would taunt and keep the brute confused, all the while casting our magic. When our mana was gone, we’d let him taste our blades.<br>
<br>
Aliena sat out to find a lone cyclops on which to try our plan. Before long, I heard Aliena shout, "Be ready, the brute is behind me!"<br>
<br>
With a smile, I thought to myself, "As if I couldn’t tell by the earth trembling with his every step!"<br>
<br>
As soon as I saw him I loosed a bolt of fire. He immediately swung, his huge hand grazing me, nearly knocking me off my feet. My vision hazed over with pain, but I readied my weapons and began my next spell.<br>
<br>
As the colossus reared back to hit me again, Aliena’s magic seared his skin. He immediately turned on her, but she nimbly dodged his blow. It seemed our plan would work, and I let go with another blast of fire. My stomach fell, something I had dreaded happened. My spell struck, but dissipated harmlessly, not even singeing the fiend.<br>
<br>
He swung again at Aliena, momentarily, stunning her. I jumped in blades whirling. If my magic was useless, my swords surely weren’t. I screamed in battle lust and hacked at my foe. He turned at my attack and swatted me. I withstood the crushing blow and continued to taunt and fight.<br>
<br>
My spells were only hitting one in four times, and I feared it wouldn’t be enough. The battle had been joined in earnest. Aliena’s spells found their mark and now her steel bit deep into the monster’s hide. I was taunting the beast, trying to keep his attention when my comrade made the dreaded announcement.<br>
<br>
"I’m out of mana, Wunderr!"<br>
<br>
Our steel would have to suffice, but I was weakening. My foe seemed to sense this, and pounded furiously at me. I dodged and moved. I swung my sword and axe, I kicked the brute, but I could feel my insides being broken by his blows. Even if the brute fell, I feared I would be too weak to use my remaining mana to save myself. One last blow from the cyclops landed, and I fell, dying.<br>
<br>
I cannot remember it all, but I heard a cry of rage erupt from Aliena. I managed to turn my head to see the battle. Aliena was a blur of motion. She cut the lumbering hulk ten times for every blow he landed. Amazingly, with a sick groan, he fell face forward .<br>
<br>
Aliena immediately turned to me. Cradling my head she looked at me. I was fading fast, but not so far gone as to not be surprised that this fierce warrior was crying.<br>
<br>
"I don’t have the mana to heal you."<br>
<br>
I turned my head and coughed, tasting the blood from my injuries. I turned my face toward her and tried to smile, "You were right, milady. We can take a cyclops by ourselves."<br>
<br>
She laid me down with a look of determination such as I’d never seen. Then her face relaxed and she sat next to me cross-legged. I closed my eyes and waited for the end.<br>
<br>
Aliena lept to her feet, and began to cast. I saw a bright blue through my eyelids and felt my injuries knit. It wasn’t much, but enough to let me cast. I weakly stood up, nearly falling. I tried to cast a healing spell of my own, but it fizzled. With only enough mana for one more attempt, I tried again. It worked, I was out of danger. I looked at Aliena quizzically.<br>
<br>
"But you were out of mana!"<br>
<br>
Aliena smiled at me, "I was out of mana, Wunderr. But Tunare loves you, and you have work to do."<br>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Long I had awaited the return of my friend and comrade in arms, one I had always jokingly called Lady. I was nearly stunned when I caught site of her, the Lady Marlos, who had through name and deed marked herself as warrior, though her chosen path was that of bard. Battleborne, the name mocked me, I could barely meet her eyes. Battleborne, is that what I had become? <br>
<br>
I could look at myself as a young elf as if it were an entirely different person. No longer was I, Wunderr Mapleleaf, Knight of the Vanguard, but Wunderr, veteran of bloody war and ground down by the weight I felt I bore. Did she see my heart? My friend had always been able. Was the Lady even my friend? If I had been able to cry, I would have then.. but I no longer cried. I tried to smile at Marlos, for part of me sincerely rejoiced at her return, the other dreaded what she'd find lurking in my soul. I had become hard, and I did not want her to see it.<br>
<br>
It was in that moment that I realized. Battleborne. It was Marlos' path, Mapleleaf was my name and my pride. I was confused, but I saw a way to proceed for the first time in what felt like ages. Tunare guided me still, not Zek who guided my friend. I turned from Marlos with a quick goodbye, but I knew what I needed to do, Marlos could carry on the battle, I would find the seed of Tunare inside, and nurture it. The Vanguard of the Iron Crown could carry on the fight, and I would be their ally still, but to lead was shredding my soul. <br>
<br>
Marlos had left us, and sometime after, I had lost a sense of self. As she had so many times pointed out, we were a different breed. Her return reminded me of my true duty to each soul I met. A duty I now happily perform. Dear friends, please be happy with me, Wunderr has returned.<br>
