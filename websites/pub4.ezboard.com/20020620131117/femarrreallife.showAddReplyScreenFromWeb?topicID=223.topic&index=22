<br>
  I was at a friends house, and we put salt all over this slug on his back porch. It got all gross and turned inside out and shit. I scraped it up with a stick and flung it. Fucking thing went RIGHT into my friends mouth. He immedietly started puking, as did his girl friend. I tried holding back but the sight of those two gagging and hurling all over his back porch made me blow my chunks too.<br>
<br>
Now for stupid shit I've done...<br>
<br>
I was at work, I work at an Elks lodge, if any of you know what that is.  A bar, kitcken, huge hall and shit. It's a non-profit membership club, mostly older dudes hang out here. Anyways there was this event called &quot;Poor man's night&quot; where beers are $1 and a band was playing. Steve Smith and the Nakeds, some of you mighta heard of them. My job was to keep these huge buckets full of beer (cans) and ice. Me and another dude had to lug 30 packs from the outdoor walk in fridge on the other side of the lodge, (it's a huge place out in the woods) to the indoor walk in fridge. When we would stock up the buckets with beer, we would leave one in the box and take it back into the kitchen. When they would pile up we would go outside to throw them out, and chug down the beers. The roady from the band was some crazy dude with dread locks, piercings all over his face, and an open beer in each hand. We talked with him and chugged our beers, I lost count after 12. I had drank them so fast that at first I seemed ok, but once they started kicking in I was fucked. The bartender handed me the ice bucket to go fetch him ice for behind the bar. I took the bucket and puked in it. And all over the floor and myself. Right in front of everybody. I went out to the loading dock and hurled for a good 10 minutes. The guys out there were laughing and cheering me on. I could no longer stand up, I fell on the floor and began rolling around. Thats about all I remember, I woke up the next morning still half drunk and feeling like dog shit, worst hang over I have ever had.<br>
<br>
<br>
I stuck my finger in a lobster claw...my father told me to do it, it was a big son of a bitch too, 5 lbs. Don't ever do it.<br>
<br>
I turned down a blow job.<br>
<br>
I put salutes (you know those small fire crackers) in a sunfish's mouth. It fit's perfect. Light that sucker up and blew it's head off.<br>
<br>
I made a lvl 1 high elf cleric, got a skin like nature and a sow from a druid friend of mine. I went to crushbone and did a couple laps around the zone picking up every single mob. I kept on going until finally after killing quite a few people I lagged out and they caught up and kicked my ass.<br>
<br>
I stuck my tounge to a railing in december...tore all the skin off it bled for a while and hurt like a son of a bitch.<br>
<br>
I was drinking with some friends, and ended up spending the night at his house. His room is in the cellar, and he has a couch that I usually sleep on. I was pretty cocked, and I passed out shortly after sitting down. Maybe an hour or two later the pain in my bladder from having to piss so bad woke me up. I had already partially pissed the bed but I still had to go. Not wanting to wake up his parents by drunkenly stumbling up the stairs in the dark, I had the bright idea of pissing in his dehumidifier. I let it rip but my aim was off, I was hitting the wall. I aimed down a tad but it hit the side and splashed all over my legs. By the time I had my stream going in the right spot, I was nearly done going! My shorts were soaked, so I had to take them off and sleep naked. Since I didn't plan on spending the night, I didn't have a change of clothes. The next day I had to free ball it in a pair of jeans..it really sucked since they were pretty new and hadn't been broken in yet so they were rough as hell. My friend was pissed when he found out I pissed all over his dehumidifier and wall, but I didn't tell him I pissed on his couch too.<br>
<br>
Sorry I have to cut it short here, I fell asleep at  my comp and just woke up. goodbye<br>

I went up to a friend of mine's college and we had a little dorm room party.  As soon as i get there (around 7pm) i start drinking.  I drank 12 shots of vodka in a row and then chuged a smirnoff.  20 minutes later a bunch of other kids show up and my friend (great friend he is) said i had only taken 2 shots and that i was a pussy.  So making me look like an ass i took the bottle of liqour and started chugging.  At about 10pm i totally pass out cold on the couch.  I remember trying to breathe because it sure as hell wasn't involuntary anymore and then i remember nothing.  Well i wake up with cocks drawn on me , a mustash, an olive in my ear and a post it pad with a phone number on it.<br>
<br>
After i come out of it (12 hours later) i asked my friend wtf happened and he said 2 freshmen girls were sitting on my lap wanting to have a threesome.  At this point i took the garbage and puked because the hang over was so bad and because i missed out on the best thing that could ever happen in my life.  Hey.. at least i got one of the girl's phone # so it wasn't all that bad.<br>
<br>
The following day i drank a bottle of water had a piece of bread and a bottle of fruitopia.  This lasted about 20 minutes before i started to projectile puke and fountain puke the fruitopia.  My friend was eating a meatball grinder at the time so i made him puke too.  The fucker deserved it! <p>Pankeleonn.  Putting the "Man" in "Mancheese"
