<br>
Are you able to read and comprehend English? Doesnt seem that way. <br>
<br>
I asked for Wammbaamm to be in the random and was told she would be, until I arrived and you decided the raid was FOR someone in particular and there would be no random. So  I left.<br>
<br>
You also have the facts wrong concerning Thisosa. On this first King raid with you, she didnt win random on king. The &quot;rogue with out lock pick skills&quot;  incident didnt involve me, you must be confused. <br>
<br>
The raid which you asked my rogue to come to was when I made the deal with you for Thisosa. Unfortunately every time you were in Chardok after that you refused to make good on your promise.<br>
<br>
Now when you asked Wammbaamm, my enc, to help I asked if she would be in the random and was told she would be, until I arrived and you decided the raid was FOR someone in particular and there would be no random. So I decided to leave, and at that time let you know i was very disappointed in you. You and Ironlute responded with threats, name calling and finally a promise to checlk the logs.<br>
<br>
Since then I've written you both off. But when I read the lies about Chamcham and Barrrymore, I felt people would like to know just what kind of people you are. <br>
<br>
Hope you can sleep at night. <br>

Ive only added facts.  Changed would have been that I said that I didnt random, then I did.  And you still get tells about it?  Well great for you, Im sure the highlight of your day is something that happened 6 months ago.  People would have left because I didnt give you a robe?  What a bunch of loyalty there to a guild.  I'd be glad to get rid of them and thats a damn quick way to do it lol.  And so what if people told you good for sticking up (glad you stuck up to whine about it)... I got tells not to give it to you.  And Iron, has always given out the pendant when in need, theres no reason to wear it, its a click buff.<br>
<br>
You still have done nothing to prove that theres something wrong here.  All you are is one pissed off gnome about a robe.  If you based a persons character off one event you choose one that suits your current hatred for me making the EH split happen.  If I was a better person, Id judge it by an event that you know is more inline with myself.  That would be being so depressed that Barrymore has never been upgraded, then being handed VS staff in the Bazaar.  I got a ton of thanks from you then.  But alas!  No amount of good actions can outdo you if something doesnt go your way.  <br>
<br>
Birren, you constantly complained about what items you want, and fought with another MT in the guild.  In fact, the day you left you had abandoned a quick raid to kill Harla Dar because we wouldnt pull the Valley Dragons for you to get a chance to get a dragon shoulder.  You were given the chance to either come back or leave the guild.  Where does that put you?  And before you say anything about faction, Harla Dar drops faction on the same level as Woushi which is negligible, the dragons you want drop a half level each... and this was said at the raid.  Besides, you got your set of SS armor because I trusted you, well too much so to see you walk away very soon later.<br>
<br>
Kelewala, whine more about not getting loot somewhere else lol.  Really, I'm just sick of &quot;Raid was for me, loot was for me, I didnt get my way... wah mommy wah&quot;.  <br>
<br>
Maybe I should complain about loot and request your items back that you agreed too.  If you didnt, wouldnt that make you a thief.<br>

I did and still do want it to be a successful guild.  I think there are some things you are missing and its going to tear RE apart if its not addressed and fixed.<br>
<br>
Gorn, do you not listen?  I didnt really care about the shoulders, only reason i brought it up was i figured, &quot;if we're gonna take a faction hit, lets take a faction hit&quot;.  I left because you wouldnt @#%$ listen to me about the faction issue.  <br>
<br>
I did not complain about loot all the time.  Only time i complained about not killing a mob was when we were right next to Maestro in Hate, and Iron was insisting on killing Velk.... didnt make much sense to me... and that was the only reason i brought it up.  <br>
<br>
When i expressed my concern, you should not have brushed me off.  You should not have told me to STFU.  that is, if you wanted me, and the SS armor on me to stay.  Up until the point you told me to STFU i had no intention of leaving the guild.  It was YOU and Ironlute that caused me to leave.  You were right to trust me with the armor.  But when you start pulling this BS, you cannot expect anyone to stay, especially after you insult them the way you did me in guild chat.  <br>
<br>
You keep bringing up this other MA thing.  Yes, there was a disagreement, those happen, welcome to life gorn.  But it hasnt been an issue for well over 2 months.  <br>
<br>
The reason i left was not because i didnt get loot.  A small part of it had to do with the way some loot was handled (loot totally unrelated to me btw, so you cant call me a loot whore on that one), but over all the way you,.... nm the way Iron runs your guild.  And they way you addressed valid concerns brought up by one of your guild members, that was shared by others, tho they did not speak up (i recieved two tells to this effect, no i didnt take any SSs was too flustered about being chased out of the guild).<br>
<br>
What gets me on top of all this, the night i deguilded, i recieved no /tells from you at all before or after.  After i recieved one from Iron asking for the guild owned equipmenti had.  i told her i had none.  She said what about the UP weapons?  My response: What UP weapons?  The ones that would be No drop if i had them?  Way to @#%$ know how to gear your MTs/guild.  All she was concerned with was loot, not trying to work the issue out.... real nice and classy....<br>
<br>
Gorn, you are teh best raid leader i have ever seen.  But your methods of running a guild are lacking, as pointed out by numerous people, all pointing to the same issues.  I could see it if it was a few isolated incidents.  But you have many many people (reputable people for the most part) all saying the same thing.  That should give you pause to stop and think that maybe, even if some of what the say is wrong, just maybe there might be a grain of truth in something they are saying.<br>
<br>
I hope RE can be successful, but atm, i know of several people considering leaving... that should give you pause as well.  It does not look to me like RE will last at its current str much longer. And that saddens me.<br>
<br>
You can say that i left because of loot, becuase at the surface it looks that way, but wtf would i leave a guild that i got a full suit of SS in, over a shoulder peice that can be bought.  I am not stupid, and that would be a stupid thing to do especially if i was a &quot;loot whore&quot;.  <br>
<br>
Something i have noticed through this thread you have not denied with any sort of proof several of the accusations made.  Whether you chose to do this, or whether you have no proof, it does not look good for you Gorn.  If you have no proof, that to should give you pause to stop and think.<br>
<br>
Several people here have given multiple examples of what we are talking about, all indicating the same thing.  This should also give you pause.  <br>
<br>
There is definately something wrong Gorn, i dont think even you can deny that.  <br>
<br>
I think the best thing for RE would be for you to step down as the leader (not as a raid leader, you are the best at that) and let someone else handle guild issues while you handle raids.  But that is just my opinion and almost certainly wont happen.  <br>
<br>
I really hate to see all the work so many people have put into RE be for nothing if it implodes like it is looking to me atm. <br>

We planned on doing Velketor but didnt have clerics.  I called the few groups we had to quickly kill Magi in Hate to get Athao his staff.  You had close to nothing completed on epic, and we only had about an hour and a half to kill velk before others had to log.  <br>
<br>
You fail to realize that loot has *always* been decided by more than just one person.  We should I *force* the guild to automatically drop from ally to get at chance at some shoulders (and then negate the armor drops we got in tov that day)?  The targets I pick are specifically to enchance the guild in the best way possible.  Killing non Myga ph dragons, or killing Myga ph dragons when we wont be around to get the spawn is a waste of hours of farming in Kael.<br>
<br>
Truth be told you were always bragging on how many hp you had, you were always complaining about your next upgrade, and you really pissed me off by complaining about and then leaving a raid over some dumb shoulders.  I had multiple complaints about you and so I gave you the choice.<br>
<br>
If you think that ever decision I make is influence by Ironlute you are very naive.  The only quarrel that you actually brought up was the Robe which were the MEMBERS of RE that thought that Iron should get it (because the robe is extermely, extermely rare), and in which I (only officer at time) totaly stayed out of guild.  <br>
<br>
There is a lot more work that any officer does then most members can actually realize.  Because you are unhappy with my decision to have you leave means nothing.  In the real world, managers lay off people every moment.  <br>
<br>
People that accuse others of doing something are the ones in burden of bringing out the facts.  If I say that I saw you having sexual intercourse with zoo animals you are going to say show me.  If I dont bring the proof then its dismiss.  Remember, we are innocent until proven guilty.  Therefore, anyone believing someone that doesnt have hardcore evidence is being quite naive.  <br>
<br>
And finally, Ironlute is an officer, if I do not take into account my officers suggestions then what good are they?<br>

But dont ignore the other points i have brought up Gorn.  <br>
<br>
And yes, i admit i bragged that I, a haffer in non ntov gear had over 4k unbuffed hps, more than the ogres and trolls in the guild.  So sue me.  Not like others /caugh Iron, didnt brag as about their highlights as well....  But i didnt do it on a daily basis /caugh Iron...<br>
<br>
something is wrong gorn, fix it before it kills RE.<br>
<br>
I refrained from posting all this for so long because i thought it would do RE more harm than hurt, but it got to the point where Gorn/Iron were spewing too many &quot;exagerations&quot;(at best).  If you guys really want whats best for RE, you wouldnt brush off what so many people are telling you.  <br>
<br>
Good luck.  (not sarcastic) <p><a href='http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=248327'>Birren Anklebiter</a><BR>

Seriously.  Birren, if you have issues you wish to discuss with gorn and the officers, try to set up a meeting with them and work it out..Putting in on R and F, where every word you say can be twisted and broken into 1000 different meanings is not the way to go.  To others who have issues with Gorn and Iron, I would recommend taking it to tells also.  Cham went waaaay too far in the post over a game.  Cham, go outside, enjoy sunlight a little bit...careful, you'll peel.  Stirx is right, the day we get so worked up over a game is when we need to reassess our own lives.<br>

What @#%$ up logic that is...<br>
<br>
PersonA has a bad day and says @#%$ you - you say PersonA is the worst scum on the face of the earth...<br>

PersonA then sees you and goes out of thier way to find your corpse res you and generally make your day better - what are they now angels?<br>

You can't judge anyone or any guild or anything in life over individual events.<br>

Perhaps you have me confused with yourself - I don't know - I only posted once on a guild specific board about an incident with KX - I never judged thier entire guild nor did I go spamming all over the place - the post was about a member of the guild whos message board I posted on, and once the guild leader saw the post - I deleted the post.  Nor did I lie - I'm sorry if you are insecure about being in a guild who has tried to bully past not only ring of destiny - but affliction into NToV - but if that's what makes you happy then go for it.<br>
<br>
I have friends in KX - and those of you who don't give a @#%$ about the other people in game - frankly can go @#%$ yourselves - it doesn't make everyone in your guild a gimp.<br>
