<br>
  What I want to know is when, exactly, did we become a spanish speaking nation. The US that is. Cuz, like, I think I missed it.<br>
<br>
  I'm almost certain San Diego is still in the US right? Mexico didn't annex it when we weren't looking did it?<br>
<br>
  So why the hell do I spend 75% of my work day (in retail, blech) calling over the intercom for someone to come translate the spanish gibberish from some moron who lives, shops, and works in an english speaking nation, spends money from said nation (and knows how much it's worth), but refuses to learn the @#%$ language.<br>
<br>
  Now, I don't have anything against mexicans as a race. As long as when they move to an english speaking country, they learn the damn language. If I was going to move to mexico, I'd learn spanish. Hell, if I was going to just visit there (although why I'd want to do that I can't imagine) I'd make an effort to learn at least enough of the language to, say, buy a pair of shoes or a shirt.<br>
<br>
  And what REALLY annoys me no end... ESL classes.<br>
<br>
  ... WTF is up with THAT... doing my college assessment tests last week, the instructor/test giver/whatever announced that there was an ESL version of the test available for those who needed it.<br>
<br>
  The test in question being the two part ENGLISH test...<br>
<br>
  Seriously, I am no great communicator... and reading this, I'm sure you can tell that my writing skills are nowhere close to what they SHOULD be... and yet I came very close to aceing both the english tests... missed 3 questions total (2 on the &quot;writing&quot; test and 1 on the &quot;reading&quot; test).<br>
<br>
  WTH is wrong with this picture here folks? Those tests were so damn easy that I actually managed to finish a book (not a thick one, only about 280 pages) in the leftover bits of time after I completed the tests.<br>
<br>
  And these were the tests for native speakers... I can only imagine that the ESL tests would be easier... hard as it is to imagine anything easier.<br>
<br>
  (btw for the curious I tanked HARD on the math test heh... 50% blech... I need to work on my math)<br>
<br>
  Bah. I'm gonna go to sleep now that I've pissed off every native speaker of spanish that reads this.<br>
<br>
  Course, in order to read this, they kinda gotta speak english heh... <p><center><A HREF="http://www.clanautumnwood.com" TARGET="_top">

I hate to break it to ya bub... The U.S. does not have a declared national language.  But don't worry.  Ignorance like yours will eventually push the rest of the world to learn english in order to take our money.<br>
<br>
I'll agree with ya though.  It can be annoying, but it's not that big of a problem.  Quit jo whining foo.<br>

What I think it is is more localized feelings with a disregard to the bigger picture because it does not effect the person making the statement.<br>
<br>
Nobody declares a national language anywhere. Society dictates what language is most common to that particular country. At some point most people feel the need to conform to that norm to make things easier but it doesn't always happen.<br>
<br>
I am however a strong supporter of the fact that people should abide by the laws of the country in which they choose to live and should make every attempt to integrate themselves as part of their country. Speaking the language is part of that integration.<br>
<br>
You have a problem over there in that people move out of Mexico and South America to avoid poverty. Each and every day hundreds of people are attempting to live in America, work in America, and live an American life whilst recognizing their own roots. What you also have is people who come to America, to abuse the system with no intention of ever wanting to have anything really to do with the country.<br>
<br>
What Kulani is missing is that there are probably lots of people she knows who are hispanic but she doesn't see them that way because they are in fact trying. <p><CENTER><A HREF="http://ak.lonelygamer.com">

I'm serious.  That's perhaps the best way to ease your problem, Kulani.<br>
<br>
I'm a Los Angeles native so I know where you're coming from, but I'm also a first generation immigrant from Taiwan, so I also know how it's like on the flip side.  Languages are tough as hell to learn, so people of similar ethnic and cultural backgrounds band together to give each other a sense of familiarity.  There can be a number of reasons as to why the Latinos aren't making the shift over to English.  1.) It's very hard to learn a new trade, skill, and language after the age of 25.  2.) They do not have the time and money to sit down to learn a new language; they're too busy working minimum wage to get by to dedicate the time that's needed to become fluent in a new language. 3.) Language = culture, and they're still clinging to their heritage.<br>
<br>
Another way to look at it is this.  Language = culture.  When you enter a middle upper class family's home, you don't go off in ebonics if you want to make the best impression.  But, if you want to be down with the homeyz in the hood, you're not going to be using complete sentences and you'll be using a lot of double negatives.  As long as the culture survives, so will the language.  And, especially in the southwestern states, the Mexican culture is alive and firmly rooted.  Embrace it!  Go out on Cinco de Mayo, visit the cultural museums, have some fun on the Day of the Dead, eat some *real* tamales and tacos.  Sure, you have to deal with non English speaking Mexicans, but you know what?  That's what comes with the turf of expanding cultural awareness.<br>
<br>
The best way to remedy the problem is to take the first step of initiative and learn some Spanish.  I know that tactic worked for me working in a produce market.  I made friends with the Hispanics and asked if I could practice my Spanish on them.  They ended up getting sharing their beers with me, teaching me how to down tequila like an amigo, taught me how to say &quot;fag&quot; and &quot;dyke&quot; in Spanish, and I learned some real Spanish.  None of that &quot;mi llamo es Alicia, como estas? muy bien, gracias, y tu?  ah, mas o menos&quot; crap.<br>
<br>
You remember when you said that if you lived in Mexico, you'd learn Spanish?  Well, in a sense, Kulani, you're living in mini-Mexico.  SoCal has an enormous population of Latinos.  I remember reading a survey that stated L.A. has the second largest population of Hispanics (Mexican Hispanics, I think) outside of Mexico City.  So, the best solution is to brush up that Espanol.  You know what, though?  You get some MAJOR kudo points for being bilingual when you apply for jobs.  I was able to beat people out when lobbying for a job down there because I'm fluently bilingual in English and Chinese, and I speak elementary Spanish.  Aside from languages, I wasn't as qualified as the other people vying for the job and rather inexperienced.  But employers *need* bilingual and trilingual people down there.  Make the locale work for you in your favor.<br>
<br>
I know how frustrated it can get, but there's just so many factors which themselves are very, very valid reasons that can affect why an immigrant isn't fluent in English.<br>
<br>
Y'all are damn lucky down there.  I'm in Seattle now and I can't blame foreigners for idiocy because some of the still can't read but they were born citizens.  And I've yet to find a decent taco up here. <p><img src="http://ourworld.cs.com/nimue321/aish.jpg">

Now on the other hand... if they want a higher chance of being successful in the U.S. then they would have to learn English.  <br>
<br>
The culture thing is a very very big deal.  Alot of people continue to speak there native language in the house to maintain this culture and this sets up barriers to learn otherwise.  <br>

The majority of the US seems to speak english, yay. How did the United States come to be, anyway? We were a nation comprised of emmigrants that kicked the natives out. ( Sadly )<br>
<br>
We don't have an original language, everything we have is pretty much taken from other countries. Now, the English may have been the very first to stumble upon here, however what gives the english language seniority? We were here first?<br>

I am tired of always getting a choice of English or Spanish on every phone call, atm or wall of forms I use.  If we are so liberal minded and are such a melting pot that people want to defend it's regular use, then fine I'll not complain one bit as long we are an equal opportunity country to ALL Languages...  <br>
<br>
I want phone calls to give me a choice of every major language in the world.  I want to see every stack of forms you fill out to have a WALL full of choices of languages so that ANYONE that speaks a foreign language may have the same opportunity that Spanish and English have.   Humm how does that sound?<br>
<br>
Either be a melting pot of languages because we have everyone major language represented in this country or be all English.  One or the other folks.  I think it's prejudice to have just Spanish represented... where's French, Dutch, German, Gaelic, Italian, Russian, Japanese, Swahili.... .   All or nothing would be the fair thing.  Now see how silly it would be to spend 5 hours on the phone just trying to pick with language you wanted?<br>
<br>
France is a French speaking country. Germany is a German speaking country. The Neitherlands is a Dutch speaking country. Russia is a Russian speaking country. American is an English speaking country   ...etc.  Even if those countries have many that speak English.  They have a recognized language that is theirs. If you move to ANY country it is your obligation to learn the language of the country you move to.  If one is so wrapped up in their language and culture that they can not bring themselves to mesh into the country they move to, they do not need to be there.  I'd never do that if I moved to another country.  I'd read about their culture, respect it, live by it to the best of my ability and learn the language.  It's the right thing to do no matter what your race or cultural background is.  It's not a racial issue; it's a respect issue.  imo.  Respect that country you visit or live in by learning about it and embracing what they are.<br>

Yes, Germany is a German-speaking country.  I lived there for four years (as an American military dependent, in high school) and I cannot recall even one occasion when I was unable to find someone who spoke English (when I needed it; I do have some walking-around German and Spanish ability).  They teach English in German secondary schools, and it's not an elective.<br>
<br>
During the Olympics in Lillehammer, Norway, I watched a TV news crew visit the town a few months prior to the Games and talk to the residents about what they thought the experience would mean for their (small) mountain village.  ALL of them spoke English, including the preschool kids who were interviewed.<br>
<br>
Closer to home, here in EQ, my guild has members from Hong Kong, Denmark, Germany, Singapore, and probably ten or so other nations where English isn't the primary language -- ALL of them communicate very effectively in English in guildchat.  I'd also point to Oggy and Pyrastilia as non-native-English speakers who are fluent in the language.<br>
<br>
As Americans we (in general, there are of course exceptions) travel and expect that everywhere we go we will be accommodated in English.  Get on a Liberian-registered cruise ship sometime -- often with a crew composed primarily of Indonesian, Thai, or Filipino citizens, and a captain from Scandinavia or Western Europe -- EVERYONE speaks English.  Visit a five-star hotel in any city anywhere in the world -- the concierge and desk clerks, at a minimum, will speak English.  The international language of air travel is English -- all pilots and air traffic controllers are expected to speak it, to minimize confusion.<br>
<br>
I suppose this cuts both ways -- people from all over the world manage to learn English (often better, and often a LOT better, than native-born Americans) -- so it doesn't seem unreasonable to expect that people who move to the United States will also learn English.  At the same time, as we Americans visit other countries and find (as if by magic) that there is almost always someone who speaks English when we need it, it never occurs to us that we COULD have learned THEIR language as well.<br>
<br>
I don't know that there's a great answer.  This is a classic liberal/conservative &quot;hot button&quot; issue -- &quot;they move here, make 'em speak OUR language&quot; -- &quot;no, no -- it's their cultural heritage and it is we who are being bigoted.&quot;  However, the thought did occur to me as I read Kulani's post that, from an economic perspective, the best solution wouldn't be to expect all of the retail store's customers to learn English -- it would be to transfer Kulani and put someone in her position who is bilingual, and so can furnish prompt customer service.  If I were the employer and learned that I had an employee who spent 75% of their working hours doing something which didn't bring a penny into my business, I'd reallocate my resources.<br>

Bad business?  Not as bad as not learning the language of the country you live in.<br>
<br>
English isn't the US language?  Anyone you ask would tell you it was if they didn't stop to think about it, or view it as a trick question.  Official or not, our language is english.<br>
<br>
I visited mexico with my limited 4 years of highschool spanish.  I didn't know much but in their culture hearing spanish all day I remembered what little I had learned.  I sounded stupid, but I tried.  <br>

In america, I am going to speak english.  If you come here and you don't learn english, you are ungrateful.  We are good enough to offer opportunity, but not good enough to associate with. Whatever. <p><img src=http://www.mindspring.com/~cnjmorris/catcen.jpg>

Of course, you could drag this back even further and say that everyone should have learned whatever Native American languages were prevalent in the area. . . .<br>

I'm pretty sure that the US DOES have an official language.. and that it IS English.  It's not just the southwest either, Florida is almost as bad.  <br>
<br>
I work for a credit card company that has a location in Florida, and we CONSTANTLY get calls from employees there who cant speak intelligible English.  A few times a day someone from there will call me to verify a monetary file to be sent out (often in the millions of dollars).  So I'm responsible for sending a few million up to the National Reserve and the person who gives me the file information cant speak English.. I see a definite problem with this.  <br>
<br>
I too learned some Spanish in high school (not fluent by any means, but I could survive till I learned more).  Why is it too much to ask those who come here to do the same?  English isn't an easy language to learn, but people do it every day.  If you want to be in this country and live off its bounty, then be a contributor and not just a taker.  The best way to do this is integration.  Get your education, and be a productive member of society (pretty damn hard when you dont speak the language). <p><a href="http://members.aol.com/wvvetteman/images/dalonhorse1.jpg" target="_blank">

Spanish is a Romance language and has a classically regular syntax, like its Latin parent. English, on the other hand, is a Germanic language, and is ridden with grammatical exceptions, illogical structures and irregular verbs. In other words, it's much harder to learn.<br>
<br>
Secondly, I hate to break it you, but California was Spanish long before it was American, as was most of the Southwest. Spain crossed this land long before Daniel Boone found a use for raccoons.<br>
<br>
Those Mexican folk you may share a neighborhood with may have lived in your area since the 17th century while your ancestors were still fleeing the Reformation, clutching their Bibles and holding onto their buckled hats.<br>
<br>
I wonder how you'd survive in a truly cosmopolitan place Kulani, like say Melbourne, Australia or Toronto, Canada, let alone the polyglot nations like India or South Africa.<br>

English is no longer an &quot;official language&quot;; it is a lingua franca, much like Greek or Latin were circa 200AD.  <p><div align="center"><a href="http://www.ulujain.org">

<br>
i am 3rd/4th generation on my mothers side.  about half of my great grandparents generation where born in Italy.  but i almost never heard my grand parents talk italian.  and my mom knows almost no italian at all.  and i've heard this from other italians.  the generation that came over here demanded that the kids learn english.  they didn't loose any of their other culture, but learned the language at least.<br>
<br>
now a few weeks back i was talking to some one who is of mexican decent.  not sure how many generations she is, but that is kinda irelevent.  she said her grand mother wouldn't have them speak anything but spanish.  why would one set of people react so differently than another about the same thing?  i suspect it is primarily a fear factor.  being afraid of looseing a &quot;cultural&quot; identity.<br>
<br>
and as for them not haveing time to learn the language because they are working a minimum wage job.  i would say that they are working a minimum wage job because they don't speak the language.  and come on.  for a few bucks you can pick up a spanish to english dictionary and start to learn.  an actual english text book style book you should be able to get for about 20 bucks.  it is just a matter that they can't be bothered to learn.<br>
<br>
i just moved down to texas from northern new york.  kinda funny how i never ran into anybody who didn't speak english up there.  and i had meet people who were relatively new to the country even.  but it seems that people in texas can't be bothered.   &lt;shrug&gt;<br>

<br>
Florida im willing to bet there are large Cuban/puerto rican communities becuase florida is only 90 miles from those countries. The coastline of california has many asian communities and whatnot. <br>

Perhaps you found so many english speaking only people in upper New York becuase when the english settled the US a large portion settled new york and its fertile farmlands.<br>

There is nothing wrong with this in fact i think its one of the reasons why i love this country so much.<br>
