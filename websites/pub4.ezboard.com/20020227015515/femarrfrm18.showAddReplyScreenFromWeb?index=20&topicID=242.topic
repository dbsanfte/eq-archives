You painted all non-christians posting in this thread as "bigots".<br>
<br>
Also, I am not personally attacking you or Cendan and I think you are reading hostility where there is none. :) Indeed, what I stated early was that Cendan is in denial about the history of Christianity or he knows nothing about it. I fail to see that as a personal attack. Cendan, if your feelings got hurt accept my apology.<br>
<br>
I did answer your questions Arikel. Further, in answer to your questions regarding painting all Christians with the same historical brush that just was not done. Again the original premise was that Christians and Muslims (not all of them!) have used their holy books to defend killing in the name of god. I am not "holding" anyone responsible for the history of Christianity, Islam, or Judaism. The scathing remarks are concerning those who would use the name of their god to murder. And, if you want an example of modern Christians invoking the name of god to help them kill just listen to them pray for god's help in killing the Taliban. I heard GW Bush pray such a prayer on national television.<br>
<br>
Let me repeat so you are not confused any longer...<br>
<br>
I am NOT accusing ALL Christians or Muslims of killing in the name of their god; neither am I holding them ALL responsible. However, I will press the point that people in ALL monotheistic religions commited atrocities in their histories and some continue to do so to this day. Really, what do you think happened in Jerusalem this weekend, Arikel? <p>Lurikeen Mali'Kyre<BR>

You can't face the bloody history of Christianity. Cendan, enjoy the dream.&quot;<br>
<br>
I think that qualifies as a personal attack.  I dunno, maybe you don't read it as such.  Note that Cendan and Solathan say essentially the same thing about their respective faiths, yet you seem to feel the need to single Cendan out.  What makes Christianity and Islam so different that you feel the need to treat Christians like ignorant bumpkins when their enterpretation of their faith conflicts with your own?<br>
<br>
As for this pot and kettle business, I pointed out that there is a lot of bigotry in this thread and on this forum and that it is not coming from Christians.  In no way did I state or imply that all non-Christians on this thread are bigoted.  I admit after thinking about it that there are a couple Christian posters to this forum who are showing bigotry toward others as well; however, that certainly seems to me to be the exception to the rule. <p>Ahry - hero of Gaoth an Iar, Percival server <BR>

We're reading in two different contexts.

For example, statements like &quot;Christians do this&quot; or &quot;Muslims do that&quot; are obviously not referring to some minority or some group in the past.  Solathan and Cendan post in defense of their faiths.  Your attack on Cendan's post sure looks to me like you're supporting those generalizations made by others earlier in the thread.

First, I am not singling out Cendan. Second, I said that I was not personally attacking you or Cendan. You seem to want to refuse to accept that.

The lack of understanding going on Arikel seems to surround your insistence on not accepting my clarifications. Didn't I write that I was not saying ALL Christians? Didn't I? What part of &quot;not ALL&quot; is unlcear to you? <br>

You will be thankfull to know Arikel that I will not be responding to anymore of your posts. The height of irrationality is when one refuses to hear (read) and accept what another is saying. Arikel, you are displaying such a behavior. <p>Lurikeen Mali'Kyre<BR>

<br>
That was a reference to Muzaak's and Brutas222's posts, not to yours.  Note the chronological order in that post... I refer to Muzaak and Brutas222, then to Solathan and Cendan, and then to you.  Sorry I wasn't more clear, I was reviewing the thread in chronological order rather than making random statements about it's content.  Let me clarify my last post:<br>
<br>
1)  Brutas and Muzaak make sweeping generalizations about a couple different groups.<br>
<br>
2)  Solathan posts in defense of his faith.<br>
<br>
3)  Cendan posts in defense of his faith.<br>
<br>
4)  You post attacking Cendan's defense of his faith.<br>
<br>
What I'm trying to say here is that looking at the entire thread as a whole, you appear to be backing up Muzaak's generalizations about Christians and then trying to cover your ass when criticized for it.  After rereading the entire thread and your responses, I can see that your posts might not have anything to do with Muzaak's and simply be attacking Cendan's statements as individual arguements.  If that is the case, my implication that you are a bigot was unfounded and I'm sorry.  I stand by my statement that there is an apalling level of bigotry on this forum and in this thread, but I'm willing to take you on your word that you're not part of that. <p>Ahry - hero of Gaoth an Iar, Percival server <BR>

I can face the History.  Once again I point out that the people who are responsible for the Spanish Inquisition were not Christians so they are not a part of a Christians history, but if you would like to actually show me an example of a REAL Christian (belief in baptism for remission of sins is essential- don't give me examples of Catholics).<br>
<br>

<br>
Considering you know nothing about me I wonder to whom I am compared.<br>
<br>
<b>Arikel says:</b><br>
<font color=yellow>I'm seeing bigotry all over this thread and this forum, and it's not coming from Christians.  </font color><br>
<br>
<b>To which you respond:</b><br>
<font color=yellow>Arikel, choose which one you want to be: Pot or Kettle? You painted all non-christians posting in this thread as "bigots".  </font color><br>
<br>
I find that interesting since you put words in his mouth, and then throw your words in his face.<br>
<br>
<font color=yellow>I also expected to read from those like Arikel and Cendan who want to quote the Bible as the authoritative word of god, but then pick and choose what is authoratative! Cendan go back to the Old Testament and read where Yahweh (God, YOUR god) commands the Hebrews to kill entire peoples, women and children... right down to their livestock! Now did your god command that or didn't he? If he did what kind of monster would have commanded as much?! The god of the Old Testament makes Hitler look like a choir boy. </font color><br>
<br>
Please tell me where I pick and choose.  Didn't think so.  I am aware of what God commanded in the Old Testament.  You don't like it?  God made you and doesn't need to care whether you approve (RE-READ THAT, I didn't say He doesn't, because I don't speak where He has not).  You think that God killing people is cruel?  God defined life, God defined good and bad, He is our reference.  Life is not ours to take, it is God's, and yes - He did on occasion give permission to people, for his purpose.<br>
<br>
<font color=yellow>Cendan, if your feelings got hurt accept my apology.</font color><br>

Your attitude towards Christianity, and God, does not insult me.  I will let you take it up with Him, He doesn't need me to defend Him. <p><font color=green><b>Cendan Tankenpriest</b></font color><br>

Thanks for the admission that your god did in fact command the Hebrews to kill entire peoples, women and children included. You basically just justified alleged monstrous acts recorded in the Old Testament of your bible with an 'oh, well God created, he doesn't have to explain fucking shit to the likes of us'. I value life much more than your god does.<br>
<br>
BTW, the &quot;Didn't think so&quot; bit in your response was a bit idiotic. I would understand your statment if this was real time chat, but on a message board? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>Lurikeen Mali'Kyre<BR>

I did that for you.  You like to make things up as you go along and put words in people's mouths.  I just wanted to cut you off and save you some time and embarassment.  Of course, you had to make fun of it because in fact I do accept the Old Testament, and your previous assumptions made your intelligence questionable.  An attempt at making you look smarter and drawing attention away from your conclusions about me has only made you look more and more like you really have nothing to say that doesnt in some way just make you look, and I tried to avoid this word, stupid.  Lets change stupid to ignorant just to be nice, cause ignorance is just lack of knowledge, don't want to get into a discussion on your lack of actual intelligence so lets stick with "ignorant."<br>
<br>
Now, as to your comments on God.  You value life huh?  Define life?  Is life a body or is it a spirit.  You will say both and infer that spirit is personality and not actual "spirit" and it comes from phyical make up.  That's fine, I am sure you will be enlightened in your upcoming conversation with God.  <br>
<br>
Regardless, despite your similarity to children who say "I didn't ask to be born" when they don't get what they want, God did make you.  He defined life.  If he wants to take it away then so be it.  You are athiest right? So why do you care about life.  IF this is all there is then jump in front of a bus and have it done with.  Never have to work again, never have to worry.  You will probably say you enjoy life so you will get what you can out of it.  Well if this is all there is.. you won't miss it when you are dead... and even more... you won't remember all the "happy" memories you store up.<br>
<br>
I think most people have heard the phrase "I brought you into this world, I can take you out" and we cringe.  We think that is wrong.  Well in the Old Testament God says that (no it is not a quote) but the difference is that HE has a right.. because he TRULY did bring you into the world.  You don't have to like it.  Thats just how it is.  You can raise your fist, and you can shout at God for doing that... but in the end God is God, and he doesn't need our approval.<br>
<br>
The problem is that man, who can't even explain where he came from, why he is here, or where he is going... thinks that they are the supreme being.  To admit there is a God goes against "logic" and our assumption that there is no being greater than man.  <br>
<br>
Once again, though, I am off track.  Despite what you want to believe, the Christian way makes sense.  I will sumarize with this.  People have killed people for lots of false gods but no Christians kill in God's name, only in their ignorance of what God desires.<br>

I just purchased SoL and am feeling very happy. I had a rather explicit flame prepared for you, but have decided not to post it. Instead, I am going to wish you well in life and a happy holiday. <br>
