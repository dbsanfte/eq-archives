<br>
<br>
You are lost between &quot;Baby Boomer&quot; and &quot;Generation X&quot; if...<br>
<br>
1. You remember when Jordache jeans with a flat-handle comb in the back<br>
pocket was cool. (Bonus points if the comb had your name printed on it.) <br>
<br>
2. Any photograph of you shows you wearing an Izod shirt with the collar<br>
turned up. <br>
<br>
3. You know any &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic songs by heart. <br>
<br>
4. You've ever rung someone's doorbell and said &quot;Landshark!&quot; <br>
<br>
5. You were once bowled over by the technological excellence of such<br>
products as Atari, IntelliVision, TelStar and Coleco. <br>
<br>
6. You remember the premier of MTV, or worse yet, you remember its<br>
predecessor, &quot;Friday Night Videos.&quot; <br>
<br>
7. You and your friends ever discussed having a reunion at the end of the<br>
century and playing Prince's &quot;1999&quot; until you passed out partying. <br>
<br>
8. A predominant color in your childhood photos is plaid. <br>
<br>
9. You remember when music that was labeled &quot;alternative&quot; really was<br>
alternative, and when &quot;alternative comedy&quot; was really funny. <br>
<br>
10. You took family trips BEFORE the invention of the minivan. <br>
<br>
11. (Related to No. 10) You rode in the back of the station wagon facing the<br>
cars behind you. <br>
<br>
12. You've recently horrified yourself by using any one of the following<br>
phrases: &quot;You know, back when...,&quot; &quot;when I was your age...,&quot; or &quot;when I was<br>
younger...&quot; <br>
<br>
13. Schoolhouse Rock played a HUGE part in how you learned things like<br>
grammar, math, and history. (A big hint here is if the only way you can<br>
recite the Preamble to the Constitution is by singing it.) <br>
<br>
14. You ever dressed to look like someone in a Madonna, Cyndi Lauper or<br>
Duran Duran video. <br>
<br>
15. You remember your first kiss with someone having happened while either<br>
&quot;Leather and Lace&quot; or &quot;Crazy For You&quot; was playing. <br>
<br>
16. You remember with pain the day the Green Machine hit the streets (or the<br>
sidewalks), instantly making your Big Wheel obsolete. <br>
<br>
17. The age-old question &quot;Where's the beef?&quot; still makes you laugh. <br>
<br>
18. You remember when film critics raved that no movie could ever possibly<br>
have more advanced special effects than TRON. <br>
<br>
19. You had a crush on Ted the photographer on &quot;Love Boat,&quot; Gage from<br>
&quot;Emergency,&quot; or Ponch from &quot;CHIPS.&quot; <br>
<br>
20. Your hair at some point in time in the '80s could only be described by<br>
saying &quot;I was experimenting.&quot; <br>
<br>
21. You've ever shopped at Benetton. <br>
<br>
22. You're starting to believe that having the kids in school year round<br>
wouldn't be such a bad idea after all. <br>
<br>
23. You're currently employed doing something that has absolutely nothing to<br>
do with your college major. <br>
<br>
24. U2 is too popular and mainstream for you now. <br>
<br>
25. You remember trying to guess which episode of &quot;The Brady Bunch&quot; it was<br>
by the first scene. <br>
<br>
26. You had a front-row seat (i.e., blew off one or more classes) for Luke<br>
and Laura's wedding on &quot;GH.&quot; <br>
<br>
27. Your parents wanted you to attend medical school, but you decided it was<br>
pointless since Quincy got all the babes anyway. <br>
<br>
28. You know who shot J.R. <br>
<br>
29. You recall when Love's Baby Soft was in every girl's Christmas stocking.<br>
<br>
30. This rings a bell: &quot;My name is Charlie, and they work for me.&quot; <br>
<br>
31. You were unsure if Diet Coke would ever catch on. (Related item: you<br>
were sure that &quot;New Coke&quot; would NEVER catch on.) <br>
<br>
32. You know all the words to the double-album set of the &quot;Grease&quot;<br>
soundtrack. <br>
<br>
33. You've ever had a Dorothy Hamill haircut. <br>
<br>
34. You sat with your friends on any given Friday night circa 1982 and<br>
dialed 867-5309 to see if Jenny was actually there. <br>
<br>
35. &quot;All skate, change directions&quot; means something to you. <br>
<br>
36. You've ever owned a pair of rainbow suspenders like the ones Mork used<br>
to wear. <br>
<br>
37. You bought a pair of Vans and wanted to order a pizza in history class<br>
so you could be just like Jeff Spicoli. (Related item: if you've ever<br>
smacked yourself in the head with a shoe and exclaimed, &quot;I'm so wasted!&quot; <br>
<br>
38. You owned a Preppy Handbook. <br>
<br>
39. You were too young to see &quot;Blue Lagoon,&quot; so you just had to settle for<br>
the second-hand reports. <br>
<br>
40. You remember when movies were only PG and R. <br>
<br>
41. You learned to swim at about the same time &quot;Jaws&quot; came out...and still<br>
carry the emotional scars to prove it. <br>
<br>
42. You remember when your cable TV box had a sliding selector switch...and<br>
your &quot;cable remote&quot; was connected to the TV by a CORD! <br>
<br>
43. Your jaw would ache by the time you finished one of those brick-sized<br>
packages of Bazooka. <br>
<br>
44. You remember Bo and Luke, Duke, Daisy, Boss Hogg, or - worst of all -<br>
what Sheriff Roscoe's full name was. <br>
<br>
45. Your parents paid $2,000 for a top loading VCR that was almost the size<br>
of a coffee table. <br>
<br>
46. You found nothing strange about Bert and Ernie living together. <br>
<br>
47. You remember having a rotary phone. <br>
<br>
48. You actually Believed that Mikey, famed kid on the Life cereal<br>
commercials, died after eating Pop Rocks and drinking a Coke. <br>
<br>
49. &quot;Members Only&quot; jackets...say no more. <br>
<br>
50. And lastly, I'll make a song stick in your head for the rest of the<br>
day...you actually remember the words to the theme song of &quot;The Greatest<br>
American Hero.&quot; (&quot;Believe it or not, I'm walkin' on air...I never thought I<br>
could feel so free-ee-ee...&quot;)<br>
<br>
<br>
This was a YAFEJ (yet-another-forwarded-email-joke) that I got today. Normally I just skim a YAFEJ quickly and maybe get a brief chuckle, but this one really hit home. I'm a hair on the young side, toward GenX, for many (thank God), and I can't relate to the Chick-specific items (Dorothy Hamill hair, crush on Eric E, dress like Madonna). But most are right on. And some are downright scary: 3-6, 13, 44 (Roscoe P. Coletrain), and 48, and several others really. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uluviahoodyhooo.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Luvia Hoodyhooo</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 112<br> <font color=#E9D756>(12/21/01 9:01:57 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Between &quot;Baby Boomer&quot; and &quot;Generation X&q</span><hr size=1> I *STILL* don't know who shot J.R.
