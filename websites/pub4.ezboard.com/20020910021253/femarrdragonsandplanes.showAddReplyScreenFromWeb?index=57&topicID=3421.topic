<br>
Firstly what he did was harrassment/abuse call it what you will, and in the context he did it there is no doubt that it was wrong.<br>
<br>
That being said he hasadmitted it, apologised for it and said it was wrong.<br>
<br>
He has also apologised for his initial post and admitted he lashed out (mainly due to his guild being brought into it, for which the poster also apologised remember).<br>
<br>
Half the people in this very thread have said far FAR worse things on this very forum that what he said (here is where *you* get to deny it if you feel its aimed at *you* although if it doesnt apply to you, ergo you dont need to deny it) and typing lines of text to a person ingame is no more or less meaningful than typing them on a forum such as this.<br>
<br>
So lets summarise.<br>
<br>
He messed up<br>
He apologised<br>
He is young<br>
His guild have 'VERY' likely spoken to him about this already<br>
<br>
The inital posters seem satisfied with what he has said, he is still in his guild so that answers that question, so why kick him about some more?  to prove your moral superiority???<br>
<br>
If he does it again then fine, rip him to bits, but otherwise there is no reason to keep 'harrassing' him.<br>
<br>
<br>
And if he'd said it to me, I'd have told him to fvck off, but thats just me.<br>

<br>
But frankly, and as Smilin is telling me to type in (btw she knows what I've posted, and just choose not to post herself as I was already on the forum posting myself) he did this in open chat, not in tells, in a crowded zone, which disgusted her the most I think.<br>
<br>
I think the worst thing about all this is that I was told by a very nice guy from his previous guild that he was booted from that guild for exactly this kind of behavior, which to me show's that he has not learnt his lesson from before, in fact he's basically given them the finger and carried on his degenerate ways.<br>
<br>
And yeah I gotta admit that this is getting to the point of ending up with Yumten getting harressed which quite honestly isn't going to help matters, but what else can we do, it's not as if I can hop on a plane and fly over to the US to have a quiet word with him is it.<br>
<br>
The amount of tells Smilin has recieved from people saying that he's done this to them as well had us staggered, something is seriously wrong when this kind of thing goes unnoticed or worse unreported, and as a previous poster has said, this isn't a joking matter, this isn't me trying to pull a prank on someone, this is a VERY serious issue, one which I'm sure we know will not be solved by Verant unless more people have /reported what he says in the future.<br>
<br>
In the end the outcome of this will be as one guy said to Smilin earlier today when we were in VL &quot;Is that the Yumten that said those things to you&quot;, Smilin does a quick /w for VL and reply's &quot;yeah that was him&quot; to which the other person reply's &quot;well f**k him he ain't joining my group&quot;.<br>
<br>
In the end this is the only punishment we can hope that will be administered, at the end of the day both me and Smilin feel a good reputation in EQ means more than any amount of uber items or thousands of plat can bestow upon an individual.<br>
<br>
We'll just let the members of the Emarr server judge this issue for themselves and decide if they want to be associated with this individual.<br>
<br>
At the end of the day I think this will be my last post on this person and this matter, basically we're going to leave this alone now, we've said all we want to say, poeple have been given the facts as we see them, so enough is enough, and of course Yumten is on our ignore lists from now on.<br>

<br>
Au contraire.  Just a fact you should be aware of, many people, men and women, when subjected to abuse/harassment feel embarassed and ashamed, and you'd be surprised how often it DOESN'T get reported for this very reason.<br>
<br>
Even in the case of actual physical rape, people do not report it, but attempt to deal with it internally, which is the wrong way to go about it, but you don't always make the right decisions when you're put in a situation that embarrasses you and makes you uncomfortable.<br>
<br>
So just because the person harassed didn't post doesn't mean it didn't bother her.  <br>
<br>
Speculating something like that almost makes it seem like you condone it.  Oh, well she didn't complain, so it must be okay.  Frankly, had someoen spoken up earlier about his alleged prior incidents, we might not be lookin' at this thread.<br>
<br>

Kudos to Smilin' and her bf for havin the guts to at least bring it out in the open.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
I believe you are referring to me and I think you are taking PART of what I said and presenting it out of context. I spent most of that thread making it darn clear I did NOT condone it. My point is that I believe that reporting such behavior is the right thing to do. Reporting such behavior does the whole community a service by giving Verant the chance to remove this pox from our &quot;land&quot;. While posting about it here makes us all aware, I think filing a report should be done first. My opinions goes specifically to this quote from you:<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;Frankly, had someoen spoken up earlier about his alleged prior incidents, we might not be lookin' at this thread.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
the NEXT time it happens, will you agree with me that if enough of the victims of his prior offenses had reported his action through the proper channels, we might not be looking at the NEXT thread.<br>
This is not an indictment of either poo or Smilin, just stating my opinion. <br>
If you read my whole post, and not just the parts you refer to and you honestly think I was condoning this child's behavior, let me know and I will be sure to clarify just how much I DONT condone it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ubirren.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Birren</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 329<br> <font color=#E9D756>(6/23/02 9:40:02 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3421.topic&index=110>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: taking small offense</span><hr size=1> cant hear anything from him if you have him on ignore <p><a href='http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=248327'>Birren Anklebiter</a><BR>
