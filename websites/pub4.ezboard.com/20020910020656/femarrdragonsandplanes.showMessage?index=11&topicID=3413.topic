I don't want to portray the average &quot;pirate&quot; as noble or even rebellious, but there are times when morally repugnant actions are preferable to even more distasteful inactions. Robin Hood is the classic myth of a hero who stole. Maybe he just didn't want to work for a living? The recent corporal punishment thread presents another example: we discipline our kids with mild pain or denial of their wants in an attempt to improve them. People imprison or kill other people and some get labelled murderers, while others are called heros.<br>
<br>
  Most pirates don't have any socially redeeming intent in their actions, but I would argue that it's possible that their selfish actions send an important message or two to the software industry. (Insert your own capitalistic argument here about the benefits of selfish behavior to society.) I've had 20 years of experience with software, and I am a programmer now, and at worst I see piracy as a mixture of positive and negative forces. I don't consider it right, in a perfect world, but I believe there is valid justification for the practice in our current situation.<br>
<br>
  And if you'd like to see a picture of a closet full of legally purchased software, I could make one. (I won't though, I'm lazy.) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uionas.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ionas</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 134<br> <font color=#E9D756>(6/25/02 9:40:17 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3413.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Hmmn</span><hr size=1> First off, let me say I'm no angel myself. I have a few 'special' copies of apps, and a couple of full CDs that I burned myself from mp3s. With that out of the way, software pirating is stealing, plain and simple. Yes, it's different from walking into a bank with a loaded gun and demanding a bag full of money, it's a big grey area.<br>
When you copy a program, you are denying the original creator the rightful bounty of his/her labors. Yes you can buy a copy of a Picasso, but someone had to produce that copy and when you purchase the replica, he or she is getting paid. If you steal a copy of a Picasso you still stole something, even if it wasn't an original work.<br>
Anyway, no amount of justification can change the fact that when you download a copy of a game/song/whatever without paying for it you're as much of a thief as a kid who takes a candy bar from a store.<br>

Certainly you could say there are significant differences between a statue by Rodin and a picture of the statue, but most people don't care about the texture of a painting by Matisse vs. the print of the painting. Is theoretically depriving someone of potential income really stealing? I'm not saying it's right or wrong, but I do think ethics and morality have gotten a lot more complicated as technology changes.<br>
<br>
  Just look at the Christian religions. Some say that it is a sin to even think about committing sinful acts, even if you don't do it. They make little or no differentiation between the desire and the act itself. I see their point of view, but I disagree. I can see lusting after another's spouse as a wrong, but a minor weakness if no action is ever taken to turn that desire into reality.<br>
<br>
  In the same way I would distinguish between copying and stealing. Both may be wrong ethically and morally, but one is clearly wrong, while the other is so shrouded in gray areas that few people consider it truly bad.<br>
<br>
  Since you brought up music, I just have to mention the complete confusion that is a consumer's rights. We can sing the lyrics to ourselves, but not to others, unless we're circumspect. We can't put the lyrics on a website without the risk of lawsuit, even though those lyrics may be clear as day in the song publically broadcasted. We can record songs off television and radio with no legal or moral repercussions, but if we downloaded someone else's recording off those same devices, we are committing either a copyright violation or a crime. Technically we don't own most of the music or games we buy, but we are probably committing a crime if we get a new copy from someone else to replace one we lost or have in a less useful format. (i.e. vinyl vs CD vs tape)<br>
<br>
  One thing a set of laws affecting all consumers should be, is easily comprehensible. The courts claim that ignorance of the law is no excuse, but the world is quickly turning into a Kafka-esque mish mash of conflicting and overlapping rules. Old rules are still clear: don't kill without governmental permission, don't steal physical items. New rules are less clear. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/umahtanhonorshield.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mahtan Honorshield</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 374<br> <font color=#E9D756>(6/26/02 2:15:15 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3413.topic&index=14>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Hmmn</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> We can record songs off television and radio with no legal or moral repercussions, but if we downloaded someone else's recording off those same devices, we are committing either a copyright violation or a crime.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Actually, it's the guy or girl who lets you download it that commits the copyright violation or crime. They're the one distributing it. <p>--<br>

<br>
Depends.  Does the artist/owner make money by selling photographs/lithographs/projections of his work?  If so then yes you would be.  Most major exhibits prohibit the use of photography for this very reason.<br>
<br>
Allowing picture taking may not directly rob them of income but it does devalue the pictures/prints/projections that they market themselves.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Is theoretically depriving someone of potential income really stealing?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
The simple answer is yes.   You're using their work without paying for it in a market economy, that's the simplest form of stealing.  It doesn't matter the method by which you procured it. <br>
<br>
 It's an A B scenario:  A made/wrote/produced/created something, B is using that something, A requires payment for use of its work, B didn't pay - B is a thief.  In the software scenario the CD isn't the item being sold, the code on the CD is what is being sold - if you copy, clone, hack, or crack it you're stealing the code.<br>
<br>
The question isn't whether its stealing.  That's easy.  The question is whether if stealing is the right thing to do in certain circumstances.<br>
<br>
I can think of many examples where stealing is actually very healthy for society and our economy.<br>

PS - In most cases its not the copying of an item that is illegal it's the distribution of those copied items.  Most companies don't care that John has an illegal copy of their software, it sitting there in his room does little harm.  But when John decides to bulk copy that software and distribute it for free or for a small profit then that is a huge problem.  First the code isn't his, second he has no right to reproduce it further, third he's devaluing the author's code, fouth he's making a profit  (either monetarily or in reputation) off of someone elses work without due compensation to them.... there are a ton of issues wrong with it. <p><center> <a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=10051"> <img src="http://www.perfectblueproductions.com/eric/cerunew2.jpg" border="0"></a></center>

I just feel that potentially places too many limits on the exchange of thoughts, ideas, stories, etc., that I place a higher value on than the commercial exploitation of artistic works. It leads to absurd arguments that one could not describe a piece of art to another, for fear of diminishing the resale or performance value. The intent of copyright, as little as I understand it, is to promote the development of artistic works for society by allowing some control over performance and distribution. That doesn't mean a failure to reap 100% of potential profits is a breach of the spirit of copyright, which didn't even make unauthorized copying a crime, merely an action that one could sue for in civil court.<br>
<br>
  I will just have to state that it is my opinion that such copying does not constitute stealing, any more than competition constitutes stealing from a competitor. No one is guaranteed a sale. Right or wrong is another issue entirely.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showPrevMessage?topicID=3413.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showNextMessage?topicID=3413.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3413.topic&index=5><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/gfx/addReply1.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.emailToFriend?topicID=3413.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.threadControl?topicID=3413.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/deleteThreadFire.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=3413.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=3413.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub4.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="emarrmessageboardrules">Message Board Rules<option value="emarrlinks">Links<option value="emarrupcomingmmorpgs">Upcoming MMOG's<option value="emarrfrm18">America Under Attack<option value="emarrfrm19">Dark Age of Camelot<option value="emarrgeneral">General<option value="emarrfrm17">Funny Stuff<option value="emarrbazaar">Item Bazaar<option value="emarrscrollsnspells">Spell Bazaar<option value="emarrfrm15">Shiny Things<option value="emarrfrm14">Bargain Basement<option value="emarrfrm20">Crafter's Hideout<option value="emarrdragonsandplanes">Rants and Flames<option value="emarrfrm13">Dragons and Planes<option value="emarrroleplaying">Roleplaying<option value="emarrroleplayingoocforum">Roleplaying - OOC Forum<option value="emarrscammeralert">Scammer Alert<option value="emarrsignaturecorner">Test Forum<option value="emarrreallife">Real Life<option value="emarrothermmorpgs">Other MMOG's</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#E9D756>- </font><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/bemarr>Erollisi Marr, The Queen of Love</a><font color=#E9D756> - </font><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes>Rants and Flames</a> <font color=#E9D756> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM GAMES AD SCRIPT -->
