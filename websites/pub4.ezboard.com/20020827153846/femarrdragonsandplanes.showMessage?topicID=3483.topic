The camp in Skyfire is free for all. And to a certain extent, the guilds are as if not more responsible for that free for all status. The cleric clicker is a raid tool with some very nice stats. That is all it has ever been. <br>

There are a number of guilds on various servers that just zerg mobs they would never have been able to before, and it reduces the time people take on raids because wipeouts used to be an issue whereas now they're not. <br>
<br>
It is by far the most useful of all epic items.<br>
<br>
However although I believe that the quests should be epic and not widely available, I disagree with Verant's method of making them so. Verant's idea of making something difficult involves a very simple flow chart<br>
<br>
<br>
Is it a mob ------Yes-------- make it do obscene amounts of damage<br>
|<br>
|<br>
|<br>
| No<br>
|<br>
|<br>
|<br>
|<br>
Take one mob needed for the quest and make it pop once every blue moon.<br>
<br>
Personally I think RF should pop in a different zone every time.<br>
<br>
Verant stated with the Fiery Avenger that these would no be made available to everyone, but now all you hear is people whining about how &quot;That's not fair, I can't get my epic&quot;<br>
<br>
All they did was make the game a time sink.<br>
<br>
Here's a question : What category does EQ fall into now? It's not an action game because you can spend weeks playing this game and not do anything remotely active, it's not a roleplaying game because it has no storyline at all and hardly anybody plays a role any more. Ineptly it was named everQUEST when in reality it's more about sitting in one spot for 12 hours at time. <p><CENTER><A HREF="http://ak.lonelygamer.com">

This was to be my 5th and last Ragefire camp - if we did not get the kill then I was giving up - after over 400 hours sitting in SF.<br>
<br>
The reason clerics say that the camp was much better in SolB was that once you started the camp - you KNEW you were going to have your epic in 72 hours as long as you got the people there to kill him.  Personally I would quite like the sitting there peacefully for 8 hours before getting people to come back and clear the FGs.  It would be far better than the grief that you get in SF with people (often druids or monks on behalf of a cleric) coming up to you saying &quot;I am claiming Ragefire camp, my guild is bigger than yours so bugger off&quot;.<br>
<br>
During my camp I had several other guilds clerics come up and claim the camp - the most obnoxious of which belonged to PC (Who incidentally KS'd my 4th camp as people were assembling - without even asking if it was camped - which it clearly was since I was sitting in the centre and had been getting good-wish tells across ooc for most the the morning) who said &quot;F*** you, my guild is bigger and I will have the kill cos I want it.&quot;  Not a literal quote but close enough.  I will admit that since the incident I have had several people from PC come up to me and say they feel shamed of this clerics attitude so that tar brush most certainly does not extend to the full guild - some members I know DO respect the camp.<br>
<br>
This kind of attitude is what, quite frankly stinks, it took intervention of a friend in another higher-profiled guild to say butt out, you know we can take the kill.  In the end it was agreed that as long as we kept 18 people at the camp at all times they would not KS the camp.  I mean 18 people FFS - that did not happen in SolB - 18 people rather than just the one who had to be bored to tears.<br>
<br>
In the end, we took Ragefire down with 58 people helping from many different Guilds as well as my own (MF, DG, aToF, Affliction to name but a few) after over 88 hours sitting in SF with the grief and hassle associated with the camp.<br>
<br>
Ask me now was it worth it I might probably say yes.  Ask me at the time and you would probably have gotten your head bitten off - it is not a stress free camp like it was in SolB.  It is not the guilds that are causing the problem, it is OTHER clerics pulling their guilds into the argument.  I have named a certain guild because of the RF camps that have been KS'd off friends - 60% were by that guild.  I mean - just how many clerics in your guild need the epic so desperately that you have to KS another cleric to get it.  Put some damn respect back into the camp - not everyone has MB wizzies to call on or has played as long as I have that you have as many people to call on for assistance.  Surely smaller guilds deserve as much chance of their clerics getting the epic as larger guilds - or are we truly lowering ourselves to the &quot;Right is might&quot; stance that seems to be spewed out constantly at the RF camp.<br>
<br>
Anyway - not as small a rant as Ript, but then again - he only had the one nightmare camp.<br>

<br>
First off congrats to you on your epic.  I know it was a long time coming.<br>
<br>
Next, as an officer of PC, let me reply to a couple of things.<br>
<br>
First, we DON'T condone KS'ing, but the server has pretty much adopted the standard that Rage is a FFA kill, meaning those who can field the kill force most quickly get it.  I fully realize there have been exceptions to that from time to time...and GM's rule one way, then another.  But I think that's a fair generalization.  You can pretty well bet there will be a race to Rage almost every time he is up.<br>
<br>
Second, we know of one occasion when there were miscommunications with you and your folks, and things were said and done that were less than friendly.  I was not there that time, so I cannot address specifics.  HOWEVER, the statement about we're bigger, so we'll take it IS NOT and never WILL BE guild policy.  It may have been a person's emotions at the scene, but that's not what we support.  I know some pretty caustic remarks were relayed from your side as well, but we certainly don't consider them representative of your guild at all...they were simply heated comments from one individual.  <br>
<br>
I also know that there have been several times (your most recent attempt, for instance) when OTHER guilds or individuals have been present exhibiting the same type of behavior.  I further know that we have STEPPED DOWN to guilds before...even when we had killing forces present...to avoid confrontations with others who were only equally or lesser prepared.  Finally, I only know of around 3 epics we have even gotten from Rage since the camp was moved to SF, so I think it is unlikely we are responsible for 60 percent of &quot;KS&quot;'s.<br>
<br>
The sad reality of this endgame is that it is all a race...a race to Rage, to ToV, to Klandicar...you name it.  Whoever gets there first and does the kill, wins.  It has happened to us repeatedly from older guilds (in fact, it still does), and it will happen to others.  <br>
<br>
But that is neither here nor there...I think we are all happy you got your epic and you can now rest.  But we are a group of people just like you...some passive, some aggressive...if we can all think on that, it's a bit easier to work together.<br>
<br>
Congratulations again.<br>

I really don't see the point of making RF so damn rare. Why not up him a little bit? Tweak his level, tweak his dps, and make him triggered.<br>
<br>
End of story, less cleric epics enter the game, because less guilds can achieve the quest. With the addition of Luclin and Velious since epics were put into the game, they have been trivialized for many guilds. These quests are no longer of epic proportions.<br>
<br>
Remember when the wizard epic involved a skin of &quot;a&quot; cazic thule? That was changed because Cazic was tweaked. Now, that the game has progressed so much, why can't they replace or tweak existing quests?<br>
<br>
They have shown that they do not care about the player economy, when they tweaked existing items. Why should they care about this? Granted a warning would be nice, but simply saying &quot;Epic quests have been made epic once again&quot; would work fine for me.<br>
<br>
Not everyone is going to get their epic, or so I am told. However, recently it appears as though those who do not complete their epic don't, because they don't feel a need to, not because they can not.<br>
<br>
Upgrade the epics, increase the difficulty of the quests, make all encounters triggered rather than camps.<br>
<br>
And lastly on my wish last, Prince Thirneg should give &quot;phat&quot; items when asked.  <p><center><img src="http://www.crosswinds.net/~ofthesword/sig1.txt"><br><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=180294" target="_blank">Helius Wallace!</a><br>

<br>
I personally feel that Ragefire should be a triggered spawn like the Druid epic and even be made a little harder if necessary.  At least then there could surely be no arguments over it - the one who triggered him is the one entitled to the heart.<br>
<br>
Another deplorable tactic, one used by certain other guilds, is to have a druid there (you wondered why they camp RF with a camp not a cleric??) and to kite the human form until re-enforcements get there.  In the rules of VI, the first person to engage the mob is the one awarded the kill in the event of a dispute.  This tactic is even worse in my opinion - at least KS'ing groups have the people there to take him down when they engage.<br>
<br>
I agree that words were said on either side during my last camp and I apologise - after 47 hours then a damn server reset and another 20 hours (24 hours a day camp) your temper gets a little flared up.  The slightest provovation is all that is needed - personally I just ignored everyone who was rubbing me the wrong way - bit my fingers rather than my tongue if you will.  For that I apologise.<br>

I have to say that this is a tactic I've suggested to many clerics in smaller guilds.  When they are clearly camping ragefire and they feel intimidated by larger guilds who pop in continuously this is the one thing that can/will save them.<br>
<br>
Even when you're only buying time to buff and prep your groups its the only sure way to keep yourself from being ganked by someone with more power who will win if they know that all they have to do is engage first.<br>
<br>
I can say that Im truly lucky to have had the support I did when I decided to camp my ragefire.  Wonderful friends to see me through it and a fantabulous guild to support me for the battle.  It was a very very frustrating week for me and I have to give a lot of credit to any cleric and their friends who sits in the zone for days after all that has been said and done, and I give even more credit to those who have had to do it repeatedly. <p>Baroness Syldra Marlowe<br>High Priest ~ Affliction<p><font size=1>
It's probably wrong to believe there can be any limit to the horror which the human mind can experience.  On the contrary, it seems that some exponential effect begins to obtain as deeper and deeper darkness falls- as little as one may like to admit it, human experience tends, in a good many ways, to support the idea that when the nightmare grows black enough, horror spawns horror, one coincidental evil begets other, often more deliberate evils, until finally blackness seems to cover everything.

In PC's defense, we had a RF incident a few weeks ago and even though both guilds had force sitting in SF, their cleric (Scyrra) made the decision to back off and give the camp to our cleric who had been there first.  Fortunately, there are still some clerics who have a respect for the camp.<br>

Smilin's camp was a rough one - no doubt about that and quite a few people should be ashamed of themselves, but they won't be. <p>Tormentcia

I kind of take a different view.  I don't think the problem is Ragefire.  I think it's the cleric epic effect.  They simply made the epic too good, such that it became viewed as an &quot;essential&quot; thing to have (and it is).  If it were at the same level of usefulness as the other epics (i.e. it sucked), many fewer clerics would pursue the quest, and the stupid bottleneck wouldn't be a problem.<br>

You now have your wishes.<br>
<br>
Due to recent press coverage of the amount of time it takes to complete the cleric epic they have now totally revamped the whole thing as of todays patch.<br>
<br>
The quest itself has not changed and you will still be required to kill Ragefire however the cleric epic effect has now been changed to True North. This change is not retroactive but any clerics who wish to have their epic changed to the new effect should contact a GM in game. Earlier this morning Scott Sanders of Sony Online Entertainment had this to say;<br>
<br>
&quot;We at SOE and VI have long been aware of the problem that clerics have had with their epic quest and earlier this year we changed the quest in an attempt to rectify the situation. We are, however, aware that his change produced some rather unfortunate and unexpected results. We are thoroughly convinced that this afternoon's patch will eliminate the bottleneck Ragefire has presented&quot;<br>
<br>
Scott also took the time to mention that any clerics who wish to complete the old style cleric quest can do so by visiting <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://everquest.legends.com">everquest.legends.com</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--> and subscribing to the new Stormhammer server.<br>

I think it was respected because it required a hand in, and stealing the mob resulted in restarting the epic.  <br>
<br>
I still fail to understand how they figure this change would reduce a bottleneck.  They made the mob spawn less than before...<br>
<br>
To be quite honest, no disrepect to anyone, its pretty silly to claim 'camp' on a known FFA mob then complain later about how nobody respected your camp.  Ragefire sucks, I think its worse now, but this is how it is....<br>

Heh!<br>
<br>
Report just in from Stormhammer:<br>
<br>
The cleric epic effect has been upgraded from its previous form. It now not only bestows a 96% experience resurection, but also has the added benefit of Celestial Elixir, which should cut down the cleric's required mana usage even more. <p>Blaesteil<br>

I have to disagree. <br>
<br>
If you saw some lower level druid kiting a mob (any mob) and was snaring and dotting or whatever.... and then you ran up and killed it &quot;because you had the firepower to do so&quot; (or whatever you said), because you really wanted the 6 copper it was carrying, would this not be a KS? <br>
<br>
You damn friggin skippy it would be. Every person that saw you (I know you would never do this) gank the n00b would point a crooked finger and tell how low that was. And any GM would ive you a solid tongue lashing.<br>
<br>
Don't say RF is different. He's not. It's a mob and that druid or whatever is kiting has every right to do so. He engaged it first... end of story. (If he/she dies in the process... different story.)<br>
<br>
Should not matter if its an orc or Tunare. <br>
