I have read it and I can tell you that Jesus does NOT call for people to kill in the name of Him, His Father, or His Spirit.

<br>
If I go into McDonalds and yell "I do this for MUzaak" and then open fire killing everyone... does that mean it is what you wanted?  Does that mean that I should blame you?<br>
<br>
I find it sickening when people make fun of God because of what idiots claim to do in His name.  Doesn't take a genius to pick up the Bible, read it, and say.. "nope, God had no hand in this."<br>
<br>
Oh, and Muzaak, TRUE Christians aren't perfect (nor is anyone), they are just saved people who keep trying to be perfect.  Why are we hypocrties? Because as Christians we soemtimes do things that aren't Christian like?<br>
<br>
So if you are a father you always act father-like then?  Never play a game when you should be paying a bit of attention to the kid?  If you are a brother you always act like a brother then right? Always jump to help brother/sister when they need it?  If you are a son you always act in a way to make your parents proud right?  Whatever.. you find the example.. and you tell me you aren't a hypocrite by your own definition. <p><font color=green><b>Cendan Tankenpriest</b></font color><br>

Cendan, since you claim to be an avid reader of the Bible, please tell me what god commanded should be done to Witches, homosexuals, and prostitutes? He commands to kill them. Hmmm... in fact, just read most of the old testament of the Christian scriptures again to find where god orders the genocide of entire peoples. If you want I can dig around Deuteronomy, Leviticus, Exodus and pull out some quotes?<br>
<br>
BTW, if you want to say something like &quot;Christ's act of death on the cross&quot; abolishes the law of the Old Testament then please explain why an infinitely perfect being such as god had to change his mind about the law he gave to Moses? Was he wrong? Or is the New Testament &quot;more perfect&quot; meaning god handed Moses a less than perfect set of laws? If that is the case, then god really is not an infintely perfect being... god makes mistakes. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>Lurikeen Mali'Kyre<BR>

I actually want to point out that the Ten Commandents were given as moral law to the people in order that they might know what sin was.  It was imperative that the people know what sin was, and then how to atone for it.  This was done in preparation for Jesus, who was our ultimate sacrifice, and our atonement.  Without the understanding of what sin is, and our relization that we cannot avoid it, we would not have understood what the death of a sinless Jesus who was fully man and fully God would even mean.  So, God did not make any mistake.  He sent the commandents to prepare the world for Jesus, and what his death meant to us.  It was planned.  If you read through the entire bible and actually read and study Revelations, you'll see what God's end result will be.<br>

<br>
You are entirely correct in that Christ's act of death on the cross abolishes the law of the Old Testament.<br>
<br>
As far as God "changing His mind".. I look at it as God showing man kind that he gave us every possibility of doing it our way and proved that we are imperfect, and need help in reaching Him.<br>
<br>
You mentioned Leviticus. Read Leviticus and then read Hewbrews.. its actually amazing how God planned the Old to be a representation of the New.<br>
<br>
God showed in the Old Testament what it meant to not be part of His Kingdom.  In the Old Testament it was a physical Kingdom and in the New Testament it is a spiritual kingdom.. but by reading the old I know how he feels about His chosen people.<br>
<br>
Anyway, the point was that Christians, which did not exist before the cross, do not kill people for God. <p><font color=green><b>Cendan Tankenpriest</b></font color><br>

I thought the implications of my statements were pretty clear but let me say it a little more plain.<br>
<br>
<br>
First, they have never killed people FOR GOD.  They may have killed, they may have said it was for God, but it was NOT for God because GOD certainly has not called them to do so.<br>
<br>
If God's big plan under the new covenant was to kill sinners he could have found much easier ways.<br>
<br>
Second, they were not Christians.  To be more clear, "Christian" is a term not used often in the Bible.. its more of a human devised label.  Let's assume in this instance that the term "Christian" means someone who follows the Bible and God's plan for His children.  Based upon that the people who carried out the Spanish Inquisitions were not "Christians."  Lets make one more big and false assumption.  Lets assume that the people who killed people who would not confess Christ were Christians (who accepted Christ AND were baptized for remission of sins, as required by the Bible) ... I previously stated that Christians make mistakes and unless you don't you really don't have room to talk.<br>
<br>
BUT, beyond all that... the point I made was that people do not kill for God, no matter what they claim.<br>
<br>
Now, if you can find me a place where God asks his Church to kill on His behalf.... <p><font color=green><b>Cendan Tankenpriest</b></font color><br>

The laws of the Old Testament are no longer considered binding for the most part.  It's true that different denominations and different Christians sometimes treat the old laws differently, but the fact is that no respected branch of Christianity today considers it acceptable to kill people in the name of God.  It's true that some Christian cults have been known to do so, as well as some individuals, but holding all Christians responsible for that (or for the Inquisition or Crusades, for that matter) is a lot like holding all Germans responsible for anti-Semitism.  There are Germans who hate Jews, and in the past hatred of Jews was a norm in Germany.  Does that make someone of German descent today responsible for those crimes?  I don't think so.  Some of you guys accusing Christians of bigotry and such need to look in the friggin' mirror.  I'm seeing bigotry all over this thread and this forum, and it's not coming from Christians. <p>Ahry - hero of Gaoth an Iar, Percival server <BR>

<br>
The original premise presented was that Christians killed in the of god and used the Bible in their defense.<br>
<br>
Nobody is saying that is true of ALL Christians. What has been stated is that many thousands of people have died in the name of religion through out history. Christianity is not exempt.<br>
<br>
I would expect Christians to pipe up (and Muslims) and say "Not in the name of my god!" <br>
<br>
I also expected to read from those like Arikel and Cendan who want to quote the Bible as the authoritative word of god, but then pick and choose what is authoratative! Cendan go back to the Old Testament and read where Yahweh (God, YOUR god) commands the Hebrews to kill entire peoples, women and children... right down to their livestock! Now did your god command that or didn't he? If he did what kind of monster would have commanded as much?! The god of the Old Testament makes Hitler look like a choir boy. <p>Lurikeen Mali'Kyre<BR>

First off, I am not Christian and I don't quote the Bible as the authoritative word of God.  I'm talking about modern Christians, what someone may or may not have done a few thousand years ago doesn't necessarily reflect on the actions of modern Christians.  How does the fact that people were killed in the name of Christ in the Middle Ages reflect on the modern Christian?  As far as those of us outside that religion are concerned, it doesn't.  You claim you are not accusing all Christians of murder, but you sure seem willing to hold them responsible for it.  If you are truly coming at this from a historical angle and not trying to make accusations, why the hostility toward Cendan?  I haven't seen a personal attack from him on this thread, only from his critics. <p>Ahry - hero of Gaoth an Iar, Percival server <BR>

You painted all non-christians posting in this thread as "bigots".<br>
<br>
Also, I am not personally attacking you or Cendan and I think you are reading hostility where there is none. :) Indeed, what I stated early was that Cendan is in denial about the history of Christianity or he knows nothing about it. I fail to see that as a personal attack. Cendan, if your feelings got hurt accept my apology.<br>
<br>
I did answer your questions Arikel. Further, in answer to your questions regarding painting all Christians with the same historical brush that just was not done. Again the original premise was that Christians and Muslims (not all of them!) have used their holy books to defend killing in the name of god. I am not "holding" anyone responsible for the history of Christianity, Islam, or Judaism. The scathing remarks are concerning those who would use the name of their god to murder. And, if you want an example of modern Christians invoking the name of god to help them kill just listen to them pray for god's help in killing the Taliban. I heard GW Bush pray such a prayer on national television.<br>
<br>
Let me repeat so you are not confused any longer...<br>
<br>
I am NOT accusing ALL Christians or Muslims of killing in the name of their god; neither am I holding them ALL responsible. However, I will press the point that people in ALL monotheistic religions commited atrocities in their histories and some continue to do so to this day. Really, what do you think happened in Jerusalem this weekend, Arikel? <p>Lurikeen Mali'Kyre<BR>

<br>
I think that qualifies as a personal attack.  I dunno, maybe you don't read it as such.  Note that Cendan and Solathan say essentially the same thing about their respective faiths, yet you seem to feel the need to single Cendan out.  What makes Christianity and Islam so different that you feel the need to treat Christians like ignorant bumpkins when their enterpretation of their faith conflicts with your own?<br>
<br>
As for this pot and kettle business, I pointed out that there is a lot of bigotry in this thread and on this forum and that it is not coming from Christians.  In no way did I state or imply that all non-Christians on this thread are bigoted.  I admit after thinking about it that there are a couple Christian posters to this forum who are showing bigotry toward others as well; however, that certainly seems to me to be the exception to the rule. <p>Ahry - hero of Gaoth an Iar, Percival server <BR>

We're reading in two different contexts.

For example, statements like &quot;Christians do this&quot; or &quot;Muslims do that&quot; are obviously not referring to some minority or some group in the past.  Solathan and Cendan post in defense of their faiths.  Your attack on Cendan's post sure looks to me like you're supporting those generalizations made by others earlier in the thread.  Maybe you weren't posting in support of their posts, but to someone who doesn't know what's going on in your head it looks that way.<br>

First, I am not singling out Cendan. Second, I said that I was not personally attacking you or Cendan. You seem to want to refuse to accept that.

The lack of understanding going on Arikel seems to surround your insistence on not accepting my clarifications. Didn't I write that I was not saying ALL Christians? Didn't I? What part of &quot;not ALL&quot; is unlcear to you? <br>
<br>
You will be thankfull to know Arikel that I will not be responding to anymore of your posts. The height of irrationality is when one refuses to hear (read) and accept what another is saying. Arikel, you are displaying such a behavior. <p>Lurikeen Mali'Kyre<BR>

<br>
That was a reference to Muzaak's and Brutas222's posts, not to yours.  Note the chronological order in that post... I refer to Muzaak and Brutas222, then to Solathan and Cendan, and then to you.  Sorry I wasn't more clear, I was reviewing the thread in chronological order rather than making random statements about it's content.  Let me clarify my last post:<br>
<br>
1)  Brutas and Muzaak make sweeping generalizations about a couple different groups.<br>
<br>
2)  Solathan posts in defense of his faith.<br>
<br>
3)  Cendan posts in defense of his faith.<br>
<br>
4)  You post attacking Cendan's defense of his faith.<br>
<br>
What I'm trying to say here is that looking at the entire thread as a whole, you appear to be backing up Muzaak's generalizations about Christians and then trying to cover your ass when criticized for it.  After rereading the entire thread and your responses, I can see that your posts might not have anything to do with Muzaak's and simply be attacking Cendan's statements as individual arguements.  If that is the case, my implication that you are a bigot was unfounded and I'm sorry.  I stand by my statement that there is an apalling level of bigotry on this forum and in this thread, but I'm willing to take you on your word that you're not part of that. <p>Ahry - hero of Gaoth an Iar, Percival server <BR>

I can face the History.  Once again I point out that the people who are responsible for the Spanish Inquisition were not Christians so they are not a part of a Christians history, but if you would like to actually show me an example of a REAL Christian (belief in baptism for remission of sins is essential- don't give me examples of Catholics).<br>

I find that interesting since you put words in his mouth, and then throw your words in his face.<br>
<br>
<font color=yellow>I also expected to read from those like Arikel and Cendan who want to quote the Bible as the authoritative word of god, but then pick and choose what is authoratative! Cendan go back to the Old Testament and read where Yahweh (God, YOUR god) commands the Hebrews to kill entire peoples, women and children... right down to their livestock! Now did your god command that or didn't he? If he did what kind of monster would have commanded as much?! The god of the Old Testament makes Hitler look like a choir boy. </font color><br>

Please tell me where I pick and choose.  Didn't think so.  I am aware of what God commanded in the Old Testament.  You don't like it?  God made you and doesn't need to care whether you approve (RE-READ THAT, I didn't say He doesn't, because I don't speak where He has not).  You think that God killing people is cruel?

Thanks for the admission that your god did in fact command the Hebrews to kill entire peoples, women and children included.
