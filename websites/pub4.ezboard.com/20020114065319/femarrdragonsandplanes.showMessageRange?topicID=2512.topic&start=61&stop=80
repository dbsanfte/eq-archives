I guess somebody wasn't around for my misogynistic bitch rant. If calling someone "ghey" can lead to conclusions that label oneself homophobic, then I'll rightly assume that calling someone a stupid bitch (such as yourself) insinuates that oneself is zoo-phobic. I'm sure /you/ know what a zoo is."<br>
<br>
So you aren't a feminist?  Then you didn't know that men suffered as much as women in the "history" you stated?  What other conclusion could be made from using the word "ghey"?  You clearly meant it as a durogatory term.  If calling someone "ghey" is an insult to you then you must not have a high opinion of gay people.  Calling someone a "stupid bitch" would insinuate that you don't like stupid people and liken them to a lower life form called a "dog".  It is usually used as derogatory term for females though you haven't used it properly here.  Yes I know what a zoo is but I don't see how it applies.<br>
<br>
"Yes, I formulated those opinions of you by reading the content of your posts. Note the word "content." I don't see how you can compare me forming an opinion of you based on your content and you asserting an opinion can be formed by a number. And yes, I read your bullshit."<br>
<br>
Content = nature of the posts.  This has been my point all along.  I never said an opinion could be formed by a number I was saying the exact opposite.  I can form no opinion of Kyborras' trustworthiness as I have no "content" to review.  You have read volumes into what I said that I never implied.<br>
<br>
"If you really want to formulate an opinion on an individual, get off your goddamn ass and log onto EQ, track the fucker down, then talk to him. It isn't his/her job to make sure gheydork_03 knows him/her through the boards."<br>
<br>
That is what I am doing only I started the night this post first went up.  Why do you assume I have not?<br>
<br>
"Now, my question is this. If I actually had a life and I rarely frequented the boards, which forum should I go to to up my post count so you can have a basis to judge me by? General? But, what if I have 100 posts to my name, but I've only used the Item Bazaar? I don't think you can formulate an opinion of me based on my WTS posts. But then again, wtf do I care? Do I really care what Ogmadork thinks of me?"<br>
<br>
A high number indicates nothing.  Only a low number indicates that there exists no information on this board supplied by the poster that may qualify their post as having any validity.  A high number post does not guarentee this.  I only suggests that such information may exist and that you might be able to access it if you wished to.  Just because I said that a low post number of "1" lacks credibility, with no other outside information available, does not mean that the opposite is also true.  "Ogmadork"?  Is that the same as "Aishengeek"?<br>
<br>
"How many posts should I put behind my name before I'm allowed to warn people of possible scammers in the scammers forum without random fuk-fuks like yourself telling me I haven't enough credibility to post there?"<br>
<br>
I never said you had to have a high post count to warn people of scammers.  I don't have any control over what people do, all I can do is choose not to listen to them.  Honestly I don't know where you get this stuff.  I never said those things.  You have jumped on a bandwagon headed in the wrong direction.  No one has posted a quote yet that has me saying that.<br>
<br>
"Here's my next question. Which forums are restricted to people with less than a certain number of posts to their names? And what's the breaking point? At what number am I considered "credible?" Does it mean more to the EMarr community if Aishen at 500+ posts gets scammed than if Poor_Dude_01 with 2 posts gets scammed? If Caliss (I'm just using him because I know he doesn't have many EMarr posts to his name) comes here and reports a scam, is his report less credible than boo-boo-lazy-Aishen's report? While I'm surfing the internet, he's raiding and grouping. I'll be damned if people have more of an opinion of me than him; I'm rarely on EQ anymore."<br>
<br>
This question is again unrelated to any of MY previous posts so why ask me?  I ain't the boss of you!  Make up your own mind!<br>
<br>
"Answer each question. I dare you."<br>
<br>
Done.<br>
<br>
"And, yes, I'm very mean. But, I'm only mean to people I believe are inferior and have little or nothing to add to the world."<br>

<br>
I disagree.  People are posting that I wrote things that I did not.  They always fail to present the quote they are referring to when they falsely accuse me I have noticed.<br>
<br>
"A post count is merely a representation, and while you do indeed hold merit in that people with single digit post counts of course hold the same weight as anon's, you should realize, by your own acclaimed wisdom and intellect, that posts don't matter, good posts do."<br>
<br>
Yup that sounds just like what I was saying let me quote myself for a minute:<br>
<br>
Post #1<br>
"Someone with many post is more likely to be known and have build up a reputation as either trustworthy or untrustworthy. With a post of 1 the veracity of the post cannot be determined"  - So you have to actually read the posts to determine anything about them.  The actual number does not determine anything but that posts exist out there.  They do not determine merit.<br>
<br>
Post #2<br>
"My point was that multiple posts let people know a posters consistency and whether or not they are trustworthy. The people who post nonsense are known for it and so that is taken into consideration when evaluating their post as much as the people who write well thought out and mature posts." - So you have to actually read the posts to determine anything about them, etc (that sounds familiar).<br>
<br>
Post #3<br>
"Their trustiworthiness remains a mystery to anyone that does not know them. Can you determine the trustworthiness of anyone you have no experience with in any way, shape or form? Can you tell me whether I am trustworthy or not? Do you have any basis to make that judgement?" - same comment as before, what is so hard to understand?<br>
<br>
I think I will stop there though I could obviously continue.<br>
<br>
"It's apparent you want that. Learn to string together ideas concisely, and not drag on forever, annoying everyone. As it is, you're just begging us to call in the vultures, if only to silence you."<br>
<br>
The writen word remains a poor form of communication.  Many nuances of tone and accent are lost here.  If you think my posts are poorly writen then I will try to improve.  I never did claim I was a superior writer all I did was tell others they were not.  Again it is fautly logic to infer that from those posts.  How can anyone silence me?  You only have power over me if I let you and I do not choose to give you that power. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/bemarr.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=ogma>Ogma</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 42<br> <font color=#E9D756>(10/5/01 11:09:48 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Darue</span><hr size=1> I did re-read the posts as I was starting to think I had said things I had not.  It turns out I never said many of the things that you are accusing me of.<br>
<br>
"Ok..now your down to a he said she said thing about the LD directly from the FIRST FOUR posts. Seeing as how that can be a common excuse, it would be VERY EASY to derive to just watch out for Corgon. PLain and Simple.."<br>
<br>
Did it escape you that 2 different people were posting under the hawaii81an77 username?  At that point who knew anything for sure?<br>
<br>
"So your whole Idea of not listening to posters who have no name on these boards, who happen to be one of the 2k people you havent met in game, who seem to hold no credibilty, can still pretty much sum up what happened in the first post he makes only to be backed on the fourth post by the person he is posting about. Yet you can come here and say it isnt true because YOU have never seen him before, have never seen him post before, have never developed an opinion of him before.? But yet Corgon himself holds most of what was written as valid (minus the infamous LD)"<br>
<br>
Geez, and Nekaih accuses me of not making sense!  Can you please point out to me where I said this part?  "Yet you can come here and say it isnt true because YOU have never seen him"  WTF?  Saying I cannot form an opinion whether it is true or not is not saying that it is NOT TRUE which equals FALSE.  Are you saying that I must believe it is true because it has been posted?  Must I believe it because someone wrote it?<br>

Actually that has never been my point.  My point is and has always been that a post count of "1" lacks credibility.  You cannot assume the opposite is true and pin it on me.  A high post count MAY allow you to form an opinion of someone but I never claimed that was guarenteed either.<br>

This board is a warning, not a court.  Although some have tried to condemn certain &quot;scammers&quot; here (I've done it myself), the most that this board can offer is opinion.

But my advice, from bully to overweight highschool nerd, is to just stay down <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ucattherinevishamberek.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Cattherine Vishamberek</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 10<br> <font color=#E9D756>(10/6/01 10:26:49 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Corgon the thief</span><hr size=1> Hello everyone.  I just have a few quick comments about this whole argument.  <br>
<br>
First: I don't really see how one's sexual preference, the sociological debate on using &quot;ghey&quot;, one's status as a feminist, or one's status as a &quot;meanie&quot; has anything to do with this discussion.  The topic is &quot;is Corgon a scammer,&quot; and then in order to answer that question based on the posts presented, simply &quot;are post counts and credibility related.&quot;  Let's try not to convolute what we are discussing by delving into personal attacks or bringing in topics that have been the subject of long convoluted posts in and of themselves, as they only detract from our ability to answer the real questions in this thread.  If you want to discuss those irrelevant topics, go find the posts where the topics ARE relevant.  I'm sure you'll find them.<br>
<br>
Now on to the questions at hand.  I pretty much agree with both Ogma and his adversaries.  I believe that 1.  In the absence of any personal interaction with a character, prior posts can be used as a means of understanding someone's reliability.  But I do not agree that a poster with less than  32 (or whatever Ogma's was when he started posting in this thread) posts should be automatically disregarded.  Even if you don't have hundreds of prior posts to read to determine indefinitely whether a poster should be believed or not, you can still look at INTRApost characteristics and make your own decision.  <br>
<br>
For example, how mature is the post?  Is the poster objective and fair, or derogatory and condescending?  What kind of posting ethics does this poster appear to have?  <br>
<br>
Ultimately, I advise people to get to know other people for themselves, and then draw their own conclusions.  At the same time, I also find it prudent to at least be WARY of people mentioned on the scammer board.  This doesn't mean you have to be unkind to the supposed scammer, or that you should act paranoid in their presence allt he time, but just keep an eye on your purse just as you would with any other character you do not know.  Being scammed is a horrible thing, and anyone can be a scammer out there...but being scammed by someone you have been warned about because you were too stubborn to heed that warning because of a low posting number is inexcusable.   <br>
<br>
Remember, though the original poster had but one post, other posters, including myself, added reason to be wary of Corgon.  Though currently Corgon appears to have cleaned up his act, as I wrote earlier, this does not mean that one should be entirely trusted due to his cloudy past.  Regardless of post count, if a number of posters appear to have reached a consensus (of course, excluding Ghalewind attempts by one poster to create a consensus all by himself), that would be reason enough to give at least SOME validity to the posters.  <br>
<br>
Still, remember ultimately to base opinions on yoru personal interactions with a player or on evidence you have witnessed yourself, but at the same time do not ignore the valuable warnings you can recieve on this board.<br>

Do you, Ogma, believe that if you tell everyone that post count matters they will believe you?<br>
<br>
Do you, (most of the rest), believe that if you tell him he is wrong people will care?<br>
<br>
To be honest this is meaningless.  This whole thread is meaningless.  If Ogma wants to base credibility on post count, spelling of a persons name, size of their sig, or whatever meaningless piece of superficial information he can garner from looking at a post, who the fuck cares?<br>
<br>
And why do (once again the infamous &quot;rest of you&quot;) want to change his mind?  It is likened to trying to convince someone to get pickles on a chicken sandwich.  Fuck it's gotta be disgusting to eat, but anyone can choose not to.<br>

<br>
If you think /I/ am gay bashing, you need to move your ass out to a city where the population count is higher than five and get out into real modern society.  &quot;Gay&quot; is used to describe things that are out of the norm nowadays, not necessarily homosexuality.  &quot;Faggot&quot; used to mean little chips of rotted wood used to start fires for the hearth, but people started using faggots to burn fires to burn homosexuals, thus the name &quot;faggot&quot; now applies to homosexuals.<br>
<br>
You say I'm homophobic and anti-homosexuality for using a common day colloquialism that now implies &quot;out of the ordinary.&quot;  Why stop there?  Why not say I'm making fun of happy people?  Or maybe perhaps I'm against the decay of splinters of wood when I mention &quot;fag&quot; or &quot;faggot.&quot;  <br>
<br>
I guess we'll never know.<br>
<br>
You're still a fuk-fuk little turd, though.<br>
