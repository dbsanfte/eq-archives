Now the shoe is on the other foot.  Now you are ready, and it is his turn to reject you.  Chances are, he is -not- getting it elsewhere, but is more than content flogging the bishop and rejecting you out of spite.<br>

Obviously, my hitting on pixillated females when playing my male character in game is roleplaying.  First of all, I am not interested in women in real life, but that doesn't mean that my male character cannot be.  In real life, I also do not treat men (or women, obviously) like pieces of meat like Angello treated Zariel.  Plus, Angello's distrust of women since Karisma and Vanessa StClaire is what started his callous SURFACE behavior towards women as we saw in the past.<br>
<br>
Basically, on your logic, all men who play female characters have to be lesbians, and those few women playing male characters have to be gay, else, they are using roleplaying as an excuse to cover up for their true behavior!  *Gasp!*<br>
<br>
That is the most ludicrous assumption I have ever heard.  People roleplay to have an opportunity to have experiences they otherwise do not have in real life.  I can choose to develop my characters however I wish. <br>
<br>
If you have that much superficiality to comment on me as a person, due to the actions of my character, so be it.  I would have thought that people playing an RPG would know the difference between role playing and real life, but I guess some people still don't.<br>
<br>
Secondly, Arikel...when I left that Fear raid to join a Hate raid, I only had about a half hour left to play.  I would have had to have left either way.  Plus, I told my friends on the raid that I would go with them to Hate before I even went to Fear.  But then I was informed that the Hate raid might not even happen at all, so I went to Fear anyway.  I told the Hate Raid that I only had a half hour left, but my friend said to get the teleport up, so when I can log in I might join a pickup group that's already in Hate.  ((Yes back then that wasn't overly taboo)).  Hence was the start of my month in Hate (during which, sadly, not a single piece of Woven Shadow dropped while I was online).  Case in point:  I would not have been in Fear much longer whether I stayed or not.<br>
<br>
About Zariel giggleing:  She certainly did not appear very offended.  And even if she was, she was playful about it.  I'm sorry if my character offended your sense of the kind of person that was cut out for the HOLY STORM.  EXCUSE ME if I was not a perfect angel.  I'm the kind of person that would rather develop a character as I see fit rather than be forced into a mold I did not enjoy.<br>
<br>
Celoria:  Angello hit on god knows how many women, he follows EMarr.  He can't help it hehe.  I am definitely the original Angello (unless there as an Angello before June 1999).  Since I no longer really play Angello and his character has developed in another direction, I can apologize to you for him hehe.  Since we're guildies and all now, I figured that would be a good point.<br>
<br>
As for my personal life with my boyfriend:  IN a way I regret posting this at all, even if it was in response to a thread.  On the other hand, I thank everyone who has put their different thoughts and interpretations into whats going on.  It has helped me, even if I heard things I didn't want to agree with. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ushadowwize.showPublicProfile?language=EN>ShadowWize</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 829<br> <font color=#E9D756>(12/6/01 11:55:26 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Not all men Like Sex</span><hr size=1> You are very welcome.

I don't have any idea what you're talking about.  When I made the comment about roleplaying an asshole, I'm talking about people that are utter shits in game and then say, &quot;hey, don't be mad at me, I'm ROLEPLAYING.&quot;  It has nothing to do with your gender, or the fact you have a boyfriend or whatever.  It has nothing to do with how &quot;nice&quot; you are in real life and how you don't treat women like &quot;pieces of meat.&quot; Well, of course you don't! It's a lot harder to get away with jerklike behavior in real life.  No, be an asshole dork in game and blame it on your roleplaying skills!<br>
<br>
Why don't you load up a monk, work on your FD skill and then go train some female characters over and over?  &quot;I'm a really nice person, but my character was betrayed by a female and now I hate them and cause them intentional exp loss, but don't be mad, I'm just ROLEPLAYING.&quot;<br>
<br>
My very first guild on Norrath was a roleplaying guild (/salute Order of Ascension).  Funny how none of those excellent roleplayers treated anyone badly or caused anyone distress on the pretext of roleplaying.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ukhamelleon.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Khamelleon</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 11<br> <font color=#E9D756>(12/6/01 12:22:19 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Not all men Like Sex</span><hr size=1> That you equate pretending to stare at someone's behind as you run behind them, which I find to be relatively harmless, with training, reveals that you still have no idea what you are talking about Gloriana.<br>
<br>
There is a difference between useing roleplaying as an excuse for illegal game behavior, such as training, and roleplaying a certain type of personality flaw that comes out VERY VERY rarely, since not that many people even role play.  <br>
<br>
Most of my time is spent in OOC talking to my friends, or ooc in groups.  Its not like I hit on random group members , etc.  I think that on the EMarr server, there is a time and a place for roleplaying.  I make a point not to act in character around people whom are not roleplayers because I think its inappropriate (at least that flaw in particular).<br>
<br>
Gloriana, your reasoning is flawed, and your example irrelevant.  Try again.<br>

Angello isnt an asshole at all to my experiance. Hell I even loaned him (the charecter) my erudite mask for a looksy back when they were worth something. <br>

Angello is a person who wanted to roleplay. And at least when I was around was a joy to talk to. He had style. (I also met him before he got his head messed with.)<br>

Maybe people know something that I don't but Angello is good people in my book.<br>

I certainly remember exactly who Kuriohyou is now!  Boy did I hate her!  HAHAHA we couldn't have been worse suited as &quot;husband and wife&quot; .  Didn't we end up duelling in Kelethin?  ROFL<br>
<br>
Gloriana:  That was the first thing you said that actually made sense.  Of course, she did not imply any level of agitation.  She could have sent me a tell saying she found it offensive, and I would have stopped irrespective of roleplaying.  But, she did not give me any indication that this was upsetting her.  Instead, her character just made a few subtle comments and that was it.  The whole ordeal maybe lasted for about two minutes, the remaining time was spent trying to follow her around the zone w/o getting lost.  <br>
<br>
Hey Featherr!  I'll definitely have to look up Snoww when I'm on.  Of course, right now I'm having display problems since the Luclin patch, so who knows when that will ever happen, but...<br>
<br>
For Zariel: My apologies if I offended you for the few moments we interacted.  SHould there ever be a next time, send me a tell to make things clear.  Most &quot;female&quot; characters on EQ don't seem to mind...in fact I've seen many a female dark elf flaunt her &quot;bootie pants&quot; to try to be cute and get free items.  <br>

Shadowize?  You're still here?  Why?<br>

Let's just say some men have values.  Not wanting to have sex doesn't necessarily mean he's already having it elsewhere, it may mean he actually cares about you and wants to be special (as opposed to being *best thing in your life number 26*)<br>
