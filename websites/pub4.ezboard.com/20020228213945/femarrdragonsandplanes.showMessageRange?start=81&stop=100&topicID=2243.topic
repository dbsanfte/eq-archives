<br>
Miblis opinion - Fuck israel, arabs deserve total control over the area cause they too .. once had control there. When the jews lost the area it was cool because it was a time of &quot;conquest&quot;. When the palestines lost it it was way uncool ... well because the arabs lost it.<br>
<br>
<br>
The way i see it is that the majority of the newspapers/tv networks focus heavily on the israeli retaliation on known terrorist/military sites... while when some palestine run amok in the name of jihad killing lots of civilian its not that bad cause they're the poor oppressed nation. <br>
<br>
Both sides are fighting for the land because they have a history there, but imo the palestines are the ones who will not settle for anything short of total, or near total control.<br>
<br>
With your talk about wanting only a piece of the country it sounds to me as you would prefer if they threw a lot of rocks/sand into the ocean building a small island and then called that Israel with the palestines getting all of israel.<br>
<br>
What if the arabs invaded israel. Would the time of conquest be back again ?<br>
<br>
And no, i'm not jewish. I don't know any jews (afaik) and I've never been to Israel.<br>
<br>
Isn't the size of Israel like less than 0.1% of the total middleeastern area ? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uulujainebonelphette.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ulujain Ebonelphette</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_cyanspot.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 82<br> <font color=#E9D756>(8/12/01 9:20:34 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2243.topic&index=82>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: All I can say is...</span><hr size=1> Bubu...<br>

<br>
More or less what I said earlier. Creative cartography in action. Britain gave a sense of nationalism to the Saudi Arabs in order to overthrow the Ottomans and give back Turk &quot;vilayets&quot; to the people who owned them. Without a sense of community or nationalism, the defeat of the Ottomans would not have been possible.<br>
Nationalism, or more correctly, cultural identity had existed in the Levant for years before the British and their overkeen mapmakers but the folk there had dwelt relatively well together. <br>
For evidence of this, look at Communist-era Yugoslavia or the Soviet Union. It took Communism to subdue nationalism latent in many peoples of these two former nations. Things change...the unification of diverse cultures falls to pieces and now we have Chechnya and Bosnia-Hercegovina and Kosovo.<br>

You're joking right? Palestinians get favoured treatment in the world's press over that of the Israeli Hebrew/Jew? <br>
Would you like to prove that? Conspiracy theories aside, a fair deal of the world's conglomerate press associations and newspapers are owned and administered by Jewish people. I'm afraid you're not going to get a real balanced view of the situation there from any newspaper.<br>

So what do all the nations you named have in common (or most). They all have a country of their own - or a region they belong to. Well the Jews area is israel. What other area of the world would you say that the jews should have a nation in, besides israel which is where they have their roots.<br>

I don't see how you can compare the Indians to Israel.<br>
If the Indians had been thrown out of america, was scattered throughout the world and had recently (within the last 50 years) returned to their homeland and was denied the right to live there then you could compare it, but that wouldn't happen in a civilized area like the US right ?<br>

The Indians have not been leading a jihad againts the great american evil, and the americans have not been trying to drive the indians into the pacific ocean.<br>

The first thing I think of is to be cautious. The way it is in Denmark I wouldn't walk too close to a group of turks/arabs just because it has been proven again and again that in groups they can be very aggresive, and quick to get very pissed. If they feel that you looked at them the wrong way theres not much stopping them from drawing a weapon. <br>
<br>
Not all are like this. I have friends with their cultural background that are not like this. But when its proven that the crime/violence rate per turk/arab is a LOT higher than that of the average non arab inhabitant You learn to not trust them before you know them. <br>
<br>
As I see it most of the youth culture among the 2nd generation arabs is VERY macho. Its all about &quot;respect&quot; which you get by harassing/acting tough.<br>
<br>
A lot of the older generation (came here in the 60s/70s are generally well integrated, but their kids and their kids kids are in a huge cultural gap. Can't talk to their parent i guess, and therefore hang out with their friends, and with the fuses being short - and usually in groups of 10 or more it gets out of hand very fast.<br>
<br>
After seeing &quot;danish&quot; girls as young as 13 get group raped by arabs/turks that only brag about it. After seeing their total disrespect for the &quot;danish&quot; girls. They look on them as whores, and usually takes every oppurtunity to show off infront of their friends. After seeing how laws and rules being looked at as &quot;as long as you're not caught, everything goes&quot; and &quot;do what you want as long as you're not 15, cause you can't go to jail&quot; you start to mistrust those with arab/turkish/whatever other country background. <br>
<br>
And no. Frankly I don't care which color you are as long you're trying to be a productional member of the society you live in. But if a large part of a culture are not to be trusted, how do you know who to trust then ? It's not about the color, its about the culture and how you behave.<br>
<br>
If half of the servers haflings were out to pk/steal/ks/scam you .... how would you feel about the other half of the halflings before getting to know them ?<br>
<br>
A group of people will be treated with the respect they earn. Thats why neither Israel or the Palestines have a lot of respect, but imo Israel have been trying FAR more than the palestines to reach a peaceful solution.<br>

Does kicking people out of a country a long time ago give you the right to have it again after they have taken(been given) it back ? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uantheusemarr.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Antheus Emarr</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 116<br> <font color=#E9D756>(8/12/01 6:15:13 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2243.topic&index=84>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: All I can say is...</span><hr size=1> &gt;&gt;&gt;The Hebrews losing to the Assyrians is the biggest non-issue in this entire argument. It doesn't matter that they lived here that long ago, what matters is that for some reason they thought they needed it back. <br>
<br>
So lets say it doesnt matter.  I still dont think you seem to understand.  The land was inhabited by the Arabs, but it belonged to the Brittish.  Now the Brittish were free to do what they wanted with this land, so they split it and gave some of it to the Jews and some of it to the Arabs.  Now the land wasnt that of the Arabs' to begin with because it had been conquered by the Brittish, so according to this statement they have no claim to it either.  Now the only land they could call theirs is that which the Brittish gave to them.  Technically a lot of the land that is inhabited by the Arabs belong to the Jews because they themselves conquered it in the various wars, but they gave an immense amount of it back because they desired peace.  I think it's fairly greedy of these nations to ask for even more, because they had attempted to attain it through warfare, were unsuccessful, and as a result their border should have been even smaller. <br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;Oh, and having some of the most important religious areas in the country wasn't a bad incentive either.... =)<br>
<br>
An incentive?  Of course you would like to have control of your religion's holiest site, that's a given...<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;Um, no, its not their land, but they can go ahead and have a piece of it if they want. You see, thats an open minded answer right there that I just typed. Your answer is that the Palestinians deserve nothing. Oh, provinces don't count as anything either, that is not giving Arabs land. I don't care what your argument is there, but giving out provinces isn't giving out land.<br>
<br>
It's not theirs?  Well according to your whole &quot;conquest&quot; statements, when a land is conquered it belongs to the people who conquered it.  So the land belongs to the Brittish.  Once again it is their land.  Now they decided to give it to the Jews.  Now it is the Jews' land.  I'd like to know how it is not their land.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;Quite the contrary i think it's even worse. The Palestinians only request land, the Jews give them land, more bombings occurr, Palestinians dont look very good do they? I am sure there are many(not all) Arabs that wouldnt stop till all of Israel was theirs, and if fighting continues after agreements have been made it just puts Palestinians in a worse situation.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;What, are you a fortune teller? I think most likely what will happen is that the Arab's will try to work with the land given to them, then Israelis who think that it should all be Israel will suicide-bomb Arab Pizza-shops. That has just as likely of a chance of happening, bud.<br>
<br>
This is a completely hypothetical situation that I proposed given the current situation even after Israelis gave back land.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;Take American technology away from them, and the P.L.O. could fight and defeat the Israelis any day of the week, without the help of the other Arab countries.<br>
<br>
Actually, once again correct me if I am but Israelis have come up with some of the most advanced military technology in the world have they not?<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;Everyone one of you anti Israel &amp; anti Palestinian people just scare me. I think your views are warped and your history is skewed &amp; one sided, to whichever side it may be. <br>
<br>
I know very little about Palestinian history, but very few non-palestinians do.  Just like very few non-jews know about Jewish history, and very few non-americans know about american history.  My views are skewed, and I can admit that, but your very views about &quot;the jews doing exactly what the Palestinians are now&quot; are very skewed as well because it was an incredible minority of Jews that performed these terrorist acts and &quot;threw stones&quot; but the anti-israel performing such acts seem to be in the majority, and if not they are most certainly more of a majority than the Jews of this sort were.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;and lets all agree that nationalism is not a very good thing.<br>
<br>
Really depends.  Nationalism, among other things, is what started world war II, but then again it is also one of the many reasons the Allies were able to defeat the Axis powers.  But generally I agree with you, it is a bad thing. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ucaoilfhionn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Caoilfhionn</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_fire.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Erotic, exotic & a little psychotic</span><br>  Posts: 442<br> <font color=#E9D756>(8/12/01 7:27:30 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2243.topic&index=85>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: All I can say is...</span><hr size=1> Ulujain<br>

I had pretty much resolved to sit out this discussion, and so I shall regarding the main discussion at this time.  Fact of the matter is, the issue is no more likely to be resolved today on these boards, then it is in the actual area that it's occurring.  We can all regurgitate the same arguments over and over and not accomplish one single thing.<br>

You'd help your argument a lot more if you didn't come in peppering your arguments with anti-semitic statements.  I suppose you want the treatment for the palestinians that you aren't willing to give yourself.<br>
According to you, Jews are the sorry excuse for a race that haven't contributed an iota to culture/history/research et cetera, yet control everything, and I suppose they are sitting on the pile of money that none of us can get our hands on (well, I can, of course, as I'm jewish...but I digress).  <br>
<br>
Wait, I hear black helicopters.<br>
<br>
For someone that bemoans the stereotype assigned to the arabs, you sure are slinging some around.<br>
<br>
On a side note, if the arabs don't want to be viewed as kamikaze terrorists, it'd probably help if some of them quit strapping explosives to their chest and walking into lunch time restaurants... <p>Caoilfhionn aka Carrot <BR<

Once again, for those who can't understand, I was *not calling the Arabs anything*<br>
It's called illustrating a concept by giving examples. Most people would understand that, Caoilfhionn...why couldn't you?<br>

<br>
That post (that quote aside) and your OTHER posts had some fairly anti-semitic remarks in them.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> It's amazing how a nation of people like the Hebrews, who've arguably added zero culturally to the world apart from the Bible, can be the centrepoint of so much strife<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Conspiracy theories aside, a fair deal of the world's conglomerate press associations and newspapers are owned and administered by Jewish people. I'm afraid you're not going to get a real balanced view of the situation there from any newspaper<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
You now deny you stated them?<br>
<br>
I could pull more quotes out if you like.  My point is, if it wasn't clear before, is statements against stereotyping are better taken from those not throwing out stereotypical statements against the other side.<br>
<br>
But of course, according to you, this is just my way of turning the argument to the side by throwing out the term &quot;anti-semitic&quot;  Which, you, as stated in a previous post, think is a ridiculous term.  Like it or not, it's well known to mean anti-jewish in this date and time.  <br>
<br>
You aren't talking in third person, you are obviously taking a side.  Many people have come in here and stated a middle view, either admitting they don't understand what's going on or obviously trying not to pick one specific side over the other.<br>
<br>
Sooo....anyway, tell me how you stating that Jews don't offer anything useful to society is any different from someone calling a random Palestinian a terrorist?  I don't see the difference, and THAT'S what I'm calling you on.<br>
<br>
Btw, you go on in another post that their lack of contribution is post-1948.  Might I point out that a large portion of the artists/scientists were killed during the Holocaust and much of their work burned.  I *can* provide names and dates and proof that these exact people were targetted both for their leadership in the community and to eradicate their influence on a nation being converted.  It's a shame we can't know what they might have contributed culturally to your world.  Guess we'll never know, and you've already labeled the survivors as not contributing.<br>
<br>
Maybe you'll see my point, and maybe you won't.  Your words are inflammatory in nature, and you are tossing them out to get a rise, and then bemoaning when the side you've chosen is vilified in any manner.  <br>
<br>
For the record, I don't assume every Arab I see is a terrorist.  I'm pretty sure Mbilis probably isn't a terrorist and at least he has heart in his arguments.   <p>Caoilfhionn aka Carrot <BR<

<br>
I think if you'll explore the site, you'll find that they are neither pro or anti jewish, and as a site are pretty dedicated to reporting things absolutely on the facts.  There are some articles in there that are definitely not geared toward the jewish side, so hopefully this will make you see things a little more clearly.<br>
<br>
Just to make sure, I went ahead and read the remaining &quot;anti-jew&quot; links, most of which I found on arabic sites or obviously anti-semitic sites.  None of them said anything terribly profound regarding this issue, other than to focus specifically on the media that was Jewish owned or run.  <br>
<br>
If you really want to back up your statement on this, I'll ask you a few questions...when you are able to answer them fully, we'll discuss your &quot;jewish controlled media&quot; statement a little further.<br>
<br>

I don’t recall it ever having been done but your welcome to try. As for not being as professional in your next post, could you please clarify. Do you mean not as professional as your clearly biased opinions or your baseless arguments? Do you mean not as professional as responding to Kannibaal with “Hey Idiot” or with a general lack of manners to anyone whose opinion differs from your own? Or do you simply mean that you will come up with a flame?<br>
<br>
Perhaps you should do some research on this board as opposed to ancient territorial disputes. Maybe then you’d realise that despite the flaming that goes that for the most part that people respect others opinions regardless of a personal differing aspect of view. However if my presumption is correct and you do wish to flame then go ahead. I can take it and I sure as hell can give it.<br>
<br>
In recap I stated that you had decided you were right and the Jewish were wrong. I don’t see the Jewish, the Israeli government or the UN posting to this thread. I see you. Therefore I make the accusation that you have decided you are right. Not them.<br>
<br>
As for the time elapsed since this area was in the hands of one people, I think I’d like to be there when you walk into a conference of the combined leaders of each and every country and religion in the world and declaring in your even tones that conquest is now over because a certain period of time has passed. I rather imagine that should you wish to do so you’ll be met by the response that people will declare conquest over when it suits them. i.e. when they’re winning. Which is exactly where you wanted to draw the line.<br>
<br>
Now let me divulge. At the moment the office where I work is in a state of flux. We’re moving to new premises and we have the luxury of being able to “claim our own space” subject to approval. What do you think is going to happen if I take the biggest office in the building, mark out my personal floor space in the corridors and then issue the directive that the office is now settled and nobody has a right to appeal? I’m going to bet the secretaries are going to try and claim the window area by waiting till I have a day off, shifting their desks there and THEN declaring conquest of office space over. Before you accuse me of trivialising the matter I am. I consider warring over land trivial.<br>
<br>
But should that secretary show hostility as the Palestine’s have? Then that secretary will be met with equal force. There will be no negotiations over the photocopier and I think you might find that the Israelis would agree with me on this one.<br>
<br>
In the end the boss is going to walk in (read UN here if you will) and tell us exactly where we’re going to sit and what amenities will be available. This is probably going to be the lousiest area of the office in punishment for not acting like adults.<br>
<br>
Personally I can only hope that the UN goes in and stops your petty squabbling, banishes anyone who wants to carrying on fighting to Antarctica, and that God finally decides that killing people in the name of religion and territory is worthy of a long stint in a hot, fiery place.<br>
<br>
I didn’t look Goldman up. I don’t need to because I’m going to offer you the courtesy of taking your word at the truth. But does a person going into a mosque and killing people justify a Palestinian suicide bomber walking into a pizza hut and killing innocent citizens? No, I think we can agree on that. So why are you even bringing him up if not to defend another’s actions? The fact is that I’m not blaming the Palestine’s for the actions of a minority and I’m not going to condemn the Jews for one fanatic with a gun. The one fact that I am going to respond to is that the only person to walk into this thread with open hostility is someone that clearly sides with the Palestine’s.  If you meet a Jewish person with the hostility that you showed Cao then your not going to go down well on this board. Clearly you aren’t winning this month’s Erollisi Marr popularity contest and that’s nothing to do with the argument you carry but the manner in which it is delivered.<br>
<br>
As Caoilfhionn rightly points out she posted something that is widely acknowledged as the way things were. Whether that’s right or wrong is not her fault but should my boss ask me to sit a history exam next week I should really inform you that I’m probably going to recount history the way it’s been accepted rather then your raving that it’s wrong.<br>
<br>
I understand that this matter is clearly a big deal to you and I don’t expect it to be otherwise. But everyday we watch the news and the Palestine’s have done something else deplorable, which the Israelis have responded to. Or is the media reporting the news incorrectly? Is it perhaps possible that the Palestinian suicide bomber of last week was responding to a similar act of terrorism by the Israelis the week before? Because to most of the world it doesn’t look that way. <br>
<br>
Now it may be that I’m ignorant to the facts, I never discount that possibility. But you’ve really shown me all I need to enable me to make some decisions. Cao, despite having one of the hardest names in the game to spell has shown time and time again intellect and eloquence in her posts and because of that she’s well liked. She posted facts albeit laced with opinion. You lambasted those facts with your opinion but I didn’t see you posting anything, which backed that opinion up.<br>
<br>
So I therefore declare you the loser.<br>
<br>
Who gives me that right? Same person who gives you the right to declare conquest over.<br>

Michael Eisner - Disney and Rupert Murdoch -Newscorp, who owns 20th Century Fox among others. With a bit of searching, I'd guarantee you I'd bring up more.<br>
<br>
I'm anti-Semitic according to our Strangers in Paradise fan here. No...I'm not. I'm anti-Israel. I feel that the State of Israel has no right to exist as it was created for a multitude of reasons, not the least of which was a total disregard to other folk living in the region. Is this anti-Jewish? I despise the term anti-Semitic...look up what Semitic *really* means, not its workaday connotation of Jewish. I have nothing against Jews. It wasn't really the Jews/Hebrews of Israel that were behind Israel to begin with. <br>
Oh, and when you look up Semitic, please don't come back with the descendents of Shem thing. That's folklore. Like the Ishmael thing re: Arabs<br>
<br>
But I dare you to tell me that the Palestinian Arabs have equal rights and freedoms in Israel, that they are afforded the same protections as the Israeli Jew/Hebrew? That's what part of Israel really gets on my nerves...not the Jews, not its US supporters and apple-polishers, but this dreadful inequality that is played out as a bunch of evil Arabs wanting to kill harmless Hebrew/Jew people.<br>
<br>
You don't believe any of this? Feel free to view any and all UN Resolutions issued against Israel and the Amnesty International reports on what goes on there. And yes, you'll get horror stories on both sides.<br>
<br>
Why do I care?<br>
<br>
My background is neither Arab or Hebrew. It is Greek. We are a proud and passionate people, who like the Hebrews, have known the yoke of Rome, the yoke of the Turks and the yoke of Nazi Germany. And, like Hebrews and Arabs, we've had our diaspora as well...and that's a Greek word, for what it is worth. <br>
Put it this way, Katchoo, I know what it is like to be downtrodden and misrepresented.<br>

<br>
You can't seem to grasp that the statement you are making regarding the media is a well-known stereotype, dating back decades.  Like I said, we control all of the banks and hoard all the money too.  And caucasian men can't play sports as well as african men, and arabs are terrorists...and greeks like little boys.<br>
<br>
Here's your definitions, since you asked.  I looked up two words.<br>
<br>
Sem·ite (smt)<br>
n. <br>
1. A member of a group of Semitic-speaking peoples of the Near East and northern Africa, including the Arabs, Arameans, Babylonians, Carthaginians, Ethiopians, Hebrews, and Phoenicians. <br>
2. A Jew. <br>
3. Bible. A descendant of Shem.  <br>
<br>
an·ti-Sem·ite (nt-smt, nt-)<br>
n. <br>
One who discriminates against or who is hostile toward or prejudiced against Jews<br>
<br>
Whether or not you like the term or not, it means EXACTLY what I said it does.  You can argue semantics for days and days, and it's not going to change the meaning of the word, as understood by damn near everyone.  <br>
<br>
By the way, I said your comments were anti-semitic (or anti-jewish if it makes you feel better) in nature, whether or not you are actually either is not something I can determine from your posts.  I do feel you are definitely slanted to the palestinian/arab side, as you've admitted.  Based on that and some of your other comments, I really feel that you fail to see the big picture.  <br>
<br>
I'm well aware of the situation in the middle east, I know the controversy surrounding the occupation of the West Bank.  I can say that I don't agree with everything the State of Israel has done, but then I don't live there.  Regardless, as I've stated before, nothing the Israels have done warrants a man bombing a civilian restaurant at lunchtime, killing children.  Lets assume that the Israelites are TOTALLY in the wrong, the suicidal bombers are STILL wrong.  And even if you can't see it, it doesn't help their situation.  <br>
<br>
Anyway, I'll go back to hoarding my money, and you go back to enjoying little boys backsides, and we can revel in our little stereotypical statements, and make ourselves look even more stupid than before.  <br>
<br>
And for the record, Terry Moore is a damn fine artist, an awesome storyteller, and Strangers in Paradise is about the best fucking comic book I've read.  It's one of two that I read.  He's a super nice guy to boot.  You can visit him at <br>

For many generations, dating back to the Crusades, Israel has been contested by different factions: christian, muslim and jewish.  This is obvious. The people that warred belonged to these religions, but think of this: WHY did they fight?  <br>

Take a short look at the Crusades and you can see that the motives were far from religious.  Take a short look at the Zionist movement, you see the same problem.  <br>
<br>
This is a radical assertion, to some, so look at it this way: deconstruct the term <i>religious violence</i>.<br>
<br>
<i>religious</i> is the sacred, the true, the right, the real beliefs, the path. <i>violence</i> is agressive, harsh, against reason, wrong. <br>
<br>
Then of course the term <i>religious violence</i> becomes a conflict in itself. It's something to muse when we look at certain situations involve religio-political situations such as the Middle East.  <br>
<br>
However, does the bomber muse on such things? <br>
<br>
Does he consider his action religiously violent? No. <br>
<br>
Why? Because there can be no acts of religious violence. The bomber does what he believes is right, and so cannot consider it to be violence.  <br>
<br>
It isn't hard to see why this is important to realize. Until we do, we stand no chance in understanding his motives and how to stop him.  <br>
<br>
This can be applied to any situation where we attempt to attach religious meaning to political actions such as wars.  <br>
<br>
In the situation in the Middle East, my personal feeling is that the situation has devolved into a semi-1984-like state.  To elaborate: Both sides have created a mentality where the other side is the perpetual evil enemy.  The fact that they have differing religions adds to the conflict, but is NOT primary to its continuation.  The continuation is motivated by the government's exortation that the enemy must be wiped out, at all costs. It perpetuates, both sides lose some but not all of their population, just enough to keep the concept of a society/homeland alive.  <br>
<br>
Anyway, you can go on and on, and I've probably gone on too much. Just my take.<br>

You four individuals have made very very impressive arguements for your beliefs. You have stated them clearly concisely and eloquently(that may be redundant forgive me it is almost 3AM). You all have backed up you arguements with FACTS. In these arguements you have done several things in common I will attempt to list them here.<br>
<br>
1) Painted a picture from you point of view.Thats your right and is cool not knocking anyone there.<br>
2)Showed signs of losing your temper.Once again this is cool if you did not I would have blown this entire post off. Your signs of anger show you care what you are talking about.<br>
3)You have enlightened at least one person on a slew of facts though they were presented from your point of view.<br>
4)You have had me look at it from a fascimile of your percpective.(this is a luxury I have has I am not emotionaly involved in this)<br>
5) Graphicly illustrated mans inhumanity to man.<br>
6) Left me right where I started at with the thinking that this situation is just messed up. I believe kids should not have to worry about being blown up by some asshole trying to make a point(hell I do not think anyone should have to worry about it) I also believe people should be able to pray to their God/Gods/Spirits/Fates without some asshole coming in and blowing them away to make his point.<br>
7) Changed eachothers views NOT AT ALL, Why, because you cannot do that for each other. Changing beliefs can ONLY be done by the person HOLDING those beliefs.<br>
<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  You have all done a fine job illustrating the problem that confronts the midle east. The disparate set of beliefs.<br>
<br>
I am not condemning any of the views nor am I endorsing any of the views. I am just pointing out that at this point in time there is no end to your arguement and there is nor end to the conflict in the middle east. There may come a time when some one with different views comes to power and then the opportunity for an end will be present. <p><img SRC="http://www.lof.ukhq.co.uk/sigs/alek.jpg"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ualekzandr.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Alekzandr</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 144<br> <font color=#E9D756>(8/14/01 2:10:24 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2243.topic&index=98>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: All I can say is...</span><hr size=1> ack crap forgot to his spell check on that so feel free to flame my illiterate ass all you want <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> . <p><img SRC="http://www.lof.ukhq.co.uk/sigs/alek.jpg"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uulujainebonelphette.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ulujain Ebonelphette</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_cyanspot.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 89<br> <font color=#E9D756>(8/14/01 6:09:06 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2243.topic&index=99>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: All I can say is...</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>

My wife probably owns every SiP comic made. She has a fair few of the collectors cards too. Comes with managing a comic book store, I guess. I personally think Francine is better looking, but that's me.<br>

Yes, surprise, this has nothing to do with Israel.<br>
