 Some people just preffer public forums  rather than direct tells<br>

 Cut him some slack His attack just one person not your guild. now if he said &quot; Pho crusaders you suck as a guild becuase you have so and so in it&quot; then i would understand, lall he said more or less was Sorry for leaving abruotly but I have a problem with one of the raiders. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/umakril.showPublicProfile?language=EN>makril</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 238<br> <font color=#E9D756>(2/19/02 2:45:07 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3065.topic&index=46>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Well, seeing as how we've already hijacked the thread...</span><hr size=1> So i wanna know this.<br>

What were loot rules..were they decided in advance?<br>
<br>
How many of the group actually wanted riat to have said item?<br>
<br>
How many when it dropped said &quot;i want in on roll&quot;?<br>
<br>
Any one of the above three makes the nbg/ffa argument useless.If loot order is not decided at the beginning of the  group,then it is up to the group as a whole to decide,and if one person don't like it,he can be replaced.<br>

<br>
It sounds like the looting rules were not set out before hand, which does hurt Riat's case, BUT when all of the other casters in the group had the decency to sit out on the roll because of the clear need of the Monk, it makes the lone caster demanding a roll look like very much of a loot whore.<br>
<br>
I've been playing since summer of 99 and to this day 99% of all pick up groups i do have always been understood as NBG groups.  Why do mostly tanks support NBG..because tanks have nothing but armor to rely on.  As soon as casters start condoning the randoming of spells they NEED to all group memebers casters will never win the arguement.<br>

My impression was that it was rolled to the group.  Personally, I believe that melee equipment should go to melee people, but, I also believe in fact.  If it was stated that the other casters sat out, then I apologize for being wrong, but if that isn't the case, don't start assuming.<br>
<br>
But I do agree with you on the spells thing.  If you want to go NBG (and just to make it clear, I am anti-NBG), then randoming of spells to all is only fair.  Some of those spells go for a nice chunk of change.  And don't give me that &quot;well a caster can sit down and scribe the spell, it's the same thing as no-drop&quot;.  Bullshit.  A caster can abuse NBG just as well as a tank.  He can always pretend to be scribing a spell he already has.  I think it would just work out better that if you aren't going to use an item/spell, DON'T ROLL ON IT! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uvelondrasedai.showPublicProfile?language=EN>VelondraSedai</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 186<br> <font color=#E9D756>(2/19/02 8:08:09 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3065.topic&index=50>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Well, seeing as how we've already hijacked the thread...</span><hr size=1>  The moral is that it is always good to check with a group before you start fighting about loot policy. I have seen coutless casters give up melee loot to melees because the group was nbg, in camps that drop NO caster gear and NO spells. I always feel kind of bad, because casters work too, and that 7k might buy them a new robe. Where as it might have only been an 3 damage less than the melee's current wep. I group either way, and either way makes sense.<br>
   As for this post my opinion is that if you didn't state the loot ahead, at least you will never make that mistake again. Though I might harbor hard feelings if a mage walked away with an item I could have used, if it is roll to all it is roll to all. I was in a group where a jade mace dropped but we were not nbg so it was rolled to all. Myself the monk and the warrior were kinda sad to see it go to a chanter, but that is the way it is. A random has no bias, so be it. <br>

<br>
Two things are so clear to me, yet I see these kinds of threads over and over again.<br>
<br>
1.  If you have a dispute with a person who is guilded and can't get satisfaction through direct discussion with that person, seek out a guild officer.<br>
  <br>
(PC is large enough that I think there is almost always at least one officer available.  I've never had a problem that one of their officers wouldn't listen to or help to resolve, even if it wasn't a &quot;PC&quot; group/raid.)<br>
<br>
2.  ALWAYS state what the loot rules are whenever a new member joins the group.  NBG/FFA/Random ALL may be YOUR standard, but they may not be someone else's.<br>
<br>
Two simple concepts that would save a lot of IG frustration.<br>
<br>
Take care,<br>

<br>
Example Shaman Spell Group Regrowth (lvl 56) Ghie had an auction and I lost BUT he was a gentlemen and stopped the auction at 4K.  <br>
<br>
There is another auction going for this spell that has been going on before Ghie's was even posted.<br>
<br>
This spell will prob sell double that of what Ghie sold his for.  Why?<br>
<br>
Because everyone knows how desperate casters are.  Some are gentlemen and others hold the spell up in the air as the Bear Formed Shamans try to jump and get their treat.  They hold on just before the last bear gives up and there isnt a damn thing casters can do about it.  Eventually we need to shell out and get our spells.<br>
<br>
When is everyone going to realise that a caster with a full spellbook will help YOU OUT. Next time you ask for uber buff 1 and cannot have it because caster 2 didnt have the 100k to get it stop and think for a minute.<br>
<br>
You want NBG then stop being so greedy with spell x that drops when certain class y happened not to be there.<br>

Other then that our group is always NbG first and then randoming the stuff that no one really could use as an upgrade.  We don't state that from the beginning I thought all groups played NbG as standerd.

FFS(thanks for this one Kam <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ) even on this board you can't get a definitive answer one way of the other about which should be the standard, NBG or roll for everything.  Why would people keep posting that &quot;all my groups are NBG/Random all, doesn't everyone play that way?&quot;.<br>
<br>
I will try and go slow and use small words:<br>
<br>
Ask. . . . what. . . . the. . . . . loot . . . . rules . . . are. . . when. . . you . . . . join . . . a . . group.<br>
<br>
Failure to do so means you forfeit your right to bitch/piss&amp;moan/whine if you lose something to a random or NBG.<br>

<br>
Dude, what someone charges for loot that no one in their group could use has nothing to do with NBG.  People charge what they can get for loot, whether items or spells.  If you don't want to pay for a spell, go camp it.  And if you insist on crying about NBG, don't bitch when you do camp it and the rest of the group wants to roll on it.<br>

Or did you spend all your life doing the standard Noob zone, LOIO, OT, Karnors, OS, ToV rotation like all the others idiots who play the game and see only about 12 zones in their life.  Sure if you stick to the standard stock zones you will know only about the standard stock drops.  Why don't you climb out of your little safe 5 zone rotation and go explore a bit.  There are quite a few zones out there with a high degree of caster drops.  Luclin is one of them.  SoD has been spending days of days getting drops from one of the new high end zones in Luclin, and its been an excellent mix of pure caster vs. tank gear..most with better stats than some of the crap quests from velious..so maybe if you took a little time to learn the game and the zone you would know there are zones with just as many caster drops as tanks..<br>
<br>
Or are you just to lazy to go look for them?<br>

Good response though, don't deny someone's right just say THEIR guild has been in &quot;one of the new high end zones&quot; that has a &quot;ecellent mix of pure caster gear vs. tank gear....&quot;<br>
<br>
Didn't see ya add to the list of zones with more caster gear.<br>
<br>
I guess if I wasn't so much of a n00b I'd know what zone you're talking about?  But then if you actually stated a zone you'd lose the argument, wouldn't ya?  Can't let that happen.<br>
<br>
Get defensive and insult me some more please without actually rebutting the statement, I enjoy it.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

So what if we got a nice thing going..the stuff that drops is starting to show up on Allakazams and eventually it will be a freakin madhouse just like OS and KC became a few months after Kunark, or Velks in velious.  <br>
<br>
No shit Luclin isn't a zone, read above reason why I'm not going into more detail, I like being able to hunt in realtive peace with my guild and actually get enjoyment from the game without the impending rat race that is sure to ensue later.<br>
<br>
As for the insults..hey you might want to review your original post I think it was you who first replied with the term &quot;moron&quot; making this a glorious rant and flame.  And me? &quot;Uber&quot;?  I hope not thats the last tag I ever want associated with my name.  I'm just a happy monk who enjoys pulling..seeing the zones, grouping with friends, and an occasional shiny new item..whether for me or a friend.  I'm far from ever considering myself &quot;uber&quot;.  That was your term.  Frankly..If I ever become &quot;uber&quot; someone please shoot me becuase it means that the fun will be gone from the game and it has become a mindless grind of the same ole crap.<br>
