It's about the closest I could come to the topic I'm looking to address.  If this IS the wrong place to put this, please delete it, move it, let me know, or something.  =)  Now, on with the post!<br><br>Well met.  I'm Lalolil Ozilamya -- currently 41 Bard, officer of Archeron's Blades, and  just all around wanderer of Norrath/Luclin.  I've got just under 2 years of play experience under my belt, seen a good bit of what the game has to offer, but have yet to get heavily involved with Raids.  Eventually, I plan to do my fair share of leading them, planar, dragon, et cetera.<br><br>What I come here looking for is any tips on where to get started with this.  Obviously, I need to get in on quite a few raids before I go trying to lead them, however, I'm also looking for a good leader or two who'll take me under their wing, and teach me a bit of what they know.<br><br>Being that this is my first post at EMarr, I hope to get to talk to many of you a bit more in the future, and get to know a good many of you.  Thanks for those of you who've taken the time to read this; doubly so for any help yet to come.<br><br>--Lalolil Ozilamya <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uzoldarf.showPublicProfile?language=EN>zoldarf</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 51<br> <font color=#E9D756>(1/16/02 11:20:04 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=931.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Raid Leaders:  A little help, if you please.</span><hr size=1> Guild raids, or pick-up raids?  You'll find the latter considerably harder than the former...<br><br>At your level, I recommend you just grab a few groups of your guildmembers and raid an under-used zone, with the intent goal of killing the &quot;boss&quot; mob.  You'll get quite a bit of practice in the art of coordinating groups.  Start out with something you couldn't possibly fail at, like killing xalgoz in kaesora, and work your way up.  You'll learn more by doing than by seeing.  Much more.<br><br>As for good raid leaders, there are quite a few... Jexielia will probably be the one I'd recommend, from what I've read and what I've seen first-hand.  Still, I think you'd learn more trying your own raids.  After you level up a bit more, get into a pick-up naggy or vox raid.  After you've got a bunch of those under your belt, try leading one yourself.  From there work your way to the planes.<br><br>-Zoldarf <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/usalenie.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Salenie</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 165<br> <font color=#E9D756>(1/17/02 11:54:57 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=931.topic&index=2>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Raid Leaders:  A little help, if you please.</span><hr size=1> I would agree with Zoldarf.  As a neonate raid leader myself the best teacher I have seen is experience.  Therefore....<br><br>1.  Raid raid raid.  Go to dragon raids if the leader will let you (most likely you'll need to get to 45+ before you can do that).  If Archeron's Blades currently has raid leaders, go with them.  You won't be able to physically go to the planes until you are 46th level so that is out, but you can see a lot of it by being at the SoRo spires when a PoH / PoA raid is about to kick off.  Tag along on VS raid.  Ask the raid leader if you can observe if you are actually going to be near the fighting so they know what's up.  Be quiet, stay out of the way, listen and watch.  Do NOT ask questions of the raid leader at the time of raid. They are in 3 kinds of /tell hell. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br>2.  Practice Raid.  When you have a clue what is going on about raids, Run a sample one.  Your first action doesn't have to be pulling the General for the Rogue Epic in Kith.  Hell, for your first time consider something small and easy.  Running two or more groups is a new experience compared to running one group.  Might want to start in something easy like Nektulos Forest pulling guards (mostly green, a few blues to low 40s I believe).  The question is to learn the dynamics, not score uber loot.  Practice raid tactics like having a puller hand off mobs to a main assist.  Practice over pulls and have the puller specifically pull five mobs so your enchanters/bards can practice raid level mob control, your MA can practice priority targeting, and your raiders can learn to assist one target only.<br><br>If your practice group gets bored and undisciplined in a simple raid, you might have the same problems with them when they get to the real thing.  Just because someone is 50+ doesn't mean they know to only assist when the MA calls it, to keep the leader channels clear of needless spam, or will follow simple instructions.  Trust me on this one. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br>3.  Do a practice raid with a real threat level.<br><br>Take your low/mid 40s into Kedge, Mistmoore, or what have you.  Try pulling inkies in Kithicor at night.  Go into the Qeynos sewers.  The skills you learned in Step 2 will now spell the difference beween you totally owning the zone or the zone totally owning you.<br><br>* * *<br><br>My first raid happened by accident.  Two guilds got together to do Kedge, and the three people in those two guilds who had actually run raids before all failed to show do to various RL situations.  As the senior officer between the two guilds I picked up the raid.  The MA has never been an MA before, the puller was an accomplished puller but had never been in Kedge before.  Most of the people in the raid had little actual multi-group raid experience.  We had enough for three groups.<br><br>Over the course of the next 5 hours we went slowly and learned to do it together.  I harassed these poor people about using assist.  We had our screw ups (mistargets breaking mezzes, pets out of controls, puller dying) and I switch people around in groups too much breaking the flow at first, but we learned.  By the end of it, we got as far as Phinney's room.  We killed a mini-boss.  It was a thoroughly good time and we all learned a lot.  That's why I hope you'll have as your first experience. <p>Salenie Mithrilweaver<BR>Proud Member of <a href=" http://www.clanbattleaxe.com">Clan Battle Axe</a><BR>Ally of Vivix Protectorate<BR>Koada'dal, Magician, Grandmaster Smith, and Master of All Languages<BR>RL life pending...</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/umelifleur.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Melifleur</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 50<br> <font color=#E9D756>(1/17/02 12:10:15 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=931.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Raid Leaders:  A little help, if you please.</span><hr size=1> If your guild does not raid, join Sagemon/Tormentcia/Vetinari pickup raids.

It is a thankless job and can become quite confusing if your not organized. All the posts I read above have great info. Read them. Pick up raids are tough. Guild raids are easier to manage but if your guild is not strong enough then it defeats the purpose. I would welcome you to join some of our raids if you like. We do have a 45 level min requirement on all non planar raids and 50 for the planes. Contact me in game. We raid about 4 times a week sometimes 5. Usually on Tues, Wed, Fri, Sat, Sun. You are more than welcome to tag along and I go over what I am doing and why. <br>Or I can send you a raid guide by e-mail should yuo want one. <br><br>Tyym Datoolmantaylor<br>Officer/ Raid Leader<br>Greylords<br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm13.showPrevMessage?topicID=931.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm13.showNextMessage?topicID=931.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=931.topic&index=4><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/gfx/addReply1.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm13.emailToFriend?topicID=931.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm13.threadControl?topicID=931.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/deleteThreadFire.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm13.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=931.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm13.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=931.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub4.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="emarrmessageboardrules">Message Board Rules<option value="emarrlinks">Links<option value="emarrupcomingmmorpgs">Upcoming MMOG's<option value="emarrfrm18">America Under Attack<option value="emarrfrm19">Dark Age of Camelot<option value="emarrgeneral">General<option value="emarrfrm17">Funny Stuff<option value="emarrbazaar">Item Bazaar<option value="emarrscrollsnspells">Spell Bazaar<option value="emarrfrm15">Shiny Things<option value="emarrfrm14">Bargain Basement<option value="emarrdragonsandplanes">Rants and Flames<option value="emarrfrm13">Dragons and Planes<option value="emarrroleplaying">Roleplaying<option value="emarrroleplayingoocforum">Roleplaying -
