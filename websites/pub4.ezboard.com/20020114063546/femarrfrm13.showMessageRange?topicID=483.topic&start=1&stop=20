However, it's basically a &quot;gentlemens agreement&quot; so to speak on VS and I believe someone in DG might have the rotation list.  While it is correct that the way to get on the list is KS the mob .. how many pick up raids are really that organized to get it together before the pro's get to it?  I don't think I'd want to be there when they showed up .. there could be some real hard feelings there.  VS at this time, isn't meant to be a pick up raid mob.  There are plenty of Planes and other places, like The Hole or HS that can be raided, without stepping on anyone's toes. <p>Tormentcia

However if a pick up raid were to step in and manage to take out VS then that is not?  /boggle  I say if you can get a force together and do it then more power to you.  No one on this server or even in this whole game across all the servers has any more right to a mob than anyone else.  If the only way to get in the rotation is to KS it, then well, expect the chance it may be ks'ed.  Plain and simple.  Don't whine and cry about it and try to KS someone else's.  Though I agree that once in the rotation you should abide by the rotation guidelines, it's the most fair and straightforward way to do it without stepping on someone's toes imo.  Now granted, trying to get enough peeps together who are capable of taking out VS before someone on the rotation does will be quite the feat.  However, once on the rotation then not only have you secured a spot there but you will be able to then post the pick-ups spot on the rotation on the boards here and have enough signed up beforehand.  Sounds like a good plan at least in theory to me.  I'd much prefer going on a pick up raid in hopes of getting some ultra rare epic piece than have to buy it off someone for the ungodly amount of 50k just because they can take out the mob and want to sell it to procure guild funds.  Sorry but that just makes me sick.  I never have more than about 1k in the bank because I spend my time playing the game instead of sittin in Ebay commons trying to sell the caster cloak I rolled on because I felt I needed the money more than the caster needed the cloak.  I'm sure if I sold all the stuff I've acquired over the course of this game I'd have well over at least 30k in the bank right now.  However, I'm one of those goofy types that give away stuff to peeps who can use it.  But anyway, that's a whole nother can of worms there heh.  I say if you can do it mano then go for it!  Not everyone's so self centered that they're willing to leave the guild they love just so that they can be &quot;uber&quot; and automatically be in the &quot;rotation&quot; by default :P  Just my leetle 2 cp <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Couple months back we tried hosting a pickup raid on Fear.  Well, not only did another guild show up about an hour before (who I will not mention as to not start any useless flaming), but one of them said that they were aware of our raid from the boards here and planned theirs anyway (after seeing ours).  So, after much debate on who should go up, the leaders decided to try a joint raid.  My god, that was the biggest pile of bodies I've ever seen hehe.  It went from a well organized pick up raid to complete and utter chaos.  Groups were made and had to be remade a couple times I think before we entered because of it all.  Though after some Shriners came and helped clean up the mess, those that stayed ended up having a good time and some good drops.

It's not fun when it happens because you were planning one thing, and for someone to jump your plans is very rude.  <br>
<br>
You do make a good point about the VS rotation.  If a pick up got into the rotatation, they would have to remain in the rotation -- it's not a one time thing.  We all know that it is very difficult for a pick up raid to begin on time and with the type of organization you get from the guilds that are on the rotation.  If a pick up raid is going to KS VS, and I'll even go so far as to say they're successful at doing so, they (i.e. the raid leader of the pick up raid) will have to commit to being in the rotation and taking down the mob, just like the guilds that are in it already.  Personally, I don't see that happening.  Yes, whacking VS once or twice would be fun, but the people on that rotatation are there because they can do it on a regular, consistent basis.   <p>Tormentcia

Lets say the whole raid gets wiped by VS .. who is going to be there to save you if you can't get back?  Most likely, the guild you want to KS.  No one on pick up raids likes it when their plans get jumped by someone who saw the plans on the board or even by someone who didn't .. at what point can anyone complain that they are mad for being jumped on a Plane, and then turn around and do it on the rotation for VS?  Seems like a double standard to me.   <p>Tormentcia

However, I have to agree with Darmu on the KSing issue.  If VS pops, and someone can get there first with a pickup group and take him down, there is nothing wrong with that.  The root of the DG/PC dispute was *not* that DG KSed PC, but rather that DG was already part of the rotation and was going out of turn.<br>
<br>
It would be considered good manners to tell the guild that is next in the rotation that you plan to go for VS.  But you certainly don't have to have their permission.<br>
<br>
It is a very different matter to say that a pickup group would be added to the rotation if it managed to kill VS.  Who would you say is in the rotation?  A pickup group?  40 players assembled by Darmu using a message board and in-game tells?  Darmu himself?<br>
<br>
Sooner or later, someone is going to take down VS with a pickup group.  It will be interesting to see how things work out. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uparum.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Parum</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 281<br> <font color=#E9D756>(7/29/01 8:52:51 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: how many people are interested in a VS pick up?</span><hr size=1> Tormentia - The reason people got mad at DG was because they were *already* in the rotation and were not up to kill him, yet did anyways.

I wish ye the best of luck.. Ill be very impressed to see that.. I dont think any of the guilds in the rotation will be pissed about it.. as long as you dont pull over a guidl thats buffing for it.. ahem.. nuff sed. <p><img src=http://members.home.net/barridor/Barridorsig.gif>

Pick up raids simply are not as organized as the large guilds that can quickly get people together.  If a pick up manages to do it once, great.  However, who is going to keep that spot?  To the people in the rotation, they're not doing it with the intention of just doing it once .. they're earning their spot on a regular rotation.  I can already hear the bitching when the pick up raid gets KS'd .. it'll be the same bitching we hear when someone else is on a Plane.   <p>Tormentcia

In addition to pickup groups, there are several up-and-coming guilds that are eyeing VS.  Before long, the rotation is going to be so large that it may just collapse.  The one thing that may save the rotation is that VS is no longer an &quot;uber level&quot; mob, and the top guilds really don't have a lot of need for him.  On the other hand, VS is necessary for the wizard epic quests, which is apparently what led to the DG/PC blowup.<br>
<br>
As for whether a pickup group would become part of the rotation, my bet is that it will depend a lot on who is leading the group.  Someone like Gorndax probably has the stature to claim a permanent spot.  Someone like Darmu would have a lot harder time getting recognized as part of the rotation. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm13.showMessageRange?topicID=483.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm13.showMessageRange?topicID=483.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm13.showMessageRange?topicID=483.topic&start=61&stop=65>4</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm13.showMessage?topicID=501.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm13.showMessage?topicID=32.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm13.emailToFriend?topicID=483.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm13.threadControl?topicID=483.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/deleteThreadFire.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm13.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=483.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm13.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=483.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub4.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="emarrmessageboardrules">Message Board Rules<option value="emarrlinks">Links<option value="emarrupcomingmmorpgs">Upcoming MMOG's<option value="emarrfrm16">The Emarr Quadrant<option value="emarrfrm18">America Under Attack<option value="emarrfrm19">Dark Age of Camelot<option value="emarrgeneral">General<option value="emarrfrm17">Funny Stuff<option value="emarrbazaar">Item Bazaar<option value="emarrscrollsnspells">Spell Bazaar<option value="emarrfrm15">Shiny Things<option value="emarrfrm14">Bargain Basement<option value="emarrdragonsandplanes">Rants and Flames<option value="emarrfrm13">Dragons and Planes<option value="emarrroleplaying">Roleplaying<option value="emarrroleplayingoocforum">Roleplaying - OOC Forum<option value="emarrscammeralert">Scammer Alert<option value="emarrsignaturecorner">Test Forum<option value="emarrreallife">Real Life<option value="emarrothermmorpgs">Other MMOG's</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#E9D756>- </font><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/bemarr>Erollisi Marr, The Queen of Love</a><font color=#E9D756> - </font><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm13>Dragons and Planes</a> <font color=#E9D756> - </font><br><br> <br>
