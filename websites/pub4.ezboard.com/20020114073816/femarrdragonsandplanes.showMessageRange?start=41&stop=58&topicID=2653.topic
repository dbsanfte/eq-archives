For a point of reference, I do believe *I* was the cleric Lukaria placed on ignore for whatever reason she chose. I care not. She started her camp based on the assumption that Darrikan or whatever his name was, *gave* her the camp after RF was dead. Point of reference #2. Darrikan's control of the camp poofed the moment RF went down. Etiquette states that first into the lair, has it. If I remember correctly, *you* were still looting your corpse from the *first* wipe out, while RF was being killed. I helped with RF going down, then plopped down on the camp. <br>
<br>
    Shortly after I'm accosted in tells with, &quot;What do you think you're doing?&quot; My response...&quot;What does it look like?&quot; Of course by now Lukaria has her body back and is sitting in the lair with a few little people. Few minutes later, few tells later, I get a tell from Gywenth who promptly tells me she doesn't appreciate my being in the lair and some other such hot air. The woman was nowhere in sight, and not guilded with Lukaria, so at this point I'm a tad lost as to who she is and what exactly, her stake in this particular incident is.  <br>
<br>
   At this point I start conversing with Lukaria, and asked her if she is familiar with the fairly accepted etiquette rules that have applied to RF since epics came out. She was not, so I was kind enough to inform her. She apparently didn't agree, at which point she started calling me dude, and telling me to chill out. I then got rash and told her if I logged in, and she wasn't in the lair nor could be seen clearing fgs or gathering to clear them, I was taking the camp. <br>
       <br>
      I then left the camp to her amidst more tells to leave the camp for her, and she's been waiting 3 days or whatever for it. I then contact Gywenth to find out just what she has to do with this, and she tells me the camp is promised to Lukaria first, her next, and Dreadina after that. I was kind enough to inform her the same thing I did Lukaria. If the camp was empty, no one was clearing fgs or gathering to clear fgs, I was moving in *with* or *without* them having their epics. Of course she then informed me that if I did as such, she would steal it from me. <br>
<br>
   So, that is as you say, that. Btw, that was also me that was moving into the lair as she came back from LD. I *did* have a group with me to take it Lukaria, but I was nice enough to leave *again*, while listening to some halfwit shouting in ooc at me. <br>

<br>
Not sure why you posted here.  I certainly never mentioned your name here on this board.  Its nice that you admitted everything though.  Makes life much easier for me.  <br>
<br>
As for RF etiquette, I find that funny Draelyn.  Considering the fact that the etiquette you listed to me included the following : if you go LD even for five minutes or leave for any reason, I shall take your camp.  <br>
<br>
I was there when RF went down, I claimed the camp immediately after RF went down, and on top of that, you  knew full well I was taking the camp after Darikan.  <br>
<br>
The halfwit, as you chose to call him, that yelled in OOC happened to be a guildmate who was there in the lair at the RF camp with me, and of course, remained there until I was safely back online.  He was responding to your nasty ooc's regarding my LD and reappearance before you could claim the RF camp, if you bother to recall that.  Which, I might add, I came back online just as you were entering the lair.  Which was cleared of FG's.  I shall also add that at this point the camp had been mine for over 12 hours.  Is that etiquette Draelyn?  To take an RF camp while the cleric is LD when a guildie of hers is there holding the camp???<br>
<br>
I never asked anyone to send you a tell regarding the camp. I never named you on this board.  I never flamed you on this board.  I never even said much to you at all, despite the fact that you were being completely rude to me. <br>
<br>
There was no &quot;being nice&quot; and leaving as you put it Draelyn.  You had no right to the camp, it was being held by me and a guildie/group at ALL times, even those few in which I went LD.<br>
<br>
Btw, if the cleric goes LD, the camp does NOT become open if a group/guildie is holding it.  Just thought I would let you know that.  I questioned a GM shortly after your attempt to take my camp in order to clarify as I was having some minor LD problems.  That was the response from the GM.  Of course, had RF popped and PC not been able to take him down within a short time, another cleric would have been contacted.  In this case, Gywenth.  Why?  Because I told her I would.<br>
<br>
Regardless, people are right, the list thing would not work, as most people aren't really all that honorable.  I think I learned that on this camp.  Its funny, but never in all my eq time have I ever had as many headaches, rude tells, rude people, and incredibly weird things happen as during this stupid RF camp.<br>
<br>
In conclusion, I did my part Draelyn.  Don't come to this board and complain about me when you are the one who was in the wrong.  Especially as I never even mentioned your name here.  You did it all on your own.<br>

personally ive had it with this camp.  Never before have i seen so many ppl ready to screw themselves over for a computer game....<br>

I would rather go have fun else where, if getting the best weapon for my character means constant argueing, fighting for a camp and ppl begin pissy at me on MSG boards....then the hell with the weapon.<br>

Hell, I might have sent him a tell once a day to see how things were going, but I sure as hell wasn't on 40 hours straight which you implied.<br>
<br>
   Two, you are right, I openly admitted that it was me you were talking about. Why? Because after the 3rd post in 3 different subjects where you were nice enough to describe the situation, while keeping me anonymous, I finally got tired of reading it and figured hell, lets just throw it all into the open.<br>
<br>
   For another point of reference, I don't hate you, I never had a problem with you until I had to deal with this stupid list you three imposed. As soon as I heard that, thats when I got mad. As for telling you I would take the camp if you went ld? Happened, I said it. I did however, not say I would do it within 5 minutes. I said if you were ld for a unreasonable about of time...ie:20 minutes? Obviously all computers don't load up super fast, and not all isp's are reliable, so for me to expect anyone and everyone to return from ld within a 5 minute time period would be absurd. <br>
<br>
   Answer me this honestly, do you think its fair to have an fd monk camping the lair for some cleric who's not even online? No, I don't and I don't think most of the cleric population on emarr would either. Now I know Mordac was a mage or a wizard, I don't remember which exactly, but if he was up there alone, camp was open in my estimation. He didn't need the piece, he couldn't trigger RF unless he had the pearl, and most non clerics don't think to do the quests up to the pearl to chain for guild clerics because no one in their right mind wants to camp RF for someone else anyway. <br>
   <br>
    Headaches are part and parcel of RF camp. I dealt with them the first time I camped him, and I expect to deal with them again if I decide I want to kill more braincells by sitting and staring at a wall. Deal with it.<br>

What do I care?  Its a horrid camp and a game to boot.  If a guild has three clerics that need the spawn and are keeping it for over a week, it simply makes no difference to me one way or another.  I actually would have preferred to not have this camp, I have a small child at home to care for in addition to a home business.  <br>
<br>
You're right Hoppkins, the list thing sucks, the camp thing sucks, but I think you're wrong in jsut one thing.  I've met lots of clerics who are very nice and very honorable, and wouldn't steal a camp from another person.  <br>
<br>
Draelyn, you did say 5 minutes.  I even mentioned that within guild chat.  And yes, I was LD for almost 20 minutes.  Thats a reasonable amount of time, considering a guildie was there holding the camp for me.  Had RF popped at that moment, he had my number to call and see what the difficulty was and if another cleric should be alerted.  I never stated you gave Darikan a tell every hour, however, I was told that you checked roughly every hour to make sure he was there.  Putting that aside, you could have asked my guildie, I'm sure he would have told you I'd gone LD and would be back shortly.  I'm even sure he wouldn't even had minded you waiting to make sure.  Regardless, your being angry/irritated/upset/whatever at not having the camp/the fact that I thought a list might be easier on other clerics is NOT a reason to attempt to take it when it was being held.  Whatever, I'm done with this thread.  I'm done with this subject. <br>

<br>
The list idea was just that an idea.  It was meant to further discussion about a better way of dealing with ragefire and the onslaught of clerics that need him.  All I've heard is, the list won't work, this is the way it has been done this is the way it should be done.<br>
<br>
We 3 did not impose a list on anyone and the fact of the matter is if no one is there then its not camped.  Never did we say that a camp would be "promised" to someone.  What we did say was that we would NOTIFY each other as a courtesy.<br>
<br>
Why will I still care about this after I have my epic, because a lot of my friends are clerics and will still have to go through the same thing, when I'm sure if we think about it a different solution could be thought up, but too many people don't care and prefer to do things the way they have been doing them just because that's the way they've been doing them.<br>
<br>
In conclusion, I wish all the clerics the best of luck with this and will continue to think of creative ways to not make this so painful to so many.  It's a pain in the ass and truly makes you realize who your friends are in the end.<br>

<br>
Get the support of the top guilds on the server.  Basically, if the top guilds don't buy off on it, it won't happen.<br>
<br>
Designate a &quot;list coordinator&quot; similar to the VS/Trak rotation person.<br>
<br>
Advertise that there is going to be a list, giving people 1-2 weeks to ask to get on the list.<br>
<br>
To get on the list, you have to have your pearl.<br>
<br>
The initial list would be based solely off of level.  The 60's first, and then work your way down.  Once the initial list is made, any new clerics would go to the end of the list regardless of level.<br>
<br>
The cleric on top of list is still responsible for the camping of Ragefire, but the camp can be held by guildmates/friends to allow for sleep.<br>
<br>
Once Ragefire spawns, the cleric in question has 4 hours to kill Ragefire or the spawn goes to the next cleric in line.<br>
<br>
As clerics get their epic, they notify the &quot;list coordinator&quot; ASAP in tells or by posting on the board.  They also are responsible for notifying the next cleric (or guildmates of the next cleric) that their turn is up.<br>
<br>
<br>
These are all just suggestions, but it might work if clerics of Erollisi were to agree to it.<br>

Either way, flaming someone's spelling (more often than not a typo) online is a cliché, like mentioning Hitler in a post and unfortunately marks you as an Internet newbie. It also proves you have nothing to say.<br>

<br>
It only makes the world a kinder place if they do.<br>
<br>
Ragefire does get in the way of the Paladin/Warrior/Bard epic a bit due to the whole Naggy thing, but thats a different thread.  <br>
<br>
I have a real goofy idea.  And yes I know it wont work and no one will do it.  Why not have every cleric in the ragefire camp and when he pops, random to see who gets him.  Then if you need to go to sleep, go to sleep, if you need to go to work go to work, but if you are on when he pops and are paying attention.  Maybe 5,15,30,45 minutes to get in on the random then you get to do the quest, and everyone whos hanging out gets to help with the fight.  I could see it as a group of 6 clerics killing the FGs instead of &quot;/guild the giants are popping the giants are popping&quot;  <br>
<br>
I know it wouldnt work, I just thought it would be an interesting thought.   I know there would have to be a time limit where the people would have to be there a certain amount of time before they could random.  Like killing a giant spawn + 4 hours or something like that.  And make the character (cleric) be there and responsive while they camp. <br>
I hear they do something like that for Duke basketball tickets.  72 hour campout and they do random check ins to make sure people are there.  Then whoever is there after the 72 hours gets in on the raffle for student tickets.  <br>
