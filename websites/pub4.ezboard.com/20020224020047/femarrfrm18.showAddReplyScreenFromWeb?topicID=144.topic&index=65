The problem today is noone can explain why something is wrong without playing the race card..<br>
<br>
If we would all stop holding on to that card as our way to debunk arguements and realize that today espically people make judgements on real life things that have happened to them more than from old sayings and hearsay ... <br>
<br>
Like Poppen I live in the south , Georgia actually, I have seen all sorts of stuff that people have labled Racism , and today espically in my view ( which i could be wrong on) the word racism is just said to try to win a arguement that one cant win with other examples.. <br>
<br>
Do me a favor , for everything you think is racism , look for a example of the oposite .. I bet you will find it .. <br>
<br>
ex  The black people are poor and downtrodden and live in rundown cities and cant get good jobs cause of racism ... look around with open eyes and you will see the same for white, red , green blue yellow and all the other colored people in the world..<br>
<br>
Win a arguement with facts , Not a race card.. <br>

I grew up in the South and during my 30 years alive I have made and kept many many black friends. In fact, I've never even called them black becuase I don't notice anymore. I take extreme offence to your childish generalization and your obvious ignorance. You are screaming about stereotyping when in fact you are guilty of the worst by far in this thread. Next time you plan on posting mindless crap like that you really should better evaluate your own words. Any respect I may have had or any worth I may have seen in your posts and this thread was shot to hell by that last post. You had a chance to get some good points across here but you blew it by playing a race card that just doesn't cut it anymore, and by attempting to generalize and classify when you yourself are ranting against it. Not good bro you don't win an argument by becoming that which you rail against.</font color><br>
<br>
Did I say all white Americans?  It's people like you who don't READ, that come in here and turn 5 or 6 more people against me.  Read my posts, so I am not misinterpreted, ok?<br>
<br>
Don't use the bullshit excuse of "oh you had good points, etc etc etc, and now I disagree because of..."...you're like everyone else here.  Am I suddenly picking out racists left and right?<br>
<br>
If I had good points, I had good points.  Just because I made a semi-generalization by saying a lot of Americans are scared of black people, or think they are less intelligent...which unfortunately is TRUE (that a lot of people think that), doesn't mean my points are suddenly invalid.<br>
<br>
Don't just hop on the band wagon like most everyone else here.  I am very confident with every word that comes out of my mouth, and every explanation I throw up onto this thread.  Try not to be like these other people, Poppen.<br>
<br>
Eltherion, you are always one of wise words.  It's a shame others don't post like you and Arnwolf do.  Very classy individuals (and no, I am not being sarcastic).  I welcome any debatable comments from either of you two.  Hopefully others can approach this debate with the same type of attitude, unlike the way Kerryn has, and the way Makril originally approached it.<br>

You sure don't seem to be picking on a few there.  Your statement is a very broad and general statement.  Forgive me..but a racist and stereotypical one as well and I'm not gonna accept the idea that now since you just suddenly decide it was only meant for a &quot;few white Americans&quot;, that its ok to let it slide.  You sure didn't say it that way.  And you are still using the race card for its shock value only.

Well hell, you can turn any of my sentences against me, can't you?  I didn't say all, I didn't say few, as a matter of fact, I was very vague.  I wasn't very general at all.<br>
<br>
Want me to rephrase?  I don't know whats so offending about that.  I am not saying that white people are discriminating against the blacks, which a lot of people think is still happening.  I don't think thats happening any more.  However, I certainly think that MANY white people are scared of blacks, and many (before meeting these people and realizing they are like everyone else, if not more intelligent in a lot of situations) think that they are less intelligent.<br>
<br>
This is damn true, and I am not ashamed to say it.<br>

<br>
Let me tell you this, you come across as hostile and you support the Palestine regime. ergo. you just come across as another hostile arab. If it's a fact it's not racism. Only the manner in which it is displayed makes something racist.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> This is a textbook case of racism.

Do you just...walk by them and go to the dairy section where you were headed....<br>
<br>
Nah, you think about those people. What kind of people they are. You think about the suicide bombings....at least for a split second. You think about Osama Bin Laden, and his blowing up American Embassies....you think about that.<br>

You don't just walk by another family shopping at a grocery store.<br>

<br>
No it's not interesting. It's you thinking you have justified calling me racist by one statement, and that statement<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> you think about that.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->makes you the worlds first confirmed psychic. I went to a school in Manchester full of muslim and black families. I grew up learning about Diwali and Eid ( I apologize for my ignorance of not knowing how to spell eid ) surrounded by muslim people and not once did I think of bombings. The first time I thought about suicide bombings was when Martigan started his post on suicide bombings and you piped in with your justification then too. Want me to tell you what really interests me?? Are the suicide bombers thinking this as they walk into that crowded restaurant &quot;They all hate me, they all think of me as an Arab bomber&quot; Are THEY all as psychic as you are?<br>
<br>
You should have just stated in Martigans thread that whilst you normally supported the Arabs that bombing was despicable. Instead you started this whole &quot;well they don't own the land and it will stop as soon as they leave&quot;<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> My house belongs to me. I didn't throw the previous family out and take it, renovate it, add a sunroom to it, drop a swimming pool in the backyard, then claim it to be mine just because I did those things.

My dollars are on your prejudice toward me, and all middle eastern people.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Actually it makes you ignorant I think because you completely missed the point that no matter who the house belongs to, once you use it as a weapon you forfeit your right to it. I dont care if your great great greart great granny esmerelda bought it 300 years ago and you have the title deeds to prove it. I'm not angry Miblis, a little frustrated by how brainwashed you are is about all.<br>

<br>
The only channels you actually receive anywhere outside the UK that is UK made is the BBC and the BBC world service. The americans own a fair bit but you'll find Europe has its own news stations. So too does China and Japan, Australia and more. That covers most of the occupied continents. North Africa is slowly building its television and radio network and anywhere below that on the map is either too preoccupied by whats happening in it's own backyard or has not progressed to that level yet.<br>
<br>
Considering we really have so little control over whats going on in the news other then on our own little island why is it that other societies other then British, Israeli and American think the Palestinians are the agressors here? Now whilst I don't say that being part of a majority makes you right, being part of such a small minority should really make you think about coming down off the cloud you're on.<br>

Yada yada yada. Mind if I nod off? You've said that 57 times in the last two threads. Over and over again you claim the land belongs to Palestine but you still don't have anything other then this as a basis for an argument. So it belonged to them 52 years ago. It belonged to Jews before. It belonged to someone else before that and now it belongs to Israel again. But that doesn't give any of them a right to it.<br>
<br>
Miblis, you come across as a robot, an agressive and possibly fanatical Arab who honestly believes that Arabs own the land and are justified in killing for it. At the end of the day I don't care who owns the land but you wont get to govern it while their is violence to the goverment that controls it. Either way your a stuck record so I'm not going to respond to you after this. If you don't mind I'll chat with Ujulain.<br>

I agree totally. But it's not going to happen whilst Palestinians are murdering people. I would hope that the area comes under a new rule, with both Israelis and Palestines jointly but I know it's not going to happen soon. I hope that British cartography can help in a fair way but nobodys going to shift any lines on a map at the moment.<br>

I'd also like for Northern Ireland to sort itself out and to fall under a new Northern Irish rule. For gods sake the English aren't doing a good job of it but be buggered if we're going to give it to the republic just because the IRA is blowing up the local McDonalds in Warrington.<br>
<br>
In both cases, stop the killing and we'll sit down and talk. I got lucky. When the bomb went off in Manchester the only thing damaged was the paintwork on my car that was showered in half a ton of glass, but to those that lost friends, family, people I knew it sickens me. Anyway, I digress.....<br>
<br>
I think you're wrong when you say if you mention Israels and the Jews your racist. Maybe it's true I don't know but if that's your experience then who am I to refute it. I would like to think that we can sit at our keyboards and talk about it.<br>
<br>
You're also right when you say that we don't want to forget what happened to the Jewish. But I don't think the holocaust should ever be forgotten. I may be ignorant of some of the other wars your talking about ergarding the turkish and all and feel free if you wish to expand my education but people over here have relatives killed by the germans, jewish friends, and such and for that it rings closer to home.<br>
<br>
This generation wont be the last to harp on about WWII but in time the stain that is still afforded to the Germans by the older generation will passwith them. I hold no enmity towards Germans. As this happens people will chalk up the holocaust and the destruction of the Jews to another generation to a lesson learnt. I dont think we don't want to forget just to invoke that guilt you talk of. Perhaps others do I don't know.<br>
<br>
You mention that Japan still teaches it's children that America was the agressor in WWII. I have to say I don't understand this. What you say astounds me because I realise the extent you'd have to go to to this to make it work. Which is not to say I disbelieve you. I am just astounded by that.<br>
<br>
You have to remove all the history books and all the films, you have to stop people getting access at American newspapers from that time, British newspapers. You have to silence anyone who speaks anything other then the truth, cut relevant access to the net, the list goes on.<br>
<br>
I understand that there are some American's who think that the war lasted for 2 years and America was involved from the start. Some Americans think that they won the war for us. I spoke to an American girl when I was grouped in Mistmoore one day who told me the British were stupid for not napalming france and germany,  instead sending soliders to die on french shores. But thats ignorance and not brainwashing as you mention in Japan or as I see in Miblis. Its a different thing.<br>
<br>
There are holes in my learning and I need to fill them. But one thing I'm sure of. The Arabs are not doing a lot to help themself and I can't argue with the way the Israeli government have reacted.<br>
<br>
Fill me in on something will you. The particular piece of land we're talking about. We know it as Israel. What do Arabs call it and what has it been known as historically? <p><HTML><CENTER>

<br>
Along with being a racist, which you have not disproven in any part of your last post.....you are now a pathological liar. Basically, you are lying about something that has obviously been proven not true earlier in these discussions.<br>
<br>
Oh what?  You don't understand what I'm talking about?  Do you remember how I said...."nothing justifies killing"?<br>
<br>
Do you remember that at all?  Put the crackpipe down, take a few deep breaths, and think about it.  Do you remember at what points I stated that nothing justifies killing?  Oh you don't remember?<br>
<br>
You don't belong in this thread, and you have overstayed your welcome.  Go ahead and begin agreeing with things I have been saying all along while you go talk to Ulujain.<br>
<br>
*sob*....he's going to ignore me....*cry*.....WAHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!<br>

Correct me if I'm wrong, but didn't the Republic of Ireland renounce its irredentist claims on Northern Ireland some time ago?<br>

Well, in a previous thread, the first thing out of Caoilfhionn's keyboard in response to exactly what I'm writing here were terms like I mentioned; anti-Semitic, etc...see? Even here, in this insignificant corner of the Web, you cannot have a debate with the subject of Israel in it without the usual name-throwing. The State of Israel needs to lose its &quot;protected species&quot; status with a few people before these issues can be dealt with sanely and without name-calling. I stated then, and I will state now, I have nothing against the Jewish faith, or the Hebrew people. I am firmly against the concept of the State of Israel. It, like the former &quot;Bantustans&quot; of South Africa, are a creation to appease one class out of many; hence its innate unfairness to those there already. <br>
<br>
The Palestinians have nowhere else to go. The area has been their home since the time of Christ and beyond. To suddenly be told, sorry, but your Semitic cousins the Hebrews, and those who follow their faith, Judaism, are now your Government and your rulers would come as an awful surprise to anyone.<br>
<br>
The idea that Arabs are a homogenous people too is far from the truth. The Turks overran them on the divide and conquer principle. They were (and remain to some extent) tribes. The Palestinians can't just get up and move to Saudi Arabia or Egypt because their &quot;Arab brothers&quot; are there. Not going to happen.<br>
<br>
The area where the State of Israel has been called Palestine for a long, long time. The name &quot;Palestine&quot; has no Arab background. It is a Latin derivation of a Greek work for the Phoenicians. Phillistia.<br>
<br>
The Romans called it Judaea. I'm not sure what the Turks referred to it as when it was a mere vilayet. Maybe just Palestine.<br>
<br>
As such it is, technically, a neutral name. Or it should be.<br>

Direct from Japanese school textbooks on WW2 history. The Australian Government made a huge issue of this some time back and asked Japan to 'fess up on certain realities. According to Japan, they were forced to bomb Pearl Harbor as America was impinging on their territorial gains and sovereignty in such places. There's a lot more to it than this, but, unless Japan has done a volte-face, it's what their schoolchildren are taught.<br>
