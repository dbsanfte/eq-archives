How would you like that to read when you replace rogue with ranger and pick pocketting with dying?<br>
<br>
&quot;If you don't like it, die yourself, or just don't group with them.&quot;<br>
<br>
My &quot;looting before they're dead&quot; is my business only. My usual groups consist people, who probably wouldn't like me practicing my entire set of skills, yet most groups I've been with welcome me back anytime with open arms. You draw your conclusions about it.<br>
<br>
It doesn't matter if someone decides not to have me in group because of these kind of things around, but it bothers me when some pre50 rogue gets hard time getting groups,  because of comments like this. <p>---<BR>

First off, when I play my rogue, I like to roleplay, same as my ranger. When im playing MESTTAH, my rogue, there's his name for yah, I play  him like  he should be. A thieving, sly bastage. When I'm on my ranger I'm an animal loving nature freak. I am not some rude thieving prick in real life, as you called me. I don't rip people off. I play my character and enjoy it. On a side note, I never posted how much I pick pocket, when I pick pocket, or how many times I have ever done it. So in a nutshell you have just condoned all rogues who ever pickpocketed at least once. My rogue is pretty stacked, and I prefer to solo most of the time anyways. Although a nice group with fun people is always welcome. My post was answering the first post to start this thread,  do you pick pocket or not. Apparently it got off topic and now I'm being flamed just for saying I do, and encouraging it. Are you really so poor that you have to absolutely hate someone because they took a few coins off a mob. Does it matter to you soo much that you just can't bear to let it go?<br>
<br>
Anyways...Kalaks, I can understand your concern, Maybe you feel that I'm giving rogues a bad rep by saying something like that. Everybody determines their own reputation, if you are a great person then you have nothing to worry about bro.<br>
Oh btw, member when you offered me 14k for mesttah's bloodpoint? Well I shoulda taken it..I ended up getting alot less.<br>
<br>
P.S. Rogues can die just as fast as rangers. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
Just reminded me when I levelled my ass up among pickup groups and the times... as totally untwinked rogue soloing became bad option at level 10 or so. Add to that people who didn't know about other classes figured rogues are just weak warriors and thats all.<br>
<br>
And this all was AFTER the rogues were fixed. I don't know about others, but I almost never ended up seeing pickup group's peoples again, thus even when I made a positive impression, I had to prove it again in next group. This wasn't as bad as it sounds, as many groups knew what rogues do.<br>
<br>
So therefore I'm a bit overpicky perhaps for what sounds giving more reason not to group with rogues. I didn't mean it to sound like that, it was just the lower level main char rogues that I was concerned about. It just was so much more LFG 49- compared to 50+.<br>
<br>
So in a nutshell didn't mean to pick it that hard. And you shouldn't have sold yer Blood Point for less than 14k =). <p>---<BR>

<quote>I pickpocket with my rogue, I don't see anything wrong with it. After all, rogue is a nice word for thief, which is what they are.</quote><br>
First off a rogue in EQ is not a thief.  He is a damage dealer who can be sneaky when necessary.  Second Rogue means:<br>
<br>
<bold>rogue (rg)<br>
n. <br>
An unprincipled, deceitful, and unreliable person; a scoundrel or rascal. <br>
One who is playfully mischievous; a scamp. <br>
A wandering beggar; a vagrant. <br>
A vicious and solitary animal, especially an elephant that has separated itself from its herd. <br>
An organism, especially a plant, that shows an undesirable variation from a standard </bold><br>
<br>
You will notice that while rogue can mean deceitful, it does not mean thief.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<quote>They are shady, they are clever, they are swift. Stealing is what "rogues" do best, and I'll be damned if I don't put it to good use.</quote><br>
Hmmmm see point number 1.  Damage is what rogues do best.  Second best would be corpse retrieval, and third is scoutting out areas, maybe sneak pulling.  Stealing is maybe 5th maybe.  Of course maybe what you mean here is YOUR rogue is best at stealing from his group.  Oh wait you can solo your rogue(possibly the worst class in EQ for soloing) so that must not be it.<br>
<br>
 <quote>I think its sad how people complain about "rogues" pick pocketing. Alot of it is out of jealousy, the rest is conscience. If you don't like it, play a rogue, or just don't group with them. For all you rogues out there I encourage pick pocketing. Not only for roleplaying purposes, but to play the rogue class as it was truly meant to be. Every class has it's special skills, spells, or abilities that help then earn a little cash. This is your's, use it.<br>
<br>
P.S. What they don't know can't hurt em.</quote><br>
This is just so much bullshit.  It has to do with a member of a group taking something from the group without sharing.  Kinda like ninja looting before the loot messages were added.  Or was that just jealousy too??<br>
<br>
And actually what they don't know can and does hurt the rogue class.  See when people like you come along and talk about how pickpockets is the defining ability of a rogue and how all rogues should do it whenever they want, it gives all the people who may not know about rogues a bad taste about them.  Then you see it is those of us who play rogues as main characters who are hurt.  Sure if you can't find somewhere to solo your rogue you can always go back and play your mana sink.  But I and many others like me have worked at getting up to a decent level and when I have to put up with not getting invited to a group because they are afraid I will steal all the loot it is very frustrating.<br>
<br>
So Thaddius/Mesttah if I seem to be acting a bit harsh about this it is with good reason.  If you didn't mean what you said in your first post, maybe you should choose your words more carefully next time.<br>

Rogues can't tp, they can't gate, and they don't have any stat altering buffs.  So again, how do you get out of zone?<br>
<br>
Think about it people. A rogue is a great addition to a group.  The extra damage output a rogue provides far outweighs his/her occassional use of pick pocket skill.  The paranoia about a rogue stealing from a group is really unfounded and IMO simply uncalled for.<br>

(If you ask a rogue to masterloot, you are trusting the rogue more then other classes, since he/she can pick gems spells etc and you wont see them)<br>
<br>
Free for all loot, ask group before hand, if you can pick some mobs.  If group says yes, be fair about it.  Pick what you would normally get looting.<br>
<br>
Group as a whole are assholes to you?  Up to you, but as a rogue you can fuck over the loot table pretty bad in places like OS.<br>
<br>
Pre 50 pickpocket is pretty harmless.  Post 50 you can really hurt groups (or raids...poh etc) when you pick.  In OS as long as the mobs take to die, you would have 6 or 7 chances to pick the mob.  Gems, spells have a tendancy to pick out first, then coin starting from plat down to copper.  <br>
<br>
There is a potential for abuse there. I think this is where it comes down to your reputation.  If you group with a rogue and notice cash loot is a little low for plat and gem loot is almost non-existant...maybe you should pay attention.  Group with the rogue on a regular basis and notice loot is FUBAR everytime you group then it may be prudent to talk about it.<br>
<br>
The only problem is that loot is variable, and it is almost impossible to prove a rogue is picking, unless every loot is 1 plat 1 gold 1 silver 1 copper.<br>
<br>
Solution: For Verent to give all mobs a chance to emote or shout the little thief thing.  Right now its only human mob types.<br>
<br>
Also remember that we cant pick &quot;animals&quot; or &quot;undead&quot;...at least as far as I know.<br>
<br>
LIttle off-topic rant:<br>
Oh yeah, when a rogue, or any class for that matter, is doing a cr we usually dont ask for a donation, but remember without that cr its gonna take alot longer to get that res, and we are risking our xp to get your corpses.  Little more risk then that cleric that is sitting in the zone saying no res for joo unless joo got 100 plat.....<br>
<br>
Remember to THANK people who drag your corpses, that is all most of us ask<br>

It goes without saying that I did not seem very, ah.. professional, at that moment.

<br>
There are times when picking a mob is innappropriate.  Like when there is a designated master looter who splits coin with the group. <br>
For the most part though, I pickpocket mobs when there is a loot-whore in the group or it's free for all and I pick but don't loot.  <br>
Any time I pick gems or spells I always put them up for random or in guild raid scenarios, give them to the designated spell/gem mule. <br>
There is no reason someone should be upset at a pp'ing rogue who splits with the group and randoms the gems/spells.  Any show of anger towards an upfront pp'er is just jealousy. <br>
The real valueable items can't be picked anyway. (lore, no drop) items. <br>
If you suspect the rogue in your group is pp'ing and not splitting then just make sure they arent looting dead mobs also.  Pretty fair to do one and not the other. <br>
