It amazes me how much time you waste digging for useless information Chuk, haven't you got better things to do with your time, well as the record stands obviously not.<br>
<br>
You really need to check your sources of information Chuk, I think they only tell you this information to set you up and make you look foolish again...and again....and again.....shall I go on?<br>
<br>
How many times do you have to be made to look foolish on this board Chuk, before you realise you are a retard?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> The Facts About The Website And Message Board</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
My guilds web site and message board was hosted on a server that I paid the $$$ for by myself, uno, all me. Get the picture my server space?!?!?<br>
<br>
I left the guild over 2 months ago, and I left the Message boards and Guild Site up, yes once again on my server space that I paid for and free of charge to them. I am limited to 1gb transfer a month and the site was hosted on a sub-domain of www.dwarkarn.com. As dwarkarn.com became more and more popular, the guilds website combined with the bandwidth for my main site was pushing my resources close to the limit, not wanting to pay for extra bandwidth I shut the guild site down. After two months of leaving the guild I feel this is totally fair and reasonable, why sould I pay for hosting a guild web site I am no longer part of?<br>
<br>
So no retard you are barking up the wrong tree again, the website was shut down nearly two months ago and the action was not out of anger. My decision to quit EQ wasn't out of anger either, why the fvck would I quit EQ out of anger???! I am bored with something I move on, to me Chuck it seems like EQ is the only thing you have in your life, someone quits because they think it's boring now and you get your panties in a not.<br>
<br>
Please do some more digging and try to find some more dirt on me, I enjoy making you look like a clusterfvck. <p><center><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=6929">Rolelen Dwarkarn - 60 Warlord - Kind of retired, well maybe not I log on from time to time when masturbation gets boring</a><br>

<br>
Anyway, along with you and the others who are posting their goodbyes on the day or within 24 hours of the level limits raise, there must have been some idea that made you go, &quot;ugh 5 more levels, guess its time to quit.&quot;<br>
<br>
This part is whats hard to understand. Did those 5 levels provide the broken camels back on a decision?<br>
Yes the game got &quot;boring&quot; and whatever excuse you can come up with, but why did it become overly boring just 3 days ago which brought many to the decision that it was time to move on?<br>
<br>
Its easy to say &quot;but but but i quit 3 months ago poop farts poop&quot; but the &quot;goodbye&quot; post on the general forum is just a few days ago. Soooooooo, there must have been a motivation for that goodbye or otherwise youd have stayed in non active limbo indefinitely. This is is a question for everyone.<br>
<br>
Once again im not upset or bitter, this topic, because the reactions over 5 more levels is highly entertaining. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/udwarkarn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dwarkarn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 4569<br> <font color=#E9D756>(9/17/02 6:47:41 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3627.topic&index=65>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Did ya really quit?</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> So you gave notice you were shutting it down?

<br>
I never claimed to be a saint I am far from one, but why should I give notice for shutting it down? I had left the guild for two months, it was on my server space, I could of shut it down straight away upon leaving the guild, but out of the good of my &quot;saintly heart&quot; I decided to keep it up and running for a little while. No one from the guild contacted me in regards to continue to use the server space that I paid for to host their site, why should it be up to me to contact them? Please list the reasons of why I am such an arse for not contacting them Chuk, in point form if it makes it easier for you. <br>
<br>
Not that any of this business concerns you, but you have brought it here to a public board and I am so happy you have because it just gives me another reason to make you look foolish in public. I bet you are cursing your sources right now aren't you Chuck? Have they got any other little tidbits of information you would care to make public here? Or are you over the fact that I can make you look stupid on a message board anytime that I desire?<br>
<br>
Seriously Chuk don't start @#%$ unless you know the facts behind it, I am sure the crowd wants to see the big &quot;heavyweight&quot; title fight between Chukzombie and Dwarkarn, but what good is it if you go and get knocked on your arse in the first round? I bet you had a little miniscule erection when you found out about that website that i pulled down, it's a pity that erection shrunk back into your stomach when I killed every point you had. Seriously Chuk next time you dig some &quot;dirt&quot; on me, just email me and I will be happy to tell you whether its worthy of posting or not, it might save you the embarrassmentthat you continualy cause yourself on these boards.<br>

Anyone else able to answer the question on why quit now if you truly quit instead of earlier or later? it just seems too much like a hokey coincedence on the day or within 24 hours of the level limit raise to quit on an entirely different reason.<br>
<br>
If you quit becuase you didnt want to do those terrible 5  more levels thats fine, it may be a bit @#%$ on your part but at least its being honest. <br>

Where I come from the curteous person would be the one that contacts the ex-guild member paying for the webspace for 2 months, asking what arrangements could be made to continue hosting the site, things must be different in cesspool retardia, must be a nice place to live in eh Chuk?<br>

Oh I feel so low, so so low. It seems to mean so much more to you it did to my EX-guild at the time. When I pulled the site I kept a back-up of all information, no one ever contacted me about why I pulled the site, or paying me for the bandwidth they were leeching so why would I worry about what anyone thought? Surely If I upset anyone they would of emailed me. The first contact I had with a Mystic Coercion member after I pulled the site, I informed them that I had backups to send them if they wanted to ressurect the site, and even offered them help to do it on their own server space, but they declined, I can't do much more than that.<br>

No, I didn't laugh HAHAHAH! But maybe they were because they had a website set up on a server I payed for. Two months after I left the guild and they still had a site set up on sh|t I was paying for, like I said before two months is enough, why expect an ex guild member (one that /guildremoved himself may I add) to keep paying for server space for the guilds site. Let's say you left a guild Chuk, would you consider to host their website on your server space after 2 months without any contact if it was costing you money? If you say yes you are more of a fvcking retard than I thought you were.<br>
<br>
How many times have I got to make you look like a fvcking moron Chuky boi? You don't have one scrap of evidence against me, you keep going back to this stupid website/messageboard bullshit, and everytime you come with it my rebuttal slams you in the face with more impact than Eastern Airlines Flight 401 hit the Florida Everglades.<br>
<br>
Learn a lesson Chuk or get some more facts, I am sure you can log on to EQ and check your wonderful &quot;information network&quot; for more information, but be careful they are the ones responsible for getting you into this mess in the first place.<br>

The members who approached me were without a board thanks to you. I guess they were upset wrongly when they mentioned there was no notice.<br>
<br>
That &quot;huge&quot; bandwidth you let them &quot;leech&quot; off of you for free must give you carte blanche in nuking their board info. Once again your halo is showing.  <br>
<br>
If you think you are owning me, why the earnest responses? you are so concerned about your trollboard spaminator rep that you go to any lengths, including lying to make you look less than the assburglar you are coming off as right now.<br>
<br>
For the record i dont care about this incident and this is the last i will mention it , but it shows that those who live in glass houses sure do throw a lot of stones. <br>
I never had a problem with you dwark but when you attack people for having valid issues then you end up on the craplist.<br>

Give everyone on this board a fvcking break Chuk, we can only live with your delusion for so long, in your delusional world have you elevated yourself to God status?

Once again I never claimed to have a halo, once again your lack of ability to read past posts shows through.

So let me get this right d|ckhead, since Ogmuk run this board and no longer he plays EQ he is pathetic as well?? Vendrix and all the others must be pathetic as well right, since they don't play EQ any longer and continue to post??.<br>

In the grand scheme of things, the difference between someone who spends 8 hours a day trolling message boards about EQ, and someone who spends 8 hours a day playing EQ, is so infintesimal that it's laughable.  The fact that people would even begin to argue about it is kind of tragic.<br>
