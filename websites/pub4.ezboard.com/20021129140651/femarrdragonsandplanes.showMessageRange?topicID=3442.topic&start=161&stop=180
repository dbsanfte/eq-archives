For those that don't believe in God, it's untrue.  For those who do believe in God, it's redundant.  May as well leave it out as far as I'm concerned, but I wouldn't be so bold as to say it's unconstitutional.<br>

<br>
Byrd might have just been trying to stir up controversey, but it's still hateful. Imagine the commotion we'd have if he had told Jews or Italians to leave the country instead.<br>
<br>
As far as I know, this was not reported on any news source, I got the quote from the Congressional Record for June 26th.  I find that pretty fvcking scary.<br>
<br>
Okay, I think I'm going to leave this thread, but I want to say one last thing.<br>
<br>
I started this thread with only a vague feeling of why I felt the way I did, of why I felt it was important for church and state to be scrupulously kept separate and that the government should show NO preference for one religion at the expense of others.  In my mind, it was just a basic question of fairness, of not wanting anyone to feel excluded or left out based on what god/gods/or lack of gods they worshipped.<br>
<br>
Unlike a lot of the posters on this thread, I decided to do some research.  I had a pretty good background in our Constitution and the formation of our country due to my choice of degree in college, but I really appreciated this chance to learn more<br>
<br>
Unlike a lot of the posters on this thread, I know that the framers of our Constitution were not Christians.  &quot;The Founders and their generation came fresh from witnessing, first-hand, the destruction that is tyrannical government exploiting religion for its own ends and greedy, clannish religion invoking the power of government to enforce its policies of favoritism with the edge of the sword. It's easy to see that the Founders saw the separation of religion from government as essential to human Liberty.&quot;<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> U.S. Constitution, Article VI, paragraph 3:<br>
The Senators and Representatives before mentioned, and the Members of the several State Legislatures, and all executive and judicial Officers, both of the United States and of the several States, shall be bound by Oath or Affirmation, to support this Constitution; <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> but no religious Test shall ever be required as a Qualification to any Office or public Trust under the United States.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Unlike a lot of the posters on this thread, I am aware of the history of the Pledge of Allegiance and under what circumstances the words &quot;under God&quot; were inserted.  Words added specifically to divide, to reveal hidden communists.<br>
<br>
Unlike a lot of the posters on this thread, I have researched Supreme Court rulings on Church and State for the past 100 years and understand (although not always 100% agree with every decision) why they made certain rulings.  I understand the Establishment Clause and what it means.<br>
<br>
I learned that students are allowed to pray in school, that it is their right to free speech to do so, and I agree with this.  It is organized, school led/facilitated prayer that I don't agree with.<br>
<br>
The rest of you can keep arguing about how you &quot;feel&quot; without one scrap of history or law to back you up and keep saying how those that don't agree with saying &quot;under God&quot; in the Pledge of Allegiance can just get the hell out or keep arguing the semantics of what &quot;God&quot; means.<br>
<br>
I learned a lot, how about you?<br>

The founders that 'I' like were diests. However,<br>
there will always be the foolish non-thinking knee-jerk reaction.<br>
<br>
There is always some person that has to proclaim loudly that failure to believe<br>
or expouse point-of-view (whatever) is the same as treason.<br>
<br>
Does prayer in school 'pressure' children who dont wish to pray? Yes of course it does. Anyone who remembers gradeschool can recall that pressure.<br>
Yet I know people that feel that is why prayer SHOULD be allowed. To <br>
coherce children into accepting some point-of-view or at least pretending<br>
that they have accepted it.<br>
<br>
Does burning a flag harm anyone except the owner? Not unless it is done in an unsafe manner. And yet people SCREAM when they see it. Why?, Could simply be an old flag. <br>
<br>
Its like that stupid confederate flag issue in South Carolina. Why do people care?<br>
Let them raise any flag the constituents want. Its a non-issue. If SC wants a confederate flag - Hey I say thats great man. More power to yah. I might also think<br>
a few other things that I wont say.<br>
<br>
I have a far better issue to get enraged about.<br>
This weekend on CNN watching Robert Novak try and defend Enron and Worldcom<br>
and ArthurAnderson.<br>
<br>
He said 'If you want capitalism you will have to accept capitalism's excesses'<br>
<br>
This is the same guy who agreed with Pat Buchanan on Crossfire when Pat said<br>
that the USA should NOT allow universal franchise. That there should be a minimum property requirement to vote.<br>
<br>
Nice guys all of these. Real nice. Their bosses are playing with YOUR money.<br>
Something to think about.<br>

Take the battle of Fort Sumter as described in our national anthem.  The line &quot;that our flag was still there&quot; meant that the Americans had held off the British from taking that particular spot, so seeing our flag still flying over the fort meant a lot to those involved.  And our flag still means more than just a few pieces of cloth sewn together.  It represents the original 13 colonies (the beginning) up to our current configuration (the present), and all those that died along the way defending our soil and our way of life.  But, after reading your many bloated, paranoid rants, Chit, I see that there is nothing in this world that is important to you.

Here's some quickies:<br>
<br>
Glori:  I don't believe having an answer book makes anything any easier.  And there are plenty of atheist religious texts around that will provide you with whatever moral code you choose.  [And &quot;atheist religious&quot; wasn't an error.]<br>
<br>
Merentha:  My statement wasn't directed at you.  I've just gotten that one a lot over the many years I've been involved in religious debates.  It's terribly humorous to hear someone tell me I'm wrong, and then tell me I'm close-minded.  And it's even funnier when they refuse to recognize how they are more so than me.  I at least listened and weighed their ideas before deciding they were in error.<br>
<br>
Iwka:  My life is anything but boring.  To suggest otherwise merely because I'm a believer (similar to Glori's claim that it's easier for the same reason) is pretty shallow.  And to critique all of Christendom because one professed believer is a lunatic, is neither fair nor rational.  &quot;Guilt by association&quot; isn't usually acceptable.<br>
<br>
Chit:  Just because the Supremes say you can't be prosecuted for something, doesn't mean that it is right to do it.  I'm not a fanatical patriot in any respect, but flag burning is wrong.  It may be legal, but it's still wrong.  You've espoused similar feelings as I recall on a few subjects (abortion being one, although I may be wrong).  Why not recognize this one?<br>
<br>
Why do people care about the Confederate Flag, for the exact reason we care about the American Flag:  &quot;for which it stands.&quot;  The Confederate Flag stands for slavery in the eyes of most Americans (those that say it stands for states rights are either fooling themselves or trying to fool others).  To govern under a flag devoted to slavery taints the action of all those in the state.  The boycott against SC is a very good way of hitting politicians where it hurts, the budget and the warchest. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/umerentha.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Merentha</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 127<br> <font color=#E9D756>(7/1/02 10:52:35 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3442.topic&index=169>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Glori</span><hr size=1> &lt;&lt;He said 'If you want capitalism you will have to accept capitalism's excesses'&gt;&gt;<br>

while I have a lot of probs with your post, I will limit myself to this one. This statement is absolutely true. It is similar to saying that if you want free speech, you have to accept a Robert Maplethorpe and a Larry Flynt.<br>

<br>
I am a historian by both inclination and training. I see more than a slavery issue<br>
in the Civil War. I see a federal government throwing its weight around.<br>
Slavery was just ONE issue. Not disputing it was a valid issue, it WAS.<br>
<br>
If the 'people' of SC want to have an anachronism floating above the state house,<br>
I say, let em. However I do not dispute the right of the rest of the country to be appalled. There is nothing illegal or immoral about not doing business with people<br>
you dont like. That is free choice. I think SC did that to flip the entire country off,<br>
and to get attention. And of course it worked. <br>
If you go to the Kentuky Derby, you might want to leave such sentiments behind.<br>
There are quite a few flags flying there. Yet I hear no one screaming about it.<br>
Like I said its a non-issue.<br>
<br>
As for flag burning: I myself have never burned a flag. I would do it of course if<br>
it were soiled, or dishonored. That hasnt happened. However there are people<br>
who see no more than colored cloth when they see a flag. Those people cannot<br>
empathize with 'true believers' <br>
However they are legitimate citizens of the United States. I dont recomend<br>
tossing them out. However I see nothing wrong with backing an amendment<br>
to the Constitution to make it illegal. That too is free choice.<br>
<br>
I do have a problem with certain 'in your face' militancy that loudly proclaims that<br>
if you dont agree your WRONG and that you being wrong isnt tolerable.<br>
That type of thing borders on facism. That IS dangerous.<br>
<br>
John Calvin promoted similar attitudes. The list is endless. <p>“It is clear that the individual who persecutes a man, his brother, because he is not of the same opinion, is a monster.”

Do you recall a man called 'Ivan Bolesky'? I doubt it.<br>
That man ruined thousands of lives. Yet today he walks free.(or has died of old age<br>
maybe who knows - but he ISNT in jail)<br>
<br>
If you shoot a man in cold blood in front of witnesses you can expect at least <br>
20 years hard time(I am sure Raedwulf will correct me if I am wrong)<br>
<br>
If you swindle thousands of investors out of their life savings and get caught,<br>
you can expect AT MOST 5 years in a minimum security prison, with all the ammenities of home. That ISNT equity. That ISNT fair.<br>
<br>
If I were one of those investors, that had been impoverished by such a man,<br>
I just might be thinking along different lines now. Yet such men, in our society<br>
far from being disgraced, are admired for beating the system.<br>
<br>
Look at ENRON and WorldCom and ArthurAnderson. Do you really think any of them<br>
(the people who actually created the disaster) will suffer?<br>
You are naive if you do. They took care of that angle long ago. They have assests<br>
squirrled away where they cannot be touched. And so shall it remain.<br>
Look at Microsoft blackmailing the entire country and getting away with it.<br>
Because no one is willing to cross them.<br>
These are the excesses of capitalism. Judge Lynch never sleeps. 1792 wasnt<br>
that long ago. <p>“It is clear that the individual who persecutes a man, his brother, because he is not of the same opinion, is a monster.”

If you mean that in the present, the issue most often, by most people, associated with the confederate flag is slavery, I would agree. <br>
If however, you are saying that states rights wasnt a primary, in my opinion THE primary issue of the states leaving to form the confederacy represented by that flag, I disagree with you. It is very difficult for us today to understand the past importance of states' rights today when those rights are pretty much eroded. <p>I think, therefore I am . . .

<br>
And I don't critique all of Christendom on one act.  But having almost died due to religious 'conflicts' and terrorism (and I really don't want to get into this), and having felt the direct loss stemming from these ahem conflicts (you know, the people, not statistics, that die), I personally cannot find any of the Christian subsets resonating with me.  Again, I was stating my personal opinion on the matter, not trying to 'suede others to my way of thinking on religion.  It was an offtopic post.<br>
<br>
I do however wish I didn't feel so lonely in my love of the Constitution, and what it represents, and the first 10 amendments.  Flag burning has been brought up, which is something I wouldn't do, I love what it represents to me a bit too much; but it is freedom of speech, it doesn't fall into the yelling fire in the middle of a crowded building situation, but hey the Court already ruled on that one anyhow.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/umerentha.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Merentha</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 133<br> <font color=#E9D756>(7/1/02 1:03:50 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3442.topic&index=180>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Merentha</span><hr size=1> &lt;&lt;Do you recall a man called 'Ivan Bolesky'?

I have met Mr Boesky two times. I recall each of those times vividly, more for the occasions and surroundings than for meeting Mr. Boesky. <br>
<br>
Since some might consider communism a direct alternative to capitalism, would you like to compare the excesses represented by Boesky to those represented by Joe Stalin?<br>
<br>
I do not believe that Mr Novak was trying to say we shouldnt do anything to combat the excesses of capitalism, but that we must accept that excesses will occur and not forsake  capitalism because of those excesses.  I know I should not speak for Mr Novak, but that is how I interpreted his words and suggest that reading of them for your consideration<br>
