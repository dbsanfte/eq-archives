Well, I myself don't feel hurt whatsoever at this point, at any responses I am receiving here.<br>
<br>
We have a lot of different groups here.  We have those who think I don't have any right to express my feelings.  We have those who say I am an asshole, interesting.  We have a very small minority who actually see where I am coming from.<br>
<br>
Perhaps I didn't make myself clear, that is the only way I could see such a large majoirty of people untactfully attacking me with absolutely no thought.<br>
<br>
Let me explain "<b>The Bottom Line</b>(TM)" with an analogy I think everyone can relate to.<br>
<br>
Our beloved country of America has more or less, issued somewhat of a statement.<br>
<br>
That statement is that all countries who do not wish to back the United States against the enemy, do not condemn terrorism.....and are the enemy.<br>
<br>
In more or less words, that is what the Bush Administration has stated.  I think it is a good statement, and a fair statement.  It is my assumption that Bush is meaning the governments of those countries, not the actual...countries.  Anyhow....<br>
<br>
If you disagree with my stance against people who welcome genocide/racism in this world, that means you also welcome genocide/racism.<br>
<br>
You might not like the graphic nature I presented it, but a group of you seem to like the graphic nature that Justicia, and others put their feelings.  Just in less words.<br>
<br>
You agree with me, then you wish for revenge against those who committed this act, and not their people and children.<br>
<br>
You disagree, then you will probably join the 7 people I mentioned originally in burning hell.  You want genocide?  I believe that God will make you pay for that belief.<br>
<br>
On that note, let me explain to you something that happened to several of my friends mothers the last few days.<br>
<br>
On one instance, my Libyan friend's mother was in our local mall.  She was buying shoes, and some fellows surrounded her and began throwing out some interesting slurs.<br>
<br>
"Sand-nigger"<br>
"Desert-fag"<br>
"Arabic shit"<br>
<br>
Apparently these people were in line to buy something, then saw her from a-far and ran up on her.  So it wasn't like she was right there in front of them, and their anger and rage took over.  They went out of their way, to bother her.<br>
<br>
A similar thing happened to a covered Islamic woman at a grocery store here.  In addition to the things which happened to the other lady, the guys who surrounded her here followed her to her car, and she left crying.<br>
<br>
Now I know most Americans aren't like these people.  I know I am not.  (oh yeah, if you forgot, I am American...born here, remember?)<br>
<br>
However, that select group of people, who are growing everyday....they aren't real patriotic Americans.  Nope, they aren't.  They can be angry, they can rage...thats fine.  However its hypocritical as a COUNTRY, to be racist to anyone.  This country, is a little over 200 years old, and is made up of all other countries, as far as ethnicity goes.  So for these people to do that, make them....well I have said it before...filth.  A walking contradiction.<br>
<br>
I feel terribly sorry for them.  When I heard about those things that occurred in the city I live in, it nearly threw me in a rage, because these racists aren't standing up for anyone in particular.  These people don't know what Americans are.<br>
<br>
I love America.  I love patriotic Americans.  However, if you say you're American, and you state that an entire race should die, or you harass people of another race....you're not a patriotic American.  As a matter of fact, you're less then human.  You're a dog, and you deserved to be chained to a fence, watching real Americans live their life <b>free</b>.<br>
<br>
Don't claim you're American, and pull the bullshit I see on this thread, and what I hear is happening on the streets.  You're a disgrace to America, and you should have all human rights taken away from you.  You're a rabid dog.  You have the intelligence of a dog.  You lack any sense whatsoever to carry the state of an American.<br>
<br>
I'm not God, and I never claimed to be.  That would be not only ridiculous, but offensive for anyone to claim they are God.<br>
<br>
However, if I got to choose who went to hell, and who didn't, frankly, I know who I would choose.  Racists.  All shithole racists.....American, Middle Eastern, Hispanic, Canadian, Israeli.....etc.<br>
<br>
Racists deserve to burn in bloody hell.  They already lack a soul on this earth, but hell will certainly take away anything else they thought they had.  I know that a lot of African-Americans can see my points, can you?<br>

You came out against peoples reactions to this event, when in reality you are upset at the racist treatment your people are recieiving which is totally understandable.  But you have to realize something, these people posting here are mostly angry and upset and can't express themselves properly, they aren't really racisit, yes maybe some of them are and do wish hate on any and all of your people, but thats not all of them, not all of these people wish genocide, pherhaps genocide of those responisble (which is vastly different).  All and all I think there was a misunderstanding of how people feel and are expressing their feelings.  I think we should all step back and think things over and spend time with our families.  Lets not haste to judge those we call our neighbors and countrymen.<br>
<br>
I don't have the answers to everything but I think we need to step back and take some time to get out our emotions, before we all come on here and start throwing insults and slang, and the like.  I for one am sorry for some things I said in haste, but thats what they are, words in haste.  <br>
<br>
Take some time and hug your family, and let your emotions out...God bless<br>

You're an asshole.  And please go down to your local mall and start telling people that they are un-patriotic.  Oh and before you do that get a friend to tape it for all of us that would love to watch.  BTW you are making a fundamental error in your latest argument, it's call a false dilemma.  You are making the same mistake Sen. McCarthy on his communist witch-hunts.  He claimed that if you didn’t agree with him that you must be a communist because someone who wasn’t a communist would agree with him.  Since you seem to be a total retard I’ll explain this to you.  Just because someone doesn’t agree with you doesn’t make them a racist or un-patriotic.  Anyone with half a brain would have figured out by now that people are angry and you just keep stirring the coals.  You are a sad and pathetic person, I feel sorry for anyone who knows you.  You do indeed seem to like making everyone upset.  Whatever god you worship, he or she or it is frowning on you now.<br>

To everyone else who is reading this, please do not post anymore this person is just enjoying the rise he is getting out of us.  He is not worth our thought or time.<br>
