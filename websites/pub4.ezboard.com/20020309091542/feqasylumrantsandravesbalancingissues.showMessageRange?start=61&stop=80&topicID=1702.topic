Nuclear Power... there's significant differences between the way that North American power plants are run, and the way European plants are run.  Management styles are different, work environments are different, attitude towards work vs. life is different.  Aside from the signficant technological difference as stated by Oxoxo, more often than not, disasters are caused by Humans.  The Europeans are in many ways MUCH more advanced at Human Factors than North Americans are.  They take it more seriously than we do and weigh the Human element in any complex system more heavily than we do.  All this contributes to a much lower risk of disaster to the point where it has become an acceptable risk in their societies.<br>
<br>
As for Turner.  I am not defending his position on anything.  What I am defending is the knee-jerk reaction that people have when someone makes an unpopular statement.  What he said has some merit, and it's shameful that the grief caused by the abhorent assault on the US has clouded the minds of otherwise objective thinkers on these topics.  My gut reaction is also to nuke to high hell the bastard fucks that perpetrated the attacks.  However, my head knows that there are understandable reasons for such a large population of the world hates the US so much.  Look deeper into what he's saying, not just about the &quot;courage&quot; depicted by the terrorists (I don't know enough about how much the terrorists actually knew before they started the campaign to form an opinion on the subject), but the root causes of hate.<br>
<br>
Kalnayr... and if the terrorists were your neighbours would you still feel that way?... collateral damage is acceptable as long as it's not you?<br>

I have no problem with people speaking their opinions.  Your opinions may differ from mine, but you have every right to hold them.  What I have a problem with is people resorting to violence, and excusing it away as a reaction to &quot;an oppressive government.&quot;  What good does it do for your cause when your actions cause injury or death to others?  I frankly don't care if you're out there protesting an unjust war, or econimic disparity, or a supposed loss of civil liberties, or whatever.  Knock yourself out.  Hell, I probably agree with at least some of what you're saying.  But the minute you stop talking and start throwing shoving people into offices at gunpoint because &quot;that's the only way our voices can be heard,&quot; or you set off pipe bombs because you disagree with some government policy, or you knock down buildings with airliners, you've crossed the line, and civilization demands that you be punished.

interesting that most posters here use the term terrorist and arab interchangeably.... lots of other terrorists out there....<br>
and people wonder why the IRA suddenly decided that peace may be a good idea after sept 11 when their sentimental friends in the US decided that terrorism really was a bad thing...<br>
(and please dear god do not try and defend noraid - some of us have had to live with mainland terrorism for over 30 years...)<br>
<br>
re nuclear fuel - europe may appear to have tighter control - but that is probably because it is mainly run by governements - not companies.....<br>
<br>
re oil - yes - the so called civilised west needs oil to survive.... but so do the countries selling the oil - they don't sell the oil - they go nowhere.....<br>
<br>
finally - the right of free speech - that is what is worth fighting for - even if some may use it to disagree with you.... <p><center>

I'll take a stab.  Probably get some things wrong, but that's okay.  <br>
<br>
A lot of people resent the wealth that the citizens of the US enjoy.  Even the majority of the poor here would be very well-off in most Third World countries.  We try to alleviate that resentment with foreign aid.  True, we're trying to help the people of other countries.  But we're also trying to buy friendships.  The people in those countries who aren't busy trying to survive another day no doubt hate us for having the balls to try to buy them off so that we can use them off.  And they also see us as a bunch of arrogant people who'll do whatever it takes to win.  That's part of the American spirit, and it has served us well in most cases.  But people don't like to be bullied.  I'm sure foreign governments dislike being cajoled by Washington.<br>
<br>
Many people hate us for the excess that our society promotes.  Ours may be a nation based upon freedom, but we don't always do things the right way.  We sit here and self-righteously decry the drug problem, even as we are the primary market for drugs.  We talk about morality, yet me allow a perjurer and adulterer to remain in office because a) the economy is good, b) some politicians are afraid that their party will lose the following election if he's removed, and c) we excuse his behavior by saying, &quot;well, everyone does it, so just leave him alone,&quot; despite the fact that most people <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> do not</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> cheat on their spouses, let alone lie about their behavior in court.  We talk of world peace, but we sell weapons to pretty much anyone who wants them (as long as they have good lobbyists to ensure the sale is approved by Washington).  We judge people not by their intrinsic value, but by what they can do for a company or a political cause.  So, while we see ourselves as a noble and good nation, others see us as a nation of arrogant hypocrites who want to impose our obvious inequities upon them. <br>
<br>
The US is the best country on the face of the earth.  But because of our power, people see us as a modern Rome, crushing all opposition with our militarty and our finances.  It's inaccurate (please read this thread: <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumrantsandravesbalancingissues.showMessage?topicID=1712.topic">pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylu...1712.topic</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--> regarding our financial state); but many people see us as terrible influences upon their culture.  Our movies, magazines and television programs are almost universal.  Yet I imagine people in other countries get tired of hearing, &quot;Well, in America we...&quot; and then complete the sentence.  Wouldn't you get tired of hearing someone tell you that the way you solve problems is wrong because they do it a different way somewhere else?  <br>
<br>
I'm not saying the US is a rotten country.  It's a hell of a lot better than anyplace I can think of.  We just tend to be inconsiderate of others and force our will upon them &quot;for their own good.&quot;  And that causes us to gain enemies.  <br>

Should professors just stop flunking me(or other people) because some people will hate them for doing so, and possibly want them dead?  Does it make the dead professor wrong, since I had my own reason for hating him?  Or can we just agree that some people will hate others for their own misguided reasons?  Hate does not have to be logical, it does not have to be understandable, hate is often a senseless emotion that rarely leads to anything other than negative consequences.

<br>
Isn't that about the same thing as you said?<br>
<br>
That said, let's face facts: If it weren't for the United States, there would be no Europe as we know it.  The Continent would have been under the heel of either the Nazis or the Soviets, depending upon who won the war between them.  Without America, there would have been no war material to save Britain's ass from being starved into submission in either World War.  If the other Allied leaders had listened to Wilson and hadn't attempted to eviscerate Germany after World War 1, there wouldn't have been as much support for good old Adolf among the German people because they would have been able to rebuild after the war, not dump all their assets into France.  Hell, if the French hadn't gotten really greedy about things (they spiked the switches on the railroads so that they didn't get a shipment of telephone poles on time, thus giving them a legal opening to occupy the Ruhr Valley,  Germany's industrial heartland), maybe there wouldn't have been a WW 2.  We bailed France out how many times in the last hundred years?  Three:  Both World Wars and Indochina/Viet Nam.  Right?  How about Britain, or Italy or anyone else?  When there's a disaster, what's the first place you look to for help?  Guatemala?  Fuck no.  You look to the US.  I admit we are far from perfect.  But I'm goddamn sick of being blamed for all the trouble in the world.    I'm sick of spending our money and manpower, sacrificing our lives and dreams, for the interest of other nations, whenever the other peoples of the world get their collective ass in a jam.  I'm tired of us busting our asses to help people and getting nothing but criticism for it: Oh, you should have done more.  The Marshall Plan wasn't enough.  You didn't give us enough foreign aid last year.  Your policies go too far/don't go far enough.  We don't like your President because his ideas don't conform to those of the elitist salons in Paris and Rome and London.  That's okay.  Just remember though, that without our allegedly &quot;dangerous&quot; foreign policy, Berlin would still be divided and the Soviets would still have missiles aimed at your kitchens.<br>

The points you stated i feel are correct.  I<br>
<br>
feel we as the people get misrepresented to often.  In the <br>
<br>
end I suppose that we come off as imperialist because of our <br>
<br>
power to sway the global economy amongst other things.  But to Virrago: the <br>
<br>
moment Europe <br>
<br>
begins to not take warnings over the events that happened <br>
<br>
on Sept 11th.  It will happen to them.  America isn't alone in <br>
<br>
this war on terrorism.   All of the European nations are <br>
<br>
Targets.  So you can stand on your soapbox and spout anti-American rhetoric all you like.  But when it comes down to the line and the next target is taken out (lets just say a European target).  The U.S. will be the first to step in and offer aid, without ever asking for anything in return.<br>
<br>
If American had the imperial attitude you so gladly point out. <br>
<br>
Why would we forgive billions in debt dating all the way back <br>
<br>
from WW2, so that Europe could rebuild?  I suppose we could <br>
<br>
just as easily just make you repay it now.  Wouldn't you say?<br>

&quot;Understandable reasons&quot; != reasons I agree with.  What I'm trying to say is that there are reasons which I can see why people would hate the US.  Heck, there are reasons which we can all understand for hating almost anything.<br>
<br>
Zistin: in regards to your comments.  There's a difference between seeking justice and seeking solutions.  Should the perpetrators be brought to justice and hung by the heels?  Yes.  I wholeheartedly support that.  However, in order to prevent such occurances in the future, you will not be able to do it through counter-intelligence.  No matter what you do, there will be people/events that slip through any counter-measure made to monitor these organizations.  You need to change the view that other cultures may have of you.  Should that be your perogative?  /shrug... not my call... it's your's as an American.  However, if it's deemed that the US wishes to take the attitude of &quot;we are who we are, punch us and we will beat the shit out of you&quot;... that's up to you guys to decide as a nation as well.<br>
<br>
Kalnayr:  Debt is never forgiven without reasons.  While we would ideally like to think that the Foreign debts owed to the US were forgiven based on pure charity, we all know there are political, social, ego reasons for this occurring.<br>

Yup that's how we are. We will not conceed to those who dislike us because they will threaten us.<br>
<br>
If we are attacked we will strike back, ten fold. I for one, am damn glad this is how it works. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=96724">Harabec Woodwalker</a><br>

<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Agreed, to a point.  But often, seeking justice can bring solutions.  Quite often, the goals can be one and the same.  After all, let's admit it, terrorists aren't just a one time deal, they don't just terrorize us once, then say, &quot;ok, that's enough, they get the point.&quot;  They will continue the same because their goal is to terrorize, and they want to exert power and control over other people to achieve their own goals.  You arrest them, you wipe them out, you drive those that would shelter and protect them, and it hampers their ability to hurt you, as well as others, in the future.  But for those that seek justice, can't really blame them, there has to be some accountability for committing horrible crimes against humanity, otherwise what is the point?<br>

<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->I agree that counter-intel will never fully be able to intercept and stop terrorist threats.  But it does a pretty good job overall...and if it were beefed up significantly(with more human resources combined with the technological resources), it could do an even better job.  But I can't agree that changing the attitudes of terrorists will be the answer, no matter how hard you try, some people will always find reasons to hate you just because it's their nature...and you can't change people, because that goes against human nature.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> However, if it's deemed that the US wishes to take the attitude of &quot;we are who we are, punch us and we will beat the shit out of you&quot;... that's up to you guys to decide as a nation as well.<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->I can only speak for myself, but for me it's more than just a knee-jerk reaction to getting hurt.  If people prove a danger to others, and prove that they have the will and/or ability to continue to be a danger to others, seeking justice can prove to be a solution towards making sure it won't ever happen again.  /shrug.  Just brings the mind back to an old phrase that many seem to have taken to heart, &quot;Never again!&quot;, or the one &quot;Fooled me once, shame on you, fooled me twice, shame on me.&quot;  Anyway, like Harabed, I am glad that that's typically how it works...for it brings accountability to the table, and accountability is a necessary deterrant for the actions of criminals.(though, granted, not a 100% deterrant) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ukiixqar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>kiixqar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>h0x0r!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(2/15/02 4:18:22 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumrantsandravesbalancingissues.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1702.topic&index=76>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Turd Turner Speaks Out</span><hr size=1> What is the proper temperature to serve saki? <p><b>BEWARE THE COMING OF THE YEAR OF SKULLS!</B></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ulordofchains.showPublicProfile?language=EN>LordOfChains</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>w4nn4b3!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(2/15/02 4:33:51 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumrantsandravesbalancingissues.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1702.topic&index=77>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.mikesfreegifs.com/main1/halloween/batsmoon2.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Turd Turner Speaks Out</span><hr size=1> Kiixgar: Snausages. <p>_________________

Look back to the seventies and read up on it - not just the IRA, but the Red brigade, Baader meinhoff and sundry others - have been activly emploring terrorism in europe..... even the rag heads started getting uppity - for instance the iranian embassy incident....<br>
<br>
even though We despaired at september 11th, we have been targets for many years.... <p><center>
