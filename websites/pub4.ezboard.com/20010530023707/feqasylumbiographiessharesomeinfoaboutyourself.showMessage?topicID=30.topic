Since I haven't put Ectryn's history to text, I thought I would share this.<br>
<br>
First, there was Ecstrynsiasalothosas (Ecstrynsias), a gray elf ranger who was created for an online Ravenloft campaign on a Delphi chat room.<br>
<br>
When I purchased EverQuest three years later, the name filter rejected Ecstrynsias, so I played with the name until it ended up as Ectrinynsias.  Ectrinynsias was also a ranger.  I played until level 18 and then took the summer and fall off EQ.<br>
<br>
Winter rolled around, and with cold weather outside I was more inclined to stay in.  I resubscribed to EQ and saw that a new sever named Lanys T'Vyl had just opened.  I joined while the server was only a few hours old and made Ectryn, a wood elf druid.  I didn't want people complaining about my long name this time. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
The DM running the Ravenloft campaign wanted a history text file.  The characters that we were playing were damned, and we had to write a brief history about the deeds that lead to us being damned -- and sent into the Ravenloft universe.<br>
<br>
History of Ecstrynsiasalothosas (Ecstrynsias):<br>
<br>
       The bliss of Elysius -- a small and secluded Elven utopia. -- <br>
spawned a xenophobic calamity in the wake of ignorance, anxiety and <br>
arrogance.  Genocidal teetering set long held doctrines aloof,  sculpting <br>
fear into a hatred that would decimate the tranquillity of a fragile young <br>
mind.<br>
<br>
        Ecstrynsiasalothosas, whose boyhood was crucified on the <br>
threshold of manliness, was the epitome of despise.  Taken captive half <br>
lifetime ago, he had tasted firsthand human grime, felt the caress of <br>
their vigorous vulgarity and the frigid emptiness it left behind.  Rampant <br>
sodomization and rape solidified his hard-lined stare, as he was <br>
ceremoniously passed around and shared amongst the drunken masses; <br>
a captive elf was a rare treat that was to be indulged.  When the rapture <br>
subsided, and his flesh and psyche had the texture and feel of a bruised <br>
apple, Ecstrynsias was tossed into a sullen cold steel cage that was <br>
inappropriately displayed in the middle of the Town Square, a <br>
monument to discriminate sadism, lust, and fury -- in their words, <br>
&quot;glory&quot;.<br>
<br>
        Almost unbelievably, fortune found a way to manifest itself.  <br>
A secretive sect of sympathizers --predominantly clerics and other holy <br>
warriors -- took command of the injustice, subduing his guards before <br>
sunrise on a crisp autumn morning, and liberating him.  After a brief <br>
rehabilitation period under the care of the church pastor, the young <br>
elven boy was smuggled out of the fortified city and left in the care of <br>
an experienced healer.  Marcus, fluent with herbs and blades dwelled <br>
deep into the shrouded nucleus of the forest -- a magnificent magical <br>
grove that was as far beyond a thriving forest as an oasis was beyond a <br>
desert -- for which he cared for.  Despite Marcus's humanity, <br>
Ecstrynsias responded positively to him, and during the months that <br>
followed, the middle-aged ranger heartfully attended to the traumatized <br>
adolescent, standing by his side through the throes of his bitter agony, <br>
and eventually guiding him to a complete physical recovery.  Emotional <br>
harmony could not be applied as methodically and accurately as herbal <br>
treatments, however.  The despondency was acute and the memories <br>
haunting.  Occasionally his senses would be taken by the recollections, <br>
sending him into viscous and spasmatic emotional episodes that would <br>
leave the boy locked in a fetal-position for hours at a time.<br>
<br>
        In an attempt to counter-act the trauma, Marcus taught <br>
Ecstrysias the disciplines of swordplay hoping to focus the malignancy <br>
away from his dreams.  An apparent prodigy, Ecstrynsias learned with a <br>
swift single-mindedness,  excelling with a wide variety of swords -- two <br>
at a time, even -- and eventually archery.  The spectrum of his curiosity <br>
wasn't limited to bows and swords, he actively and eagerly encouraged <br>
his ranger-mentor to educate him in the arts of healing and <br>
woodsmanship.  In the wilderness, he learned, was everything needed <br>
to be had.  Marcus also taught his young apprentice a fundamental <br>
respect towards nature and the life that existed within it;  this coincided <br>
with his natural empathy with animals.<br>
<br>
        During half a year of regeneration, self-betterment and <br>
absolute seclusion from the outside world, Ecstrynsias had grown <br>
increasingly worried about the condition of his people.  The lack of <br>
knowledge grew so unbearable, he decided to journey -- alone -- to his <br>
former home.  His heart sunk to woeful depths when he arrived to <br>
discover that his village had been torched and the only sign of sentient <br>
life was a human campsite, that was apparently setup to patrol for <br>
survivors.  With dismay and disdain urging him, a blind rage was <br>
summoned.  Drawing his swords, he bolted to and through the <br>
encampment, bloodying his weapons and his soul with carnage and sin.   <br>
Crimson eyed, his opponents were driven by the encumbrance that <br>
they had placed upon him, their screams feeding but never filling the <br>
dire lust.  Eventually, life gave into death and the surrealism that had <br>
encompassed the crestfallen warrior's vision gave into a thick, dizzying <br>
darkness.<br>

Predominant is his tangled and messy silver gold hair that spans in it's erratic thickness down to the middle of his back.  Protruding from the wiry growth on opposite sides of his head are what you assume to be rather large ears.  Bold dark hazel eyes stare out disdainfully, distracting from the prominent lines that sculpt a high jaw line, small and tight lips, and an almost non-existant nose -- All of which are shrouded within a dark and tanned complexion. <br>
<br>
A black cloak -- that's flung behind his back at the moment -- covers dark studded leather which encases a large chest build upon an otherwise slender but firm torso.  There's nothing very noticable about his arms, covered in leather with fine leather gloves on his hands.  His legs seem slightly large relative to the rest of his body, containing a couple of sheathed swords, one longer than the other.  All of this is capped off with proportional feet that are protected within sturdy-looking leather boots. He stands at aproximately 5'3&quot;<br>
