<br>
Both Sony and Microsoft are losing between $100 - $150 per system sold.  Their profit margin is in the games.  <br>
<br>
I manage a games store and, by God, Halo was the best selling game we had this month.  The Xbox is currently outselling PS2's for us by a factor of 2 to 1.  Four new titles came out for the Xbox within the last week and a half and a veritable tidal wave of games is coming out this Fall.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, we're taking in between 3 - 5 defective PS2's per week, compared to the Xbox, for which I've only seen 10 defective units in total since the machine was released last year.  And before you dredge up those rumors about the Xbox overheating . . . they're bollocks.  Better to ask yourselves why that rumor managed to flare up within 24 hours of the Xbox's release, right at the time it was easiest for such a rumor to damage the machine's credibility.  Meanwhile, the myriad problems with the PS2 are mysteriously ignored by gaming magazines and websites who are afraid of angering the Sony behemoth.  EGM finally published a very small piece on this problem about two or three months ago, but most of the game platform magazines are still wary of losing any advertising revenue from Sony by going public.<br>
<br>
If you don't believe this, go to your local gaming store and ask them, confidentially, about return rates on PS2's.  You're going to hear shocking numbers, between 20% to 30% especially from the first batch of pre-revision PS2 hardware.  The subsequent revision continues to have about a 10% to 15% defect rate.  The most prominent issues include the player suddenly losing the ability to read DVD discs, or game discs on DVD; the sudden inability to read BLUE discs while DVD discs work just fine; the very rickety CD tray popping out of place on the gears by a tooth and no longer opening or closing properly; and the laser lens head popping out of place when the machine is in its vertical position -- as it is SUPPOSEDLY able to be placed -- and physically hitting the surface of the disc, causing heavy concentric damage to the disc and rendering it unplayable.<br>
<br>
Look, those of you who bought PS2's are just as much in dutch to Sony -- a monumental corporation, that at heart doesn't give a real rat's ass about you -- as anyone who purchases a Microsoft product.  Both companies are out to make money.  At least the Xbox is a much more reliable piece of hardware, hands-down. <p><BR>

<br>
That explains why at least 40% of them are shared platform with the PS2.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rollin --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/roll.gif ALT=":rollin"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Ttell ya what . . . I'll go with 90% of the Xbox's library being crap.<br>
<br>
That still leaves stuff like Halo, Max Payne, SSX Tricky, Oddworld, Amped, Gun Valkyrie, NFL Fever 2002, NCAA 2003, Dave Mirra 2002, Tony Hawk 3, Dead or Alive 3, Gunmetal, Enclave ... oh, and a little number called Morrowind . . . .<br>
<br>
If you pull down all the pure ass PS2 games off the store shelves, you're gonna wind up with a playable library of about 20-30 games, tops.  Many of which, especially the better sports games, are also available on the Xbox.  The only three titles that truly make a PS2 worth owning over an Xbox would be Final Fantasy 10, Gran Turismo 2 and GTA3 . . . and, admittedly, they're totally amazing.  <br>
<br>
But when you get down to it, 90% of the PS2's library is *also* crap.  Yeah, there are a buttload of games available for it . . . because it had a year's jump on the Xbox.  But the only true classic for the first 10 months the PS2 was out was Gran Turismo 3.  The Xbox already has that beat with Halo and Morrowind.<br>
<br>
I'm gonna say right here that on this stuff I know I'm either preaching to the choir, or ramming my head against a wall with the Sony loyalists.  All I can say to the loyalists is that you may really want to take a look at the facts about the PS2 before you continue to sing its praises.  It truly isn't a very praise-worthy machine, with the exception of a handful of great games.<br>

<br>
We'll see.  In the meantime, The Xbox is a superior console, hands down, based on its specs and its much lower defect rate.  If people really want to support a crappy mechanism like the PS2, it's their choice.  Just don't say it's a better machine when it's plainly not true. <p><BR>

I am store manager for a software etc. and I have not seen a returned defective PS2 since launch, on the other hand the last month I have seen an influx of returned defective xbox's of about 3 to 5 a week.  And on top of that a lot of current owners have been complaining of xbox's freezing up(our own demo system has been doing that lately).  Microsoft has not bothered to get a representitive for our area like the other big 2 companies offer so I have nobody to question about these problems.  Plus it is just different areas of selling, our regions average is a xbox sold for every 3 PS2's.  And for real numbers the best selling console system is game boy advance.<br>
<br>
     For your Halo being the number one game, and still is number one selling game for xbox, that one is a no brainer.  When you have nothing else to play on the system but Halo that is a given number one seller.  I am willing to be if anyone can get numbers, that GTA3 has pretty well surpassed Halo's numbers or is close by now.  Plus your game release of i think you said 5 games this month, you need to mention what those games were.  NCAA football 2003 which is for every system, Bruce Lee which is the most laughable horrible game ive seen next to the other one which was Mike Tyson boxing, Enclave which is another fodder game and Gun Metal which is tanking poorly.  <br>
<br>
      Now, I love competition in the industry, competition is great, but I hate to burned too.  Microsoft seems to have forgotten to look at past mistakes of consoles and is doing it over again.  PS2 is the king of the hill, with 30 million consoles shipped to microsoft and gamecubes around 4million a piece.  To beat PS2 you will need to be more passionate, and get more games out their then Xbox is doing.  Game companies look at the numbers and say hmm...i could make a game for xbox and have 4 million possible sellers, or for ps2 and have 30 million, which one are they going to pick?  Ask Rockstar that question for Grand theft auto series.  <br>
<br>
      They are also pulling a really bad mistake with their online formula.  They are basically controlling their online and making their own servers so they can charge a monthly fee.  That means if you want to play Phantasy Star Online you have to pay your ISP,MIcrosoft live, and then sega to play one game.  That is why EA and Microsoft had a fallout over the online, if you notice Madden 2003 is online only for PS2.  By making all online games go through their own servers and controlled by Microsoft its harder to cross platform online games.  There was another company that played gestapo tactics like that of controlling too, they were Nintendo back in the hayday and thats why they lost a lot of third party support to sony.  <br>
<br>
     And by the way, sony is not losing money on ps2's sold, they have refined their process and got costs down, that is why they dropped their price point first, because xbox was and they could just for the hell of it.  This christmas will really show, but in all reality, Sony is not going anywhere.  They have Kingdom Hearts which in my opinion will be THE game for christmas, Shinobi, Socom, Tribes, Sly cooper, Ratchet and Clank, GTA vice city, so on and on.  So far i am pretty unimpressed with Xbox's lineup which contains mostly PC ports which never work well with console controllers, and since Xbox is refusing to be called a PC machine they will not put support for mouse and keyboard.  I say if you walk like a duck and quack like a duck you should act like a duck.  <br>
<br>
     I have a PS2 yes, but I am getting a Xbox too soon so don't take any of this as bashing, its just facts that Microsoft needs too face and handle if they want to continue to be in business with Xbox.  Customers are scared of the lack of games, and now they are already talking about Xbox2,hmm..sounds a little like sega.  Personally I am getting a xbox for Steel Battalion which is shaping up to be just utterly jaw dropping, but with a $200 price point will not be a good seller.  They do have Panzer dragoon orta hopefully by christmas, and a few online titles, but nothing really pushing the envelope screaming system seller, which they have a lot of ground to make up.<br>
<br>
     Despite any personal prefrences for consoles when you manage a video game store you have to think about your customer, that is why I always end up suggesting to go with a PS2 over Xbox unless people are dead set on Xbox.  The average consumer wants games to play and the variety and titles that PS2 has to offer.  The younger crowd I will always suggest going for Gamecube since their titles from E3 were pretty phenomenal and look promising.  Xbox has pretty much always laid in the area of hardcore gamers.  <br>
<br>
my two cents...<br>

That's not even within the realm of statistical possibility.  It's been out for a year and a half and you haven't seen ANY defective PS2's?  Whatever.  I'm done with this topic anyway, because I'm not going to bang my head against the wall with the Sony faithful.  As for which store I work at . . . let's just say it's not *your* company.<br>
<br>
Here's some further reading that I dredged up REALLY quickly.  There's a hell of a lot more than this on the web, but most of it is buried in mesage board posts.<br>

I do enjoy it when people start throwing around &quot;sony loyalists&quot; or such when said people are 9 times out of 10 &quot;fanboys&quot; themselves.  I will reiterate for another time that I do not mean to bash Xbox at all, everyone and their mother knows by now that xbox does have the better graphics, but true gamers know by now how moot of a point that is, its like comparing a 500mhz computer system too a 700mhz computer system.  The games can look pretty as pie but what decides a companies success is the games, again go ask Sega that question.  <br>
<br>
     I am not arguing over which system better, its ultimately up to the person purchasing the system and what games they want to play.  The original poster asked a question and I put my two cents in.  And yes I will retract the no defect returns, but the way you were putting it was way off base on returns compared to xbox in my regions store.  I have maybe one defect return a month on PS2 right now. NO CONSOLE MAKER CHECKS THEIR MACHINES COMING OFF THE LINES!  I just want that point clear, its cheaper to take back the occasional defect and refurb them then too check each system.  <br>
<br>
      I have to ask what those links have to do with anything current though?  3 of those links are from over a year ago and do not have anything to do with what I was saying, and one was too a message board?  The point most &quot;Xbox loyalists&quot; seem to miss is that a game console survives only on the games played on the system.  And from a totally business perspective Sony is clear and far ahead on that list and have no fear of losing any foothold.  For someone purchasing only one system I will always suggest the PS2 because I know they will have no fear of shortage of games and no fear of the system failing.  I hate that term console wars, people play games, without the games you have just a piece of hardware sitting there.  <br>
<br>
      Instead of banging your head against a wall arguing with &quot;ps2 loyalists&quot; you might be wiser to look into what people need out of a system then forcing a sell.  You are obviously very much into xbox, and that is all fine and well, because I like the xbox too, it has promise but Microsoft has to get on the ball more if they want it too succed.  <br>
<br>
my two cents...<br>

<br>
Maybe I'm a Nintendo loyalist, cause well, I own that console too.  As well as the Xbox.  And I've said this in the past, the XBox is just a glorified, non-upgradable, PC.  Ever wonder why the size of the XBox exactly matches the size of your average motherboard :p  And yes, it has better specs, which in the end means jack and squat.  The only thing the system specs tells you is how much room the game developers have to work with.  Another negative on the XBox is damn near every game out for it, you will be able to get on the PC (go figure, eh).<br>
<br>
I merely play on the quality of games.  And right now, both the GameCube and PS2 far surpass the XBox in quality, with the exception of Halo. <br>
<br>
You can call me a loyalist, a fanboy, or whatever the hell you want, but its pretty obvious whos biased here :D<br>
<br>
On a side note, out of the 3 consoles, I've only had problems with one.  Wanna guess which one?  I'll give you a hint, it starts with an &quot;X.&quot; <p><font face="Arial" size="2">-<a href=http://www.afflictionguild.com/profile.php?username=Jaiieq&charactername=Jaiieq>Jaiieq</a>, <a href=http://www.afflictionguild.com>Affliction</a></font></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uzaccheusfeathertouch.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Zaccheus FeatherTouch</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 138<br> <font color=#E9D756>(8/4/02 11:40:35 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrgeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=10242.topic&index=34>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Xbox or PS 2 ?</span><hr size=1> GAMECUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUBE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
