<br>
       After hearing that the state of Florida changed its opinion and<br>
let a Muslim woman have her picture on her drivers<br>
       license with her face covered, I believe this is even more<br>
appropriate. Read on, please!<br>
<br>
       This is an Editorial written by an American citizen, published in<br>
a Tampa Newspaper. He did quite a job; didn't he?<br>
<br>
       IMMIGRANTS, NOT AMERICANS, MUST ADAPT.<br>
<br>
  I am tired of this nation worrying about whether we are offending<br>
some individual or their culture.<br>
<br>
       Since the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, we have experienced a<br>
surge in patriotism by the majority of Americans.<br>
       However, the dust from the attacks had barely settled when the<br>
&quot;politically correct&quot; crowd began complaining about<br>
       the possibility that our patriotism was offending others.<br>
<br>
       I am not against immigration, nor do I hold a grudge against<br>
anyone who is seeking a better life by coming to<br>
       America. Our population is almost entirely composed of<br>
descendants of immigrants. However, there are a few things<br>
    that those who have recently come to our country, and apparently<br>
some born here, need to understand. This idea of<br>
       America being a multicultural community has served only to dilute<br>
our sovereignty and our national identity.<br>
<br>
       As Americans, we have our own culture, our own society, our own<br>
language and our own lifestyle. This culture has<br>
       been developed over centuries of struggles, trials, and victories<br>
by millions of men and women who have sought<br>
       freedom.<br>
<br>
       We speak ENGLISH, not Spanish, Arabic, Chinese, Japanese,<br>
Russian, or any other language. Therefore, if you<br>
       wish to become part of our society, LEARN THE LANGUAGE! &quot;In God<br>
We Trust&quot; is our national motto. This is not<br>
       some Christian, right wing, political slogan. We adopted this<br>
motto because Christian men and women, on Christian<br>
       principles, founded this nation, and this is clearly documented.<br>
It is certainly appropriate to display it on the walls of<br>
       our schools.<br>
<br>
       If God offends you, then I suggest you consider another part of<br>
the world as your new home, because God is part of<br>
       our culture. If Stars and Stripes offend you, or you don't like<br>
Uncle Sam, then you should seriously consider a move<br>
       to another part of this planet.<br>
<br>
       We are happy with our culture and have no desire to change, and<br>
we really don't care how you did things where you<br>
       came from. This is OUR COUNTRY, our land, and our lifestyle. Our<br>
First Amendment gives every citizen the right to<br>
       express his opinion and we will allow you every opportunity to do<br>
so.<br>
<br>
       But, once you are done complaining, whining, and griping about<br>
our flag, our pledge, our national motto, or our way<br>
       of life, I highly encourage you to take advantage of one other<br>
great American freedom, THE RIGHT TO LEAVE.<br>
<br>
       Please pass this along if you agree.<br>
<br>

<br>
<font color=yellow>If God offends you, then I suggest you consider another part of the world as your new home, because God is part of our culture. </font><br>
<br>
It is a shame that you are wrong.  The truth of the matter is that gods are a part of our culture.  People have different definitions of god, different idols that they bow to, and different ways in which it effects life... ranging from not at all to the zealots people sneer at.  It owuld be great if God was a part of our culture, but He just isn't.<br>
<br>
<font color=yellow>We speak ENGLISH, not Spanish, Arabic, Chinese, Japanese, Russian, or any other language. </font><br>
<br>
Actually "we" speak all of those languages.  For the sake of ease we should all speak english, but given our countries backwards tendency to cater to the minority rather than the majority the odds are we will someday soon all be speaking Spanish.  At this point I don't even care as long as I can go anywhere in my town and not need a translator.<br>
<br>
<font color=yellow>"In God We Trust" is our national motto. This is not some Christian, right wing, political slogan. We adopted this motto because Christian men and women, on Christian principles, founded this nation, and this is clearly documented. It is certainly appropriate to display it on the walls of our schools.</font><br>
<br>
I am religious but I find my self asking "So what?"  If they had been athiests would be an athiest nation?  Government doesn't dictate religion, it just doesn't work.  You speak of well documented and then tell people they can leave if God offends them?  When I read the founding governments documents I read that if God offends you then you have the right to believe what you want, worship who you want, and take your chances in the next life.<br>
<br>
I support prayer in public schools.  NOT prayer over the PA system, not at sports games, but on the lips of believing children.  You can talk about a sports game you watched last night, but I can't talk about what I learned yesterday in Bible school?  The same rule applies to any topic, if people don't want to listen they don't have to.  I hate sports, I will only watch the best of the best, play-offs, olympics, etc because I am impressed with their talent.  Guess how many times in my life I was subjected to sports talk torture... a lot.<br>
<br>
People have a right to pray in school.  People do not have the right to force others to pray.  I wish that we were at a point in society that we could pray and everyone would want to be involved, but we aren't.  I am a Christian, but I am also an American and the line between could and should is sometimes a blurry one. <br>
<br>
Anyway, I don't support "In God We Trust" on school walls unless it is in a historical context of the founding government.  <br>
<br>
From a religious standpoint it is hypocritical.  Its like going to a store and reading the store policy on the wall.  You know what to expect, because the point is to go by it.  What is the point of posting it if it isn't true?  Have you been to school lately???  In God We Trust is about as far from the truth as you can get.<br>
<br>
From a government stand point I learned enough in history class to know that the founding governement expected times and people to change and left room for that change.  If we were ALWAYS supposed to go by the rules of our government then there would be NO AMERICA.<br>
<br>
The US is considered a "Christian Nation" but I personally think we do God a disservice by putting His name on this nation.  I don't think He is honored by it.<br>
<br>
There are two seperate issues here:<br>
<br>
The governement should do its job of meeting the physical needs of the people it is there to protect.  Anyway you look at it, the US governement's job is to protect.<br>
<br>
The church should do its job of meeting the spiritual needs of the people it is there to save.  Anyway you look at it, the church's job is to save.<br>
<br>
I don't expect the church to save me if China builds a bridge and tries to invade America, so why would I expect the government to tell me how to get to heaven?<br>
<br>
<font color=yellow>We are happy with our culture and have no desire to change, and we really don't care how you did things where you came from. This is OUR COUNTRY, our land, and our lifestyle. Our First Amendment gives every citizen the right to express his opinion and we will allow you every opportunity to do so.</font><br>
<br>
The problem with using "we" in speaking for a large group is that often times the word "we" does not actually speak for all the people assumed involved (i.e. In God WE Trust).  <br>
<br>
I do care how you did things where you came from.  You, not your government.  I want to know how you cooked, how you dressed, etc.  America is a melting pot of culture.  It was created as such, and after all this time, it remains this way.<br>
<br>
News Flash, when someone moves here the OUR COUNTRY applies to them too.  Exclusionary language isn't going to go a long way towards assimilating them to our government and language.<br>
<br>
<font color=yellow>But, once you are done complaining, whining, and griping about our flag, our pledge, our national motto, or our way of life, I highly encourage you to take advantage of one other great American freedom, THE RIGHT TO LEAVE.</font><br>
<br>
Does this apply to 3rd and 4th generation Americans who complain about the motto, and the way of life - or only people who are ethnically different?<br>

I won't go into detail there but the main reason I posted here was to comment on this ...<br>
<br>
I think that some people who come here seeking a better life at times get too carried away with what they can get away with.  Meaning they might try and take advantage of certain things.<br>
<br>
I do believe though that if you come here to America, that you should speak English, which IS the *majority* language of the US.  Sure, speaking Spanish as well never hurts but if you want to live here, live with our main customs, it makes things a lot easier.<br>
<br>
Also, I highly disagree with jobs that ABSOLUTELY REQUIRE you to speak BOTH English and Spanish, or they won't hire you.  Might come in handy at some times, but it's a bunch of crock.<br>

As much as it might be nice if everyone spoke the same language, it certainly isn't the case now, and isn't really reasonable to expect that <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> everyone</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> will learn english.  That given, a job such as police-community liason in a neighbourhood with many spanish speakers, should require one to speak Spanish and English. If I were to run a Spanish language radio station (not likely, as I don't speak Spanish), I would expect the receptionist to be able to speak both Spanish and English. It gets a little less clear when you move to jobs such as retail positions in an area where many of the customers may not speak English. You may argue that such areas should not exist, but they do, and an employer would be very wise to employ bilingual shop staff. <p>----------------------------------<br>
