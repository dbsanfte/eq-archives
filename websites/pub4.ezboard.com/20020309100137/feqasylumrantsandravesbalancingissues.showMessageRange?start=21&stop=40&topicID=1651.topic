Off the thread topic, but it's an interesting tangent. I was pretty much the same way. I'd come to class, we learn a new concept, demonstrate it, and I'd be ready for the next concept to learn. But that's not the way it works. We go over it again... and again... and again... and again... once more for the fucking slow people. By the end of about first grade, I was over the whole &quot;school&quot; thing. Everyone else were idiots that had to be spoonfed information in tiny bits that they could throw up on a test a few days later... and they still failed a lot of the time.

Once you have a child, YOU are responsible for it. Discipline, Respect, Manners, Behavior... they are YOUR responsiblity to teach. Not the television set, not the school teacher, not the state. I think it's a pathetic that children show up to Kindergarten not knowing the alphabet, or how to count, or even write their name. What the hell have you been doing to/with your child for 5 years?<br>
<br>
I'd say children should know right from wrong by first grade at the absolute latest. <p><center><IMG SRC="http://www.bingobear.net/cubwynn.jpg"><p>"Mezzing a %T... you break it, you solo it."</center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/usenuvil.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Senuvil</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://warfaretavern.homestead.com/files/SPINNINGSKULLD.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>h0x0r!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(2/5/02 12:17:27 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumrantsandravesbalancingissues.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1651.topic&index=23>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.aol.com/death9957/images/sexy.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Is this something WE need to do in our Schools?</span><hr size=1> ( Here in the US, a lot of parents are pretty much oblivious to what their kids are up to.

<br>
<br>
It's not just the parents who do nothing or are confused on what to do, some teachers are too.   <br>
<br>
Here's one example:<br>
<br>
 I was in the teacher's lounge printing something (my ink jet is a waste of time, there's ONE laser printer in the lounge) and one of our special ed teachers is wondering aloud if he should write up a student.  So I ask what the student did.  This teacher tells me that the young man intentionaly touched a girl's breast, and the teacher wasn't sure he should do anything about it becuase the child has below a 50 IQ.  I turned to him and I told him, &quot;Write him up.  If there's one thing that kid needs to learn it's that he can't just touch breasts because he feels like it.&quot;  <br>
<br>
I found out a few days later, that this was NOT the kid's first offense....yet this was the first time the teacher even thought about doing anything about it.  I was amazed.  How do you NOT do anything about that type of behavior?<br>
<br>
<br>
If we, as adults, can't decide what's appropriate and what's not, how do we expect our students and children to know?<br>

Mostly to make sure i help them overcome the fear of getting hit and the divorce itself.  It's troubling when your son does something wrong and he walks up to you and says "hit me I deserve it".<br>
<br>
Her advice and she says this works with any parent is to develop some way of getting the child's attention so you can talk to them.  She said a whistle works great :)  Blow the whistle..saves you time yelling and yelling especially for a child who's beenhit actually antagonizes the fear they feel.  Also if several children are cutting up a whistle lets them know crap mom is pissed.  For a child who's never been hit yelling also brings fear.  Blow whistle and get them to sit by you and talk to them/punish them.<br>
<br>
The only proven way of getting kids to do the "right" thing is thru consequences.   I know far too many parents that cannot be bothered to do this.   Rewards are also kinda cool for a kid too.  Reinforce the good with rewards and take away priveledges for the bad.  They tend to get the idea and that is essentially what real life is no?  You are fired if you are bad and you get a raise if you are good.   You are thrown in jail if you are bad and you ....well you are free if you are good.<br>
<br>
Hitting like Nalgene said just reinforces hatred.   It makes me sorta sad adults decide to have kids so they can have a baby not even thinking that baby is ever gonna grow up.  That baby grows up and ya you gotta deal with a child....grow up /rude parents. <p>

Just curious Mirr, what do you think they should do to teach him this, what punishment should he receive?<br>
<br>
I am no IQ expert but with a below 50 IQ I wonder what he is capable of understanding. Maybe the emphasis here should be on protecting the female students with proper supervision over this special ed student. It may take him a whole lot longer to deal with his awakening sexual feelings than it would a child with a higher IQ. Demanding he learn this as quickly or as well as a child with a normal IQ seems harsh. Being mentally retarded means some concepts are out of reach completely for him and others will take much longer to develop. I agree it should be reported so proper protection for any female around him is assured. Possibly he needs a school that deals with the special ed students better, maybe a public school setting that is limited in dealing with the mentally retarded is not the place for him.<br>
<br>
We expect different things from a 2 yr old than a 10 yr old than a 30 yr old right? Do we not take into account the person we are dealing with and their capacity to understand the concept? My son is 10, I no longer have electric socket protectors, but I did when he was a baby. No matter how much I yelled or whatever, at 8 mos old he wouldnt understand the danger. At 10 he sure does. <br>
<br>
There is alot of pressure in being a parent....<br>
<br>
First, the pressure that everything you say and do will shape who this child becomes, dont want to mess up this person you love more than yourself....pressure.<br>
<br>
Second, the pressure of what others think of what you do. Always pointing a finger at you saying you are doing WRONG. You should do this... or you should do that...or you shouldnt have said this or said THAT (OMG YOU DIDNT SAY THAT!!).....pressure.<br>
<br>
Third, is my child safe at school, walking to the corner store, will he drown, will he fall and bust his head open, will grandma drive like a maniac and get them killed on the way to movies with little johnny, will some madman freak steal and kill my kid, will the seemingly nice day care allow my child to choke on his bananas? How do I protect him since I cant be with him all the time?....pressure.<br>
<br>
Fourth, I need a break, I need to sleep, I need a clean house, I want to lose this kid for a day...oh the guilt cause afterall grandma may get him killed driving like a maniac and plus I am a parent now and I am never sopposed to be sick of my own kid, is somthing wrong with me that I need a break. AND WORSE, you get a break and 15 min later you want the kid back...yes I am officially crazy now, hope no one finds out........pressure.<br>
<br>
Fifth, learning to live with embarrassment on a weekly basis, things like your child announcing to his new teacher that &quot;mommy farted in the car on the way here today&quot;. or.. telling grandma you gave him donuts for breakfast, or... asking an overweight man in the mall &quot;sir, why are you soooo fat?&quot;....or telling your boss the first time the boss meets your little angel &quot;hi, are you really satan is disguise like my mom says you are?&quot;....pressure.<br>
<br>
Do we wonder why valium was knick-named mothers little helper? I mean at one time I actually got used to being spit-up on, its what started my never-ending T-shirt supply. Spit up, change t-shirt, hour later, spit up, change t-shirt. Hey I needed the bibs more than he did!!<br>
<br>
I say, dont hit em just punish them, then when they are asleep, you can laugh like hell over what they did, cause lets face it, sometimes its just funny! Dont let the pressure take over and keep you upset. Most times its the pressure that is really getting to you, not the kid. The kid is just being a kid most times and learning, address the behavior and then laugh where they dont see it. I search for humor, it has saved my sanity. Also no such thing as a perfect parent, dont ever pretend to be one, that is the worst pressure you can place on yourself. <p><center><img src="http://www.danos.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/jellah.gif" width="577" height="162"></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ulandragoranheronwing.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Landragoran Heronwing</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>p0\/\/3r-p0sT3r!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(2/6/02 1:12:30 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumrantsandravesbalancingissues.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1651.topic&index=27>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Is this something WE need to do in our Schools?</span><hr size=1> I was spanked as a kid.  I think I was a pretty good kid as a result of it, tho I did have my ornery moments.  I think I got beat for being ornery on purpose more often than I got beat for pissing my parents off.  In respect to them, I probably deserved some sorta punishment and if you had asked me whether I would like to get a spanking or sit in the corner, I'd opt for the spanking cause I could get back to causing trouble faster!<br>
<br>
Mebbe it didn't work.  I cuss, i drink beers, i party like an animal sometimes.  Then again I've never been in trouble with the law.  Perhaps spanking helps kids know which lines not to cross?  <br>
<br>
Another thought.  Spanking is a way to artificially &quot;threaten a child's survival.&quot;  Making him/her fear for their own personal safety.  This causes deep-seated instincts for survival to take hold of the child and thus modify his/her behavior to avoid such a threat.  When this stops being effective it's time to stop spanking the child.  I remember the spankings stopped for good at about age 12?  Right around the time puberty hit.  <br>
<br>
Why would you want to threaten your child's survival and kick in those instincts?  Well think if it as giving him/her a &quot;social survival instinct.&quot;  When the kid does something socially offensive, they need to be punished for it.  Time-outs don't seem to work all that well, just strengthen the behavior in the ornery ones.  If the kid isn't taught to not do stuff that's socially offensive, he's gonna really lack when it comes to surviving in a social setting.  <br>
<br>
He'll piss everyone off, make enemies, lose jobs, probably commit crimes, and get sent off to jail.  That's what can happen to a kid if he never learns social survival skills.  <br>
<br>
I do believe that spankings when they occur should be rare and well structured.  And never ever abusive.  I feel the same way that kids need protection from the violence in the world.  Adults beating their kids in public should never happen, it disrespects everyone who witnesses it.  <br>
<br>
ON a related note, after reading Heinlein's &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; the author comments on society's system of crime punishment.  In the author's society, people convicted of minor crimes were given ten lashes in the public square.  People convicted of heinous crimes were given death.  <br>
Heinlein comments on spanking children too.  He gave this analogy: &quot;You have a puppy, it shits on the rug, you ignore this behavior hoping it will stop.  This goes on till the puppy is grown to a dog, at which point he shits on the rug and you take him out back and shoot him.&quot;<br>
<br>
Is that justice?  Some might say the dog was never trained to know what was socially acceptable behavior.  If parents neglect to teach their children what is not acceptable behavior, the kids MAY grow up to be criminals and sitting in a chair waiting for their lethal injections.  Is that justice?  <br>
<br>
There is a place for corporal punishment.  The place and means is a matter of opinion, but I think we can all agree that it should be humane.  <br>

Bullshit. <br>
<br>
By following this rule, the 'ornery' ones as you put it will act out in public at every chance. And then, if you want to discipline, you will have to wait until they get home. Hm. 30 minutes? 2 hours? When you finally get around to correcting them, however you choose to do so, it is no longer discipline, it is abuse.<br>

If the teacher never writes him up, then nothing is going to happen.  The teacher is not telling him or showing him what is wrong, at least with a paper trail he would get some kind of guidance.<br>
<br>
He is also in a self-contained classroom, which means the breasts he is touching most likely belong to a girl who is also either low IQ or learning disabled.  I don't even know if the young lady is old enough to understand, but as far as I can tell the teacher has done NOTHING about the situation....and that includes talking to either of the students.<br>
<br>
Further, what's going to happen when the young lady goes home and tells her parents she's been/being touched and the teacher doesn't do anything?  We're looking at what could be a major law suit or at the very least irate parents in the office.  What will our admin say?  The truth that they never knew this was going on, that no one ever informed them.  What will the classroom teacher say?  Oh, he really doesn't know what he's doing so it's okay.......So when does this young man get help to learn what's okay and what's not....what about the young lady?  <br>
<br>
It's fine to take the young man's side in this, but please don't forget there are also young women involved....who stopped to think about how they felt?  If they are &quot;normal&quot; students what do you tell them?  It's okay he doesn't know what he's doing?  Or that it's their job to avoid his advances?  And what about the girls in his class?  Do they have the mental capabilities to avoid him?  Do they have the verbal skills to adequately communicate how they feel?  <br>
<br>
If he gets written up, he gets help......or at least it's brought to the attention of the admin.  Because right now, as far as I know, NOTHING is being done.  So, it may have sounded harsh, but as far as I'm concerned it was the best thing to do for the young man, the young lady, the teacher and the school.<br>

<br>
Lots of pressure for sure and all we can hope we do is the best job we can.  Abusers need to be reported.  Punishment does not mean physical violence.<br>
<br>
The whole idea behind a kid acting out in the store is cause he knows he can...it is the bestest stage a kid can have.  What i mean is that there are usually lots of spectators.<br>
<br>
A good plan, even tho you may need to shop is to leave the shopping cart in its place and haul the kid out the store and say ok we go home now thanks.<br>
<br>
I have tried various punishments.  The old taking gameboy and such away works ok but my kids absolutely hate cleaning or chores.  So that would be what would work good for me....i'd leave that store so fast and it be home james.....i'd sit with my feet up and make whoever work.   They lip off.....more work.   Eventually at least for me they break and come crying i'm sorry mom and we hug and all that good stuff.<br>
<br>
Bill cosby once said its war to his online wife....me and you against the kids or something to that effect.  It is kinda true.  YOu have your battles and truces and learn from each other.  If one side gives up war is over and so is the relationship.....so is the learning from each other.  Ask any devoted parent.  You DEFINITELY learn from your child if you allow yourself to.   And ya i learn everyday from my 3year old.  He'll point out something so basic that we as adults forget.<br>
<br>
I've said it before on these boards...but heck i'll say it again.   Someone needs to start being a mentor for these kids growing up and setting an example of love and patience.   Be it special ed, anger problems or whatever it needs to be addressed and not quieted with a spanking. <p>

I also said the females should have protection from this. I was just saying that dealing with it in a punitive nature didnt seem to be a good way to go. I think he should be addressed and possibly go to a facility that is set up to deal with him better than a public school setting can offer. Most likely punitive measures would not teach him and get the desired effect. Special ed in public schools are ill equipped to deal with things of this nature from what I can tell. <p><center><img src="http://www.danos.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/jellah.gif" width="577" height="162"></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uwenenu.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Wenenu</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>w4nn4b3!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(2/6/02 6:32:55 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumrantsandravesbalancingissues.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1651.topic&index=32>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Is this something WE need to do in our Schools?</span><hr size=1> As a teacher, many of the issues brought up in this thread hit close to home for me.  <br>
<br>
I'm going to address the homework issue first.<br>
<br>
I am a math teacher.  7th grade Pre-Algebra.  Some of my more intelligent students choose not to do their homework, and because of that I fail them.  I don't give homework to keep kids busy.  I give it to reinforce the lesson learned for the day.  I teach two honors classes.  Even the brightest need practice.  <br>
<br>
Part of the idea behind daily work in and out of the classroom is to assess performance.  The quality of the work matters almost as much as the concept.  Think about it.  In life, our level of performance is assessed everyday.  If you are only willing to tell people what you know rather than show them, you will come off looking like a pompous ass.  Much of a teacher's job is mundane and boring.  (Try correcting 162 assignments or tests in a day)  I don't refuse to do it because I think it's busy work, or I'm above work like that.  I do it because it's my job.  Homework is part of a student's job.  You don't do it, you fail.<br>
<br>
A large percentage of kids these days think they know what life is all about.  They argue like they know.  As adults, all we can do is try and explain, or show them the right way.  The resistence we get on a daily basis is frustrating.  The criticisms that the public schools get is maddening, but I also can't help but agree with the criticism.<br>
<br>
Give the public schools what they need to succeed.  Give me enough books to pass out to each student.  Let me stay in one classroom instead of roam from period to period so that I can decorate and get creative.  Pay teachers more so that intelligent motivated people actually want to become teachers.  Stop bitching about the way things are and do something about it.<br>
<br>
Spanking, slapping, other physical abuse;  Like other punishments, kids become immune to it.  Teach them the morals and self respect they need to know at home.  Give them your time.  Listen to them.  And for God's sake, take the damn Nintendo away, TV shows, or after school athletics if they refuse to do what you know is right.<br>
<br>
Ultimately, we are responsible for their behavior.  We are supposed to be the wise ones.  Way too many people have kids these days without even giving that profound responsibility a second thought.  Kids become YOUR life.  Or they should be.  You give up everything for them.  Or you should.<br>
<br>
Just a thought.  I'm sure I left out something.<br>

<br>
In my school, there is still corporal punishment. I am a Freshman in High School.  They use the paddle a lot. a WHOLE LOT.  A lot of the teachers are coaches here, so I guess thats one thing.  But, if they don't get the paddle... Well, In school suspension makes you do extra work , in a very cramped space in a closet. If we had a test that day, you would get a harder version of the test in a class.  Oh yeah, and 2 points off of every 9 weeks report card grade in every class.<br>
<br>
Out of school suspension puts you out of school for 3 to 5 days, Doubles ALL homework assignments, Takes 4 points off of every 9 weeks report card grade, and you cannot be exempt from any class the whole year.<br>
<br>
I'm not saying that we don't have it as bad as we used to, but there is still some hope for some of you who think you had it so rough.<br>

Just called my parents, he got the consent, and whacked us with a smoothed down baseball bat. He even had a smaller one for girls. It was either that, or go to detention for 2 days. As far as I'm concerned, the shit I did was worth it, didn't even really hurt that much. The thing is, it didn't change me that much at all, only made me think of different ways to get away with things. I was never really threatened by the paddle, it was only a small inconvinience. <p><BR>

I know how hard you have it.  I make it MY BUSINESS to contact my son's teacher on a regular basis because i know he is a challenge with all he has been thru.  You have my utmost respect.  Please continue to be the great teacher you sound to be.<br>
<br>
Please remember altho sad some of these kids don't really have parents that give a rats petutie about them.  You are probably the only mentor they have.  so even if the job gets frustrating keep that in mind.<br>
<br>
I know i have strong views on this but understand my kids bring home friends that literally no one cares about.   So instead of having a relaxing summer i usually deal with these kids and am their only disciplinarian.   Yes i can ban them from the yard which is tough to watch.   They'll sit accross the street watching all the other kids having fun with me and ea other and it breaks your heart.<br>
<br>
Btw i'm no saint...i have my days and faults.  But kids i'm very committed to.  I think everyone needs to either see a child with bruises or pictures of one with or worse talk to a child that is not loved.  It will change your life forever.   <p>

<br>
Compare that with an English paper... 4 rough drafts and a final version? WTF? That's just an absurd waste of time, and definitely qualifies as busywork. <p><center><IMG SRC="http://www.bingobear.net/cubwynn.jpg"><p>"Mezzing a %T... you break it, you solo it."</center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uwenenu.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Wenenu</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>w4nn4b3!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(2/7/02 3:40:13 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumrantsandravesbalancingissues.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1651.topic&index=37>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Is this something WE need to do in our Schools?</span><hr size=1> Cubwynn,<br>

The problem is, the students who aren't doing their homework are generally not doing it in all subjects.  They aren't differentiating between the busy work and the needed practice.<br>
<br>
Just frustrating.  <br>
<br>
Actually, I have to admit.  I have a wonderful group of kids this year compared the previous years.  I'm having more success with them, and they seem to actually care.  I can't complain much.<br>
<br>
I'm only a forth year teacher, but judging from what I've seen in the past, and what many of my teacher friends are dealing with, one can't help but worry about the future of our nation in the hands of many delinquents.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :/ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":/"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

    It didn't do shit to me except fuck me up, I play bitch to intimidating people much more easily than if I were never abused and in most situations don't tend to stand up for myself, it's becuase I can remember all the beating from standing up for my thoughts and feelings.  <br>

    But it's wierd, if I'm not intiminated by a person I can be a complete asshole to them and have a total reverse effect of making them my bitch.<br>
