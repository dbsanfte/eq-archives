I am happy to admit that I have the free time to come on these boards and post, I have an extremely busy life and do not have the time to play EQ as much as I would like, so I quit. Now that I cut EQ out of my life I have some spare time to use as I wish, one of those ways has become posting on these boards.<br>
I still fail to see how you can say you understood the sentence, and still have your argument, in every thread that she made about her quitting, she stated that she was leaving, then a lot of friends said to contact them or check her email, then she came back, not a very hard connection to make.<br>
One thing I still do not understand, is what effect does it have on you to have her say she is leaving and then get talked back in to returning? After reading several threads that were between 50 and 100 posts long each, I still only see a few arguments, amounting to, "You said one thing then did another, you are a hypocrite." So what? Why does it matter?<br>

<br>
And I reply..<br>
<br>
I was using logic in what I said. Logic in this case, implies that she possibly did it for attention, as in this situation, it is the most often used reason.<br>
<br>
So I used Logic.<br>

Don't lecture someone on not using logic right, when you don't know what you are talking about.<br>

<br>
That's why I continue to disregard the "she wants attention" argument that you keep trying to use.<br>
<br>

<blockquote><i><b>Dauragon</b> wrote:</i><hr>I like the idea of a Torture Section, perhaps we should Petition Ogmuk to make a Torture Section, for people like [Dauragon,] Wutro, and Ghalewind.<hr></blockquote>You keep hounding Submina around to bitch and whine at her because she sometimes logs on to spend time with her friends, seemingly only to make her time as unenjoyable as possible. &nbsp;Wutro was obviously starved for affection since he kept bumping his own flame thread every time it fell off the front page. &nbsp;You, not Submina, strike me as another attention-starved manure tiller because you continue to harp on this non-issue weeks after it ended, all under the pretense of being the investigative authority. &nbsp;Seriously, why not direct this shitty attitude to people who actually deserve it - people who go out of their way to interfere with others' gameplay, crap on someone's integrity and personality over a something so simple as being asked to come play after quitting, or generally try their damnedest to make asses of themselves.<br>
<br>
The topic of Submina quitting or not quitting is so unbelievably stale, yet you insist on bumping it and asking about it. &nbsp;Find a new obsession. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uarikel.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Arikel</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 1547<br> <font color=#E9D756>(9/23/01 7:22:39 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: You're blind.</span><hr size=1> Why do you care, Dauragon?

<br>
Everyone suffers burnout.  I quit once, posted the goodbye to my guild on their site, sent out emails to some of my dear friends and ran off.<br>
<br>
A few months later, I came back. <br>
<br>
The &quot;Goodbye&quot; post of Submina's got BUMPED...by someone else.  Not by her, but by someone else, months after she said goodbye.  <br>
<br>
So she had a change of heart and decided to just play not as frequently.<br>
<br>
Some people say goodbye and then the day after they cancel their account, they miss the game and their friends so terribly, they decide to stay and try another method for dealing with their frustrations with the game.  <br>
<br>
While I'll agree that if someone posts a big teary goodbye every month, you can start to wonder what their intentions are.....Submina didn't do that.  She simply wanted to say goodbye and then found an avenue that suited her better than a permanent vacation.<br>
<br>
As for your subject in this post....Why is it so important to you?  Why do you think you have the right to tell her that she will post here?  Last but not least, she obviously didn't &quot;want attention&quot; as much as you did.  You are, afterall, the one making such a big deal out of someone else's goodbye.  <br>
