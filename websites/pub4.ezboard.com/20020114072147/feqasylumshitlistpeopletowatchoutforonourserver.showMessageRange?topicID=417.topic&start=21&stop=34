<br>
Well, be the type of person to jump on an offer like, I sent him a tell saying that i had one, and he said, Ok.. meet me at warrens entrance.... Then on the way tyhere he says, or ill be your passport to a port you want anywhere ( which is odd,  cause i dont think he is a druid, and he was like 23-25).<br>
Well i get  there and hes like ( and this is almost word for word what he said) &quot; Gimme gimme me me now, and ill sow you and runt ot bank for money&quot;. i was like, Yeah right( in my head). SO i just gave him the stupid stone, cause i dont think the quest is all that great anyways. And then He started Begging me to Take him to the Mob that starts it. I say, No, he says PLZ, i say no he says PLZ, so finally i said ok....<br>
<br>
so we get him, run him to the cat city, then wait for him to try to find the Mob, well he does, and gets Spirit dust, which is for Purifying TOFS stuff, and begs me  to tell him the rest. I say im sorry man icant, i have to help my friend.<br>
<br>
Nothing<br>
<br>
Then 3 minutes later hes in the mines in the cat city yelling for help, cause a kejekan Miner was attacking him. WEll kinda made me mad cause<br>
<br>
a.) it was green to him<br>
b.) i know for a fact it did not aggro him<br>
<br>
so i think he either was gonna try to train us, or just take a stab at ruining our faction with the cats. And, well, they dont have much to raise their fac really so...<br>
<br>
Then he asks to hunt with us, and i tell him that im only here helping my friend, and that he prolly wont get exp. His reply was a big fat  SO?!?!.. which pissed my friend off, who then removed him from the group.. so o well.<br>
<br>
And yeah, this isnt the WORST thing in the world, but it made me mad, and since i saw this, i thought id drop in my 2 cents.<br>

<br>
He showed up in Toxx and started /oocing &quot;Will pay 100 p for escort to Erudin&quot;. Even though I was only level 8 at the time, it was daylight and I had good faction with the guards, so I bit. I showed up, and escorted him to Erudin. He said, &quot;Let me go to the bank.&quot; So I did. And followed while invis. He came back out of the bank, gave me 10 p. I said, &quot;What about the other 90?&quot; &quot;Oh, let me go get it.&quot; I accepted the trade, and then he ran off, never visiting the bank again.<br>
<br>
Last I saw him, he was collecting a bunch of newbies in Toxx together to teleport. Charging 10 pp a head. At level <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> 24</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.<br>

Will Verant be including a /electroshocktherapy command in the next release? Or /summonlandshark?<br>
