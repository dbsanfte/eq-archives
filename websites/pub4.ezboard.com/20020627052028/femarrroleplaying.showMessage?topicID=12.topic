This device would change his appearance, even his form, to that of a Tier'dal... a dark elf. He peered through the mists of the dark forest, seeing many a youthful Tier'dal hunter chasing after snakes and bears for the bounty they would provide. He smiled grimly, remembering his own past of smiting these creatures outside the city gates of the corrupt human city, Freeport for their skin and teeth.<br>
<br>
Once the change had passed he stepped forward into clearer view and began to softly sing the words to a tune, all the while beating a small hand drum in measured taps. Magically he began to attain a speed faster than that of even the mighty cats, running so fast that he had to continously dodge a random tree or leap a small rushing stream. Many of the young ones turned to stare with awe at this blue streak of light that flashed through their midst, some even attempted to cast upon it, but failed as either the distance was too great or the magics roiled off the blue object as water would a slick stone. Celdor laughed happily as he sped through the Dark Elven homelands, headed to his destination on the other side. <br>
<br>
Ahead, he noticed a large group of other humans dressed in plate. They were gathered around almost in a circle, and Celdor could hear their raucous laughter even from his current location. He debated the wiseness of investigating the situation as the magic of the mask would make him look like a Tier'dal to these warriors, possibly creating a volatile situation. He was going to veer wide of them until he heard the frightened scream of a young girl. Sighing, he turned back and put away the drum as he released the peace knots on his sword and axe.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hail the camp&quot; Celdor cried out, standing a respectful distance away. He watched as the largest of the humans turned towards him slowly. The man was huge and after the intial shock, Cel realized that he was a barbarian. &quot;Whut, da yae want lil inky one&quot; the brute hefted his two-handed axe. Celdor glanced past the huge man and saw that the bandits, as these men clearly were, had a young tier'dal lass half-disrobed on the ground. The intent was clear and Celdor's blood began to boil with rage.<br>
<br>
&quot;Why don't we come to an agreement? You release the girl, and i will let you live. Release her not and I will be forced to thrash you for the animals that you are.&quot;<br>
<br>
The men stood shocked until the great one began laughing &quot;Har, Har, Hah...I give ya dis elf, ya gots balls <br>
da size of stone guardians. but the only one gettin tharshed<br>
is YOU! GET HIM!&quot; The men ranged out into a semi-circle, drawing weapons as they came forward. Cel assessed the situation and looked past them hoping the girl had enough strength to make a run for it. Unfortunately she was suffering from a large swelled knot on her forehead and appeared to be headed nowhere anytime soon.<br>
<br>
Celdor opened with a song of soothing qualities, lulling one of the men into a standing sleep. He then danced backwards and switched melodies into one of commanding tone. Suddenly the large axe-wielding bandit whirled about and lopped of the head of one of men he had called friends. Celdor leaped abck into the fray, swirling his Falchion and Silvery axe in a whirling pattern. Block, dodge, let the armor catch the blade while twisting to lay in a telling slash. The fire of battle and the beserked song he sang made the sky itself seem a burning red. And suddenly it was over...<br>
<br>
Around him lay corpses or those on their way to becoming one. The large Barbarian seemed the most coherent so Cel walked closer to him and knelt. &quot;Do ye have any god you would make your peace with before ye go?&quot; The giant man shook his head left and right, the fear of mortis rising in his swiftly dimming eyes. &quot;May Mithaniel bless thee and keep ye even if through your actions you are doomed for then fires&quot; Celdor intoned softly. When he looked again the man had passed onto whatever lay on the other side of the Veil.<br>
<br>
Cel turned towards the girl. She lay unconcious still, bleeding slightly from an open wound on her forehead. He stepped closer and pulled forth a stringed instrument that was fashioned in Gypsy design and began playing a soft song with a light melody he kept in the background. Slowly the wound began to close and color returned to the lasses cheeks. &quot;Who are you?&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;I am merely one that was passing by and could not bear to allow such an incident pass. My name is of no consequence&quot; Celdor lifted her to her feet.<br>
<br>
&quot;OW!&quot; she cried in pain and distress. Cel noticed now that her ankle had been broken or severly sprained, a wound beyond his healing capabilities. He could not leave her here with night approaching, dark in Nektulous brings hides more evil creatures than bears and snakes. He weighed his options and then took her into his arms...<br>
<br>
Dragoon T'lanth looked up from cleaning his nails with a very sharp ornate dagger. It was growing dark and cold in the forest, and he prayed to the prince of hate that no evil would cross his way tonight. He meant no blasphemy but in his heart he knew that sometimes the creatures of the Father had a mind of their own. He had the scars to prove it. Then the night became interesting...<br>
<br>
Celdor stopped short of the cavern, having been here incognito before he knew this was the entryway to the Dark Elven city, Neriak. Waves of evil magic eminated from the very stones of the hillside. Celdor steeled his resolve and stepped forward, until a dark figure stepped around the side of a pillar.<br>
<br>
&quot;How can I help you...citizen&quot; T'lanth said softly, his voice like that of the sound of claws being dragged slowly through velvet. Celdor grimaced under his helm as he read the insignia on the guards tunic. &quot;I am no one of consequence milord. Merely a traveler who came upon a sister of the Father being assaulted by human bandits.&quot;<br>
<br>
T'lanth peered at the bundled figure in the blue armored warriors arms &quot;Come child, show your face.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Is that you, father?&quot;<br>
<br>
T'lanth dropped his dagger and rushed forward, knocking the coverlet aside from the form. Beneath lay his daughter, in a torn initiate's tunic. He growled &quot;What have you done with her!?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No! Father, he saved me.&quot;<br>
<br>
Visibly shaken, T'lanth calmed himself. It was then that he looked closer at the warrior and noticed...something. <br>
After internalizing the information, he spoke &quot;Thank you friend, I owe you a life. Go with the Father's blessing...but may I have your name?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Celdor...just Celdor&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You should leave now, it grows dark and other Tier'dal may mistake you for something that you are not...&quot; <br>
<br>
Celdor thought this sounded like a very wise idea and turned to go, walking only as to not set off this Dragoon. As he began walking the young lady limped forward &quot;May Innoruk Bless you Celdor. thank you for my life&quot;<br>
<br>
Celdor winced, knowing that by saving her he had condemned her to life in the service of evil, or had he? He left unsure of what his actions had caused to be, headed towards the twisted lands of Lavastorm.<br>
<br>
The Dragoon waved two lesser guards over and bid them escort his daughter to the temple for healing. He then turned his eyes to the north after the departing figure being swallowed by the night mist. &quot;Thank you, Human. Even a Bard like you may spared this one time, good travels Celdor&quot; He muttered softly, then turned to go into the warmth of the city and to the arms of his wife and daughter.<br>

that was you celdor? Grrrr. Well i to thank you. T'lanth told me this story. I was happening by when i saw his little girl being taken in. I was able to heal her up, but sent them on anyway to be sure to set the bone properly. Yes it was broken. It pains me to say this to a human... but thank you. Perhaps out two peoples are not so far apart after all. If times were not so crazy, if relations not so close to explosion... who knows.<br>

Thank you for your correspondence, Mistress Ezra. <br>
<br>
I am glad to hear she is alright. It is fortunate that you were there to provide further healing aid to the young lass, I feared the leg was broken and it would seem now that it was. I appreciate your thanks, but I am not worthy of them. Everyone deserves a chance, even a Tier'dal. I merely gave the young one a chance towards life. Perhaps someday, you will spare mine...who knows?<br>
