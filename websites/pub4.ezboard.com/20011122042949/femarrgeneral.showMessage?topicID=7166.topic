might be offended. <br>
<br>
Channel 12 News in Long Island, New York, orders flags removed from the newsroom and red, white, and blue ribbons removed from the lapels of reporters. Why? Management did not want to appear biased and felt that our nations flag might give the appearance that &quot;they lean one way or another&quot;. <br>
<br>
Berkeley, California bans US Flags from being displayed on city fire trucks because they didn't want to offend anyone <br>
in the community. <br>
 <br>
In an &quot;act of tolerance&quot; the head of the public library at Florida Gulf Coast University ordered all &quot;Proud to be an <br>
American&quot; signs removed so as to not offend international students. <br>
 <br>
I, for one, am quite disturbed by these actions of so-called American citizens; and I am tired of this nation worrying about whether or not we are offending some individual or their culture. Since the terrorist attacks on September 11, we have experienced a surge in patriotism by the majority of Americans. However, the dust from the attacks had barely settled in New York and Washington, DC when the &quot;politically correct&quot; crowd began complaining about the possibility that our patriotism was offending others. <br>
<br>
I am not against immigration, nor do I hold a grudge against anyone who is seeking a better life by coming to America. In fact, our country's population is almost entirely composed of descendants of immigrants; however, there are a few things that those who have recently come to our country, and apparently some native Americans, need to understand. First of all, it is not our responsibility to continually try not to offend you in any way. This idea of America being a multicultural community has served only to dilute our sovereignty and our national identity. As Americans, we have our own culture, our own society, our own language, and our own lifestyle. This culture, called the &quot;American Way&quot; has been developed over centuries of struggles, trials, and victories by millions of men and women who have sought freedom. Our forefathers fought, bled, and died at places such as Bunker Hill, Antietam, San Juan, Iwo Jima, Normandy, Korea, Vietnam, <br>
 <br>
We speak English, not Spanish, Arabic, Chinese, Japanese, Russian, or any other language. Therefore, if you wish to <br>
become part of our society -- learn our language! <br>
<br>
&quot;In God We Trust&quot; is our national motto. This is not some off-the-wall, Christian, Right Wing, political slogan -- it is our national motto. It is engraved in stone in the House of Representatives in our Capitol and it is printed on our currency. We adopted this motto because Christian men and women, on Christian principles, founded this nation; and this is clearly documented throughout our history. If it is appropriate for our motto to be inscribed in the halls of our highest level of Government, then it is certainly appropriate to display it on the walls of our<br>
schools. <br>
 <br>
God is in our pledge, our National Anthem, nearly every patriotic song, and in our founding documents. We honor His birth, death, and resurrection as holidays, and we turn to Him in prayer in times of crisis. If God offends you, then I suggest you consider another part of the world as your new home, because God is part of our culture and we are proud to have Him. <br>
<br>
We are proud of our heritage and those who have so honorably defended our freedoms. We celebrate Independence Day, Memorial Day, Veterans Day, and Flag Day. We have parades, picnics, and barbecues where we proudly wave our flag. As an American, I have the right to wave my flag, sing my national anthem, quote my national motto, and cite my pledge whenever and wherever I choose. If the Stars and Stripes offend you, or you don't like Uncle Sam, then you should seriously consider a move to another part of this planet. <br>
<br>
The American culture is our way of life, our heritage, and we are proud of it. We are happy with our culture and have no <br>
desire to change, and we really don't care how you did things where you came from. We are Americans, like it or not, this is our country, our land, and our lifestyle. <br>
 <br>
Our First Amendment gives every citizen the right to express his opinion about our government, culture, or society, and we <br>
will allow you every opportunity to do so. But once you are done complaining, whining, and griping about our flag, our <br>
pledge, our national motto, or our way of life, I highly encourage you take advantage of one other great American <br>
freedom, the right to leave. <br>
<br>
If you agree, pass this onto other Americans!! It is time to take a<br>
stand!!<br>

<br>
As far as the whole 'God' business, Kordail put it well.  I am not necessarily against prayer in school, but I'm fucking sick of double standards.  In my school's dress code, it's clearly stated that any clothing baring religious symbols or messages is a violation.  However, I see fleets of kids wandering down the halls and talking to the principal with 'Jesus' printed across their chest.  Now, if I were to go to school with 'Satan Ownz' on my shirt (I don't worship Satan btw, this is just an example), I'd probably be fucking expelled.  Hell, if I went with a shirt that said 'Allah' on it, they'd treat it like I had a weapon.<br>
<br>
As far as this patriotic business, I think it's fantastic that someone holds a lot of pride for their country.  However, what's going on in America now is just wrong.  Companies are exploiting the shit out of what happened and people are eating it up by buying the crap they put on infomercials as American PrideGear.  Fuck that.  You should not need a catalyst to bring out your pride for your country.  For those people that have given a shit before the tragedy, more power to you.  I really admire that.  To the douchebag driving the Lincoln Navigator with the 2 American flags sticking out the window and '9-11' on your shirt, shove it up your yuppy ass.  These soccer moms go around and use the tragedy as something to talk about with their naiive-ass friends at Chili's.<br>

This &quot;conflict&quot; is not about God, Allah or whatever else you may choose to call Him.  This is about an attack on AMERICA.  These week little gimps under Osama's control use God and religion as an excuse for what they did. THEY are the ones throwing religion into this.  Clearly, that is not what this is about.<br>

I agree.  You are in America.  And in America, our first language is English.  I may speak some Japanese, and I'll certainly use the language when and if I ever go to Japan.  But I will most certainly use MY native tongue while I am in MY country.  &quot;When in Rome, do as the Romans do...&quot;<br>
<br>
It's a shame that these people that are being asked to remove the very symbol of our country.  Not display it?  Kiss my ass.  Please, if you're offended, hop back on the boat and go back to Cuba, Russia, or wherever the heck you came from.

I didn't write the letter, though I do stand by 99% of whats in it.<br>
<br>
FYI: In High School and College I did papers on separation of church and state and I highly believe in it.<br>
<br>
I don't consider myself a Christian. What I believe is none of your buisness though. Nor did I ever say I beleieve everyone should be forced to believe one thing, but for the ones that do believe they should be allowed to show it without offending anyone. Or if someone is offended they can just walk away and not talk to the &quot;offender&quot;.<br>

I believe that is the basic subject of the letter, not what some make it out to be.<br>

3. Ranting against immigrants is stupid.  Unless your ancestors are Native Americans, to use the politically correct term, you are the descendent of immigrants.  Unless your ancestors came from Great Britain or Ireland, they had language problems when they got here.  They had to deal with the same prejudice from pinheads whose ancestors had arrived a generation or two earlier.  Anyone who says that the United States is not multicultural has never traveled overseas to a country that is truly monocultural.<br>

4. As for God being part of our culture, that's true enough, until someone asks you which particular version of God you're talking about.  Catholics outnumber Protestants, and Protestants are split up into dozens of denominations.  And then we have Jews, Mormons, Muslims, Hindus, Scientologists, Wiccans, and about a zillion other sects.  If you look at the number of people who regularly attend church (or temple, or whatever), it may be a minority of the population.  People who talk about this country being founded on &quot;God&quot; are usually conservative Protestants who are looking to use religion as an excuse to ram their social agenda down everyone else's throat.<br>

As for learning a language, this I do compleatly agree on.  An important part of life without predijice is to be able to speak to the people that you might fear/hate/dislike.  I am native american, one of the best things that imigrants did bring with them was a uniform language. Native Americans were forced to learn this language, for a time it was forbiden to speak our native toung. Yet this good is defiled by letting people who cannot speak this language to live here with the same binifits as the people who can.<br>
Language is a large part of a culture.  that way that you can discribe somthing dictates the way others will understand it. I do not think people should have to speak only english, but I do belive they should have to pass at least a basic english test before beeing granted citizenship.<br>

Now, my thoughts on that letter from Aolidari's parents...<br>
<br>
First off, I have always considered myself a true patriot. I take my rights and freedoms here very seriously, and I'm damn proud of the USA. Although it may not be considered cool, I take service of my country very seriously as well. This even includes little shit like voting, giving blood, and doing my best to serve on a jury when called. If waving a flag or throwing up GO USA signs make you feel good and patriotic, go nuts. If there are people who don't feel that way, good for them, I ain't gonna waste my time getting spun up about it.<br>
<br>
So, some school administrator in podunk OK takes down some God signs in his school to make his life a little easier just in case some fool wants to get offended and create a stink. BFD. If you have kids in that school and it's so damn important for you to have them see God signs, put them up around the house, or take them to church more, or whatever. Don't be so damn sensitive about the lack of God signs in some school, get on with life.<br>
<br>
Ok, the person in charge of that TV newsroom in NY is a real dick. There is a war going on, USA vs. murdering terrorist fucks, and he doesn't want to give the appearance that they &quot;lean one way or the other?&quot; Gee, we wouldn't like if it looked like we were against mass murder. That's about the dumbest thing I've ever heard, so I'm leaning toward not believing it (I don't believe everything I read, especially on the internet, so sue me). But if it is true, that guy may very well be in the USA to kill as many Americans as he possible can, so I hope that the FBI investigates him. If they find nothing, then he's just very stupid. If I don't get to see any US flags on channel 12 Long Island news it won't really bother me cuz I'm not easily offended, I'll just think that the guy who banned them is an idiot.<br>
<br>
As a USA loving patriot, separation of Church and State is very important to me. People who try to legislate their religious beliefs and enforce them upon other people through governmental institutions seem very anti-American to me, whether they know it or not. A government that dictates worship can only be bad imho. If it's so important to you to live under such a government, move to Iran and see how nice it is. (I realize that it's the wrong religion there, but that's part of my point - your religion may be wrong for people here.)<br>
<br>
Frankly, I could not bring myself to care if I have to see God signs at a public school, or on a quarter, or say god when pledging allegience, etc. I agree that if it offends you, too bad, you are just too sensitive. But if somebody being offended offends you, you also are too sensitive. Too bad if your feelings are hurt by the objectors.<br>
<br>
As a side note, yes I know the US was founded with lots of God language. But the principle was freedom of religion, that's what matters. At the time, that meant the freedom to be Puritan, and not just Catholic or Prodestant. Also at the time, everybody being equal and having the right to vote meant that all rich white men could vote and own black slaves, and all the rules on that are written into the constitution. But we have evolved over time, and the definition of &quot;everybody&quot; has changed and we have even come so far as to give basic rights to poor black women. Likewise, we now allow Buddhists, Athiests, and even Jews in this country, and let them worship (or not) how they choose.<br>
<br>
So if somebody gets offended at being told about God, I still think he's a fool. I however won't waste my time getting spun up because some fool exists. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ucoroq.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Coroq</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 200<br> <font color=#E9D756>(10/18/01 8:27:09 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> ooops, forgot to add</span><hr size=1> And the language thing, I pretty much agree on.

The movement to put the motto on our currency began in the 1860's after the Civil War. One Nation &quot;Under god&quot; was not part of the pledge of alliegance until 1954 and only after the Knights of Columbus lobbied congress to make it part of the pledge. Up until 1954 we were simply &quot;one nation, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all&quot;.<br>
<br>
So, for all those right wing religious fanatics who want to cram god down everyone's throats it hasn't always been that &quot;In God we Trust&quot; was on our currency and it wasn't until 1954 (due to the scare of Atheistic communism) that we even had &quot;God&quot; in the pledge of allegiance. You want to pray or invoke god in your pledges go right ahead, but some of us want to get back to what the founding fathers of this country wanted realized and that is religious freedom and tolerance. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ucoroq.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Coroq</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 201<br> <font color=#E9D756>(10/18/01 11:54:22 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> oh yeah</span><hr size=1> Wow, nice catch Gloriana.<br>

<br>
Yes, I English is an official language in Singapore, (if I remember correctly) and is the one used by the govt. But Malay and Mandrin Chinese are also widely used (official? don't know) as most people are Chinese and there's also lots of Malays. But I actually thought to say Singapore because of the cultural angle: I think there's lots of Buddhists, Muslims, maybe a few Christians and Hindus there...then went with it for the inside joke factor. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrgeneral.showMessageRange?topicID=7166.topic&start=21&stop=32>2</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrgeneral.showMessage?topicID=7193.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrgeneral.showMessage?topicID=7182.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrgeneral.emailToFriend?topicID=7166.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrgeneral.threadControl?topicID=7166.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/deleteThreadFire.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrgeneral.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=7166.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrgeneral.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=7166.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub4.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="emarrmessageboardrules">Message Board Rules<option value="emarrlinks">Links<option value="emarrupcomingmmorpgs">Upcoming MMOG's<option value="emarrfrm16">The Emarr Quadrant<option value="emarrfrm18">America Under Attack<option value="emarrfrm19">Dark Age of Camelot<option value="emarrgeneral">General<option value="emarrfrm17">Funny Stuff<option value="emarrbazaar">Item Bazaar<option value="emarrscrollsnspells">Spell Bazaar<option value="emarrfrm15">Shiny Things<option value="emarrfrm14">Bargain Basement<option value="emarrdragonsandplanes">Rants and Flames<option value="emarrfrm13">Dragons and Planes<option value="emarrroleplaying">Roleplaying<option value="emarrroleplayingoocforum">Roleplaying - OOC Forum<option value="emarrscammeralert">Scammer Alert<option value="emarrsignaturecorner">Test Forum<option value="emarrreallife">Real Life<option value="emarrothermmorpgs">Other MMOG's</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#E9D756>- </font><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/bemarr>Erollisi Marr, The Queen of Love</a><font color=#E9D756> - </font><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrgeneral>General</a> <font color=#E9D756> - </font><br><br> <br>
