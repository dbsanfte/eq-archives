&quot;...Professor J. C. Hurewitz, writes: &quot;The demise of the Ottoman Empire, in fact, 'resolved' the Eastern question.  Yet while BRITAIN and France inherited the political controls they significantly DID NOT ANNEX Near and Middle East territory outright.&quot;<br>
<br>
The British did not annex the land of Palestine. They did not own it. Private lands remained in private hands.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;The report noted in the strongest terms the effect on indigenous Palestinians of Zionist policies.<br>
&quot;The effect of the Zionist colonization policy on the Arab.  Actually the result of the PURCHASE of land in Palestine by the Jewish National Fund has been that land has been extraterritorialized.&quot;<br>
<br>
Purchase. Of land. And since the British did not own it, they did not sell it. Someone else did.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;&quot;... When at last they came before us, headed by the Mufti of Jerusalem...at the close of his statement he stated that the first cause of the 'disturbances' was 'the fact that the Arabs in Palestine were deprived of their natural and political rights'; and he summed up the Arab demands as...(3) 'the immediate and complete prohibition of the SALE of Arab land to Jews'...&quot;<br>
<br>
Hmm. Who is doing the selling here? Not the Brits, they don't own it. Not the Jews, they're buying it. Out of suspects.<br>
<br>
<br>
From MERIP, a non-partisan research group:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.merip.org/palestine-israel_primer/brit-mandate-pal-isr-prime.html">www.merip.org/palestine-i...prime.html</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;In the 1920s, when the Jewish National Fund PURCHASED large tracts of land FROM ABSENTEE ARAB LANDOWNERS, the Arabs living in these areas were evicted.&quot;<br>
<br>
Absentee. Fucking. Landowners. <br>
<br>
In this case, called Arabs, which is somewhat accurate, as I've stated that Palestinians did some of the selling themselves.<br>
<br>
Alas, I have been unable to establish that the majority of the landowners in Palestine were in fact Turkish nationals living in Palestine. Yet. I didn't look for actual books today. However, in my first quote, you'll note that the Brits didn't annex the land.<br>
<br>
It remained in the same hands it had been in since Palestine was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire.<br>
<br>
Absentee. Fucking. Landowners. Arabs, according to MERIP. Arabs and Turks according to me. Moslems, regardless.<br>
<br>
They sold it, legally, to the Jews.<br>
<br>
If you insist that I continue looking for proof of Turkish possession, I will. For no other reason than to show you just what a reactionary, uneducated fuck you truly are.<br>
<br>
Have a nice day. I'm going to go eat thai and drink beer.<br>

You threw in the 'Turk' thing to try to make yourself look intelligent.  I am sure that if you look hard enough, you will find some irrelevent piece of literature that makes some sort of half-ass attempt to connect the Turks to Palestine.  You'll probably end up just making it up.<br>
<br>
The fact is, that's not important.  The jist of my entire argument is that the Jews don't deserve that land.  They deserved something back then, but now, Israel (Apartheid part deux) deserves shit.<br>
<br>
I wish the American East Coast were thrown out of their homes, raped, and fed shit by Jews relocated there after the Holocaust.  Perhaps your view would change dramatically, nimwit.  How does it feel to be so incredibly stupid?  Make up some more lies about Palestinian family members as well, that's a good one.  I haven't met one Palestinian who shares the views you do....I hope *they* see this thread and spit in your worthless, uneducated face, you piece of shit.<br>
<br>
Warangel:<br>
<br>
<font color=yellow>This much I will acceed to though. You can't have a nation of people without a home. No one in the middle east wants to give them a home (Jordan tried and wound up in a war with the PLO in 1973), and indeed most appear to be more interested in turning them into suicide bombers. It's also apparent that they cannot co-exist with Israel. They need to be relocated someplace where they are of no danger to themselves or anyone else, given some decent land to call their own, and allowed to rebuild something of value if they are capable.<br>
</font color><br>

Hey ass, there is only one group of people that needs to be relocated out of that area.  The group that doesn't belong.  Fuck yourself repeatedly, rinse, repeat.  I hate dealing with bigot-faced, racist fuckheads like you two.<br>

Given that the absentee landowners SOLD them the land that they don't deserve, I'd say the jist of your argument is fucked. Along with your credibility, not that you had any.<br>

<br>
They had an enormous part in educating me on the subject. They live here for a reason, you snivelling piece of filth.<br>
<br>
They live here because, over there, it's infested with hate-spouting, lying maggots such as yourself. They're ashamed of people like you, Miblis. An entire culture infected by loathsome people looking for any excuse to blame others for their misfortunes.<br>
<br>
From Sumer, to Egypt, to Phoenicia, to Persia, to the Caliphate...glorious civilizations of learning and light...<br>
<br>
...consumed by vicious rats who only know how to thump the Koran, scream for violence and field-strip an AK-47.  <br>
<br>
Manuscripts millenia-old crumble to dust in the cities, while the leaders haggle for 40-year old Soviet weapons and steal from UN charity. A dark age.<br>
<br>
Why should they agree with you, Miblis? You're everything that's wrong with the place. You're a disgrace to them. Shit, you don't even know who the fucking Ottomans were, and you don't live in a refugee camp.<br>
<br>
Sadly, you're not even man enough to carry the gun for your beliefs. You just come on the internet and get embarrassed by people with a better education.<br>

No, I didn't say that's what happened. Christ, you can't even have an ezboard thread without revising what's been said, no wonder books scare you. <br>
<br>
I said: 'You know...the Turks? Ottoman Empire, used Palestine as a share-cropping toilet for centuries? Sold you out.'<br>
<br>
I never said anything about the Holocaust, or time frames. Try and keep up here, Miblis. <br>

<br>
 <br>
&quot;Prove it, or its both you and Warangel1 who are twisting history for your advantage.&quot;<br>
<br>
Why? Everytime I beat you, you just scream and shout that I'm lying. My sources are impeccable, unlike yours. But you just claim otherwise. <br>
<br>
Miblis...you hate. Your hate is grounded in your knowledge. But when that knowledge is questioned and debunked, the motives for your hate become doubtful.<br>
<br>
Without your Jew-baiting hatred, what are you? Not much, I suspect. And so you'll refuse to accept anything as 'proof'. <br>
<br>
You've claimed the Jews had American aid in 1947, and have failed utterly to provide anything that supports it. You claimed that the land wasn't sold, and when I showed otherwise, you just started throwing insults.<br>
<br>
You're talking out of your ass, and you're a waste of time.<br>
<br>
With that said, if I get around to it, I'll find and post the data, noly because I said I would. I suspect it will only be found in Israeli archives, since they're the only ones with the motive to have the documents. But you'd just refer to them as Zionist lies, so why should I bother?<br>
<br>
No proof will ever be enough for you to believe that you're wrong, Miblis. Your low self-esteem won't allow it.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Ahh another thing Kytherion and Warangel1....you never read the previous threads I have been involved in, or else you would truly see my beliefs.&quot;<br>
<br>
I've seen your beliefs in the other threads. You hate people you've never met, who have done nothing to you. You hate them for things you've heard they've done...and in this thread I've made you look like a jackass for some of those assumptions.<br>
<br>
You're a self-righteous, sad little fuck who would much rather believe what he prefers to be true, rather than what the evidence suggests is likely. I'm willing to bet that your dislike of Israel is a central theme in your life, and that you've probably never even seen more than a couple Israelis. Doesn't get much sadder than that.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;They do, however, deserve to be shipped off to an Island where they can practice Apartheid on wildlife animals rather then real people.&quot;<br>
<br>
So you'll enforce Apartheid on them, because you've HEARD they practice it? Miblis, if I lived around people like you, I'd want you kept the fuck away from my family too.

I am quite perceptive, and I certainly won't let THIS one go, bigot.<br>
<br>
<font color=yellow>"You're stupid, to put it bluntly. Now, being that the Israelis were too weak, too unorganized, and too ignorant, they couldn't just 'take' Palestine.

<font color=yellow><b>Great Britain hands someone elses country to the Israelis, because of the Holocaust.</b> You obviously don't see a problem with this, because you two are both highly ignorant individuals.

<br>
One of two things is happening here, Kytherion.  Either one you don't know how to read, or you like changing your story to support your views.<br>
<br>
Perhaps...perhaps it was an accident that you missed that first part....that makes sense in your original post....but does it make sense now that we are nearly 50 posts deep?  No, it doesn't.<br>
<br>
You are changing your story.  You want to keep your family away from me?  I want to keep my family away from you, just for how incredibly ignorant you are.  Who in the hell taught you how to read?  I am being dead serious here, I am not trying to diss you.  Who taught you how to comprehend?  Do you have any common sense at all?<br>
<br>
Also, if you intentionally tried to change your story to support your views, which I believe is the case, do you think I am so incredibly stupid that I can't go back and find it myself?<br>
<br>
You try to make me look like the idiot here, then you do this crap.  Who is looking stupid Kytherion?  YOU are looking stupid.<br>
<br>
Oh and another thing, jackass.....you didn't read any of the other threads I have been involved in.<br>
<br>
I do not hate Jews.  I hate the Israeli government.  Yes, I HATE the Israeli government.  I hate Israelis who SUPPORT the Israeli government.  Do I hate Jews?  Nope.  I never, ever claimed that.  I have Jewish friends, much like you have so-called Palestinian family.<br>
<br>
You are a liar.  You never paid attention to any of my previous threads, and I just proved once again that you are incompetent.  Seriously, how does it feel to be proven wrong?<br>
<br>
As far as no United States help for Israel post WWII.....you and Warangel1 should find something stating that U.S. never aided them....don't find me literature of what countries did aid them.  That's beside the point, anyway...the point is that no one should have helped them.  They can do things for themselves, apparently, the U.S. doesn't need to support them now, and never needed to support them then.<br>
<br>
Oh, and Apartheid....yeah....Palestinians live under occupation of Israelis.  South African natives lived under occupation of the Brits.  That might be a basic explanation, but it is an explanation nonetheless.<br>
<br>
Apparently with your logic, Mandela is also garbage, right?  Do you now, suddenly, hate blacks Kytherion?  Would not surprise me one bit.<br>

I disproved your original quote, you crazy fuck. Read the citations above. Britain didn't give them the land, no one gave them the land. Nobody handed them anything.<br>
<br>
THE ARABS SOLD THEM THE LAND.<br>
<br>
Your. statement. is. demonstrably. wrong. asshole.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;I want to keep my family away from you, just for how incredibly ignorant you are.&quot;<br>
<br>
Yeah, I'm so ignorant I kicked your ass in this debate. Keeping your family away from people like me will just serve to engender the same ignorance and hatred you possess. Good work, slick. Strike a blow for the homies. We won't buy into their Zionist lies!<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;You try to make me look like the idiot here, then you do this crap.&quot;<br>
<br>
Nobody changed a damn thing on you, IDIOT. You claimed things that you failed to prove. I claimed things that I then provided evidence for. That means you lose. Your just such a pussy that you can't admit defeat like a man.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Who is looking stupid Kytherion?  YOU are looking stupid.&quot;<br>
<br>
I agree. I continue to argue with someone who is fundamentally incapable of accepting reality or following the basic guidelines for academic discussion, such as they are on the internet.<br>
<br>
So go fuck yourself. I'm done reasoning with you. So now beat your chest some more, monkeyboy. It amuses me.<br>
<br>
&quot;Wahh! Kytherion posts big documents I can't read and they tell me I'm a dumb fuck and that's not fair! I hate the Israelis! Wahh!&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/umiblis.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Miblis</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 186<br> <font color=#E9D756>(11/7/01 2:43:55 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> .</span><hr size=1> <br>
Come on, you don't have to give up, Kytherion.  I mean you have some...um...good points...yeah.  Like uh.....wait no, you lied about the Turk thing.....you still don't take into consideration the hard fact of Great Britain handing Jews Israel.....um...what good point did you come up with....<br>
<br>
.....hmm, you did come up for a good reason why the United States is helping Israel now...wait, no...you didn't come up with a reason.<br>
<br>
What have you accomplished?  Nothing.  The one important point you came up with, which was WHO gave Israel the land after WWII...ended up being false.<br>
<br>
You should be either a politician or a lawyer, you're quite good at this whole 'lying' thing.<br>
<br>
I admit though, if you give up...at least you are being a man about it.  Dig more into this to try to make a point for the United States backing Israel, or anyone backing Israel for that matter, and it shows how much more of a pussy YOU are.<br>
<br>
Oh and your citations?  They mean absolutely nothing to me.  Once again, I am not concerned with anything pre-WWII.  The pure, hard fact of that matter was that after WWII, people felt SORRY for the Jews, rightfully so.....but decided to make them feel better, they should THROW Palestinians out...literally...of their homes, and let the Jews move in.  Period.  There is absolutely NO argument there, because it happened.  You can find plenty of literature at your local library of that.  Jews mass-murdered Muslims, and Muslims also took shots at Jews, to DEFEND themselves.  See, its this simple fact that you cannot comprehend.  You think that the Jews are constantly on the underside and are always the ones treated like shit...and throughout history, that may be true in some instances.  It's not true now, and the Jews don't have a Free Pass to do whatever they please because they have been victims throughout history.<br>
<br>
They don't have no fucking free pass.  If the United States truly did not think the Arabs should have any land at all, Bush wouldn't have even mentioned that.  That is my personal opinion, and not a fact.  Maybe Bush is a heartless liar like his father.  Who knows.<br>
<br>
You on the other hand, are another victim of the media.  Congratulations.<br>
<br>
*shakes his hand in dismissal*<br>
<br>
Go support the American Government on more ignorant ideas.  They could use people like you.<br>

Then why did you keep asking for them?<br>
<br>
Answer the question, Miblis. Why did you keep demanding proof when you had no intention of ever accepting it?<br>
<br>
And what source would be acceptable to you? <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showMessageRange?topicID=207.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showMessageRange?topicID=207.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a> <b>3</b>  </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showMessage?topicID=138.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showMessage?topicID=250.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.emailToFriend?topicID=207.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.threadControl?topicID=207.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/deleteThreadFire.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=207.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=207.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub4.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="emarrmessageboardrules">Message Board Rules<option value="emarrlinks">Links<option value="emarrupcomingmmorpgs">Upcoming MMOG's<option value="emarrfrm16">The Emarr Quadrant<option value="emarrfrm18">America Under Attack<option value="emarrfrm19">Dark Age of Camelot<option value="emarrgeneral">General<option value="emarrfrm17">Funny Stuff<option value="emarrbazaar">Item Bazaar<option value="emarrscrollsnspells">Spell Bazaar<option value="emarrfrm15">Shiny Things<option value="emarrfrm14">Bargain Basement<option value="emarrdragonsandplanes">Rants and Flames<option value="emarrfrm13">Dragons and Planes<option value="emarrroleplaying">Roleplaying<option value="emarrroleplayingoocforum">Roleplaying - OOC Forum<option value="emarrscammeralert">Scammer Alert<option value="emarrsignaturecorner">Test Forum<option value="emarrreallife">Real Life<option value="emarrothermmorpgs">Other MMOG's</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#E9D756>- </font><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/bemarr>Erollisi Marr, The Queen of Love</a><font color=#E9D756> - </font><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18>America Under Attack</a> <font color=#E9D756> - </font><br><br> <br>
