<br>
We've butted our noses in their affairs for years. I think what happened in New York/DC is just a small percentage of the total destruction we've caused over there. And for what? For oil and money and power. Is it any wonder that they despise us?<br>
<br>
That doesn't excuse the ppl responsible for what happened to us. But how is killing thousands of innocent ppl going to make their government or the terrorists pay? Does destroying a small village of Muslims make bin Laden remorseful? Does blowing up schools and businesses and mosques bring back any of the dead in the US? <br>
<br>
The only way to make peace is if someone lays down their weapons first. I'm not saying we should roll over and let terrorists do what they want to us, but what good is killing ppl who had nothing to do with the bombings/hijackings going to do? There has to be an alternative. A way to make sure the people responsible, and only the ppl responsible, pay. I'm just not wise enough to think of one.<br>
<br>
And for everyone who is so gung-ho about going to war...can you guarantee those ppl you kill, that you shoot in the head or run over with your tanks or decimate with your bombs, that those ppl will be the same ppl who  rallied behind bin Laden? Or maybe they'll be some poor schmuck drafted into a huge war with us because they need the peons to throw at us while they get their missles ready? Some guy who's in the military because its the best job around and it feeds his family? Meanwhile, bin Laden will be in some air conditioned luxurious hide-out laughing his ass off at us...or planning another attack against us in perfect safety. <br>
<br>
Seems to me it's not the fighting Gladetree is running from, but the reason behind it...and the pointlessness of it all.<br>

And yet you will seek to derive the benefit. The luxuries you've enjoyed, the freedom you've had, the society from which you have received protection all of your life...and you'll flee when your turn comes. You might tell yourself that you've earned these things through working hard and paying taxes, as if punching a time clock or getting a college degree is difficult.<br>
<br>
Working hard is the Battle of Midway. The tax is the blood of the ones who went before you, and fought for you, even though they didn't know your name.<br>

<br>
Get a grip.<br>
<br>
I saw what happened the last time we decided to fuck about in somebody's back yard out of principle more than strategy.  Until you show me that we won't be doing just that I think I have the right as an American citizen to question our objectives.  <br>
<br>
To those who think I don't have a right to question what our military does: I do pay taxes, and I do follow the law. <br>
<br>
And yes, I do think Mr. Glick is certainly one of the greatest possible reasons I am proud to be an American.  <br>
<br>
Please, enjoy ripping me to shreds if it makes you feel better over this situation.  We all need to find ways to cope, but I don't cope by wanting blood.  I want resolution, and massive, prolonged military intervention is not how I see a resolution coming anytime soon.<br>
<br>
As a side bar: I DO respect every single American soldier who has served, is serving, or will serve in our military and I respect that as their choice, but I do not respect people making that choice for me.<br>
<br>
What should be done? Easiest way to kill a terrorist is make him think he's safe. That's exactly how they did this to us, because we thought we were safe.  After an initial strike at bin Laden using special forces just lay low, spend a fuckton on intelligence and pick them off as they come out from hiding.  In the meantime, do the rational thing, which is to re-examine safety at airports and border-crossings and take measures where measures can be taken.  <br>

Killing thousands?!?! Are you fucking dense? Thousands have already been killed you dirt ball. What do you think happened when the Wrold Trade Center was destroyed! Please go back, tie off, and shoot up again, you really need a fix since you aren't in this reality darling. More to the point, YES killing Bin Laden and his cohorts will bring justice. Killing those who harbored him and his cohorts will bring justice.<br>

Time to grow up little girl! You ain't in Kansas anymore! You have a luxury of talking about &quot;lay down their weapons first&quot;. Time to come out from mommy's skirt little child and grow up and fight for yourself. In the real world we don't lay down weapons at all. We just don't shoot them unless there is provocation. Seems to me that bombing a world trade center and killing 5k people is provocation!!<br>

I, for one, was going to burn candles for the dead and pray that all would be simply OK. Weren't you? After all, when did you ever feel strong enough to want to kill another to protect what you have or had?! I bet you are in college, if that, and have no idea what it is to actually have something worth loosing your life for. Your parents gave you everything and you sip your fucking late while criticizing all that have the guts to want to end the hell of terrorism.

Who are we planning to wage war on?<br>
The terrorists? And someone thinks this would be a &quot;standard military action&quot;?<br>
The propblem we have had in the past, as well as the present, is locating them...<br>
Many times, terrorist group leaders have been eliminated and many times new ones form. Mostly from the remanents of the previous group.<br>
The only true way to stop this terrorist group is to eliminate all of them...<br>
Therein lies the problem... Locating them.<br>
Oh, we could go wage war on Afganastan(sp?). We could slaughter thousands of civilians, that could not escape our wrath of vengance. Then we would be no better than the ones who did this.<br>
I wouldn't call the men who did this &quot;cowards&quot;.. sick, twisted, demented, but not cowards.<br>
The men who actually highjacked the planes died for their cause... however sick it may seem to us...<br>
The man or men that concocted the idea... well, I assume they wanted to hit us where it counts... they did it... it counted, and it hurt...<br>
<br>
My problem, is that we are not fighting an entire country here, our enemy doesn't have a frontline... We cannot flank them...<br>
These men are hidden. To say they are all over in Afganastan(sp?) would be foolish.<br>
&quot;Keep your friends close and your enemies closer.&quot;<br>
My guess, is if they thought we would hunt them down (which they probably do), they would be hiding within our own borders... Or within the boundaries of other allied countries.<br>
Now comes the problem of determining the innocent people from that realm from the guilty...<br>
<br>
If we could pick out our enemies and send soldiers after them, I would gladly lead the attack... But, as it stands, we have no defined target and I am not willing to fight a ghost...<br>
<br>
Look at our war with Iraq... We had the &quot;enemy&quot; surrendering to our camera crews... Why? Because they didn't want to fight us, for many reasons... Only thier &quot;leader&quot; did...<br>
<br>
Currently, we have one of the strongest military forces in the world... I have no doubts that we could eliminate every man, woman and child in Afganastan (sp?), without having to whip out the nukes... But this is something I would rather not see us do...<br>
<br>
Here, let's turn the tables around...<br>
Let's say that some American Citizens decided to blow up some buildings in China...<br>
So, the Chinese Govenrment is pissed and they want revenge..<br>
But our government wont hand over the culprits (for whatever reason). Do you want to die for your Government's actions as such?<br>
But they have people posting on message boards claiming &quot;Nuke the fuckers&quot;.. and for what reason? Because &quot;the Americans are harboring the guilty parties&quot;...<br>
Doesn't sound fair, does it?<br>
<br>
As a side-thought :<br>
Nostradomas(sp?) predicted alot of things that came true, as well as some that didn't...<br>
But, his prediction of the start of WWIII, was a &quot;big fire&quot; (or something of the like) coming from a location in the Middle East, and landing in a location that depicted New York. His prediction was that within one year's time, the world as we know it, would come to an end.<br>
The thought of our foolishness, greed, and need for vengace, destroying such a lovely planet, scares me.<br>
In my eyes, very few people are the dipiction of &quot;innocent&quot;, as the human race is destructive by nature and to Nature... where as, nature's children; the animals and plantlife, are the very definition of &quot;innocence&quot;.<br>
<br>
If WWIII does start from this, I hope I am one of the first to die, cause I do not want to live to see us destroy our innocent Mother with our senslessly destructive nature.<br>
<br>
As for the one's that devised the plans for this attack on New York, the one's that lived to revel in thier success... Bring them to me so I can extract thier organs, without sedation, and donate to those injured in the attack...<br>
<br>
And for those that loose thier venom upon those not involved, because of a different opinion... please cease these sensless rantings... they accomplish nothing.<br>
It's one thing to have a debate, debates can be fun at times... But I see alot of useless &quot;hate spam&quot;, that honestly does nothing to prove a point, or to inform anyone of anything.<br>
<br>
Triff, it is your choice to only fight for yourself. I will respect your choice. But, when it comes down to those I would fight for, or stand up for, it will not be those that leave my back uncovered. So, if war does move in to this country, I hope it is not you that I stand beside during combat. These people that are &quot;war mongers&quot;, I may not agree with them on a personal level, but I would be very happy to have one beside me in combat.<br>
<br>
Now, some will agree with me and others will not. I can't please everyone and don't expect to. These are just my thoughts.<br>

I assume your speaking of Vietnam. Its the nay sayers, and cowards, that largely caused its outcome. Most Americans appreciate this fact. This is why you are seeing alot of support for what we are about to embark on. And likewise this is why there was tremendous support for the Gulf war.<br>

<br>
You missed my point entirely.<br>
<br>
Let me explain it to you CLEARLY.<br>
<br>
Hundreds, nay thousands of men, women have died in the past for YOUR right to freedom.  They may have sat around philosphizing about who they were protecting.  <br>
<br>
Fact remains, they died, so you, and I, could live the way that we do.  Do you really want to be a colony?  We aren't, because someone, somewhere thought they ought to go out and look at the larger picture.<br>
<br>
You are totally correct in thinking that, as a free citizen, you can hide in your room and speculate on what the right circumstances for you to fight for your freedom (and those you care about) might be.<br>
<br>
Personally, while I doubt Canada would take you, I certainly wish you'd go elsewhere.  I'm not even remotely impressed by your proclamations.  <br>
<br>
My rights as a free citizen entitle me to think that you are a selfish, spoiled brat.  My rights entitle me to believe that you don't deserve what you've been given.  My rights entitle me to call you a coward.<br>
<br>
Might I also point out to you &amp; Glade, both, that the likelihood of there actually being a draft is fairly slim.  There are a large number of reserves to call up, 35k already being called at this moment, the high possibility of others being called up in the future.  About 80% of my friends, of which there are a goodly number, have stated an interest in possibly joining up.  People I never would have guessed are willing to put their money where their mouth is.<br>
<br>
I stand by my original statement.  I dearly hope that my daughter meets a man that is willing to give all when necessary, and not some selfish spoiled college wannabe who just wants to spout shit about how he's entitled to do whatever the fuck he wants.<br>
<br>
As for Flight 93.  Who cares why/how they did what they did.  3 other flights full of MORE than what was on 93 did not do what they did.  I don't care if they had some hidden purpose.  They potentially saved someone else's lives, and for you to even speculate that somehow it's worthless because they were going to die anyway tells me exactly what kind of asshole you are.<br>
<br>
You, sir, are not worth the blood that any member in our military has shed over the years.  <br>

<br>
Both quotes are yours Triff.  I think if you read back over my posts, and I invite any one else to comment on what I've said, you'll find that I, personally, don't think for one second that what the passengers of Flight 93 did was in any way, shape or form remotely cowardly, worthless or unimportant.<br>
<br>
In fact, I think it's one of the shining lights of this entire situation.  As a friend of mine said, they didn't go like sheep.  They could have sat in the back of the plane, bemoaning their situation, sobbing on each others shoulders and waiting to crash into the next target, whatever it might have been.  <br>
<br>
Something tells me you'd have been sitting there with your head between your knees trying not to puke.  It's just a feeling I get.  <br>
<br>
Lets talk about some other heroes.  The firemen, the police officers, and yes, the people of New York.  Can you even comprehend the loss of life in that city?  Do you realize there are 392 missing rescue workers who risked their lives to potentially save another?  <br>
<br>
I suppose you would have stood on the street pondering how important this was to your day to day life, and whether or not this act justified your moving to a fellow humans assistance.  I suppose you'll come back at me and tell me that it was their job.  Well, I can tell you I've seen numerous reports of every day citizens, not rescue workers, going above and beyond, instead of hiding in their closets, as you'd have us believe is the right thing to do.<br>
<br>
Tell me.  When does this become your fight?  When it's your sister?  When the building your mother works in crumbles to the ground?  When the house next door to you is bombed?  God forbid, when you yourself are attacked?  Based on your principles, I should get some damn popcorn and watch your house burn to the ground, solely on the basis that, hey, I don't know you, you don't affect me, and why should I stick my neck over the line for you?<br>
<br>
I retract my entire statement.  I'm glad you aren't enlisting, and I pray you don't get drafted (altho I still maintain the likelihood of the draft is slim.)  You are not the sort of person we need watching the backs of others who, although doubtlessly unhappy about it, are out fighting to protect what we've worked so hard for.  <br>

What both of you seem to forget is this is not a protracted and isolated war.  Real Americans were killed...thousands of them.  The greatest single attack in our lives on our soil in the last 100 years occured last week.<br>
<br>
Now let me look at your and Triff's response...and I'm gonna sum it up for brevity.<br>
<br>
&quot;Whew!  Wasn't me thank God!  ..What!? we gonna fight to defend ourselves!?..OH SHIT I'm Outta here!&quot;<br>
<br>
Man I'm sorry but both you and Triff are very very chickenshit.  Americans die and now that our country has a need for its fighting force you tell us that you would rather run away than do your duty?  And IT IS YOUR DUTY!  Both you and Triff must understand you don't live here for free.  None of us do.  If the country needs you..and calls you..you fucking go.  Simple..clear cut..case closed.  Why don't you and Triff tell the 5000+ plus innocents who died Tuesday that you don't care to fight for their memory?  Why don't you visit a school and tell the young school children you don't have the testicular fortitude to be men and defend them.  Glade and Triff..you guys..you really need to rethink your priorities.  It's your youth I suppose...you haven't lived long enough to understand freedom takes sacrifice..and you seem to think you live here for free.<br>
<br>
Triff your comment about the US revoking your right to live..that's so assenine.  What you are saying is that we should no longer come to aid those in need of support during trying times.  Triff you are not capable of seeing the big picture here I assume.  If we don't act on this..we will become victims of it every day.  You won't have to worry about the US revoking your right to live because some terrorist will do it for us.  <br>
<br>
When you guys grow up a bit you will understand. I have a three year old son.  He's the love of my life, all I really have basically.  I could never look him in the eyes and say &quot;I'm not enough of a man to defend you son&quot;.  You apparently don't have anyone that you are willing to die for do you Triff and Glade?  If that's the case I'm sorry you both live such isolationist lives.  When your own children, parents, loved ones, and threatened..you will act..you have to if you are human.  I consider all American people to be my brothers and sisters.  Black, White, Islamic, Jewish.  I will not stand before them and tell them that I wish to live and enjoy the fruits of this country but I am too scared for my own life to fight for what we believe in.  This type of post frankly sickens me guys..please rethink where you stand and lose your selfishness..if you die in war so be it..if I die in war so be it..at least I know my son can grow to manhood safely becuase I had the balls to defend my country.<br>
<br>
If I am called in a draft..I will gladly go to the aid of my country.  Nuff said..this is every man's duty to his country and his loved ones.<br>

Right, kill the Taliban, except Bush has already stated that this will be a &quot;prolonged military campaign&quot;.  So we kill the Taliban, then police Afghanistan? That's right, BRING the Americans to him...<br>

Therefore this became a police action for them..much like our Vietnam.  We go in..full force..not with 10,000..not with 100,000 but with 200,000 to 500,000 troops and we comb the country side rock by rock..piece by piece..bombing and clearing as we go.  This should not be a police action..this should be a full on frontal assault.  That is how this is a war Glade, with a very definate enemy.<br>

<br>
I will go and fight if I am drafted.  It is my duty as an American, even if I do disagree with the reason why.<br>
<br>
<br>
Second of all...It doesn't quite seem right to me that the people who seem to be calling Glade and others cowards are those who will, probably, never really have to face what he potentially will have to face. I am in that situation, and I ahve thought long and hard about what I would do in case I am called.<br>
<br>
However, I am a cautious man.  I think that the language used by our President at this time, is too vague for me to support his actions.  It seems to me that he might just be getting us in many different wars.  This is, after all, a war on TERRORISM, and  that exists in many different places across the globe.  NATO has said that this was an act of war, and they invoked their clause which states that an act of war on one country is an act of war on all.  That means they stand with us.  Mayhaps this, in some way, will oblige us to help fight those countries individual wars on terrorism.  God help us if we somehow are called upon to help fight the war on Palestinian terrorism. Talk about a can of worms.<br>
<br>
Another point that I'd like to bring up is that our president potentially can use this language to send troops to Iraq, Iran, or even Libyia.  Why? All of those countries, at one time or another, have practiced some form of terrorism on us.(Well, in Iraq's case it is strongly suspected)  I refuse to support a war where American troops are sent to countries that had nothing at all to do with these most tragic, yet recent, events.<br>
<br>
BTW, I am a democrat, with a college education...Am I the type of man you want your daughter to marry?  If you do, send me an email, because I'm single at the moment.  I just hope you live in New York, because I've found long-distance relationships don't work really well.<br>
<br>
A part of me died when I saw the images on my televison.  I felt anger, and a need for revenge too.  But the need for justice is greater. Justice is what our nation does its best to uphold everyday, and what this &quot;war&quot; should be about.  Vengence will only bring us to the level of the cowards who did this. <br>
<br>
I can't remember who said that the people who flew the planes weren't cowards, but you are wrong.  They are cowards because they hide behind a so-called religous jihad, which, by the way, has not been sanctioned by and actually Islamic priest, or holy man.  They do not even try to have their grievences heard by an authority, but yet think they can help their cause by killing innocent people. Yet, that is what they claim we do to them.<br>
<br>
I would just like to say that we need to remember that we have a moral code to adhere to.  No matter what your religion, part of being an American is preserving the principles of freedom, for everyone, not just the people you think it ought to apply to.<br>
