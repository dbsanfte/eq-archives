But that's exactly what we're planning to do.<br>
<br>
If you're interested, send an e-mail to me (SagemonPrayeth@aol.com) or Tormentcia (Tormentcia@yahoo.com), or contact us in game by tell.  E-mails are preferable.  We'll get back to you with a short questionnaire seeking information like class, level, availability, etc.  As people respond, we plan to build up a database of people who are interested in an occasional pickup raid.<br>
<br>
We are NOT going to use this board to announce or organize raids.  The Guide to Using This Forum written by Jaeden hits the nail on the head, and everyone who uses this board should read it.<br>
<br>
Instead, this is what we plan to do:<br>
<br>
1. We will choose a zone for a raid, along with a date and time.  We will probably host both shorter raids on weeknights and occasional longer raids on weekends.  We're certainly open to input on raid locations and times, and we'll probably try out a variety of places over time.<br>
<br>
2. We will send out an e-mail to the folks in the database, letting you know what we plan to do.  We'll also let you know what our alternative plans are, in the event that the zone is camped when we get there.<br>
<br>
3. We will assemble a raiding party from the people who respond.  If we can't take everyone, we'll create a waiting list.  Everyone knows that some people will no-show or have last minute conflicts.<br>
<br>
4. We will circulate loot rules and other information prior to each raid.<br>
<br>
If you're interested, send us an e-mail.  We will keep your e-mail address confidential. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/utormentcia.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tormentcia</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 36<br> <font color=#E9D756>(6/15/01 1:40:47 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Organized Pickup Raids</span><hr size=1> /bump <p>Tormentcia

From what I hear, it was picture perfect .. of what not to do on Hate.  <br>
<br>
We have some good experience on Hate, and other planes, so we're hoping that from that and general game knowledge, we'll lead some fairly successful raids.  <br>

Don't get me going on this one, Swift.  I'm sure that Torm and I will have some raids go sour.  That happens to everyone, no matter how well you plan.  I hope that you and Shaderlee learned something from the many, many mistakes that you made and that your future raids are better as a result. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uswiftpinemoonblade.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Swiftpine Moonblade</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#E9D756>(6/17/01 8:42:56 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Organized Pickup Raids</span><hr size=1> And dont get me wrong either.  I was asked to coordinate to get people there and to ask if they were on the list.  I was not leading the raid or even assistant.  Yes there were too many people that went up and that was a mistake.  But after that one mistake, it was all over, nothing anyone could do.  The problem was that shaderlee formed groups after everyone had gotten to sro, but the first few groups formed did not include us or our close friends!  So more had to be formed just so we can get in.  Another problem, after the first cr, group leaders did not invite their original group back, so it was chaos with hardly anyone grouped and those that were, were in unbalanced ones.  It wasnt very long before something came along and we werent able to take it out due to that.  Once we got down to about 25 people, it went well until it got late and everyone decided to leave, and then unfortunately as druids were grouped to tp tanks out and some had already gated, got trained again.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/bemarr.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=sagemon>Sagemon</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 52<br> <font color=#E9D756>(6/17/01 8:26:30 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Organized Pickup Raids</span><hr size=1> I was the leader of group one on that raid.  We didn't TP up until an hour and twenty minutes after the scheduled start time for the raid.  At that time, the raid leader was still making groups.  *ahem*<br>
<br>
I reached the camp site, logged out safely, switched to an alternate character, and announced my success to everyone.  Those of us who camped out safely were ordered not to log back in until the CR was done.  Even though I was the highest level cleric in the raiding party, I had to sit on my butt for an hour and a half, while the raid leaders refused to answer or even acknowledge my tells.  Finally, a monk sent me a tell asking for the loc of my corpse.  When I explained that I had camped out *safely* with a level 57 cleric, the monk said something like, &quot;Oh, we didn't know that.  You should log back in and help with the rezzes.&quot;  *sigh*<br>
<br>
I could go on, but I really just want to put that raid behind me.  I'm sure Torm and I will have some bad nights, too (who doesn't?), but I really don't think we'll ever screw up that badly. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uswiftpinemoonblade.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Swiftpine Moonblade</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 5<br> <font color=#E9D756>(6/18/01 3:08:16 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Organized Pickup Raids</span><hr size=1> Yes, it was bad.  I wish i had a list of all the people that were there.  I felt helpless during the first cr.  I just sat and waited till i was told i was being rezzed.  I didnt even know who the clerics on the raid were, much less how to contact their alternates after they camped.   It was my first time in hate and i really didnt have a right to step up and try and coordinate anything, but i felt i gave it my best shot under the circumstances.  Once the chaos began in sro forming groups, i should have listened to my first instinct and just left.  I think everyone there had that thought.  I just wanted to go so bad.  Anyway, i would like to go again sometime, you probably have enough people already for your hate raid, but if you ever need a druid give swiftpine a tell. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uyanedanielle.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Yanedanielle</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#E9D756>(6/18/01 4:25:53 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.faydwer.com/everquest/images/members/druid/YanedanielleFace.jpg  WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Organized Pickup Raids</span><hr size=1> I happened to be in South Ro during the preparations.

How many in 60, 1, 2, maybe 10 in 60 are really immature.  The raid was as good as you could expect with people TRAINING for fun.  From now on Elder Blades raids will only have Elders in them and close friends.  People we know we can trust.

Having being one of those newbies on that raid I was prepared for anything to happen but what i wasn't prepared for was the constant unnecassary ooc and shout, arguements and side talk amongst the &quot;exprienced&quot; veterans no less.<br>
<br>
Good job Shaderlee, even though it didn't pan out as we might have hoped it was a much appreciated effort. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/utormentcia.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tormentcia</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 41<br> <font color=#E9D756>(6/18/01 1:18:35 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Organized Pickup Raids</span><hr size=1> Well, there is good news when a raid goes this way -- you can learn from it and know what not to do again. So there, is a positive experience at least for those leading.  It's like my boss tells me &quot;we pay you to make mistakes and learn from them.&quot;  Making mistakes is the best way to learn your lesson.  <br>
<br>
Taking on a grander scale of raid leading than what I'm used to, I'm sure we'll have our share of bumps and bruises.  However, we certainly welcome everyone interested to come and watch us =)<br>
<br>
Our raiding will begin this week, and we are certainly still accepting those who are interested in joining, especially the caster classes, like mage's, necros and wizards, as well the others.  Certainly don't look at the dates on these posts and think we only accept the first few through the door.  The more the merrier -- just not everyone on the same raid. *G* <p>Tormentcia
