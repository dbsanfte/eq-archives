No, the reason why I do not ask people to come up here to stick up for my name is becasue then in turn all it will lead is to you trashing them as well, just because they are assosciated with me.

See........hmm what to say....<br>
<br>
I estimate the age range of Valric (or whatever multiple personality he has) is around the age of late teens mid 20s.<br>
I give him credit for actually being proper in his post. Correct spelling, grammars, etc etc. Not many Scammers/Bad Rep Arsehole can do that.<br>
<br>
Sagemon. He is an honest guy from what I have seen. Understandable where he is comming from. Great guy. Mistake happens, let the man live <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> . Stop gnawing on him! Very nice guy though. Proper too. I liked how he talks in groupchat. Proper english <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
SoD has a lot of honest people. Those that have posted. I trust their words. Syano couldn't be Valric because Valric will never get in a guild.<br>
<br>
Inferno's Hand. Keep that stuff going! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  This person needs more beat down.<br>
<br>
Visnet(sp?) never met you or anything. (I think) But, Visnet shouldn't get his arse chew off. He was just stating what was happening during that time frame in EQ history. He probably never have met Valric. So give him a break. Visnet is just being honorable and stuff...something that many people in this world have lost. Honor<br>
<br>
Valric...that name..oh yea Valric = gimpish 20 year old with a state of mind of a child. AKA GIMPAGE <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
Valric, I'm not going to flame you about the PoG thing because I wasn't there. You may have done an honorable thing or ACT/PLAY. Whatever. From the experience of all the people in this post, friends, guildmates, etc you are a total asshole. Just give it a break and go away or something..I have never seen anyone IG say anything nice about you. Everytime I hear your name it always accompany by &quot;this guy is harassing me about me training him when he was level 9&quot; or &quot;this guy trained me&quot; or some thing like that. You have proven to many people on this server of your ignorance, greed, prickish attitude, etc. <br>
<br>
Oh personal experience. I rarely have any interaction with you. But when I came into Kael and seeing you insult my guild, shows how childish, idiotic, prickish you can be. I think everyone had a great laugh when I offer you a Mage Version of a TL and your sarcasm wasn't that funny. Sending me a tell /msg Linare You know I am fully buff and stuff. Proves that you have a really big ego. You will never win against me in a duel. Oh yea, zoning to different zones and /shout Linare just married XXX send tells congrating her, constantly shows you must be bored, stupid, retarded(no offense to handicaps), a gimp and complete loser.<br>
<br>
You can always flame me. Doesn't have much weight from someone like you.<br>
<br>
Alright, Love ya all <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

&quot;tis a life we live tis a world we hate, so let us die in peace and forget that we were ever awake&quot;<br>
<br>
P.S. The age thing wasn't implying anything. I was just guessing his age range. 87% right 13% wrong <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
I never once said I'd get you banned, buttmunch.  I simply suggested that you leave quietly and let the rest of us live in peace.  No, I don't have to EVER deal with you.  I know how to walk away.<br>
<br>
As for Kith, that is NOT the subject of conversation.  I choose not to go there with you, because to do so is futile.  You have your own twist on things.  You have your mind made up that you have done nothing wrong.  And I am not going to put myself in a position where I have to defend myself against unfounded accusations.  Why beat a dead horse?  Enough people are flaming you for other things.  I see no reason to go there with you, Valric.  I'm trying to be as kind as possible.<br>
<br>
Now, if you insist on flaming ME when I haven't done jack crap to you, and implying that I am NOT the original, or whatever the hell you were trying to say, then you've started a fight.  And I HIGHLY suggest you be prepared for it.  You have no basis for your accusations and are just trying to turn this around on whomever you think can't take it.<br>
<br>
Don't you realize that with every post, you are making more enemies?  Do you really think I care about your imaginary &quot;high-level friends&quot;.  Do you think it scares me?<br>

As for Linare, I do have some friends in your guild, and a few people I talk to. I was not meaning to make fun of your guild, and am sorry you took it that way.

Okay, okay, you've got enough people vouching for you that I'll buy that explanation and take you off my ignore list.  You've need to understand two things, though.<br>
<br>
1. At the time you sent me those messages, Valric had been bouncing between characters sending me abusive tells.  When you sent me the first message, I was in the middle of a crisis in Hate, and I didn't even notice the name.  I think I just told Tormentcia something like, &quot;Jeez, Valric's still sending me tells.&quot;  The next day, you re-sent the tell and went straight onto my /ignore list.<br>
<br>
2. Even though you seem nothing like Valric, there are times when Valric doesn't seem like Valric either.  He is capable of coming off as totally calm and reasonable and polite.  It's only when you begin pressing him that the real Valric comes out.  When Vishanti sent me a tell on this subject a couple days ago, I could tell that she was worried that you *might* have been Valric all along. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uiceweaselx.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ice Weasel X</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 131<br> <font color=#E9D756>(8/17/01 8:13:57 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Valric Flaming 2.0</span><hr size=1> <blockquote><i><b>Valric 1.02</b> (anyone else sick of people flaunting their IQs?) wrote:</i><hr>People make mistakes huh?

Valric responded to everyone after I posted, and still can't come up with anything other than an, "It wasn't me." &nbsp;This is the same story he gave everyone before he broke down and admitted it was him. &nbsp;Going back and forth between stories tends to kill your credibility. &nbsp;Feel free to point fingers at everyone else who has a problem with you. &nbsp;No one believes a liar. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/utormentcia.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tormentcia</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 185<br> <font color=#E9D756>(8/17/01 10:06:18 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Valric Flaming 2.0</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> .

Sorry, was in shock .. he actually does know the word &quot;sorry&quot;. <br>
<br>
Valric -- you really must have that many people disliking you to remember who they all are and why.  You sit there and claim &quot;oh, you've never met with me or played with me in game&quot;.  Oh, guess what?  I have in Hate.  One time.  That was enough and I won't do it again.  <br>
<br>
You can sit there and whine and make excuses that people are making things up about you all you want but the truth of the matter is that is all you are -- a whiney, selfish fuck up that no one wants to be around or have anything to do with.  Proof has been given to you, on this board that your actions and words are VERY worth flaming and you have earned your poor reputation 10 times over.  <br>

Yeah, it does suck to have a whole slew of people on a computer game, most of whom you will never meet, dislike you so bad.  They don't get a chance to know the &quot;real you&quot;, but then again, maybe they already do.  I would imagine you spend so much time here because you've already managed to piss off every living being within 10 miles of you RL.  Maybe we should notify the Guinness Book about you -- person to have pissed off the most people in the most different countries.  Interesting feat you have there dick brain.<br>

its just started to become a &quot;well, you're dumb&quot; and &quot;well, you're stupid&quot; kinda thing now...just let it go, Valric's gotten his i'd say. i'm not supporting Valric or his actions, but this is getting to be too much.<br>
