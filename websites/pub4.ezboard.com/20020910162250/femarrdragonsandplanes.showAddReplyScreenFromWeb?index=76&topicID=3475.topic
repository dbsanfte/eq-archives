<br>
1.  So does life imprisonment without parole.  It is for that reason that supporters of DP usually claim deterrence as a justification, although not a single study has ever said it deters crime.<br>
<br>
2.  Separation of Church and State has nothing to do with and individual person's beliefs regarding whether something is right and wrong.  The Separation is also irrelevant as to the motivations of any particular voter, legislator or judge.<br>
<br>
3.  The fact that we can be wrong, and are, demonstrates that the punishment is cruel and unusual for there is nothing we can do to even partially make amends if we learn we screwed up.  It's not the method that is cruel, but the sentence itself. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uskerrynb.showPublicProfile?language=EN>SkerryNB</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_ball.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 84<br> <font color=#E9D756>(7/19/02 12:39:33 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3475.topic&index=77>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: hmm</span><hr size=1> Skerry: I think the same holds true for anyone that automatically tosses out the reasoning, explanation or argument of someone, merely because they happen to hold certain beliefs.<br>
---------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
This is true.<br>
<br>
However,  I have always debated/argued with both sides in mind.  I can do it quite well.  The problem arises when you realize the other person is not in any way capable of doing the same thing. <br>
<br>
The reason for my statement was simply to say,  unlike so many other people on these boards,  I was backing out.  There is no point going forward because he firmly feels the way he does, with the bible and some misinformation to back him.   Personally,  the bible isn't enough, however I will not attempt to drill my beliefs on him just because of that.  And so,  I back out.  <br>
<br>
See,  the reason half of the threads on this board go on and on and on and on (like this one will) is because people just dont seem to see that some issues there is no correct answer.<br>
<br>
Am I right here?  To me I certainly am.  Is he right here?  To him he certainly is,   likewise he thinks I am wrong and I think he is wrong. . but what is the point in smacking our heads together.  <br>
<br>
The death penalty unfortunatly is one of those topics that will never have a satisfactory answer.  Just like abortion, religion, politics, gun control or homosexuality.   It is a debate based not on fact, but on feeling.  Once you get feeling into a debate, the debate is over because there is nothing anyone can truly do to change something someone truly believes.<br>
<br>
Unless of course they are beign an idiot but in that case you can bring up fact and or common sense to prove them wrong.  That however, is not the case here.<br>
<br>
As for your comment, attempting to take a jab at me (that was after all the only possible purpose for pulling that one line out).   You are correct,  when it comes to the death penalty, there is nothing you or anyone else can say that wil make me see a reason why people like this guy in california should not be put down like a rabid dog.   I do also have very strong animosity to anyone who thinks someone like this should be given a second chance, given the chance to make right, given the opportunity to be a better person.   <br>
<br>
Have a great day.<br>

So you say that I have no facts - but then you go on to say you base your entire agrument on feelings.<br>
<br>
Fact:  it costs more to kill someone than imprison them for as long as they live.<br>
<br>
Fact:  death penalty does not deter crime<br>
<br>
Fact:  There is enough error in the system that states like Illinois recently released a bunch of people on death row and put the death penalty on hold possibly to stop doing it<br>
<br>
Fact:  If you kill an innocent person then you have commited murder<br>
<br>
Fact:  If there is error in the system then the ultimate punishment (death) is not a correct one to make<br>
<br>
So what exactly makes you so justified and perfect that you know for sure that you have the right person?  Yes you can do DNA testing - but the fact remains that even with the possibilites being insanely remote - there does exist a possibility that 2 people with simlar DNA can exsist in the same area.  There is NO perfect system, and no - I'm not saying it's likely - but wierder things have happened in the world.<br>

Next, they think they have the piece of @#%$ who did this.  He was charged 2 years ago with molesting two girls under the age of 14 but was acquitted.  Does this sound like he wouldn't do it again.  Should he have a chance to ever get out/escape/etc.. NO.  Kill the bastard if he's found guilty and be done.

<br>
<br>
Okay.  you want to keep going   FINE.<br>
<br>
<br>
First however (and I hope noone is watching)..<br>
Skerry: I wasn't trying to take a jab, but pointing out that you were engaging in the same conduct for which you were condemning Ckorik. .<br>
<br>
This may be the only time I say this raed,  but  you are correct in this case, and I do believe I admitted and owned up to it in this case as well.<br>
<br>
Anyway, onto Ckorik.<br>
<br>
Fact: it costs more to kill someone than imprison them for as long as they live.<br>
  -  Hard to claim fact with no facts behind it.  I know you say appeals process,  however appeals process doesnt happenin every case, and appeals at best go over a few years,  not the entire course of a man's life to feed, clothe, entertain, and pay.  However, until I get facts of my own I will lety ou have your thought on this,  but will retain mine as well.<br>
<br>
Fact: death penalty does not deter crime<br>
  - Again a belief of yours.   Let me ask you though.  If a person kills someone, and is let go, what is to prevent them from doing it again?  Nothing,  nothing at all.  Because in fact, and this IS fact,  many prisoners do things to go back because they can't hack it outside.  I know this for fact because I know of 1 and have been in the counseling sessions regarding him and have heard the shrinks and read the literature.<br>
  - However,  and I Will give you this one because when arugments like this happen I do try to be a little informed.  The fact that in many cases the death penalty INCREASED violent crimes, the criminal in these cases wanting to die and using the system to do it,  is enough to put a twist in the thought, but not quite enough to change the mind.<br>
<br>
<br>
   - Working with the thought however that it may not deter it,  but it sure would stop the second and third repeat offeners (who we catch and they get to go).  THat is enough for me (at this point) to still back it.<br>
<br>
Fact: There is enough error in the system that states like Illinois recently released a bunch of people on death row and put the death penalty on hold possibly to stop doing it<br>
<br>
      This isn't (to me ) a case against capital punishment.  What this is (again to me) is a sample of the errors in it, whic hyes would need to be rectified before CP was a blanket punishment.<br>
<br>
<br>
Fact: If you kill an innocent person then you have commited murder<br>
    - NO argument here,  I am not an idiot,  nor blind. Please do not insult my intelligence. I am trying not to insult yours.<br>
<br>
<br>
 Fact: If there is error in the system then the ultimate punishment (death) is not a correct one to make<br>
   - Sure, if there is doubt (and the judge I have always believed should have a say in the punishment .. Actually I do believe they do for the sentencing hearings...   However,   what I am talking about. . are clear cases.  They do occur. Fingerprints, DNA, Witnesses,  basically there is no way the guy couldnt have done it or at the very least VERY VERY little doubt. .. then the Death Penalty sould stand firm.  There are a lot of cases I have seen that people have screamed death penalty and I have not thought that,  it didnt seem solid enough.  However,  many more are solid enough to bank on it.<br>
<br>
<br>
**So what exactly makes you so justified and perfect that you know for sure that you have the right person? Yes you can do DNA testing - but the fact remains that even with the possibilites being insanely remote - there does exist a possibility that 2 people with simlar DNA can exsist in the same area. There is NO perfect system, and no - I'm not saying it's likely - but wierder things have happened in the world.**<br>
    Not one damn thing.  Except that (using your case) if DNA matches and the rest of the case is solid,  that is enough for me.  The bottom line is,  I have kids.   This is important now.<br>
   If a bad guy did something bad to a child in this town or to somene, anyone.  And the choice came down to let him go to prison where he COULD get out,  or put him to death.  I would opt for the death.  <br>
<br>
<br>
Simply because if that person got out,  and did something to my child,  or my wife,  and I had the chance to stop it.   That is not a risk I am willing to take.  You are, and that is fine.  I am not.  God forbig I am ever in that situation, because it would be hard. . but,  it is the lesser of two evils in my book.<br>

Despite your childish little dig in the other thread, I can read really well.  You admitted you were close-minded on the issue, but that doesn't exclude your comment outside the issues.  Whatever, twerp.<br>
<br>
And now, because I've feeling magnanimous, the response to your &quot;substantive&quot; argument.<br>
<br>
1.  Go read DeathPenaltyWatch.com or the other resources I've cited in this thread regarding costs between life in prison and death penalty.  And yes, appeals happen in every death penalty case.  There are mandatory appeals in every state (even the death capital, Texas) regarding a finding of capitol punishment.<br>
<br>
2.  If a person kills and is let go, then the death penalty is irrelevant.  They weren't convicted in the first place.  Again, read the sources identified since you clearly won't take our word for it.  All the studies indicate that death is not a deterrent because criminals don't believe they will get caught, so the penalty is irrelevant to them.  And life in prison w/o parole is just as effective in deterring a repeat offense.<br>
<br>
3.  The burden of proof in criminal court is beyond a reasonable doubt.  That's supposed to take into account everything you mentioned, yet folks get wrongly convicted all the time.  And the Supreme Court recently determined that the Judge should not have anything to do with the death penalty (which is what caused Moussaoui to be re-arraigned yesterday). <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uskerrynb.showPublicProfile?language=EN>SkerryNB</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_ball.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 87<br> <font color=#E9D756>(7/19/02 5:14:37 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3475.topic&index=85>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: hmm</span><hr size=1> Bigotry and Hippocracy?<br>

Bringing your comment from the other thread here...<br>
<br>
<br>
Nothing you could say could embarass me because it has no merit.<br>
<br>
What I fail to understand,  is how you label me a bigot and a hipocrate when I am TRYIGN to point out that this argument cannot have a resolution.  I AM TRYGIN to agree to disagree,  which for some reason you just can't accept.<br>
<br>
Not being able to accept an outcome of agreeable disagreement is beyond any level of idiocy I have ever seen.<br>
<br>
Please,  don't hurt yourself trying to come up with a reply because while I tried to be nice and answer you, thinking you would understand agreeable disagreement and get a normal conversation that you so proudly boast about being capable of, I will not make that mistake again.  All it seems to get is wild accusations and left field comments.<br>
<br>
Maybe your points at the bottom of your post had merit,  I really don't know.  Pulling bigotry and hippocracy out of your ass was enough to let me know you aren't capable of rational thought.<br>
<br>
Enjoy.<br>
<br>
CK feel free to resopnd if you want,  you actually have thought behind your responses, and while again I am trying to agree that we think differently (how many times do I have to say this I wonder),  some of what you say is interesting.<br>

What is there to argue with - I state my facts - you throw them out, without one shred of evidcence to show me I'm wrong.  You are trying to change my opinion here - I didn't go looking for you - you came here and tried to tell me that I was wrong.<br>
<br>
So here are some interesting things:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> In Texas, a death penalty case costs an average of $2.3 million, about three times the cost of imprisoning someone in a single cell at the highest security level for 40 years. (Dallas Morning News, March 8, 1992).<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
There ya go - it costs more.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> In this study, author William Bailey speculated that if executions had a deterrent effect in Oklahoma, it would be observable by comparing murder rates and rates of sub-types of murder, such as felony-murder, stranger robbery-related killings, stranger non-felony murder, and argument-related killings, before and after the resumption of executions. Bailey examined the period between 1989 and 1991 for total killings and sub-types of killing. After controlling for a number of variables, Bailey found that there was no evidence for a deterrent effect. He did, however, find that there was a significant increase in stranger killings and non-felony stranger killings after Oklahoma resumed executions after a 25-year moratorium. (36 Criminology 711-33 (199<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ). <br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
There ya go - it does not have a deterrence effect - if anything all it does is make our society more barbaric and apt to call for 'vengance' upon the convicted.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>
<br>
<br>
The number of innocent defendants released from death row has been steadily increasing over recent years. Between 1973 and October, 1993, there was an average of 2.75 innocent defendants released. Since then, the average has increased to 5 released per year. <br>
<br>
Total Exonerations Since 1973: 101 <br>
<br>
Exonerations in 2002: 3 <br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
And there ya go - innocent people are convicted and put on death row all the time - who knows how many are dead now - no one - because the dead tell no tales.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Simply because if that person got out, and did something to my child, or my wife, and I had the chance to stop it. That is not a risk I am willing to take. You are, and that is fine. I am not. God forbig I am ever in that situation, because it would be hard. . but, it is the lesser of two evils in my book.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Again you assume that the person is going to get out - there is the possibility for life without parole - not 22 years life - but the rest of your natural life.<br>

I have worked in the area of law enforcement for the majority of my adult life (over 30 years). I have had friends and co-workers gunned down by lifeless scumbags throughout that period of time. I have had to fingerprint the body of, and photograph the autopsey of a friend, who only wanted to make things better. I have always been a staunch supporter of Capital Punishment, but have always disagreed with the way it is carried out. Capital punishment today is not really a deterent. It needs to be carried out in public, with the condemed dying in the same manner that he took a life. Stabbing, shooting, strangulation, it does not matter. The condemed should die in the same manner, in public, with maximum shame. That would be a deterent. I also feel that the appeals process takes much too long. Why should the population in general have to support the lowlife for years and years of appeals? In Mississipi it costs approximately $45,000.00 a year to keep someone on Death Row. Why should the taxpayers have to carry this burden? Maybe if the condem persons family had to bare that burden, he, she, or it would have thought twice before taking an innocents life. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uheliuswallace.showPublicProfile?language=EN>helius wallace</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 718<br> <font color=#E9D756>(7/19/02 9:24:06 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3475.topic&index=92>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: hmm</span><hr size=1> Umm, Glazier, I hate to derail you as others have, but the appeals sometimes happen for a reason: The person may be innocent. <br>

I hope you were not actually supporting public executions. Why don't we just go back to torture as a deterent?<br>

This is the price our people pay for NOT being put to death for doing nothing. How would you feel if YOU were in the wrong place at the wrong time, and you were NOT offered an appeal?<br>

I'm sorry for nitpicking, I just can't agree with anything in your post. Perhaps it's too conservitive for me, or perhaps it just doesn't follow the same constitution as me.

Kinda hard to call these facts when you have no actuall facts to cite. <br>
<br>
(-Fact: it costs more to kill someone than imprison them for as long as they live.)<br>
It may but thats only because of the exhaustive appeals process. The costs are weighed with the expenditures of lawyers and court time<br>
<br>
(Fact: death penalty does not deter crime)<br>
I'll argue this one with you until the damn cows come home. Especially since you offer no evidence for your &quot;fact&quot;. Truth is the death penalty would probably deter a lot more crime if it were actually used as intended<br>
<br>
(Fact: If you kill an innocent person then you have commited murder)<br>
Thats not only not a fact its flat out wrong. The death penalty is legal when carried out and therefore under the legal definition is not murder. I could care less what flaky ass definition that YOU want to use. I prefer to stick with whats written in these nice little things called statutes. Id provide you some links but linking the legal statutes to all 50 states would be repetative. If you wanna see for yourself in just one state have a visit to <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.legis.state.la.us/tsrs/search.htm">www.legis.state.la.us/tsrs/search.htm</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--> to take a look for the legal definition for murder. <br>
<br>
(Yes you can do DNA testing - but the fact remains that even with the possibilites being insanely remote - there does exist a possibility that 2 people with simlar DNA can exsist in the same area)<br>
Erm... no. Similar DNA doesnt mean same DNA. Man dont quit your day job. You argue like a child. <br>
<br>
(I state my facts )<br>
Youre not stating facts. Youre throwing out speculation without any evidence from an unbiased 3rd party whatsoever and then want to claim its fact. Its so ameture it makes me want to go find a &quot;Debate for Dummies&quot; book and smack you about the head with it multiple times. <br>
<br>
Look,  Im not saying I have all the answers but I sure as hell am saying that you dont either. You arent the authority on the bible. You arent the authority on morality and I highly doubt you are any type of authority on death penalty and law in any state seeing as you have yet to vomit forth anything but speculation. Why cant you just drop the damn arrogant act for a minute and accept these things as your OPINION. Meaning that its your right to hold these thoughts but it doesnt make them the right thoughts.
