<br>
Underpaid is a relative term. If you believe they are underpaid in an &quot;economic&quot; sense, then that wouldn't be the case. In the most extreme economics, no one is underpaid (and no one is overpaid). Supply of labour will equal the demand for labour. <br>
<br>
Look at the amount of people applying for teachers college. It's mind boggling. That's why teachers salaries are so low.<br>
<br>
Why are lawyers salaries so high? Because they restrict entry by BAR exams etc, and restrict the entrance of lawyers into the field.<br>

<br>
If everyone has control over every dollar they earn, then there's gonna be a heck of a lot of people who are starving to death. Re-distrubtion of income is a necessaity. And not only does it have economic benefits, it also has cultural, social, and demographic benefits as well.<br>

Your artist law is a perfect example of your obvious inability to comprehend the tax system. If an artist is in a 50% tax bracket basically he is creating one work for the government the next for himself.  Stephen King talked about this in the beginning of a collection of his short stories. Someone pointed out to him how he was virtually losing money because when he wrote short stories, but he said they were things he felt like doing so he did. The government doesn't tell the CEOs how much they are going to need and then let them decide how they are going to make that much. It taxes them, just as the artist by how much they make. Even these superfund taxes, when you look at them actually, are like that. The governement takes into account several things like income and potential environmental risks.  I never said anyone should pay my share of taxes. Explain to me how the cleanup of  a chemical used in a product that might not even be sold in my country/state/county is rightfully my share that I am trying to dodge. NOW EXPLAIN TO ME IS IT EASIER TO GIVE TAX BREAKS TO ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY COUNTRIES OR ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY INDIVIDUALS. <br>
<br>
I did not say I earned it I said the government earned it and I should have, as this nation was designed, as much say as anyone else who can votein how it is spent.  I don't want to offend you anyfurther by jumping to conclusions you seem loathe to invalidate, so do you believe, as I have heard some foolish people say, that the government does not provide services to you?  Oh wait you did say the government does not earn its money.  Do you truly believe  this? <br>
<br>
Apparently you didn't read my thing on the corporate welfare vs social welfare.  The numbers are how much each person pays in, on average for each service. It isn't how much each recipient averages. Makes the numbers look different huh?  You see I pointed out that the corporate welfare does not include tax breaks, even those like the Prince William Cleanup. In fact you quote that section and then say that corporate welfare IS in my examples, tax cuts. It is very simple if you can understand words in the order they are strong together. <br>
<br>
No, I don't have concern for Bush. I might have given a crap, about him once, but after the governors were calling moratoriums on the death penalty and investigations were placed on death sentences, he shut down the investigations, went out of his way to do so.  Grinned and said I believe they are all guilty that have been found so.  Even as day after day DNA testing was releasing people on death row.  The uppity negroes part was actuall a quote of his in regards to a black lead PAC group. That man should learn to know when cameras are rolling and tape machines are on. Even if reporters are&quot; a$$holes&quot;, or if he feels the need to brag to a foriegn dignitary that &quot;I can't believe I won. I was running against peace, prosperity and incumbency.&quot; he should remember we will quote him on it later.  What is the definition of &quot;is&quot; anyway.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Waaaa....&quot; I perhaps took out of context. Perhaps that was meant to be us liberal's mating call? Or was that an alliterative whine?  <br>
<br>
The devaluation part was addressed to andmun. I was interested in hearing his theories on those theories, because he seemed to have a very real grasp on economics.<br>
<br>

The number of superfund sites is expected to rise under Bushes lenient watch and penalties. Some estimate say it could be as high as 25-30% short. So what does this mean?<br>
<br>
Either one of two things, sites don't get cleaned properly or at all or....yup raise in taxes or cut in other programs. Since we are in a state of national emergency we will most likely not scale back any military or bureaucratic waste, even if star wars doesn't work on paper even yet and is a violation of a few treaties &quot;we need it now more than ever&quot;. Even though it WOULD NOT have prevented any of the tragedy of S11. So either the cuts come from social reform programs or a tax raise, which will come through a democratic Senate. Come election time every conservative is going to be pointing those propsed tax hikes out while completely denying they were the result of it. I bet the Democrats are stupid enough to set themselves up for this. <br>

Tell me, if the number of people going to "teacher college" (whatever that is) is so mind-boggling, why do we have such a dearth of teachers?  What are we doing with all these spare teachers?  If we have so many teachers, yhy are school districts desperate for subs?  I live in one of the best 100 school districts in the United States -- why is there no one to fill the empty post of 3rd grade teacher at one of the local elementary schools?  Why is there no Middle School Librarian?  I'll tell you why -- because there are so few teachers!<br>
Now, as for teachers vs. lawyers, I have a first-hand view on that.  My mother is a teacher.  My father is a lawyer.  Both are directly responsible for hiring.  In a single year, my father turns away more hopefull associates than my mother has seen applicants in her entire career.  That's because there are oh-so-many teachers and oh-so-few lawyers, you see.<br>

While it is true their are many people who enroll in elementary education and other related fields it is probably also one of the greatest where they do not persue careers in their chosen field. Why? Because we don't pay them enough. Being a secretary for some business is a lot less stressful and usually a lot better pay. <br>

I was struck by the similarities between Jack Welch and my grandfather, Walter Hoving, chairman of Tiffany &amp; Co. for 25 years. I was also struck by the differences. I wondered what Walter Hoving would have done if he had been told his company was responsible for creating 81 toxic Superfund sites across the U.S. through PCB contamination.<br>
<br>
Would he have launched a public-relations campaign downplaying the toxicity of fish tainted with PCBs, a compound banned worldwide? Would he have spent large amounts of shareholder money on a lobbying campaign to amend the federal Superfund law to limit industry liability for the costs of toxic cleanups?<br>
<br>
I think not. My grandfather's sense of responsibility to the country he loved included a moral conviction to do what is right. Welch epitomizes the stereotypical corporate leader whose sense of responsibility is driven by the short-term bottom line. The things that inspire many of today's business leaders to greatness are a sad departure from what made business leaders great in my grandfather's time.<br>

Hmm... guess superfund isn't just about screwing the rich. It seems a wealthy person here is supporting it. 81 superfund sites! Some estimates say Welch is responsible for 62 some say 85 any which way that is a lot of cleanup. Perhaps that amount of environmental destruction is the price to pay, for under Welch's watch GE rose form a worth of 12 billion to a worth of 280 billion. Think of all those jobs that money probably created, right Cenelron? But, wait......there's more....Yes during his reign Jack Welch magaged to cut GE's American workforce by 50%. During the Clinton administration Welch was one of the primary critics of Superfund laws. Who can blame him? If forced to pay for their clean ups GE might not have been able to pay his $94000000 a year salary or any of his benefits. (Wonder if those included all you can eat Hudson river fish?) He filed so many fraudulent lawsuits against the government for enforcing rules against him that GE lost its contracts with the U.S. government. Yay Lobbyist. <br>

This matters because a) she doesn't have to go through a public school board to hire a teacher, and b) that even when teachers are not paid by taxpayers there is still no surplus of them.  <br>
<br>
It also bears noting that while there may in fact be more people going to college to become teachers than lawyers, our society needs many more teachers than lawyers.  Consider just how many schools exist in this country and how many teachers it takes to operate even a small school, versus the number of law firms and the number of lawyers it takes to operate one. <p>Arikel, n00b thane of The Grey Legion <BR>

<br>
Fire fighters in this country make 2/3 of what a teacher makes IF that, maybe 1/2 in some cases.When I watch the news, I see teacher strikes every few weeks or so.It happened here 2 years ago.<br>
<br>
IMO,Teachers make okay money, enough to get by,but they also complain about not being paid enough.Fire fighting is a more rigorous job,get paid less,yet, most do not complain.Why you may ask?Because the men and women love their jobs and what they do.If you truly love your job, ANY money you make should be a bonus (After the amount you have to get by in life).<br>

<br>
We need more Democrats in office, they are faultless.<br>
<br>
<br>
In other news, teachers in the northeast who have 15 children are considered in poverty and qualify for welfare....proof positive that teachers are underpaid.<br>
<br>
In most places there are generally only shortages of teachers in specific (science and math) areas.  That's because it takes a person with half a brain to teach those subjects and teachers with half a brain are rather scarce.<br>
<br>
My father was a teacher, my sister is a teacher, my wife was a speech pathologist in the school systems.  MOST teachers do not complain about the pay because they work, on average, every other day and get full benefits and their schedules coincide with the schedules of their children.  That's one of the main reasons people take the job.  The biggest problem teachers have are liberals who screw up the system with indoctrination programs and who tie their hands from teaching those that will learn by burdening them with those that refuse to learn.<br>
<br>
Oh, and I'm a lawyer...yes we should get rid of half of them (but not the half that I'm in <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ) because the majority of them are liberals and I don't like sharing the business.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
And the reason we have so many lawyers and lawsuits is there are too many people looking for a free ride (like some people posting to this thread) and always wanna sue to get some money or sue to keep those damn Republicans from using their land as they see fit.<br>
<br>
The Superfund is a tremendous waste of other people's money.  Ritt...why don't you say something about their definition of &quot;clean?&quot;  Do you think it is reasonable to spend 2 billion dollars on any site that doesn't have dirt &quot;clean&quot; enough to eat a cubic foot of it every day for 30 years with no harmfull effect?<br>

You say that they qualify for food stamps and that is 'nuff said...but it is not.  Tell the whole story.  Are you talking about a substitute teacher (who only needs a high school diploma) who works two days out of the week?  Are you talking about a teacher with 15 kids?  <br>
<br>
If you wanna talk about baseless arguments...give all the facts.  Your made up hypotheticals have no more credibility than mine.  That is the point.  Yet you are so quick to pat each other on the back when your made up stories point out something you believe is true.<br>

Why is it pin heads who think they know everything love to call people less intelligent?  Is that your rebuttal, that I do not sound intelligent when I point out your charade?  Grow up.  <br>

<br>
Where did she post the number of children they had?  Or what their wages were?  Does Northampton give food stamps to families of 4 who earn less than $25,000 per year?<br>
<br>
You can give food stamps to millionaires and it does not mean that they are underpaid.<br>
<br>
&quot;3. I do think some professions are underpaid, yes. &quot;Teacher&quot; comes immediately to mind. These men and women spend day in and day out trying to expand the minds and opportunities of children for so little pay that many of them are on food stamps. (Especially those in the public school system.) Yet they continue to do it. I think they deserve more money -- if teaching paid more, we wouldn't have the dearth of teachers we do now. Overworked and underpaid, but I guess there must be some reason they do it....&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Heh, I must have missed a post because I sure can't find where it was clear that this was talking bout full time teachers with 0-3 children, I guess I did need the clarification. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

As for sounding less intelligent, how about:<br>
<br>
&quot;The poor do not choose to be poor. I am poor.&quot;<br>
<br>
Here she leads us to believe she is going to give us her story about how she is poor and it has nothing to do with her choices...<br>
<br>
&quot;My total salary for the past tax year was under $4000.&quot; <br>
<br>
Well, so much for that idea, you are not working full time and earning $4,000 per year.  Therefore she is chosing to work less and remain poor.<br>
<br>
&quot;Although I am not on welfare, many of the working poor need the help.&quot;<br>
<br>
Ok, what does your situation have to do with anything then?  I like cheese, and although many people don't like cheese, we should all send $10 to the World Wildlife Federation because their $3 billion in assets must grow so long as there are still some people out there who think that they should be able to cut down trees......   /boggle<br>
