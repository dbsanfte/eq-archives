Do they sell that @#%$ in WV?  I want some.<br>
<br>
As a former U.S. Marine, I say you are full of @#%$ on just about every military thing you mentioned.  The military NEVER EVER teaches you to bail.  You fight till you run out of ammo, then you pull your knife, and fight till its gone, then choke your enemies until you cant fight any more.  If you spewed your @#%$ in a hotzone with my old crew, you wouldn't have to worry about the enemy.  They'd shoot you themselves before having you to catch their backs.<br>
<br>
Majored in English?  You cant even write in it.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> 1. druids never get lost. they have track <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> You are just about the biggest fvcking idiot I've ever seen on these boards... and that's an accomplishment worth getting a plaque for.  Before running your dork-buffer, why dont you look up what track does.<br>
<br>
I use Root (yep regular root spell) to crowd control in the planes (I'm a necro with less than half your hps).  I use regular old root to solo mobs that you apparently would @#%$ your pants and run to desktop if you saw.<br>
<br>
Your guild is your family.  You NEVER abandon family.  As far as save your own ass, I will intentionally chain cast my biggest nukes and sit at the feet of a mob (GUARANTEED to pull argo off of anything) with all 950 of my HPs to get the mob off of our cleric (or our chanter) so the group may live  or at least let a cleric get out to rezz everyone.<br>
<br>
Get in Magister?  You have got to be kidding me.  If you would have kept your mouth shut, you would have come out of his thread ok.  After opening it, I can promise you will never be in my guild and sure many others feel the same.<br>
<br>
The military, family, sickness thing has NOTHING to do with your skills (or lack thereof) and the way you play this game.<br>
<br>
The BEST thing you can do for yourself is listen to the VERY GOOD shamans here who are giving you advice that you dont deserve.  Go to that board someone posted and learn about your class.  Better yet, make a druid.  Every other idiot does.. and at least you'd never have to worry about getting lost. <p><a href="http://members.aol.com/wvvetteman/images/dalonhorse1.jpg" target="_blank">

I will post it again as somehow you seemed to have missed it.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> &quot;As a matter of fact I was looking for Shantara so that I could pull the mobs off her so that she could evac us if needed.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
That was posted by a member of your group and guild member. He said himself that he was LOOKING for her so that he could help her out. Now, perhaps she was in the room, but was hard to see, in which case the points are the same.<br>
1) Kilmal felt that the druid was not there nor able to help the group, whether that means she was not in the room, or was in a corner getting beat on. I am not here to place blame, I was simply bringing up points that your own guildie mentioned.<br>
2) Also, whether or not the druid was getting beat on or not with group, she could not evac reguardless.<br>
<br>
If I am wrong, then so be it, but that was what a member in your group said. Take it or leave it. <p><h4><font color="#00ffff">_______________________</font></h4><h4><font color="blue">- If ignorance is bliss, why aren't more people happy?</font></h4>

Shanny just called me cuz I was slackin and not online gettin my 60 ;)<br>
<br>
Ok..a few things to clear up...  I was the 59 pally (god help us).  We did fine up to the camp itself.  Dark hit the trap and was feelin the heat.  I went to the side to try and throw him heals, but he was already dead.  I then told the group to chill there at camp and I'll drag his corpse out.  I also had not done the Efreeti camp before, so I was clueless, but I get points for trying ;)<br>
<br>
I had levi and walked around the pit to see if I could locate his corpse by sight...no luck.  I then realized I was slowly descending into the nice pretty orange colors ;)  Probably should have been lookin for the edge before I moved beyond it..heh<br>
<br>
I floated above the lava for a bit locating Dark's corpse.  When I got it, they got aggro.  I was NOT there when it happened, unfortunately.  I then frantically searched for a way out of the lava, and couldn't find one.  I tried to get to the edge nearest them to throw some support heals...Out of range (typical).  I watched everyone's health start to deteriorate and felt pretty much helpless as I dragged around a fatass white bear corpse *snicker*.<br>
<br>
Shantara WAS there as far as I was concerned...I heard the spam heal chats, and could see through the wall a little bit if I turned a certain angle.  But maybe you chickened out too fast to see the rest of the group trying to actually pull it together.<br>
<br>
Almost everyone was dead, and I got some aggro, and began to solo I believe an imp (if my memory serves correctly...which normally it doesn't).  Everyone was dead by the time I got the imp to a point of running.  I got a bright idea (not that it happens all the time mind you) that I'd follow the fleeing imp wherever he went to find a way outta here.  Lo and behold, @#%$, there's a way outta the lava ;)<br>
<br>
Everyone is dead, I finish off the mob in the lava, and manage to go back and drag Dark's corpse to a ledge near some bats in a hallway.  I rezzed him up, and we both proceeded to clear the way back duo so I could rez the rest.  You had logged by this time, which is still a question to me..why you did log.<br>
<br>
Now then...  First things first...  I've caused many a wipeout before...but I've never once abandoned anyone for any reason.  That's just pathetic and unforgiveable.<br>
<br>
Second..don't ever compare yourself to Dark, because you could never play at the level he plays at.  I would have died for sure clearing the way to Efreeti again for CR if you were with me instead of Dark.  Dark knows how to play his shaman.  I can understand that you may have low brain power, and can't ponder how someone can play like he can...so you have to knock his skills and search for something to point out..e.g....him "suiciding" (lol) into the lava.  You will NEVER be able to play a shaman as well as Dark can...don't ever put yourself on his level.<br>
<br>
Third...you are a disgrace to the US Military Forces, your stepdad or father whichever, and me.  I was in the Army, and you NEVER leave your man behind.  What you brought up was a bunch of horse-@#%$ that you got off a TV screen somewhere.  I am glad I never knew you in the military, or we would have given you a beating.  You were probably the guy that always got our platoon busted and never knew the meaning of teamwork.<br>
<br>
Fourth...I was once a hardhead, and didn't listen to my superiors (if that's the word I'm thinkin of..)  When I finally started losing respected friends over it, I stopped, and I listened.  I have gained more in life to this day for thinking this way.  It's time to move from childish ways and think of those around you.<br>
<br>
Fifth...you obviously will not give a damn about this, because you "only care for yourself"...because when you were a G.I. Joe, they taught you to only kill people and take no prisoners.  What country you take your training in btw?  Take it for whatever it's worth.<br>
<br>
Sixth...adding to this...I'm sure you are happy now without a guild, due to you being all for yourself.  If you get into a guild that has heard of this incident, and doesn't care...more power to em.  But I'm sure you wouldn't care as you are all about yourself and would probably rather go solo, yes?<br>
<br>
I am glad you will find whatever it is you're looking for.  I'm doubly happy that Legion of Ka will be now without a deserter such as yourself.<br>
<br>
P.S.  Sorry for all the .... ..... .........  I'm bad about that *snicker* <p>Sigoniax Eve<br>

I guess there are a lot of crappy dinette sets out there in the world from you making them when you were 9 years old?  And could the 11 year old restaurant manager explain the slow lines at McDonald's?  You have to give a nod to someone so stupid they admit their own lies within two pages of posts.<br>

Hiya folks,<br>
<br>
Wouldn't you know it? I step away from the forum for a couple of days and the bloody thing explodes. Over a hundred postings on this thread in two days, not bad. Not bad at all.<br>
<br>
I was content to just read it until I happened to see my guild mentioned. Kilmal stated on page one of this thread:<br>
<br>
"i have gotten guild invites but they didnt match the requirements. from of coures bludysky's guild, ICoN among others. "<br>
<br>
As Guild Leader of ICoN (Inner Circle of Norrath) I must set the record straight. Kilmal has not received a guild invite from us. From what I have read, he never will receive a guild invite from us. In fact, ICoN and Legion of Ka have had a close guild alliance for a very long time. Part of our alliance is a firm agreement that neither guild will allow crossovers, thus, protecting the integrity of each guild - so it would have been impossible for ICoN to offer membership to Kilmal. Back when both of our guilds were small guilds, we helped each other in groupings and raids. Now that ICoN has grown into a decent upper middle level guild, we still are close allies and friends with Legion of Ka. They are good people who I call friends. Shantara and Darkforest can be trusted to lay out the truth and stick with their friends through thick and thin.<br>
<br>
/steps on soapbox<br>
<br>
I also have followed the postings about what a shammy should or should not do. I'm a 54 shammy who doesn't level very fast since guild cares and real life kinda slows the experience growth, but I feel I've learned a few things along the way. The main thing I've learned is that there are some very good shammy players out there from whom I can still learn a thing or two. Gloriana is nearly a shammy legend on Emarr, she's been around long enough and played enough to know the shammy and how it should be played. Kilmal, if you are reading this, you would do well to listen to her advice, stop arguing, and benefit by what she has learned over the years of playing a shammy. From my own point of view, I see a shammy as adaptive to fill a variety of roles in a group or raid, depending on what is needed. I dot, I dd, I slow, I heal, I crowd control, I melee, I gain aggro, I buff, I pet, I pull, and I die - a LOT. If a caster, especially a cleric or chanter, is getting beat on by a mob and the tanks can't help, I stand between the caster and mob and gain aggro because I can survive a heckula lot longer getting beat on than the typical caster. I am constantly watching my group and will toss a heal on a member if it looks like they are nearing that last bub of health. I use my epic spear's dot to start some mobs cooking while I root them when we have multiple pulls. I don't do anything special that hasn't already been mentioned, I play my shammy as a jack of all trades, balancing wisdom with AC and with resists. I don't care if my wisdom never goes beyond 150 because I also want AC so I can take hits - any good shammy worth their salt will do the same. We have so many different roles and the roles change depending on groups, raids, and situations - that's why I LOVE playing my shammy.<br>
<br>
/steps off soapbox<br>
<br>
Kilmal, simply admit that your "save number 1" attitude is wrong, apologize for abandoning your guildmates in a tight spot, learn from the situation, and move on. There is no shame in recognizing you made a mistake - we all make mistakes. The shame is when we try to cover up our mistakes or make light of them or ignore them entirely. You were wrong to log off as you did. The sooner you understand that and stop trying to split hairs, the faster you will be able to rebuild your reputation.<br>
<br>
Shantara and Darkforest, I am sorry you two and your guild are going through this very public affair. I applaud you for choosing to take the heat and have Kragarn post this warning thread. There are sharks who troll this forum looking to score a few hits here and there, but I understand what you were trying to do with this thread - warn other guilds of the negative experience you had with a former member. I will group with you two and any of the Legion of Ka people anytime, anywhere. You're good people and I like to be around good people.<br>
<br>
God bless,<br>
