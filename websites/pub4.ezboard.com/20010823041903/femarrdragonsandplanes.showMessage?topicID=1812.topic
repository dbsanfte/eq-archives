<br>
Does every fucking loser in the game hang out there?  I rarely go there, only for requested guild functions at this point because I'm just not real fond of the zone, and never have been.  But the last two or three trips I've made there, it's just amazed me the level of shitheads populating it.<br>
<br>
Let me just say this now for all of you that are in that zone (and I'm generalizing here, there are a few decent players I imagine, altho I don't usually have the luck of running into them).<br>
<br>
If you can't handle your damn pull, just because I'm sitting next to you doesn't mean I trained you.  Just because I walked thru the area you claim to be camping doesn't mean I'm going to KS you, or that I even want your camp.  I might be on the way to somewhere else.<br>
<br>
You pissant little whiners don't impress me, don't scare me, and frankly, don't matter to me. I don't want you to tell me, I don't want to hear you bitching to the zone, because your opinion means jack squat.  You are just talking to hear yourself talk, and the whole zone knows it.  <br>
<br>
If you feel the need to come watch me kill a mob, and it kills you instead, don't bitch to me.  I didn't ask for an audience, and quite frankly, I laughed my ass off when you died anyway.  You got what you deserved.<br>
<br>
Your threats are pitiful.  Nothing you do is gonna matter much to me.  Most people know me well enough to know what I will and won't do, and quite frankly, I'd find it damn fucking amusing if you came here to the boards spouting your pathetic little lies. <br>
<br>
Furthermore, you give your entire guild a bad name when you act like a rusty tool.  Unlike you, I'm not gonna threaten to go to your guild leader, because I figure they know what a low life you are, and besides, like I said before, your threats are about as important to me as the shit I scrape off of my shoe.  A minor annoyance, nothing more. <br>
<br>
My suggestion to you is to grow up and quit annoying the rest of us. You know who you are. <p>Caoilfhionn aka Carrot<BR>

  It's very simple...<br>
<br>
  You can do level 1-50 now without ever leaving a small set of approximately 5 outdoor zones, all of which center around Karnor's.  Every piece of gear you may need to reach 50 (although it is hard to define &quot;need&quot; nowadays when twinks are spawned with RBGs and weapons that shame... that is *shame*... what I had at level 50) can be bought with plat in EC with the abundant cash that drops off Kunark mobs.  Did you know that at level 20 you can solo and kill mobs in LoIO that drop multiple plat?  I rarely saw plat mobs at level 30 in the old world...<br>
<br>
  Kunark provides *unlimited* outdoor exp and a collection of players which creates both insanely safe soloing and grouping experiences.  Not to even mention that grouping with the Absurdly Twinked(tm) for short periods of time can skyrocket one's pleveling adventures.<br>
<br>
  You've got endless outdoor exp on one hand coupled with the Absurdly Twinked and/or the straight up absurdly powerful equipment currently available.  Both of these spell &quot;disaster&quot; when such players enter their FIRST dungeon of ALL TIME, *ever*... which is invariably Karnor's Castle due to location, where sow and jboots keep the illusion of safety and the vicious undead, jump anything that moves, aggro mobs mow down the unwary with reckless abandon.<br>

<br>
I've spent some time in one of them, LOIO, with my rogue twink (very mildly twinked compared to most) and while the exp flowed, it was boring me to tears. I've played in the Dreadlands with my warrior a couple times and almost nodded off once, while pulling.<br>
<br>
I headed to CT with my rogue at 26 and have had a blast there. This, just like KC, is a dungeon where you can SoW. It seems mostly populated by new players on their first character and twinks of people who used to play there with their main in 'the old days'. The average skill level of the people I've met there has been a good deal higher than what I saw in KC (which I shun like the plague). Quite a relief after a few levels in a zone where I had to filter out shout and ooc in order to stay sane <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .<br>
<br>
I guess I have to add a small rant too. This is for some of the people playing in KC. Just what do you expect to happen when 3 or 4 groups pull through the same friggin paths? If you insist on doing it just because you don't have the cojones to leave the zone area, you should not bitch when chaos erupts and you know what hits the fan.<br>

I personally dont like generalizations... case in point is the out door leveling and better equip...<br>
<br>
better equip = easier fights... dont see how that can ruin an experience unless you want it tough.<br>
<br>
out-door groups are only bad because people dont learn to pull the pathing zones, and agro is only when you run it by another creature.<br>
<br>
I think what the problem is is zone overpopulation.  WHen you get a dungeon that full of people trying to learn their parts better in a group you will have chaos.  Like someone mentioned... you have 4-6 groups pulling on the same damn path!!<br>

<br>
My best suggestion is to go in farther.. at least up to the ramparts maybe even into the hand room/jail area.. the XP up there is AWESOME and there are some great drops and most of the gimps stay near the zone so they can bail when they can't handle the 14 mobs they pulled.  Up there is hard without a good chanter and cleric though (although me, troll warrior atthe time, ronco 56ish barbie warrior, and mismatch 54ish shammy, were able to handle it thanks to ronco's superb pulling and mis's awesome skills <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ) <br>

Karnors is good for about 48 - 54 and then it's time to go to Old Sebiliss.  This has been my largest complaint about the high level game, simple overcrowding.  When I zone into Karnors and see 60 other people in the zone, I know I won't be getting a group there.  We need options.  Yes there are other high level zones, but you MUST bring your own group which usually means you must commit some time to it.  You don't put together a Hole exp group if you can only stay for an hour or two.<br>
<br>
And yes, I agree totally about leveling in outdoor zones exclusively.  You really don't need to learn the finer points of the game.  I remember one time pulling for a Dreadlands group.  We had a Chanter, we had a Cleric and we had some big damage dealers.  I would go out of my way to pull 2 or 3 mobs so the chanter could mez them and we could kill them at will.  This happened a few times and the Chanter wouldn't mez and then ASKED me to only pull singles...  Now THERE is an Enchanter I want at my back when I'm in the Hand / Warlord area of Karnors.<br>
<br>
Personally I did a nice mix of outdoor and dungeon zones.  I leveled like a madman in the Lake of Ill Omen and the Dreadlands, however I also a good share of my levels in Unrest, Cazic Thule, Sol B, Guk, and Karnors.<br>
<br>
Now, I just despise pickup groups at the high end game in general.  Give me a group with a core of guildmates, and I'm there for the long haul.  Put me in a pickup group and I'm praying that things go well and I survive. <p>Islington Angelwatch <br>

<br>
My regular group since level 30 has been: monk, monk, bard, shaman, enchie, cleric<br>
<br>
How the heck do you get that group OUT of HS and the Hole?  <br>
<br>
Why I think Sebilis works:<br>
* Keys aren't that hard to get<br>
* Safe place to zone in and look for a group<br>
* Not that difficult to get out of<br>
* Lots of different directions to go, you don't often have to run over another group to get where you're going<br>
* Great loot<br>
* Near an evac point<br>
<br>
Why I think Chardok doesn't work:<br>
* Way out in the middle of nowhere<br>
* Small loot pool (I like the randomness, though)<br>
* Very buggy, ghosting mobs, weird aggro transfers<br>
<br>
I have felt the same way...as someone who always enjoyed dungeon fighting, I feel really limited by the options at 55+.  Chardok is getting boring, HS is out because we don't always have a porter, Sebilis is overcamped and I can only go there if I turn off occ/shout/auction, I hate Velk's Lab because the slippery floors freak me out.<br>
<br>
The game is only going to become increasingly top heavy, I hope they are working to address the overcrowding issues, they are just going to get worse.<br>

I don't go to KC for leveling.  I'd rather never level again.<br>
<br>
I go to HS when I can, or BW if I have to, or I do something else entirely and don't worry about xp at all.<br>
<br>
KC just annoys me cuz it's a packed zone of people that can't take responsibility for their own game. Every problem is obviously someone else's fault.  You get accused of stuff before you are barely done zoning.<br>

Its also funny how alot of people so uber and laugh at all the &quot;gimps&quot; in karnor, when they themselves lived there everyday for 5 or 6 lvls. I havent been to Sebilis in a couple months.....its not exactly idiot proof anymore either.<br>

I generally join a moat group and then bitch and whine at them until they agree to move to hand or ramparts or basement or anywhere else away from the entrance and I don't recall having ever been trained with anything we can't handle, having ever been accused of KSing or campstealing or anything else.<br>

I just like OS because I have never been trained there before... well.. once by an idiot that thought it would be funny to see if something was camped while having about 4 mobs on him <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Someone already mentioned it, but HS is probably the best experience zone created. Skeleton mobs have always dumped the best exp. These aren't high blue to you at your upper 50s, but they sure as hell die fast. Faster than the other exp dungeon with the frogs. Those frogs have insane hp as opposed to our undead friends. However, they both drop nice loot. Why aren't people in this zone? Haha. Thank god they made this place. I am glad to know that the punks that infest KC will never have the balls to attempt HS. Why? Well, they may get in, but I'll be seeing their corpses just down below when they say, &quot;Wow, I've heard about the great loot in the South Wing!&quot; Go for it. It's just across the steps and you've got a rogue to open that locked door, so what's keeping you back?! This zone actually took a small hint of strategy and work to get the loot in, not like OS. <br>
<br>
<br>
P.S. Yes, this is a lure for you folks looking for the loot and exp in ridiculous proportions. I invite you to lose your corpse at the teleporter and zone in.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uaadon.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aadon</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 353<br> <font color=#E9D756>(4/19/01 12:18:03 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Why in the hell.....</span><hr size=1> Cao-<br>
