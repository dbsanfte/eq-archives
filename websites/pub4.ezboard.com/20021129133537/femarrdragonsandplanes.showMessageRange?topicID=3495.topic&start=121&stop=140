Thank you for your level headed reply. I appreciate you taking the time to answer my questions. I wish AD luck in the future. I'm very saddened by the past few days an the friendships I've lost over this. However, their are always pots of gold at the end of the rainbow as you said.<br>

I wouldnt trade my friends for Verant itself if it was offered to me... let alone give up a single one of my friends for an item obtained in game no matter how damn uber it is. <br>

<br>
What good is a pot of gold if you have no one to share it with?<br>
<br>
Sorry not trying to pick your post apart because I have nothing against you... I just really really really find it disturbing that people put their @#%$ loot over their @#%$ friends.<br>

It's probably wrong to believe there can be any limit to the horror which the human mind can experience.  On the contrary, it seems that some exponential effect begins to obtain as deeper and deeper darkness falls- as little as one may like to admit it, human experience tends, in a good many ways, to support the idea that when the nightmare grows black enough, horror spawns horror, one coincidental evil begets other, often more deliberate evils, until finally blackness seems to cover everything.

Thanks PC and GL</span><hr size=1> Hey Birren, go ahead and add Jarrett too, Dal forgot him as well.<br>
<br>
As far as commenting on this, I can tell you one thing. I had posted earlier that I felt anything is actually campable if you have the force there to kill it where it spawns. If you don't believe me, look up my earlier comments on these RF threads.<br>
<br>
Now with that being said, what exactly are you flaming PC about? Because we sat near its spawn point? Because we had clerics scouting there since the server camp up and you felt you had more of a right to it? It was your assumtion that PC was gonna try to KS it or get into some pissing match on first aggro? (my arrow landed before your spell) What a load of crap. You got yourselves all worked up over nothing.<br>
<br>
I helped with that camp for about 2-3 hours in the morning. There was about 8-9 PC there and around 28 AD there. A couple of AD were cool and sent me a tell as to what our intentions were but many of the rest of them was sending a barrage of trash in ooc. During that time, our leadership was asking us to not to respond becuase franky, its pretty pointless. I do not respect anyone who thinks its ok to verbally abuse people in ooc or in tells and I am very disapointed in how some AD members behave and how AD leaders really did not seem to be doing anything about it. As far as the events that happened later after more hours of that crap and the whole event desolved in calling a GM to resolve it. You dug your own grave.<br>
<br>
Wether you like it or not, it is ok for people to stand around if they are not interfering with what you are doing. If you fail to kill RF, you should expect somoene else to clean it up. It sure beats it despawning, because it will. Next time you feel like flaming someone, find a legitamate reason instead of your own assumtions.<br>
<br>
Btw, we have been discussing RF options ourselves so we don't always get into this kind of ugliness. One option that I like so far might be a guild rotation with have a pick-up slot and a KS slot for newer guilds to get into the rotation. Sure this might end up as bad as VS is but its better than what we have right now and will give some of the smaller guilds a shot at it.<br>
<br>
If you have any comments or questions, feel free to talk to me personally.<br>

They had the force to take Ragefire... why (regardless of attitude) was it appropriate to stay in the zone? <p>Baroness Syldra Marlowe<br>High Priest ~ Affliction<p><font size=1>

Thanks PC and GL</span><hr size=1>   All I want to know is why are you acting like RF is a camp . You say that , you had a capable force to take down RF . Did he spawn ? were you there ? Would the GL or Pc been there ? <br>
Could this have been handled better , yes . The point is they made RF a FFA . so dont get upset , cause you treated it as a camp . Respect ? you want to know respect , How about being nicer  for a change . You guys , acted like we did you wrong . We didnt ,we played by the current rule set of this server. We played it as a FFA , where you have one person wait it out and then call the rest to action when needed . And having a force capable enough to kill RF ? that means at the time of the spawn . This is how it would have gone down had you guys not been acting like babies , Pc and GL  prob wouldnt have rallied as such had you guys just let it go , but no you guys started bad mouthing us , calling us names . what did that do It rallied the troops for us . There Prob would have been half the amount of GL and PC . And saying that you guys had 45 and we each had about 25 , think of this ,we could have had twice that amount easily . Did Rf spawn no, you guys are saying that you would have maintained that camp with a capable force to take RF all this time ? I dont think so .  Would you all be prepared to .that I do believe . that is why its a FFA so that the first guild that is prepared to take him out will. If you guys could have taken him at the unknown spawning . then why be upset ? Because we showed up ?  you guys got upset , and started to bad mouth us , we give everyone respect until someone shows a lack of it . which you did . RF IS A FFA . dont treat it like a camp , thats your fault , not ours ! If you dont like it , complain to the ones who made it like that , WE respected the fact that it is a ffa if someone gets to RF and kills it before we do , then we go about our business and try again . you guys say that your cleric was there for 5 or 6 days ( camping RF ) , I believe you . But think about this if RF was  camp dont you think there would have been more people sitting in that zone claiming camp ! Only reason why you guys had a cleric there was cause everyone else treats it as a FFA . THATS A FACT !! you think PC or GL couldnt have camped it to hell PC could do a rotation easily and just called it a camp forever and you guys would have never had a chance to camp RF . Respect ? no one except AD here had flamed , PC and GL have had there prob and it was over a FFA ! But we didnt flame it . And we did get the next FFA spawn for our druid epic .  Thing is we treat each other with respect . We dont name call and we dont flame either . some peeps flaming here that were once GL  are no longer GL for reason . I have been a greylord since I started this game , I love this game and playing with the people in it , GL are never disrespectfull , but we do play by the rules set in this game . You guys could have handled it a lot different , than to get pissy , remember RF isnt a camp ! I dont blame you guys for not wanting to random , you guys didnt have to ,if you all had the ability to take him you would have .And think about this if we hadnt randomed then instead of us flaming , you guys would still be there not 6 days but 9!! and counting . with the possibility of getting KSED by someone else . You are acting as if Rf was going to spawn  that sec and we just pulled the rug out from under you , but that didnt happen . you guys actually believe that you have been ready to take Rf when he spawned i can tell you this we prob wouldnt have , but we would have rallied when it did happen . Just becuase of the way you all handled it we are more than ready to take him than ever . before we were doing it as  alst min thing which most FFA ARE Now its our mission to get our cleric ,our first and only clicker for the GL . Thanks AD . If it had been handled differently you guys would have prob still been there and both PC and GL would have been long gone .  All you guys would have had to put up with was some ooc chat and such nothing else . Respect ? we'll I tell you this, next time I see someone of your guild I will treat them with nothing but ,I doubt I will get the same in return . But thats ok , Ill live with it .If I get spamed on the game cause of this post then Ill know , How much you guys really respect others .           <br>

Thanks PC and GL</span><hr size=1> A few days ago, AD did the exact same thing to me in Kedge Keep. I was there for 8 hours straight, and they showed no respect or even a concern on why I was there. Oocing vulgarities, and acting really childish. I was told later on that one of their officers was in zone too.I will not go further into this matter on these boards; out of respect to AD's leader Bloodwulfie(sp?), who I spoke to, about this.<br>
<br>
There has been alot of talk about class on these boards about PC and GL. Well, if you read their responces they aren't slamming anybody, name calling, etc. They have no need to bring it to these boards, only person that needs to be involved is the said cleric. In my eyes at least, that shows they have some class.<br>
<br>
Only people you all should be getting mad is VI for making RF a horrid camp. You might not like it, but RF is a FFA. You should know this, and also know what comes with FFA. FFA doesn't hold true to a &quot;Time spent waiting for mob to spawn&quot; system. Yes, it does suck to be waiting for a x amount of days or hours..but that is the RISK you take on so-called &quot;Camping&quot; a FFA mob. No matter what you write/say...that clear fact will remain untill VI changes this spawn.<br>

Thanks PC and GL</span><hr size=1> I've never posted here before, andI have three questions:<br>
<br>
Q. Why is it that every Greylords member to post on this board is an incoherent jackass?<br>
<br>
Q. Why is it that every time I read something about a Ragefire kill steal or leapfrog it has something to do with PC?<br>
<br>
Q. Why is it that AD tries to insist that it's a guild that's courteous to guilds and players above and below their niche of power when they do things like demand Trak drops on pickup epic help kills? How about leapfrog other guilds in KK?<br>
<br>
I'll answer myself to the best of my ability:<br>
<br>
A. Because the GreyLords is a guild full of incoherent jackasses. <br>
<br>
A. Because PC continually tries to KS and leapfrog Ragefire.<br>
<br>
A. Because they do not respect invites who help kill triggered Traks. You know, unguilded people below their station of power.<br>
<br>
Personally, I think all three of these guilds have poor leadership, jackass members, and deserve exactly what they get. Zero respect (Hi, GreyLords), complete distrust (Hello, Pheonix), and general apathy due to hypocrisy (Good morning, Ater Draconis).<br>
<br>
Here's my advice to all three guilds, though I'm sure it won't be appriciated or heeded.<br>
<br>
Dear GreyLords: it's difficult to take a person seriously when they're barking threats, calling for reason, or just having a nice general one-on-one conversation when that person types like a retarted three year old.<br>
<br>
Pheonix: Grow the hell up. VI made the rules to cover their ass, not yours. Hopefully you'd have a bit more respect for yourselves, if not another guild.<br>
<br>
Ater Draconis: Let this sink into the depths of your mind. You are a guild full of mid-to-high level people that couldn't get into a good guild. You are no less annoying, nor more respectful, than the GreyLords or PC. I will say, however, that you probably picked the absolute best representative to bring this out (in Razzer). He honestly seems to have no clue how much you suck.<br>

Ponicil, are you one of the ones we refused membership to? I dont know you from adam, and I dont know what you are referring to about Trak. Its apparent you have an issue with the guild. Feel free to contact me or any other AD officer IG or on our boards, and we will certainly address your concerns.<br>

And blackmoon, OBVIOUSLY someone really hurt your feelings in OOC or tells, please get me the logs and I will personally tear a strip a foot wide off anyone in my guild who was threatening or rude to you.  Mmmm kay?<br>

I mean damn! If you know a person has spent the last 120 hours waiting on something and you just waltz in and announce Lump it, then you deserve the respect you get. Whether its a lack there of or not, and if your guild condones it then there's nothing more to say.<br>

Better luck next time, and rest assured I'll never be one of those clerics you have to roll against after waiting that long. I treat others how I wish to be treated. Instead of going around doing whatever I want no matter the price.<br>

<br>
I'm really late on this whole thing, but as fate had i I had to go out of town on thursday evening to see a specialist about sumpin so I missed the very end of this. Reading through all this makes my head hurt, but I cant just leave it alone and walk away. So, here's what I have to say.<br>
<br>
-1-<br>
To my guildmated posting here.<br>
 Watch your language. Swearing doesnt make the statement hit any harder, it makes you sound like an immature highschool jerk. I know I'm not an officer in our guild, but I was sitting there with Blood and spludge when they decided AD would be formed, and I refuse to see people carrying their tag act like asses in the general public. Same as working as a sales rep. Do whatever you want in your own time, but when you're meeting with a client you suck it up and act with respect and dignity... even if you hate dealing with them. <br>
<br>
-2-<br>
To the other two guilds in concern<br>
 Like it or not there is still something called common courtesy.<br>
 The analogies earlier worked well, and whoever kept comming back and saying "nope, that one doesnt work either" grow up. It doesnt have to be an exact scenario match, it just has to carry the same principals. <br>
 "What makes you deserve this more than me? I cant put 3200 straight hours into camping a spawn, i have a job and a life, and this shouldn't keep me away from the games most coveted prises." That is EXACTLY right. NO ONE deserves it more than you. If that's what you want then that's what you can get, even on limited play time. Why? because that's why you make friends, and that is why you join guilds, so that they can help you out with stuff, even if you are not online. You want the mob but cant put in the time to get it? Spread out the time it takes to a few different people. You dont have to sit there 24-7 to make something yours, but someone with the same tag or with your permission will get just as much (or should, anyways) respect for holding your spot while you cant be there. Make sense? Then why do you have to cut in like that and make an issue out of it when you could do just like everyone else who passed through the zone: "Oh, AD's got it covered. Ok, good luck guys and girls. We'll stand over here and if you cant get the job done we'll finish it up. " <br>
 Don't even try to say that you werent even trying to KS us and that you were all just standing around waiting. We were told in no uncertain terms when PC players first showed up that this was "an FFA mob and when he spawns he's fair game." You dont like someone being edgy and semi-hostile? Try a different conversation starter. Doing that and then pushing in towards the spawn point is like the old "not touching... cant get mad" game that annoys the hell out of your older/younger brother/sister. Eventually they just punch you. <br>
 <br>
 Next time can you please show some courtesy. This is not like some people waisted a day not getting a spawn, this is a whole week of alot of peoples time.<br>
 That being said... I dont care if you dont think you're in the wrong. Maybe after all you were in the right and I just can't see it from where I'm standing. BUT the fact of the matter is that weather it was done by the book or not your actions hurt other people, and you "should" feel some remorse for that. Enough to say "Hey, what happened back there sucked, and I wish that it all would just go away. Sorry for the hard feelings." Untill I get that then I have nothing to do with you, because I feel slighted by what happened and I want someone to acknowlege that it could have worked out different if just a couple of different words had been used.<br>
 <br>
 But as I said earlier, I'm showing up late and I'm on so many pain killers right now for my back that I dont know which way is up. If their's spelling mistakes sorry, if I rambled sorry. To people in either guilds that I considder friends (alila... hows it going sis? havent seen you in like forever!! you get your epic and decide to quit or what? I got my Phinny staff on 7th try, I know how you felt) give your guildies a swift kick in the tail just because. <br>
<br>
 Anyways, I'm logging on to go kill VS. <br>
<br>
See ya, Love ya, la ta.<br>

WithDraw</span><hr size=1> I would like to formally apologize to AD, GL, PC, everyone else, and Trech (since I did the quotey thingy to him =) ) and retract any and all statements made regarding this topic.<br>
<br>
reason: I believed AD was a small guild. I was wrong. AD is NOT a small guild and when I say small, I mean with few members. Darue pretty much grew up in small guilds (with the exception of Stone Guard waaaay back when, but thats a different story about a cleric who REALLY pissed me off). <br>
<br>
I came here to fight the fight for a small guild, picturing our cleric (WOOT! Props For Annz!!) and the members we had, getting steam-rolled by a MUCH larger guild. When I say small, I mean enough members in a guild to make a few groups..thats it.  As was the way of the Brotherhood. (allthough we did have some good fun! hehe =) )<br>
<br>
After doing a /w Ater all at 7am PST I have realized the folly of my ways (heh, do a /who &lt;the guilds i was in&gt; all at 7am PST and you might get lucky if you found 4 members on) and would like to apologize for even being in this thread as it has nothing to do with me.<br>
<br>
Ater D, you are a large guild..much larger than the guilds I have been a member of in the past, so this is not the fight I was looking for.<br>
<br>
once again, I would like to retract any and all statements I have made regarding this issue and apologize for any of my posts made to the peoples of GL, AD, and PC as well as the quotes of Trech. <br>
<br>
I was just trying to be a defense for the little people. That defense is not needed at this time. I hope you all can understand where I was coming from.<br>
<br>
Good luck to you ALL in your endeavors, and may RageFire bring more interesting reading to this board. hehe =)<br>

WTF</span><hr size=1> <br>
Guess someone doesnt know where Im coming from when I made that last post.<br>
<br>
I thought this was a case of a very large guild running over a very small guild. <br>
<br>
For thats why I voiced my opinion. <br>
<br>
This is not the case. Granted PC is quite large, but so is AD (large meaning larger than the guilds Darue has been proud to be a part of..much larger)<br>
<br>
I was just tryin to look out and stick up for the little guys. I thought AD was one of those very small guilds. I was wrong.<br>
All guilds involved are pretty big and as such can fight amongst themselves.<br>
<br>
If you knew me in game, you might understand. Always there to help with whatever as long as the help that was given was returned to someone less fortunate. I guess An example could be<br>
<br>
 ..see a TRUE naked newb (hard to find these days), help them get started, they say thanks and ask what they can do in return for the generosity that was showed to them. I am the type that would just ask they return the favor to someone else who was in their position. <br>
<br>
/shrug hope that made sense.<br>

How about leapfrog other guilds in KK?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->  Hrmm.. That was a lovely Trak run for the epic piece.  Do you know how it started?  Maybe you should ask the person who got the epic drop.  For the uninformed public (YOU), he contacted one of our officers and said he couldn't get his piece.  Would our guild be willing to help him for the spell drops on the way and whatever BP Trak dropped.  Our officer that was contacted sent word to the guild asking for assistance if we cared to.  We gathered from all over the server, fought down there and killed him (VERY quickly thanks to MBing wizzies who joined in).  Were you one of those wizzies?  Would the shaman BP that dropped fit you?  From my understanding, we didn't demand those drops, that is what was offered by the person wanting to kill trak for his epic.  This wasn't a normal pickup raid.<br>
<br>
As far as KK, was Yumten with you (if that wasn't you Yumten I apologize, but I believe it was)?  If so, you must have been with the group that watched them kill the seahorses and then rushed in when they had cleared to Phinny.  I can understand how you'd be upset with them cussing you for running to take Phinny after they cleared the path there.  You might be interested to know that as pissed as they were, one of our officers pulled them down, said they'd just block the path next time to prevent it from happening again and AD cleared out of zone. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/udalamarndarkgem.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dalamarn Darkgem</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 491<br> <font color=#E9D756>(7/27/02 12:21:24 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3495.topic&index=139>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> sorry to dual post</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> A.
