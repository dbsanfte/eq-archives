<br>
However <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Thanks for sharing the prayer.  <br>
<br>
I find the reaction of the senators somewhat amusing, and more than a little sad.  Amusing because the shock probably was printed on their faces!  <br>
<br>
Sad because a very intolerant individuals walked out.<br>
<br>
Someone on the first page mentioned Satanic Worship and animistic worship.  While I walk out during a prayer for either of those and log a complaint, had the prayer been any other religion - I simply would not have participated.<br>
<br>
Many on these boards speak of the arrogance and intolerance of Christains, yet don't see the same possiblity in those of a different/no faith.<br>
<br>
<br>
Anyways.<br>
<br>
One thing.  First page.  Of course, said by Lurikeen, like he needed to ask =p<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Even Jesus spoke against public prayers<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Actually, he didn't speak out against public prayer.  He advocated corporate prayer - in Acts it mentions several times how the apostles carried on praying, taking communion, teaching, and being in fellowship together as a vital part of a spirtual life.<br>
<br>
However, Jesus was very much against any type of <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> formalized</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> public prayer, i.e. mindlessly repeating the Lord's Prayer with no thought whatsoever in a church every single Sunday. (Please don't take offense everyone who does this, kk?  Keep in mind I said mindlessly repeating ok?).  Jesus gave us that prayer to teach us how to pray - whom to pray to (our father), who dwelled in a Holy place not of this sin-filled earth (who art in Heaven), Giving glory and praising Him (hallowed be thy name).... kk I am sure ya get the picture.<br>
<br>
Point is, public prayer is a necessity for spiritual growth and vitality in a community.  Note its <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> spiritual<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  community I am talking of here.<br>
<br>
Anyways, ya knew I just had to stick my finger in this discussion, didn't you?  Stir up the pot so to speak.<br>
<br>
<br>
Lastly, two questions Lurikeen.<br>
<br>
Why do you find it arrogant for someone of any relgion, but especially Christianity, to state their beliefs as truth?  I ask because: 1)  whenever there is a post regarding anything Christian, the first thing you point out is the arrogance of the faith.  2)  I don't believe that stating something I believe to be truth is arrogant.  I believe God exists, Jesus died for our sins, and the bible is truth.  However, whenever I have stated that - you called me arrogant.  I really want to know - how do you clssify that as arrogant.  Simply because I have investigated other religions or lack thereof, and placed my faith in one, does not mean that I am arrogant.  It means I think I know the truth.  I ask because it has to be more than simple disagreement on your part.  <br>
<br>
Second question:  why, if you are an atheist, do you answer so many religiously themed posts?  I am simply curious on this one.  Is it the stimulation fo the debates, or are you trying to explain another side, or?<br>
<br>
Well, signing off.<br>
<br>
As always, no spell check or anything.<br>
<br>
As always, it takes time to get back if a response is required.<br>
<br>
As always, don't freak or take offense.  if you take offense, I probably didn't write it very well.<br>
<br>
And as always, I do not respond to flaming or completely sarcastic responses designed to belittle what I said.  There is no point, play elsewhere.<br>
<br>

<br>
That would be public prayers amongst a christian community, Lukaria. I don't need to hear your prayers, since I am not interested in the Christian brand &trade; of spirituality. Also, many Christians who want to push their faith into politics avoid the bit where Jesus says "pray in <b>your room</b>". I wonder why that is? :) I should point out that I did in fact state Jesus was not speaking against all public prayers, only certain types of public prayers such as those spoken aloud by the politicians of his day, the Saducees.<br>
<br>
<i>"Many on these boards speak of the arrogance and intolerance of Christains, yet don't see the same possiblity in those of a different/no faith."</i><br>
<br>
Well, Buddhists don't poke around in politics and don't try to enforce chanting in schools or reading Buddhists texts therein. Muslims and Jews don't actively proselytize and are not involved in forcing their prayers in schools or in our public institutions. So, jeez, I wonder why Chrisitians get a bad rap? *grin* Last time I checked no other faiths had senators praying in public basically saying everyone is going to hell in a handbasket, insulting peers, and generally being an @#%$. I suppose if you were one of the religious minorities in this country you would have a different view point on the prayer the jerk Senator tried to force on all his peers (he is just one example of many like him), Lukaria.<br>
<br>
<i>"Why do you find it arrogant for someone of any relgion, but especially Christianity, to state their beliefs as truth?"</i><br>
<br>
Hmm... you are mistaken about what I think, so I am glad I can clear up this misconception on your part. I do not find it arrogant for someone to state their beliefs as truth. What I find arrogant is offering views as "the Truth" (with a capital T) when not asked. The best witness of a life filled with love and truth I have seen is from those who do as Christ instructed... "Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven."<br>
<br>
Jesus expects people to be able to observe the lives of believers to the point that they can make a sound decision to accept or reject the good news. What that means is no bible thumping. Those who think that preaching Christ crucified outside of making friends with people is anything less than arrogance have a lot to learn. It is rather presumptuous of some Christians to think that public prayers and preaching, to those who haven't asked to hear the word, will make the non-believer drink of the spirit of Christ. It is such presumptuosness that makes these same Christians look overbearing and self-important. In a word, arrogant.<br>
<br>
<i>"Second question: why, if you are an atheist, do you answer so many religiously themed posts?"</i><br>
<br>
In a country, such as the United States, where the majority claim to be "Christian" I think it necessary to offer an alternative voice if given opportunity. You will notice though, Lukaria, I don't tell Christians to abandon their faith, or to stop believing in god. Indeed, you haven't seen a single posting of mine here where I try to deconvert Christians. Again, I believe it is important for non-Christians to be open about their lack of belief in the Christian god.<br>
<br>
Finally, most Christians (such as yourself, apparently) find it hard to believe that non-Christians, or even atheists, can live fullfilling spiritual lives. Truth is, we don't need the Christian god(s) or Jesus Christ in order to be truly happy, caring, loving. If anything, I find it important to share what I can offer to other human beings. I feel I walk the same path as those who love others and love truth.<br>
<br>
I hope I have answered your questions.<br>
<br>

<br>
To be fair, these things happen for other religions, just not in the US, at least not in public schools. I know there's Jewish schools in Australia where I suspect jewish prayers are actively imposed apon students. Not that I have a problem with that, as when you enrol in a school run by a religious insitution, you know what you're in for. Several countries do not subscribe to separation of church and state, and have state sponsored religions or religiously run governments. There are countries of this nature for many different religions. While I don't agree with the integration of church and state, at least they are being honest about it (I'll still happily bitch about it however, just maybe not as loudly.).<br>
<br>
Taking it apon myself to answer some of the questions Lukaria posed to Lurikeen, I oppose religious intolerance and aggressive proselytizing by any faith, I just see it more often from Christians. That is because in the community in which I live there are more Christians than those of other faiths. In such a socielty, Christians more likely to have an expectation that others will share their faith, and treat those who do not either as an oddity to be marvelled at or someone who needs converting. This behaviour is quite condescending. By sheer numbers, I'm more likely to bump into those behaving in a manner I find offensive. I'm sure (in fact I know) that I can find the behaviour of non-Christians arrogant an distasteful in religious discussions. I also dislike atheists who show no respect for the beliefs of others. Lastly, I should state that by no means do I take offense to all Christians (or those of other or no faiths). You can rest assured that if you've taken the time to read this thread and take note of the opinions of other people, you're not going to be the recipient of any ill-will from me <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>----------------------------------<br>

<br>
People walked out as a protest of sorts.  If they had stayed, it may have been seen as supporting the senator, but by walking out they let others know how they feel.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Many on these boards speak of the arrogance and intolerance of Christains, yet don't see the same possiblity in those of a different/no faith.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I think the arrogance comes from the attitude that Christians believe they are right and all other religions are wrong.   When you try to back up that belief with political and social power, it turns into arrogance.  However, it is not just Christians this can happen to.  Muslim countries suffer from the same problem.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> why, if you are an atheist, do you answer so many religiously themed posts? <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Though meant for Lurikeen, I will jump in with an answer for this as well.<br>
<br>
I use to ignore religious discussions.  But then I look out and see the religious political and social landscape and it scares me at times what religion can do.  From the Crusades to the Holocaust, religions are the focus of a lot of wars.  From Galileo to the Inquisition, it shows that religions wish to control thought.  From the blue laws to the &quot;In God We Trust&quot; motto, religion will try to impose itself on me in my daily life.  So it is too dangerous to be quiet anymore.<br>

I see what your saying in regards to being intolerant, but somewhere out there in the vast and complex world of Heaven, hell, earth, mind and spirit lies the truth. Some will be right while many will be wrong… and that's why I say that it is more important to give people the freedom to pursue religion and speak it then it is to censor it.<br>

I don't think the point is one of censorship. The arrogance involved Rheaton is the presumption made by some Christians that other <i>need</i> to hear their brand of message. What makes these Christians so sure that certain people need their message? It is the cavalier attitude evangelical Christians have towards all others not like them that is wrong. That is the arrogance. It is the attitude that <i>my</i> "truth" is <b>the Truth</b>. Well, we all think we have truth, but if someone believes they have all the truth there is, bully for them!

<br>
Lurikeen : It just seems that you've had some very bad run in's with people who, from your attitude, pushed themselves and their beliefs upon you, yet were hypocritical in nature.<br>
<br>
I don't feel you should close your mind so much if you ever hear someone preaching.  They really might have something important to say.<br>
<br>
Jesus embodied truth and love (certainly imo) and even most other religions agree that what he taught was far beyond others in truth, honestly, and sacrificial love.  What he WAS and what he said cut down all barriers, be it social, economic, physical, racial, or spiritual.  <br>
<br>
However it seems from your responses that you have already made your mind up, we are wrong and arrogant because we think we know the truth, anyone who dares to speak of the Truth with a capital &quot;T&quot; is immediately an arrogant ass who is most likely a hypocrite, and surely - all christians should be lumped together.<br>
<br>
Who really has the close mind here, Lurikeen?  I listen to other faiths, I simply do not believe.  From your comments, I am led to believe you will not even extend that courtesy.<br>
<br>
To all : Speaking of truth, we've discussed this before, but tell me this - almost all faiths allow for tolerance of individuals that are not of that faith, including Christianity.  Jesus spoke of how he came for Gentiles and jews, though many found that hard to swallow at that time (wanting to believe he was only the saviour of the Jews), including his own disciples.  However, almost all religions also believe that they know the Truth (notice the capital T).  Muslim, Jewish, Christian (these I know for sure) - profess that this is the way to true spirituality.  <br>
<br>
So what makes these other truths any less offensive than mine?  Is it simply that Christians will state it?  Or is it the fact that if you are wrong, the choice you make has an eternal consequence, and no one on this earth, but especially in this society, wants to be told that.<br>
<br>
Many faiths have eternal consequences.  Go ask a Shiate (?) (spelling is wrong on that sorry) Muslim what is required to get to heaven and I bet he thinks there is only a certain way as well.<br>
<br>
My point is - when you hear the message - is it the messanger you dislike?  Or is it the message?<br>
<br>
Think about that the next time you hear someone talking about God.  i personally find it extremely distasteful to listen to TV evangelists (not ALL but some) who have huge houses and drive hughe cars and do all sorts of healing right there on TV everytime.....  but I don't throw the baby out with the bath water...<br>
<br>
Also, consider this:<br>
<br>
In this society, many people have what is termed a &quot;salad-bar&quot; approach to spiritual matters.  You take a little of Muslim, a little Jesus, a little Jewish, a little Buddist, a little praying to your ancestors, a little but of idolatry, and you add it up to get your very own New Religion.  And everyone around us applauds because a person &quot;found something that works for you, how nice.&quot;<br>
<br>
My answer to that is pshaw.  What the hell do we need any God for if the above is true.  If we can simply make up our own new religion, like the celestine prophecy, then are we not God and is this not then heaven on earth???  <br>
<br>
Tell you what, I hope not.<br>
<br>
Even if I turn out to be <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> wrong</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, which no I don't think I am, at least I would hope that someone out there has the Truth.  I can say that WE are not God, this is not heaven, and everything cannot be the truth.  <br>
<br>
Alas, now I remember why I stopped replying to anything.  <br>
<br>
**sigh**<br>
<br>
Enough.<br>
<br>
Point is, everything cannot be the truth.  Therefore, there has to be a truth out there somewhere.  I highly doubt its something someone made up for themselves that happens to fit in neatly with the way they live their life, with all the morality or immorality included.<br>
<br>
Why is that so hard for someone to accept?  That there could really be one truth?  If you accept that much, the possibility of ONE truth.. then you might just understand why people want to tell YOU all about Christ.  They believe you have an eternal choice to make, and would rather have you with us than lost.<br>
<br>
Oh well.  I can't even remember what I started to reply to now, so I am sure its time for me to stop.<br>
<br>
Back to Lurikeen, whichever topic you answered first in your post - my reply to that is ah, I see - I of course must have missed that response -  as I stated, I did not read the entire posting, only the first page or so.<br>
<br>
<br>
Lastly, Lurikeen, I don't find it hard to believe that others find a spiritual life outside of Christ, I just think they have not heard the good news, have chosen NOT to believe, or have been deceived.  <br>
<br>
And I am sorry, but I do find it hard to believe that you preach love and truth.  From your past postings to me, which many were vulgar, rude, and antagonistic - well, I found NO love in those Lurikeen.  Perhaps you have changed, and if thats so, I find THAT very refreshing.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Lastly to everyone, I found a email someone sent to me and I really loved this quote.  Perhaps, this would make the Christian faith easier for you to stomach:<br>
<br>
Preach the gospel at all times... Use words only if necessary.<br>
<br>
<br>
Well, maybe I'll read replies to this, maybe not.  I just can't spend much time here, time is limited after all.  If you want to be sure to have me read your reply, please make sure you email me.<br>

I tolerate their religion, just as they do mine.  if they want to discuss spiritual matters though, I sure as heck will put the questions to them, and hopefully they do to me as well.  A great spiritual discussion - made in good conversation and with love - is always a great way to get to know someone better.<br>
<br>
So, if anyone has a sald bar approach, no I am not rude, however, I don't say how great it is, cause that would a lie on my part.<br>

What is right for me may very well not be right for you and vise-versa.<br>
<br>
You come here with God and Jesus talking about love and accountability telling us that we feast from a 'spiritual salad bar&quot;, picking and choosing the flavors of life while all the while trying to formulate our own personalized religion to accommodate our lifestyles!  How dare you (once again)!?<br>
<br>
/sarcasm off<br>
/flame off<br>
<br>
Aside from the personal remarks you made towards Lurikeen, I would have to say I agree with you considerably.<br>
<br>
If there is indeed only one truth, and there is the likelihood there may be, we could be fooling ourselves considerably by seeking 'open-minded' spirituality (in terms of religion).<br>
<br>
I would like to say a couple of things about the prayer that started this tread... We all have our personal convictions, some of the convictions stem from spiritual beliefs...some from rational logic...and some from both. We exercise these beliefs daily in some form or another. Where I feel the senator / preacher went wrong was is that he used the senate as a bully pulpit to preach his convictions. If he spoke truth or non-truth, he simply accused the opposing lawmakers of being Godless sinners who have ruined our country.<br>
<br>
If a atheist would have gone up there and loudly announced &quot;This nation is in ruin! This nation has taken away the rights of others by imposing religion!  Change before we destroy this land!&quot; it would have been no different in regards to imposing ones beliefs and convictions upon a group of people...it was rude...and it was done in the cover of 'prayer'.<br>
<br>
Although he went about it all the wrong way, I still support his right to pray openly. A very simple prayer along the lines of &quot;Lord, we ask that you give us wisdom and guidance to make the right decisions today. Amen&quot; would have worked very well and would have my absolute support.<br>

<br>
Really? ;) Well, that misses the point. If they are preaching at me then I didn't want to hear it. Preach to those who <b>ask</b> to hear the word.<br>
<br>
<i>"It just seems that you've had some very bad run in's with people who...."</i><br>
<br>
Yes, yes, I have heard this all before: "If you had just run into a <i>real</i> Christian" or "If you had run into a caring Christian". All such statements presume their is something wrong with the delivery of the message and not the message itself. Thing is, Lukaria, if I am not interested in Christianity at all (which I really am not), I will not want to hear the Christian message. Point is, those who believe I <b><i>need</i></b> to hear it and will deliever the message without asking me, or without trying to become a friend, are overbearing individuals who have exaggerated the worth of their importance. I have many Christian friends who understand that I am very familiar with their message and they feel no need to try to convert me. Indeed, I became friends with these people <b><i>not</i></b> because they preached at me.<br>
<br>
<i>"Who really has the close mind here, Lurikeen? I listen to other faiths, I simply do not believe. From your comments, I am led to believe you will not even extend that courtesy."</i><br>
<br>
First Lukaria, you are taking this far to personal. I am not attacking you, personally. If you want to lump yourself in with some of the Christians I refer to, then that is your business. Don't try to hold that against me. Second, I haven't stated that you have a closed mind. Why are you now interested in flaming me personally?<br>
<br>
<i>"However it seems from your responses that you have already made your mind up, we are wrong and arrogant because we think we know the truth, anyone who dares to speak of the Truth with a capital "T" is immediately an arrogant ass who is most likely a hypocrite, and surely - all christians should be lumped together."</i><br>
<br>
Lukaria, you are taking me out of context. Did I write that I think all those who believe they know truth with a capital "T" are arrogant? No! Did I write <b>ALL</b> Christians should be lumped together? NO! What I wrote is those who believe they know they have "the Truth" <b>AND</b> preach it to others without the consent of the hearer are arrogant asses. AND, I was perfectly clear that only <b>SOME</> Christians fall into that category. There is a big difference in what I am actually stating and what you think I am stating.

<br>
<i>"And I am sorry, but I do find it hard to believe that you preach love and truth. From your past postings to me, which many were vulgar, rude, and antagonistic - "</i><br>
<br>
Yes, yes, and you are not a very forgiving person, Lukaria. To drag that up and throw into my face after apologizing to you on this board and in game shows what kind of person you really are.

<br>
This is a generality, and you are lumping together people here.  You are saying anyone who preaches any type of faith message without first getting your express permission and/or becoming a friend - are all overbearing individuals?  Is this correct?  Does this extend to the corner preacher?  The ones who knock on the door?  The ones on TV?  Or only those you personally meet somewhere?  Or?<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> First Lukaria, you are taking this far to personal. I am not attacking you, personally. If you want to lump yourself in with some of the Christians I refer to, then that is your business. Don't try to hold that against me. Second, I haven't stated that you have a closed mind. Why are you now interested in flaming me personally?<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Actually, I didn't take it personally at all.  I apologize if you consider the close-minded comment to be a flame, especially when it was not meant to be.  Obviously, I didn't write that part well.  You probably skipped over my disclaimer about that.  So let me elaborate and try to clarify that.<br>
<br>
Perhaps a better way to state is this: From your comments both now and in the past, I personally have deduced that you immediately close your mind to others messages of faith, especially if they are Christians.  I.E. You refuse adamantly to listen at all.  Also, from your comments both now and in the past, I have personally deduced that you will not extend the courtesy of listening to a public prayer of anyfaith, especially Christian, because of the above beforementioned decision of refusal.  This situation is exacerbated if the person speaking speaks of their faith as knowing the &quot;truth&quot; with a capital &quot;T&quot;, and immediately you then classify them as an arrogant ass (due to you definition of not asking you first or knowing you as a friend).<br>
<br>
Now, if the above statements I have deduced are incorrect, I would welcome the opportunity for you to clarify that for me.<br>
<br>
As for taking it personally, I certainly do not take your comments personally on any level, however, I am a person who shares my faith, sometimes without expressly asking if I can share my faith first.  Sometimes, the subject just comes up and I respond to the openess of the conversation.  I believe my faith is the truth with a capital &quot;T&quot; and I certainly state it that way.  In this case, according to your definition, I would now be an arrogant ass.  Now, is this correct or not?<br>
<br>
This is from your post:<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>
<br>
Jesus expects people to be able to observe the lives of believers to the point that they can make a sound decision to accept or reject the good news. What that means is no bible thumping.<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>

True.  He also expects us to teach believers and non-believers his message of truth and sacrifical love.  That would mean sharing the gospel, that would mean reading the bible, that would mean bible thumping in a positive sense so to speak.  So.  I disagree.<br>
<br>
This is where I get the arrogant part from though.  Perhaps what you need to do is clarify.  <br>

Well, I must be arrogant, Lurikeen.  I think that by sharing the gospel in a situation where it looks as if it is appropriate, is a great thing to do, whther I consider the people friends or jsut met them.

<br>
Actually, I am a forgiving person.  I forgave you long ago.  You forgive for yourself and because God forgave us, not because you &quot;feel&quot; like forgiving someone.  When I forgave you, I didn't want to, but I did.  It was the right step in the right direction and enables me to objectively view your points without becoming personally involved.<br>
<br>
However, I didn't mention your previous posts to me inorder to &quot;throw it in your face&quot; Lurikeen.  If you read carefully, I wrote it is <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> those very posts</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> that make it hard for me to believe that you preach truth and love, as you stated in this thread.  Not impossible to believe, of course.  Just <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> personally<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  difficult.<br>
<br>
I will say, Lurikeen, you did not apologize in game to me, nor do I recall it in the board.  <br>
<br>
If you did on the board, I did NOT read that post, and therefore I now accept your apology and thank you for your maturity.  In game, there was a promise of no further flames, but no apology.<br>
<br>
That aside, thats not whats important here to me.<br>
<br>
What is important is that I obviously upset you.<br>
<br>
If my bringing up your past upset you, then I do apologize.  As stated, I did it to clarify why I had a struggle with your statement, not to belittle you.  <br>
<br>
You should know me better than that, Lurikeen.  I may mess things up when I write, but I am very rarely intentionally rude or mean.  <br>
<br>
You know how important it is to me that I represent Christ appropriately, and knowing that, in all the posts between the two of us, can you honestly say I'd pick this one to attack you?  Perhaps a lesser person might do that.  Not I.  It was not intentional.  So, again, accept my apology please.<br>
<br>
I certainly hope you will respond to my posts in the future, and not allow this miscommunication to leave you witha  bad tast in your mouth.  I admit when I am wrong, but again, in this case, I did nothing intentional.  (Ok I think I said that enough times now).<br>
<br>
If you are upset though, well, that means you MUST have changed in some way!  Growth and change are good.<br>
<br>
Ok signing off now.  I am late to a meeting.  I certainly will look back and hope to see an acceptance to my apology.  If not, at least you know it wasn't intentional, and I wish you the best of luck.<br>

Apology accepted.<br>

<i>"If you are upset though, well, that means you MUST have changed in some way!"</i><br>
<br>
I haven't changed. My other personality is on drugs now and can't speak.<br>

He/she who has ears to hear let them listen. :)<br>
<br>
<i>"This is a generality, and you are lumping together people here. You are saying anyone who preaches any type of faith message without first getting your express permission and/or becoming a friend - are all overbearing individuals? Is this correct?"</i><br>
<br>
No. That is wrong. Go back and read my entire posting. I am referring to <b>SOME Christians</b>.<br>
<br>
<i>"Perhaps a better way to state is this: From your comments both now and in the past, I personally have deduced that you immediately close your mind to others messages of faith, especially if they are Christians."</i><br>
<br>
Wrong again. I don't close my mind to other messages of faith. In fact, while you have been away I have had excellent discussions with Brutas, Quath, and Rheaton to name three. In my personal life (which is really none of your concern) I have many friends of many faiths.<br>
<br>
<i>"I believe my faith is the truth with a capital "T" and I certainly state it that way. In this case, according to your definition, I would now be an arrogant ass. Now, is this correct or not?"</i><br>
<br>
Wrong again. Go back and read my definition. On second thought let me provide it again... 'What I find arrogant is offering views as "the Truth" (with a capital T) when not asked.' Obviously, in a forum such as this we are offering our opinions in response to questions and comments posted by others. I am referring to "vocalization" of beliefs to people who have not <i>consented</i> to hear the words. You see, the difference is that I can skip your postings here altogether. I can simply not read this forum at all if I choose, but I can't <i>simply</i> change the channel if I meet you in the Senate chambers as a peer. I can't simply avoid you if you are my school's principle (if I were in school) and you are praying over the PA system. If you are on the street corner blaring your message through a bull horn while I am trying to do my shopping in a public market, I can't just walk away.<br>
<br>
<i>"Also, from your comments both now and in the past, I have personally deduced that you will not extend the courtesy of listening to a public prayer of anyfaith, especially Christian, because of the above beforementioned decision of refusal."</i><br>
<br>
Lukaria, I am chuckling because you really haven't a clue as to what <b>I</b> believe or would do. *sigh* I spoke at a Western Baptist church in Des Moines, Washington a couple years ago. They wanted to hear the views of an atheist and recieved my number from an organization I belong to, called me and asked for me to speak; which I did. I truly respected that church's pastor. I did a full hour of Q & A about "weak atheism". Not only did I know there would be prayers there, I was prayed for and expected it. Not that it matters, but I also attend a Unitarian Church and practice Chan Buddhism. What I adomantly speak against is the sort of doctrine that lacks tolerance. I make no apologies that you dislike reading my very strong opinions against religious discrimination and against Evangelical Christianity.<br>
<br>
<i>"When I forgave you, I didn't want to, but I did. It was the right step in the right direction and enables me to objectively view your points without becoming personally involved."</i><br>
<br>
When I forgive it is because I want too and it is the right thing to do when some one apologises, period. I am sorry you forgot my apologies to you, but just because you can't recall the apologies doesn't mean they didn't happen. Recall this apology on 12/01/01 under "Do You Believe in God"... <br>
<br>
<i>"Yes, you are correct to some extent. I apologize Lukaria. You are not deserving my flames."</i><br>
<br>
And, I did contact you in game and apologise. That is the sort of person I am. When I know I am wrong I can admit it and do my best to make what wrongs I have done right. Apologies are not cheap for me, and when I make them I don't forget.<br>
<br>
<i>" If you read carefully, I wrote it is those very posts that make it hard for me to believe that you preach truth and love, as you stated in this thread. Not impossible to believe, of course. Just personally difficult."</i><br>
<br>
Truth is Lukaria, what you personally find difficult about who I am as a real person means jack sqaut to me. When we are exchanging ideas in a written medium such as this we need to pay close attention and give each person the benefit of the doubt. I can recollect that when I was flaming you, it was more often due to the fact that you would not stick to a context and would not give people the benefit of the doubt.<br>
<br>
Frustration arises when people can't accept written words at face value, or at least be intellectually honest and ask questions. While you have been away Rheaton, Brutas, Maeri, Triff, myself and others have had far reaching intellectual (and personal) discussions because of the "give and take". Part of the give and take is dropping the accusatory tone you jumped into this with. There really is no need to make this any more personal than the exchange of opinions.<br>
<br>

Unfortunatly for those who don't share either of these beliefs, it comes across as little different from spam in my email box, or people who on meeting me immediately try to get me to join some pyramid marketting scheme. I can keep saying &quot;Sorry, I'm not interested in your mortage rates/religion/heath products/pornography&quot;, and I'll keep getting people telling me about it.<br>
<br>
Not believing in a God, I don't feel I owe any such entity the responsibility of converting people to my belief in His non-existance. And whilst I think that not believing in God is actually better for most people, I chose to respect others by not attacking their system of belief. I tend to separate morality from religious (non-)belief, and am much more inclined to try to talk people round to my views on morality, though still unlikely to do so unprovoked or unasked.<br>

<br>
My comments did include questions that required an answer personally from you, therefore I believe I was being intellectually honest.  You seem to think that I am accusing, but I am not.  /shrug  Instead, I am presenting what I &quot;know&quot; of you from this thread and others, and then asking if that assessment is correct or not.  Several times in this particular post, you answered questions clarifying your beliefs, and informing me where I had deduced incorrectly.  That is what I asked.  I have done the same in return, though often you argue that I am &quot;one way&quot; because of something I said in a post.  For an example, a past discussion regarding moral values.<br>
<br>
Regardless of your personal perception of my posts, I really do not attempt to be accusatory, as you put it.  I do get quite passionate about my beliefs, perhaps that is what you see in my posts.  <br>

<br>
As for in game.  I do differ opinion.  What you said was not even close to an apology in my book.  However, we can move on.  I have accepted your apology publicly now, and really, it matters not whether I get an apology in game from you or not, as you've given one here.<br>
<br>
On the subject of forgiveness, you forgive as an act, not a feeling, thats my point.  Many times I am angry and do not wish to forgive someone, yet I still do it consciously.  Have you ever been angry at someone and forgiven them - even when they never apologized for what they did to you?  That is what I am talking about here.  The act of forgiveness which is then followed by experiencing the forgiveness.  Not the other way around.  <br>

I clarified that so that you would understand why I wrote what I did, because I had obviously upset you.

An exchange of ideas is wonderful, and I enjoyed them immensely.  Thanks for all the interesting posts, those that made them.  Or for the differing of opinion.  It is always wonderful to read what someone else is thinking, especially when it is well thought out and clearly written.<br>
<br>
Good information there on your graphs, Maeri, thanks for their inclusion.  I found them interesting.<br>
