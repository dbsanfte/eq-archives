I have read all the posts about me and i am sorry to say it is quite amusing.  Where should i start?  Lets start with ...While trackin a named mob close to the orc fort i happend apon a bard killing it.  Well dang there went that. after she had killed the mob i cheared at her for a glorious victory.  althoug i WAS NOT the one who killed it i was however happy to see that it was a bard that droped him.  The bard asked me if i wanted to buy a pair of gauntlets.  to this i said no sence i realy wasnt in the market.  she then offerd to pay me100p to loot and transfer the items to another charactor for her.  To this i said no im sorry i cant.   Because i was in a hury and just stoped because i saw a named on track.  After the 3 min timer was up and no one had answerd her ooc to come loot it for her i looted the mob before decay witch is 2 min after 3 min timer.  i looted the gauntlets of the black, a 1500pp item not 5k with 30 second left on the decay timer. and there was noone on track so there was no chance of her getting anyone to cary them for her before decay.  After i had looted the item she then offerd me a weapon to transfer the item for her.  I told her i would gladly follow her and se what she had to offer me for trade for the gloves.  She agreed to this.  after following her to the orc fort where apon she went LD and i told my friends that i was trading an item for a weapon.  I wated there for 10 minutes while she loged back on.  when she finaly came back im sure she was suprised to se me ther.  But i had told her i would follow her to see what she wanted to trade ofr the gauntlets that she would have lost to decay anyhow.  i figured i would be able to at the least get a good weapon for a 5k set of gauntlets.  and at the same time be able to help a fellow bard.  im sad to say it did not turn out this way.......Well now we are 40 minutes into this follow the leader of her trying to find a friend to hold the gauntlets.   by this time we have moved to the bridge by the orc camp&lt;not the fort&gt;. when she gives her gauntlets to a friend and puts a weapon in the trade window.  without thinking i put the gauntlets in the trade window, then cheked the weapon out of habit.  as everyone does before making a trade to make sure they are gettin the right item.  well as it turns out she had decided to trade me a gnoll hide lariot for a set of &lt;5k&gt; gauntlets. aThis to me was a bit of an insult.  i am doing you a favor the least you could do is not insult me with a GREAT WEAPON worth the gauntlets.  and have me follow you all over the land till you could find someone to take them.  i canceld the trade and before i could tell her i wouldl rather have the 100pp than a GHL that i have 8 of in the bank she blew a fuse.  And starteddemanding that i give her HER gauntlets this instant.When she started with her threts of black balling me and my guild form high level raids is when the bomb droped.  i had another friend send me a tell and i accodently responded to him as we all do....Oops sorry wrong tell )  he he.....Before i could recover and retype to her that  that was not nesecary to make such threts she again thretind me, this time targeting my account.  That was the straw that broke the camels back.  at that point i petitioned to have a guide come and calm her down sence she was obvously to mad to listen to me when i requested the 100pp insted of the weapon that wasn't worth the time to loot it off the gnoll, let alone the 45 min treck accross the land.  i contacted the Administrative GM Frizznik.  i advised him that i had looted a set of gauntlets and that i ws not the one that killed the mob.  i also told him that the gauntlets where LORE and she could not loot them.  He asked me what the problem was.  I responded with, she is now demanding that i GIVE them to her insted of paying me for them as she had offerd.  He then advised me that sence they where LORE and that is the reason they are,  that they are the property of the player that loots the item.  She then started to argue with Frizznik about the gauntlets.  He repeted what he had told me They belong to the player that loots.  any other agreement you have has no berring on ownership.  If a player says that he will trade you item a for item b and changes his or her mind, then no trade will occure. a player has th right to change his or her mind about any deal before it is made.  and this is between the two players.  I then thaked Frizznik for his time.  I then told her to calm down at wich she again flared up at me thretining my account guild and good name.  so i took the gauntlets to the bank.  i figured she would calm down if i gave her some time.  i spoke with several guild members over this for an hour or so and decided just to give her the gauntlets to end the confrintation.  it is only while i was on my way back fromthe bank to deliver the gauntlets to her that a friend told me of the shit list.  i loged off to see what she was talking about.  i was enraged by what was said.  At this point i removed my offer to give her the gauntlets to end this conflict within my guild and with other players.  I then took the gauntlets with me as i ported to wc and ran to freeport where i /w all the zone and found a now verry happy paladin wno is now wearing the gauntlets.  sence then i have camped for the gauntlets 3 times and have sold them for 1k to 1.5k.  it was never about greed.  it was about respect.  i went out of myway to stop what i was doing to follow her all over the land to be insulted thretend and now my good name run threw the mud.   sence then i have calmed down.<br>
<br>
  I am once again offering my apology if there was a misunderstanding.  i am also offering my apology to the UPN for ever involving them in such an ordeal.  The members of that guild are the best of friends you could ask for. and i put our leader in a bad situation that im sure he didnt want to be in.  Forceing him to make a decision that was by no means easy.   I bare no ill fealings twords the UPN, or its leader who made a decision that i am sure i could not make.<br>
<br>
  This is my side of the story. I accept responsobility for my actions.  I am once again offering to make it right.  i admit that what ws done was done out of anger, on my part and on hers.  maby more on mine maby not i dont know her personaly.  &lt; out of game &gt;  But i do know that i still have no hard fealings twords her for the post.  or any of the others that have attached to it.<br>
<br>
  PLease dont read into this it is nothing more than my account of what happend.  and a formal appology to all involved.<br>

It isn't really about anything, but Jesy seemed to want it posted.  WARNING OFFICIALLY OVER!<br>
<br>
I had a long conversation with Jesy last night (he wanted to do something about getting Xian removed from our guild, as if something she did was so dishonorable).<br>
<br>
It started off civil, but the guy's not too bright.  He started attacking me, he wouldn't listen to reason... I can tell why he doesn't post here very often.  After reading his conversation with Xian here, and my own that I had with him last night (way to be the 2nd person on my ignore list ever), I can tell you for sure that:<br>
<br>
a) Jesy is not an honorable person<br>
b) He cannot intelligently form an argument<br>
c) He cannot have a conversation objectively<br>
d) He sure as heck doesn't know who his friends are, or how to treat them<br>
e) He's a slow typist and an even slower thinker.<br>
<br>
The post from revengefromme2001 is not Jesy, I will admit that.  Anyway, I had a long conversation with the actual poster of revengefromme2001, and the guy's got some serious issues with Xian, apart from Jesy.  But he's in the same &quot;shitlisty&quot; boat in my opinion, so the group can all stick together for all I care.<br>
<br>
For anyone interested, here's the converation between me and Jesy, from the time I figured I'd start logging it.  (First screenshots, then a log)<br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
[edit: conversation started off by him asking me if calling someone an asshole in public boards was allowed in our guild, and I said I suppose it would depend on the circumstances.  He wanted Xian booted and I said (after reading the shitlist post) that it wasn't gonna happen, that I didn't think she was dishonorable.]<br>
<br>
Kailya: I don't know what your bend is here, but I'm not going to have part in it.  We are about honor.  If you did something that deserved you being called an asshole, as she did, then i think there's no dishonor.  If you didn't, then don't go dragging my guild down.<br>
Jesy: OK so it is ok to call someone an asshole if they are one?<br>
Kailya: Don't you think so?<br>
Jesy: sure do ASS HOLE!<br>
<br>
[edit: me 5 minutes of laughing very hard.  hehehe.  i had been having a totally civil conversation with him to this point, he just lost it.  the guy has severe mental instability issues]<br>
<br>
Kailya: LOL nice!  How old are you?  I have NOT been an asshole to you.<br>
Kailya: ROFL she called you an asshole on the boards after you called her a condescending bitch?!? LOL LOL I can't believe i wasted my time talking to you.<br>
Jesy: yes the post i did NOT make<br>
Kailya: Well your account did.<br>
Jesy: I dont have an ezboard account at ALL<br>
Kailya: LOL ok then who made the post?<br>
Jesy: maybe one of your members LOL that and smoke it<br>
<br>
[edit: we later learn that it was his friend, and fellow childish individual, who asked not to be named, so not only is this a lie, but it doesnt even make English sense.]<br>
<br>
[edit: the conversation from here went to figuring out that he wasn't the one who posted the revengefromme2001 thing, but he still was acting like a total jerk.  Not only that, but he had a disconcerting disconnect from reality.  I had mentioned that I had seen the screenshots that she had used to make the trasncripts from, and he flew off about how he had just caught me in a lie and Xian was a dishonorable person for hiding screenshots (there was apparently some part of the conversation that Xian missed in the transcripting process).  This despite the fact that I said I had seen the screenshots she had, and there was no &quot;missing part&quot; in what she put on the boards - she must have either missed it in screenshots or it didn't happen.  Anyway, here's the important part of this section<br>
<br>
Jesy: And BTW a real life friend posted it and we sat down and had a huge laugh about her and her missing screenshot that you just admitted you have seen just now [EDIT: the guy's really off.... I never admitted nothing like that LOL.  he has very selective hearing/understanding]<br>
<br>
----<br>
<br>
Anyway, from there the conversation denegrated into him proving to me (and me reasonably accepting) that Jesy is not the poster of Revenge post.  Whatever.  He either caused it to be posted, posted it himself with his friend's help, posted it himself on his own, or his friend did it for him.  Either way, he was in control of it.  So I don't really see the difference, but I thought it should be said<br>
<br>
Anyway, Jesy really doesn't like Xian, even though she did NOTHING to him except not remove him from the shitlist =/ like that's her fault, he was a shitlistable person.<br>
<br>
But that's kind of separate from the shitlist thing, isn't it?<br>
<br>
Anyway, Jesy's hell bent on duelling Xian (um 36 bard vs. 55 monk.  Yeah.  let's waste everyone's time) and seems to think she was totally dishonorable for what she did.  &lt;shrug&gt; I dont think calling someone an asshole in a board called the &quot;shit list&quot; is really all that bad.<br>
<br>
And to Jesy's friend, who made the revengefromme2001 post, you're a coward for hiding behind a fake name.  I know who you are, but I promised you I wouldn't divulge your name.  That being said, your harassment of Xian, from behind fake characters and fake lanysboard names, really shows your dishonor.<br>
<br>
Jesy: Look, I don't know what your problem with xian is.  She's not gonna pull down your shitlist until it needs to be pulled down.  That being said, she didn't do anything wrong before you decided to harass her and threaten to sue her (BTW, as a law student, may i say... HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA).  SHe's not gonna duel you, she doesn't have to, and we're not going to pull you her out of the guild.  Best to just let it drop.<br>
<br>
Jesy's wife: The guy's unstable - do yourself a favour and get yourself to safety<br>
<br>
revengefromme2001's wife: You seemed nice.  Just tell everone involved to leave me alone now.<br>

I have no idea what importanc could possably be held by the amount of words i typer per minute.  But it seem to be one of the reasons you and your RL family have a problem with me.  As far as this post staying up here, it can stay as long as you continue to post on it all the things you find wrong with me.<br>
<br>
<br>
TO:  everyone reading,  <br>
  This will surely become a never endng string of comments and Jesy bashing session. i have apologised to everyone i can think of for the problems they have had with me, for whatever reason.   This will be my last post on this string. i will contue to play as i always have with dignoty and pride.  The coments and acusations made by others will no longer be my consern. I seem sure that Xian has &quot;personal&quot; problem with me and that is something we have to work on.  <br>

you're fine posting apologies to whoever started this, even though what you did was TOTALLY shitlistable, and an apology solves nothing. but i'm not hearing the one about 'sorry for being an asshole to you xian' and you were.  Spamming, taunting, threatening, spelling-poorly asshole.<br>

<br>
my &quot;typing slow and thinking slower&quot; comment was not about your typing speed, which is slow but forgiveable, its about your inability to think before you put your fingers over each key and press them.<br>
<br>
the only problems I have with you is that<br>
a) you called my cousin horrible, horrible names<br>
b) you called me horrible, horrible names<br>
c) you acted like a total asshole &lt;smile&gt; i know how much you like that word<br>
<br>
all this other shitlist stuff, i dont really know about.  i know that several of my guildmembers have complained about the horrible shitlistable things you've done before.  but YOU were the one who wanted me to post this.  so &lt;shrug&gt; if you don't wanna hear it, that's fine.<br>
<br>
and excuses/explanations aren't apologies.  apologies are unequivocal.  The worst type of &quot;sorry&quot; is a &quot;sorry but...&quot;<br>

For those of you who don't know the story, Jesy went around today and ninjalooted -- not only once, but twice -- Ry'gorr equipment from two of my guildmates.  I don't know why, given our last conversation, but for some reason I thought I could talk to him.  I was right, in part.  I only took a screenshot for the first few tells, but i'll transcribe them perfectly, then a BIIIG log.  For anyone interested.  it's between me and jesy, and then between me and jesy's RL wife.  It's really long, but it sheds light on the situation.  And when your own wife thinks you're not being very cool.... &lt;sigh&gt;  anyway, here goes.<br>
<br>
Kailya: &quot;Jesy, I heard you've been put on the shit list again.. what's up?&quot;<br>
Jesy: &quot;yup now they get exactly what they want&quot;<br>
Kailya: &quot;no one wants anything!&quot;<br>
Jesy: &quot;ryger&quot;<br>
Kailya: &quot;But the ry'gorr wasn't for you!&quot;<br>
[Tue Jan 16 20:49:04 2001] Jesy tells you, 'they wana cry about everything and justify it with there LOGS that they dont have.  now they get the rath of me and my future guild the ENTIRE shit list '<br>
[Tue Jan 16 20:49:45 2001] You told Jesy, '&lt;smile&gt; are you feeling ok?  you really want to be dishonorable?  i thought you were preaching to me about honor the other day.'<br>

[Tue Jan 16 20:51:00 2001] You told Jesy, 'why would you loot legs that weren't for you, though, i dont understand?  i thought you wanted to clear your name, not make it worse.'<br>
[Tue Jan 16 20:52:12 2001] Jesy tells you, 'i have to go AFK for a bit.  i was standing there and asked her if i could loot extra and she said no then ooc for someone to loot and i asked and she said no.  because of lies on the shit list now there true and now i will do what they say i'<br>

<br>
Where to begin? Just so everyone knows I have had a few conversations with Jesy. We talked in detail about what started this incident and thing that have made it worse. I also suggested that he apologize for his actions, and I am glad to see he did.<br>
<br>
I read through Kaliya's posts and I get a little insight into the problem. I still think that this problem was a creation of a misunderstanding, but your hot temper Jesy has made it worse. Intentionally angering other people is undoing any work you have done, and you are heading down the spiral towards blacklisting, getting the GM's involved, and finally being banned. Granted this is just a game, but for many it is a source or enjoyment, and I am sure you dont want to lose that.<br>
<br>
So it comes to this Jesy. There are still people here in Lanys who are willing to help you get your reputation in good standing. It will not happen overnight, and it wont happen without some tolerance on your part. You must play honoralbly and you must also be able to &quot;turn the other cheek&quot; if you are going to make it. You are going to have to improve your reputation one person at a time, one group at a time. Even with all that has been said and done, if you can see that being ill tempered will only hurt you, I still think that you can enjoy this game once again.<br>
<br>

Yes, I did have that conversation with kailya,but I was talking to her as a friend to stop all this nonsense. I am sorry to say that now there is nothing I can do. Kailya you have pushed it too far and it is out of my hands.  I confided in you to work this out between your guild and my husband and all that I stated to you as a solution  when you asked to did not even take into consideration.  So my question is If you didn't want a solution then why did you ask me if there was one available to stop the trouble my husband and others have made??<br>
<br>
Kailya you took everything I said and posted for what?  I talked with you in civil manor and talk to you as a friend. AND you backstab me.  I have done nothing wrong other then try to work things out.  I do not the purpose of your post other then it was uncalled for and showing a bit of your childish side.  <br>
<br>
After we had talked I had worked some things out with my husband and now I am sorry to say they are all in void because of your move to continue this thread.  If you all want him to clear his name and make things better: DO NOT EGG HIM ON!  I am shocked that this is continuing to further unnecessary gossip.  <br>
<br>
OK people I am going to give it to you straight.  The more you push Jesy the more he will push back and may even be harder then you pushed. Just leave him be.  Yes I have issues with the things he does sometimes but I don't nag at him to make him to do it again.  That is what you all are doing.  You are pushing him to make your life's on EQ HELL.  So I recommend please do not push him.  Please leave him alone. I promise you if you do so IT WILL STOP. Otherwise it will CONTINUE.<br>
