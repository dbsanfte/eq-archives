It is amazing you just cannot except the same argument for anything you throw.<br>
<br>
Matter is constant in the universe.  That is a perfect reason for matter to have always &quot;just been there&quot;.  If we could sit here and create and destroy it, then something else would have to be at work because, where does it go?<br>
<br>
The fact is it doesn't need anything else.  There doesn't need to be any God which creates it or does anything, it could very well just be there.<br>
<br>
Really suprised me the only reason you believe in God is because you don't want to believe in science. <p>Tuan {Cupcakes} the Vicar</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ubrutas222.showPublicProfile?language=EN>brutas222</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 170<br> <font color=#E9D756>(2/13/02 9:43:35 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=269.topic&index=215>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> re: Expectations and consequences of God</span><hr size=1>   I have a hard time believing that anything can completely 'disappear'.  Matter does change form, however I can't believe that it was never originally created or can't be destroyed either.  Just because some big-wig scientist hasn't proven/recognized that matter can be created or destroyed, doesn't mean it can't exist.  I happen to believe that anything imaginable can be true.  Not just because of how strongly you feel about something but because of the common link our minds have with the universe.  So, in a way, because we are a product of the 'universe'(by the way as far as I know there are more than one universe, not to mention billions of galaxies in each of them) our intellect is a microcosm of the universe.  In some ways, a galaxy is a microcosm of the universe.  What is the universe a microcosm of?  <br>

  I'll go out on a limb and call that, Religious Nationalism.  That comment is about as stupid as Hitler's aryan race idea.  How the hell do you know what God needs.  You mite consider  yourself a Soldier of God Cendan, but have you ever thought that a blind-folded soldier armed with a gun could possibly be shooting God's children, God's friends.  It doesn't take a Christian to be a friend of God or a child of God.  Your self-righteous indignation of people who don't believe exactly as you do are RUINING potential friendships with God.  I think its great that you take an interest in the bible but quite honestly people like you are what I consider the 'bad apple'.  Get over your 'God-complex', get humble and come back later to address people in the name of God, not in the name of Cendan's arrogance.  So many times in my life I have had problems with freaks like you.  Particularly those looking for Baptist and Jehovahs witness' recruits.  I have nothing against them personally but they sure do have a way of turning off God's big lightswitch.  <br>

<br>
That comment is religious nationalism?  And what does that have to do with hitler? I mean really... <br>
<br>
How do I know what God needs?  Well first off He tells us he is all powerful, that nothing is more powerful, in which case He doesn't need anything.<br>
<br>
The Bible, in the New Testament - under the new law, is very clear that God loves everyone, and wants everyone to repent and be saved, but outside of Christ you have no relationship with Him.<br>
<br>
<font color=yellow>It doesn't take a Christian to be a friend of God or a child of God.</font color><br>
<br>
I can only assume that by that you mean one can read the Bible and can come to the truth without the help of a Christian.  It obviously can't mean that you can be a friend of God without being a Christian.<br>
<br>
Here is some scripture for you.. read it and tell me how you interpret it.<br>
<br>
<i>1 And you were dead in your trespasses and sins,<br>
2 in which you formerly walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, of the spirit that is now working in the sons of disobedience.<br>
3 Among them we too all formerly lived in the lusts of our flesh, indulging the desires of the flesh and of the mind, and were by nature children of wrath, even as the rest.<br>
4 But God, being rich in mercy, because of His great love with which He loved us,<br>
5 even when we were dead in our transgressions, made us alive together with Christ (by grace you have been saved),<br>
6 and raised us up with Him, and seated us with Him in the heavenly places, in Christ Jesus,<br>
7 in order that in the ages to come He might show the surpassing riches of His grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus.<br>
8 For by grace you have been saved through faith; and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God;<br>
9 not as a result of works, that no one should boast.<br>
10 For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand, that we should walk in them.</i><br>
<br>
vs 13 goes on to say that those who were far off have been brought near.<br>
<br>
Okay so outside of Christ we were dead, tresspassors, wordly, disobedient, lustful, Children of Wrath, sinners, and transgressors.<br>
<br>
Inside Christ we are alive, loved, saved, objects of grace, seated with Him, His workmanship, faithful.<br>
<br>
Doesn't look to me that you are a friend of God unless you are a Christian (read IN Christ).<br>
<br>
<br>
<font color=yellow>Get over your 'God-complex', get humble and come back later to address people in the name of God, not in the name of Cendan's arrogance.

<br>
I share God's Word and so I am arrogant?  Show me where I am arrogant.  I have not claimed knowledge that isn't available to ALL right in God's Word.  I have, in many cases, looked up scripture to support what I have said and the response of people is purely subjective.  Its true that Christianity is a mix of subjective and objective evidence but saying "invite Jesus into your heart" goes beyond scripture, even contrary to scripture.<br>
<br>
Freaks like me?  People who believe in God and follow His words, or atleast try?  I assure you I am neither Baptist nor a Jehovah's Witness.  I am a true, 100% follower of God.<br>

I believe it was Stephen Hawking who said, &quot;The Universe just is&quot;. No, he is not saying there can be no reason for the Universe. On the contrary, there is. What he is saying is something like what a philosopher (WVO Quine) has said, &quot;To be is to be the value of a variable&quot;. In other words, those things that have an identity can be considered entities that can be quantified. Brutas has an identity and is said to &quot;exist&quot; because some entity has certain properties (that make up Brutas).<br>
<br>
All right, I am moving too far off... &quot;the Universe&quot; is simply a term used to name an entire collection of entities; in general, the collection of &quot;all that is&quot;. In which case, the Universe could never be a microcosm of anything. <p>Lurikeen Mali'Kyre<BR>

<br>
Cendan and all, I am a non-denominational Christian. What the above quotation from Paul the Apostle means to me is that God's grace saves us period, no questions.<br>
<br>
Human's are dead in sin by nature. Because of a sinful nature we can't see the need for salvation. Only divine intervention can help us see we need help from God.<br>
<br>
Cendan, I can't say whether or not you are saved, but reading your responses to Tuan, Lurikeen, Brutas, and Lith makes me wonder if you have really experienced the full grace of my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. If you had, then I wonder were you got the ideas that you can save yourself by following a baptismal prescription? I once met a United Pentecostal who told me I had to not only repent of my sins, but be baptised with precisely the words &quot;in the name of Jesus&quot; invoked over me and then I had to speak in tongues to prove I had the baptism of the Holy Spirit. If I didn't follow that &quot;prescription&quot; I was sure to roast with Satan for an eternity.<br>
<br>
Cendan, you seem to be saying many of the same things. So let me ask you this Brother: where does God give you the authority to question the grace of Christ? Please quote chapter and verse. It is by Grace we are saved through faith! Not by any act of repentance, baptism, talking in tongues. The evidence of salvation is in the heart, and ONLY GOD knows the hearts of men and women. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ucendan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Cendan</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/image/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 552<br> <font color=#E9D756>(2/13/02 2:42:02 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=269.topic&index=220>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: re: Expectations and consequences of God</span><hr size=1> Curran,<br>
<br>
We are saved through grace, the Bible says so.  There is no question to that.<br>
<br>
Okay, I don't know what makes this so hard, its right in the Bible, but I am going to point it out in hopes that you will go look it up.  Don't believe me... just go look.<br>
<br>
<font color=yellow>I wonder were you got the ideas that you can save yourself by following a baptismal prescription? </font color><br>
<br>
I have been very clear, very clear, that I have not saved myself, nor have I done anything to deserve salvation.  Baptism only saves you in the sense that it is the POINT at which you recieve salvation which is made possible by the death, burial, and resurrection of Christ.  It is the point that you appeal to God and you confess Him as Lord, and a desire to accept Him as Lord.<br>
<br>
The United Pentecostal was obviously wrong, so what does that have to do with me or with the Gospel?  We have to confess Christ as our savior for sure, but where does it even say that you must speak that out loud?  In the Name of Jesus, is a given and need not be spoken.  As far as the speaking in tongues... I would simply show him several baptisms in scripture where that did not happen.<br>
<br>
Now, you question whether I am saved and then later call me brother, not sure which you believe but if you have not been baptised for the remission of your sins then I know whether you are my brother or not.<br>
<br>
You can't pick out a verse on faith and say "look we are saved by faith."  If you do that then I can pull out 1peter 3:21 and say "look, baptism now saves you."  Doing that, however, you say that one verse negates the other.  That is not the case.  It is both.  Baptism is not a how, its a when.<br>
  <br>
Now, as to me quetioning the grace of Christ.. show me where.  I do not question the grace, the grace is a free gift OFFERED to all.  Lets compare it to a blank check.  If I give you a blank check its free right?  Have you earned it? No.  So, you go to the bank and you tell them... I want 1 billion dollars (sorry, have to warnyou here that it would bounce).  They are still going to ask you to sign the back.  Do you earn it by signing the back? NO.<br>
<br>
Now I know that isn't a perfect example but I don't know how to make it any more clear.<br>
  <br>
<font color=yellow>It is by Grace we are saved through faith! Not by any act of repentance, baptism, talking in tongues. The evidence of salvation is in the heart, and ONLY GOD knows the hearts of men and women.</font color><br>
<br>
So, if we are not saved at the point of baptism then when are we saved, please include chapter and verse, with biblical example.  After the cross of course.<br>
<br>
Let me also point out that 1 Peter 3:21 says that baptism IS an appeal to God for a clean conscience, through the ressurection of Jesus Christ. Can you please explain what that means in light of your theory of salvation.<br>
<br>
Now, let me once again state, for people who aren't getting the point.  I am a normal, ugly, normal intelligence person who has a hard time saying things in the perfect words.  I have done nothing to earn salvation.  I have not recieved any special messages from God, Christ, or any other spirit or demon.  I have simply read the bible, and encourage others to do the same.<br>
<br>
If you claim to believe in the Bible and it says "baptism now saves you" and you say you have not been baptised then am I judging you when I say that God says you are not saved?  No, but I understand why you would get defensive.<br>
<br>
I do not condemn anyone, rather the Bible does if you do not do what God asks.  To people who get offended I have to seriously ask... if you don't believe in my God, then why would it bother you that He says you are doomed to eternity in Hell if you don't obey?<br>

<br>
You can't pick out a verse on faith and say &quot;look we are saved by faith.&quot; If you do that then I can pull out 1peter 3:21 and say &quot;look, baptism now saves you.&quot; Doing that, however, you say that one verse negates the other. That is not the case. It is both. Baptism is not a how, its a when.&quot;<br>
<br>
----------------------<br>
<br>
I call you &quot;Brother&quot; by faith, hoping for the best. I can't say anything about your salvation for it is Christ who know the heart. However, your posts easily lead me to think that you don't know the glory of the grace of my Lord. Just my opinion, I pray that I am wrong.<br>
<br>
Concerning 1 Peter 3:21... the Apostle is not teaching that the act of baptism &quot;saves&quot; or that it even remits sins. Indeed, the verse reads better from the NASB &quot;And Corresponding to that, baptism now saves you....&quot; Corresponding to what? What Peter says in verse 20! Corresponding with the Ark and how it saved Noah and his family from the flood. It was the Ark that saved Noah from the punishment of God, but it was his good conscience that saved his soul, that made him a child of God. That is what Peter is saying, Cendan. <br>
<br>
This also corresponds with what Paul said, &quot;Buried with him in baptism, wherein also ye are risen with him through the faith of the operation of God, who hath raised him from the dead.&quot; (Col 2:11). It is FAITH not baptism that renews us. Faith in the operation of God's grace to change our souls forever. That is the victory of the resurrection of Christ. I think Cendan that you know of Christ crucified and burried, but do you know the resurrected Christ?  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ucurranedeton.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Curran Edeton</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#E9D756>(2/13/02 4:34:56 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=269.topic&index=222>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: re: Expectations and consequences of God</span><hr size=1> I want to clarify what I said about 1 Peter 3:21. I wrote that it was the Ark that saved Noah from the punishment of God. I meant the punishment of God to be handed out to the world at the time (the Flood). It was Noah's good conscience (as demonstrated by his building the Ark) that commited him to faith in God. Peter is obviously aware of the story of Noah. He is not saying that the Ark or the water literally saved Noah's soul. He is saying that if Noah didn't already have a life of faith, then there would have been no Ark saving his life! Pretty clear.<br>
<br>
Cendan, the act of Baptism is purely a symbol of one's already saving faith in Christ. I underscore SYMBOL. If somebody failed to get baptized and died believing in the grace of God and Christ, they will be saved, IMO. However, it is God that can only know the hearts of people. I am positive that there are many who have been baptized, but will not make heaven their home because they don't know the resurrected Christ. In other words, they never witnessed the divine grace of God in their lives which led them to an alter to repent of their sins. Make sense? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uulujainebonelphette.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ulujain Ebonelphette</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_cyanspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 797<br> <font color=#E9D756>(2/13/02 4:53:01 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=269.topic&index=223>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: re: Expectations and consequences of God</span><hr size=1> Where in the Bible does it say baptism is a &quot;symbol&quot;?  <p>Ulujain Ebonelphette<BR>

Not only is what you said wrong... its a dangerous assumption.  You obviously have too many friends that you are afraid to admit are lost so its easier to water down the gospel.  I pray that you stop inviting Jesus into your heart and start asking Him to lead you to the truth.<br>
<br>
As far as 1 Peter 3:21 someone could easily argue that what he was saying was that just as only those who came through the water in the ark were saved, likewise only those who come through the waters of baptism can be saved.<br>
<br>
Or you could assume that he is talking about how some were saved and then just saying "and, on the topic of being saved..." <br>
<br>
Don't like that interpretation?  Prove it wrong.  It isn't about that though... you are choosing to completely overlook that he says "Baptism now saves you" and further that it is an appeal to God for a clean conscience.<br>
<br>
By that way you quoted Col 2:12, not 2:11.  Here is something that I find interesting.  Read Colossians 1:1-1:2.  He addresses it to all the saints, and calls them "faithful brethrein in Christ.  Then in 2:11-13 he says lots of things, including "having been buried with Him in baptism, wherein also ye are risen with him through faith in the working of God, who  raised Him from the dead."  Important fact to notice here; he assumed that all the saints he was refering to had been baptised.  He did not say "those of you" or any other qualifier.  He knows that, following God's wishes, Christians are baptised so there is no need to wonder.<br>
<br>
God does not talk to hear Himself.  If He talks then He expects obedience.  To go read the Bible and say baptism is just a symbol and isn't essential?  I don't know where you get your information, but it is not the Bible.<br>
<br>
Contrary to what people here like to say/think... it saddens me that you don't know the truth of the gospel.<br>

<br>
Firstly, I am not going to respond to your obious taunts and flames. I have seen how you have treated others much the same way and it has gotten no where at all. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Leaving that aside we can deal with your response to my interpretation of 1 Peter 3:21.<br>
<br>
---------------------------------------<br>
&quot;As far as 1 Peter 3:21 someone could easily argue that what he was saying was that just as only those who came through the water in the ark were saved, likewise only those who come through the waters of baptism can be saved.<br>
<br>
Or you could assume that he is talking about how some were saved and then just saying &quot;and, on the topic of being saved...&quot; <br>
<br>
Don't like that interpretation? Prove it wrong. <br>
----------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Cendan, I did prove it wrong. Here, I will quote the NASB again:<br>
<br>
&quot;And corresponding to that, baptism now saves you—not the removal of dirt from the flesh, but an appeal to God for a good conscience — through the resurrection of Jesus Christ.&quot;<br>
<br>
The words &quot;Corresponding to that&quot; is actually the Greek word antitupon. The NIV translates antitupon as &quot;symbolizes&quot;. Baptism is a representation, a copy, a type of something else, according to Peter. A type of what? A symbol of what? Exactly the same analogy he presented with the story of Noah. Noah was saved by his faith in God not by flood waters or the ark and Peter knows this. Infact, the interpretation I offer is consistent with Romans 5:1 and Ephesians where we read that justification and salvation is by faith alone. Indeed, it is the sacrafice of Christ that saves. Baptism is the symbol (or mark) of our transition from the old life of sin to the new life of faith we embark upon as Christians. In Colossians 2:11-12 Paul calls this the &quot;circumcision of the heart&quot;. Don't you think a Hebrew understood that it wasn't circumcision that made one a child of God? Paul obviously understood that circumcision is a symbolic ritual consecrating a work that has already been accomplished. Paul the Apostle of Christ likens baptism to the act (symbol) of circumcision. Sorry Cendan, but I will trust that St. Paul and St. Peter understand the words of Christ much better than you thank you. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
<br>
Now if you want to disagree, Cendan let's see your proof. Up to now, and with every single post I have read from you, you just like to tell people they are wrong, but never have you offered reasonable evidence to support your view as I have just done. Also, leave out the taunts. If you want to embark on a scholarly dialogue we will need to get beyond that.<br>
<br>
Cheers! <br>

<br>
I am not overlooking what is being stated by Peter at all. Indeed, upon closer examination you will find what was written by Peter supports what I am saying fully.<br>
<br>
Peter is saying that Baptism is the pledge of a good conscience toward God. This makes perfect sense. If somebody refuses to be bapitized then they likely haven't witnessed the work of Christ in their life. That is they do not know the risen Savior. If you read 1 Corinthians 10:1-4 you will catch a better glimpse of how the Apostles viewed baptism: &quot;and all were baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea&quot;. Baptisms are rites of passage. Water baptism is such a ritual.

  It compares the dangerous of arrogance.  Religious arrogance and nationalistic arrogance.  What have they done for people?  They have destroyed millions of lives.  Just as Nationalism is an expression of a common culture(mainly those of the Physical realm) your religious arrogance is an expression of an attempt at a common moral/ethical base.  Its arrogant because it is done only with thought.  It lacks feeling.  No love in what you say.  God is full of love. <br>

Quote Cendan:<br>
How do I know what God needs? Well first off He tells us he is all powerful, that nothing is more powerful, in which case He doesn't need anything.<br>
  <br>
  This statement disregards feeling.  As if God is too damn good for us all.  Yes I agree that God isn't dependent upon something from me for his life to become possible.  BUT that is not the point.  Thats bragging in the name of God.  Its bragging in the face of so-called 'nonbelievers'.  They have their own reason for being non-christians but I believe that by you throwing Pride in God in their faces is destructive towards their freindships with God.  You can't make someone become a friend with someone else.  You can only Let them.  <br>
<br>
 Quote: Cendan<br>
I can only assume that by that you mean one can read the Bible and can come to the truth without the help of a Christian. It obviously can't mean that you can be a friend of God without being a Christian.<br>
<br>
  I know very little of the bible.  Have probably been to church 15-20 times in my life.  Both sides on my family consist of (90%) priests and nuns.  I was the only of my siblings that my mother didn't want to put into Catholic school, because she wanted me to make my own choices without interference from others.  I have always believed in God.  But didn't believe in Jesus until a few years ago.  But my relationship with God had taught me the Same values as those in the new testament.  No matter how many times I could read the bible, go to church etc... I could NOT believe in Jesus until I accepted him on my own.  He became my friend because I accepted him as my friend.  Not because someone threw some bullshit words at me.  I will refuse to have a 'friendship' with anyone based on intimidation.  You are presenting God as some uptight Micro-manager at McDonalds.  He is a FRIEND.  <br>
<br>
Quote Cendan:<br>
Doesn't look to me that you are a friend of God unless you are a Christian (read IN Christ).<br>
<br>
 God is Lurikeen's friend and every other athiest/agnostic that exists.  I didn't believe in Jesus when I was younger.  I had a relationship with God.  I was and will always be a friend of God.  There is more to God than the bible.  Is your God the 'Bible'  or the One who wants a Friend?  <br>
<br>
  Dont' take this as flameage, because I really do respect your knowledge and interest.  Be open-minded.  Life is a journey.  Everyone(or almost everyone) will make it to that destination.  ON their own choice.  Mix up the truth with love.  Ever have soda with no carbonation?  It taste like shit.<br>

Quote Lurikeen:  I believe it was Stephen Hawking who said, &quot;The Universe just is&quot;. <br>
  Hmm,  You do know that scientists speculate that there are more than one universe right?  At least that is what I have gathered.  Pretty weird idea that there is more than one 'everything'.  Do you find it coincidental that the structure of an atom is strikingly similar to that of a galaxy?  Electrons in the place of black holes.  gravity and anti-gravity-the see-saw effect.  Of course its speculation but it seems to me that the universe(as we call it) is bound by the same structural laws.  FInd it coincidental that explosion of an atom is similar to the 'Big Bang Theory'?  Anyway, I find it hard to believe that nature has always 'been'.  I think it was created.  No matter how far you go back.  Something was the catalyst.  Boundaries, laws, rules are created.  IMO  Those laws run throughout nature.  Pretty cool invention.  Something purely creative must have started it.  Within the bounds of the 'matter can neither be created nor destroyed theory' I believe the universe and all in it apply to this rule.  Just a thought...<br>

<br>
My comments were not meant as taunts or flames.  They were purely statements.  Regardless, I'll get to your post.<br>
<br>
First off you say I don't offer proof.  Most people who claim to follow the Bible consider the Bible acceptable proof when discussing salvation, or any other issue.  I have shown you verses... but thats okay, we keep going here.  Maybe someone will read this and know the truth of the gospel.<br>
<br>
<font color=yellow>The words "Corresponding to that" is actually the Greek word antitupon. The NIV translates antitupon as "symbolizes". Baptism is a representation, a copy, a type of something else, according to Peter. A type of what? A symbol of what? Exactly the same analogy he presented with the story of Noah. </font color><br>
<br>
Actually when I looked it up the greek word is translated "figure", as does the KJV, but I don't like the KJV so that isn't really important.  NASB says "corresponding."  I don't encourage people to skip between versions to find one to fit their theology so I am going to continue using NASB, which I hear is regarded as the most accurate.<br>
<br>
For this discussion however lets use the word you chose "symbolizes."  You then go on to give your opinion of it rather than using the words it uses.  Here is what you are saying it may say if you substitiure the NIV word.  <br>
<br>
"And symbolizing that, baptism now saves you—not the removal of dirt from the flesh, but an appeal to God for a good conscience — through the resurrection of Jesus Christ."<br>
<br>
Am I correct?  I looked in the KJV, NIV, NAS, NASB, and the Greek and all say "baptism now saves you."<br>
<br>
Now, you don't have to like it, but you can't get past that fact.  Even if it said "corresponding to the fact that grass is green baptism now saves you" you could not argue that it isn't baptism that saves you, you could only argue in what way the fact that "grass is green" is compared to the statement that "baptism now saves you."  <br>
<br>
<font color=yellow>Noah was saved by his faith in God not by flood waters or the ark and Peter knows this. </font color><br>
<br>
So, would you then reason that Noah would have been saved even if he disobeyed God and didn't build an ark?  No.  You are right that the Ark didn't save Noah, but you are jumping to the wrong conclusion from there.  The Ark did not save Noah, but without the Ark there Could have been no salvation.  God needed an ark? No, but God pre-planned the Ark as the method of salvation.<br>
<br>
<font color=yellow>Infact, the interpretation I offer is consistent with Romans 5:1 and Ephesians where we read that justification and salvation is by faith alone. </font color><br>
<br>
Okay, I am looking at Romans 5:1 now.  I don’t know what version you are looking at but I don’t see “alone” anywhere.  I see in the NASB it says: “Therefore having been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ,” which says that we have been justified and have peace with God through faith.  Now, you may take that as saying that faith alone justifies us, but if you do then you need to explain vs 8 and 9 of the same chapter that say “But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. Much more then, having now been <b>justified by His blood</b>, we shall be saved from the wrath of God through Him.<br>
<br>
Hmm.. now, we have to either assume that vs 8-9 negate vs 1, or we have to assume that we are justified by both.  Now if we say that vs 1 is negated then we have to find out what laws of the Bible were written last because only they apply.  If we say that both are needed then how can you say that only faith is required, AND how can you say then that baptism which is claimed to justify, doesn’t justify?  Further, the Bible states that His blood is symbolized by baptism so then if we are justified by His blood… well, never mind, I will let you draw the obvious conclusion.<br>
<br>
Colossians 2:11-12<br>
11 and in Him you were also circumcised with a circumcision made without hands, in the removal of the body of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ;<br>
12 having been buried with Him in baptism, in which you were also raised up with Him through faith in the working of God, who raised Him from the dead.<br>
<br>
<font color=yellow>In Colossians 2:11-12 Paul calls this the "circumcision of the heart". Don't you think a Hebrew understood that it wasn't circumcision that made one a child of God? Paul obviously understood that circumcision is a symbolic ritual consecrating a work that has already been accomplished. Paul the Apostle of Christ likens baptism to the act (symbol) of circumcision. Sorry Cendan, but I will trust that St. Paul and St. Peter understand the words of Christ much better than you thank you.</font color><br>
<br>
First I don’t see anywhere that is “says” circumcision of the heart.  In fact it is referring to the sinful ways of the life before baptism.  Now, you were quick to point out the “corresponding to” in 1 Peter, are you now going to ignore that vs 12 is continuing from vs 11.?  Note in particular the word “having.”   Having been buried with Him in baptism they have been circumcised from the flesh.  In which they were ALSO raised up with Him THROUGH faith in the working of God.  I don’t know how to make that more clear, and anything I say would be redundant so I will wait to see how you respond to that.  <br>
Paul is NOT comparing baptism with circumcision.  He used the word to indicate the cutting away of the old life, and YES, he did use that term because they were familiar with it.  Do I have to point out again that he is talking to the church of Colossae and he assumes the fact that they are baptized?<br>
<br>
So, the Apostle Paul and Peter (not St. Peter except in the sense that ALL christians are saints) do understand the words of Christ better than me.  It seems that all 3 of us understand them better than you.  Paul is not talking about “a symbolic ritual consecrating a work that has already been accomplished” but rather he is comparing the, to be blunt, separation of the foreskin from the penis with the removal of the sinful way of man from the body.  In the same way it is used in Philippians 3:3  “for we are the true circumcision, who worship in the Spirit of God and glory in Christ Jesus and put no confidence in the flesh,”<br>
<br>
Anyway you look at it, he states that it happened because they were “buried with Him in baptism.”<br>
<br>
Also, I would like to hear your opinion on what Acts 2:38 says…<br>
<br>
38 And Peter said to them, "Repent, and let each of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins; and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.<br>
<br>
Here is how I read it.<br>
<br>
Repent – command<br>
Be baptized – command<br>
In the name of Jesus Christ – command/method<br>
For the forgiveness of your sins – command/purpose<br>
And you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. – promise/reward<br>
<br>
<br>
Curran, I am not attempting to flame or taunt.  I will admit that I tend to be sarcastic.  Either way I do not see anything I wrote to you as more inflammatory then the things you have said.  Example?  <font color=yellow>Sorry Cendan, but I will trust that St. Paul and St. Peter understand the words of Christ much better than you thank you.  </font color><br>

We agree then that we can continue in a scholarly dialogue, it appears. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Cendan: &quot;First off you say I don't offer proof. Most people who claim to follow the Bible consider the Bible acceptable proof when discussing salvation, or any other issue.&quot;<br>
<br>
I am asking that you give a *reason* (apologia) for the hope of Christ you claim resides inside you. Merely telling me I am wrong is not offering reason. Providing an apologia for your faith is to offer reasonable evidence to support your view; whether the evidence is analysis of Biblical passages (exegesis), or extra-Biblical evidence such as archaelogical evidence. Make sense? Oh, Paul the Apostle commands us to do as such when asked. Just an FYI. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Cendan:&quot;Actually when I looked it up the greek word is translated &quot;figure&quot;, as does the KJV, but I don't like the KJV so that isn't really important. NASB says &quot;corresponding.&quot; I don't encourage people to skip between versions to find one to fit their theology so I am going to continue using NASB, which I hear is regarded as the most accurate.&quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
Actually, a thorough analysis of scripture can be accomplished by comparing various texts. I don't subscribe to the idea that there is an &quot;annointed version&quot; of the Bible as some do. Personally, I can deal with what ever text you want. I may refer to other texts only to help clarify a point I am making. <br>
<br>
<br>
Before I begin I want to be perfectly clear that I firmly believe what Paul said, &quot;... we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins...&quot; (Eph 1:7). So let me ask you Cendan. Is it the blood of Christ that saves us or is it baptism?<br>
<br>
<br>
I want to start by dealing with Acts 2:38. &quot;Repent&quot; (2nd person plural) and &quot;be baptized&quot; (3rd person singular) and &quot;you will recieve the gift of the Holy Spirit&quot; (2nd person plural). Repent is a universal command to all people (Acts 17:30). &quot;Be baptized&quot; is specific to believers only (Acts 8:12).<br>
<br>
Acts 2:38 is saying &quot;repent&quot;, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit, and each one of you (those who have already recieved the gift) be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins. You should note the greek word for remission (aphesis) simply means &quot;release&quot;. Compare with Ephesians 1:7 where it is stated that it is through the blood of Christ that we obtain the aphesis (forgiveness) of sins! Cendan, do you need to go and find the literal blood of Christ and bathe in it in order to be forgiven? Of course not. It is clear that we are dealing with symbolic language. A good exegete will always consider passages with all that has been stated in the Bible concerning the topic at hand. That is why I pointed you to look at what Paul said about baptism. &quot;Baptism&quot; has always been a rite of passage in the Church. Those who are baptised are taking the mark of Christ and publicly declaring what happened to their hearts earlier. You know Paul said &quot;I thank God I baptised none of you....&quot; If he thought baptism was essential to salvation as you do, do you think he would have been thankful not to have baptised? Acts 2:38 means to be baptized for (because of) the forgiveness of sins. We aren’t baptized &quot;to get&quot; forgiveness of sin. Rather, because our sins have been forgiven, we should be baptized.<br>
<br>
Cendan: &quot;Actually when I looked it up the greek word is translated &quot;figure&quot;, as does the KJV, but I don't like the KJV so that isn't really important. NASB says &quot;corresponding.&quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
Cendan, &quot;figure&quot; is also another meaning for the greek word antitupos and supports what I have said. It simply means a thing formed after some pattern. Compare with Hebrews 9:24 which uses antitupos regarding the &quot;Figure of the true&quot;.<br>
<br>
<br>
Cendan: &quot;Here is what you are saying it may say if you substitiure the NIV word. <br>
<br>
&quot;And symbolizing that, baptism now saves you—not the removal of dirt from the flesh, but an appeal to God for a good conscience — through the resurrection of Jesus Christ.&quot;<br>
<br>
Am I correct? I looked in the KJV, NIV, NAS, NASB, and the Greek and all say &quot;baptism now saves you.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
No Cendan it is not correct. Your are commiting a fallacy. You are isolating a particular phrase and then interpreting. The fallacy is called isogesis. Here read, Acts 10:47-48 &quot;Surely no one can refuse the water for these to be baptized who have received the Holy Spirit just as we did, can he?&quot; And he ordered them to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ.&quot; What does that passage mean Cendan? If one has already recieved the Holy Spirit they are a child of God! Again, you must take into context what the Apostles taught, what Jesus taught. You can't just isolate phrases and then draw out doctrine.<br>
<br>
<br>
Cendan: &quot;So, would you then reason that Noah would have been saved even if he disobeyed God and didn't build an ark? No. You are right that the Ark didn't save Noah, but you are jumping to the wrong conclusion from there.&quot;<br>
<br>
No I am not jumping to the wrong conclusion. God was able to ask Noah to build the Ark why? Come on Cendan, you forget the Old Testament stories too easily. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  God asked Noah because he was already a man righteous before God. Go back and re-read Genesis. It is clear. God knew that Noah would not refuse because Noah was already a God fearing believer.<br>
<br>
<br>
Cendan: &quot;Okay, I am looking at Romans 5:1 now. I don’t know what version you are looking at but I don’t see “alone” anywhere. I see in the NASB it says: “Therefore having been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ,” which says that we have been justified and have peace with God through faith. Now, you may take that as saying that faith alone justifies us, but if you do then you need to explain vs 8 and 9 of the same chapter that say “But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. Much more then, having now been justified by His blood, we shall be saved from the wrath of God through Him.&quot;<br>
<br>
Cendan, once again you are commiting a fallacy in Biblical exegesis. Here read John 3:16 &quot;For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal life.&quot; John doesn't share your sentiment. Neither does the writer of Acts 10:43 &quot;Of Him all the prophets bear witness that through His name everyone who believes in Him receives forgiveness of sins.&quot; Again, it is clear that we are saved by faith in the grace of God alone.<br>
<br>
<br>
Cendan:&quot;First I don’t see anywhere that is “says” circumcision of the heart. In fact it is referring to the sinful ways of the life before baptism. Now, you were quick to point out the “corresponding to” in 1 Peter, are you now going to ignore that vs 12 is continuing from vs 11.? Note in particular the word “having.” Having been buried with Him in baptism they have been circumcised from the flesh. In which they were ALSO raised up with Him THROUGH faith in the working of God.

Do I have to point out again that he is talking to the church of Colossae and he assumes the fact that they are baptized?&quot;<br>
<br>
*sighs* Cendan, you made my point. Here, let me cut and paste for you: &quot;Having been buried with Him in baptism they have been circumcised from the flesh. In which they were ALSO raised up with Him THROUGH faith in the working of God.&quot; Now again, do you think Paul understood that the act of circumcision made one a Jew or do you think he firmly believed that those who are Jews already get circumcised as a symbol of their belief? BTW, note your emphasis on &quot;thorugh&quot; and compare with what I am saying above. Again, pretty clear that Baptism doesn't save. Only the saved get baptised.<br>
<br>
OK, looks like I have responded to all your points. Please let me know if I missed anything.<br>
<br>
Finally, I want to share something with you Cendan. A senior pastor of mine who recently died and joined God in heaven asked me when I was 20 years old (trust me that was a long time ago!) the following question:<br>
<br>
&quot;How do you like your steak? Do you like it cooked or Frozen?&quot; He asked me the question after I had handed out tracks to the local Seventh Day Adventists as they were leaving their church. I was so on fire with my doctrine I had forgotten one thing. I responded to the question that I liked my steak cook. My pastor told me I handed out &quot;frozen steaks&quot; that day.<br>
<br>
Brutas really hit the nail on the head Cendan. God has always been my friend. Even when I didn't believe in him he believed in me. By their fruits you will know them. It is not what you say so much it is what you do. So after all this theological discussion Cendan I just want to try to be your friend. I know the risen Christ Cendan. I know Jesus. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ulurikeen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lurikeen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 325<br> <font color=#E9D756>(2/14/02 8:11:49 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=269.topic&index=233>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: re: Expectations and consequences of God</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> &quot;I think it was created.

Brutas, you are correct that there are scientists who think in terms of many universes, however the idea is that there is only one universe that is actual and the others are *possible* universes.<br>

I respect your view that matter was initially created, but don't share that view. I understand that the laws of nature have been with us since the dawn of time itself. What there may have been before time is a matter of question begging.<br>
<br>
BTW, I like your response to Cendan and I agree. If there is a god he would be my friend even if I don't know who the hell he is. Hey, I am open to that. I am an atheist simply because I fail to find reasons to believe there is a god. I am not anti-god.
