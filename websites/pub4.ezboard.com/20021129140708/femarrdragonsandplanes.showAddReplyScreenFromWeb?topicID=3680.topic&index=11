<br>
Things broken with this patch include (but are not limited to):<br>
1. Chat Channels are totally messed up<br>
<br>
2. Lag is unreal (even more than normal) for some people and those people are going LD on a repeated basis.<br>
<br>
3. Shaman/Druid Incomplete Heal is not affected by Alt Abilities but is affected by Focus items. Assumed that this is backwards.  Plus they have the wrong Spell Icons.<br>
<br>
4.  Taunt is broken.  Aggro is all over the place.  High Level Raids got a WHOLE lot more annoying.<br>
<br>
5.  Bards.  I have no idea what but they break Bards every patch so they had to have been broken in this one.<br>
<br>
6. LOH.  Personally I'm guessing it's a side-effect of the Incomplete Heals or someting. <p>Venerable <A Href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=6975" Style="text-decoration: none">Quistil Angelwatch</a><br>High Priest in the service to the Great Mother Tunare <br>

Many of you dont know it, but VI stealth nerfed us.  Absor even went so far as to TELL us we were stealth nerfed on our class boards (The Concert Hall, link available from cool dropdown menu at top of screen).<br>
<br>
Bards used to be able to stack numerous buffs that wouldn't stack with focus.  These buffs came form Dain's Hammer, BP of the void, and a few other minor items.  These buffs completley and utterly suck BUT for the fact that bards can stack them, thus use them.  Now?  There are SEVERAL 100hp buffs that, erm... dont stack with anything.  With focus lasting 4 hours these days (yay aa ability, wil get into that later), these buffs are never used except by bards.  Now we can't use them.<br>
<br>
Before we were able to stack proc's from weapons.  The most used were proc's of tash from Journeyman's Walking Stick and Orb of Tishan (plus a VT item that I dont have <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ).  Guess what?  Their tash's overwrite eachother now, bards CAN&quot;T stack them any more.  That makes slowing a hell of a lot harder, and in some cases impossible.<br>
<br>
All classes with dots get to stack them.  yay.  Bards dont.<br>
<br>
All classes have an epic they can destroy, and HAVE been destroying for 2 expansions (soon to be another).  yay.  Bards NEED theirs to be bards.<br>
<br>
Bards have the worst dps out of any melee class... inclusing clerics.  We have a target DPS (stated by verant) of 65% of a warrior.  Right now, with full avatar etc, we are at 50%.  I get outdamaged by my level 51 2nd box warrior using weapons i bought for 10k (think i'm joking?).<br>
<br>
Bards used to be able to stack illusions.  This was an extremely minor bonus for being a bard.  The only upside to this was that our werewolf illusion (which gives something like 20 atk and 20 agi) sucked because were would bob and weave, but we could overwrite it with dark elf illusion.  This was nerfed.<br>
<br>
We used to be able to give a tank 120+ DS.  Then this was nerfed to 90pt DS.  Now its nerfed AGAIN to 40ish, WITH the best items in the game.<br>
<br>
Focus items for bards?  nope.  Mana regeneration for bardS? nope.<br>
<br>
They even nerfed bard quad kiting.  How sic is that?<br>
<br>
We have the worst dmg/dly weapons of any class.  We are STUCK with a 16/26 item in offhand.  There are zero exceptions to this.<br>
<br>
Class balancing.  Still hasn't even begun for bards, and it's been 2 expansions and almost as much years.  Now they are going to fubar us up again.<br>
<br>
AA abilities.  You pay 18aa for an AE taunt that hugely betters your class?  Or 18aa for an attack that makes you hit for 1000 PER swing?  Bards get to spend 18aa for a SIX percent increase to songs that are singing based.  Or how about 9 for an ability that increases the range of GROUP songs (not AE songs)<br>
<br>
Planar AA?  We will go further into the shithole in relation to other classes.  Same in relation to Planar Levels.<br>
<br>
Paladins whining about heals and stuns?  At least you DO some damage when you aren't doing anything effective (/cheer 60dmg 40dly weapons that proc 200pt lifetap).  Bards get zero damage and now are reduced to singing AE mana for the casters.  Even AE resists have been nerfed because, /gasp, you still dont resist @#%$-spells with 350+ resists.<br>

These were bugs that were NEVER supposed to be there.  Yeah, I lost 375hp from this bug fix but I don't mind, it's STILL a bug FIX, not a NERF.  For this to have been a nerf it would have to have been working for all classes and only changed for bards. <br>
 <br>
Heart of the void is still good for soloing situations, or when you don't have a shammy nearby for Focus, The only thing I'll miss from Heart is the 40MR/CR it gave, .<br>
<br>
The tash stacking issue is also a BUG and has been correctly fixed (yeah it took em 2+ years to do it but it's done...). Tashes now overwrite or don't take hold as is appropriate.<br>
<br>

<br>
SIXTY PERCENT..... and Extended notes is 18 points for yes a useless ability. Increasing the range of group songs is foolhardy at best, especially if you're in the pull group.  The only &quot;useful&quot; situation I can come up with for this is if the casters in your group can't stand sitting next to each other and insist on being just outside the normal range of your songs.<br>
<br>
a .6 mod does not equal 6 percent... for it to be 6 percent it would have to be a .06 mod.<br>
<br>
We're not STUCK with a 16/26 for offhand, we choose to use it out of simplicity.  It's much easier to hit occlusion with epic in hand at any time than to have to remember to swap in a damn drum for example... In situations where the instrument effect of the epic isn't needed, I routinely swap in the following weapons depending on how I'm feeling:  <br>
<br>
Primal Velium Warsword, MAGIC, LORE, NO DROP, Slot: PRIMARY SECONDARY, Skill: 1H Slashing, DMG: 13, Delay: 20, AC: 10, STR: 5, DEX: 5, STA: 5, CHA: 5, WIS: 5, INT: 5, AGI: 5, HP: 50, MANA: 50, SV FIRE: 5, SV DISEASE: 5, SV COLD: 5, SV MAGIC: 5, SV POISON: 5, WT: 2.50, Class: WAR ROG BRD SHD PAL RNG, Race: ALL, Effect: Avatar<br>
<br>
Blazing Rapier, MAGIC, LORE, NO DROP, Slot: PRIMARY SECONDARY, Skill: Piercing, DMG: 17, Delay: 20, AC: 15, STR: 10, DEX: 15, STA: 10, CHA: 10, HP: 75, MANA: 75, SV MAGIC: 20, WT: 1.00, Class: BRD, Race: ALL, Effect: Burning Pain<br>
<br>
Shadow Tendril, MAGIC, NO DROP, Slot: SECONDARY, Skill: 1H Slashing, DMG: 10, Fire DMG: 5, BANE Greater Akhava: 3, Delay: 16, WT: 3.50, Class: WAR ROG BRD RNG, Race: ALL<br>
<br>
There are many other weapons that COULD be used in place of the epic in specific situations, these just happen to be the ones I use, it all depends on what you're doing. <p>Impresario <a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=36276">Kinbien Noteweaver</a> <br>

I do agree that no sober, (relatively <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ) sane monk would destroy their epic, simply 'cause there's only one or two places in the game where you MIGHT be able to get better gloves for a monk... and one of those is Vex Thal (been to Allakhazam's, drooled and cried over all the nifty toys that I'll probably never get to see unless some Magister person happens to walk by with them). <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=152515">Irulan Dunedancer</a><BR>58 Master <BR>Proud member of <a href="http://pub40.ezboard.com/berollisisheart">Erollisi's Heart</a>

Bleh? AoE taunt is 5AA's and is a crap fix to the fact that regular taunt does not work and all it does it stick the warrior 1st in the hate list to then fall down the list if they do not own at least 1 of the following 3 weapons<br>
<br>
Bloodfrenzy<br>
Hategiver<br>
Blade of Carnage<br>
<br>
All drop from AoW + encounters.<br>
<br>
All because the Taunt skill in effect does fook all.<br>
<br>
Stun aggro nerf has also killed the weapon I use for aggro, Blashpemous Blade of the Exiled, proc now does practically ziltch aggro on anything decent that I fight, pisses me off immencely.<br>
<br>
Warrior's really havnt been nerfed as such really recently but we've just never been improved since like kunark, oh woo we have a few more HP than everyone else but rogues can do 2-4 times our damage, monkies the same, paladins do 1.5-2 times our damage, and we can only use our defensive diciplines cause if we use anything else we cant tank better than a paladin.<br>
<br>
Chances we will see any fixes anytime soon 0%<br>
<br>
Changes we will get mega improved Bind Wound (175 point heals can only be used in downtime ! ) for 40AA points 100%<br>
<br>
Or new improved Rampage ! every 7!! mins rather than 10, I can hit everyoen around me for 60 points of damage.<br>
<br>
If you think you have it bad try being the class thats only point is existing is HP, a 2 year old dicipline, and the inability to do what they are supposed to do effectively without 1 of 3 weapons in the game. <p>Marshall Submina Dominatrix<BR>

<br>
I'm not aware of any Shaman that would destroy their epics either.  BAG the epic for a better weapon sure, but not destroy it.  The 1280 manaless damage is too good to delete just because another weapon has better stats and/or damage ratio.  Click it &amp; swap it out.  (Still waiting for something better myself. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> )<br>
<br>
So we've seen the following:<br>
Clerics-no<br>
Druids-no<br>
Shaman-no<br>
Mages-no<br>
Enchanters-no<br>
Wizards-no<br>
Monks - not likely<br>
<br>
The only classes I'm aware of that wouldn't want to pursue their epic (or keep it) would be the other melee classes.  I freely admit my knowledge of epics for all classes is limited, so I could be wrong.  /shrug <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

A little more common is paladins are doing similiar damage.  A warrior though can always use nearly the same 2h's that a paladin can and do more dmg(higher att, triple att, other).  There is nothing forcing those two 1h's into your hands.  The real concern is with rogues/monks doing twice the damage of plate classes(warriors/knights) sometimes.  Don't exagerate, nobody is doing 4x the damage of a warrior given anything near equal circumstances.<br>
<br>
As far as tanking, a warrior will always tank better due to not only increased hp, but also higher skill caps in various abilities.  Defensive/Evasive is not needed but does put the final nail in the coffin of knights main tanking boss raids.  Looking at overall balance, warriors may not be as highly regarded for exp fighting but they certainly make up for that in raiding usefulness.<br>
<br>
If all things hold, the new brells will not stack with the new beastlord buff(current versions of those two spells do not stack).  This makes the new brells very undesirable for almost all of the melee classes, why have 75 more hp when you can have 50 more att?<br>
<br>
Melee epics do suck.  Nearly all healer/casters epics are still useful to an extent.  But thats all due to the effect and not the ratio(which is primary importance for melee).  The bard epic falls more into the caster category though since its the effect you're using it for.  There is no reason you can't switch it out though for doing some more melee if thats your aim.<br>
<br>
Lastly, our new spell selection(paladin) is looking pretty weak.  With more mobs being unstunable one of our main spell choices is sliding into obscurity.  Our new buff spells are, predictably, not going to be used except in rare occcasions.  That leaves our useful spell selection down to a few spells, which has always been the case since Kunark.<br>
<br>
We've come a long ways since Kunark and thats definately a good thing, but if you see alot of complaints from the paladin direction its because verant appears to be making the same mistakes that were made in Kunark. That made this an extremely common occurance:  &quot;Hey there is a paladin LFG, you want to get him?  What are you kidding? We're better off without him.&quot;<br>

the sword of srra(emp)(52dam/42delay)<br>
shovel of the harvest(gozz)(this one not uber but its 50dam 43 delay)<br>
<br>
there was a similar discussion about this on the paladin boards, the MT warrior may do less damage then a paladin do to trying to keep agro etc, but a non MT warrior or a MT warrior using the same weapon as the paladin will outdamage him,  paladins weapon skills cap at 225, thats what a good 20-25 points then a warriors, thats huge not to mention that warriors get triple attack at 60 yes? a similarly equipped warrior will outdamage a paladin.<br>
<br>
that said alot of the time the argument is looked at from the warrior having epic or less and the paladin maybe having a lance of thunder or something (52dam 46delay) but that warrior could at best have a shovel of harvest (gozz vs telk who drops knight lance).<br>
<br>
shrug seems like warriors in general think they have to use 1hs always, there are some cheaper 2hs out there too like that war only 44/44 axe from ct i think? <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=15391">Tormarc Truelight</a><BR>

There are also two 2h's in ToV that only warriors can use that are nice ratio(galdarak sword and twisted steel bastard sword).  From luclin, Emperor sword and Seru sword are warrior usable.  There isnt a ton of diff in ratio between the ToV weapons and the high end Luclin 2hs, so guilds who can do emp/seru arent missing a whole lot in the 2h category.  Most of the upgrades on those 2hs arent in the dmg ratio.<br>
<br>
As with all gear there may be points in a guild's carrer that has weapons which may favor one class over another, but it all evens out in the end.<br>
<br>
Note about enraging weapons, they should be bagged until its your turn to tank...at that point you use AE taunt and unbag your ragers.  Thus there is no need to constantly use those weapons unless you are actively being the main. In that case you don't care about your dps, just staying alive.<br>
