Allow me to apologise on behalf of Shard Nire, being uninformed he said<br>
<br>
''you are willing to stick your nose firmly up some ones ass to get uber''<br>

When he should have said (if he was as well informed as you :) ) :<br>
<br>
''you are willing to sleep your way into an uber guild''<br>

Sorry for the confusion and i think that clears things up.<br>

<br>
Khael, after the response I got from you (and the other responses I got) which ranged from non-comittal to negative, I decided to forget about VS.  In my estimation, the negative feeling towards the guild was strong enough that it wasn't worth coming into conflict to get back into the rotation.<br>
<br>
That was the information that I passed on to Anastia and she picked up the baton and asked around as well.  She came away with the same feeling as myself and life moved on.<br>
<br>
At this point, I find it pretty hard to care what people assume about my motives any longer because it's obvious that some people are blindly prejudiced because of my guild tag and aren't going to listen to reason.  The truth is, though, that I basically forgot about VS.  It didn't matter enough.  I believe that Anastia (being the other active, non-epic, wiz) felt the same as me.<br>
<br>
That's probably where things got fucked up because we basically let it go.  We didn't keep at it or try to convince people to &quot;let us in&quot;.  We figured that if there were strong feelings against the guild, there was no point in pushing it.<br>
<br>
Fast forward to Friday night... Word goes out that VS is somehow up and FFA (this was obviously not the case, but that is the info that went out).  We show up and, of course, everything gets fucked up which is EXACTLY why I wanted to avoid the spawn to begin with.<br>
<br>
Nuff said on that... I have already had people take cheap shots at me for &quot;over-posting&quot; so I would ask that before making further suppositions as to my motives and intentions (and slandering my character), people at least read what I have written here.<br>
<br>
Gilg -  the statements you are making here really do not make you look good man.  You are basically saying that you would be unwilling to give someone you don't know a chance (that's how it sounds).  There are new people hitting the 50's every day, so the days when you &quot;knew all the 57+ people&quot; slip farther into the past every day.<br>
<br>
Now if we have members that you feel &quot;aren't up to par&quot; or you feel that our guild &quot;isn't up to Da`Kor standards&quot;, I ask you this:  what guild on EMarr is?  Why do you feel that we should be singled out because we have some less than perfect members and are not up to the old world DK level of performance?  How are we the *only* guild that, in your estimation, should be held to these standards? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/utonisthistlewindz2k.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tonis ThistleWindz2k</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 100<br> <font color=#E9D756>(6/18/01 9:52:41 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Dear Magister, </span><hr size=1> lol , mitch you love to cause alot of trouble =p <p><IMG SRC=http://nirecnad.bizland.com/Tsig.jpg></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ustinkfoot.showPublicProfile?language=EN>stinkfoot</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 334<br> <font color=#E9D756>(6/18/01 10:38:01 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Dear Magister, </span><hr size=1> hahahah mitch, thanks for the laugh <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ugilgamelavamar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gilgamel Avamar</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.acsu.buffalo.edu/~gcarella/10pixel.jpg BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 409<br> <font color=#E9D756>(6/18/01 10:50:14 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Dear Magister, </span><hr size=1> Ealan, you sound like a nice guy but its pretty easy to blow holes in your story big enough to drive a tank through.  You say you got information stating that VS was up and FFA. However, when you got there, and we were buffing for him, I guess that throws the FFA out the window. As to this....<br>
<br>
&quot;Gilg - the statements you are making here really do not make you look good man. You are basically saying that you would be unwilling to give someone you don't know a chance (that's how it sounds). There are new people hitting the 50's every day, so the days when you &quot;knew all the 57+ people&quot; slip farther into the past every day.&quot;<br>
<br>
It couldn't be further from the truth.  I have no problem with 99% of the people ingame. If you don't know how to play your class well, but you listen and learn, thats a boon, not a problem.  Perhaps I don't know all the 57+ people anymore. I'm sure of it in fact.  But I still know a sizable portion, and obviously when I meet someone new I base my opening opinions on them from the information I have.  Do they have a good rep?  Do they seem intelligent? The guild they are in.  As someone who did a lot of pickup groups in my time(I like meeting new people) I had to make these observations before I led my group down to king to die to an idiot_cleric_01.  Mostly, my observations were correct, but of course I was happily or unhappily surprised a few times.  I'm not getting down on these people, I was just putting the fact up there for the comparison you asked me to give you.  <br>
<br>
I don't have a problem with people who need to learn, as long as they are receptive.  We have some people in my guild who have had to learn new things since they joined us. Why, you ask, do I criticize you for having people you have to teach while my guild does the same thing? Because we at UI have no illusions of being uber. We really could care less. We're just a group of friends who enjoy smashin shit. I don't think you'll find any instances of us wielding overly large egos and ignoring the common courtesy other guilds are entitled to, will you?<br>

The answer: You are the guild I am holding to those standards because no other guild has brand new members who think they're the shit because they just joined you. That's the only reason I brought it up, because you have some new members, who did not help to build the guild, who have allowed their egos to slip out of control.

If you really count certain Magister members as friends, then consider how your words here are making them feel.  If you (and not just you, but all of the others) have such a huge personal problem with certain *individual* members of the guild, flame them and not the whole group.  <br>
<br>
Here's an example close to home. You guys have Mitch and Bubu in your guild.  Now I have NEVER had a problem with either Mitch OR Bubu and have no axe to grind with them.  You can acknowledge, surely, though that these are two figures who are often the center of contraversy and there are many people who (justified or not) have a serious problem with them.  How would you like it if everyone decided to judge UI simply based on the alleged past histories of a couple of members and the past mistakes of the guild?  You yourself admitted that UI was working to rebuild it's rep.<br>
<br>
I think you would expect a level of understanding that you seem unwilling to extend to us.  As for the &quot;new members who think they are the shit just because they joined us&quot; comment; it really sounds like you have a hard-on for certain individuals.  I can point out LOTS of people in ALL of the big guilds who definitely had an attitude change after they joined.  People aren't perfect and some people will inevitably have their ego swell on joining the ranks of ANY of the big guilds...<br>
<br>
If you want to discuss it, grab either me or Din in game because this is obviously going nowhere. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ugilgamelavamar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gilgamel Avamar</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.acsu.buffalo.edu/~gcarella/10pixel.jpg BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 411<br> <font color=#E9D756>(6/18/01 11:32:08 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Dear Magister, </span><hr size=1> Okey last post Ealan, and we can let the thread die.  Your statement about Mitch and Bubu is true. They may be considered shady by some people.  However, I haven't seen anything from Mitch and nothing from Bubu in many moons to indicate they are the bad people they are made out to be.  That said, if anyone, not just them, tried to do something we considered uncool, it wouldn't go down. We wouldn't allow it to happen. You let Kzz pull over us to kill us then killed our mob. You knew what he was doing and didn't speak up.  Obviously I couldn't be in a guild with Kzz, but if you're gonna be don't let the prick lead you around, please.  I like most of Magister. I just didn't like the fact you let Kzz pull over us when some of you obviously felt it wasn't the right thing to do.  As to if someone was criticizing UI the way I'm criticizing you, I don't think I'd mind. There's really nothing we've done I'm ashamed of, except maybe that mix up with affliction in hate back when we were Umoja.  Our fearless leader is by no means a prick, and we wouldn't even consider the type of actions that brought this thread on.  Maybe this should have been a Kzzern/Koryo thread instead of a Magister thread, but I do have a serious problem with some of your new members newfound egos(found when I played my twink, I usually get treated politely enough on Gilg) that they don't deserve.  When I see an auction for a type of item, and I respond with do you need so and so, and get a &quot;I'm in Magister what would I need that for?&quot; response from someone I've never even heard of, it annoys me. I'll be glad to talk to you ingame Ealan. Toodles....<br>

Trust me, we don't wake up in the morning and go &quot;Wow, you know what would be really cool. If we could train UI today.&quot;  Magister, like every other guild, uber, non-uber, big, small, roleplay, non roleplay, has its own objectives which really are based around making the game the most fun and enjoyable for its members.<br>
<br>
Furthermore, to characterize Koryo as a failure at leading Magister based on this one VS incident is also unfair. I've been in a few guilds, all with different leaders, and really different philosophies on life. In each guild, I can sit here, and I can think of a time when that guild arrived at a raid &quot;relatively simultaneously&quot; with another guild. I can remember the guild chat saying &quot;let's hurry, so-and-so is moving in, and if we don't get this now, we won't get it&quot;. I wasn't at the VS raid, but I can imagine that that's really what was going on - probably on both guildchats. You spend some amount of time to get set up to do something, and it's hard to just &quot;back down&quot; at the end. I've very infrequently seen one guild or another do that.  I agree, that's unfortunate, but it's not a Magister-only phenomenom.<br>
<br>
That said, I think we all agree that how this whole VS thing went down was not good. I don't think anyone walked away from it saying &quot;Yeah! That was JUST what we wanted to do.&quot; Magister wishes that it could have been handled better, we've even seen 3 or 4 Magister people apologize for how things happened. I'm sure UI wishes that it had been handled better. Noone really wants to be on this board (well, maybe Vendrix!).<br>
<br>
As far as publicly denouncing your guild and leaving it because of something. Well, I hope all guilds are recruiting people that have a bit more loyalty than that. The individuals of Magister may not and don't always agree with each other, but the place for airing those concerns is on our private boards not out on a public flame board. I can guarantee you that if I disagreed with Koryo's handling of the matter, sending him a simple tell &quot;I'm really disappointed in xxxx&quot; would be hugely more effective to make something happen than to come out here and get a 400 response flame going. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I have never, ever, applied to Magister. I've been in Umoja and then UI, and I'd like to think I'm one of the more devoted members in my guild. <br>
.....<br>
<br>
Just a point to clarify ... you did indeed express an interest in joining Magister. I know, I have the email and I did indeed place you up for consideration to the guild as an invite. I will not go into why you never became one as that would be a breach of the privacy of our boards and recruitment emails. Flame all you want, but please do not lie. If these people have enough respect to read your varied opinons on any matters then have enough respect for them not to lie to them.<br>
<br>
Mitch : I'm disappointed in your comment about Aamrie. It was uncalled for. And in her defense, she has made zero implications of any interest in joining Magister, even though her RL boyfriend is in the guild. She is very much entitled to her opinons without being called a literal whore. That is her personal life and has no place on these boards. I like you as a person a lot Mitch, and you are much better then that post.<br>
