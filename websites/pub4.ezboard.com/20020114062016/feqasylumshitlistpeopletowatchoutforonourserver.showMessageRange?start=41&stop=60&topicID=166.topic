These are the Leaders and Officers of Dark Whispers.  We will dispatch a druid to cary one of us(unless that officer is a druid) and remove him.  We need your help as we do not want him ruining our reputation as a guild in anyway.  He does not represent our values and is not one of us.<br>
<br>
Thanks for your help.<br>

<br>
Uhhh, as a recovering alcoholic (4 years sober now /em cheers) I don't know how you could function at the keyboard in the blackout stage of drunkeness, granted, I could drive my car home, hold lucid (according to the people I talked with) conversations, and even do some writing, although I could barely read it in the morning. So using the keyboard would be a bear. The blackout thing was always a good excuse for things I did when only slightly inebriated. (I didn't mean to hit that person, I was blacked out!)<br>
<br>
This person may have a drinking problem, but as an alcoholic, I'm fully aware at how effective I was as a manipulator. I could manipulate whole groups of people with lies and half truths, running strings of lies over various people to get what I want. Woe be to you who caught me in a miss truth. Talk about anger!!!! (Shoot, I would have made a great politician)<br>
<br>
As an alcoholic, I can tell you we are not the most trustworthy people in the world. It is not only a substance problem, it is a whole psychological problem. I have damaged many people during my active drinking days and had to spend many years trying to make amends, some I may never be able to make, but life goes on.<br>
<br>
Sorry for the ramblings but I want to do a few things here.<br>
<br>
1.) Please don't trust an alcoholic! I hope those that know me in game feel I'm honorable and forthright and for those that have dealt with my alcoholic anger and attitude I'm truly sorry. (I do tend to blow up when pushed too far and that is wrong) You must understand that with this disease, sanity goes out the door...period. Would you trust an insane person?<br>
<br>
2.) Uzziell, if you are indeed using blackouts and drinking as an excuse for your behavior. SEEK HELP! I hate to be one of those &quot;Big Book&quot; thumping AAers but it is a filty rotten disease that hurts the people closest the most. If you get to my level in the disease you will lose your family, home, and assets. Trust me, I've done it and fear going back to that lifestyle.<br>
<br>
3.) Yes, I'm a flaming alcoholic, but damnit I'm sober and still have a damned fun time!! Again, those that grouped with me know of the warped humor I have. You try being sober in the United States' number one state for alcoholism!!!<br>
<br>
4.) I don't condone Uzziell's behavior nor do I forgive him. I mearly empathize with him and with you the Lanys community for dealing with him as I empathized with my community for having to deal with me.<br>
<br>
Again, sorry for the rant but I guess it is something that should be stated. If nothing else, it gave me a chance to tighten my grip on sobriety.<br>
<br>
/em thanks Lanys for the soapbox.<br>

Cool, thanks Neesha now I found another addiction. I can get hooked on EBAY, lose my wife, house, car and assets, end up living in the Qeynos sewers and go through rehab again.<br>

Hello, my name is Uily, I'm an EBAYer and it's been 3 months since my last EBAY sale! (crowd goes &quot;Hi Uily&quot;)<br>

LOL, I could see it now!<br>

On a serious note, I wonder if this guy is supporting his habit using farmed items? If so, then that makes the people who buy them enablers. Kind of a wierd thought! Where does the line between RL and EQ end?<br>

I tried my man - as did our whole guild ... I even got RoF (whom he wounded in the past) to let him come on raids.  I talked countless hours while trying to help him get stuff like runed cowl and SMR over issues.  I listened and gave advise when asked.  In the end my friend, he struck out just like Tarot said he would.<br>
<br>
Pity - yes perhaps - I am one to give much mercy ... but blindness or unjustified mercy - no - people need to be aware of his actions and what they might risk IF they choose to embrace him. <p><center>

I have no sympathy for people who use the &quot;sorry I was drunk&quot; excuse. I would suggest others do the same.

<br>
I joined a 4c group and we headed there, we had heard that top was camped so we camped the bottom.<br>
<br>
He runs down to us and begins to ks EVERY pull with 2 or 3 nukes.  I get seriously pissed and i /ge him.<br>
<br>
He says 'petitioned'<br>
<br>
I go 'great maybe we can get you the hell outta here'<br>
<br>
No gms come for 30 min and someone says if we dont kill things im gonna leave<br>
<br>
So we begin to kill again and i see him run off back the tower, then Uzziel begins to casta spell<br>
<br>
I go 'damn hes gonna KS' but he didn't he left, so i thought good.<br>
Finally the Archon spawns and i could use the belt that he drops a lot, we pull and guess who appears next to us? Uzziel<br>
<br>
He nukes it to the ground and gets the kill<br>
We ask politely 'Can we have the bottom? please'<br>
He answers 'Yes i said so already, just dont pull the upper stuff'<br>
Our SK jumps in 'Can i loot the decayed you get?'<br>
he answers 'Sure'<br>
<br>
So we continue, were getting pretty good exp and then our SK goes &quot;brb i gotta get the deacyed =)'<br>
<br>
Well im watching him life and hes running up there and then Uzziel shouted 'Train to zone! Have fun lower 4c group!'<br>
<br>
I am so deeply pissed, the only reason hed do this is to kill us, and that he did.  We couldn't get our SK rezzed and he was bound in Qeynos! (god knows why)<br>
I had to log and i ended that day.<br>

The purpose to post here is to reveal MORE facts of a recent event that adds to the validity of what some considered &quot;witch hunts&quot; in the day.<br>
<br>
Please consider the following threads:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://pub47.ezboard.com/fmonarchycommunityfrm1.showMessage?topicID=209.topic">pub47.ezboard.com/fmonarc...=209.topic</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>

<br>
Obvoiusly - the point that I am making is NOT that people don't have goals and should just throw them away - but in light of a repeating phenomenon which is that Uzziell is only loyal as it benefits him in the scope of things.<br>
<br>
Does it even matter that I post this now - he is after all 60th lvl and epic (last time I had seen him).  He is a very good wizard to say the least - and knows how to play his class well.  But his loyaties run thin when his own goals are being delayed.<br>
<br>
He has proven to jump from guild to guild on this server - that is the bottom line.  Just because he is knowledgable and obviously a 60 wiz is powerful - does not mean that even in any GUILD - that after he gets what he wants that he will be on his way.<br>
<br>
But if you look at gear given for time in service as just a part of it - then I have ranted for no reason.<br>
<br>
Once again - hopefully I am not just doing a &quot;told you so&quot; move by posting - that pride is NOT in my heart for posting - but once again - warning the next guild that would take Uzziell in that they too would not be used to the end of their resource and then left for someone else. <p><center><Table width=550 border=0><tr><td valign=top align=center colspan=2><center><img src="http://www.kerinakreation.com/images/sigs/istsig.jpg" border=0 alt="Guild Leader of Dark Whispers"></center></td></tr><tr><td valign=top align=center><i><font color="red"><b>Istrahd V'Zarovich<b></i><br>58th Defiler<br>Dark Whispers<br></font></td><td valign=middle align=center><font size=-1><i>"I am The Ancient, I am The Land.

<br>
Istrahd, I have only heard and seen good about and from you. I have to say this set of posting disappoints me, and makes me wonder if I have been fooled. Yes I am a member of RotA, have been for a year or so. <br>
<br>
What is the point of dragging these 3 post back up? Has he done anything recently to warrant this post. So he left a guild, so what. So he has a history of guild jumping ...so what. If the guild that accepts him can live with that rep, that is their choice. Up to this point Uzziell has been fine. Yes he seems very driven to do raid etc. /shrug so what. If he moves on, that is his choice to make. <br>
<br>
As far as posting the links, I don't think you should have done that. What does it prove? I don't think MoTD(diacide) knows a significant portion of RotA. Yes we have had our &quot;winners&quot;. Yes we may be slow to throw them out. I personally rather try to help a person rather than just discard them, maybe I am naive. That Diacide (who I don't know, yet seem to be dispised by) is pissed that someone left his guild, and had the gall to go to a guild he does not like. I can't believe how often people defend a guildie to extremes and then turn on them as soon as they move on. Kind of immature. <br>
<br>
Now I have to go post this in the other 2 post you HAD to drag back up along with this one. <br>

Answer:  but once again - warning the next guild that would take Uzziell in that they too would not be used to the end of their resource and then left for someone else.<br>

In no way was I trying to hurt the reputation of RoTA (I do have friends in ROTA - and in fact helped even a rogue of yours get the general last night in Kith) - in fact - my heart was to warn you if possible by showing you a trend.  Please consider my post in it's entirety and don't assume that I am dragging up things just to drag them up.  The point of this list is if there is evidence - and this was yet another event to back up the validity of what was forewarned before. <p><center><Table width=550 border=0><tr><td valign=top align=center colspan=2><center><img src="http://www.kerinakreation.com/images/sigs/istsig.jpg" border=0 alt="Guild Leader of Dark Whispers"></center></td></tr><tr><td valign=top align=center><i><font color="red"><b>Istrahd V'Zarovich<b></i><br>58th Defiler<br>Dark Whispers<br></font></td><td valign=middle align=center><font size=-1><i>"I am The Ancient, I am The Land.

Uzziell's claim to have left Everquest is a FALSE CLAIM.  This shit head is back, under a new name - Psycotic.  Mohjoh should be posting a screenshot of him admitting this under the &quot;MOHJOH&quot; thread in the shit list, though this may soon be moved to R&amp;R.  If I knew how to post my screenshot, I would, but I don't, so.. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :\ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":\"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Actually, I was referring to the Mohjoh thread being moved.. either to Rants and Raves or just being deleted. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
