<br>
Not knowing it was a terrorist act at first I was simply awestricken by the crash, the casualties, and the endangerment of everyone in the building.<br>
<br>
When the second plane crashed, I was watching as it happened.  I walked to the television and fell to my knees in disbelief.  I cried and screamed as the events carried on, and as the buildings tumbled... it was one of the coldest days of my life.  <br>
<br>
I remember it like yesterday, and though Im one of those people who didnt want to look back and dwell on it, I think mentally and emotionally that day has had more of an impact on my life than I ever dreamed - though directly it had no immediate effect on my life, or so I thought.  <br>
<br>
Today, yesterday, the last few days the anticipation of the "anniversary" has put much emotional strain on me along with everything else that's happened since then.

I had a fun day planned as it was my birthday.  I turned on the tv after the first plane had hit, before the second, and just watched in horror. <br>
<br>
At first the news reported it as a freak accident. While reporting live from the accident scene the second plane hit the second tower.  I felt every emotion you could imagine as I sat there and watched the news that morning. <br>
<br>
I watched in horror as over 100 fire fighters and police officers ran into the buildings, thinking only of the people they were trying to rescue, and not a second of themselves or their safety.  Seeing the towers  come crashing down, with most of them still inside is a horrific sight I wish I hadnt seen that morning. <br>
<br>
A year later, the thoughts and memories of this day are still very close.  I no longer think of this day as my birthday.  While it is the day I become a year older, to my family its now remembered and celebrated differently.  <br>
<br>
My children will never again attend school on this day. This will be a day we honor heroes, and remember the many thousands of people who lost their lives. I'm not exactly sure what family traditions we will set for this day, whether it be delivering flowers/cookies to  our local fire men, or attending the parades in our city.  <br>
<br>
I'll never forget the events of that day, I only hope I never have to sit my three children down and try and explain any tragedy like this again.<br>

Because of this, we were told a little before the rest of the school. On the way to third period, only our class knew what had actually happened. Everyone else was acting as they usually do, wandering about the places, getting from place to place. As third period began, an announcement went over the loudspeaker from my teacher as to what happened. We listened to the radio for the rest of the class period. <p><center><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=8504><font size="1" face="Courier New">Inventory</font></a><br><img src=http://members.cox.net/confused007/stuff/wherefromhere.jpg></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uheelan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Heelan</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_lightning.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 155<br> <font color=#E9D756>(9/11/02 5:37:52 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=261.topic&index=31>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Where were you on 9/11/01 when you heard about it?</span><hr size=1> I work 2nd shift, so I had only been asleep for about 5 or 6 hours when my mom's voice woke me up on the answering machine.  She was saying "Turn on your TV, a passenger jet has crashed into the World Trade Center."   Hearing this while I was half asleep, it almost seemed like a dream...really a nightmare.  When I realized I was not dreaming, I jumped out of the bed and ran to the living room to turn on the TV.  Just seconds after I turned on the TV, I watched the second plane crash into the 2nd building. <br>
<br>
I called my mom back to ask her what had happened, as I watched the news looking for more answers.  As I watched, I couldn't believe what I was seeing.  I eventually had to drag myself from the TV so I could get ready to go to school, and when I got there it was all anyone was talking about.  All of the TV's in the school were turned on to the news.  <br>
<br>
I still cannot believe all of the things I saw that day, even though I have that days news recorded on a VHS tape.  It will be one of those days I will never forget. <p><BR>
