I dreamed of becoming an adventurer, travelling the world and fighting evil!  As I was sitting there I heard a commotion coming from the guard house so I ran over quickly to see what the crowd was looking at.  He wore the symbol of the Ashen Order so he must have been a monk.  I've seen many monks living in freeport and grew up watching them train at the dojo, but this one wore the training robe of another order.  He was badly injured and could barely walked, he collapsed and the guards must have dragged him to the guardhouse and gave him some water to drink.  I ran to the dojo and alerted Puab that a strange monk was injured at the guard house.  Puab followed me to the guard house and I showed him to the monk in question.  "Ryntis!" he exclaimed.  "We havent seen you in years, what happened to you?".  Ryntis looked up and responded to Puab, "Im dieing sensai, I returned to tell my tale, so that I am remembered after my death." Puab and the guards helped Ryntis back to the dojo and Puab called the scribe.. and I listened through a window as he told them his life's story.<br>
<br>
Ryntis was trained by the Ashen Order, they then sent him off to complete his training in the real world.  He told of distant places, of gnomes and elves, of kobolds and gnolls, of dragons and gods.  He told of his defeats and his victories.  Of the other planes and of his training.. of the secret order of the whistling fist and of story behind the celestial fists.  He told of an battle against the dogs that had taken over an ancient castle in the Dreadlands.. and how he fell in battle and was defeated for good..  He told of the great army of shadows that taught him friendship and brotherhood.  And how his last wish in life was to train an adventurer, so that they may follow in his footsteps.<br>
<br>
All got quiet in the dojo, I wondered what was going on inside but was afraid to look, as they would see me.  Then all of a sudden I felt two hands clasp my shoulders and p ull me into the building through the window.  "I think he was spying on us" one monk laughed.  "Perhaps he is the one" Ryntis raised his eyebrow, "Curious and steathy.. would you like to be an adventurer? young one" I looked up at him and nodded my head.  And so began my training.<br>
<br>
First he tried to teach me hand to hand.  We trained in the commonlands for days, I learned a little but couldnt quite get the aim down.  Frustrated Ryntis moved onto weapons.. He taught me the art of wielding weapons, and I adapted it to swords, he was proud but I still couldnt hit as quickly as he would like.  In the Nektulos Forest I was practicing my technique on the huge spiders there under the watch of Ryntis when Travis greeted us. "Hello friends" he said, "A monk in training I see, how goes the training?" and Ryntis responded "not well, he lacks the speed and agility needed to attack quickly, but everyone has some skill that they can hone for battle, we just havent found it yet"  Travis looked down at me and started singing a song my mother used to sing to me as a child, and asked "do you know it?" I nodded and he motioned for me to sing.. so I did.. They both looked at me for some time when I finished and Travis patted Ryntis on the back and said "There you go" and handed something to Ryntis.. Ryntis nodded and motioned me to come forward.<br>
<br>
He handed me a letter and told me to go to north freeport where there is a guild of bards.  They will teach me to use my voice to influence the world.. and he told me to come back when my training with them was complete.  And so I followed his orders and was put under the wing of the freeport school of song.  They taught me all that I know now about singing and instrument playing. And so I returned to the Ashen Order to finish my training under Ryntis.  When I arrived I was met at the door by Puab, "Disease took him in his sleep last night, young one" he said, "But you are ready to complete your training in the real world, theres nothing more he could teach you" A tear fell down my face as he handed me the battle gear that Ryntis wore along with the little cash that he had put away.  "This is yours now, follow in his footsteps and return to that castle he spoke of.. and avenge his death"</font><P>-~{ Decurro Dulcidine }~-<P><i></i></TD></TR><TR BGCOLOR=#E5E5E6><TD NOWRAP width=20% valign=top align=left><B><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2><A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/udecurrodulcidine.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Decurro Dulcidine</A></FONT></B><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>p0\/\/3r-p0sT3r!</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>(</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#000033>5/3/01</FONT> <FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#000033>9:43:27 am</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>)<BR></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT><B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">Re: Trained by the elite, and on a mission!</font></B><HR><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">I continued my training and traveled out into the desert, with very little food or water I gained the skills needed to survive in the harsh conditions of Norrath.. I joined a small militia there that was fighting the evil orcish hoard. The fight seemed as if it would last forever.. but my fighting skills grew stronger and stronger until even the strongest of the orcs were no match for me.. I would run across the dunes killing orc after orc with no troubles.. I then saw a raft wash up onto the shore by the dock.. I decided to make my way out onto the ocean to find the isle of Kunark of which my master spoke.  After a day on the ocean my eyes caught a glimpse of an island off in the distance! I paddled as fast as I could and swam the rest of the way to the island..  It was inhabited by a group of ogres, whom I hid from in a small cave in the nearby rock face.  I heard one speak of an incoming ship that was headed for Kunark and needed to pick up supplies! As the ship came and pulled away I swam to it and climbed onboard, stowing myself away in the hull of the giant ship she was carrying.  It made its way across Timorous and finally started to pull in towards a nearby dock.. I quickly dove off the boat and swam to the shore.. "So this is kunark?" I thought to myself.. all I saw around me were animals and ruins of some ancient civilization.<br>
<br>
Going by the stories that my master told me, I found my way to the Lake of Ill Omen, where I joined an army that was assulting the Sarnak fort of Chancellor D'vin.  Here I trained more in the ways of team combat.</font><P>-~{ Decurro Dulcidine }~-<P><i></i></TD></TR></TABLE></TD></TR></TABLE><TABLE BORDER=0 WIDTH=95%><TR><TD ALIGN=LEFT></TD><TD ALIGN=RIGHT><A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumbiographiessharesomeinfoaboutyourself.showMessage?topicID=80.topic><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1><< Prev Topic</FONT></A> &nbsp;<A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumbiographiessharesomeinfoaboutyourself.showMessage?topicID=68.topic><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>Next Topic >></FONT></A> </TD></TR></TABLE><BR><TABLE WIDTH=95% BORDER=0><TR><TD><A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumbiographiessharesomeinfoaboutyourself.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=84.topic&index=1><IMG SRC=http://acinternet.com/lanys/addReply.gif border=0></A></TD><TD><A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumbiographiessharesomeinfoaboutyourself.emailToFriend?topicID=84.topic><IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/images/email.gif BORDER=0 ALT="Email This To a Friend"></A><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2>&nbsp;Email This To a Friend</FONT><BR><A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumbiographiessharesomeinfoaboutyourself.threadControl?topicID=84.topic><IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif BORDER=0 ALT="Topic Control Image"></A><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;Topic Commands (Moderator only)</FONT><BR><A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumbiographiessharesomeinfoaboutyourself.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=84.topic><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2>Subscribe</FONT></A>  <FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2>Click to receive email notification of replies</FONT><BR><A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumbiographiessharesomeinfoaboutyourself.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=84.topic><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2>Unsubscribe</FONT></A>  <FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2>Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</FONT><BR></TD><TD></TD></TR><TR><TD COLSPAN=3 ALIGN=CENTER><BR><FORM ACTION=http://pub4.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum METHOD=POST><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2>Jump to: </FONT><SELECT NAME=forumName><OPTION VALUE=eqasylumgeneral>General<OPTION VALUE=eqasylumfrm25>Raid Discussions<OPTION VALUE=eqasylumthetavernincharacterdiscussion>The Tavern <OPTION VALUE=eqasylumthemerchantsunionbuyselltradeorannounceyourservicesforhire>The Merchant's Union<OPTION VALUE=eqasylumbiographiessharesomeinfoaboutyourself>Biographies <OPTION VALUE=eqasylumplayerrunquestsorganizeandfindactorsfordynamicquests>Player Run Quests <OPTION VALUE=eqasylumlookingforgroupannounceplanorjoinraidsandgroups>Looking for group!!!! <OPTION VALUE=eqasylumthehallofhonour>The Hall of Honour<OPTION VALUE=eqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver>The Shit List <OPTION VALUE=eqasylumfrm24>Community Polls<OPTION VALUE=eqasylumrantsandravesbalancingissues>Rants and Raves <OPTION VALUE=eqasylumfrm30>Gone for good... maybe<OPTION VALUE=eqasylumfrm26>Guildleaders' Forum<OPTION VALUE=eqasylumfrm28>Admin Use Only<OPTION VALUE=eqasylumbard>Bard<OPTION VALUE=eqasylumcleric>Cleric<OPTION VALUE=eqasylumdruid>Druid<OPTION VALUE=eqasylumenchanter>Enchanter<OPTION VALUE=eqasylummagician>Magician<OPTION VALUE=eqasylummonk>Monk<OPTION VALUE=eqasylumnecromancer>Necromancer<OPTION VALUE=eqasylumpaladin>Paladin<OPTION VALUE=eqasylumranger>Ranger<OPTION VALUE=eqasylumrogue>Rogue<OPTION VALUE=eqasylumshadowknight>Shadowknight<OPTION VALUE=eqasylumshaman>Shaman<OPTION VALUE=eqasylumwarrior>Warrior<OPTION VALUE=eqasylumwizard>Wizard</SELECT><INPUT TYPE=SUBMIT VALUE=Go></FORM></TD></TR></TABLE><BR><CENTER><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#000033>- </FONT><A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/beqasylum><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>Lanys Community Forum</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#000033> - </FONT><A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumbiographiessharesomeinfoaboutyourself><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>Biographies </FONT></A><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#000033> - </FONT><A HREF=http://www.lanys.com><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>Lanys.com</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#000033> - </FONT></B></CENTER><font size="1" face="sans-serif">There is an alternative forum for Lanys players, called <b>Free Lanys</b>.
