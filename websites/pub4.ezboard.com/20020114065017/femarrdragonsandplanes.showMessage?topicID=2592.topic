He directs me to give korarlei a tell.  So I give him a tell and they tell me they need me and for me to bring some people.  <br>
<br>
At this point I want to know the loot rules.  I asked if we could do the king a second time so I could get my epic piece also.  He informs me there are 4 clerics.  I ask him if they all needed and were at that part of the epic.  I said I will only come if it is NBG and that meant only cleric who were at the chardok king step of their epics.  He directed to give sinangel bekki and another cleric who isn't involved a tell.  Sinangel and bekki both were at this step of their epics so I agreed with them that I would roll agains them both.  I also told korarlei that I would roll against sinangel and bekki since they were at this step but I wouldn't come unless only the 3 of us who needed it could roll and he agreed.<br>
<br>
The king falls and someone says all clerics rolling.  I said immediatly no only three of us are.  Korarlei at this point says that it is defaulted to sinangel.  and before I could respond she had looted it.  She must have been in the exp group.  I was pissed, I just got screwd.  I admittedly through a shit fit right there in chardok.  Then they tell me that I agreed to give sinangel the first and roll against bekki for the second king we were going to kill.<br>
<br>
So Koarlei gives me a tell and tells me that sinangel told him that bekki and and I both agreed that she would get teh first singed scroll default and the two of us would roll on a second one.  <br>
<br>
I give sinangel a tell and she says that bekki told her that I agreed that she could have the first one by default.  <br>
<br>
I never told anyone that, in fact I had been very specific that I wouldn't come or bring my people unless it was NBG and everyone who needed got a fair shot on any singed scroll that dropped.<br>
<br>
I give Bekki a tell and she won't even respond.  She just sat there and ignored me so I don't know what here story is.  Maybe she really is the mastermind who pulled the wool over everyones eyes, but why I don't know. She didn't get her piece either.<br>
<br>
Korarlei now claims that after sinangel told him that bekki and I agreed he gave bekki a tell to see if this was true and she said it was, but he happened to be to busy to ask me.  Although when the king was dead there was nothing there and he had all day to give me a tell.  <br>
<br>
Finaly Korarlei has the gaul to say that my guild Champions of Marr is a shitty guild and that if I ever wanted to get my epic I needed to join him and Gorndax starting their own guild.  Anyone who knows a champion knows we are kind people and a strong guild, so please don't talk about things you don't know anything about.  <br>
<br>
I don't know whether they set this up together or wether there is one master liar and a bunch of stupid leadership mistakes that got me screwed but I got screwed here.  I agreed to join an NBG raid and I ended up seeing my epic piece just given to someone before I could even call shananagins.  Oh and if you were wondering the queen slaughtered us and we had to get coffins so we didn't get a second king.<br>
<br>
Whoever lied to me and/or everyone else shame on you.  This is a game and for many of us a short break from reality and you had to ruin the fun for me and the people I brought.  What kind of person would lie in a game to screw someone.  It just doesn't make sense to me.  /shame when you look in the mirror you should despise what you see looking back at you.<br>

at this point, you should have sent a tell to all those leading, and all those who might have been remotely involved in this decision.  its not between the clerics who gets the loot, its up to the guy leading the raid.<br>

you were rightfully pissed, its natural, but whos fault was it you got skrewed (apart from Sinagle, who may or may not have known your intentions, that we dont actually know)<br>

                                  chardok.[/qu]<br>
if it was my raid, i would have discluded you on all rolls from there on out.  no questions.  also, that implies that you did it rather suddenly, giving nobody else a chance to explain.<br>
<br>
[qu] give Bekki a tell and she won't even respond. She just sat there<br>
                                  and ignored me so I don't know what here story is. Maybe she<br>

maybe you didn't explain it, or maybe since you were throwing a fit, she didn't answer, or maybe she was *gasp* afk<br>

i'm glad you threw that in, usefull.<br>
btw, i heard you said all blacks should be slaves.  that took a lot of gaul to say that (i know you didn't, just sorta driving the point of uselessness into it)<br>
<br>
[qu]Korarlei now claims that after sinangel told him that bekki and I<br>

sometimes people are to busy to answer questions when leading a raid.  just getting everyone in the same spot is hard enough, but dealing with people who whine because they didn't tell the people who were donig loot about their new, unique loot rules is not high on the "lets pay attention to it" list.<br>

Personally, if your story is true Darikan, I feel really sorry that you got dicked over by someone who lied to you. If you indeed made it as clearly as you stipulated, they were using you for your class, and they can bend over and scoop up a big glass of fuck off as far as I'm concerned.<br>

<br>
There's no maybe about it, this guy (that would be Darikan for you idiots) skrewed up, and brought this entire situation onto himself by not telling the person in charge about the large change in loot rules that Darikan made up, as well as not telling anyone else to help verify these changes.  From his post, he could have sounded like he made them up on the spot.<br>
<br>
&quot;We're all aware that there are two sides to every story.&quot;<br>
<br>
any retard who throws a hissy fit because someone else's raid didn't go they way they wanted it is obviousally not seeing the other side of the story, and someone might need to point it out to them (and to you as well, Nekiah)<br>
<br>
&quot;He was nothing but civil and clear in his post.&quot;<br>
<br>
Darikan called two people I respect liars, and added an entire paragraph that was nothing but bullshit (and probably made up, but thats a probably, doesn't mean it actually happened for you idiots out there) about the person whom he was bugging and admitadly flaming/whining about in the middle of the raid.<br>
<br>
If anyone is going to be so ungodly stupid to make mistakes like this on an epic pickup raid, including whining in the middle of said fucking raid, they dont deserve to have their epic.  <br>
<br>
One more thing Nekiah, until you've actually dealt with people like Darikan, who, just because they are a tad bit annoyed, bitch and complain because the raid leader didn't read their mind, fuck off.  I've dealt with people who demand to be ressed first, who demand to be main tank, who demand to be main healer, who demand to be main puller, *who demand to have certain loot if it drops, and who demand to be as fucking annoying as possible on a raid*.  I know what Koarli (sp) was going through, and i would have done the same exact thing.  People acting like Darikan suck for pick up raid leaders, and have caused many of *us* to quit leading them (i can name five off the top of my head, those are just the ones i've been friends with), and many more come this close to quitting.<br>
<br>
by the way,<br>
<br>
&quot;your conceited glaring tone is often reserved for flames&quot;<br>
<br>
not only was my post rather mild for this person, but yours was definatley a flame, so dont waste my time whining about my &quot;conceited glaring tone&quot; when i respond to your random acts of PMS initiated, spastic attacks like i did above.<br>
<br>
and believe me, my earlier post on this wasn't a flame, for those of you who need it pointed out.<br>
<br>
I wasn't even there, so i dont know the other side of the story, i'm just going off what Darikan posted, but thats just about enough to go from for me.<br>

Please show me exactly where he said he demanded loot.  From what I see, he wanted a fair shot at the loot, which in my mind is perfectly fair considering he was ASKED to join because they were short on clerics.  <br>
<br>
Another brilliant post proving you dont know how to read is<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> There's no maybe about it, this guy (that would be Darikan for you idiots) skrewed up, and brought this entire situation onto himself by not telling the person in charge about the large change in loot rules that Darikan made up, <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
If you had actually read the post, Darikan says<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Sinangel and bekki both were at this step of their epics so I agreed with them that I would roll agains them both...Korarlei at this point says that it is defaulted to sinangel<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
This, at least it seems, shows that he DID talk to the other clerics, and also that Korarlei was the loot master.<br>
<br>
<br>
And if what you said about the Champions of Marr is true Korarlei, screw you.  CoM has been around for over 2 years, I have been a part for a year and a half.  Gorndax was a member for quite a while as well, and is a good friend of mine as well, he helped me out quite a bit and I appreciate it.  <br>
<br>
Parum, maybe you are right and there is a completly different side of the story.  But think about it, he was asked to join a raid, asked about the loot, was told he could have a fair shot at it and then was screwed out of his chance.  So tell me, what should he have done exactly?  He should have gone, gotten screwed out of a chance at an item and just sat there?  In other words, he wasted time and experience helping someone he didn't know and getting lied to.  <br>

<br>
Secondly, the idea of you calling my little distraction a flame is...well, wrong. It wasn't even in the specific direction of heat. We're coasting on ice crystals so far, and you'll know when we get to even a spark.<br>
<br>
Now, on to the spanking. <br>
<br>
--There's no maybe about it, this guy (that would be Darikan for you idiots) skrewed up, and brought this entire situation onto himself by not telling the person in charge about the large change in loot rules that Darikan made up,--<br>
<br>
That would definately be a maybe. Next time your rummaging through your mothers Sears catalogue, looking for happy hour jerk off material, take the time to go through that dictionary you never look at. It's called an opinion, and unlike your mother told you as you were growing up, you aren't the center of the universe. It doesn't matter if you decide it's his fault. Were you even there? <br>
<br>
--as well as not telling anyone else to help verify these changes. From his post, he could have sounded like he made them up on the spot.--<br>
<br>
Thanks for blatant, totally made up conjecture. Don't be stupid. It's obvious your overzealous to protect the nature of your dragon pharming friends, but there's no need for assisination of character.<br>
<br>
--any retard who throws a hissy fit because someone else's raid didn't go they way they wanted it is obviousally not seeing the other side of the story, and someone might need to point it out to them--<br>
<br>
I'd be pretty damned pissed if I joined a raid, after explaining time and time again my conditions on my presence (not to mention his friends) only to find out my reasons were thrown out the window, and they used me for my classes abilities. It wouldn't have even happened without him being there, and then he got fucked royally, despite his clarity on the situation. Yeah, that sounds fair. You're right, he should have just shut his mouth and ask them to use lube next time.<br>
<br>
--If anyone is going to be so ungodly stupid to make mistakes like this on an epic pickup raid, including whining in the middle of said fucking raid, they dont deserve to have their epic. --<br>
<br>
Thank you, Mr. Everquest police. I'm sure Darikan really cares about your opinion, not to mention the cheering masses I hear in the background. ...wait, no, that last part was made up, not unlike most of your logic.<br>
<br>
--One more thing Nekiah, until you've actually dealt with people like Darikan, who, just because they are a tad bit annoyed, bitch and complain because the raid leader didn't read their mind, fuck off. --<br>
<br>
Not to sound like Chukzombi, however; I've been leading raids since before you knew Everquest existed. As proud as I am of all the times you've farmed Lord nagafen and Vox, it doesn't matter. This isn't the special olympics, and everyone doesn't get a medal. <br>
<br>
I've dealt with plenty of annoying people, and I comprehend the difference between an irate person who felt they've been wronged, and a selfish bastard, out to suit number one. What you don't grasp is that your friends don't entail the entire stratosphere. Just because they feel one way, it doesn't make it right. And, judging by your grasp of logic, if they're anything like you, it's probably wrong.<br>
<br>
--not only was my post rather mild for this person, but yours was definatley a flame, so dont waste my time whining about my &quot;conceited glaring tone&quot; when i respond to your random acts of PMS initiated, spastic attacks like i did above.--<br>
<br>
I wasn't talking about the acidity of your speech. I meant your overglaring protectiveness, since you felt he wronged his friends. It wasn't WWII, and he didn't even cuss them, except with the article concerning calling his guild &quot;shitty&quot;. We all know you're there for them, you can take the collar off now.<br>
<br>
--I wasn't even there, so i dont know the other side of the story, i'm just going off what Darikan posted, but thats just about enough to go from for me.--<br>
<br>
Exactly. Which is why he didn't deserve such vehemence in the first place. You're as clueless as everybody else, and until you understand that your opinion isn't worth a damn thing without first hand information, it's best not to attack anyone. <br>
<br>
Anyway, your entire argument is bunk anyway, if we assume one thing he said was true.<br>
<br>
(1) &quot;I also told korarlei that I would roll against sinangel and bekki since they were at this step but I wouldn't come unless only the 3 of us who needed it could roll and he agreed.&quot;<br>
<br>
followed by...<br>
<br>
(2) &quot;Korarlei at this point says that it is defaulted to sinangel. and before I could respond she had looted it,&quot;<br>
<br>
So, in conclusion, it was obvious there was a hyjinx, and honesty was a precious commodity. I'd review the actions of my friends with a little more scrunity, personally.<br>

I never directly called anyone a liar, but the fact of the matter is at least one person is lying.  I made it very very clear beforehand to KORARLEI the RAID LEADER that I wouldn't come and RECRUIT FOR HIM people unless it was NBG for clerics at THIS STEP of their epics.  A FAIR shot for EVERYONE. KORARLEI is the one who told me to discuss it with the other three clerics and we were all in agreement that it would be a roll between the three of us as the forth cleric bowed out because he wasn't to this step.  I told the RAID LEADER KORARLIE that we were in agreement that was NBG roll and that is the only way I would come and recruit.  So he knew and yes once again that is the RAID LEADER.  He agreed that it would be NBG because otherwise I wouldn't come and bring my people with me.  now if this is sinangels raid that she planned and organized then of course it would default to her no questions asked but this was a pickup raid with predefined NBG loot rules.  Tell me under a pickup raid of EPIC proportions are you going to go just to get something that you need for someone you don't know.  If you say yes your lying.   If sinangel give me a tell I am organizing a raid for my epic I need help we will try to hit the king again for the other clerics then probably.  Or even I just need your help for my epic.  I would go.  People have come help me with no benifit to themselves.  But this was a pickup raid with equal oppertunity for everyone.  I made sure before I even left EK where I was getting silk for my tailoring that everyone clerics and the RAID LEADER knew that I was only interested incoming if it was NBG.  We were all in agreement.  I am not saying sinangel lied that bekki told her I would default.  I am not saying korarlei lied that sinangel told him that bekki and I agreed based on bekki telling her.  I am saying that one of those three is lying though.  I am also saying that as specific as I was about not coming unless those were the rules that they should have had the sense to ask me if that was really true.  I have done pickup raids myself.  I have done them in PoH and I know what a pain in the ass it is to be the leader.  But I also take responsibilty when I screw up.  If I make a mistake and I cost someone something I will see to it that it gets fixed or they get compensated.  But that is what a good leader does.  Not someone like you who has narrow vision and can only see what you want to see.<br>

<br>
Baaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaad form Parum, why not say &quot;I'd just kick the guy out from the raid and chance ruining the whole thing for everyone.&quot;  ESPECIALLY if it's an essential class (cleric, enchanter, super tank, evac) you need in the middle of one of your big raids.  You're going to screw yourself over more than you screw the class.  Sometimes you can't always find replacements, and if you can it can take forever to set things up.  So you really should think twice before you say or do stuff like this or your raids will, well... die.  But hey, I'm not a raid leader person, nor do I really plan to be (probably why I don't have any of my epics) so what the hell do I know?<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;btw, i heard you said all blacks should be slaves. that took a lot of gaul to say that (i know you didn't, just sorta driving the point of uselessness into it)<br>
<br>
You also heard that I was ebayed and tried KSing and farming the Frenzied spawn all by myself a long time ago in Lower Guk.  Where the hell do you hear your information, Parum?  And no, I don't think Darikan would really say something like this, but he does have a lot to do with arses.  You had better freshen up your hearing, friend, or a lot of these people's friends who've known them for quite a long time will start hunting you down.  I know when you called me an ebayed player I got a ton of the people I knew back from level 7 in North Ro to send you and the other guy some tells telling you to back the hell away.<br>
