No where in my post did I say the filing of false charges does not happen.  While yes, I do believe there are people out there (note, men and women) that will file harassment charges at the drop of a pin, I believe them to be in the minority.<br>
<br>
Ignoring someone is not against the law, until that person feels singled out by your action, then it becomes an issue of creating a hostile work environment (which easily leads to the very broad discrimination complaint) and is just as chargeable as harrassment.<br>
<br>
Quick question though, how does your example of the male employee filing harassment in an obviously justified case support your arguement about false charges?  I do not see the relevance between a justified (though disagreeable outcome) charge and some woman falsely stating you made a comment about thier bust size.  How does this support your claim that you need to openly ignore all the women in your wokplace or risk thier temper?  <br>
<br>

I'm not sure if you were talking to me about the flaming thing, but I'll be the first to admit I suck at flaming, I'll leave that to the pros like Vendrix and Dwarkarn.  <br>
<br>
Women do not win all the time, I have seen several cases thrown out of the court due to being unfounded.  <br>
<br>
Choosing not to put yourself in a situation that can come back negatively on you is great, and exactly what you have to do, however, I think Chiteng's approach to women in the workplace opens him up for the same headache he is trying to avoid.  Same problem different door if you will...<br>

Talk about about writing and saying absolutely nothing. Where's the substance Chiteng? You write in the vain attempt to portray yourself as some omnipotent philosopher who has transcended the vagaries of the human condition, but all you've managed to show is that you proven nothing to one and eaten bandwith to do so. <br>
<br>
Let me clue you in about a movie. It isn't real!! Wow, what a novel concept. The sooner you figure out that we all die in end the sooner you'll realize that nothing good or bad matters. Who cares if you had millions screwed some hot chick when your dead? Similarly who cares how someone is portrayed on a movie screen. Either you're attracted to Kirsten Dunst or the ideal of her charcter or you're not. I just understand why you feel the need to project your own social inadequacies onto a movie character.<br>
<br>
Either you can do something about it or you can wallow and feel guilty or upset or whatever the hell it is you do. Any a-hole can complain but what are you going to do about it.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uneebbo.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Neebbo</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 83<br> <font color=#E9D756>(5/8/02 1:23:27 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3325.topic&index=106>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Spiderman and Reality - The fuze is lit</span><hr size=1>   I'm not currently inclined to comment further. I'm just going to post a slightly on topic lyric:<br>
<br>
When the earth was still flat,<br>
And the clouds made of fire,<br>
And mountains stretched up to the sky,<br>
Sometimes higher,<br>
Folks roamed the earth<br>
Like big rolling kegs.<br>
They had two sets of arms.<br>
They had two sets of legs.<br>
They had two faces peering<br>
Out of one giant head<br>
So they could watch all around them<br>
As they talked; while they read.<br>
And they never knew nothing of love.<br>
It was before the origin of love.<br>
<br>
The origin of love<br>
<br>
And there were three sexes then,<br>
One that looked like two men<br>
Glued up back to back,<br>
Called the children of the sun.<br>
And similar in shape and girth<br>
Were the children of the earth.<br>
They looked like two girls<br>
Rolled up in one.<br>
And the children of the moon<br>
Were like a fork shoved on a spoon.<br>
They were part sun, part earth<br>
Part daughter, part son.<br>
<br>
The origin of love<br>
<br>
Now the gods grew quite scared<br>
Of our strength and defiance<br>
And Thor said,<br>
&quot;I'm gonna kill them all<br>
With my hammer,<br>
Like I killed the giants.&quot;<br>
And Zeus said, &quot;No,<br>
You better let me<br>
Use my lightning, like scissors,<br>
Like I cut the legs off the whales<br>
And dinosaurs into lizards.&quot;<br>
Then he grabbed up some bolts<br>
And he let out a laugh,<br>
Said, &quot;I'll split them right down the middle.<br>
Gonna cut them right up in half.&quot;<br>
And then storm clouds gathered above<br>
Into great balls of fire<br>
<br>
And then fire shot down<br>
From the sky in bolts<br>
Like shining blades<br>
Of a knife.<br>
And it ripped<br>
Right through the flesh<br>
Of the children of the sun<br>
And the moon<br>
And the earth.<br>
And some Indian god<br>
Sewed the wound up into a hole,<br>
Pulled it round to our belly<br>
To remind us of the price we pay.<br>
And Osiris and the gods of the Nile<br>
Gathered up a big storm<br>
To blow a hurricane,<br>
To scatter us away,<br>
In a flood of wind and rain,<br>
And a sea of tidal waves,<br>
To wash us all away,<br>
And if we don't behave<br>
They'll cut us down again<br>
And we'll be hopping round on one foot<br>
And looking through one eye.<br>
<br>
Last time I saw you<br>
We had just split in two.<br>
You were looking at me.<br>
I was looking at you.<br>
You had a way so familiar,<br>
But I could not recognize,<br>
Cause you had blood on your face;<br>
I had blood in my eyes.<br>
But I could swear by your expression<br>
That the pain down in your soul<br>
Was the same as the one down in mine. <br>
That's the pain,<br>
Cuts a straight line<br>
Down through the heart;<br>
We called it love.<br>
So we wrapped our arms around each other,<br>
Trying to shove ourselves back together.<br>
We were making love,<br>
Making love.<br>
It was a cold dark evening,<br>
Such a long time ago,<br>
When by the mighty hand of Jove,<br>
It was the sad story<br>
How we became<br>
Lonely two-legged creatures,<br>
It's the story of<br>
The origin of love.<br>
That's the origin of love.<br>

<br>
I can never understand the whole gender stereotype thing  because what one sex is accused of doing is just as often done by the other sex.  Take the previously mentioned bar scene.  A woman and man meet in a bar.  They decide to hook up and do a &quot;one night stand&quot; without even knowing each other's names.  However, when most people look at this situation, they think &quot;Wow, the girl's a slut&quot;  Does anyone mention the man's involvement?  Rarely, but he is just as &quot;guilty&quot; as she is.  Both sexes (and I've had extensive conversations about this with male friends so I know that this happens to them as well) have blinders where the opposite sex is concerned.  Sometimes this means they put the object of their affection up on a pedistal and refuse to see the faults as they lie.  This happens in movies, and it happens in real life.

I had thought the thread was dead. But.....<br>
<br>
In the aforemention analogy about one night stands. I strongly suspect, that<br>
unless someone 'HAD AN INTEREST' in the male, that they would NOT give any thought to his behavior at all. I mean why bother? Now his WIFE might, or his girlfreinds might, or possibly his male lover might, but WHY would anyone else? The answer is that they would NOT.<br>
<br>
However, the underlying assumption about the 'female' in question, is that she is<br>
worthy of notice. If she isnt, then no one cares what she does. Its that simple.<br>
<br>
That means that the defining characteristic would be that she was noticed, for whatever reason. Now that USUALLY means that she is attractive, usually<br>
SEXUALLY attractive. Now a man may have any number of reason to notice a woman, this is by far the most common.<br>
<br>
In that narrow paradigm then: UNLESS the observing male happens to be the male<br>
she chooses to hook up with, then the observing male will in all likelyhood wonder<br>
why she didnt choose HIM. That can create a situation where the unlucky male<br>
may have any number of lables he may wish to apply to the woman.<br>
<br>
BUT, I tell you what, WOMEN are FAR more NASTY and MEAN at calling other women names than any men I have ever met. I will give you an example that is<br>
quite true. It is a mystery to me but I suspect any woman reading this would be able to explain it.<br>
<br>
One day in 1988 I was at work. One of my co-workers (female married w children)<br>
came to work in early April wearing a white leather mini-skirt and matching blouse and shoes.<br>
Most of the males in her vicinity did notice, and then when back to work.<br>
In early April in North Dakota, it is NOT common for women to wear skirts period.<br>
<br>
The comments I overheard from the OTHER women in the office were scathing!<br>
One of the nicest was 'She looks like a GO-GO dancer'. They were downright mean<br>
about it. Considering that they were all mostly married and with children<br>
why did they care? To this day it makes NO SENCE.<br>
<br>
The next day, od course, at least 7 women were wearing mini-skirts.<br>
Can someone explain this dynamic? I really DONT get it.<br>
<br>
If it is competition, for male attention, WHAT IS THE POINT????<br>
Even if they GET the attention they are all married!!! They wont do anything<br>
anyway!<br>
<br>
From my point of view, they are merely teasing the males to get ego-boosts.<br>
That is sick. But I am sure that MY way of looking at it, isnt the ONLY way.<br>
So I await the learned, to explain to this poor shmoe.<br>

Your lack of understanding of the miniskirt episode is common though.<br>
<br>
Let me put it in a male perspective.<br>
<br>
A guy at work comes in and talks about the weekend he had.<br>
<br>
The women he had on his arm, how she was into him, blah blah blah.<br>
<br>
The other guys listen and laugh in all the right spots. Later one sends another an E mail. &quot;You, think that really happened?&quot; the other replies &quot;Nah he is full of @#%$.&quot;<br>
<br>
Of course the next day one of the guys will have something concocted to one up the first in small manner. (Probably a sports thing or car related, or maybe the other fellow is a dallas fan and the redskins beat them last night (A dream I know it hasnt happened in a while))<br>
<br>
Same damn thing. Woman can be more vicious in thier pecking order because the pecking order changes all the time. Men tend to establish the order early then destroy it from withen while still maintaining that pecking order.<br>
<br>
Or we could refer to the other post I made and just say you are a @#%$ Loon.<br>
<br>
And of course after the little story I made up I nor anyone else really knows how woman work, and even if we did we would forget it so we have something to gripe about. Just laugh take your pills and hope that the spinning stops before you get in front of the keyboard again.<br>
<br>
<br>
Women like to look good. They like to be looked at and admired. (But not leered at or objectified) Women like to know that they still have it. (Power through attractiveness)<br>
<br>
Or as a wise man once said. &quot;Sometimes you just have to Strut.&quot;<br>
<br>
Who was that wise man.?<br>

<br>
Why bother if you dont intend to follow thru? These women were all married<br>
mostly, the one that were not married were terrified of AIDS.<br>
<br>
I speak only for me, when I say, to get attention for no purpose, sounds like a waste of time. <br>
<br>
Let me try a diffrent perspective:<br>
<br>
Would you tease a starving dog with a steak? NO? Why not? Because it is cruel?<br>
BUT it isnt cruel to tease a male with sexuality? You see 'I' really dont see the difference. Not at all. Yet it happens all the time. From high-school to the end.<br>
<br>
I agree women DO get our attention, to deny that would deny reality. I just dont understand WHY they do it. <p>“It is clear that the individual who persecutes a man, his brother, because he is not of the same opinion, is a monster.”

A more acceptable option 'I would assume'? Obviously I am wrong, but that is where logic takes me.<br>

In the same vein, the Catholic Church has tended to consider the only purpose to sex is children. Obviously, lots of people disagree with that idea, both inside and outside the Catholic religion. Therefore, I hope you can agree now that there is more than one reason to attract the attention of others.<br>
<br>
  For a more stereotypically male version, why would any male go to a strip club when they are unable to complete the mating ritual? Well, some women like to feel good by attracting attention, and some women get excited by the attention and take it home to hubbies. That or they find a nice broom closet. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uchiteng.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Chiteng</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 967<br> <font color=#E9D756>(5/17/02 9:59:50 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3325.topic&index=120>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Neebo</span><hr size=1> Of course your correct, but WHY do they want the attention????<br>
If they dont intend to have sex WHAT GOOD IS IT TO THEM?<br>
What is the point?<br>
<br>
The idea of 'ego-gratification' translates into 'tease' if they have no purpose.<br>
Unless of course I have missed some dynamic in the behavior. Which is easily possible of course. If I understood the behavior, then I would not be posting.<br>
