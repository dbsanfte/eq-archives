You have my utmost respect in reguards to in game guild morals etc.  But aside from all that, I had a couple of questions. One, is just abit of news.  I will be reinstating the guild I once lead under a different character. Dark Phoenix, a racially pure guild on the dark team guided by my secondary char Disianus Al'azure.  Although in the past, we were more primarily bent on RP over PvP, I've been thinking on attempting to bend it in the PvP direction this time to give you guys somthing to go up against that ya know in the ooc respects you.  Of course, its all blood and hate in game though;)  Anyways, I'm forced to bring my guild out of hybernation since Verant is bringing the axe to any guilds with less than 10 members.  Anywhich way, though the guild was originally built on the alliance of 3 guilds that folded, I will most likely be restructuring it to fit a smaller membership of mostly people I have either played with for around a year, or know in RL so I am sure of the character of the people behind the characters ;) so to speak.   So on that note, just wanted to let you know if you see the Dark Phoenix tag displayed attack on sight.. for our members will fight fair as far as OOC stuff goes, and with pure hate in char (of course).  Not sure how the shanks have been leveling, but our members will mostly be mid teens/twenties/low thirties.  so if anyone cares to set up 'player quests' via missions, ambushes, field battles.. drop me a line via my email.<br>
...Also, another thing.  I recently had a bout with one of the guild memembers of "Global Menance".. well, a couple of them.  One was completely rude and childish OOC to me, but then later, when I sought my vengance for his slight in game against another of his guild.. we (the second guy, whom I killed) ended up in a length conversation ooc, that was quiet polite.  He apologized for the other members behavoir, and went on to say that there guild was atually purist like the Shanks, and even had alliance with thee.  I'm just curious to confirm this, so I know to add there guild to my list of PvP enemies worth bothering with/showing ooc respect to.<br>
--well, if any of this is confusing, contribute it to lack of sleep and working 11 hours 3rd shift ;)  thanks for having me in, I'll stop by to see the reaction.  Not all of my chars are pure evil, although.. the Dark Phoenix for all purposes will be ;)<br>

Savia,<br>
<br>
We welcome the challenge and the fun of new PvP/RP dark guild.  I don't beleive that any of us in the Shanks like the "Quake" type of PvP, where any and all methods are used to defeat another, then insult them /ooc afterwards.  Neither, do we whine, when we've been beaten.<br>
<br>
We have an alliance with any Guild that is human team only, 4v4 team PvP, and follows the same rules of conduct that we do.  The Global Menace, has done so on every occasion that we have fought together.<br>
<br>
Some of the GM do have a tendancy to "smack talk" /ooc a bit.  Usually I've seen this in response to another's antogonistic /ooc remarks.  Most though are honorable characters and suffer only from the bad rep given to them by the same characters that try to give it to us.<br>
<br>
Good luck with the guild restructuring.  I look forward to seeing you before you see me soon. ;) <p>Majestyk, <a href="http://Server3.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse">Rogue</a>, Leader, <a href="http://galaxy.apropos.org/shanks">Shanks</a>, <a href="http://vnboards.ign.com/board.asp?brd=5034">Vallon Zek!</a>

I believe It was me that you talked to in the lenghty OOC conversation. I remember you killing me as I was &quot;sleeping&quot; on the hill in Misty.<br>
<br>
Heh, was a good converstaion, I thought, and am glad that you viewed me as polite. I try. Anyway, just thought I'd say &quot; Hello &quot; to you here, since I frequent this local.<br>

Until next time we meet. Take care, and safe travels.<br>

well, I had begun working on reforging Dark Phoenix but never finished. about mid way through revamping the message board ect, I started talking with an old guild ally from House V'Umbra and decided on a different course of action.  I joined my primary to there house as officer in her position, and represenative of a guild alliance (in char). OOC, we just merged basically.  I brought in all my 'agents' that I had dispersed through various guilds, and decided it would be easier to let another hold full leadership so I can work on my own projects so to speak.  <br>
--House V'Umbra is roleplay only, and dark team only as well, so if you encounter them you can expect a good enemy to fight against.  Although, the guild is hardly PvP oriented.  Over time I will attempt to push for more PvP though, perhaps down the road we can ooc set up some kind of guild vs guild zone war.  I think that would be a blast :)  I love fighting against someone I know doesent take it personally out of char.  At one point, I thought about making a guild where it was both light and dark team, but where both sides warred with each other constantly.  RHT already does that though, so thats not much of a new idea at this point.  ok, well I gotta run, take care all ye shankers;) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uceescrit.showPublicProfile?language=EN>ceescrit</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered Patron</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(10/2/00 8:58:49 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ftheshanksgeneraldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=313.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Hi'ya again, been awhile since I checked up </span><hr size=1> &lt;Stumbles into a barbarian infested Mead hall&gt;<br>
