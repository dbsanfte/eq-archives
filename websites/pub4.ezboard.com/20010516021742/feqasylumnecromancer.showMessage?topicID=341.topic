I know for sure you can by lvl 54.<br>
<br>
BTW, if you pull to the front, you can do partial fear kites just great.  Also, if you get into trouble just fear the mob...they run past the zone line a little ways and just stand there.  When fear breaks they will come running back, but it buys you some time.  If you dont care about loot you can just fear/dot np.<br>

<br>
I found out that I can single pull (L51), I also found out the following.<br>
<br>
If you pull from the court yard and fear, with the pet beating on it, and one dot, they either die before they get to the entrance, or fear breaks half way there.  The beauty is that there are no roamers or other mobs between the Courtyard and the exit.  <br>
<br>
When Darkness wore off, I'd call the pet off, and go back up top, wait for fear to wear off and reingage when it came after me.  I would never let my pet follow it to the entrance because the 2 guards upfront, though green, were super buffed in HPs latelty, so they would just be a waste of mana and time.<br>
<br>
I got some decent xp and made some melees really happy when guardian armor droped.  Loot was mostly Velium blocks and pieces, which I use to make the thurgadin gate potions, coins and the ocasional armor piece.<br>
<br>
I was able to solo the entire courtyard, though at times I never made it to the Sentries in the back...just ran out of time and mana.  The re-pop rate is about 20-30 min and I suggest you pay close attention to this.  You definatelly don't want the Gargoyle guards at the entrance of the Court Yard pop on you mid pull.<br>
<br>
I had a total of 4 deaths there.  2 were LD deaths (grrr.../rude Verant) one was just bad luck (lots of resists on the drakes), and the last one was me getting overly confident.  After I cleared the courtyard, I decided to pull some sentries from past the courtyard.  at L51 I was not able to single pull these, they resisted quite a bit and I swear it felt like they had SoW on them.  They were on top of me like there was no tomorrow.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I made like 2blue bubs in the time I was there, so the xp was ok, but not amazing, it was chalenging and I had a blast.<br>
<br>
Let me know if you have any questions about this place in relation to soloing it.  <br>
<br>
PS: there is another place that has guardians and sentries, 80% of which were blue to me, hunted there for a bit too, but casting was a bit of a challenge due to the fact that their pathing took them on lots of stairs.<br>
<br>
I did find something interesting out.  You can begin to cast a spell while the mob is outside of your field of vision, as long as by the time you complete your casting, they are within your view.  The spell casting completes and takes hold.  I never knew this until this weekend (after numerous timing trials at casting on stairs)<br>

it is part of the shawl quest in Thurgadin.  the best part is that the potion can be made in of itself without any need of the rest of the quests.<br>

You say, 'what velium vapors' <br>
<br>
Frundle Frenkler says 'Ahh, you come seeking my family recipe? After all you've done for our people it's the least I can do. First you must fashion a velium vial, then combine the vial with two small pieces of velium in this jar. That's all there is to it. Please keep the recipe a secret. <br>
<br>
You say, 'what velium vial?' <br>
<br>
Frundle Frenkler says 'I'm no potter mind you, but if I remember correctly it's a small brick of velium, three crystalline silks, and two glass shards. Then you'll have to finish up by firing it in a kiln with a high quality firing sheet. <br>
<br>
Small piece of velium and small block of velium can be looted on Ry’Gorr Minors in Crystal Caverns <br>
<br>
Crystalline Silk can be found on spiders in the same zone. So basically, Up to here, it’s rather easy. <br>
<br>
1) Combine a small (7 lb) brick of velium, three unstacked crystalline silks and two glass shards in a pottery wheel. You will receive an Unfired Velium Vial. <br>
2) Combine the Unfired Velium Vial and a HQ firing sheet in the kiln and receive a Veluim Vial (yes they misspelled it). <br>
3) Combine the Veluim Vial and two unstacked small pieces of Velium in the Velium purifier. The Velium Purifier disappears and you are left with a Vial of Velium Vapors. The vial has one charge of gate to Thurgadin. I don't know if it can be used for that. <br>
<br>
The vial is trivial at skill 130. <br>
<br>
<br>
I got my pottery skill up to 110 in a couple of hours and less than 40pp <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :evil --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/devil.gif ALT=":evil"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
the potion is a Lore - No Drop Item.  However the Veluim Vials are not Lore just No Drop, so you can make a slew of these and just have them ready to be combined in the purifier.<br>

<br>
Anyway, this was my first time in Skyshrine so my guild just go together a small group and decided to try and get Cobalt Scar keys...although later on the goal was to get some more phat armor.  Anyway first we pulled the gate guards to Wakening...but those guards were always green, hit too hard and had a buttload of hitpoints and never dropped anything (sip a sentry bracer once) so we moved into the Erepod (sp?) room and pulled to there, only problem with this room is you NEED a group to hold it, Erepod is an enchanter and likes to charm...ALOT, and there's another guardian in there who was blue at 51, hit for around 93, so soloing that room is sucide.  There's also a roaming guardian that goes in and out of that room, he's about 45 and his name is Guardian Sil...something or other, our group called him 117 (heh) mainly cuz that's what he hit for, meaaaaaaan mofo, but pays off, that guy alone made the trip to Skyshrine worth it, most of the armor we got came off him, we got an entire suit of guardian armor (minus boots and vambs) camping there for about 5 hours...ohh and a guardian robe (which is now mine <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   )<br>
<br>
You can safely pull other sentries and guardians to that room, spawn time is about 30 minutes for the room and 20-25 for 117, but so far I hear we either got really lucky or found out a good place to camp for Guardian armor.  One thing I need to know though is if there's a place with more Sentries?  That room seemed to be mostly Guardians near it and only dropped Guardian armor naturally, I wanted a Sentry robe to begin with so I'm still gonna go back there one day this week to try and get one, just wanted to know if anyone had any ideas on where if any, more Sentry armor seems to drop.  <br>
<br>
Anyway, good luck, that Guardian armor is phat melee gear <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  </font><P><img SRC="http://user.netomia.com/dammned1/sig2.jpg"></br>

you are more than welcome.<br>
<br>
I know of the area you are talking about....That guardian Silsomethingorother...is one mean son of a beatch.  I do believe he is the one that roams around.  usually I fear the bastard, follow him to the hall that leads to the exit, call my pet off, go back to his spawn point and wait for fear to wear off.  If Darkness wears off, I FD (this puts me on the bottom of the agro list) and he engages my pet giving me time to reaply darkness and fear.  After 2 times of this yo-yo kiting, he ends up dying...and yes, I have found the armor drops to be much better and more freequent up there.<br>
<br>
I hope to be back there later this week.  Let me know if you want to duo.  we can clear that top part easily.<br>
