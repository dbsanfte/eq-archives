Lets say, with an attitude like that, no wonder the ex-friend of his wont give him back his crap. You have to wonder about the reason he was booted from his guild as well. In any case, this is amusing.<br>

So it seems the timing on those 2 points make it less of a rant, and more of a SL<br>
<br>
Soo, they were sold without asking...  In my eyes stolen.  I have a real problem with the attitude, but then again, he is getting ripped about grammar and not the issue.  <br>
<br>
If I had a post to put up here, I would hope it was the topic of the post that was considered and not the grammar.  I would also think (knowing me) that I would probably not use paragraphs too well myself and I spell horribly (ty for the button at the bottom ... hehe), but this will hopefully not be my downfall if I ever post here <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    <br>
<br>
Now, Part of the issue may be the part that I consider theft to this point.  If the items were lent to him and sold without asking,  like giving a friend and item to twink him a bit and he sells it to get other things or money, then I definitely agree to it being a theft.  On the other hand,  If I lent them to someone, had a falling out with them and never got them back... I would consider it a loss.  Either way I would be pissed...  but in the latter, I would never consider posting here.<br>
<br>
In my case..  a little less than 2cp but hey it's me<br>

Even the translation above held errors.  Originally, it was stated that the friend who was supposed to have been given the items in question, invited him to come and inspect him, or maybe since they know each other in RL to come check his account.   But the translator seemed to have missed this and atributed those actions to Amankudo.<br>
<br>
Small error?  Sure but how many other people, because of spelling errors, bad grammar and lack of punctuation misread the original post as well?   And grammar is not for the elite, it is simply to give us a way of talking about or own language, ungangly and annoying as it is, so that we can make sense of it.   One thought = one sentence.  One group of thoughts = one paragraph.  It doesn't have to get any more complictated than that.<br>
<br>
As for the incident at hand, how does one log on and find them selves not in a guild?  Was the entire guild disbanded, or was he removed while not on-line?<br>
<br>
And as for theft, well how do you steal in EQ?  I've heard that several times, and welll.......they have a point, but borrowing and then not returning or sellimg items is low, either way.<br>

Well it all started with me and Quilthalis, we've been planning on making a guild sometime now, so we did the chatroom thing, got our 10 peeps, and waited for it to be revised. It orgionally was going to be named Aeternus Animus but they diden't except it. Which meant Eternal Spirit in Latin. So we had to choose a new name. Scrildo was a real good friend of mine ( at the time ) and I took his suggestions on a name. He asked some people he knew and came up with " Magnus Collegium ". Of course later was found out that it was spelled wrong. Gm's pointed this out it was actually Conlegium. But anyways, so we decided on Magnus Conleigium.<br>
<br>
Finally after a long period of waiting. We had a list of the 10 peeps who were going to join and Scrildo was on he called about 3 peeps over. Also, another person who planned on joining Named Heeby Jeebys he gatherd the rest of the people he we needed and waited around 45 minutes for the Gm. Finally she showed up, But we asked if we could change the guild name at the last minute. Grannus came up with Primus Magnus  * Lead Guild * in Latin so we made it from there forth.<br>
<br>
   I was talking to Quilthalis, and i mentioned something about him being Co-leader, and im preety sure i Wrong Telled it to Scrildo but diden't notice it at first. So later on he said something about himself being Co-leader and I reply'd Quilthalis and me created guild from scratch and forth and this is strictly a 50+ guild ( Even though im 46 myself but i decided to make myself a consideration )  but scrildo on the other hand was level 29 and was his main  character but had level 50ish items that always confused me. I told him Quilthalis was going to be Co-leader and thats that. He continued in guild chat pushing people around and trying to control it saying he was " Co-leader " so everyone got so Annoyed with his well bitching that i just removed him. <br>
<br>
  Later on i guess he got hold of himself so i reinvited him. I had started a rogue named Rildoh and he lent 2 items to him. 1 was Iksar Cerimonial Breastplate-2 was some Ice Shard dagger or somethin. The next day after I reinvited him in guild he asked me to return my stuff from the rogue. He was in EC and so was my rogue because i just finished up the Burning Rapier quest and was headed back from South Ro. So i signed on my rogue and Handed him the Tunic and the Dagger. He was generous and gave me a Ry'gorr Tunic to keep because i had not had another tunic to wear. <br>
<br>
   So i got back on Amankudo. About 15 min Later i get a few tells from some Guildies names i shall not mention that basically, and generally said " I heard what you did to Scrildo, just down right mean, yadda yadda. " So I was utterly confused on the matters hand. <br>
<br>
  I asked around and one of the guildies said he said I had stolen some items from him an sold them for 8k for my own wealth. This was Entirely untrue. I told some guildies to even petition to have Gm's see if i even had 8k on my account. But after that the ones who had left ignored me. So i asked Scrildo why he did it. And he replyed: /srugh. So why he did it? It shall always remain a Paradox to me. But this was entirely untrue, i have never stolen an item in my EQ Career. <br>
<br>
<br>
   If you have any questions just ask and I can answer... Also later scrildo said hes quitting EQ and can't handle the BS. Im not sure if this is true or not but i think he might have left for DAoC but i could be wrong. Anyways here is what actually happened. Thanks.<br>
<br>
<br>
P.S. Sorry for not making seperate paragraphs. And... I am not bryrs or whatever. He also threatend to say that even tho he knew i wasen't i had a Screenie to. Ill try to find it. Also no one lost any other items from guild. <p><img src=http://amankudo.freeservers.com/images/amankudosigger.gif></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uamankudobombadeer.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Amankudo Bombadeer</A> at: 11/25/01 8:55:18 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/umiramicha.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Miramicha</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.student.nada.kth.se/~md96-jma/eq/canada.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I live here.... get out.</span><br> <font color=#000033>(11/26/01 12:23:52 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: RE:Amankudo--Once a friend, Now a liar and a theif</span><hr size=1> I could mention something about the bad spelling, but I will leave that be. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Well I hadn't seen or heard from you in a while ( been on an eq strike hehehe). Well I have known the pearson behind Amankudo longer than most people would even think of playing EQ.<br>
<br>
I must say that I find it VERY unlikely that he would steal over 8k in gear seeing how he knows that my monk has much nicer items that he could use if needed. <br>
<br>
Point of fact he has used some of my things over the course of a year from time to time. Some of them of a considerable value range. He returned them to me when he was done or even when I requested them. In fact I recall about 4 months ago me and him had a fight ( I started it BTW but we all know I am a meanie) at the time he had my SotDB. I managed to piss him off and he gave it back when I was demanding it ( not asking).<br>
<br>
Me and him have probably been through quite a few rides in EQ some good some bad however I have never known him to be a thief. perhaps a bit foolish of whome he groups with but a thief no.<br>
<br>
To all those would be guild members that wiped their ass on you without finding out if any of it was true. I would have to say tell em to suck on your wurm. <br>

<br>
Ama seems to be trustworthy, because he doesn't have such an attitude breakout (for my 2cents), and he doesn't look like he would need that money :P. The first part of this whole thread though...what a waste of SL board hehe. If items were stolen, it shouldn't be up here, it doesn't seem. But hey, I hope that everything works out, Ama, it seems that that other guy whom started this post really dislikes you <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .<br>

Well, just a funny beginning and a somewhat resolved end.<br>

He is the reason why I quit eq, this retard stole my fungi tunic, my NOS and other misc items. Originally he was my friend, i gave him this shit for his monk and a few of his twinks. When i ask for the stuff back he claims the stuff is his, because i somehow owe him for something he did for me? /boggle, This amankudo is a real shit head don't be his friend or you'll end up like me and scrildo. Oh i also happen to know scrildo in game he is a great guy he hasn't been on recently so i believe he either quit or he started a new character, because of the rep amankudo is spreading around.<br>
