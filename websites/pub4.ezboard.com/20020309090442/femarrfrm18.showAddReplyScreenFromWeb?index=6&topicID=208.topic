 There are a lot of unsavory things about US foreign policy over the years.  However, there is an old saying 'if you arent part of the solution, youre part of the problem'.  The views a lot of people express over US foreign policy are entirely one-sided and only look at the surface.  <br>
<br>
  In some places in this writing, the US is chastised for inaction and the deaths of 'innocents' placed on our table even though said deaths resulted without any participation or action from the US.  In other cases, the US chooses to back one or the other parties in other countries and is once again villified by those same parties.  This paradox defies any sense of logic.<br>
<br>
  Using such logic it is a lose-lose situation for the US.  If we do anything, or if we do nothing, we are somehow to blame for whatever occurs in other countries.   So in some sense, it matters not what we do for blame will be set on us by some people regardless of our action or lack of action. <br>
<br>
Left entirely to their own destiny after being liberated from Soviet occupation, you see what happens in Afghanistan.  Somehow the US is being blamed for not rebuilding their country after the occupation of the Soviets.  And yet, if we had gone in and helped them setup a democratic govornment we would have most likely been demonized for setting up satellite countries.<br>
<br>
    In the 1980s, Khadafi financed terrorist attacks on commercial jet liners and other civilian targets, and as a result of those terrorist actions he was overtly 'provoked' by US naval forces sailing in international waters ( as defined by the UN ).  He attacked our navy in international waters, something which 50 years ago would have been an act of war.  We destroyed much of his air force and left it at that.  Yet this is now somehow an evil act by the US?<br>
<br>
  The bottom line is that most of these govornments that are 'backed' by the US according to this 'writer' were not set up by the US govornment.  These govornments existed without our help, and I think the US (logically) goes on the assumption that whatever the current govornment in a country is, is who we deal with.  If they are friendly to us, we help them.  If they are not friendly, we do not help them.  If they are directly opposed to US interests, we fight them.  <br>
<br>
 The simple reality of the situation is that many countries have too many radical elements to have any hope of becoming democratic.  Afghanistan is a good example - who do you want in charge, the Taliban or the Northern Alliance?  Anyone here dumb enough to think the Northern Alliance will set up a democracy without a lot of serious arm twisting?  Anyone here think a democracy in Afghanistan will stand, even if it is setup?  Anyone think the rest of the middle east wont howl bloody murder if the US tries to help Afghanistan set up a new govornment?  The most the US can hope is to have a friendly or at least neutral govornment in Afghanistan.  <br>

I turned 18 in 1983.  At every opportunity I voted against Reagan/Bush who supported these actions.  Not much I could have done in the 50's, 60's and 70's, although I did march against some of them as a child of the 60's along with my folks.  Frankly, I don't really see how your cliche' is relevant to the conduct of our nation.  I also fail to see how any of the summaries only &quot;look at the surface.&quot;  If you've ever read Mr. Chomsky, you'll know that the conclusions he's summarized above are not ones that he's pulled out of a hat, but that he's briefly referencing other criticial material he's written.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> In some places in this writing, the US is chastised for inaction and the deaths of 'innocents' placed on our table even though said deaths resulted without any participation or action from the US.

First, if you are going to make such generalizations, perhaps you ought to identify the actual events you reference.  Mr. Chomsky did, so you're required to do the same.  Failing to mention the events you summarize is fighting unfairly.<br>
<br>
As for the supposed paradox, there is nothing paradoxical, illogical or contradictory in the statements.  Some cases support stepping in to stop an atrocity (Kosovo, Somalia), while others don't require such drastic action (Haiti).  Sometimes stepping in is wrong (Guatemala, Dominican Republic, Chile, Iran), while other times leaving things alone is wrong (wasn't an example of that in the article, which again seems to shoot down your criticism).  In the Bible, there are times in the Old Testament that God tells the people of Israel to beat their swords into plowshares, and other times he tells  them to do the opposite.  Sometimes my kids get a time out, sometimes they get a swat on the butt.  Different circumstances call for different responses.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Somehow the US is being blamed for not rebuilding their country after the occupation of the Soviets. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
I haven't seen anyone make this accusation, and there is certainly none of that in this article.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> The bottom line is that most of these govornments that are 'backed' by the US according to this 'writer' were not set up by the US govornment. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Facts please.  Again, Mr. Chomsky has provided the facts, in order to rebut his claims, facts are necessary.  If you read some history other than from Mr. Limbaugh, you'll find that he is correct that we sponsored the coups in Iran, Guatemala, Chile and other places that resulted in the overthrow of legitimate (even democratic) governments, just because they chose to ally with the Soviet Union rather than the US.  That is simply not jusitifiable.<br>
<br>
I disagree with Mr. Chomsky on Libya, Kosovo and the Gulf War, but most of the rest of his criticism of past US policy is quite valid.  I also disagree with some of his criticism of the present effort against Afghanistan.  That country's present leadership has supported terrorists and we must make a strong effort to stop that.<br>
<br>
No one is suggesting that we force a democracy on Afghanistan.  The point of the article is merely to point out, correctly, that we aren't absolutely innocent of our own bad acts against civilian populations.  This does not justify Bin Laden's efforts, but I think it puts our present actions in perspective. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uwarangel1.showPublicProfile?language=EN>WarAngel1</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 30<br> <font color=#E9D756>(10/10/01 4:38:21 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=208.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Solution</span><hr size=1> <br>
Raedwulf : <br>
<br>
  &quot;Facts please. Again, Mr. Chomsky has provided the facts, in order to rebut his claims, facts are necessary.&quot;<br>
<br>
Actually Raedwulf, Chomsky has provided no facts whatsoever.  This is my point entirely.  Listing a series of countries and numerical figures of the dead, and attributing them to the USA, is NOT listing FACTS.   This is probably why no one bothered to post to this thread - its all rhetoric in the original post.  NO FACT AT ALL.<br>
<br>
However, the simple FACT that you blindly follow his conclusions, baseless as they are, shows where your loyalty is (or rather is not) and how easily you have been brainwashed.<br>
<br>
Herein lies the meaning behind my statement :<br>
'if you arent part of the solution, youre part of the problem'<br>
<br>
If you don't know the difference between facts and rhetoric, you are a major part of the problem.  <br>
<br>
Every issue Chomsky lists is extremely complex, yet he simplifies it to a level most mentally challenged folks can undesterdand : give a body count and point a finger.  If that's as deep as your thought process goes, then there is no point discussing it with you.   You will simply choose to believe what you want to believe.  <br>
<br>
My point is not that I know the answers, my point is that even a cursory look at any of these issues shows they are a lot more complex than assigning simple blame.  You can write a book on most of the issues he mentions, and books have been written about most of them.<br>
<br>
I'll take one(1) of the things he lies at the feet of America, the Shah of Iran.   I like this one, because I had a friend in college who was from Iran and she told me some things about the new religious state since the Shah fell from power.  Suffice it to say she did not like the new regime.<br>
<br>
Do you know anything about Iran?  Did you know the Shah ruled for 26 years?  Do you know who ruled Iran prior to the Shah, how they treated their people, and how the Shah treated people?  No?  But you are willing to buy off on assigning the murder of 70,000 Iranians to the USA, just because Chomsky wrote that number down and pointed a finger at the USA?<br>
<br>
The blanket blame is laid at the US for 70,000 deaths in a rebellion against the Shah's predecessor.  I contend that the Shah really didnt have a predecessor in the way Chomsky says, based on the FACTS of history.<br>
<br>
&quot;Subsequent negotiations with the AIOC were unsuccessful, partly because General Ali Razmara, who became prime minister in June 1950, failed to persuade the oil company of the strength of nationalist feeling in the country and<br>
in the Majlis. When the AIOC finally offered fifty-fifty profit-sharing in February 1951, sentiment for nationalization of the oil industry had become widespread. Razmara advised against nationalization on technical grounds and<br>
was assassinated in March 1951 by Khalil Tahmasebi, a member of the militant Fadayan-e Islam. On March 15, the Majlis voted to nationalize the oil industry. In April the shah yielded to Majlis pressure and demonstrations in the<br>
streets by naming Mossadeq prime minister. &quot;<br>
<br>
So, the Shah's 'predecessor' came to power via.. assasination.  And was, in fact, appointed by the Shah (who could in fact appoint anyone he chose).<br>
<br>
<br>
Here is a little snippet about how democracy was expunged from Iran, not by the Shah but by his 'predecessor' :<br>
<br>
&quot;As domestic conditions deteriorated, however, Mossadeq's populist style grew more autocratic. In August 1952, the Majlis acceded to his demand for full powers in all affairs of government for a six-month period. These special powers were subsequently extended for a further six-month term. He also obtained approval for a law to reduce, from six years to two years, the term of the Senate (established in 1950 as the upper house of the Majlis), and thus brought about the dissolution of that body. Mossadeq's support in the lower house of the Majlis (also called the Majlis) was dwindling, however, so on August 3, 1953, the prime minister organized a plebiscite for the dissolution of the Majlis, claimed a massive vote in favor of the proposal, and dissolved the legislative body. &quot;<br>
<br>
Oh and did I mention,  the oil industry in Iran had been nationalized by &quot;Mossadeq&quot;?  BTW, the oil industry in Iran mostly belonged to the British.  That would sort of be like Saudi Arabia ejecting Exxon from their country and claiming all of Exxons private property for themselves.  Imagine the economic and social turmoil that generated in England.<br>
<br>
&quot;The administration of President Harry S Truman initially had been sympathetic to Iran's nationalist aspirations. Under the administration of President Dwight D. Eisenhower, however, the United States came to accept the view of the British government that no reasonable compromise with Mossadeq was possible and that, by working with the Tudeh, Mossadeq was making probable a communist-inspired takeover. Mossadeq's intransigence and inclination to accept Tudeh support, the Cold War atmosphere, and the fear of Soviet influence in Iran also shaped United States thinking. In June 1953, the Eisenhower administration approved a British proposal for a joint Anglo-American operation, code-named Operation Ajax, to overthrow Mossadeq. Kermit Roosevelt of the United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) traveled secretly to Iran to coordinate plans with the shah and the Iranian military, which was led by General Fazlollah Zahedi. &quot;<br>
<br>
So that is how the Shah came into power.  But wait, thats not exacly right.  The Shah was the one who gave power to and in fact appointed &quot;Mossadeq&quot; his supposed predecessor.  So, the Shah must have been in power already, right?  I'll leave that one for you to think about.<br>
<br>
As far as what the Shah did while in power - Education reform, extended womens rights, freed the press, and repaired the economy after Mossadeq's nationalization had wrecked it.  Iran became one of the wealthiest and best-educated middle eastern countries.  <br>
<br>
So how dide he fall from power :<br>
&quot;By late 1976 and early 1977, it was evident that the Iranian economy was in trouble. The shah's attempt to use Iran's vastly expanded oil revenues after 1973 for an unrealistically ambitious industrial and construction program and<br>
a massive military buildup greatly strained Iran's human and institutional resources and caused severe economic and social dislocation. Widespread official corruption, rapid inflation, and a growing gap in incomes between the<br>
wealthier and the poorer strata of society fed public dissatisfaction. <br>
<br>
In response, the government attempted to provide the working and middle classes with some immediate and tangible benefits of the country's new oil wealth. The government nationalized private secondary schools, declared that<br>
secondary education would be free for all Iranians, and started a free meal program in schools. It took over private community colleges and extended financial support to university students. It lowered income taxes, inaugurated<br>
an ambitious health insurance plan, and speeded up implementation of a program introduced in 1972, under which industrialists were required to sell 49 percent of the shares of their companies to their employees. The programs<br>
were badly implemented, however, and did not adequately compensate for the deteriorating economic position of the urban working class and those, who, like civil servants, were on fixed salaries. To deal with the disruptive<br>
effects of excessive spending, the government adopted policies that appeared threatening to the propertied classes and to bazaar, business, and industrial elements who had benefited from economic expansion and might have<br>
been expected to support the regime. For example, in an effort to bring down rents, municipalities were empowered to take over empty houses and apartments and to rent and administer them in place of the owners. In an effort to<br>
bring down prices in 1975 and 1976, the government declared a war on profiteers, arrested and fined thousands of shopkeepers and petty merchants, and sent two prominent industrialists into exile. <br>
<br>
Moreover, by 1978 there were 60,000 foreigners in Iran--45,000 of them Americans--engaged in business or in military training and advisory missions. Combined with a superficial Westernization evident in dress, life styles, music,<br>
films, and television programs, this foreign presence tended to intensify the perception that the shah's modernization program was threatening the society's Islamic and Iranian cultural values and identity.&quot;<br>
<br>
Bottom line : the economy went bad and they didnt like the West - it went against Islam.<br>
<br>
It's worth noting that the fall of the Shah and the rise of the Ayatollah was followed by years of war with Iraq.  They Ayatollah needed a war to fight to stay in power.<br>
<br>
My thought is that Chomsky is like a reverse Joe McCarthy, instead of stirring up americans to hate communists Chomsky stirs up Americans to hate themselves.  Its a really easy tactic: tell people a few lies, mix in a few truths and whole hell of a lot of half-truths and do so in such quantity that by the time some of your points are disproven you've already told 100 more lies.  Nobody can keep up.<br>

Actually, my guess is no one bothered to read this thread because the topic was kinda boring, the post was long, and few had the energy or interest in doing so.<br>
<br>
2.  Sure, Chomsky only published summaries of conclusions he and other historians have previously made.  You didn't even cite what you were criticizing though.<br>
<br>
3.  I understand the difference between facts and rhetoric.  I haven't seen that same understanding on your part.  Chomsky stated numerous facts.  Although you may disagree with the conclusions he draws, the fact remains that he's got facts there.  And as those base facts are merely the background for his conclusion, a full dissertation of the each is neither necessary nor advisable.<br>
<br>
4.  Lots of people didn't like the Shah or what replaced him.  Not much to recommend either of them.  What happened after the Shah was deposed is irrelevant.<br>
<br>
5.  Your quotation of others is finally what was necessary to critique Chomsky's conclusions.  Rather than just say he was full of shit, some pointed and specific criticism was required.<br>
<br>
6.  I'm afraid you still don't get the point.  Regardless of what existed prior to the Shah or what replaced him, we helped put him in power and he did some awful things while there.  Sure he did some decent things for some, but the ends don't justify the means.<br>
<br>
Chomsky's point is that we can't take the moral highground when we've commited our own atrocities in the name of Democracy and the American Way.  So far, your statements have not really challenged that conclusion. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uwarangel1.showPublicProfile?language=EN>WarAngel1</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 31<br> <font color=#E9D756>(10/10/01 10:18:34 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=208.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Solution</span><hr size=1> <br>

<br>
I never said we had the moral high ground.  We have a right to defend ourselves, and that responsibility lies with the govornment.  <br>
<br>
And as far as this :<br>
&quot;5. Your quotation of others is finally what was necessary to critique Chomsky's conclusions. Rather than just say he was full of shit, some pointed and specific criticism was required.&quot;<br>
<br>
That's exactly my point, and precisely why I dont like people like Chomsky who lists one accusation after another in a bang-bang McCarthyistic style.  It takes too much research and work to show the fallacies in his 10-second 'conclusions' for dozens of incidents.<br>
<br>
<br>
Certainly some of what Chomsky said was true as far as numbers, but his statements are made in such as way as to direct the reader to believe his opinions about those facts.  Things like :<br>
&quot;I continue to be horrified by the sanctions on Iraq, which have resulted in the death of over 1,000,000 Iraqis, including over 500,000 children, &quot;<br>
<br>
The reality is that food and medical supplies are available to Iraq, but its govornment chooses to use it to feed and finance its military and terrorist organizations rather than feed and care for its people.  I think this says a lot more about Iraq's govornement than it does about the US.  Remember, Iraq is the country that used mustard and nerve gas on its own people.<br>
<br>
I quote this again from my past post, Chomsky in a nutshell :<br>
&quot;Its a really easy tactic: tell people a few lies, mix in a few truths and whole hell of a lot of half-truths and do so in such quantity that by the time some of your points are disproven you've already told 100 more lies. Nobody can keep up.&quot;<br>

al be it a small race of islanders totally destroyed , and Englands? well .. murdering every tasmainian aboriginie.. well that just plain obscene.<br>

In the eyes of the terrorists, the US has done wrong and must pay. The US has fucked with the middle east, and the terrorists are trying to fuck the US. You nor I made any comments about who started it, whether the attacks were uprovoked, or whether the motives were justified or pure hatred (or justified hatred).<br>
<br>
Feather, &quot;mostly ignoring&quot; the actions of terrorists in the past has consisted of supplying Israel with the military and political support which is the only thing allowing them to continue to occupy the lands that the Palestinians regard as theirs, and murder Palestinians with US weapons.<br>
<br>
Bin Laden does not want you dead because you're civilized etc. He want's you dead because he thinks that killing people in the country which has been committing unprovoked acts of terrorism on innocent people in his own country might convince that country to stop it's behaviour. At least I think that's his primary motive.<br>
