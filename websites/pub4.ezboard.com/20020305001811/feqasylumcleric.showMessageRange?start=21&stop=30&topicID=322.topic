 I am sure you will all agree there is enough &quot;thread hijacking&quot; and possibly someone else may want to give some advice or insight they picked up in their experience to get the cleric epic. BUT- they may be hesitant from the other posts.<br>
<br>
  I respect the right of you all to give your views and opinions. BUT- since I am indirectly part of the impetus bringing about this discussion I fell I have the right to request this. <br>
<br>

Yes the thread has been hijacked plenty enough, I'll ignore the childish personal insults since my last post from one person, at your request, this is only a reply to other posters.<br>
<br>
Good luck to the original poster. You will need it. But remember, *most* epicless clerics are pretty reasonable people, who can be negotiated with. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Besides the fact that the whole post is responding to quotes in this thread ;P*<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> And then sat there for the next hour buffing and waiting on your MA.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Actually I didn't even pick a MA until time to keel Rage, because we had a few 60 warriors there.  Yes, we were buffing (one chanter...40ish peeps...trying to lead and buff heh), but we were also waiting on people who wanted to be there for Lash's final epic battle, and trying to get all the info we could on the &quot;new&quot; Rage.  I had no idea how difficult he would be, seeing as that was my first time going against him.  He wasn't nearly as difficult as I expected, and we hardly had any deaths.<br>
<br>
If we had had to, we could've gotten minimal buffs and keeled him with the groups we had there within 15 minutes, although I would've been very nervous doing that against a dragon I had never fought before.  My &quot;record&quot; (old Rage) for hearing Rage was up, gathering a force, getting peeps ported to LS, getting to Naggy's lair, grouping, buffing, spawning and slaughtering rage is under 30 minutes for all if it for Mindaru's epic.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> but for many instances/people, that's NOT the case, they really spend 1-2-3-4 hours getting people there, buffing them...oops wrong buffs. rebuff. oh 9 people LD. etc etc.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Yes, there are not many peeps out there who are stellar at organizing and leading raids, and there are always noobs who have never been on such a raid and don't know that to do.  Should they be punished for that?  I see it as a skill you do or don't have -- some peeps are natural organizers/leaders and can perfect that skill, some are just not.  I don't feel like anyone has the right to run someone over simply because they are not good at it.  Now if they literally cannot get people there and keel rage, that's different, but if they are capable of it given a reasonable amount of time and effort, I do think it's very wrong to run them over.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> But at what point does that become ludicrious? 1 hour? 2? 6?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
For a brand new spawn that hardly anyone knows anything about, I'd say an hour or an hour and a half is fair.  Now that I know what I'm up against, I doubt I'd ever take longer than 30-45 minutes to assemble and keel Rage.  But again, I don't feel it's fair to punish those who work just as hard but just aren't quite as good at organizing.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> while they pretend like they've never been on a vox raid and learned how to buff.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
That's something else -- I don't know where some of those peeps came from the other day, friends of Brizzo's or Lash's or just decided to join us, but man there were some who had no clue how to buff for a dispelling dragon! :P<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> I have an issue with the mentality behind the roll and the people that want a list for Rage, and what I think it teaches people.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Ok let me explain it to you again.  There was NO LIST involved here.  Both clerics camped rage and saw him up at about the same time.  They didn't put their names on a list or a calendar and wait for &quot;their turn.&quot;  They had no reservation and nothing handed to them.  They simply got there at the same time and had to find a way to resolve it.  Your method of resolving it would've (apparently) been to try to run the TRK forces over.  Brizzo's and Lashanna's was to roll.<br>
<br>
What on earth does that have to do with a list?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Why does this offend so many people, that I can be so anti such a concept, and *still* do the right thing<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Your answer to the above conflict would've been either to &quot;say that this is pathetic and walk away in disgust&quot; or to run our raid over, according to everything you have said here.  So those, in your opinion, are &quot;doing the right thing?&quot;<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> I see the roll as a way to ensure the wait could continue without contention, to stall, essentially. Maybe I'm wrong.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
You are wrong, and I resent the implication that we needed some device to &quot;stall&quot; in order to kill something like Ragefire.  Talk to me in game if you would like a list of the numerous baddies we have keeled spur of the moment with little or no problem whatsoever.<br>
<br>
As for the real reason why I proposed a roll, well if you don't understand it by now no amount of explaining is going to make it clear.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> But most of the people that hate &quot;the race&quot; usually toss up Uberguilds as the reason they hate it, because they can't &quot;beat them in a race&quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
And you know that mine and Felishanna's &quot;excuse&quot; has to do with principle, courtesy, and what we think is right and wrong.  So this is all irrelevant.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Does it change that to me the idea of the roll is completely abhorent? No.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
So you really do feel like the very best resolution to that conflict was a race?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> We've never passed down the chance to add our forces when we didn't get there first.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
But who was there first?  Brizzo or Lashanna?  Ok we both know that MW and TRK are capable of assembling and killing Ragefire within a reasonable amount of time.  That is not a problem.<br>
<br>
However, Brizzo was pretty sure that he was there first, but Lashanna was pretty sure that when she checked the spawn he was not in the zone.  So who was there first?  If TRK had taken the spawn and Brizzo was sure he had been there first, he would've been bitter, as well as some of MW I'm sure.  If MW had forced us to race, TRK would've been bitter, even if we had won.  We hate racing.  If MW had gotten there right after us but managed to organize and beat us to it, there would've been a lot of hurt friendships between the two guilds.  There really is no way around it in a race situation.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  And I respected my friend enough to not only to be there for him, but to take part in something I personally detest (the roll), because it was the *right thing to do*<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
So you DO think rolling was the right thing to do?  /sigh, you are confusing me. :P<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Again, Adjani, CONCEPT. Not people.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  I'd have walked away in disgust if I had been asked to &quot;roll&quot; for my epic. That's not epic, that's pathetic.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Adjani's interpretation: the action of me asking Brizzo for a roll was pathetic and would've earned Rugen's disgust if it had been him.  Am I wrong?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Sorry, that's a Felis thing, since that's his pet cause.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Why do you keep calling Feli a him?  The character is a female, and as far as I know you have not met him/her in RL so you have no idea about his/her RL gender, so why not just call Feli a she, just like you call me a she since my characters are females but you don't know me in RL?  Sorry, it's just bugging me, and it seems like you are doing it to irk Feli or something.  If you think Feli acts like a guy, you might as well call me a him too because most peeps think &quot;I have more balls than most men they know.&quot; :P<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Again, I don't get it. It should be abundantly clear who has a force capable of taking down the mob.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
On the day in question, it was &quot;abundantly clear&quot; that TRK had a capable force pouring into the zone and MW had one a few seconds away from porting into the zone.  I considered it that we both had a raid capable force ready at the same time.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Felis and I have done this dance many a time on many a post.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Yeah, and I wish you two would quit sniping at each other, it accomplishes nothing and simply makes the whole thing more unpleasant to read.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  What's disrespectful about being prepared, ready, and raring to go invade France, while those 6 guys stand by the side of the road trying to recruit an army?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
What did I say about 6 people standing on the road trying to recruit an army?  If you want to make it applicable to the situation, make it comparable.  More like -- two almost equally capable armies meet on the road both trying to conquer france.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  Because, as I said, it promotes the idea (as I see it) that you can't get it any other way than if random luck assigns it to you.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Both Lashanna and Brizzo camped Rage, long and hard.  Both had large raid forces willing to help them at a moment's notice.  I don't see what random luck has to do with any of that.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Had MW ported in and found Adjani's raid capable force, you better believe we would have asked &quot;Need a few more swords and a bit of healing?&quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
But that is basically what happened. :P  And Brizzo did not want to give up his &quot;claim&quot; -- I don't blame him.  So our groups got there a few minutes before his.  He had groups coming, he saw Rage about the same time as Lash, and both raids probably could've been ready to keel him at about the same time, maybe ours a little sooner because of our &quot;head start.&quot;  Because her guild got there a few mere minutes before MW did, that makes Lashanna deserve her epic more than Brizzo?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> before adjani bites my head off thinking I am talking about her raid :P<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
/BITE ( :P )<br>
<br>
Basically, Rugen, I understand your stance, and while I don't agree with it that's not what I'm trying to argue here.  God knows I've had that argument enough times on these boards in the past. :P<br>
<br>
I am trying to show that it is not applicable here.  There was no raid capable force that was made to wait while one cleric stalled trying to scrape together people.  There was no &quot;list&quot; that you had to get on in order to get your turn at rage.  There was nothing handed to anyone, and nothing lame or pathetic about what happened.  I just don't see how your views on FFA, racing etc. are applicable to this case.<br>
<br>

<br>
A solution was reached that was acceptable to the principle people involved ( brizzo and lashanna ).<br>
<br>
A cleric epic entered the game ( lashanna's ).<br>
<br>
Clerics usually are peaceful folk, who spend many, many, MANY man / woman hours in game just running around to save others lost experience.  Most clerics are extremely helpful if treated with even a LITTLE bit of respect.<br>
<br>
Cleric epics = good for the community at large.<br>
<br>
The rest of this debate should be moved to rants, since thats what it has turned into.  The original poster was asking for some advice, and the thread has turned into a personal campaign by several to make a point.<br>
<br>
The point should be made somewhere else.. not here.<br>
<br>
Yeah, i ,know i am not a cleric, nor do i have c3 to lure clerics around with <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> , but the class forums are generally friendly places.  lets keep em that way <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
