<br>
I am looking for some advice from more experienced players.  I am just now reaching the level where I can participate in plane and dragon raids (47 now) and am looking forward to it immensely.<br>
<br>
The first raid I will attend is in Hate (I loved the idea of being initiated on Phread’s raid).  My thought is to attend at least three (maybe four our five) raids to learn how to work effectively in large multi-group settings, and to learn the plane, mobs, strategies, etc.  After that, I wanted to try the same number of raids in Fear.  <br>
<br>
However, I’ve seen some posts about players who only attend raids in planes where “their” armor drops, and that they are perceived as greedy or self-centered.  I know Hate has a number of enchanter items, but I would rather learn one area and learn it well before trying another plane.  Will this give others the perception that I’m only focusing on the plane where enchanter armor drops?  I know Fear has cryosilk, which is designed for intelligence casters, so don’t know if that makes a difference.<br>
<br>
Let me know your thoughts.  If I will damage my reputation by focusing on one plane until I am operating at peak efficiency, then I would rather go ahead and try to learn two planes at once.  Thank you for your feedback!<br>

<br>
It doesn't really make a difference which plane you go to to &quot;learn how to raid.&quot;  Both are pretty much identical in terms of mob levels and strategies employed by the raids.  The only only real differences are those of flavors...<br>
<br>
Hate = run to break location, camp, then come back and pull patrols that path nearby<br>
Hate = 2 floors = AE spells aggro stuff on 2nd floor = don't use AE spells<br>
Hate = smaller aggro radius + lots of buildings to block line of sight<br>
Hate = lots of gem drops<br>
Fear = run to break location and immediately fight patrols that swoop through the camp regularly<br>
Fear = single level = AE spells ok<br>
Fear = crazy, insane aggro from seemingly beyond visual range + little to block line of sight<br>
Fear = not many enchanter drops i.e. big bonus points in the oppinion polls<br>
Fear = low gem drops<br>
<br>
<br>
I've been on about 4 raids in each plane now.  And honestly I could probably lead a raid in either at this point.  /shrug I don't think going to 4 or 5 hate raids would give you a &quot;reputation.&quot;  But at the same time I don't see any really need to limit yourself to Hate in order to learn about raiding.  IMO Fear can be a pretty good training ground for getting people to follow instructions as the break in is much less forgiving.<br>

My advice would be to go to both planes.  There is no need to &quot;fine tune&quot; in one before you go to the other.<br>
<br>
Doubtful you will be the &quot;main&quot; enchanter for the raid, given your level (high 40s), so, keep open communication with the other enchanter(s), and have fun <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
No, i dont think you will develop a rep, but, there is no reason to approach it like your thinking either.<br>

<br>
In fact.. up until these last two I went on, I'd seen as many cryosilk drops in hate as insidious... nuts eh?  This is because on many many raids, the enchanter mobs never get fully pulled and even when they are, the drops are few and far between.<br>
<br>
I would advise against this idea of just going to 1 plane to &quot;learn the ropes&quot;.  If your posting here asking us if you look greedy, I suspect your conscience is already nagging you.  This sounds like a justification to me and your asking for our stamp of approval.<br>
<br>
When I was up and coming my first 8 planes raids were, 1 hate and 7 fear.  Why?  I found hate to be extremely dull.  It was to easy!  Fear on the other hand was a challenge to be conquered.  The break had gotten us several times.  There was real risk and real sense of accomplishment if you succeeded ( at least in the break ).  <br>
<br>
Now - for me - Fear has become somewhat routine.  Hate's been revamped and is offering new and different challenges.<br>
<br>
Do whatever you find fun.<br>

I did fear 4 times before doing hate. I dunno why. /shrug<br>
I seriously doubt you'd lose your rep or anything. I doubt anyone keeps track of everyone that goes to which raid. Both planes have one thing going for them in my eyes, and not much else.<br>
<br>
Fear: If your in the break for about 5-10 minutes its pretty damn exciting and fun. After the break, or if your not in the break, it gets tedious. Although I've never fought any of the boss mobs since the change. So that may add some more excitement. <br>
<br>
Hate: Is tedious from the beginning. No fun break. But Chanter armor drops here so that adds a bit of excitement everytime you see a Rev. Even 2nd floor isn't that exciting. (To me anyway) Or maybe its just that everytime we get to floor 2, I'm already burned out. <br>

Hell, I had a lot more Fear than Hate raids for a loooong time, although it's finally flipped over to about 18 Hate and 15 Fear.. <br>
<br>
I personally find Fear *insanely* dull after the break.  All pulls are routine, hardly ever any adds, and usually only 3 or 4 mobs at the most.  The only exception to that besides the break would be the Temple, if you're lucky enough to have it pulled.<br>
<br>
Hate I like.  In Hate, there can be wandering adds.  Pathing in Hate is absolutely horrible, and sometimes you'll get 8 mobs charging your raid.  Am I a bit of a masochist?  I guess, but that's the kinda stuff that makes this game all the more worthwhile for me - The stuff that gets your heart pounding, your mind blasting, and leaves you with a real sense of accomplishment - something I think is unique (not that other classes don't feel this way - I just mean, in the sense that, "Hey, I can't believe I kept that under control and lived to tell about it") to the enchanter class and one of the biggest reasons I'm so happy I chose it.  <br>
<br>
I've had some absolutely epic battles in Hate, but I don't mean to turn you off Fear.  You learn a LOT, very FAST by going to either plane.  Probably one of the most important lessons you'll learn right away is not to be afraid to get HIT.  Because some of that stuff hits HARD and FAST and it takes nerves of steel to stand there trying to mez/stun/control it in some way without running crying like a little baby for someone to get it off you.<br>
<br>
So... go to both planes.  Watch, learn, and LISTEN (key advice for a raid) and I gurantee you will learn an incredible amount in only a few raids. <p><center><img src = http://members.bellatlantic.net/~mezner/daeonsig2.jpg><br>

<br>
In response to some comments, the reason I wanted to focus on one plane was because I assumed there are different mobs in each plane with different abilities/resists.  Some will be magic resistant, some can be mes'd, some won't be able to be mes'd.  I am also known as being &quot;directionally challenged&quot;... OK, I get lost all the time... <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   so didn't want to confuse two new areas and turn left when I should be turning right, etc.  Will I learn a new geographic location, and remember what I can do with all mobs, and learn how to be an effective member in a multi-group event in a single raid?  I doubt it.  I know myself, and know that I have to practice to become good at what I do.  But then I tend to be a perfectionist and take it as a personal afront if anyone dies on my watch.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Your perception about &quot;justifying&quot; my decision is unwarranted, Akbar.  If Phread were leading a Fear raid, I would plan to focus on Fear for my first several raids.  I signed up for Hate only because Phread was leading it.  I don't care where I start, I just want to learn my role and learn it well enough that people look forward to seeing me sign up for a raid, rather than cringing when they see my name.  <br>
<br>
I asked for the advice of experienced enchanters because I have only been in one two-group event before, which wasn't particularly successful (mostly because people wouldn't listen to the leader).  What you (as a group) appear to be saying is that the geography and different mobs won't make a difference.  <br>
<br>
My only question is....are any of you &quot;directionally challenged?&quot;  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rollin --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/roll.gif ALT=":rollin"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>Myschief Maker<BR>

However nobody has yet let me pull a plane for them. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><img src="http://www.annastazia.homestead.com/files/adjani.jpg" alt="Adjani Tristesse, Goddess of Lanys"></img>

And based on all of your advice, I won't worry about learning one area well, but will try alternating the planes.  Thanks so much for your help!   <p>Myschief Maker<BR>

Anyhow I have pulled most everywhere that I have been in an exp group, and lots of raids I have been on too.  Pulling = fun, no matter how much everyone makes fun of you for being a chanter puller! :P<br>
<br>
P.S. for all you aspiring chanter pullers out there, the bedlam line is a must!  The tank in the group will generally have a snide remark to make about the chanter pulling, so you can just throw back at him &quot;Oh yeah?  Why dontcha ask the cleric who she has to heal more on pulls, me or you?&quot; :P <p><img src="http://www.annastazia.homestead.com/files/adjani.jpg" alt="Adjani Tristesse, Goddess of Lanys"></img>
