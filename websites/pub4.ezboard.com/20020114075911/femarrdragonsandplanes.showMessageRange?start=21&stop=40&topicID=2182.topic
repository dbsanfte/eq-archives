Wrong. I said, everyone should have the SAME chance of getting something out of it. If the warrior in the group gets (exp+loot) and the casters in the group get (exp), then the benefits are not equal.<br>

How many times have you seen people quick to ask the cleric if he needs the donals arms that just dropped, knowing damn well that he doesn't need them? Boy, aren't we nice for offering him that piece of shit can't sell for the life of me item. As soon as the big money maker drops though, bam, &quot;I want in this roll&quot;, &quot;it says all\all&quot;.<br>
<br>
Last night in fact my group had a SBC drop in OS. After about 30-40 minutes of discussion the non melee classes finally backed down. The roll ended up being between me, warrior with fbss, rogue with epic, and bard(not sure what haste he had). Now if it were true NBG I can argue that I was the most in NEED of this item sine the rogues epic had great haste and bard song does as well. <br>
<br>
Out of the three of us though I was the only one who offered to give in my haste(fbss) to the group to random if I won. I did this because I really want to use the item that dropped. And it would be nice to reward the others as well. <br>
<br>
But the only way I have ever found a flawless loot system is with your RL friends or just good friends in game you can trust. I know damn well if I was with my friends last night and the group was, cleric, druid, ench, war, rogue with epic, bard. I would have an SBC on my back right now, because they would all agree thats where it should go.<br>
<br>
The system would work great if every person were truly honest with themselves. Which won't happen. <br>
<br>
A good solution would be for verant to make the really good items no drop and take those damn all\all tags off.<br>

<br>
NBG works if you are with people you trust. If i was in a group of lets say half SF and half MS people i would believe them 100% if they said they needed an item that dropped cause i trust them. (except those shady halflings) <br>
<br>
If I was in a random group i would figure that 50% of those claiming need probably want it to sell just cause a large percentage of the younger EQ generation is greedy fucks. I wouldn't care tho most likely ... just cause I'm not obsessed about how colorful my pixels are, or if I can swing my pixels 0.3% faster. <br>
<br>
By doing NBG you will make friends cause its really cool having other people congratulating you and giving you an item you really could use. You will be remembered for it.<br>
<br>
By doing ffa its just every man for himself - phat lewts is the center of attention. You're not there to help friends get equipped, or maybe to pick up a nice item for yourself ... you're there cause you get a hardon by getting cooler pixels that you can trade for other pixels.<br>
<br>
Ofcourse NBG doesn't work in zones infested with assholes and greedy fucksticks like the popular hunting dungeons are ... just establish the order before killing and noone has a reason to bitch when phat lewts drop. <br>
<br>
Just have fun and let the loot come eventually, EQ is so much more fun when you're not stressing over loot - I never thought i would own any of the highlvl loots ever ... but eventually I got some very nice stuff - because i'm in a guild of friends who help eachother. You will be so much more happy by making someone else happy, than if you got another couple pixels to drag around. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/bemarr.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=sagemon>Sagemon</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 151<br> <font color=#E9D756>(7/26/01 3:28:36 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: NBG... how is this fair?</span><hr size=1> Roble's story illustrates two of the problems that arise with NBG.  First, how do you decide who &quot;needs&quot; something?  Roble's group followed NBG, but his warrior still wound up rolling against a bard and a rogue for a haste item.  Without getting into all of the arguments about haste items, suffice it to say that reasonable minds could differ as to whether the bard and the rogue &quot;needed&quot; a haste item.  Even if you think that a rogue or a bard has a &quot;need&quot; for a haste item, most people would agree that their &quot;need&quot; is much less than that of a warrior.<br>
<br>
If I had been in Roble's group, I would have bowed out of the roll on a haste item if a warrior said he needed it.  If the warrior didn't need it, I would be hesitant to step aside for a bard or a rogue.  Someone would have to sell that one to me.<br>
<br>
By the way, is the haste from Ragebringer stackable with haste from an SBC?  If not, the rogue had no business being in that roll at all.<br>
<br>
Second, if you impose a &quot;trade in&quot; requirement, how do you deal with no drop items?  The rogue can't give his epic to the group, but Roble would be required to give his FBSS to the group.  Trade-in requirements sound great in the abstract, but they don't do so well in reality. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ubeemine.showPublicProfile?language=EN>BeeMine</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 8<br> <font color=#E9D756>(7/26/01 4:14:14 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> response central</span><hr size=1> heh way more responses than I expected... I'm not as coordinated as the rest of you so I can't respond to lots of different posts.  <br>
<br>
Let me reinforce my point alittle... I'm very new to the game... level 51 in just over 2 months... so yes I play too much... but exp in 51... barely moves... and my guild seems small or I'm not in enough with my higher level guildmates since I raced up the levels not caring about loot either. I've always thought.. who cares about loot.. I Can get higher levels so I can camp more cool items when I want... or by myself or something.<br>
I suppose in my mad dash to get high level... I didn't make near enough friends that continually play game or picked a bad guild.... I don't know... I do LOVE my guild but we don't raid hardly at all.. and lots of high levels that I did know have moved on to bigger and 'better' guilds. So I'm SOL on getting guild raids for items I need.. and if I did I'd feel greedy because someone else could be out getting exp somewhere... I can't stand evercamping so I'd like to be able to roll for decent items so I can afford to pay people for their evercamping or getting exp and loot they can sell.  <br>
<br>
And I believe there ARE people that NBG something in OS to sell it... so therefore I still don't like NBG. I was nervous that even posting this that too many people would say NBG is the way it is your points are completely invalid get lost newbie. I'm glad I'm not the only one that doesn't agree. i'm not out there for phat lewtz or however you spell that... or for greed... <br>
<br>
I'd just like a fair share of the items... so maybe one day I can afford to make 200 wis... or ... maybe some resist gear... since being screwed as an iksar ... there's even fewer and fewer items I can actually use... <br>
I'm thinking I'm going to start another rant.. on how are iksar sham's balanced next.<br>
<br>
none of my RL friends are over level 41 or so... and the higher levels that I know of in my guild are rarely on.. prob for the same reason I am... I'm having a hard time finding zones that I like to hunt in... or that drop anything more than ultra rare that I might be allowed to roll on. as for bitching... no I don't take up time bitching in raids or groups when something drops that I should be allowed to roll on it.. once a majority opinion for or against me has been decided and I have made 1 or 2 points.. I shut up..<br>
<br>
 like the OS group I Was talking about ... no one answered me again on the matter.. so I stopped talking about it. but when my point is that it's NBG and I can't loot anything that will drop.... and a cleric is masterlooting... and like the last cleric will forget to share money with group when she leaves... or forget that.. hey someone is leaving... they didn't remember to get their share... oh well.<br>
<br>
All I can say is thank god for blue diamonds and the greater gems... at least I might get exp+loot out of a camp. but still a 40k plus item drops and I'm not allowed to roll on it... but it's ok because 4k BDs drop and I can roll on them. <br>
<br>
As for melees being all about their gear... well them having GREAT gear still does NOTHING for when they die.... having a caster or a melee with better gear just tilts the odds alittle... if you lose control of the fight or are overwhelmed by mobs you all can die the same... regardless of who won the 40k item that just dropped.<br>
<br>
<br>
That's all I can remember to respond to =).<br>

Here is my point/side of the argument.. Why didn't i as a caster get to roll on it so i could go trade it in for something i could use or something that i &quot;need&quot;.. I could use a new robe or new armor or a new primary.. i could use a lot of things.. BTW did u know there is under 10 things in OS that casters can &quot;legaly&quot; roll on under the NBG rules.. i say if ure gonna wear it then roll if not let us all roll on things.. like in OS a SBC dropped.. this item is FAR better than my mystic cloak.. the guy who won it was wearing an RBG and clamed NBG.. i would have worn that cloak in an instant.. the next week his RBG was on the boards for ale 55k.. i could use 55k like anyone else.. its just not too fair..<br>

NBG primarilly came about because melee types were irked over having to roll against casters for their gear. However I have to agree that with NGB in effect it makes some zones completely unpalatable for int casters, who have no real hope of winning anything. Wisdom casters are almost as bad off - but not quite as they can still shoot for armor pieces. Until I had read this thread I had forgotten all about iksar shaman though - they are just as badly hosed as int casters. Now I wouldn't really mind if there was some way to compensate for the non-loot , but there isn't really any good way to do it. FFA doesn't really work either, but I notice clerics get to keep most of the gems that drop in exchange for the expense they go through in periodots - hmm maybe there could be something similar done for those that hunt in a group and have NO chance at getting a piece of loot? maybe, but I am not certain as to how to do it fairly, perhaps someone in this forum could come up with an idea.

<br>
I am an Enchanter.<br>
<br>
As an Enchanter I get to roll on:<br>
<br>
In Karnor's?<br>
     Book of the Obulus (8 int 8 wis 45 mana 5 v. fire 5 v. magic)  --  against every other INT and WIS caster.<br>
<br>
In Sebilis?<br>
     Froglok Bonecaster Robe (10 ac 8 str 8 int 40 mana 10 v. fire 10 v. magic)  -- against every other INT caster.<br>
     Hierophant's Cloak (10 ac 4 str 4 sta 4 agi 4 dex 4 wis 4 int 4 cha 75 hp 75 mana) -- against everyone.<br>
     Worn Cloth Mantle (6 ac 5 str 9 agi 5 cha) -- against the Bard.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
While I'd like not to complain about NBG...  just how do I acquire anything (like the Velium Blue Diamond Bracelets I feel I need to join just about any guild out there) without selling the Bonecaster Robe I won on NBG?<br>
<br>
And need is so arbitrary...  I need those Fire Opals that drop for my jewelcrafting as much as the Clerics do for gems...  I'd like to at least split them or roll.  It's not as if I can buy Fire Opals from a merchant.<br>
<br>
<br>
In my opinion, NBG just forces people to sell what they can camp and use to buy what they need.  I've always had an unorthodox set of equipment...  I liked to use a Gilded Cloth and still wear a Loam Sash.  Since I can't camp these items, and since I don't have an opportunity to roll on almost everything that drops where I can go somewhat safely, what alternatives am I left with but sell things I can get into groups to camp, like the Book of the Obulus?<br>
<br>
To everyone who answers &quot;Farm jewelry&quot;, there are two things you're missing.<br>
<br>
1) The market is overstocked with jewelers under the same dillusion.<br>
2) You need money to begin jewelcrafting in the first place.<br>
<br>
<br>
To those who answer &quot;Relocate&quot;, I ask you this; how often can you join a pickup Hate group?  Or Hole group?  There simply aren't the same quantity or calibur pick up groups for casters.<br>
<br>
<br>
But hey, flame away.  Won't be the first time, and I'll be shocked if it's the last.  All this being said, I still suffer with NBG silently, in every group I'm in, and patiently await something else. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uramierez.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ramierez</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 175<br> <font color=#E9D756>(7/26/01 11:55:31 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.midnightsojourn.com/images/ramierez.jpg WIDTH=90 HEIGH=110></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: NBG... how is this fair?</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Quote:<br>

Wrong. I said, everyone should have the SAME chance of getting something out of it. If the warrior in the group gets (exp+loot) and the casters in the group get (exp), then the benefits are not equal.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

This is where you don't seem to understand...you join a group for experience...That is your goal.  Equipment should be a bonus...if you camp crypt in OS...you don't Know that you'll get shit in items, you might get PH's all night.  You do Know that you'll get good xp as long as the group doesn't wipe out.<br>
<br>
Scenario A) You join a group going to camp the shroom king.  Everything's going well and you camp down there for a few hours, but the bastard doesn't show.  In that course of time everyone makes about 2-4 blue bubbles of xp.  Afterwards you port/gate out and everyone goes their separate ways happy with the night's xp.<br>
<br>
Scenario B) You join a group going to camp the shroom king.  Everything's going well and you camp down there for a few hours, and on the last pull the king drops a fungi tunic.  In that course of time everyone made 2-4 blue bubbles of xp.<br>
<br>
There's many smaller scenarios that develop from this whether you use NBG or GBN but we'll go with the basics.  Let's say you do NBG and random it between the chain+ classes and a shaman, like our thread starter, with obviously fairly poor gear, wins the tunic.  He's extremely happy(duh), and you all still walk away that you would've from scenario A.  Explain to me how this scenario would hurt you?<br>
<br>
The other way it could go is if you do GBN.  The enchanter of the group wins, which of course makes our poorly equipped shaman from the earlier example a little sad at losing something he would've worn fulltime.  Suddenly the enchanter tells the group, 'hey buddy...if you want it I'll sell it to you for 40k'(or whatever the fuck the going price on those things are nowadays)  Is this right? according to your example it is...yet you spoke of everyone have equitable rights to everything...well...the shaman was a part of the group that killed the king and got the tunic, according to you he earned it just as much as anyone else in the group, yet now he's having to pay the enchanter of the same group to get it.<br>
<br>
<br>
Just to add...along with this type of shit I'm always listening to some of the newer players bitch about how they deserve to see the 'end game' as much as anyone.  Just ask Bolvi how well his wanting the 'right' to random for anything that drops got him into MS. <p><center><i><b><font size="3" face="Ariel Narrow"><font color="red">Ramierez D`Elerian Draegonis</i></b></font></font><i><b><font size="2" face="Ariel Narrow"><font color="blue"><br>A Wizard's soul is forged in the crucible of magic.~~Antimodes of the White Robes.</i></b></font></font></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ugladetree.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gladetree</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 147<br> <font color=#E9D756>(7/27/01 12:39:20 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: NBG... how is this fair?</span><hr size=1> Listen, I'm not going to try to articulate the argument any further, Ramierez is doing just fine, but I'll show you why NBG works through personal example.<br>
<br>
I'm level 52 or so, in Karnor's.  Good luck occurs, I get into Drolvarg Captain camp.  Approximately half an hour later, Cappy spawns, with Lupine Dagger.  The first words out of all five people's mouths (since I was the only ranger and wasn't wielding one) was "congrats!".  That dagger has never left my weapon slots ever since and I'm 12 blues into 59.  I've been offered a Manastone for it, and 40kpp outright.  Some of you may look at this example and say "well shit, ain't he just an honorable guy, what a self-serving jackass" or "well he was with friends" well guess what, I don't care what you think of me, and I don't remember a goddamn person in the group that day, but I love em all just the same.  <br>
<br>
Before that day and ever since, I've seen countless items I could have "needed" to sell for cash, but I've always seen them go to the people who need them.  Hell, even when I got a priest gem in velk's I ended up finding someone who needed it and I *gave* it to them.  Know why? Cause it's the goddamn right thing to do to help out the people around you.  If you're so into this game that you can't realize that then please do piss off.<br>

If you don't do NBG, I don't group with you, simple as that.<br>

<br>
Anyways, here is something to consider when an item drops.  Do I need it?  Not can I sell it or does that other person need it, but do I need it.  If the answer is no then you also have the answer to whether or not you should ask to be included on the item.<br>
<br>
The only exception being if no one in the group needs it.  Then woohoo, its your birthday.  <br>
<br>
Stop worrying about the other guy and take care of your own business.  If some scrotal wart wants to take on the karma of lying to the group and claiming an item he doesnt need, let him.  When you are so pathetic you have to tell lies on a video game,  you can be rest assured the master plan for your life includes repeating the phrase &quot;regular or unleaded&quot; a lot.<br>

Even if you are a welfare cheating, tax dodging, wife beating inbreeder in real life, you can rise above that in EQ.  I trust people to at least pretend they have an ounce of self respect.<br>

Aside from any other arguments against NBG itself, this is an uninformed statement, seeing as all zones are either 1) well-camped, but are the same when it comes to melee/caster loot ratio (i.e. horrible for casters), 2) any place where there is more caster gear than melee gear is generally difficult to get a good pick-up group for, or 3) can't be done without fifty assorted level-60 people at your side.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> First of all NBG was designed to eliminate the sick trends that had developed in LGuk for over two years, where casters would walk out all day long with an FBSS and some poor monk or warrior would spend 30-60 plus hours before he even came close to winning a random. Nothing more frustrating than to be in on roll number 18 for a FBSS and see it go to UBER_NECRO001, then have him send you a tell saying &quot;Dude, you got 9k plat I will sell it to you?&quot;<br>

Again, aside from any anti-NBG argument, this is uninformed (see um.. the post from the pale wizzie in the red robe). But could someone explain to me how it is that casters magically seem to win every single random when everyone rolls? People throw this into their posts and expect someone's bad luck to be passed off as a valid argument. Oh, and I, personally, find it more frustrating to be surrounded by people who wail that you should &quot;do the right thing and go NBG&quot; without actually being able to give any sensible reason why it is the &quot;right thing.&quot; I do believe it is not as frustrating—losing by luck—as not even having a fair shot to begin with. (Quick anti-flame note: don't tell me to &quot;just stop grouping with those people.&quot; I already have. The fact that I don't personally have to face NBG's problems does not make its problems magically disappear.)<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Its a matter of fact that several classes becuase of their viability at the art or soloing can generate much more cash than most melee classes at higher levels if they want to spend the time.

Even if this was true, it's irrelevant to the loot rules argument. But since you wrote it, on this level, compare the things a caster can easily solo to the stuff one can get in a group. What happens to the easily-solo'd items is they are so easy to get that they become de-valued relatively quickly. If I was out to strike it rich, I'd take some friends to Howling Stones rather than spend an entire night competing with others at an overly camped area, and hoping I get lucky enough to 1) pull the mob that drops the special item and 2) get the one out of 20 that actually drops said item.<br>

So what you are saying is that NBG does <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> not</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> favor the cheaters, and that randoming to all does? You are afraid of someone &quot;ganking an item they have no need for and then trying to gouge the prices on it against someones meager bank role&quot;? (Translated, this means: &quot;winning an item that my arbitrary version of 'need' does not qualify you for&quot;) And, are you telling me that someone who assertively and actively seeks to become more useful as a character (by getting items) is stealing items from others when he wins a full random? And you mean that someone who's not even willing to state that he wants items should be rewarded by being allowed to swipe the item from everyone else who helped get the item in the first place?<br>
<br>
It strikes me as odd that anyone can be dense enough to so boldly state that it is greedy to give everyone in the group (e.g. everyone who helped earn this item) an equal chance, and that denying people from rolling on items they helped get is &quot;honorable&quot; and right.<br>

If you are an intelligence caster who is all about the loot (and man are you gonna be disappointed at higher levels if so), then don't live in OS from pickup group to pickup group -- form a regular hunting group of people you trust not to abuse NBG, and the group can spend time in OS, but also visit the Hole and places where stuff you want drops.<br>
<br>
<br>
I did want to respond to one statement in here that jumped out to me because it's not an example of &quot;NBG&quot; policy --<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;And need is so arbitrary... I need those Fire Opals that drop for my jewelcrafting as much as the Clerics do for gems... I'd like to at least split them or roll. It's not as if I can buy Fire Opals from a merchant.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
In case you hadn't figured this out, lower-level gems to clerics has nothing to do with NBG; it's reimbursing someone for spending money from their own pocket to keep symbols on the group, hopefully to keep you alive and fighting and gaining xp more than you are dead and losing xp.  If you don't like reimbursing clerics for their peridots, either stop accepting symbol and die more often (and you will, you're an enchanter), or carry stacks of peridots and hand them to the cleric, then roll on the fire opals to your heart's content.<br>
<br>
And fwiw, there is a source of fire opals in the game if you need them -- talk to Genni in Temple of Sol Ro.<br>

All of you that support Pharm rules seem to have this warped idea that every item won in NBG is then taken straight to EC and auctioned while the owner gets the same item off his twink to wear.  This is about as far from the truth as you can get.  Unless you surrounde yourself with lowlifes, or spend all of your times in random PU groups then you should never see this.<br>
<br>
And so what?  You do see a caster auctioning a BC robe in EC when you know he just won it.  Just put his ass on Scammers and go on with it. Big deal, at least you were more honorable in group than some of the silly shit I've seen go on in groups when nice loot drops and Pharm rules are on.<br>
<br>
I think my point is this..If you want to Pharm...by all means do so..just make sure you surround yourself with the same caliber of people when you do so..so that no one will complain when you get burnt by bums.<br>
<br>
And as for the caster/melee item arguement..heh thats a lost cause.  Melee items are VERY exspensive compared to even the highest end caster items.  Why?  Becuase for so long in the past they were almost always Pharmed or won only by casters in caster heavy groups who then overcharged any tank who wanted them.  Not hard to figure out here..just compare price on BC robe to Fungi tunic and you will see what I mean..both have very similar drop rate so they should be the same right..WRONG.  The one for the Monk is muuuuch more expensive.<br>
<br>
Anywhoo...its not really that important Triff, cause I think all it means is that if you and I were to get thrown into a group together..one of us would leave cause we would not like the loot rules.  Nothing personal..just a difference in opinion.<br>
<br>
Best way to solve all of this.  Get a guild you can trust and get out ot PU groups..since they frankly suck ass for this threads very reason.<br>

<br>
Poppen, usually I respect your reasoning even when I disagree with you, but that's just an idiotic thing to say.  Prices are set by supply and demand.  There is a *lot* more demand for melee items than for most caster items because meleers rely on equipment a lot more.  There is also a relatively large supply of int caster items, even at the high end.<br>
<br>
Let's use your example.  There is a tremendous demand for fungi tunics from shaman, monks, and pullers in general.  There really are no substitute items, unless you count the Iksar regen BP, which monks cannot use.  The fungi tunic drops in a difficult camp on the lower level of OS that has a tradition of spectacular CRs.  High demand + low supply = high price.<br>

By contrast, although the Bonecaster robe is very nice, and most int casters would like to have one, there just isn't the same level of demand.  I've never had an int caster say, &quot;let's go to D1 and camp Gruplinort!&quot;  A big part of the reason for the lack of the demand is the fact that there *are* substitutes for a Bonecaster robe, most obviously the SMR.  Maybe the Bonecaster robe is better, but most casters just don't obsess about equipment the same way that meleers do, which means that there is less demand.  Moderate demand + moderate supply (taking into account substitutes) = moderate price.<br>
<br>
So don't give us this crap about a cartel of casters who are out to gouge tanks.  That's a load of bullshit, and you're smarter than that.<br>

Even better, trade periodots to the cleric for fire opals.  Periodots cost me about 12.5 pp in FV, and I get about 40 pp per fire opal.  Most clerics will be happy to cut a deal with you, as long as they wind up breaking even on their periodot costs.  (Yeah, there are some clerics who try to make a big profit on gems, but every class has it's share of scumbags.)<br>

Well, that's some serious bullshit.  Like it or not, loot is a big part of the game, and it is a motivating factor for most players.  Try taking a group to Skyfire sometime, and see how long it takes before someone asks, &quot;Does anything ever drop here?&quot;  When Verant wanted to encourage more people to go to VL instead of OS, what did they do?  They improved the loot.<br>
<br>
Maybe your values are different, Ramierez.  That's cool.  Frankly, I care a lot less about loot than the average player, and I'm probably closer to your viewpoint than most people.  However, the notion that loot is just a &quot;bonus&quot; would be pretty alien to most of the players on this server.<br>

Because you lost the right to roll on an item that was worth 40k or so.  Duh.  Of course that hurts you.  Maybe the greater good is served by giving it to the poor shaman (which is why I still support NBG), but don't kid yourself that the other people aren't making a sacrifice. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ulelliannalebeau.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lellianna LeBeau</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 13<br> <font color=#E9D756>(7/27/01 6:52:31 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: NBG... how is this fair?</span><hr size=1> Quote: by Sharmila<br>

In case you hadn't figured this out, lower-level gems to clerics has nothing to do with NBG; it's reimbursing someone for spending money from their own pocket to keep symbols on the group, hopefully to keep you alive and fighting and gaining xp more than you are dead and losing xp. If you don't like reimbursing clerics for their peridots, either stop accepting symbol and die more often (and you will, you're an enchanter), or carry stacks of peridots and hand them to the cleric, then roll on the fire opals to your heart's content.<br>
<br>
And fwiw, there is a source of fire opals in the game if you need them -- talk to Genni in Temple of Sol Ro.<br>

First, I've always been happy to give Clerics every gem that drops that can be bought from a merchant (Sapphires, Rubies, Star Rubies, et cetera).  I'm asking why Fire Opals are different from Black Sapphires and Jacinths that we all roll on.<br>
<br>
Second, I've been in many groups with Druids healing, and they don't get symbols.  Funny, the Druid healers let me die far less often.  Symbols make the Cleric's job easier 90% of the time; they're not required to keep me alive.<br>
<br>
Third, I've never had anyone send me to see Genni before, but if I can acquire Fire Opals that way, I'll gladly withdrawl my objection to Fire Opals being given to the Cleric without rolls. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showMessageRange?topicID=2182.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a> <b>2</b> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showMessageRange?topicID=2182.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showMessageRange?topicID=2182.topic&start=61&stop=80>4</a><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showMessageRange?topicID=2182.topic&start=81&stop=100>5</a><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showMessageRange?topicID=2182.topic&start=101&stop=120>6</a><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showMessageRange?topicID=2182.topic&start=121&stop=121>7</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showMessage?topicID=2057.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showMessage?topicID=2548.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.emailToFriend?topicID=2182.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.threadControl?topicID=2182.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/deleteThreadFire.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=2182.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=2182.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub4.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="emarrmessageboardrules">Message Board Rules<option value="emarrlinks">Links<option value="emarrupcomingmmorpgs">Upcoming MMOG's<option value="emarrfrm16">The Emarr Quadrant<option value="emarrfrm18">America Under Attack<option value="emarrfrm19">Dark Age of Camelot<option value="emarrgeneral">General<option value="emarrfrm17">Funny Stuff<option value="emarrbazaar">Item Bazaar<option value="emarrscrollsnspells">Spell Bazaar<option value="emarrfrm15">Shiny Things<option value="emarrfrm14">Bargain Basement<option value="emarrdragonsandplanes">Rants and Flames<option value="emarrfrm13">Dragons and Planes<option value="emarrroleplaying">Roleplaying<option value="emarrroleplayingoocforum">Roleplaying - OOC Forum<option value="emarrscammeralert">Scammer Alert<option value="emarrsignaturecorner">Test Forum<option value="emarrreallife">Real Life<option value="emarrothermmorpgs">Other MMOG's</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#E9D756>- </font><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/bemarr>Erollisi Marr, The Queen of Love</a><font color=#E9D756> - </font><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes>Rants and Flames</a> <font color=#E9D756> - </font><br><br> <br>
