I apologize if I offended you.  That certainly was not my intention.  But, I think if you went back, you would see that you may have misunderstood what I was trying to say, and the comparison I was giving.<br>
<br>
Killing innocent people is not right.  I agree.  I believe I said that in my previous post.  It also is not right to stand by and let our innocent civilians die in vain.  I feel that if we do NOT retaliate, it leaves the door wide open for this to happen again.  We cannot allow that.<br>

<br>
If you read multiple history books, instead of just the one you read in 8th grade history you'd be a little more edumacated yourself. There are many supports to the claim that we knew Pearl Harbor was comming. FDR was looking for a way to enter into the war, but the American people didnt want to. If you read deeper you find subtle clues, Pearl Harbor housed alot of our nautical forces, most of them being old. However, Pearl Harbor also had 2 brand new aircraft carriers/destroyers. These 2 multi-million(maybe billion?) ships were out of the harbor that day, both of them just randomly gone. I wonder why. Beyond that, the base personal had received orders to clean the all boats and planes that day, an activity that normally was spread out over a monthly cycle, not all done in 1 day. So we have the big expensive ships away for the day, and the planes and boats not being highly mobile when the attack first comes.  Wow sounds tottaly coincidental to me.<br>
<br>
As per black helicopters flying around my house, I havent seen any yet. The last time I read the Constitution it still said that I could talk in public forums. I, however, cannot defame someone by lying, threaten someone, or commit a crime while doing so. It is perfectly legal for me to say what I have. Everyday there are groups of people preaching their hate in New York, San Francisco, and any other large city in America. They have not been &quot;arrested&quot; or &quot;squelched&quot; as many of you have asked Ogmuk to do me, so why should the FBI be knocking on my door? Is it because I said population control? You all assumed im even talking about the terrorism, isn't Everquest a form of population control? But now your going to flame me even more for the last sentence, and I care not. <br>

Killing Osama bin Laden...why don't we just supply the terrorists with the materials they need to stir even more chaos into our country. If we track down and kill bin Laden, what then? His followers will not disband, they will step up and fight back even more. His defence budget is second only to America, he has power. And once we kill him, one of his followers will step up and lead his group. The only problem here is that historically, the person who leads seconds is more of a fanatic than the original. The other problem is that his followers are spread throughout the world. Unlike in convential warfare, the enemy here isnt in a centralized location. There is no building in that says &quot;Osama bin Laden's Headquarters&quot;. Finding each of his agents around the world and keeping them from each bombing something American would be impossible. <br>

Whether it is true, I don't know, but this is the theory.  As for Mors, go to hell and I hope Satan treats you like his bitch; you aren't worth any more tactful response than that.  <br>
<br>
Umbrae - No more than 1 week ago President Bush warned Afghanistan outright that IF Bin Laden was responsible for an attack on the country we would not only hold him responsible, but we would hold ALL OF AFGHANISTAN responsible because they were harboring him.  This warning was in response to the fact that they would not turn over Bin Laden after he VERY PUBLICLY said that <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> &quot;American Blood will be spilled&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.  We warned them, lets back up that warning if it IS Bin Laden.  I'm not one for making a threat and not backing it up.  So in answer to your question, hell yes it makes sense, we gave them the warning, screw them if they had something to do with it.  <br>
<br>
Mors/Ibriar - NATO has declared that if this was an attack by members outside the U.S. then it was not only an <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> ACT OF WAR</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> against the U.S., but also against all of NATO.  In case you're brain can't comprehend this, that means that the entire world will unite in completely nuking these dumb fucks back into the Stone Age.  Make no mistake, there WILL be retaliation, and IT IS ALREADY WAR.  These cowardly bastards declared it, and we WILL end it.  <br>
<br>
Lastly, if you think in any way that OUR GOVERNMENT was involved in this terrorist attack, then you have a lower IQ than the jackasses who flew those planes into the buildings and killed tens of thousands of innocent people, whose only crime was showing up for work on time, believing that it would get them into Heaven.  I honestly pray that God brings you the intelligence to truly see what has happened, heal you of your psychosis, and bring you some level of sympathy for the poor people who have been affected by these cowardly and heinous attacks.<br>

Clearly, that is the source of your &quot;information.&quot;<br>
<br>
Bin Laden's defense budget is second only to ours?  That's rich.  You don't have a clue.  His financial resources have been quite well documented at approximately $200 million, five years ago.  He's spent a lot since then, and doesn't have anything invested anywhere but Afghanistan.  If you think that $200 million is more than a drop in the bucket for dozens and dozens of our allies, then you are absolutely clueless.<br>

<br>
All I am defending here is the unwarrented accusation that Mors and VenomsLust/Ibiar are the same person. They are not.

Would I defend you were the circumstances reversed? yes. I abhor witchhunts.<br>

Mors is not Ibiar.  Although Ibiar's post does not reflect my feelings nor my guild's feelings, we live in a country where people are free to express our opinions.  That is one thing that makes this a great country.<br>
<br>
If you feel that people should not be able to express their feelings freely, maybe you should leave the country and go somewhere else and let us enjoy OUR freedom.<br>
<br>
I cannot believe this has gone on so long.  The immaturity here astounds me.  I am through reading this post, I just wanted everyone to know that our guild is not one collective that shares one opinion.  We all think differently.  We all have minds of our own.<br>
<br>
Thank you,<br>

There has been a rash of anonymous flames, was well as anonymous supporting posts of others.  I'm not the only one that suggested the use of pseudonyms of either Mors/Ibriar or Chiteng/ksarul.  Go ahead and claim that it's just me, but you'd be wrong.<br>
<br>
I'm real happy you guys aren't all clones.  Fine.  There's plenty of room for disagreement on a lot of things.  Whether the killing of several thousand people was justified is not one of them.  If you want to continue to associate with someone like that (and like it or not, you are judged by the company you keep), then that's your problem.  I would assume that most folks would prefer not to group with Ibriar any longer, or anyone that would justify and rationalize his crude and offensive statements.<br>
<br>
Sure, he's got a right to be an ass.  Not around this board as there are rules and Freedom of Speech means nothing on a private board.  Mind you, I've not advocated the banning of Mors because of what he said (although that's clearly a violation of posting policy), but the chickenshit manner in which he did it by his anonymity.<br>
<br>
Zendell:  I think the comment was fair and accurate.  I posted on your guild board that Ibriar was embarrassing you guys on this board (later noticed I forgot to mention what board, but one of your sharper members figured out how to track it down).  Several of you then march over here and support him, without regard or mention of what he said.  That is foolish and my comment stands.<br>
<br>
I agree with you that the immaturity of Mors and Ibriar is astounding.  Regardless of whether Mors is Ibriar (and you've no evidence to the contrary), the point is that Ibriar basically stated the same thing that Mors did, although in much more detail.  He admitted making the &quot;population control&quot; comments in game.  Whether he's the same person or just someone else that believes the same fucked up things is immaterial.  &quot;Ibriar's&quot; comments are an embarassment to you, or at least should be.  He's beneath contempt, and you guys are nuts if you continue to permit him to be an example of your guild. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/umors.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mors</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=" http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif " BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 8<br> <font color=#E9D756>(9/13/01 12:09:36 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=139.topic&index=73>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: population control</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>

Although the family fortune is estimated in the many dozens of billions, his own personal share was made and cut-off around the time of the Gulf War.  He is persona non grata in Saudi Arabia and his family has made efforts to reacquire his financial resources.<br>

3.  Nope.  Not a public forum.  It's run by EZBoard and Ogmuk.  This isn't the steps of the capital or a shopping mall.

Sure, there's no law to keep you from doing so, there's also no law permitting you to do so.

You not only continue to accuse me of being Mors, but you needlessly come to my Guild's message boards and flame me AND Umbrae. You now Flame Emberial and Zendell, who have probably been the most civil in this thread. Zendell and Emberial, if you can read, were not defending my opinions. As stated by Emberial, they were simply stating that I am not Mors. I know everyone else in my guild were deeply saddened by the events. And had you done more than grab a random thread on our boards, you would realise this.<br>
<br>
Here's the deal :<br>
1) I am NOT Mors. Had I the inclination to post something here, I would do it under my own Login. <br>
2) My name is Ibiar, not Ibriar.<br>
3) My feelings on the events that occured do not reflect anyone but me.<br>
4) The ONLY reason I posted here at all, is because of the /tells I was getting in game. I came here to clairify that I AM NOT MORS. Under ANY message board that I sign up for, I sign up as VenomsLust, Always have and will always continue to.<br>
5) Yes, you have every right to think of me as a &quot;sick fuck&quot;, or whatever that will change to.<br>
6) Yes, I can be crass, cold, and seemingly unemotional at times. But, anyone that has been around me for more than a few piddly posts, will know that I will do alot for others when they need help.<br>
<br>
To anyone else, please reread my posts. As I stated, I do NOT condone or take enjoyment out of the events. But I am not as heart-struck as most people will be. In tense situations, I will generally try to &quot;lighten&quot; the mood. My statement in DL (not EC) in /ooc chat WAS inappropiate. And to those that were present when I said it, please accept my appology if you took offense to it.<br>
<br>
So, I ask that you please leave my guild out of this, and cease this witch-hunt on my name. <p><center>

Let's put it like this:  you go to this new restaurant and order a steak.  Turns out it's the best thing you've put in your mouth.  You tell all your friends &quot;Hey man, you have GOT to try this new place out, they serve the best steak!&quot;  And of course your friends say, &quot;Hey man, don't tell me where I have to eat!&quot;<br>
Same way with Christians pretty much.  They have found something that has made their life whole and they want others to know about it.  No one is forcing you to read/hear what they have to say.<br>
I know I know, it's a crude example, but you get my meaning.  Not a flame, but an explanation.<br>
<br>
Now, more on the subject.  Do you really think we wouldn't have gone to war if the Japanese had bombed our soil and no one was there?  There is no reason at all for them not to evacuate Pearl Harbor if they had known of the attack.<br>
