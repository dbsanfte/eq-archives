As I recall, around four months ago Saudi Arabi cut oil production significantly because oil and gas prices were &quot;too low&quot;. Recent reports have mentioned that prices on priemum could reach $2.00 a gallon by summer. <br><br> Will the media use the change is gasoline prices as justification for attacking Iraq? Let's face it, when gasoline prices increase, anti-arab setiment could also increase as a consequence ( a good portion of the world oil comes from Saudi Arabia, Kuait, and Russia which all have significant Muslim/Arab populations). <br><br> Is it &quot;easier&quot; to conduct a war in Iraq when gasoline prices are inflated?

As it stands both parties aim for the mushball middle to the public and play their partisan games on the sides. During the last debates it seemed Gore and Bush agreed more than disagreed. With a third or fourth guy(or gal) in there we will see issues brought up that are ignored because of sensitivity to the masses. I think we are all grown ups and can handle a little truth. Is that even possible anymore? I watched the lesser third party debates that were sponsored by Jesse Ventura in Minnesotta. Neither Nader nor Buchannon(sp?) were there, but the ones who were there put on a good debate but seriously a couple of them were from off their rocker and staring up at the blur of the ceiling fan. <br><br>Ritt<br><br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ulurikeen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lurikeen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 428<br> <font color=#E9D756>(3/17/02 10:56:54 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=288.topic&index=3>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Gas Prices and the War on Iraq round 2</span><hr size=1> Don't be surprised if Perot gets back into the Presidential race.

He can only say that he gave a large tax break. He can't say, as Clinton could, that the economy is at an all time high. Indeed, since Bush has taken office the economy sucks. Even if we blame Clinton for the bad economy, Bush is sure to be blamed for not bringing the US out of it, but burying it deeper under the mire of bad foreign policy. <p>Lurikeen Mali'Kyre<BR>Necromancer <BR>Proud Member of The Disciples of Truth</a><BR><BR>"My eyes will pierce your soul, then I will take your life!"<br></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ubizzo.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bizzo</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 169<br> <font color=#E9D756>(3/18/02 9:05:36 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=288.topic&index=4>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Gas Prices and the War on Iraq round 2</span><hr size=1> From what Bush is selling us (increasingly more recently) it seems like he has evidence Iraq has more credibly built up chemical weapons and a higher possibility they'll use 'em on us.

Just because someone is elected into office or appointed to a position by his college buddy, does not mean he is &quot;enlightened&quot; into what is &quot;reality&quot;, what is &quot;morality&quot;, and the correct courses of action for dealing with world events. There is no objective reality, there are only subjective opinions.<br><br>  When reading anyones commentary it is important to take into consideration what their stance/orientation is Bizzo. From your post I assert that you are either a Republican, or a conservative independent, therefore, I take you opinions in the context they were given.<br> <br>  First, Iraq is not developing a chemical weapons program, Hussane used chemical weapons on his own people prior to the Gulf War. Therefore, building up is an inadequate word, as they &quot;have had&quot;. Secondly, there is a difference between possessing a weapon of mass distruction, and using it. If Hussane wanted to use chemical weapons against the United States he would have done so already.<br><br>  Lastly, as taxpayers to the United States government I believe that we have every right to critise our government when we do not agree with their policies, and or fail to protect us from invasion or terriorist attacks. <br><br>  In my opinion, I think that the united states government approves of people like you Bizzo. That is, the ones who don't ask questions and hold them accountable for their actions. Conformist little lambs who assume the soverignity and knowledge of a power who mailed Mohammad Atta's, a terrorist leader who executed a plot to pilot that killed over 3,000 people, and personally drove an airplane into a one-hundred plus story building effectively knocking it to the groud, a student-pilot Visa extension form with the connotation &quot;enjoy your stay in the US Mr. Atta&quot;. <br><br>  Do I know as much as the goverment knows? <br>I think the above example exemplifies about how much the United States governmet knows.

If you voted in the election that saw George Bush elected then you're the largest, most significant, and most horrific part of the problem.<br><br>The public...you know, the people who are supposed to RUN the country...had absolutely no choice in the election. Those of you who voted think you made a decision. Choosing between two corrupt assholes with no more agenda than to increase their cash holdings and decrease the average intelligence of the citizens is not any real sort of decision.<br><br>The representatives are supposed to live among us and carry our words and thoughts to the highest order. As Americans, we are supposed to control the country...we are America. Our representatives should be echoing you and I on their occasional visits to D.C. and the country should be governed on popular opinion.<br><br>Congratulations, fellow Americans. We've given up our voice to the very representatives that are supposed to work FOR us. Now they tell us what to think, who we can and can't vote for, and what our country will do.<br><br>This is the most powerful country on the planet, but that absolutely will not last forever. I refuse to believe that freedom can be perpetuated in a manner such as this. We are without many of our original freedoms already and we're gaining no ground. If we're not heading toward another civil war then we may as well give up now. How many of you have actually read the Constitution? If it's a living document as the government claims then pretty much every politician in the country is in the wrong and must be charged immediately. If that does not happen immediately, the only course of thought possible is that the Constitution is a dead document. If the Constitution is a dead document, we are no longer the United States of America.

They are supossed to vote in accordance witht he people but that is NOT manditory.  With all the technology we have its a @#%$ of bullsh!t.  <br><br>Lets say, for example, California has 40 million people.  Lets pretend they can all vote.  Now lets say there are 260 milllion other voters in the USA.  Divided up into 49 other states of course.  (lets keep this basic)  Ok now say that there was only 1 vote difference with the other states.  It was very close.  130,000,001 people voted for Republican and 129,999,999 voted for Democrat.  With the electoral college voting as the people did, all of those states voted for Republican. Now in California, all 40 million voters vote for Democrat.  So thats 169,999,999 votes to 130,000,001.  Republican victory by -almost 40 million votes.  What a dumbass system.  While that is an extreme example, the system obviously needs to be changed. <br><br>  It should also be the governments job to equally display information about all candidates.  In a resume type of format.  Each candidate would enter their information, qualifications and 'dreams' fo the country.  It should be much easier for the citizen to vote and know who the hell they are voting for.  Politicians love for the citizen to be confused.  They love for the average Joe not to vote.  They only want to sell themselves to the people(lobbyists) who already vote.  <br><br>IMO, taxpayer money should be used to finance campaigns.  Not the prelim campaigns, but the second round(whatever that is called)  The prelim's should have to be financed by themselves.  If there is a 10% or more vote count, they should be allowed to campain on taxpayer money.  There should also be a format for advertising which creates an equal playing field for presidential campainers.  Do you think the republicans and democrats want Jesse 'The Body' Ventura to run for office?  HELL NO!!  He would probably actually do what the people wanted.  Corporations would be outraged, lobbyists(who probably get 100 time the voting power) would go bonkers.  The people in control would lose control and they don't want that.

Do you honestly think that the big oil companies WANT a vehicle that can do 60+mpg? They love the SUVs and so do I! The good thing in America is that if you can afford to buy a SUV and put gas in it...smile <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br>Destroying the earth with SUVs? Lol!  We need some new 'causes'... these are getting old. Tell ya what.. i'll make you a promise ... When the gas starts to get very hard to come by and expensive, you will then have cars that get 60+mpg. When all the gas is gone, you will have new hydro-electric cars (or some alternative).<br><br>Oil is old and out-dated! So, go buy a SUV so we can use up all the oil in the world and move on to newer better things.<br><br>Driving a SUV = Advancement in transportation technology<br><br><br>P.S.
