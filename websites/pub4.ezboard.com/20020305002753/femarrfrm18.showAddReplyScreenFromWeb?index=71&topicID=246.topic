Time was for me an arbitrary "X" that obtained a meaning from relation between terms like "matter", "space", "motion" and perception (or conscious thinking). <br>
I couldn't accept that derivitation because reality didn't consistently plot a point along "Now" that gave a ratio measuring the "Instantaneous Rate of Change" of total "Now" for the Universe... *cough* it always corresponded with a "Then" which automatically limited the usefullness of my comparative data.<br>
<br>
Time as a "Now" of discrete duration (or Period) actually worked for any given "X" of intervals spanning "Now" and I saw that if I continued from the average instance of my "Now" to a succeeding interval of "Now" I remained in the state of "Now" time consistently. This "Now" I bound in proper motion and gave direction with my extension of time through space. I realised the inherent order of "X" progression meant a time-count sequence separable from the count of the total number in a queue. There was time without human order, classification or category maintaining the inner-reality... the system even sustained recorded human thought maintainable outside its inner "Now" state, and I communicate that with this post.<br>

<br>
Interestingly enough any talk of "now" with regard to time presupposes a state events having duration... in other words, a previous state of affairs (or past) leading to the present or "now". Talk of a "eternal now" is rather senseless. My typing the word "senseless" invokes in us a perception of the progression of time.<br>
<br>
Furthermore, events in time are asymmetrical. My wife's giving birth at t1 and my son's 1st birthday at t2 cannot be reversed in order. The relationship between both events are asymmetric. It is also hard to see if such asymmetry is relative. Is there a possible world in which my son can have a first birthday prior to the event of my wife giving birth to him? Absurd? I would rather say that the interval of time is not absolute; that due in part because time is a matter of perception. Any talk of "time" and "space" without observers usually leads to nonsensical statements. For instance, how is time quantified without an observer? Or space for that matter? Once an equation is provided it is a simple step to ask just where the observer fits into the formulation of the logic of the equation. These are the sorts of problems that Quantum Physicists are now coming to terms with. They are realizing that measurements at a subpartical level are very much dependent upon observers. In short, what Einstein had to say over and over again concerning relativity is ringing true even at a quanta level. Again, some very interesting points you raise. :) <p>Lurikeen Mali'Kyre<BR>

So let me tell you what I mean about the logic science statement.  Logic and science are a tool to understand the world around us.  Agree?  I think most do.  Does that mean that scientists have zero feeling or desire ?  NO it doesn't.  Sometimes people make generalizations so it is easier and LESS boring for someone to read their posts.  I made a statement declaring that science is EXTREMELY important as well.  Obviously, I feel that scientists are motivated by feeling.  Scientific thought is the pursuit of truth.  What I am concerned with is todays logic/science based thought which is so strong that people have to have a number orpicture flashed in front of their face in order to believe something.  Its a phase our society is going through.  What don't you understand Rheaton?  Do you honestly think I'm anti-science?  OF course Einstein and Edison had a HUGE amount of feeling and desire in order to obtain their discoveries.  Sorry that I am irritated but it seems the more and more I post on this board people focus more on refuting what other people say rather than offering their own ideas.<br>

I wanted it to read out in the case one observer perceives time as a manmade construct. I started from there with the one premise I could postulate but I could not follow the journey through. My post "sorta stumbles around" (insert an "it" in front of that phrase excerpt) I don't imply that you're doing the same. Clearly, I can't hold the same position as you over the subject of time, I tried to pin that down with my post. I tried to refine my arguement dialectically through the very process of "seeing" time from a reasonable postulate, which had to be done. Finally, I roughed in a conclusion and left my gem uncut as it was found. For instance, I didn't expand my observation of the member count in a queue (queues possessing the distinct property of shuffling elements - "pipelining" for a better word) counting a different sequence still not changing the count of its number of elements(members?). I would have had to reword and re-write the paragraph, not a huge task, but I was very tired. Too tired to administer some damage avoidance cushioning until after I had slept. Note the post is not "angry" or pointedly malign and see I purposed no harm... it's just a journey in time. <br>

When I read what Brutas has to say about time I think he is expressing Kantian ideas (to a great extent) that are very respectable. For instance, the Kantian idea that we can't see a thing in itself; compare to Brutas' &quot;WHAT we see is not what is only 'there'&quot;. Such also follows Kant's ideas over transcedentalism. In a nut shell, the mind determines temporal/spatial characteristics of percieved objects. So, giving Brutas a &quot;half-serious&quot; response just isn't cool my friend. I am sorry if we are a bit under your league, Misty (which I doubt) but please at least provide us with YOUR reasons if you intend to give a genuine response to a post. You don't have to do that Misty, but it is much more fun. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Even if it is a heart felt flame, let it fly!

Brutas, in a very real sense, we do &quot;stumble... looking outwardly&quot; for our answers to &quot;Big Life&quot; questions or even obscure questions over metaphysics, like &quot;What is 'Time'?&quot;. However, I think it odd to speak in terms of &quot;inner&quot; and &quot;outer&quot;, since in order to talk like that we must bring along multitudes of suit cases chalk full of metaphysical garbage. Yet, don't we all carry around such luggage? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Reminds me of a scripture in which Jesus says that we must become like little children to enter into the kingdom of his god.

First off, Brutas, I would like to apologize for using your statements as a basis for my points. In no way was I trying to refute nor object to your feelings on the subject of science. Also, I must admit that my knowledgeable references and credentials on the subject of Time is somewhat limited.<br>
<br>
Brutas, if you will extend me the gratitude once again in allowing me to quoth thee, I shall attempt to regurgitate my thoughts on science and religion.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  1.) Brutas: &quot;But the funny thing about science and logic is that it is all based on facts which are 'known'. Its limitation is within its design.&quot; <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> I must admit that I did interpret you as meaning science itself or rather the overall vehicle of science.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  2.) Brutas:  “…todays logic/science based thought which is so strong that people have to have a number or picture flashed in front of their face in order to believe something” <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> But I see that you are talking about people and how they have manipulated the essence of science.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  3.) Brutas: I'm only opposing science because it is the trend in todays world as religion was 500 years ago. IMO, scientists don't dictate what reality is or even what is possible. ……… I think science is wonderful and in fact I believe that science will be an important aspect in the 'Afterlife'. I think that science is half of the adventure of life. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> Your point was received, understood and considered. <br>
<br>
I do feel as though you have indeed captured the sentiments of many individuals from around the globe. However, my ideals do vary somewhat in regards to “..its design”. I feel as though the design or rules of engagement if you will, greatly depend upon the individual. Many people that I speak with on a daily basis are either hostile towards science or hostile towards religion. It seems very difficult to find any sort of happy medium between the two. Typically, those who subscribe to the theory that we evolved from apes are typically those who believe and feel that religion is nothing more then a cling to ignorance. Transversely, those of a higher level of religion tend to see science as a “tool of the devil”, constantly attempting to disprove God. My above post is at best a poor illustration of an attempt to show how the two can co-exist…..how they already co-exist. For one to reject the notion of God because of ‘lack of factual data’ is, IMO, the opposite ignorance of “science is only a tool of the devil”.<br>
<br>
I do agree that science is a very important tool in the dream of longevity, technology, and “better living”. I am currently sitting in and surrounded by many scientific “marvels”. They do indeed provide comfort, ease, several varied methods to extend my life, and a scratch on my curious ‘itches’. But what has it done for me…the inter me, the part of me that thinks, feels, loves, dreams and hopes? Absolutely nothing. I don’t know about the rest of you, but believing in a greater power, a God and a eternal love, rather true or false, is much more rewarding then any scientific proof or factual data that exist. I know that there are many people who would say “well, if you prefer to live in a fantasy world then be my guest”. ..and I shall. But I must point out to those whom do not believe in a higher power that their single-minded science has yet to provide them with any closure. I honestly do not care if science attempts to prove or disprove the existence of God just as long as they do not discredit the possibility that He does exist.<br>
<br>
Again, it is not my intentions to critique nor argue someone own point of view. I was merely using previously posted statements to launch my own Pov. <br>

I'm sorry I took it the wrong way <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Much respect Lurikeen/the man in the middle, who rather than return the crossfire, decided to present a common ground.  <br>
  Rheaton it doesn't matter if you have read any philosophical material.  Your curiosity justifies anything you want to express.  In fact, I am glad that Lurikeen brought up the Jesus quote and the philosopher, Kant.  I have heard of Immanuel Kant and even bought his book &quot;the critique of pure reason&quot; but almost vomited out of boredom after reading the first page.I LOVE the Jesus quote because I have always felt that it is pertinent that we all obtain our innocence or find it once again.  I am passionate about this especially when it comes to school.  In school I have always disagreed with the education system in its so-called 'attempt' to better our citizens.  (This is not so far from the Jesus quote trust me)  I have always had average to bad grades.  My mother thought I was either learning disabled or possibly had a low IQ (not that IQ really matters anyway)  Anyway,  at the age of 8 my mother(a teacher in occupation) took me to the school board and asked that I take an IQ test.  I did and scored as gifted.  Many years later I took a psychology test which defines what type of learner you are.  I don't remember the actual names except the one I am bu they were as follows: The artsy fartsy type, the practical/organized logical type with a dash of conformity, the generalist/commons sense/abstract system oriented Joe/ And finally the value based learner/wisdom seeker.  I am mostly the value based with a touch of generalist.  Anyway, the value based learners do the worst in school(no shit I thought to myself), the practical do the best in school up till college where, because they is less to conform to, they lag a little behind the generalist who tend to be more independent and thus are able to handle the lack of coordination by the teacher.  The generalist does 2nd best in pre-college.  So every since then I have struggled to understand why teachers throw a book of info at you and expect you to become experts on it in a few months.  Well, this obviously is an attempt at conformity to the teachers ideals.  Its NOT 'real' learning.  It teaches people(for the most-part) to not be yourself.  I can go all day long on this shit so let me get to my point.  My point is that life is l ike a box of chocolates LOL just kidding.  My point is that life is about finding who you are and how you relate to the world around you(and the people in it and spirituality and all that crap too)  and people will never know who they 'really' are if they can't express themselves.  I have battled with others and my personality for a long time.  Dumb fukin employers who have Zero people skills but just so-happen to control the fate of 20,30 or even 100 people.  Poffessors(like at my school) who are experts in their subject arena but can't 'teach' worth a shit.  And students who get better grades than you because they write about the teachers ideas rather than their own because they know how the buracracy works.  Anyway, the biggest battle in life(IMO) is man versus man.  Anohter 'man' steals the inocence form another.  You live constantly guarding your 'self' and then realize by doing so you are losing your innocence.   Most importantly, the disgusting fuks that ruin a potential relationship with God for other people by doing the dumbest shit and claiming it in the name of God.  I am a values-based learner, please believe me when I say that I know EXACTLY what you mean when you wrote that quote.  Another thing that brings me back to the &quot;do you believe in God&quot; forum; it goes to show that you don't have to read the bible or go to church or pray a certain way in order to have a relationship with God.  I don't do the above and I have realize that its crucially important to retain your innocence.  I have learned/realized so many things that are said in the bible.  Thats the only reason I believe in some of the bible.  (obviously other passages in the bible aren't meant to be taken literally)  <br>
     Damn I'm sorry if that was excessive.  I might have given you ADD(attention defecit disorder) with that load of shit <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I hope i didn't miss any apologoes.

<br>
First of all, some very good stuff in your post above. <br>
<br>
I graduated from the University of Washington with a BA in Political Science. I nearly completed a second BA in Philosophy but exited the university rather than complete the 5 credits needed. :P I now work as an Engineer developing software to deploy webservers. I do a lot of script writing and Systems Engineering work! I found that there wasn't much of a future for a Philosopher in this world! At least not a financially secure one. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
At any rate, I can recommend taking any and all Deductive Reasoning courses you can find. Also take as many courses in Metaphysics and Epistemology offered by your college. Other than that read all that you can stand. Kant, while dry reading, is a good start. Try books authored by David Hume, Leibnitz, Descartes, Wittgenstein. You might even read contemporary works by Hilary Putnam (he is very good), WVO Quine, Donald Davidson, Richard Swinburne. Do a search at Amazon.com on the above authors.<br>
<br>
I can recommend trying to find compilations devoted to single philosophical topics. &quot;Reality in Focus&quot; is a great book dealing with issues concerning &quot;reality&quot; (metaphysics). Maybe others here can make some recommendations, too? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Good Luck, Brutas. <p>Lurikeen Mali'Kyre<BR>

It can never be asserted that a preceding event is necessarily related to a succeeding one. This can apply equally to assertions regarding the subjectivity of continuing existence. Something you no longer see because you do not look at it does not necessarily mean the thing is non-existent as that would mean that the "something" had changed its existence of itself because you changed the direction of your gaze at it. <br>

The phenomenalist will agree that there is an objective world in some sense. After all, we do have experiences with something other than our own fertile imaginations. However, they will also point out that things such as color, sound, shape, hardness, etc. are internal to those having a sensory experience. So, when a tree falls in the forest it does fall. However, unless there is a being available to have sensory experiences there it makes no "sound". Sound is an internal phenomena experienced by those equiped to pick up certain vibrations. <br>
