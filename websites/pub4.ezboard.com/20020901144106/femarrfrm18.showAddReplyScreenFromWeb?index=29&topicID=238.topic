How is Bush the lesser of two evils?  I have stated numerous points that paint the republicans as the worse of the two covering a gamut of things and the only thing you come up with is; <br>
You either know enough about both of them to know why I say it or you are too stupid to reason with. Either way it is a waste of time to tell you.<br>
<br>
Its not as big a waste as saying Bill Clinton lied about sex and anyone who isn't appalled is a piece of shit in four different post so waste the time. Educate us. Some of us actually read whole posts<br>

Prosecute!</span><hr size=1> First off lets point out that wanting moral ethics in your country does not mean that you are perfect.  If I say that alcohol should be illegal and I go out and get drunk does that make me a hypocrite?  Maybe I am just a man with a problem, and seeing that problem don't want others to fall into it, or I just don't want alcohol to be so easy for me to get my hands on.  I don't drink, never have... just an example.<br>
<br>
The examples you cite are great.  If they happened then you are right and Bush is a hypocrite, but still comes down to me never saying he wasn't.<br>
<br>
Bush doesn't represent me real well, no candidate in office ever will.  Lets not confuse the issues here.  I am not comparing presidents other than George and Bill.  I don't care if Abraham Lincoln was screwing his secret ring of enslaved harlots... well I do inasmuch as it relates to the morality and pride of the nation.  <br>
<br>
To me a man stands on his own merits... not what his father did or did not do, and certainly not compared to other men.  Clinton wasn't as bas as so and so, so we should just accept the stupid things he did do??  That’s a pretty great way to do things huh?<br>
<br>
<br>
George Bush has his issues, most of which I am probably not aware because I usually don't delve to deep into politics, if it doesn't make the headlines I probably don't see it. The thing about George is that I think he is mostly sincere.  I am not talking about his foreign policies, or his tax cuts... I am saying that I think he means what he says and really wants what’s best for everyone.  Pause here and remember I don't think he's perfect.<br>
<br>
Bill, on the other hand, strikes me as an opportunist.  He always looks like he is hiding something.  He always seems like he is looking out for himself.  When he speaks you can almost see in his eyes that he is thinking something else.  I am a pretty good judge of people, always have been (pause here to remember I didn't say I am always right), and he just always rubbed me wrong.<br>
<br>
I won't support Bush just because he is Republican.  I won't rag on Clinton because he is Democrat.  Parties mean nothing to me... except a reference point that I as a conservative person will most likely agree with a republican on a matter that is important to me.  That is a generalization though as there are some democrats that are more conservative than some republicans.  I didn't vote for Bush in the elections, I voted against Gore by pressing the button for Bush.<br>
<br>
I am not really aware of the stereotypes of the two parties.  I forget - as a republican am I for gun control or against?  Am I for or against big programs that pay lazy people to sit home?  Feel free to fill me in on what my party stands for cause I only pick one so I can go vote on the person who I believe cares more about making change.  No, that isn't a speech or a personal attack on anyone, just my true naive stance on voting.<br>
<br>
Anyway, back to the Clinton thing.  My statement:  <font color=yellow>You either know enough about both of them to know why I say it or you are too stupid to reason with. Either way it is a waste of time to tell you. </font color>  Wasn't really the best way to state it.  My point is that if you think democrats are better then you obviously aren't based on facts so arguing with you is a waste.  Sure, its a generalization, but its an accurate one 9/10 times.<br>
<br>
As a conservative (NOT read Republican) I see most Liberals (NOT read democrat) as so afraid that their rights will be trampled on that they will let anyone speak for them.  Thats fine and great for them but I choose to look at character.<br>
<br>
As far as backing out of trade agreements or whatever, that is party line BS.  Some president goes in and manages to get stuff through using his party.. next one comes along.. so he has to go by what the other one did?  People do what they want to get done while president and hope it sticks when they leave (some do it for the country and some do it just to be remembered).<br>
<br>
You can take the stance that backing out gives our country the appearance of instability but it doesn't.  When a new boss comes into the company people expect change.  Its just how it is.  Some people will lose jobs, departments will be reorganized, some people will like the new boss, and some people will miss the old boss.  <br>
<br>
Stop saying Bill Clinton lied about sex.  What a cop out.  Makes it all sound so innocent... its just sex right and people in our country lie about sex all the time.  First off we shouldn't be so comfortable with people who lie about sex or anything for that matter.  Second of all we aren't talking about a lie.  We are talking about breaking the law.  You say I don't answer questions so answer these:<br>
<br>
Why did he take the stand knowing he had to lie?<br>
Why did he take the oath knowing he had to lie?<br>
Does the stance "they shouldn't have asked" always excuse perjury or just when its a member of your party?<br>
Can anyone say "thats none of your business so I am going to lie" or does that fall under presidential power?<br>
<br>
Let me over simplify.<br>
<br>
Did Clinton lie on the stand?<br>
Is it against the law to lie on the stand?<br>
What happens to people who lie on the stand?<br>

<br>
So tell me Cendan, since you admit to not being &quot;aware&quot; of issues with Bush outside of &quot;the headlines&quot;, why do you think you know so much that you can flame others as being stupid if they disagree with you? Chances are (by your own addmission) that many are going to know much more about American politics than you if they just read the newspaper in depth. /shrugs <br>
<br>

<br>
Please re-read your words above. You harshly judge Bill Clinton as a political dog because &quot;He always looks...&quot;? Cendan, nobody but a bigot would think they could judge people based upon outer appearances. I suppose you think men who were pink shirts are homosexuals, too? I find it amusing when the ill informed resort to the &quot;he looks like a crook&quot; type of ignorance when judging a person's character. <br>
<br>
Fact is Cendan, you have no real idea what GW Bush is doing. He could be slapping his salami to a Monica Lewinski picture at this very moment and you wouldn't have a clue. Much worse than that he is probably actively fucking over another 3rd world Latin American country just as his father did. Do we know if he is? Yup, just need to read more than the fucking headlines of a newspaper!<br>
<br>
And now for a real favorite of mine...<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> &quot;Why did he take the stand knowing he had to lie?<br>

<br>
Does it really matter to you Cendan if a person lies under oath or lies at all? In other words, you seem to excuse the lies of other Politicians just so long as they don't do it under oath. <br>
<br>
One last thing Cendan, do you even know what President Clinton said under oath verbatim? Since you like to make snap judgements based on news headlines (or whether or not someone has calouses on their lips or wear pink shirts) I doubt you even read the Clinton deposition where it is said that he lied.<br>
<br>
Personally, I prefer to reserve judgement about a person if I don't have the facts at hand. I realize it is easier to haul of and condemn people rather than take time to get the facts. Conservatives seem very trigger happy when it comes character assasination. However, taking time to research an issue prior to judging pays off in the long run. It usually prevents one from looking like a stupid idiot when the facts finally do come out. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Prosecute!</span><hr size=1> Actually thank you. Thank you for elaborating and not having to delve into name calling as you started. I am truly sorry I had to do so. I was afraid that was all you understood and I am quite happy to admit I am wrong and there is honestly no sarcasm there. I truly appreciate well thought out arguments, i think by debating issues we can get down to the heart of matters but to often in this country especially so many people are so passionate about there beliefs they will outright reject a different opinion or facts that rock there dogmatic boat.<br>
<br>
Ok as for your alcohol example, it is perfect. Say you drink to much, should we try to regulate drinking. Isn't that unfair to responsible drinkers. What about porn? What about drugs? What about any of the numerous other vices America at large participates in. I am of the belief that if it is a victimless crime it isn't a crime. Who is harmed by prostitution? Who is harmed by cigarettes? (honestly now is second hand smoke gonna kill me quicker than the smoke stack in the factory across the street or the tap water i can see stuff floating in?)<br>
<br>
I am glad you said Bush didn't represent you, now read the last part of my first post. Yup didn't vote Clinton. As for Abraham Lincoln's secret harlots relating to pride of the nation.. not so much i am sorry to say. If you look at the documents all beliefs America is based upon you will see Thomas Jefferson's name. It has been proven by genetic testing that he fathered children with a slave. A woman he literally owned and could buy and sell. Yet still I think the points he made are very relevant today, despite his immoral ways. <br>
<br>
Clinton wasn't as bad as so and so is my reference to the things that made him a bad president having been done previously by members of the opposite party. I pointed them out to prove that a statement as blunt as Clinton is the worst is a tough sell. Should we accept the stuff he did? I dunno should we treat him worse than those who did it first or worse? And if Clinton was the straw that broke the back shouldn't we have his predecessor owning up to his actions.<br>
<br>
Ok i can see where you think you can trust him. He has reieved great media spin. I don't think the media is conservative or republican in general it is ratings. Bush is aw shucks good ol boy attitude is the same reason the media liked Clinton. Plus i think the media knew they were both bound to fuck things up somehow and make wonderful ratings grabbers. Come on Jimmy Carter couldn't make news he was just a mild mannered grinning fool. Kennedy and Nixon they made the newspeddlers millions. Seriously though I am glad you have an opinion but you and the world would be much better off if people did look deeper into there public figures public actions. Find out if they are doing what we pay them to. This why you elected them. We don't elect them to keep tabs on there private goings on. This is why I try to focus on policy of which i think Clinto did better than the three Republican terms before him. Policy. The reason he was in the office. Was Pete Rose a good baseball player. Yes. To say he was the worst because he was a gambler and liar is an unfair assessment of the job he did. Is Eddie Van Halen a good guitarist?  Yes. To say he was the worst guitarist because he was selfish and destructive to his own band is a crappy assessment of his guitar playing. <br>
George bush seems sincere to you but his squinty smirk creeps me out and his cowboy lingo scares me. Bill clintons easy grin and bulbous red nose reminded me of the guy who thinks it his duty to keep the party hopping at the company picnic. This is not how i form opinions of them though. Personally I wanted to beat him with a discount made GM part after NAFTA. However I am sure lest Pat Buchanon or Ralph Nader, two guys whose blatant honesty scare too many people to capture the mid-ground neccessary to run a campaign, were the prez it would have went through regardless of who sat behind the desk. I mean GW has backed out of our long standing agreements with the world on so many issues now this highly unpopular one would seem like chicken droppings compared to the Kyoto Accords, but still it stands and will. <br>
As for the statement "Am i for or against the big programs that pay lazy people to sit at home?" I think your wording says it all. Lets call it welfare. This figure was published in '97 but is probably still pretty close to accurate.<br>
           All social programs combined from aid to families with dependent children to school lunches to housing assistance amounts to fifty billion dollars. That breaks down to $415 a year per person. <br>
That same year...<br>
Corporations recieved nearly $170 billion in federal tax funded hand outs. That's $1388 a year per person. <br>
So if taking money from the downtrodden just to punish the few lazy shits (and yes there are some, but welfare has such a stigmata to it I knew a woman personally who wouldn't leave her abusive husband because she'd need public assistance to feed her baby) is more of a priority than stopping the bilking of the government by corporations and there multi-millionaire chairmen who hold jobs hostage for a piece of our tax money is a bigger priority, may i suggest reinstating trickle down economics and cutting social services. I am sure the decay of urban America and the rise of crack empires had nothing to do with fattened ceo's taking jobs outta inner cities to move them to areas with better tax breaks and tax payer funded private parking lots. That's another huge rant though and I won't go into that sorry i started I just really cringe when i here a conservative talk about welfare reform. Like i stated earlier more money is wasted in more unproductive areas of government then the one that actually does give something back.<br>
<br>
Ok I am assuming when you say democrats aren't better you aren't implying by default that republicans are better. If that is your stance I agree. I only said democrats were easier to stomach because the average democrat doesn't start an argument by implying your mentally unbalanced and accusing you of performing fellation on whomsoever you were defending.<br>
<br>
I said I thought most dems were to pussy. C'mon guys defend yourselves please. That's why whomsoever is brave enough to say what they believe often does speak for 'em. There are actually lots of intelligent liberals who will never be heard form because they know how the conservative branch of the media will call them out on past imperfections. There is a definite double standard there. Clinton's pot bad, GW's crack not an issue? <br>
<br>
Actually it wasn't a trade agreement bush backed out of it was a anti-ballisitic missile treaty. Signed to help end the cold war. It was designed to slow the massive global build up of armaments. Backing out of has sent ripples through China, Russia, and many other countries. These are agreements which eased hostilities he has said are irrelevent now. they've existed less time than they've been worked on. Arms agreements are less party issues than world issues. Yes America is the world leader but that doesn't mean we are the sole decision makers, like I said Germany thoght that way once too. No backing out doesn't make us look unstable it makes us look like we don't need to abide by the rules the rest of the world has agreed to play by, and on arms that is a major issue.<br>

     Saying Bill Clinton lied about sex makes it sound trivial. Yes. Yes it does. Saying we let some very self righteous minority (and only a minority approved of the trials) throwour country into the greatest turmoil since Nixon's boys broke into Democratic HQ, possibly since the trials of the first failed impeachment attempt so long ago because the president lied about getting oral sex makes it sound more than trivial. It sounds fucking ridiculous. Why? 'cause the republicans couldn't burn him with Whitewatergate, or Travel Gate, or China Gate, or whatever the Gate-of-the-Week was. But Monica Gate they finally had him sure they had to sink to the lowest levels. Sure it had nothing to do with that trollup Jennifer Followers accusations that he improperly touched her after she followed him up to his hotel room. (why is everything  gate you'd think the party that committed that crime wouldn't want it rehashed or are the trying to soften the destruction Nixon did to public trust by showing that crappy investing and philandering men are the true downfall of the country not that elections can be so easily tampered with. Jeez while I am thinking of it which candidate recieved a video tape of the other's practice debating and returned it unopened last election? <br>
<br>
Why did he take the stand knowing blah blah blah?   short answer even presidents can be subpeona'd (SP?)<br>
Why did he take oath knowing ....?  Even presidents can be treated as hostile witnesses. Actually i think he thought whose gonna give a flying ram's shit if i got a bj they couldn't have gone to all the trouble to ... oh wow these guys got a lotta free time. shit! I'm fucked. <br>
I think everyone has the right to lie to questions they feel pressed to answer but don't want to. <br>
Did Clinton lie on the stand? yup<br>
Is it against the law to lie on the stand? short answer yeah. Long answer no. There is precedence (and that is big in legallities) where charges of perjury have been dropped because the person didn't know (s)he was lieing,(oh Bill knew i won't argue that), where the question was misunderstood,( i doubt he misunderstood), and even when the person could prove he wasn't recieving a fair trial.( hmm that one coulda worked but man how much longer would the trial have drug out. thank you Bill for not choosing this route)<br>
What happens to people who lie on the stand? Well precedence says if you are a president nothing. Remember I mentioned Iran/Contra. He is president. The head of everything. Do you think CEOs recieve warnings or have ever been fired for "borrowing" company pencils? Have regular workers? CEOs' jobs are evaluated by the bottom line,<br>
that's how a president should be. Now if he had lied about something that had even the slightest affect on my life or your life than yeah hang him out but I still fail to see how his sexual misdeeds had any affect on peace or prosperity in America or the world. Well I am glad we could take this to a higher ground at least. Thank you again for elaborating and ending the persoanal assaults.<br>

Prosecute!</span><hr size=1> Couple points to add to your fire, since I am reading this and wouldn't mind your opposing views : These are directed to any and all btw<br>
<br>
1)  Do you feel Clinton was justified in lying about the BJ?<br>
<br>
2)  Do you feel that Clinton should have been punished for the actual perjury?  If so, what punishment would have been appropriate and why?<br>
<br>
3)  Do you feel the trial should have waited till he was out of office due to the nature of it?  (Personal)<br>
<br>
4)  Do you feel we (as the people and including our congressmen whom we elect to represent us) should never investigate the personal life of the President while he is in office?<br>
<br>
5)  Do you feel that it is appropriate for a sitting President to lie, even if he may not get caught in it?<br>
<br>
6)  Do you feel it is appropriate for a sitting President to lie only about personal issues?<br>
<br>
7)  As the president is our Chief Executive officer and is our Ambassador to the World, do you feel that a known liar, such as Clinton, was a good choice (in retrospect)?  Please answer based on his own merits, not in comparisons.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Does anyone here feel that the way in which we conduct ourselves in our personal life is usually if not often the way we conduct ourselves in our professional life as well?<br>
<br>
<br>
Now, I'll answer first <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
1) No.<br>
2) Yes, but not until he was out of office.  Whatever the law requires and then let his lawyers work.  (I believe in most states this includes jail time, which I am sure in his case would have been community service).  I believe he should have been punished once out of office because if it had been the average person on the stand, they would have been called upon this and punished by the court of law.<br>
3) Yes.<br>
4) No.  I feel if the circumstances show a need for investigation it should be done, however witchhunts are not necessary.<br>
5) No.<br>
6) No.  A president should not lie while in office.  Period.  <br>
7) As a person, no.  I do not feel he was a person of good moral character, I do not feel he was a good Ambassador to the world.  However, I do agree with many things he did while in office, and I feel he did a good job in the actual running of the country.  I am sure someone could point out many failings and explain why its really someone else's fault or someone else deserves the credit, but /shrug.  From the knowledge I have of the situation, he was a pretty good Chief Exec.  It is embarrassing though to know that when he went to other countries, they knew all about his sex life.  I mean, don't you wonder how often he had to discuss that first in his dealings with other exec's?  &quot;yes, Mr. Chinese Leader, my wife and I are having some marital difficulties, I thank you for your marraige help book, entitled how to keep it in your pants when you've got lots of pressure on you.&quot;  I often wonder how much difficulty that caused.  I am sure though that the other leaders always asked themselves &quot;I wonder if he's lying to me?&quot;  Course they probably had to ask to that before too, since all politicians lie.<br>
<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I do feel that the way in which a person conducts themselves in their personal life, is indeed, reflected in their professional life.  That is why, in my opinion, many people were so upset with Clinton and all the many scandals he had during his presidency.  We are not talking about Kennedy or anyone else, I am sure all Presidents have had scandals or potential scandals.  Most of us have in our lives as well.  We all know inside, I think, that if someone lies about little things at home to their Mom, Dad, Wife, or Dog, that they most likely will lie about at least the little things at work and school, etc.  And maybe the big things too.  After all, if lying is ok, or justifiable, then we can rationalize it away.  The line for where it truly becomes wrong is always below where we are standing.  <br>
<br>
So, now that the truth was out - OMG Clinton LIED! -  and we could no longer pretend to ourselves that our President wasn't actually this great super human being who was perfect.  Damnit!  We were so disappointed to discover he's actually a human, just like you and me!  Wow.  /sarcam off<br>
<br>
Really, I think he should not have lied.  Of course, I think he should not have cheated on his wife.  <br>
<br>
I think we SHOULD have a moral person in office, one of good moral character.  I don't think wanting that, or demanding he be punished for breaking the law is a bad thing, as seems to be the trend.  I think he should have been given the same damn sentence I would have gotten ahd I lied on the stand.<br>
<br>
Yes, I feel people were out to get Clinton, but that doesn't excuse his behavior nor does it justify his lying.  Whether you steal a loaf of bread because you feel like it, or because you are hungry, you are still a thief.  One might be justified, but you'd probably still get some type of punishment because the law had been broken.  In Clinton's case, the lying was not justified.  His behavior, even though in his personal life, was inexcusable.  Face it folks, he screwed up.  He did.  Admit it.  He broke the law.  Why he was hunted down, why his trial happened, why he was almost forced out of office, it all becomes moot when you consider that he was guilty.  Do I feel the punishment exceeded the crime (or the almsot punishment of impeachment)?  Yes.  Lying is wrong, but in his case, was not impeachable in my opinion. <br>
<br>
Only one quote I want to include here:<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  As long as Bible-thumping moralist shitheads such as yourself continue to approve Congressional witchhunts targetted at our chief of state, the chief of state will continue to do what is necessary to secure the office they are given.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I know lots of people who believe Clinton was morally wrong, and they are not Church goers or bible thumpers as stated here.  Whether they approved the so called witch hunt or not, I dont know, but lets not generalize too much here.  <br>
<br>
Also, having a Chief of State who does whatever is necessary in order to keep his office is NOT a good trend IF you are stating the following.  If you mean - the president should use any means necessary in order to avoid scrunity and accountability in his life while he is in power - I do not agree with you at all.  <br>
<br>
Lets use an analogy.  Would you want someone teaching your child who was an admitted child molester?  How about a child abuser?  How about a teacher who has contributed to the deliquency of a minor?  How about a teacher who has lied for example, on the stand, about a personal issue in their sex life, perhaps whether they had sex with an 18 year old student right after graduation?  I hope your answer would be no, you really wouldn't want this kind of person teaching your child if you had a choice.  Why?  They have had an admitted moral charachter flaw and you wouldn't want them teaching your kid in case your child learned something you didn't want them too - you don't want that variable in their life.<br>
<br>
How about this?  Would you want a CEO in your company who was a known embezzler?  One who was accused of embezzling?  one who lied ont eh stand during an embezzling case?  Might you not be a bit concerned about that and how it might affect the company,  and hence your job at the very least?<br>
<br>
How much more then, does the President represent.  How much more does his character, personally, and that of the office in general, affect his leadership of our country?<br>
<br>
It does affect it.  how much I am not sure.<br>
<br>
Now, please answer the above questions.  Not sure who's quote that was, I copied it and hit a general reply.  Notice that I am not defending anyone here, not flaming anyone, and not really supporting anyone.  Just gave my own opinion on the matter.  Now, I'd love to read yours clearly stated and please include reasons why you chose what you did.  <br>

Prosecute!</span><hr size=1> 1) Yes, he was justified. Just as much as you are justified in claiming you don't masturbate when directly questioned.<br>
<br>
2) No. Should we punish you if you claim your dog didn't lick out your pussy when you let it and were too embarassed to admit you put the peanut butter down there for it to lick?<br>
<br>
3) Yes. Peanut butter licking episodes or the like are private affairs and I could care fucking less what Bill did privately.<br>
<br>
4) Yes. The President should be allowed to slap his salami at will in the Oval office on the Queen of England if he and her likes and we the public should never care to know about it.<br>
<br>
5) All Presidents lie Lukaria. Where have you been? Have you ever lied Lukaria? Why do you expect more from your president?<br>
<br>
6) Yes. Don't you lie about your weight Lukaria? You are a female aren't you?<br>
<br>
7) Yes, in retrospect Clinton was a good choice. Under his terms we saw more economic gains than what was delivered under any other President since Truman in US history.<br>
<br>
8) Oops there is no eight! hehehe<br>
<br>
Lukaria let me ask you some questions.<br>
<br>
1) How much do you weigh?<br>
<br>
2) What is your height?<br>
<br>
3) What race are you?<br>
<br>
4) When was the last time you had sex?<br>
<br>
5) Do you ever rub your pussy too hard?<br>
<br>
6) Are you a lesbian or have you ever been with a lesbian or have you ever licked out a vagina?<br>
<br>
7) Do you find the above questions to abusive and personal?<br>
<br>
8) Why would you allow your congressmen to ask such questions of your President and or other members of the government?<br>
<br>
Is my point well taken? I hope so.<br>
