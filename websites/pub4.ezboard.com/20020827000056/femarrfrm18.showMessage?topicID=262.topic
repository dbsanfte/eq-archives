<br>
<font color=yellow>1.  Racial Profiling.</font color><br>
<br>
   I guess to some degree I don't understand the problem here.  I obviously don't support pulling people over or stopping them based on color.  That is a problem.<br>
<br>
   I have to ask, however, if you are pulled over based on color/race after something like September 11th... is it really that big of a deal.  To what extent do we encourage people not to do this.  Do we let people pass, despite suspicion of wrong doing, because we are afraid of being accused of profiling.<br>
<br>
   I don't know, part of me says that if a cop pulls over someone of middle eastern origin for a LEGITIMATE reason... and decides to run the guys ID where he normally wouldn't... I think that is justified.  I am NOT talking about seeing someone who looks foreign and pulling them over just to check their ID, nor am I talking about treating them like a criminal.  I am JUST talking about a cop who says to himself "I am gonna run this just in case."<br>
<br>
   I know, part of me says this is unfair to the individual... but then part of me is reminded that to error (if it is an error) on the side of caution is better than to have more incidents like this one.<br>
<br>
<font color=yellow>2.  Hate Crimes.</font color><br>
<br>
   I don't understand what a Hate Crime is.  I mean, I know how the government looks at it... but it makes no sense to me.<br>
<br>
   I assume that most violent crimes are enacted with a certain ammount of hatred, whether long term or short term.  As far as I am concerned you are violating a persons Constitutional rights by handing out different sentences for different people based on percieved situations.<br>
<br>
   Oh, you hated the ethnic origin of the person.. oh, well then lets double the sentence.  You called him a "nigger" while you were choking him, oh, then you get twice as tough a sentence as the man who killed a 8 year old girl.<br>
<br>
   Killing is killing, assault is assault.  If you want to toughen sentences accross the board, so be it... but I don't like this situational justice.  I think its important to point out that murder can fairly be distinguished from man slaughter in some cases and I am not talking about that.<br>
<br>
   To me it seems that hate crime legislation as well as affirmitive action are forcing people to focus on the very thing they claim to try and stamp out.<br>
<br>
   Under affirmative action an employer was forced to look at the color of the skin, to give a minority man/woman a job they MIGHT not have otherwise earned, just to meet a quota.<br>
<br>
   What purpose does hate crime legislation serve?  Does this mean that minorities, whether ethnic or otherwise, deserve swifter or more severe vengance?<br>
<br>
   I am curious, if you kill a man and he turns out to be gay... are you guilty of a hate crime.  Not in my eyes, but then... the court decides.<br>
<br>
   People might say, "It's not fair for them to be singled out for persecution."  Explain that to the parents of a straight child whose son was murdered, and the murderer got half the sentence that a convicted "hate crime murderer" got.  Do you think that the sexual preference of their child matters to them at this point?  Substitute race if you want, same question.<br>
<br>
   <br>
<br>
<font color=red><b>Note:<br>
  I don't have a solid opinion on either of these issues, despite what it may seem.  These are just questions in my mind.  Feel free to express your opinion.  I am sure some people will feel the need to "educate" me.</b></font color> <p><font color=green><b>Cendan Tankenpriest</b></font color><br>

<br>
Concerning profiling:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> &quot;I don't know, part of me says that if a cop pulls over someone of middle eastern origin for a LEGITIMATE reason... and decides to run the guys ID where he normally wouldn't... I think that is justified.&quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
The problem is over just what counts as a &quot;legitimate&quot; reason. Pulling someone over because of their ethnicity is not legitimate. One reason is that discrimination is apparent in profiling. Usually profiling is only accomplished with people of color. If 9/11 had been comitted by a German terrorist group, then we would not be able to &quot;profile&quot; in most cases because of skin color. That to me demonstrates a glaring problem with profiling. It is usually just a rationalization for outright discrimination on the basis of race and religion. For instance, how does one tell if a person is of Middle Eastern origin? There are &quot;white&quot; people born in the Middle East who are Christians. Do we pull over people who are brown and carry the Koran, for instance? Again, what would count as &quot;legitimate&quot;?<br>
<br>
Conerning hate crimes:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> &quot;To me it seems that hate crime legislation as well as affirmitive action are forcing people to focus on the very thing they claim to try and stamp out.&quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
The FBI defines hate crimes as &quot;a criminal offense committed against a person, property or society which is motivated, in whole or in part, by the offender's bias against a race, religion, disability, sexual orientatio, or ethnicity/national origin.&quot; &lt;<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.fbi.gov/ucr/Cius_98/98crime/98cius16.pdf>">www.fbi.gov/ucr/Cius_98/9...ius16.pdf></a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
It is the nature of such a crime that distinguishes it from all other types of crimes. Hence, punishment suitable to the nature of the crime must be enforced upon offenders. It is not difficult to discern from the above definition why hate crimes are unique and should be treated seperately under the law. The sort of malice involved in a hate crime is worthy the contempt of a humane society and offenders should be treated with extreme prejudice, I think.<br>
<br>
The difficulty may be in ascertaining whether or not a hate crime has been commited. A black man butchered in his home with a burning cross in the front yard is clearly a hate crime. A gay man gunned down in the street with no clear indication that he was shot because he was gay is going to be a tough case. However, in those cases where a hate crime is clearly commited punishment should fit the nature of the malice.<br>
<br>
I know I didn't address all your comments. I just wanted to share my two coppers worth. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>Lurikeen Mali'Kyre<BR>

<br>
1. Racial Profiling - Whether the cop wants to admit it or not, running a middle easterner's identity &quot;just in case&quot; is a form of (negative) discrimination.  There's no two ways about this.  I'm not saying that discrimination as an act of classifying people according to physical attributes is wrong, per se, but becomes wrong when you make connections between these attributes and an increased likelihood in criminal activity.  One might argue that certain ethnicities are more likely to have committed a crime simply through statistics, but this is not evidence of wrong-doing and should not be considered to even possibly to connect with a suspect.  <br>
<br>
Sure, perhaps the person pulled over committed a crime.  Depending on the type of crime an officer can or cannot legally search the individual, his/her car or his/her residence/office/whatever.  The legal precidents are in place in order to protect his/her rights, as well as everyone else's rights as free citizens.<br>
<br>
Lastly, and this is something I just LOVE bringing up, if we started running checks on Middle Easterners because of their possible (however unsubstantiated) ties to terrorist activities, why wouldn't these checks be performed on caucasians? There was an American Taliban you know. Further, why weren't white people given such scrutiny after Timothy McVeigh's attack on the Federal Building in Kansas City? <br>
<br>
Just an interesting figure as well: About 1 in 20 foreign students studying in the US has been arrested, detained or questioned in regards to terrorism.  <br>
<br>
Sorry Cen, profiling is clear-cut discrimination in my mind.<br>
<br>
2. Hate Crimes<br>
<br>
The use of the term Hate Crime is only applied if it's found that the violent act committed was due to a conscious and premeditated hatred toward the individual based on ethnicity, sexual preference, or whatever other attribute where discrimination threatens a minority of individuals that the courts decide warrant protection. <br>
<br>
There's a reason for this. These demographics are the minority.  The intent is to attempt to protect minorities, to give them the same liberties that the 'majority' holds.  The majority may be the Catholics, the Whites, the Heterosexuals, or just the opposite (in my mind) if someone attacks, kills or threatens a person who is in the minority in a situation where the majority could pose a serious hamper on his/her liberty.  <br>
<br>
In the end, to me (as well as you, I gather) for a crime to be a Hate Crime, hatred due to prejudice against the person must be proven.  This goes without qualifying what prejudice is, and yes, the courts decide the standards by which this is all determined, but I cannot say that removing system in place for &quot;Hate Crimes&quot; will help anything.  I think it would hurt the situations, honestly, but can you honestly tell me this is wrong:<br>
<br>
A man walks into a bar.  He's with friends, also male, who know that he is homosexual.  The bar is predominantly heterosexual.  This man obviously knows this, and assuming he's in his right mind, he feels no need to broadcast that he's gay.  One of his friends, after a few drinks, jokes with him, asking if he finds such and such a guy &quot;cute&quot;.  Someone, let's say a guy named Bert, near them overhears, and with a few drinks in him, and while the gay man tries to difuse his joking friend, Bert flips out, beats the man senseless.  At sentencing it's found this is a hate crime.  The judge imposes a longer sentence than for a normal bar-room altercation, let's say, in accordance with hate crime laws in the state of x.  Bert is being punished not only for the beating, but for harboring views that are intolerable to society (as seen by the courts) because they infringe on the gay man's liberty.  <br>
<br>
I'm rather sure this is how Hate Crime law is supposed to work, and I think that's great.  You can't just go beat someone because they're gay.  You want to argue the finer points of the statutes.  I'd rather let the statutes stand up against a court system that has the ability to change itself through precident and appeal.  <br>

No matter why someone does it.  Not liking someone because of sexual preference, race, ethnicity, etc., is NOT a crime.  At least not in the USA.  It is generally considered wrong, but under the laws of the USA a person is entitled to THINK whatever they want.  No matter how wrong someone else thinks it is.  Punishing someone extra because the motive for a crime is unpopular is just as wrong in my opinion.  People should be punished for comitting crimes, more often then not, this punnishment should be harsh in my opinion.  But to make it harsher because the crime was comitted out of bias of some kind, rather than the usual greed, pasison, power lust, etc. is just crazy.<br>

<blockquote type=cite><blockquote><hr>"Do we pull over people who are brown and carry the Koran, for instance? Again, what would count as "legitimate"?"<hr></blockquote></blockquote><br>
<br>
I tried to make it clear that I meant a legitimate pull over.  Of course we could argue what is legitimate, but let's assume in this instance that procedure was followed.  Now, even in the case of a legitimate pullover an officer would watch for anything suspicious.  Finding something would obviously lead that officer to search or further identify the driver.<br>
<br>
I know my question isn't a good one since it calls for too many undefined terms (i.e. Legitimate cause, reasonable suspicion, etc), so once again I am just kind of mulling it over.  I am very aware that this is coming from a lower-middle class white guy who lives in the suburbs... so this may have some impact on my opinion, despite the fact that I am very against racism and prejudism.<br>
<br>
Anyway, if this person is pulled over and the cop decides to run the ID based on ____________ <insert bias> is this unfair.  Answer that based on normal every day life, and then stop and answer it based on events following September 11th.<br>
<br>
<br>
<blockquote type=cite><blockquote><hr>The FBI defines hate crimes as "a criminal offense committed against a person, property or society which is motivated, in whole or in part, by the offender's bias against a race, religion, disability, sexual orientatio, or ethnicity/national origin."<hr></blockquote></blockquote><br>
<br>
Okay, a definition makes the government stance more clear, but doesn't answer my question.  I am not saying you didn't, I am saying that their defenition doesn't really give a good answer.<br>
<br>
Like I stated before, they are holding predjudice against the criminal.  Because he hates ________ <insert race, religion, sex, or other> he gets a stricter sentence?  What happened to him being allowed to think/feel for himself?<br>
<br>
I don't like people who hate people... but does that mean that they don't have a right to hate?  They have a right to hate blacks or christians or gays.  Its opinion, even if bad.<br>
<br>
It doesn't matter if that is why they kill.  Killing is killing.  Let the punishment fit the crime.<br>

I am not playing "devils advocate" but at the same time I am asking things from one stance that is contrary to, in part or in whole, what I feel (not believe) to be right.<br>

<br>
I can’t help but question it giving them the “same” liberties that it gives me.  It seems as if it is giving them extra liberties.  If I am killed my killer gets one term, where their killer would get much more.  What makes their life more valuable? The fact that they believe something or that they were born somewhere different than me?  Isn’t that giving a bit of preference?<br>
<br>
If a man kills his wife because she was cheating and she believed that adultery was okay, then he has killed someone in the minority right?  I don’t mean to sound stupid, and forgive me if I do, I am just trying to make sense of this.  <br>
<br>
I don’t think that the reason for killing someone should have anything to do with the punishment.  If we start determining that then do we also give leniency to people who act for a “noble” cause?  Or am I just missing something?<br>
<br>
I guess that either way you go the question becomes where do you draw the line, and if the line is a grey matter and not black/white then how can we guarentee the rights of a criminal.  Criminals do have rights... and those rights can't be given or taken on a whim.  They have to be equal for all right?<br>
<br>
If someone is gay, it isn't a statement.. it isn't a right.  Living is a right.  Living how you want is a right.  Gay, straight, etc.  <br>
<br>
Killing someone isn't a statement, it is a crime.  Some people live in such a way that they try to make a statement, but in the end... its either life or death right?<br>
<br>
You take a life, or you don't.<br>
<br>
Sorry if this seems repetitive or longwinded.<br>

Ah, right, got it. &quot;Legitimate&quot; here being something like pulling a car over with a tail light out. But, since that is the case then what could &quot;profiling&quot; mean? If I am stopping someone for a legitimate reason, then I am not really profiling them, right? I am going to run a check against their license plates and driver's license as a matter of procedure (most cops do). Now, of course, if I pull over a car for a broken tail light to find that the passenger is browned skin and wearing a Turban and decide to search the vehicle based upon those attributes of the driver, then I am profiling. However, that seems to be wrong to me. I would just be justifying racial prejudice or religious prejudice under the guise of profiling. Hmm... a perplexing issue you have raised. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
I see your point. I think you are saying that hate is wrong, period and that punishing hate crime offenders (on the basis of criminal definitions of &quot;hate crime&quot;) only engenders more hate. Society is thereby &quot;hating&quot; the hate crime criminal and infliciting an unjust sentence upon them which is equally wrong. Something like that?<br>
<br>
If so the difficulty is one of equivocating on &quot;hate&quot;. Speaking for myself, I hate murder (I think many feel the same way). There are varying degrees of murder based upon the nature of the crime. The punishment met out to a murderer is not based upon one's hate for murder, but what is considered just (by society) punishment for the act. Accidentally capping a family member is not as culpable an act as premeditating the death of someone then executing the action that kills. Point being, that the punishments involved have nothing to do with the individual responsible, but the percieved severity of the act itself.<br>
<br>
Here we may find that a hate crime is even more blameworthy because not only did the individual probably premeditate the murder but did so on the basis of the victim's race, religion, sexual orientation, etc. Society has found that justice can only be served by punishing such crimes with extreme prejudice. As a society we want to differentiate between varying degrees of malice involved in the crime. &quot;Hate Crimes&quot; involve the greatest degree of malice. The desire to cause pain to another in such cases go far beyond simple hatred of the person, but a deep hatred of the person's spirit: their very identity. At any rate, I am starting to get preachy. Better stop here. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Self-defense justifies killing.  Insanity may not justify killing, but does not lead to an equivilant punishment that a premeditated and sane murderer might be subject to.  <br>
<br>
I'm interested to hear your view of War Crimes opposed to Hate Crimes.  I see very little difference in some ways.  You punish the criminal more harshly to provide an example for those who share the same unauthorized beliefs.  Whether this is right or wrong is up to neither of us, it's up to the government, and to them, yep, it it's legit.  &lt;shrug&gt; You raise an interesting point. Having read Foucault I could also understand believing in the ineptitude for punishment for &quot;example&quot;.<br>

<br>
They are HIGHLY trained to look for little things as reasonable cause to make a car pull over.  <br>
<br>
Almost every older car in America violates several (like 30 or something) minor rules in some way.  Even some new cars may not be completely compliant with transportation laws in your state.  The RCW is a fat book, with many miniscule details that you ordinarily never get stopped for.  The tail-light/headlight out is like sending a policeman a beacon saying &quot;PULL HIM OVER&quot;.<br>
<br>
But the cop's gut tells him something is wrong w/ the '79 panel van driving down the road, yet it isn't speeding and all his lights are working.  Follows for a bit, and whamo, the lights come on and he'll have a &quot;LEGIT&quot; reason he pulled you over so he could run your license and registration through his ubercop computer.  (btw Wonder if it would run EQ...&lt;VBG&gt;)  Sure enough, intuition was right and there are outstanding warrants and the bad guy gets locked up.  OR, no wants and everything is clean, after a minute or two of conversation to look for something &quot;hinky&quot;, the officer tells the guy driving the van that his hubcaps (or whatever) are missing and give him an oral (or written) warning and off he goes.<br>
<br>
If the guy gives him grief, the warning may turn into a ticket.  Police are all to human too.<br>
<br>
Even if your brand new car is perfect, if you touch a road line driving straight or make a turn a bit too wide or sharp, it is grounds for pulling you over.  California stops will usually get you ticketed.  I got nailed for one of those, and I'm a NY bred-driver. /boggle<br>
<br>
Take care,<br>
Frekkels<br>
<br>
PS:  &quot;Black and white fever&quot; is a known psychological nervous effect of being followed for a distance by a police car.  A normally sensible driver does something wrong by being EXTRA careful not to and ends up getting pulled over.  The cops know it too. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/bemarr.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=rittdabard>rittdabard</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 40<br> <font color=#E9D756>(1/9/02 7:04:54 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=262.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Legit pull-overs</span><hr size=1>  Always look at any law as how it can be abused (because eventually, it probably will be) versus how can it benefit. We already know in some cities and in some departments racism occurs. Every other year some cop yells nigger while beating the shit out of a black student.  I honestly don't believe that profiling would stop more than a couple of crimes. Is a couple of crimes worth making the minorities distrusting and scared of the people who are supposed to serve and protect us all.<br>

  Hate crimes is bull in my opinion. I do believe it is necessary for now but I would like to see it become a blue law. Murder is murder. If you kill someone and it isn't manslaughter its murder. All hate crimes are already crimes. I think however some parts of America, (including my own community) 8( are so backwards that a fire in the belly freak like Pastor Fred Phelps could incite enough public support to help a murderer of a gay, like Matthew Shephard, get an unfairly easy trial. I don't know for sure. Very touchy subjects, and an excellant debate to help keep us aware. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showPrevMessage?topicID=262.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showNextMessage?topicID=262.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=262.topic&index=8><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/gfx/addReply1.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.emailToFriend?topicID=262.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.threadControl?topicID=262.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/deleteThreadFire.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=262.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=262.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub4.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="emarrmessageboardrules">Message Board Rules<option value="emarrlinks">Links<option value="emarrupcomingmmorpgs">Upcoming MMOG's<option value="emarrfrm18">America Under Attack<option value="emarrfrm19">Dark Age of Camelot<option value="emarrgeneral">General<option value="emarrfrm17">Funny Stuff<option value="emarrbazaar">Item Bazaar<option value="emarrscrollsnspells">Spell Bazaar<option value="emarrfrm15">Shiny Things<option value="emarrfrm14">Bargain Basement<option value="emarrfrm20">Crafter's Hideout<option value="emarrdragonsandplanes">Rants and Flames<option value="emarrfrm13">Dragons and Planes<option value="emarrroleplaying">Roleplaying<option value="emarrroleplayingoocforum">Roleplaying - OOC Forum<option value="emarrscammeralert">Scammer Alert<option value="emarrsignaturecorner">Test Forum<option value="emarrreallife">Real Life<option value="emarrothermmorpgs">Other MMOG's</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#E9D756>- </font><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/bemarr>Erollisi Marr, The Queen of Love</a><font color=#E9D756> - </font><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18>America Under Attack</a> <font color=#E9D756> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM GAMES AD SCRIPT -->
