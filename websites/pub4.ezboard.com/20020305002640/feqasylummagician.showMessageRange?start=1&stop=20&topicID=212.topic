 seems like every bitch post that a uber guild magician does, all they cry bout is that all they do is summon mod rods.  well geez guys, i know for a fact that a dmg shield is irresistable damage to a mob, and especially if a mob is not slowed, that that damage can add up to a TON of damage over time.  if uber guilds are not allowing their magicians to cast damage shields on the main tanks... then uber guilds are not as bright as i thought they were....<br><br>on some mobs, magicians even get to summon a pet and let the pet attack the mob.  so with mod rods, damage shield, and pet.... that is three things a magician does during an uber mob, high end encounter.<br><br>i am sorry if you uber mages are in guilds that only ask you to do one thing.  maybe you should join another guild that will let you do three things during an uber encounter battle.<br><br>this post is not directed at gamrok, or any guild in particular.  it is the cumulination of many many whine/bitch posts made by lvl 60 magicians in uber guilds who continue to moan and complain about the high end game.<br><br>get over it guys.  we have a job to do, do it right.  don't do it right, and there is a chance your raid fails.  if you don't like your role, then stop playing your magician and do another class.  most raids need at least one magician to perform the role... i have no problems being the only lvl 60 magician on the lanys server if it means that all i do during a vulak battle is summon mod rods.....<br><br>for someone like myself, who has never seen vulak, i have no problems summoning mod rods for a vulak battle just to be able to say that i saw the mob.<br><br> <p>Cicely Goldenfair <BR>Lanys Cheerleader <BR>Lvl 60 Arch Mage <BR><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=10393">Magelo Profile</a> </p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ukailtor.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kailtor</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://kailtor.8m.com/deflated.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Cyber Pimp</span><br> <font color=#000033>(1/9/02 10:38:03 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylummagician.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=212.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://kailtor.8m.com/kaildreds.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Verant's Vision of the High Level Mage..</span><hr size=1> make a monk!<br>them are fun!<br><br>and sure we can DS (1 point more than a druid) and sure we can mod rod (yawn) and sure we can nuke (everyone nukes better) and sure we can make pets (who die to ripostes or AE) and sure we can mala (shamen get malo) and sure we can CoH (too bad it got nerfed) and sure we can summon items (that are not worth a level 60 character)<br><br>so.  we can nuke, but why nuke when you can make mod rods for better nukers?  we can stack malosini on malo (this is actually a useful thing a mage can do, imagine that), we can coh (yay?), we can make a pet (who does minimal damage to a mob 20 levels above it not to mention getting eaten by AEs where applicable).<br><br>I made a mage for one reason.  Back before Kunark, a mage was PURE DAMAGE.  That's the only reason I made him.  I was powerful back then.  It was fun to outdamage people with my uber 600 DD nukes and level 44 pets that could kill warriors.  But now?  I'm one of the lowest damage output characters on a raid.  How many classes are there?  I forget.  But who can out damage a mage on say a 70 mob?  Rogue, Monk, Warrior(with uber weapons i guess), Wizard, Necro (dots), Druid (if they nuke), ranger (ts, probably without too), SK (not sure about this, but Ralanan is a mean KSer.  :P)<br><br>What does that leave?  Paladin which I assume is probably equal.  Bard which is not a damage class at all.  Cleric Shaman Enchanter, all buff/heal/debuff classes.  And Beastlords which will probably end up outdamaging us too come level 60.  So mages are right above the buff classes and about equal with Paladins (in my opinion, it depends on the mob of course)  I made my class to do DAMAGE, not to become a support class 5 expansions later.<br><br>That's why I'm a monk.  Not only do I do damage, but I get to pull and see more of the zone than just a damn camp spot.  :P <p><center><hr width=25%>  <table width="25%" border="1" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="1">    <tr>       <td width="50%">         <div align="center"><font face="veranda"><b><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=50592">Kailtor           LunarFlare</a></b></font></div>      </td>      <td width="50%">         <div align="center"><font face="veranda"><b><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=64912">Kailtrex</a></b></font></div>      </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td width="50%">         <div align="center"><font face="veranda">60 <font color="red">Battlemage</font></font></div>      </td>      <td width="50%">         <div align="center"><font face="veranda">55<font color="red"> Master</font></font></div>      </td>    </tr>  </table><font face="veranda"><font size=-2><a href="http://www.eqvisions.com/">Visions</a><br>  <a href="http://www.lanys.com">Lanys T'vyl</a><br>  </font></font><hr width=25%></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ugamrok.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gamrok</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>p0\/\/3r-p0sT3r!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(1/9/02 2:14:53 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylummagician.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=212.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Verant's Vision of the High Level Mage..</span><hr size=1> I cast Damage Shields, I summon arrows, food and water for people, I CoH the puller every once in a while (in Velious at least), and I cast mod rod 2.<br><br>That is my role, I'm not saying that mages are the only class with one role.  I'm simply saying that our role continues to changes because of bad design on Verant's part.. let's look at this..<br><br>Pre-kunark:  Quite simply we were overpowered, we were probably *the* most damaging class in the game.<br><br>Kunark:  With the epic pet, our damage was decent at best, but our pet was disallowed at many raids due to pathing bugs.. Our CoH and Mod Rod role begins to form.<br><br>Velious:  Pet?  What pet?  With mobs that riposte for insane damage (high end) and AE, our pet won't last long at all and certainly isn't close to the kind of damage melee are dishing out vs. 'uber' mobs.  Our role is the CoH/Mod Rod person.<br><br>Velious, post melee upgrade:  I'm not complaining about the much needed upgrade, but our best pet is now being outdamaged by paladins (Note:  Not all paladins can outdamage the epic pet, but since I kill the same mobs as the paladins I hang out with most of the time, my power should increase as much as their's, right?).  Our role however, is still the same.<br><br>Shit out of Luck:  CoH is disabled in most zones because of keyed areas (i.e. bad design).  Mod Rod 2 is released, which makes nuking just down right stupid.  New Role on high end Luclin raids?  Mod Rod dispensers.<br><br>Errr, just add Damage shielder and mostly useless summon item summoner to the roles of all eras.  <br><br>Now, our main role on a raid is to summon mod rods.. Cicely, I think the reason that myself and Kailtor, as well as many other mages, dislike our class role is because it is BORING and being in a raid guild we do it EVERY day.  In Visions we still have positive attitude mages, not all of us are disappointed in our class.  Me?  I'm bored on raids and unless I'm part of an amazing kill or pulling (When we killed Vyemm for the first time I felt amazing, for example) I don't get much thrill anymore.  <br><br>Recently we almost wiped out after a routine 'uber' mob kill, after the fight people were saying how close we were to missing out on our 'uber' loots.. I had no idea how close we were, because I was summoning mod rods and dispelling the AE off one person.<br><br>Soo, our role isn't useless, I'll give you that.. Mod rod 2 is one of the most amazing spells ever to be released, but it is NOT fun to use.  However,  if you look at other classes that are similar to us, or the one class that is (necros), with Luclin their role has only been expanded with the release of the group debuff things.<br><br>Now, I'm sure you're wondering why I haven't levelled up a twink yet.. And to be honest, it's because I can't stand to grind, and never could.  I still have some faith in Verant for some reason, and I still have a ton of fun on my mage when doing exp groups in challenging areas.  Of course, getting in those groups is pretty tough.. But that's a whole other rant =p<br><br>P.S.

Verant have kept changing what the 'vision' is for Mages, unlike for any other class, and this is what causes the upset, as characters created with one thing in mind find they are not what they were meant to be, or thought they were going to be, or wanted to be. I created a mage as a fun damage dealing caster, not as a support class (I've got one of those already, thanks, *grin*).<br><br>But I am afraid, I am one of those folks who thinks threads like this are also *part* of the problem. They encourage those who known little about the Magician class to put us in that little box of what we are good and not good at, and this is not a place that is good for us. I'm a tiny guild player BY CHOICE, who wants the 'raid' to be the big event from time to time, and to mostly play in groups and have fun, not feel I am going to work to do a job. Getting groups is made harder by a mage-inspired viewpoint that we are poor, and in groups, we are not poor, we are still strong (though not like pre-kunark, I know). For example, even with her rather modest gear, Suzanna can make far more of a contribution to almost any 6-person xp group than, say, an average wizard of the same level who also is without epic. But there are so many ignorant players who think mages are poor (and realise they are not when they group with one who knows the job). It's all about where you are and how you think.<br><br>There is more, much more to EQ than JUST ubermob raids. I know some guilds do nothing else, but I will get to the heart of it - that *is* the problem - I've never been able to understand why anyone would want to raid everyday, but that's me I guess. Almost every friend I have who plays in a guild like that admits they find it boring and don't have fun. /boggle Gamrok, if that kind of play is boring to you, do something else! I mean that kindly, sir, not in any other way, but isn't having fun why you first played this game?<br><br>So, mages are not too great on ubermob raids, in terms of fun. I don't do many, and I'm not in your league of accomplishents (/bow, but frankly I have no ambition to be, as long as I have fun). I still have fun on dragon raids and in HoT, and play as a damage dealer, and so what if I can't match the wizards there for damage, I still play my part and have a good time. But ... it wouldn't be fun if I went there (or anywhere) every day.<br><br>I love the Magician class, despite all the annoyances regarding what exactly IS our role above 55. But I won't be boxed into the MR2 / COH / DS only trap (actually, I don't have MR2 yet lol, but whatever ;p ).<br><br>Do what you enjoy. If you don't enjoy it, do something else.

These posts get people thinking, which gets others thinking, which eventually might get enough people thinking that maybe there really is a need for a change in the Mage class.<br><br>First off, enchanters are actually quite useful in Luclin raids (at least, most of them) and the new group buff spells that necros have at least make it so they need to be at the keyboard while raiding.  While on the other hand, Verant has not only ignored mage concerns, but they have actually decreased our usefullness on raids.  I'm talking of course about the fact that only two high level raiding zones in SoL (that I can think of..

There's a few reasons, <br><br>1) As a mage, it's hard to get groups together with complete strangers and then lead them deep into a dungeon where it's actually challenging.<br><br>2) The complete stranger thing.. I have about 10 or so friends that are not in Visions, and some of them are not in my level range.<br><br>3) If anyone knows Ralanan, you know that being in an exp group with him is just plain, insane, *that* is the kind of exp group that keeps me entertained.. I don't know anyone that can pull as safely chaotic as him, nor do I have any out of guild enchanter friends that I know can handle that kind of pulling.<br><br>4) Any group that doesn't fit the characteristics of #3 is even mroe boring than a raid.<br><br>5) Although raiding may not be fun, Mod Rod 2 is still a great tool to keep the pulls going, so as long as it isn't a certain temple for the 500th time, I can usually keep myself entertained through /tell's and the fact that we're actually going through these mobs like they're butter.<br><br>6) I'm sure there's more, but I think you get my point..<br><br>Llorian, I totally agree with your last point.. This weekend I'm (hopefully) attempting a little something involving two groups in Velk's, and one day hope to do a mage/cleric only PoH raid.  Those are similar to challenging exp groups in that they keep me on my toes rather than summoning mod rods while watching 20+ melee beat on a mob.<br> <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ugamrok.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gamrok</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0> at: 1/11/02 9:48:34 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ueuripedmoped.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Euriped Moped</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Board Whore</span><br> <font color=#000033>(1/11/02 12:32:51 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylummagician.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=212.topic&index=9>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> <BR><img src=http://home.attbi.com/~yolora/zdance.gif height=40 width=40></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Verant's Vision of the High Level Mage..</span><hr size=1> A class should do the same thing at level 60, that they do at level 1.<br><br><!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> This is horrid to say, but I think Verant's vision of the high level mage... is a sugar daddy for a melee alt.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>Working on my third melee alternate now.

So, melee increase their damage, hit points, resists and even mana for hybrids substantially while we settle for just stat increases with nothing good to use that extra mana on other than summoning mod rods.  <br><br>Although mod rods do help a lot, I'll admit that, they are not fun, and even Clerics who "just heal" can buff, Shamans who "just slow" buff as well, rangers buff, heal, melee and do bow damage.  All I'm asking for is the 'slow' or 'heal' of the mage class to accompany our mod rod dispenser status.  Also, I know that we have damage shields, but I was thinking more along the lines of something that is used as often as heals and slows (God I'm gonna get a lot of arguments for that!).<br><br>(I know I'm jumping all over the place and not making much sense, but I'm in a rush =p )<br><br>No matter how good the pathing was, I would very rarely summon a pet on a high end raid vs. a single mob or for the clearing.  Although the pet would help against mobs, the melee damage of the epic pet when not tanking is approximately 40dps I think, which is absolutely terrible.  The risk of it breaking even one mez, or aggroing one mob is not worth the risk of that added damage, in my opinion.  <br><br>Now, I know that multiple pets isn't exactly something that falls into what I'm talking about, but this would be our parallel skill to Dire Charm, something that would allow us to solo/group much better with the added damage.  Summon primal also benefits only ourselves, but with that and maybe some sort of spell that gives added damage, immunities, AC and hit points to our pets then perhaps they just might be worth summoning on a high level raid.<br><br>Some other spells that might help, Buffs that deal with the elements, but not actual illusions... For example; Fire buffy thing could increase attack with a small DS, water buff could increase mana and hit point regeneration, earth could increase hit points and resists, air could give see invis and maybe haste or AC.<br><br>I'm not really sure what the point of this post was, and I'm sorry if it's hard to understand with all the grammar mistakes and topic jumping..<br><br>Edit:  Just read an idea over on the Mage Compendium.. Having weapons with bane damage and procs would be great, and would fit into the masters of summoning role. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ugamrok.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gamrok</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0> at: 1/16/02 1:29:53 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/usandrastorm.showPublicProfile?language=EN>SandraStorm</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t d00d!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(1/16/02 5:12:48 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylummagician.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=212.topic&index=20>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: da mage</span><hr size=1> What I ment by stupid summoning spells was useless summoning spells.
