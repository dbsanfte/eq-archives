I do this because I feel obligated to my guild, guilds I am friends with, &lt;such as Forsaken Covenant&gt; and just the general population of good people here on lanys.<br>
<br>
I would like to let you know &lt;and beware&gt; of a player named Aaeilan.  I have known him for a few months, and originally welcomed him into my guild &lt;I am co-leader of Chaotic Senate&gt;.<br>
<br>
  As we do with many of our members, gear and money were loaned to him with the understanding they were to be returned as he was able to earn money to repay or upgrade the gear that was loaned to him.  <br>
<br>
Things went somewhat smoothly for a while...then they started going sour. He became derrogatory of me, guildmates, and guild whenever he would demand something and it was not immediately given him.  On occassion he asked me to tell high level players he was trust worthy and to loan him things, which troubled me.  I requested him not to ask for things from my friends that he could not possibly repay and that I would assist however I could to obtain what he wanted by other means, &lt;such as camping items, ect&gt;.  This angered him. Things went down hill fast. From this moment on, I saw little of the charming person I invited into my family, instead I met the real Aaeilan.<br>
<br>
As a druid,  I often help my lower seasoned guildmates level. This is a courtesy.  I do not take compensation and only ask they in turn help other guildmates if the need arises. <br>
<br>
Our guild is very much a &quot;family&quot;.  We stand together, hunt together and play together.  Even though many of us role play, we do not overstep the boundries of respect within our ranks, or out.  We pride ourselves on being honorable &lt;even our &quot;evil&quot; members&gt; for ourselves and our guild.<br>
<br>
The real problems started when I was unable to PL Aaeilan at his &quot;command&quot;  for a repeated session as another guildmate needed me for a corpse run.  Aaeilan became verbally abusive to me in tells, then took it to guild chat. &lt;please note this player was still in his probationary period, had violated some of the basic guild rules, was previously reprimanded by the other co-guild leader, and warned before this point for various problems with other guild members&gt;. <br>
<br>
Aaeilan proceeded to become slanderous, not only of me personally &lt;not in character role&gt;, but guildmates and the guild as a whole.  I asked him to remove himself if he was so unhappy and warned him  if he persisted with the foul language and gestures, I would remove him myself. With this conversation now being held in guild chat,several guildmates &lt;including co-leader Dramira&gt; interviened defending me as well as the guild, the problems escalated.  <br>
<br>
Aaeilan completely alianated himself beyond redemption.  He repeatedly harrassed myself and others to the point he was reported on several occassions to GM's on Lanys.  He was placed on ignore, so he began creating new characters to harrass us with, such as Soal.  <br>
<br>
I asked him to return the items loaned him &lt;which Dramira and I personally paid for for guild use&gt;.  His comment was &quot;F**K You, I am gonna sell them just to piss you off, good luck getting Sh*t!&quot;  He immediately went into anon status to conceal his location. It took approximately a week to chase down his character and remove him.<br>
<br>
In the weeks to come Aaielan's mood would flip flop dramatically.  One moment saying he was wrong, lets be friends, then the next &lt;without even taking a breath&gt;  abusive. I'm not sure who was more confused with his radical personality changes, me - or him.<br>
<br>
I became to dread getting tells from people I didn't know, as Aaeilan would pose new characters, then begin anew with his verbal abuse.  On one occassion he showed up as another character swearing to me it was Lannwen, &lt;of course this attempt was seen through readily as I know Lannwen, he is dear to me&gt;.  This false character was placed on ignore as well.<br>
<br>
He swore one day he would get back into my guild and I would never know.  Why someone, who swears they were so unhappy, would try to regain entry in guild is beyond me, but then so are his reactions that were more suited for a childs temper tantrum than an adult player that he claimed to be. <br>
<br>
&lt;Please note, I am not saying anything derrogatory about young people playing this game.  I think its a great social interaction for all.  We have several young people in our guild, some even call me EQ Mom affectionately and I love them dearly&gt;.<br>
<br>
Aaeilan has been out of my guild for weeks now, yet at times he still &quot;shows up&quot;.  Sometimes docile, but most times negative, slanderous and abusive.  He still has not returned the gear or the money.  <br>
<br>
Foresaken Covenant  &lt;which took him in unknowingly&gt; chose to honor his debt for him.  This was unexpected but very much appreciated, as well as speaking highly of FC's honor and respectability.  I have know Kaldaraa a long time, and met Avazon when he witnessed a heated conversation between Aaeilan and myself.  I am sorry to hear he has also caused these good people problems, they are my friends and allies, thus partially my reason behind this post.  <br>
<br>
Aaeilan has proven himself a liar, a cheat and abusive player.  I know now this was not something directed simply at me, as he continues to do similar actions against more and more people and guilds.<br>
<br>
Lanys is a great server, and almost every player here is helpful and friendly. So many of you have become dear friends, both in the EQ world and real life. Therefore this post is simply to let you beware, do not fall for Aaeilan's con like I did.  He will betray you, your friendship and your trust.  Hunt well and be safe all.<br>

I never saw this guy do anything I thought was wrong in guild chat, or mabey I just wasn't on when anything was going on.  Had he said anything any of us thought to be really screwed up, I think he would have left the guild crying.

ok merlina, hun we have been debating this character aaeilan for about a week now, and i cant be online too often, so the messages boards are my ears and eyes, and voice. We have come to an understanding that he will be removed, if he hasnt been already (not been online :P)<br>
<br>
i have a personal issue with him, in similar ways that you explained, and i didnt appriciate the things i have heard, and the aroused topics he has brought. from what i have seen he has been careless with his name, and attitude, and has not been regarding our guild first before he takes an action.<br>

Owens - Where exactly are you trying to take this?<br>
<br>
Seriously, what is your intention here.  Are you still crying over a couple levels?  You got your sword back, you got free levels, you got Kylians explanation.  Seems to me that this has become some sort of an obsession.<br>
<br>
Kylian would be the first to admit that we have somewhat of a past, nothing like what is being blamed on him via this 'new revelation', or your first alegation for that matter.  More like an agreement to disagree.  I say that because my intention here is not to defend him, more to know what YOU are thinking.<br>
<br>
Ok, so now you've shit listed him twice, the first really got you nowhere and I saw more support on Kylian's side that you should be happy with the results.  Now a second attack....  What in your opinion would be the 'perfect' outcome here?<br>
<br>
I just went back to review your original post, and it seems to have been deleted....  Is that what this is about?<br>
<br>
I went back because as I recall, and I may be wrong here, Kylian indicated in one of his posts that part of the problem was that you expected him to drop everything at your command to come PL you, and harassed him over it if he didn't.  The more of these posts of yours I read the more inclined I am to believe that.<br>
<br>
IMHO, you should quit while you are ahead.<br>
