Guess what Chit...IMO, thats called a response not a flame.  I didnt see him slam you. I did however see you make false accusations and call names.  You demanded his response and you got one...then you harassed him because he responded in a way different from what you wanted??  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> enough I was told<br>
by Raedwulf that flamming 'Chiteng' isnt flamming someone. You didnt address that issue <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> And I need to address what he says why?  You are the one that brought this issue here not me.  I could care less if he tells you that.  Thats your problem and you brought it on your self.  You made a public post, certainly you expected others to respond one way or the other.<br>
<br>
We arent recruiting monks *now* what does that have to do with then?  Most guilds recruiting needs change within a months time.  You seem to have a problem understanding that time is relevant in many situations.  Weve just added 2 monks to our roster so no we prolly wont recruit more until they are settled in if we do at all.  So in answer to your question, what we infer from this is that you have no clue of what you are talking about and are attempting to make people look bad by with your lack of knowledge.<br>
<br>
And you are gonna tell me NOW the date of the posts?  Thats intelligent Chit.  But you still havent shown me the threads...I still have no way to know that you didnt provoke him like you did Til.  If you do provide proof now, I honestly cant tell you what will happen.  See, we have officers..and they vote on things.  Its not that often that Til doles out punishment without it being discusses amongst all the officers.  Who knows, they might say that being harassed publicly by you is punishment enough.  <br>
<br>
I will not drag what Hopp says onto this board.  Hopp didnt come here and stir up @#%$, you did.  What Hopp and the rest of the guild says is between Hopp and his guild.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Over 30 CE members heard his remarks. Are you telling me that they are all willing to lie about it? <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
No Chit, Im telling you that I have no idea what you are talking about and I was supposedly there.  Obviously I must not have thought it bad or didnt see it.  Perhaps if you didnt wait 5 months or however long it was to complain then maybe someone would remember what you are talking about.  We raid prolly 10 times a week...and you think Im gonna remember 1 sentence from months back?   ummm sorry guess I just have to let you down on that one..my memory is NOT that good.  It doesnt sound like yours is either since you have yet to tell me exactly what was said.<br>

If that is the case, isn't the person agreeing with you partisan, just partisan in your favor?  Sorry, it's not a test of integrity to simply state what one thinks on this board.  As this board has absolutely no effect except upon the lunatic fringe (you, Shardon, Mitch, Madprops), there is no issue of integrity.<br>
<br>
Likewise, there is no issue of loyalty.  Aside from you, no one has ever raised the issue of &quot;loyalty&quot; on this board.  It's meaningless, just like all the rest of your ranting.<br>
<br>
Where have I shouted down any &quot;opposition?&quot;  Based upon post counts, you've got me 3 to 1 over the last couple days.  Who's shouting?<br>
<br>
As for being polarized, depends upon the subject.  In this one, whether or not you were harassed on a raid, the answer is either yes or no.  Kinda hard not to be polarized when the choices are so limited.<br>
<br>
No one emotionally blackmails anyone around here.  You are a joke for even suggesting it.  I'm sure lots of people busted a gut laughing at you on that one.  Again.  To suggest you are morally better than anyone around here based upon message board conduct (aside from the racist fools we occasionally get), is the height of delusional paranoia.<br>
<br>
And yes, you lied.  You claimed you quoted from the email that answered Ysall's question.  However, as nothing you &quot;quoted&quot; said anything about the alleged Raid Harassment, and only more of your ostrich-like misinterpretation of the guild policy, your claim that you answered Ysall was a lie.<br>

There are in excess of 26 pages visible on the R&amp;F<br>
board.<br>
<br>
All you need to do is go to each individual page<br>
and hit 'search' then type 'Hoppkins' in the first<br>
box.<br>
<br>
You will get an eye opener about how much your<br>
'valued cleric' obeys the guild policy.<br>

Chit, even if it does contain what you say, when you complained and were asked for proof you provided none.  We dont reprimand people for nothing.  It took you coming here and slinging mud around before you ever bothered to attempt to prove your side.  <br>

<br>
No, thats not true. a good guild member helps his guild. A good guild member doesnt cause problems within the guild structure. You have a problem with Hoppkins, fine, this is the guilds responsibilty why? did you expect them to punish him becuase you dislike him?  If he did something against you , its your obligation to take care of it. Its not the guildleader. its not the other officers its you Chiteng's responsibility. <br>
<br>
What you should have done is send a direct tell to hoppkins, ask him directly wtf is his problem. If he ignores you  then you tell him to stay out of your way and youll stay out of his.  wow end of argument. no emails. no ezboard drama. no losing of guild tags. you notice hair begind to grow on your testes and your voice gets deeper.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Your a good guild member right Chuk? You would never make a mess that your guild would have to clean up RIGHT?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Yes, im an extremely loyal member to my guild.  I am there for them in the good and bad times and they will always be there for me. I have no problems for them to clean up. i dont train people  nor do i KS them. The trouble i start on this board is believe it or not just fun for me. It may be serious business for you but i really could care less about anyone who posts here. if i interact with them in game thats a different story. here its like who gives a fook.<br>
