(slaughter). This includes the infamous &quot;highway of death&quot; in the last days of the slaughter when U.S. pilots literally shot in the back retreating Iraqi civilians and conscripted soldiers. I continue to be horrified by the sanctions on Iraq, which have resulted in the death of over 1,000,000 Iraqis, including over 500,000 children, about whom former Secretary of State Madeline Allbright has stated that their deaths &quot;are worth the cost&quot;. <br><br>Over the course of my life I have been shocked and horrified by a variety of U.S. governmental actions, such as the U.S. sponsored coup against democracy in Guatemala in 1954 which resulted in the deaths of over 120,000 Guatemalan peasants by U.S. installed dictatorships over the course of four decades. <br><br>Last Tuesday's events reminded me of the horror I felt when the U.S. overthrew the governments of the Dominican Republic in 1965 and helped to murder 3,000 people. And it reminded me of the shock I felt in 1973, when the U.S. sponsored a coup in Chile against the democratic government of Salvador Allende and helped to murder another 30,000 people, including U.S. citizens. <br><br>Last Tuesday's events reminded me of the shock and horror I felt in 1965 when the U.S. sponsored a coup in Indonesia that resulted in the murder of over 800,000 people, and the subsequent slaughter in 1975 of over 250,000 innocent people in East Timor by the Indonesian regime with th direct complicity of President Ford and Secretary of State Henry Kissenger. <br><br>I was reminded of the shock and horror I felt during the U.S. sponsored terrorist contra war (the World Court declared the U.S. government a war criminal in 1984 for the mining of the harbors) against Nicaragua in the 1980s which resulted in the deaths of over 30,000 innocent people (or as the U.S. government used to call them before the term &quot;collateral amage&quot; was invented--&quot;soft targets&quot;). <br><br>I was reminded of being horrified by the U. S. war against the people of El Salvador in the 1980s, which resulted in the brutal deaths of over 80,000 people, or &quot;soft targets&quot;. <br><br>I was reminded of the shock and horror I felt during the U.S. sponsored terror war against the peoples of southern Africa (especially Angola) that began in the 1970's and continues to this day and has resulted in the deaths and mutilations of over 1,000,000. I was reminded of the shock and horror I felt as the U.S. invaded Panama over the Christmas season of 1989 and killed over 8,000 in an attempt to capture George H. Bush's CIA partner, now turned enemy, Manual Noriega. <br><br>I was reminded of the horror I felt when I learned about how the Shah of Iran was installed in a U.S. sponsored brutal coup that resulted in the deaths of over 70,000 Iranians from 1952-1979. And the continuing shock as I learned that the Ayatollah Khomani, who overthrew the Shah in 1979, and who was the U.S. public enemy for decade of the 1980s, was also on the CIA payroll, while he was in exile in Paris in the 1970s. <br><br>I was reminded of the shock and horror that I felt as I learned about how the U.S. has &quot;manufactured consent&quot; since 1948 for its support of Israel, to the exclusion of virtually any rights for the Palestinians in their native lands resulting in ever worsening day-to-day conditions for the people of Palestine. I was shocked as I learned about the hundreds of towns and villages that were literally wiped off the face of the earth in the early days of Israeli colonization. I was horrified in 1982 as the villagers of Sabra and Shatila were massacred by Israeli allies with direct Israeli complicity and direction. The untold thousands who died on that day match the scene of horror that we saw last Tuesday. But those scenes were not repeated over and over again on the national media to inflame the American public. <br><br>The events and images of last Tuesday have been appropriately compared to the horrific events and images of Lebanon in the 1980s with resulted in the deaths of tens of thousand of people, with no reference to the fact that the country that inflicted the terror on Lebanon was Israel, with U.S. backing. I still continue to be shocked at how mainstream commentators refer to &quot;Israeli settlers&quot; in the &quot;occupied territories&quot; with no sense of irony as they report on who are the aggressors in the region. <br><br>Of course, the largest and most shocking war crime of the second half of the 20th century was the U.S. assault on Indochina from 1954-1975, especially Vietnam, where over 4,000,000 people were bombed, napalmed, crushed, shot and individually &quot;hands on&quot; murdered in the &quot;Phoenix Program&quot; (this is where Oliver North got his start). Many U.S. Vietnam veterans were also victimized by this war and had the best of intentions, but the policy makers themselves knew the criminality of their actions and policies as revealed in their own words in &quot;The Pentagon Papers,&quot; released by Daniel Ellsberg of the RAND Corporation. In 1974 Ellsberg noted that our Presidents from Truman to Nixon continually lied to the U.S. public about the purpose and conduct of the war. He has stated that, &quot;It is a tribute to the American people that our leaders perceived that they had to lie to us, it is not a tribute to us that we were so easily misled.&quot; <br><br>I was continually shocked and horrified as the U.S. attacked and bombed with impunity the nation of Libya in the 1980s, including killing the infant daughter of Khadafi. I was shocked as the U.S. bombed and invaded Grenada in 1983. I was horrified by U.S. military and CIA actions in Somalia, Haiti, Afghanistan, Sudan, Brazil, Argentina, and Yugoslavia. The deaths in these actions ran into the hundreds of thousands. <br><br>The above list is by no means complete or comprehensive. It is merely a list that is easily accessible and not unknown, especially to the economic and intellectual elites. It has just been conveniently eliminated from the public discourse and public consciousness. And for the most part, the analysis that the U.S. actions have resulted in the deaths of primarily civilians (over 90%) is not unknown to these elites and policy makers. A conservative number for those who have been killed by U.S. terror and military action since World War II is 8,000,000 people. Repeat--8,000,000 people. This does not include the wounded, the imprisoned, the displaced, the refugees, etc. Martin Luther King, Jr. stated in 1967, during the Vietnam War, &quot;My government is the world's leading purveyor of violence.&quot; <br><br>Shocking and horrifying. <br><br>Nothing that I have written is meant to disparage or disrespect those who were victims and those who suffered death or the loss of a loved one during this week's events. It is not meant to &quot;justify&quot; any action by those who bombed the Twin Towers or the Pentagon. It is meant to put it in a context. If we believe that the actions were those of &quot;madmen&quot;, they are &quot;madmen&quot; who are able to keep a secret for 2 years or more among over 100 people, as they trained to execute a complex plan. While not the acts of madmen, they are apparently the acts of &quot;fanatics&quot; who, depending on who they really are, can find real grievances, but whose actions are illegitimate. <br><br>Osama Bin Laden at this point has been accused by the media and the government of being the mastermind of Tuesday's bombings. Given the government's track record on lying to the America people, that should not be accepted as fact at this time. If indeed Bin Laden is the mastermind of this action, he is responsible for the deaths of perhaps 10,000 people-a shocking and horrible crime. Ed Herman in his book The Real Terror Network: Terrorism in Fact and Propaganda does not justify any terrorism but points out that states often engage in &quot;wholesale&quot; terror, while those whom governments define as &quot;terrorist&quot; engage is &quot;retail&quot; terrorism. While qualitatively the results are the same for the individual victims of terrorism, there is a clear quantitative difference. And as Herman and others point out, the seeds, the roots, of much of the &quot;retail&quot; terror are in fact found in the &quot;wholesale&quot; terror of states. Again this is not to justify, in any way, the actions of last Tuesday, but to put them in a context and suggest an explanation. <br><br>Perhaps most shocking and horrific, if indeed Bin Laden is the mastermind of Tuesday's actions; he has clearly had significant training in logistics, armaments, and military training, etc. by competent and expert military personnel. And indeed he has. During the 1980s, he was recruited, trained and funded by the CIA in Afghanistan to fight against the Russians. As long as he visited his terror on Russians and his enemies in Afghanistan, he was &quot;our man&quot; in that country. <br><br>The same is true of Saddam Hussein of Iraq, who was a CIA asset in Iraq during the 1980s. Hussein could gas his own people, repress the population, and invade his neighbor (Iran) as long as he did it with U.S. approval. <br><br>The same was true of Manuel Noriega of Panama, who was a contemporary and CIA partner of George H. Bush in the 1980s. Noriega's main crime for Bush, the father, was not that he dealt drugs (he did, but the U.S. and Bush knew this before 1989), but that Noriega was no longer going to cooperate in the ongoing U.S. terrorist contra war against Nicaragua. This information is not unknown or really controversial among elite policy makers. To repeat, this not to justify any of the actions of last Tuesday, but to put it in its horrifying context. <br><br>As shocking as the events of last Tuesday were, they are likely to generate even more horrific actions by the U.S. government that will add significantly to the 8,000,000 figure stated above. This response may well be qualitatively and quantitatively worst than the events of Tuesday. The New York Times headline of 9/14/01 states that, &quot;Bush AndTop Aides Proclaim Policy Of Ending States That Back Terror&quot; as if that was a rationale, measured, or even sane option. States that have been identified for possible elimination are &quot;a number of Asian and African countries, like Afghanistan, Iraq, Sudan, and even Pakistan.&quot; This is beyond shocking and horrific-it is just as potentially suicidal, homicidal, and more insane than the hijackers themselves. <br><br>Also, qualitatively, these actions will be even worse than the original bombers if one accepts the mainstream premise that those involved are &quot;madmen&quot;, &quot;religious fanatics&quot;, or a &quot;terrorist group.&quot; If so, they are acting as either individuals or as a small group. The U.S. actions may continue the homicidal policies of a few thousand elites for the past 50 years, involving both political parties. <br><br>The retail terror is that of desperate and sometime fanatical small groups and individuals who often have legitimate grievances, but engage in individual criminal and illegitimate activities; the wholesale terror is that of &quot;rational&quot; educated men where the pain, suffering, and deaths of millions of people are contemplated, planned, and too often, executed, for the purpose of furthering a nebulous concept called the &quot;national interest&quot;. Space does not allow a full explanation of the elites Orwellian concept of the &quot;national interest&quot;, but it can be summarized as the protection and expansion of hegemony and an imperial empire. <br><br>The American public is being prepared for war while being fed a continuous stream of shocking and horrific repeated images of Tuesday's events and heartfelt stories from the survivors and the loved ones of those who lost family members. These stories are real and should not be diminished. In fact, those who lost family members can be considered a representative sample of humanity of the 8,000,000 who have been lost previously. If we multiply by 800-1000 times the amount of pain, angst, and anger being currently felt by the American public, we might begin to understand how much of the rest of the world feels as they are continually victimized. <br><br>Some particularly poignant images are the heart wrenching public stories that we are seeing and hearing of family members with pictures and flyers searching for their loved ones. These images are virtually the same as those of the &quot;Mothers of the Disappeared&quot; who searched for their (primarily) adult children in places such as Argentina, where over 11,000 were &quot;disappeared&quot; in 1976-1982, again with U.S. approval. Just as the mothers of Argentina deserved our respect and compassion, so do the relatives of those who are searching for their relatives now. However we should not allow ourselves to be manipulated by the media and U.S. government into turning real grief and anger into a national policy of wholesale terror and genocide against innocent civilians in Asia and Africa. What we are seeing in military terms is called &quot;softening the target.&quot; The target here is the American public and we are being ideologically and emotionally prepared for the slaughter that may commence soon. <br><br>None of the previously identified Asian and African countries are democracies, which means that the people of these countries have virtually no impact on developing the policies of their governments, even if we assume that these governments are complicit in Tuesday'sactions. When one examines the recent history of these countries, one will find that the American government had direct and indirect influences on creating the conditions for the existence of some of these governments. This is especially true of the Taliban government of Afghanistan itself. <br><br>The New York Metropolitan Area has about 21,000,000 people or about 8 % of the U.S. population. Almost everyone in America knows someone who has been killed, injured or traumatized by the events of Tuesday. I know that I do. Many people are calling for &quot;revenge&quot; or &quot;vengeance&quot; and comments such as &quot;kill them all&quot; have been circulated on the TV, radio, and email. A few more potentially benign comments have called &quot;justice.&quot; This is only potentially benign since that term may be defined by people such as Bush and Colin Powell. Powell is an unrepentant participant in the Vietnam War, the terrorist contra war against Nicaragua, and the Gulf war, at each level becoming more responsible for the planning and execution of the policies. <br><br>Those affected, all of us, must do everything in our power to prevent a wider war and even greater atrocity, do everything possible to stop the genocide if it starts, and hold those responsible for their potential war crimes during and after the war. If there is a great war in 2001 and it is not catastrophic (a real possibility), the crimes of that war will be revisited upon the U.S. over the next generation. That is not some kind of religious prophecy or threat, it is merely a straightforward political analysis. If indeed it is Bin Laden, the world must not deal only with him as an individual criminal, but eliminate the conditions that create the injustices and war crimes that will inevitably lead to more of these types of attacks in the future. The phrase &quot;No Justice, No Peace&quot; is more than a slogan used in a march, it is an observable historical fact. It is time to end the horror. <br><br>In a few short pages it is impossible to delineate all of the events described over the past week or to give a comprehensive accounting of U.S. foreign policy.

However, there is an old saying 'if you arent part of the solution, youre part of the problem'.  The views a lot of people express over US foreign policy are entirely one-sided and only look at the surface.  <br><br>  In some places in this writing, the US is chastised for inaction and the deaths of 'innocents' placed on our table even though said deaths resulted without any participation or action from the US.  In other cases, the US chooses to back one or the other parties in other countries and is once again villified by those same parties.  This paradox defies any sense of logic.<br><br>  Using such logic it is a lose-lose situation for the US.  If we do anything, or if we do nothing, we are somehow to blame for whatever occurs in other countries.   So in some sense, it matters not what we do for blame will be set on us by some people regardless of our action or lack of action. <br><br>Left entirely to their own destiny after being liberated from Soviet occupation, you see what happens in Afghanistan.  Somehow the US is being blamed for not rebuilding their country after the occupation of the Soviets.  And yet, if we had gone in and helped them setup a democratic govornment we would have most likely been demonized for setting up satellite countries.<br><br>    In the 1980s, Khadafi financed terrorist attacks on commercial jet liners and other civilian targets, and as a result of those terrorist actions he was overtly 'provoked' by US naval forces sailing in international waters ( as defined by the UN ).  He attacked our navy in international waters, something which 50 years ago would have been an act of war.  We destroyed much of his air force and left it at that.  Yet this is now somehow an evil act by the US?<br><br>  The bottom line is that most of these govornments that are 'backed' by the US according to this 'writer' were not set up by the US govornment.  These govornments existed without our help, and I think the US (logically) goes on the assumption that whatever the current govornment in a country is, is who we deal with.  If they are friendly to us, we help them.  If they are not friendly, we do not help them.  If they are directly opposed to US interests, we fight them.  <br><br> The simple reality of the situation is that many countries have too many radical elements to have any hope of becoming democratic.  Afghanistan is a good example - who do you want in charge, the Taliban or the Northern Alliance?  Anyone here dumb enough to think the Northern Alliance will set up a democracy without a lot of serious arm twisting?  Anyone here think a democracy in Afghanistan will stand, even if it is setup?  Anyone think the rest of the middle east wont howl bloody murder if the US tries to help Afghanistan set up a new govornment?  The most the US can hope is to have a friendly or at least neutral govornment in Afghanistan.  <br><br><br>-Dakinis / Teer (Retired / Retired)<br><br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uraedwulf.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Raedwulf</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 332<br> <font color=#E9D756>(10/10/01 12:53:45 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=208.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> The Solution</span><hr size=1> WarAngel1:  I disagree with a number of your statements.<br><br><!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> 'if you arent part of the solution, youre part of the problem'<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>I turned 18 in 1983.

Again, Mr. Chomsky has provided the facts, in order to rebut his claims, facts are necessary.  If you read some history other than from Mr. Limbaugh, you'll find that he is correct that we sponsored the coups in Iran, Guatemala, Chile and other places that resulted in the overthrow of legitimate (even democratic) governments, just because they chose to ally with the Soviet Union rather than the US.  That is simply not jusitifiable.<br><br>I disagree with Mr. Chomsky on Libya, Kosovo and the Gulf War, but most of the rest of his criticism of past US policy is quite valid.  I also disagree with some of his criticism of the present effort against Afghanistan.  That country's present leadership has supported terrorists and we must make a strong effort to stop that.<br><br>No one is suggesting that we force a democracy on Afghanistan.  The point of the article is merely to point out, correctly, that we aren't absolutely innocent of our own bad acts against civilian populations.

Listing a series of countries and numerical figures of the dead, and attributing them to the USA, is NOT listing FACTS.   This is probably why no one bothered to post to this thread - its all rhetoric in the original post.  NO FACT AT ALL.<br><br>However, the simple FACT that you blindly follow his conclusions, baseless as they are, shows where your loyalty is (or rather is not) and how easily you have been brainwashed.<br><br>Herein lies the meaning behind my statement :<br>'if you arent part of the solution, youre part of the problem'<br><br>If you don't know the difference between facts and rhetoric, you are a major part of the problem.  <br><br>Every issue Chomsky lists is extremely complex, yet he simplifies it to a level most mentally challenged folks can undesterdand : give a body count and point a finger.  If that's as deep as your thought process goes, then there is no point discussing it with you.   You will simply choose to believe what you want to believe.  <br><br>My point is not that I know the answers, my point is that even a cursory look at any of these issues shows they are a lot more complex than assigning simple blame.  You can write a book on most of the issues he mentions, and books have been written about most of them.<br><br>I'll take one(1) of the things he lies at the feet of America, the Shah of Iran.   I like this one, because I had a friend in college who was from Iran and she told me some things about the new religious state since the Shah fell from power.  Suffice it to say she did not like the new regime.<br><br>Do you know anything about Iran?  Did you know the Shah ruled for 26 years?  Do you know who ruled Iran prior to the Shah, how they treated their people, and how the Shah treated people?  No?  But you are willing to buy off on assigning the murder of 70,000 Iranians to the USA, just because Chomsky wrote that number down and pointed a finger at the USA?<br><br>The blanket blame is laid at the US for 70,000 deaths in a rebellion against the Shah's predecessor.  I contend that the Shah really didnt have a predecessor in the way Chomsky says, based on the FACTS of history.<br><br>&quot;Subsequent negotiations with the AIOC were unsuccessful, partly because General Ali Razmara, who became prime minister in June 1950, failed to persuade the oil company of the strength of nationalist feeling in the country and<br>in the Majlis. When the AIOC finally offered fifty-fifty profit-sharing in February 1951, sentiment for nationalization of the oil industry had become widespread. Razmara advised against nationalization on technical grounds and<br>was assassinated in March 1951 by Khalil Tahmasebi, a member of the militant Fadayan-e Islam. On March 15, the Majlis voted to nationalize the oil industry. In April the shah yielded to Majlis pressure and demonstrations in the<br>streets by naming Mossadeq prime minister. &quot;<br><br>So, the Shah's 'predecessor' came to power via.. assasination.  And was, in fact, appointed by the Shah (who could in fact appoint anyone he chose).<br><br><br>Here is a little snippet about how democracy was expunged from Iran, not by the Shah but by his 'predecessor' :<br><br>&quot;As domestic conditions deteriorated, however, Mossadeq's populist style grew more autocratic. In August 1952, the Majlis acceded to his demand for full powers in all affairs of government for a six-month period. These special powers were subsequently extended for a further six-month term. He also obtained approval for a law to reduce, from six years to two years, the term of the Senate (established in 1950 as the upper house of the Majlis), and thus brought about the dissolution of that body. Mossadeq's support in the lower house of the Majlis (also called the Majlis) was dwindling, however, so on August 3, 1953, the prime minister organized a plebiscite for the dissolution of the Majlis, claimed a massive vote in favor of the proposal, and dissolved the legislative body. &quot;<br><br>Oh and did I mention,  the oil industry in Iran had been nationalized by &quot;Mossadeq&quot;?  BTW, the oil industry in Iran mostly belonged to the British.  That would sort of be like Saudi Arabia ejecting Exxon from their country and claiming all of Exxons private property for themselves.  Imagine the economic and social turmoil that generated in England.<br><br>&quot;The administration of President Harry S Truman initially had been sympathetic to Iran's nationalist aspirations. Under the administration of President Dwight D. Eisenhower, however, the United States came to accept the view of the British government that no reasonable compromise with Mossadeq was possible and that, by working with the Tudeh, Mossadeq was making probable a communist-inspired takeover. Mossadeq's intransigence and inclination to accept Tudeh support, the Cold War atmosphere, and the fear of Soviet influence in Iran also shaped United States thinking. In June 1953, the Eisenhower administration approved a British proposal for a joint Anglo-American operation, code-named Operation Ajax, to overthrow Mossadeq. Kermit Roosevelt of the United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) traveled secretly to Iran to coordinate plans with the shah and the Iranian military, which was led by General Fazlollah Zahedi. &quot;<br><br>So that is how the Shah came into power.  But wait, thats not exacly right.  The Shah was the one who gave power to and in fact appointed &quot;Mossadeq&quot; his supposed predecessor.  So, the Shah must have been in power already, right?  I'll leave that one for you to think about.<br><br>As far as what the Shah did while in power - Education reform, extended womens rights, freed the press, and repaired the economy after Mossadeq's nationalization had wrecked it.  Iran became one of the wealthiest and best-educated middle eastern countries.  <br><br>So how dide he fall from power :<br>&quot;By late 1976 and early 1977, it was evident that the Iranian economy was in trouble. The shah's attempt to use Iran's vastly expanded oil revenues after 1973 for an unrealistically ambitious industrial and construction program and<br>a massive military buildup greatly strained Iran's human and institutional resources and caused severe economic and social dislocation. Widespread official corruption, rapid inflation, and a growing gap in incomes between the<br>wealthier and the poorer strata of society fed public dissatisfaction. <br><br>In response, the government attempted to provide the working and middle classes with some immediate and tangible benefits of the country's new oil wealth. The government nationalized private secondary schools, declared that<br>secondary education would be free for all Iranians, and started a free meal program in schools. It took over private community colleges and extended financial support to university students. It lowered income taxes, inaugurated<br>an ambitious health insurance plan, and speeded up implementation of a program introduced in 1972, under which industrialists were required to sell 49 percent of the shares of their companies to their employees. The programs<br>were badly implemented, however, and did not adequately compensate for the deteriorating economic position of the urban working class and those, who, like civil servants, were on fixed salaries. To deal with the disruptive<br>effects of excessive spending, the government adopted policies that appeared threatening to the propertied classes and to bazaar, business, and industrial elements who had benefited from economic expansion and might have<br>been expected to support the regime. For example, in an effort to bring down rents, municipalities were empowered to take over empty houses and apartments and to rent and administer them in place of the owners. In an effort to<br>bring down prices in 1975 and 1976, the government declared a war on profiteers, arrested and fined thousands of shopkeepers and petty merchants, and sent two prominent industrialists into exile. <br><br>Moreover, by 1978 there were 60,000 foreigners in Iran--45,000 of them Americans--engaged in business or in military training and advisory missions. Combined with a superficial Westernization evident in dress, life styles, music,<br>films, and television programs, this foreign presence tended to intensify the perception that the shah's modernization program was threatening the society's Islamic and Iranian cultural values and identity.&quot;<br><br>Bottom line : the economy went bad and they didnt like the West - it went against Islam.<br><br>It's worth noting that the fall of the Shah and the rise of the Ayatollah was followed by years of war with Iraq.  They Ayatollah needed a war to fight to stay in power.<br><br>My thought is that Chomsky is like a reverse Joe McCarthy, instead of stirring up americans to hate communists Chomsky stirs up Americans to hate themselves.  Its a really easy tactic: tell people a few lies, mix in a few truths and whole hell of a lot of half-truths and do so in such quantity that by the time some of your points are disproven you've already told 100 more lies.
