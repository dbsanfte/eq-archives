<br>
Welcome to the real world. Customer Service is a loss to a company. They have proportioned CS to the number of customers they have like any other company. It's based on a business model. Microsoft probably has 150 to 200 million customers world-wide. Do you think they have 1-2 CS staff per 2000 customers?<br>

No, I didn't.  I do think many have reasons other than just the kindness of their heart for why they are guides however.  There's nothing wrong with that.  Everyone has their reasons.  I was only disagreeing with that statement, not trying to make guides look bad for their reasoning behind it.  Sorry if it came across that way.  <br>
<br>
I have know people irl that are guides however.  Like I stated before, one <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>was</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> a good friend of mine.  He did end up being the type that stopped going to work and stopped paying his bills and played EQ a good majority of the day.  I think we've all heard stories of these types of things happening with this game.  A lot of people probably actually know someone that has had this happen before or at least something similar to it.<br>
<br>
Everyone has different experiences with the guides.  I've had some good, some bad.  I've never had any major issues that needed attention from guides, but have had a few minor ones.  This isn't something I'm going to hold a grudge about just because of this.  I'm more upset at the major problems that have never been dealt with for friends of mine.  I wouldn't say I've ever really been &quot;screwed over&quot; by a guide before, but do know a lot of people both irl and ig that have.  I'm tired of the whole attitude that it's ok for them to screw people over because they are volunteers.<br>
<br>
They ARE customer service representatives and do have a responsibility to that.  I don't buy the whole &quot;Well, I'm a volunteer so I don't have to do everything that is expected of me.&quot;  <br>
<br>
I also realize that their power is limited.  I didn't say they had any massive amount of power.  I'm sorry if you interpretted it that way.  But they have a lot more power in that game then any of the rest of us do.  There's a lot of people that are happy any amount of power.  Not everyone wants to rule the world.  And they may have one account for play and one account for their guide, I realize that, but that's one more free play account then the rest of us have also.<br>
<br>
Not everything I wrote was well thought out.  This is Rants and Flames however, and ranting usually isn't well thought out.  As I said, this had been building for quite some time and I finally just released it.<br>

During my time as a Guide I learned to take &quot;friends of mine&quot; stories with a grain of salt. Several times I would be IA with a fellow Guide, to observe to problem, and later in the evening get petitions from &quot;friends&quot; who would tell a diffrent story than what transpired. When I asked them if they were present the usual answer was &quot;No but my friend told me what happened.&quot;<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> They ARE customer service representatives and do have a responsibility to that. I don't buy the whole &quot;Well, I'm a volunteer so I don't have to do everything that is expected of me.&quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
What responsibility do they have as CSR? What do you think is expected from them?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> ...And they may have one account for play and one account for their guide, I realize that, but that's one more free play account then the rest of us have also.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
And with that account comes the knowledge that your actions are held to a higher standard. You understand that if you seriously fuck up, while Guiding, you will be tossed from the program and your play account will be suspended or banned. You understand that your actions on your play account can have repricusions to your Guide status. Being a Guide is a double edged sword. You get the perks of a free account, going into zones that most people will never see, and possible being witness to EQ first. But you also have your actions viewed with a magnigying glass.<br>
<br>
<br>
I think Celdor summed it up the best:<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> My suggestion to anyone who thinks a free account or power is worth being a guide and the crap that comes with it, go and sign up and guide for a while. Then come talk about it.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Things that were NOT complained about:<br>
<br>
1) no guides on Thanksgiving.  Unless I misread his numerous attemots to say it: He didn't even try to petition then, he came back another day.  The other days of the year falling into the category of &quot;Days that are NOT, in fact, Thanksgiving.&quot;<br>
<br>
2) ANY particular guide being a tool (this would be where it becomes unecesary for us to read Tweety's first rant for the 965784743736326th time)<br>
<br>
Things that WERE complained about: <br>
<br>
1) Verants lack of any desire to help or hire the help that software of this quality and type requires to deliver promised product.<br>
<br>
2) Our GM who may or may not actually exist (little has ever been done to prove or disprove theories).<br>
<br>
<br>
Sorry, but I don't care if you think guides are gods chosen messengers on Earth.  I personally think Tweety is the best thing since chocolate chip cookies, even so...if you think the Verant system of CS is even slightly better than dog vomit...you're laughable at best.<br>

I will be pleasantly surprised if the lost stuff is ever returned at all.  I know people who, in similar situations did not get thier gear back.<br>

I think every guide or ex-guide would agree that Tweety's rant was the best thing since chocolate chip cookies, what I am saying is don't be mad at guides be mad at Verant. <p><center><img src="http://users.bigpond.com/raymies/newsig.jpg">
