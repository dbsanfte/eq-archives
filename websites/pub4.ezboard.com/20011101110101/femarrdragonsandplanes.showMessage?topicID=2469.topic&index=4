If this is the case, wouldn't Landario not sat down and talked to Toran about it? But he did and they talked. When we initially ported up, Landario asked 3 times in say what you were after. But you sat there and stared at us. You were sitting there doing nothing at all. <br>
<br>
As a matter of fact we were taking the LoF people along to get their FA's (I believe that was what they were after?).<br>
<br>
It's a shame that you logged off in a huff, or you might have got the ranger belt that dropped instead of it decaying. -sighs-<br>

So I'm the worst person there so I get listed twice? Bleh.<br>

<br>
Nickoli i don't know you but that post makes you look like an Idiot. The fact that you refer to the WTC incident is also not very stylish but well.<br>
<br>
As you know, we were gathering in SRO and talked in Say mode about POA and your people were sitting right next to us.<br>
When we asked them if they were also heading to POA they said &quot;No we head to hate&quot; and ported.<br>
<br>
10 mins later i see those same Peoples sitting on the first island in POA doing nothing but watching the Faeries.<br>
<br>
Two officers of us(Stumpf and me) grouped with two officers(?) of your guild and talked with them for about one hour.<br>
<br>
Your members said their main goal is the FA for Toran, so we said we get him up there with us to get his FA. We also said that we only want to get mobs on 4th and 5th island for epics and you guys said you don't need those.<br>
<br>
The problem was that your guild could not agree on anything.<br>
<br>
Your last suggestion was that we have to take a group of your guild along to get exp and all items(dunno which items...guess quest pieces) from island 1 to 4 and that we let you get our next Venril Sathir in the rotation.<br>
<br>
By that time i had talked for more than one hour with you guys and then we decided to just move on.<br>
<br>
Sorry if you got the impression that we are evil Overlords but maybe you should look into the mirror first.<br>
<br>
And again refering to the WTC incident makes you look like a jackass.<br>
<br>
Toran you are a good guy, i told you we take you along to get your FA and that offer still stands.<br>
<br>
Landario<br>
<br>
PS: If you make a list of disrespectful People make sure you don't list them twice...<br>

<br>
A)  Affliction was in Sro the same time you guys were<br>
B)  NOONE was in Sky.  Including LoF so don't try to fool others.<br>
C)  Affliction ASKED LoF what their plans were.  LoF replied they were going to HATE.  Yes HATE, not Sky.  <br>
D)  Once everyone got up there and started killing faeries and the clusterfuck began, we TRIED to talk with you and work out a reasonable alternative.  We wanted Isle 4 and the KoS.  Nothing else.  You're &quot;suggestion&quot; was to 1) Bring your entire raid force with us.  2) have us Corpse summon/island hop your entire raid to every island we went to 3) Make a stop by Noble Isle to get a monk his epic piece 4) Get 2 people their FA pieces 5) Let your guys get all the kills (for the XP) 6) Let your guys get ALL the loots that dropped aside from a cape if it dropped from KoS 6) Let you guys take our Next VS /boggle.  7) Oh, did I mention island hop all their corpses across every island even though they had 1 necro who can't use small coffins, but, well, they had no coffins at all anyways.<br>
E)  We offered to take your entire raid force with us.  Including Summoning corpses to each island.  You wouldn't accept that.<br>
F)  We offered to take 1 or 2 groups along with us to get your Pallys and Monk their epic pieces.  You wouldn't accept that.<br>
G)  You sat around making demands to us that we could not accept AFTER you had lied to us about your intentions to go up.  We had our force there ready to move/fight.  We offered solutions that were more than fair yet you would not accept them.  So, we moved on to our goals.<br>
<br>
Yea, well, then the whole fuckup thing with Sirran on 3rd Island.  One of our Genius' forgot not to use /say around Sirran and despawned him before everyone got keys or even 1 necro that could get corpses to the next island.  That screwed everything for everyone there.  So, we left, disappointed at the entire thing.<br>
<br>
Anyways, I will admit it was a hugely clusterfucked ordeal.  However, before you come off claiming all the &quot;bad people&quot; of affliction or the &quot;disrespectfuls&quot; please do us all a favor and tell things fully for what they are worth. <br>
<br>

Makes your guild sound like newbies... You wanted them you what, corpse hop 4 groups? on every island? That's like.. around 8k or so.. Then again it's not that much... but from what i've gathered you guys are really greedy....  For not even being up there first.. <p>     Dauragon C. Mikado
