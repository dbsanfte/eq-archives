It's clear it's had a very scarring impact upon you and I'm sorry for that.  Please don't hold the actions of one person or group against everyone professing a similar faith.  We don't blame all Arabs or Muslims because one small group has done evil, so it's not fair for you to hold all &quot;Christians&quot; accountable for the actions of others.<br>
<br>
I'm sorry that you can't grasp the concept of &quot;faith.&quot;  It is an integral part of Christ's teaching that there is but one way to God, and that is to be one of His followers.  [Same holds true for Islam, Judaism and the various splinter groups from them.  To a certain degree, the same holds true for Hinduism and Buddhism, although they're a bit more tenuous in their adherence to the proposition.]  As a result, if you believe, then you must accept that premise.  I could go through all sorts of Biblical and other proofs supporting that idea, but I can see that's not going to be meaningful for you.  [If Christ's death wasn't necessary for salvation, then the sacrifice involved becomes meaningless.]<br>
<br>
You seem to be advocating the kind of relativism that keeps popping up on this board whenever religion or faith is mentioned.  If you believe the world is flat, and I believe the world is round, we can't both be right.<br>
<br>
Please explain what you mean by the comment that advocating for others to convert is somehow contradictory to that same belief.  That comment doesn't make sense to me.  If I believe that U2 is the best rock and roll band in history, am I contradicting myself in advocating for others to appreciate the nuances of the The Edge's guitarosity?<br>
<br>

I can believe fine without telling others about it.  It would be an empty and a shallow thing if the joy I've found wasn't shared with others.  When you first started playing EQ, didn't you want to share it with others?  Isn't the game tremendously more fun if you are playing with others?  Why should &quot;faith&quot; be any different?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Go back to the faithless religious pit you crawled from<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->  Absolutely non-sensical.  Perhaps you ought to stop drinking caffeine.<br>

This was an interesting comment, despite the fact that most of it doesn't make any sense.  Where do you get this stuff?  I've got children and lots of experience with other kids.  There is nothing pure about their spirit at birth.  I don't presume that the Holy Spirit dwells in anyone, absent their choice to invite Christ into their lives.  If someone has chosen another spirit, then they are mistaken.  Your comments regarding adjudicating and earthly primacy supplanting God's Glory would seem to be misdirected.  You are the one advocating spiritual relativism.<br>
<br>
Where's the holier-than-thou attitude?  You're just making stuff up now.  It's fun to repeat things you've heard others say without understanding the meaning or context, but you ought to give it a try sometime.  I didn't use anything proprietary in my comments to Muzaak.  I just spoke from the teaching of the Bible.  If you dispute something I've stated herein, rather than simply rant at me, perhaps you could back up your comments with Scripture.  I dare ya.  [Sure that's a pretty patent attempt to get you to read the Bible, but if you're going to claim that what I'm saying isn't &quot;Christian&quot;, then you pretty much have to turn to the source to prove me wrong.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ]<br>
<br>
As for Lukaria, myself and others, I disagree that we don't have an obligation to tell others what we believe.  Aside from the fact we've been commanded to do so by Christ, it is only fair and right that we do so.  You see, we believe that if you don't accept Christ as Lord, then there are eternal consequences based upon the sin we all commit on a daily basis.  Shoot, you've done it in this thread, and so have I.  Because of those consequences, there is a moral imperative that we tell you to consider the Good News.  I don't want you to suffer those consequences, so I let you know what I believe. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/umuzaak.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Muzaak</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_lightning.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 108<br> <font color=#E9D756>(11/2/01 10:41:18 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Get a Life yourself</span><hr size=1> Raedwulf, I have to confess that the hypocrisy you display in this thread (and on the board in general) is astounding. You cried foul play when I chastised Lukaria for posting an advertisement for his church on this board. When Misty presented his/her statements of belief you quite condescendingly told Misty she/he doesn't understand &quot;faith&quot;, (As if your idea of faith is universally true!) and proceeded to chastise Misty for expressing his view while giving yourself license to &quot;bible thump&quot;! So everbody who disagrees with Raedwulf's view of life is wrong, according to the holy than thou Raedwulf! It is so easy for you to pass judgement as you see fit, but when another points it out to you they become &quot;evil&quot; in your black and white world. I truly feel sorry for you Raedwulf. Your lack of honesty will sooner or later leave you an empty hull of a person. Sure, you can bend your knee and pray to Jesus, but your delusional world will be all you have in the end. /Rant off <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uraedwulf.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Raedwulf</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_thatch.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 411<br> <font color=#E9D756>(11/2/01 2:12:51 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Get a Life yourself</span><hr size=1> Muzaak:  Misty clearly was confusing the concepts of faith and belief.  She didn't define &quot;faith&quot;, she merely threw the word around in a manner demonstrating that she didn't know how the term was being used.  Yes I challenged her in that regard, but that's the subject this thread has turned into.<br>
<br>
Misty didn't present her statements of belief, she flamed Lukaria and I.  I critiqued those comments that made sense, and asked her to explain the many that did not.<br>
<br>
Yes, I was somewhat condescending, it's very difficult for me not to demonstrate that personality quirk, especially when dealing with issues I believe in.  I'm a somewhat scholarly sort, so it is tough not to use terms that others aren't readily familiar.  I've found that if I use my usual language, folks accuse me of having a really good thesaurus.  If I try and tone it down somewhat, I'm accused of being condescending.  It's a hard balance.<br>
<br>
Of course I was going to raise the Bible: She was claiming my position was not &quot;Christian&quot; and the Bible is the source.  Where else am I going to go?  Sports Illustrated?<br>
<br>
Nope, not everyone who disagrees with me on any topic is wrong.  I've been wrong a few times I'm sure.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   However, on matters of faith, I believe I am right.  [See above flat v. round Earth discussion.]  I'm sure you believe you are right, too.  If you don't, you're fooling yourself.<br>
<br>
I never passed judgment on anyone.  I didn't declare anyone evil.  Misty threw down a gauntlet (as well as a bunch of weird accusations), and I picked it up.<br>
<br>
Lack of honesty?  Where?<br>
<br>
As I said, it's fun to flame without identifying what you are talking about or supporting your claim.  It's also quite childish.<br>
<br>
Drive thru, please.<br>

I think you are reading into his post what you believe &quot;faith&quot; to mean. I reread Misty's post and the term &quot;faith&quot; is clearly being used generically to stand for &quot;religion&quot; in general. Not terribly hard to see if you have an open mind, Raedwulf.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, I was somewhat condescending, it's very difficult for me not to demonstrate that personality quirk, especially when dealing with issues I believe in.&quot;<br>
<br>
Oh, yes, and you are just so scholarly, giving you license to exhibit such behaviors. *boggle* Scholarship is exemplified when the words of an individual consitently pass muster. You have yet to come even close to demonstrating as much here! Needless to say, I would agree with you that a gaming board is not the forum to post scholarly works or to debate issues requiring detailed attention to such works.<br>
<br>
&quot;Of course I was going to raise the Bible: She was claiming my position was not &quot;Christian&quot; and the Bible is the source. Where else am I going to go? Sports Illustrated?&quot;<br>
<br>
You might take a break and go read SI! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  This is a gaming board. This is NOT the &quot;Fundy Convert your ass to Christianity&quot; board. If you are so concerned about &quot;faith&quot; and &quot;showing Christ&quot; to people on EMarr then clean up your act Raedwulf. I have read your vulgur flames elsewhere and I don't think your lord would approve. Do you? Oh, yes, I know, you are not perfect and can just go say a little prayer and all is good for your soul! I have no respect for Evangelical Christians at all because of people JUST LIKE YOU! *Remembers Jimmy Swagart and Rev. Baker...*<br>
<br>
&quot;However, on matters of faith, I believe I am right. [See above flat v. round Earth discussion.] I'm sure you believe you are right, too. If you don't, you're fooling yourself.&quot;<br>
<br>
I don't proclaim to have some over-arching faith that all should subscribe to or they will face damnation, as you do. That is the difference between my beliefs and yours. I need not stand silently in judgment of others as your arrogant beliefs allow you to do.<br>
<br>
&quot;Lack of honesty? Where?&quot;<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  You must like playing shell games. I bet you are real scrapper in life. You don't get it because you refuse to. Like I said earlier, people like you think they are so right.

ROFLMAO, man I KNEW you would come back to this post and reply right after I posted 'cause, like I said before;  you dwell on attacking others opinions and ideas to keep from introspecting upon your own.  You don't introspect because, the truth scares you and an uncontrollable feeling is beyond your control.  Just another ignorant fear that is cured by an arrogantly-physodic attitude.  It's sad really.  You think you are fighting against freaks, hatemongers and fanatics but you are actually only hating yourself by refusing to love yourself and find something positive.  And you won't give-in because the flood of feelings from your childhood and young-adult life control you in anger.  The hate and despise that others put you through and the lack of positive parental response that you experienced will keep you this way until you feel that you have pissed-off and hurt God with the same anger and hate that has been bestowed upon you.  You are a savy communicater.  Respond to me again.  I am sure you will check the board again very soon but you probably won't post since I pointed out the fact that I knew you would respond immediatly before.  I know you don't react to challenges.  You will keep acting as if others don't affect you;  just like you learned to do earlier in life when you were all alone.  No one was there for you.  Another adaptation to your environment.  Understandable, but staying that way, in your little shell keeps you just as arrogant and ignorant as the people you criticise.  A victim of the same shit you so strongly oppose.  Your passion is strong but you lost your bearing when you closed your heart and only used your eyes for direction.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/umuzaak.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Muzaak</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_lightning.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 114<br> <font color=#E9D756>(11/5/01 1:34:59 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: One Church's teachings on the current events:</span><hr size=1> Such insight into my life Brutas222!

<br>
I haven't even read this post since I bumped it, seriously thinking no one would visit the website and check out the teachings.  And maybe no one did.  Who knows.  I would be interested to know if Muzaak actually did visit the site and listen to all the teachings in their entirety.<br>
<br>
However, since my name has been mentioned and used in arguments here in this post, who don't I clear a few things up.<br>
<br>
First off, Muzaak, I am female.  You kept calling me a he and of course as we have never met in RL, there is no way for anyone to know that unless I say.<br>
<br>
Secondly, my intention in posting this link was to provide some teachings that were being done by a leader at my church on the bombings.  As I listened to him teach, I found a lot of what he said very interesting and thought I would share the link.  That is all.<br>
<br>
Third: In the past, I have spoken of evangelism etc. but in this post I did not at all.  It is however mentioned at the end of all of our teachings, so if that is where you heard it, then I can see where you might get the idea I was evangelizing here.  However, in this case, I actually was not purposely doing so.  Of course, if someone heard the message and accepted Christ as a result of the teaching or other items they saw on the website, more power to them!<br>
<br>
Fourth:  I am not exactly sure where you got the idea I was promoting my chuch.  If that were my sole purpose, that would be a very silly thing to do as my church may not be anywhere near anyone who even reads these boards.  Also, I am not in the habit of promoting my chuch, and did not do so on this post.  Instead, I was promoting the teaching itself.  I found the information interesting, and if you read my intital post again, you'll see that I even mention that whether people agree with it or not, it is thought provoking.<br>
<br>
Fifth:  I am not sure where Misty's remarks came from or why they were directed to me when I had not posted anything other than the original post.  <br>
<br>
Sixth:  (In general) I am not exactly sure Muzaak why you do so love to attempt to flame me, and make it seem as if everything I might say is a lie.  I have stated in other posts, that I realize you are an atheist, who does not believe what I believe.  I have politely said on several occassions, that I do respect your opinions even though I do not agree with them.  If your intent is to try to stop me &quot;converting&quot; peple as you (or someone) put it, perhaps you should realize it is NOT my intent to convert anyone.  All I ever do, in any post on this matter EXCEPT THIS POST (where I did NOT evangelize at all -YET), is to let people know there is a perfect, loving God who is Holy and righteous and that He sent his son to die for all mankind, in order to reconcile us to Him so that we may have eternal life.  I am not telling you what to think.  I am presenting another side to the story.  I always state that it is a PERSONAL CHOICE whether to accept Christ or not.  Of course I do hope people do this, and yes that includes you (Ok I feel the flame coming on from that one), because God did this for ALL of us.  But it is a choice, and you can choose to reject God.  As you have done.  That your choice.  No, it isn't mine, and I mourn your choice, because I do believe that choice does have an eternal consequence.<br>
<br>
Ok now I've done it.. darn it I evangelized in this post.  I take it back where I said I didn't cause NOW i have.  However in my original post I did not.<br>
<br>
I am sure you can see the difference.<br>
<br>
Now, to close.  <br>
<br>
I am positive some people went and looked at this site.  At least I hope they did.  And I want you to know personally Muzaak that I did not do this out of some malicious intent to take advantage of people.  A lot of people were asking where was God during this.  My chuch leader was answering that question.  Was he the only one doing so? No!  In fact some Christian went on TV (cannot remember the name but I can look it up if you want ) and said it was God's judgement for abortiona dn stuff.  Thats utter nonsense in my opinion, but a lot of people probably believe it.<br>
<br>
I simply posted the link as a place to get some answers.  Maybe people agreed, maybe not.<br>
<br>
Hint tho -  it says in the title a church's teachings on the subject so therefore, if someone did not want to hear a Christian view, I am sure they did not visit.  That would be like attending church and then complaining that all people talked about was God all morning.<br>
<br>
As for bible thumping.  Not sure where you got that idea.  I believe I have talked about God in a total of maybe 4 or 5 threads.  In my view a bible thumper is someone who goes around doo to door or maybe those preachers on the college campus who holler about how terrible we are.  <br>
<br>
Now, personally, I realize you don't like me Muzaak, simply because of my religious views.  However, if you have such a distaste for anything I write, my suggestion is not to read it.  No one is forcing you to read it, so skip over it.<br>
<br>
Btw, I thank you for your concern, but I am content with my house, family, friends, faith, in general with my life.  I believe I mentioned that ina  previous thread to you somewhere.  If by &quot;getting a life&quot; you mean a life without God, well, in my perspective, that isnt a life at all, its simply existence, and an empty one at that.<br>
<br>
I know you'll reply to this.  I know you'll flame me, call me stupid and ignorant, point out my typos, probably throw ina  few choice words, and in general pick apart anything I said and try to make it look stupid.  Thats ok.  Go ahead if it makes you happy or if you feel you are truly accomplishing something worthwhile.  However, you know you aren't goign to change my faith, so why bother?  Up to you though.  After all, I replied <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I won't dignify any /rude flames with a response, but if you have a serious question, perhaps I will.  Or email me.  <br>
<br>
Btw, Misty, if you were replying to the actual teaching itself, feel free to email me any questions you had.  I'd be happy to reply.  As I said, I am sure many people would not agree and thats ok.  If you were relying to some posts though, you mixed me up with someone else - I only posted the intital post and now this one.<br>
<br>
And Raed, thanks for trying to defend me somewhat.  I am sorry I didn't look earlier.  However, maybe between the two of you, this thread was kept alive long enough for people to actually see the link and check it out.  Funny to think that maybe God was using Muzaak all along to promote Him <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  .<br>
<br>
Anyways, good luck all.  If this falls into obscurity, np.  I was amazed it made it this long.<br>

If you actually understood the gospel and the essential truths to what being a Christian is, you would know there is no need to &quot;score points&quot; with the Lord.  <br>
<br>
We are saved by way of God's grace, feely given.  You must choose to accept that grace to be saved though.  <br>
<br>
There are no points, there is so &quot;sliding scale, there is no relativism - God's grace is not based upon works.  <br>
<br>
Until you understand that, then you don't really know what it means to be a Christian.  <br>
<br>
I suggest before you debate something, you actually get the facts straight first.  <br>

Good day.  Do yourself a favor, don't reply to me anymore.  It wastes your time and mine.<br>

I could care fucking less what it means to be a &quot;Christian&quot; because I have no desire at all to be a cock sucking shit brick. Most &quot;good&quot; Christians that I know haven't any grey matter in the skull they think god gave them. It is obvious to me, Lukaria, that you are a dumb shit also. I can't help you and neither would I try. Just in case you haven't figured it out numb nuts, I am an ATHEIST! I don't believe in your god and anything I say about your god or your religion is all in fun from my perspective. For example, when Christ cums it is only because Jimmy Swagart gave Christ the blow job he was looking for! =)<br>

Mistyglen is not a chick name, I am a he not a she... <br>
<br>
I took this name from a combination of images which were my preferred approximation of an blend of neo-Arthurian and Tolkienesque "Elvis". Hence my full name is "Mistyglen Ironbright". I desired some antiphony between "Excalibur" and a magical mystery allegorical to being in a Tolkienesque world. <br>
<br>
Allow me to digress.<br>
<br>
I see "The Pelopennesian War", by Thucydides, "The Histories", by Herodotus, Homer's "The Illiad" and "Oddyssey", the legend of King Arthur and Knights of The Round Table (authorship uncertain), the Holy Bible (as text) and the 2 great wars of the 20th century as influencing J.R.R., in works which I have read of his: "The Silmarillion", "The Lord of the Rings" and "The Hobbit". <br>
<br>
The most dramatic moment in LoTR for me is probably when Gandalf (now back from the dead) prepares to face the Ringwraith King at the City gates, in total darkness (which has engulfed the world for days) and a Cock crows...<br>
<br>
<br>
============================================================<br>
<br>
"Then the Black Captain rose in his stirrups and cried aloud in a dreadful voice, speaking in some forgotten tongue words of power and terror to rend both heart and stone.<br>
Thrice he cried. Thrice the great ram boomed. And suddenly upon the last stroke the Gate of Gondor broke. As if stricken by some blasting spell it burst asunder: there was a flash of searing lightning, and the doors tumbled in riven fragments to the ground.<br>
In rode the Lord of the Nazgul. A great black shape against the fires beyond he loomed up, grown to a vast menace of despair. In rode the Lord of the Nazgul, under the archway that no enemy ever yet had passed, and all fled before his face.<br>
All save one. There waiting, silent and still in the space before the Gate, sat Gandalf upon Shadowfax: Shadowfax who alone among the free horses of the earth endured the terror, unmoving, steadfast as a graven image in Rath Dinen.<br>
<br>
"You cannot enter here," said Gandalf, and the huge shadow halted. "Go back to the abyss prepared for you! Go back! Fall into the nothingness that awaits you and your master. Go!"<br>
The Black Rider flung back his hood, and behold! he had a kingly crown; and yet upon no head visible was it set. The red fires shone between it and the mantled shoulders vast and dark. From a mouth unseen there came a deadly laughter.<br>
"Old fool!" he said. "Old fool! this is my hour. Do you not know Death when you see it? Die now and curse in vain!" And with that he lifted high his sword and flames ran down the blade.<br>
Gandalf did not move. And in that very moment, away behind in some courtyard of the City, a cock crowed. Shrill and clear he crowed, recking nothing of wizardry or war, welcoming only the morning that in the sky far above the shadows of death was coming with the dawn."<br>
============================================================<br>
<br>
<br>
Great stuff!<br>
<br>
He (Tolkien)even says he intended to create a myth along the lines of epic narrative, in the foreword to "The Silmarillion", which btw is a beautiful work of literature and is hard to put down even the 2nd or 3rd time it is read...<br>
<br>
*From a Letter by J.R.R.Tolkien to Milton Waldman, 1951 [extract]:<br>
<br>
"But an equally basic passion of mine 'ab initio' was for myth (not allegory!) and for fairy-story, and above all for heroic legend on the brink of fairy-tale and history...<br>
<br>
But once upon a time (my crest has long since fallen) I had a mind to make a body of more or less connected legend, ranging from the large and cosmogonic, to the level of romantic fairy-story..."<br>

I never meant to add appeal to the contents inside this thread. Which I guess an excerpt from Tolkien might accomplish unintentionally. As for Lukaria, as she posted the topic I suppose it might owe more to reflex than motive, I was raised by nuns and brothers hence I am not religious. <br>
