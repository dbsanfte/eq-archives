Most are ok, but its still packed full of fucking idiots like Pidshit. I came across something yesterday that reminded me of how moronic society has become. And a lot of these rejects somehow figure out how to boot a computer up and at some point stumble across EQ.<br>
<br>
True Story from Yesterday:<br>
<br>
I'm taking a trip to Thailand on thursday and decided to pick up some reading for the lazy beach days, etc. So I head to the book store. You'd figure you'd find a smarter breed in a book store right? Well, you're dead ass wrong if you think so.<br>
<br>
I say to the clerk, &quot;Where do you keep your books by H.G. Wells?&quot;<br>
<br>
Clerk says, &quot;Oh, is that a new book?&quot;<br>
<br>
I think, &quot;You got to be fucking kidding me.&quot;<br>
<br>
I say, &quot;No... ummm... he's a classical writer. One of the books he wrote was 'The Time Machine.' You probably read it in high school.&quot;<br>
<br>
Clerk says, &quot;No, I've never heard of that.&quot;<br>
<br>
I think, &quot;OMFG.&quot;<br>
<br>
I say, &quot;Ok, where do you keep books like 'Tale of Two Cities' and 'The House of Usher' and 'Canteberry Tales' and the like?&quot;<br>
<br>
Clerk says, &quot;Are those new?&quot;<br>
<br>
/e smacks forehead.<br>
<br>
I say, &quot;Ok, how about Hamlet?&quot;<br>
<br>
Clerk says, &quot;Oh, with Mel Gibson. Yeah... they got that over at the video store I think.&quot;<br>
<br>
/sigh<br>
<br>
I say, &quot;Nevermind.&quot;<br>
<br>
Where the hell are these dorkballs educated? No fucking way an adult that works in a book store can be this fucking stupid. Ok, if you're not an American or an English dude, you might have an excuse. But this dude was an American. And you know what? This guy sure as hell isn't the only one I've seen this fucking dumb. <br>
<br>
Where the hell is society going these days? Ever seen the bullshit they teach in college these days? Or how about the idiots teaching? I'm not talking about the physics, math, english, etc professors. I'm talking about the numb nut half breeds teaching &quot;Women's Heterosexual Autonomy in Queer Society&quot; or some other fruity ass freakin subject.<br>
<br>
So, its not your fault you're fucked up. But if you read this and you're English or an American that has no clue what the books I mentioned above are.... you are officailly advised here.... you've been cheated and fucked. <br>
<br>
Qool<br>
<br>
P.S. - If you mispell a word here and there, you're normal. However, if you don't know how to use 'there' and 'their' properly.... you are fucking stupid as well.<br>

<br>
I have always had a lot of problems with my English. I was a straight &quot;A&quot; student through high school and collage all except for my English. Which I usually received D's in. In my second year of collage my geology professor noticed me writing my letters backwards during a test and told me I may be dyslexic. He then told me that he had noticed on a previous test that my E's were upside down but hadn't said anything figuring I already knew about the problem. Its sad that nothing was ever said before this. Some people just don't care. =( He was correct. A lot of people have the same problem as me including Tom Cruse, Michael Jordan, James Dean and Albert Einstein. We just don't see the words and letters the same way normal people do.<br>
<br>
I'm a firm believer that everyone is smart in there own way. If someone can write well they are no smarter then someone who can fix a car or build a computer. They are all just smart in different ways. <br>

   Everyone stay safe and Ticklish!! Including you Qool. =)<br>

<br>
It's people who vote down increases to school taxes and bitch every year when they write the check, and then bitch about the lack of education in the same people they don't want to pay to be educated.<br>
<br>
It's overcrowded schools and high student to teacher ratio.<br>
<br>
It's parents that don't teach their children the joy of reading.<br>
<br>
It's those cheater books, can't remember what they are called, that give kids the outlines of the story, but gives them no love for the story.<br>
<br>
Not too mention that the classics taught in the area you live in, may well not be the classics taught in another regional area.<br>
For instance, HG Wells, was not required reading in my high school/college.  I read it on my own.  I was required to read other classics instead.  However, love of reading was both taught to me as a child and taught to my children as they grow.<br>
<br>
However, given the nature and verbiage of your rant, I suspect you don't care about any of this, but rather that you can spout off about folks and courses you actually think below you.  Considering your bigoted racist rant towards the end of the page, I tend to think you are just as stupid as the folks you intend to flame.  Looks like someone taught you to read, but not much more.<br>

...man, you musta just been beaming with self-satisfaction as you left that store, confident in your superior intelligence.<br>
<br>
Anyhow, that aside, my interest was piqued by Ienia's references. Especially the one regarding Albert Einstein. I was unaware of his dyslexia. Undeniably the man possesed incredible intellect and insight into the world around him and it saddens me that most only are aware of his contributions in the realm of physics when in fact, he was every bit as brilliant a social scientist. This fact has been carefully omitted from our American education system and I think many would be suprised to know that the bulk of his life's work was devoted to this study and not the physical sciences. If this field is of interest to anyone, I would recommend reading his article in the innaugural issue of The Monthly Review titled 'Why Socialism' ( from the title alone it shouldn't be too hard to figure out why his 'real' work was suppressed here in America ). It is easily archived ( sorry i don't have a link for it ) and is without a doubt the most brilliant/simple treatsie on collective organization you will read. I'll keep looking for works by Tom Cruise and James Dean too =P</font><P><P><i></i></TD></TR><TR BGCOLOR=#666666><TD NOWRAP width=20% valign=top align=left><B><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2><A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/upurifyre.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Purifyre</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://fp.geocities.com/nf256/checkerball.gif BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10></FONT></B><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>Veteran</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>posts: </FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>1060</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>(</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#E9D756>3/20/01</FONT> <FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#E9D756>11:41:31 pm</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>)<BR></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT><B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">Re: Are you fucking stupid too?</font></B><HR><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">I work part-time in a library while attending classes and my biggest peeve with parents who bring their kids to get books is when the child, eager and excited to read, brings up 12 books to the parent to get checked out, and the parent then says, &quot;Ok Junior now pick 2 of those books to take home!&quot;   - I almost want to go over and tear a strip off of them - why? well after the kid is done their measly 2 books they will sit like a formless potato in front of the tv - while you may learn from tv it is not on par with reading material in any way, shape, or form.. Simply put the more you read the FASTER you read - because if you read a lot you learn to spell intuitively - I can spell words I have never seen before after hearing them because I know what the roots mean, or what their latin equivalents are and how those roots are spelled etc - I can take a new word I have never before encountered and give you a very good approximation of what it means just by breaking it down into parts - the faster you read the easier it is to learn things.   When you have a good grasp of spelling, and word etymology then you need only skim sentences to pick out the 2 or 3 important words - the rest of the words are just filler to connect the important ones -  If you have kids or plan on having kids - get them to read til their eyes bleed, it will pay off down the road for them....If you are interested in learning modern European &quot;Romance&quot; languages like French, Spanish, Italian, etc - take some latin or basic linguistic courses - If you know Latin you can go to any of these countries and read effectively enough to get around (pronounciation and speech patterns are another thing entirely hehe)  - anyways I'm done ranting for now....<br>

It's called Theory and Dynamics of Racism and Oppression.  I went in to it thinking it was going to be outrageous, but surprisingly I actually learned something about the way people treat each other.  Even in an isolated environment such as EQ, where people assume identities that are very similar, there is a lot of arguing and oppression.  Generalizing, RPers hate powergamers, powergamers hate RPers, classes hate other classes, guilds hate other guilds, female characters are harassed...people scam and deceive other people, on a daily basis.

Just when I thought you couldn't make a more idiotic, whiney, and self-serving post you come in here and raise the bar again. Good job, man! Your success rate astounds me. Too bad they don't have a jackass olympics, 'cause buddy, you'd bring home the gold!<br>
<br>
The way you describe intelligence makes me want to pray to God, Satan, and any other supreme beings listening to grant my wish and restrict you to playing with tinker toys, taking up full residence at KinderKare, and barring you from any type of meaningful position of power in normal society. Take my firstborn, please!<br>
<br>
Using your measuring stick I'm sure many of the great leaders and thinkers of our time would have been overlooked. I wonder if Stephen Hawkins, Federico Garcia Lorca, or Charles Bukowski ever read H.G. Wells or any of those other books you deem necessary to achieve that certain level of 'Qool Evolution.' Guess what? I don't give a fuck if they were raised on Benny Hill and All in the Family reruns, asshole! I consider all of those men brilliant, but I guarantee none of them fit your standards. Wake up man.. and ask yourself: Why does Rara have to include that three line request in all of his replies to my threads?<br>
<br>
It's good to have a villiage idiot, if for nothing more than to point at and say, 'Look mamma, I'm scared' or even 'Thank god my mind doesn't operate the same way *his* does.'<br>

The problem described is that the person working in the bookstore did not know who those very famous authors were.  This is similar to being upset because you go into to the local Ford dealership and the salesman doesn't know what a &quot;Focus&quot; or an &quot;Explorer&quot; is.  Not everyone needs to be able to recite Shakespeare or list all the works of George Bernard Shaw, but you damn well should know something about your job!!!<br>
<br>
How many times do we see rants in here about the E-bayed Chanter who doesn't know what Mez is?  Same thing here, you go into an establishment with the assumption of a certain level of knowledge in the staff.  When you can't find the book you want, or your group gets FUBAR you get frustrated.<br>

If the management thought he should know the basics of American lit, they wouldn't have hired him.  They would have hired Qool.

Now, Regarding qool...<br>
<br>
He brings up a great point, but just uses harsh language and gets flamed.<br>
<br>
You should know about books to sell them.  If you are going to sell ANYTHING you should know about it... remember that thing they called customer service?  <br>
<br>
And I am happy we have people like Qool, my brother, my cousin and countless others who would be willing to risk their life to keep our country free...  Although their new comercials suck..<br>

<br>
how about comparing the person selling litterature to the one selling medical services (the desk clerk or what their name is in the US) ?<br>
<br>
they might or might possess a little medical knowledge, but they're mainly just the secretary taking appointments and selling the service the doctor provides - much as how the booksalesman sells the books - go take classes from a professor if you want deep insight in the works of H.G. Wells<br>
<br>
Would you want someone working at blockbuster to know every classic movie made too ? <br>
<br>
He was employed there to sell books, not because he knew a ton about books and should be able to tell customers about various old &quot;classic&quot; titles. <br>
<br>
<br>
And if you are so incredibly smart howcome you couldn't figure out where to find the book yourself ? <br>
