<br>
Celdor, just because you've reached a certain age doesn't mean that you've grown up.  From what I've been reading, you still have a long way to go.  Your boy and his group made the first mistake and, in my opinion, deserved what they got.  Popplo &quot;unevened&quot; the score by training the other group.<br>
<br>
You know, how can anyone be surprised when uber guilds get flamed?  In this thread, you've seen an officer act like a 2-year-old, a guildleader that refused to take responsibility for his officer's actions and more than one guildmember saying that no one's opinion matters (in one case it was &quot;no one gives a flying @#%$ what you think&quot;).  Now, I am not one to hold an entire guild responsible for the actions of a few, but are you really surprised if someone flames your guild when they only see your bad side?  Sure, a couple of your members have been on here that haven't add fuel to the flame, but they are the <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> much</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> less vocal.<br>
<br>
I've never had any problems with MF, and I don't think it's a guild full of assholes now, but, when most of what we read in this thread are guildmembers condoning Popplo's actions, then you really shouldn't act surprised when people blast your guild. <p>Carathos Ollathir<br>

Let's see, I took the time to explain <i>my</i> position and provide definitions and the best you can come up with is I don't know how to have a proper argument? And, you cry like a baby that I don't answer your posts point by point.<br>
<br>
Carathos, I hate to pop your mental image of yourself, but what you have been writing is not novel or close to it. I agree that it is a waste of time exchanging ideas with you, since you seem to have this inflated idea that <i>your</i> arguments and views are worth something more than anyone else's.<br>
<br>
<i>"Why? Does this mean that the only time I should "do the right thing" is when it benefits me? To continue using my frenzied example, group two gets no reward for leaving group one in peace."</i><br>
<br>
You were actually starting to get some meat on the proverbial bone then you resorted to whinning how you aren't being paid what you feel is due attention to your examples. So let me point out two things and see what you think. Using the above quote as an example.<br>
<br>
I don't need to consider your example of the frenzied, because you haven't proven that IG actions are moral actions. You are engaged in much question begging and up to now I have avoided pointing out as much. If you want your argument to work you will have to demonstrate (not through question begging examples) that IG actions can be moral.<br>
<br>
Finally, the only time anybody does the "right thing" is when there are percieved benefits for doing said action. <p>Lurikeen Mali'Kyre<BR>

All I have been doing is repeating myself in the last few posts because you apparently keep missing the point.  I said that IG actions do NOT equal moral actions.  I said that some IG actions are the RESULT of moral decisions.  I stated this a few posts ago and you have yet to refute it.  One cannot possibly perpetuate a one-sided argument.<br>
<br>
If you feel that I am &quot;question begging&quot; because I don't know what I'm talking about, that's your problem.  I ask questions because I want answers.  Answers that are you apparently unwilling to give.  If you want to call it question begging so you can continue to dodge them, it is your prerogative, but there is no need to resort to demeaning my style of argument if you can't keep up.  That is your fault, not mine.<br>
<br>
I don't believe my opinions are worth more than anyone else's, but I do believe they deserve as much a response as yours.  You are the &quot;egotistical overbearing bastard&quot; here, not I.  Remember?<br>

<br>
I Agree with you there.<br>
<br>
<i>"If you feel that I am "question begging" because I don't know what I'm talking about, that's your problem. I ask questions because I want answers. Answers that are you apparently unwilling to give."</i><br>
<br>
Look, I may be an overbearing egotistical bastard, but I am a fair one. :) Question begging doesn't mean you don't know what you are talking about. It just indicated you are making a simple mistake in argument form. As far as providing answers, or the willingness to do so... I think we are just talking past each other. Again, no blame is necessary here.<br>
<br>
<i>"...there is no need to resort to demeaning my style of argument if you can't keep up."</i><br>
<br>
Pointing out errors in someone's logic is not meant to be demeaning. I didn't say you were a retard, or that your arguments sucked or that you are stupid. I make no apologies for saying that your arguments involve question begging.<br>
<br>
For the record I do respect your view. I think you started out putting the wrong foot forward with me, and you feel the same about me.<br>

<br>
<i>"I know lots of people including myself who do the "right thing" in game and out merely because it's the right thing to do, not for some benefit perceived or otherwise."</i><br>
<br>
Trech's question hit the nail on the head. Is there such a thing as "altruism"?<br>
<br>
I firmly believe that there are varying types of "Good" and "Bad". An apple that is "good" is not a morally good Apple. :) Getting burned by a fire is "bad" but not morally bad. However, we behave differently based upon what we percieve as "bad" or "good"; moral or not.<br>
<br>
In my view, there is a such thing as altruism, but what counts as "selfish behavior" is a matter of degree. All moral behavior is selfish at some level. In other words, we percieve some benefit to acting in such and such way.<br>
<br>
So, Nire, if you want to come back with a "You must be a sad person living in a sad world" line, that is fine by me. I really care less. :) <p>Lurikeen Mali'Kyre<BR>

<br>
I fully agree with you, I don't care who they are, if they fu<!>ck up they are going to hear about it. No I am not going to persecute them for it, and they will be given the benefit of the doubt due to my respect of them.<br>
<br>
My friends don't do things that are totally as<!>sholeish, so when they do step out of line (in my opinion) I tell them, and they extend the same courtesy to me. <br>
