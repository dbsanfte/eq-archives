I'll admit that I skim them, but as soon as I see a reference to Da`kor or any member of their guild...I hit the scroll on my mouse very fucking fast.<br>
<br>
You talk about not having a grudge against Da`kor anymore, guess it's just evolved to every player of the guild...not the guild itself.  Lord knows I've had my problems with their guild, alot of us in MS have had to constantly butt heads with them at one time or another.  Just give it a break, none of us care..and 99% of us would love to see your ass banned from this board.  I think more people would cheer at your departure than we did when Ewle got busted out.<br>
<br>
Maybe you just enjoy the attention, I don't know and I don't really care.  I just wonder how many people telling you that you have serious mental problems, and that you should seek professional help or just end it all with a 45 to your head before you'll listen.<br>
<br>
Anyway, as far as DAoC's lifespan.  Who knows.  From what I saw during beta 4 it was a fairly promising game...I played a few classes past level 5 to get the feel for the specialization(I must say the hide/sneak graphics on the character look damn good) and my favorites were definitely shadowblade, eldritch, and wizard.  I spread my points around instead of picking one field to dump the majority into...made the game sorta interesting since I've always found it easier to level on my own than group. <br>
<br>
Alot of the combat system things I liked.  Like how you can't really kite.  Some classes get snare/root spells..but they have a duration plus once the mob is hit by any damaging spell it automatically breaks.  You can attempt to kite(ala-root kiting methods from EQ), but you have to be facing the mob to recast on it, plus it will eventually give up chasing you if you do it for too long.<br>
<br>
Also, mobs forget.  Like that goblin fisherman that I had to use sprint to get away from won't come rushing back after me once I get so close, regardless of whether it could feasibly see me or not.  It just goes back to its spawn point, like it figures it deterred me from trying to kill it and is now going to go back about its business....that is until I attack it again <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Which in doing so, I seemed to notice that 80-90% of the time they remove a chunk of the xp you would've gotten had you just killed it straight up.  I can only assume this is because you can sit to regain your mana/hp really fast, while the mob just goes back to standing where it was before you attacked it...giving you a definite advantage.<br>
<br>
I like the different spell effects per realm.  Like certain spells might do the same basic thing as another spell owned by another class in another realm, but they would look almost totally different.  Plus how some high-level spells have graphics that are, simply put, Huge.  I remember running my avalonian sorcerer from his starting place at that academy(don't remember the name off-hand, begins with an L I believe) to camelot hills.  The run reminded me alot of trying to go from Qeynos to Freeport on foot at low levels.  (the forest I started in had shitty mob-levels..went from abundant level 1 mobs..to sparse level 3 mobs...and then jumped straight to level 7+ mobs)<br>
<br>
Along the way, after crossing the bridge a small ways before the keep, I noticed bright flashes of light that filled the small valleys of the path I was on and all the area around me.  I, being a DAoC newbie, was like &quot;Oh shit what was that?&quot;. And the theurgist I was travelling with simply told me it was the graphics from a high level spell caster nearby.<br>
<br>
That kind of shit impressed me, the awe of something so simple as a spell being cast by someone much higher level than me.  In EQ you can only marvel when you ask how much damage suchandsuch did, as all spells of the same type(regardless of level/race/class) look basically the same.  Only with a few added effects for levels..(like more glowing balls when you cast invis...or the added colors to shielding spells)<br>
<br>
Will I buy DAoC? Maybe...EQ is still alot of fun for me, which is probably garnered from the fact that I do belong to the powerful guild that I do.  I also believe that DAoC will show VI at least a little of what they should've done, and will 'force their hand' into making certain changes to keep up with the competition.(seperate chat windows for combat/etc come to mind as some of the basics)<br>
<br>
I've never wanted a pet...I've always wanted a familiar, however(along the lines of D&amp;D type fams)...so I'm quite interested in how fucked up VI will do them, or maybe that they might even get them mostly right.  If they let us name them(since they aren't exactly a pet afterall and you'll basically be summoning the same one each time) it will be an even bigger boon.  I'm going to enjoy having my drake tag along behind me. <p><center><img src=" http://home.btconnect.com/Lindzc/mage.gif"><i><b><font size="3" face="Ariel Narrow"><font color="red"><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=8859>Ramierez D`Elerian Draegonis</a></i></b></font></font><img src=" http://home.btconnect.com/Lindzc/mage.gif"><i><b><font size="2" face="Ariel Narrow"><font color="blue"><br>A Wizard's soul is forged in the crucible of magic.~~Antimodes of the White Robes.</i></b></font></font></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uramierez.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ramierez</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 226<br> <font color=#E9D756>(10/26/01 11:38:17 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=7.topic&index=110>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Attention Viewers!</span><hr size=1> Oh...and as far as hawaii...I don't think he could pass the ASVAB, let alone belong to any armed forces with something like that.

<br>
Hawaii, if you do belong to one of the armed forces, and it just happens to be the Army, and you really care about that disorder enough to prove it....I'm a 75B10...I can pull up your 201 file pretty easily.  Honestly, I don't see how they'd let you do anything but infantry if it was that pronounced and even that would be iffy...You call in fire support, but when you give your position, you invert the grid coordinates or even the map ID(in the military, the world maps are seperated into a specified size/number of grids.  Each map is given its own alpha-numeric identifier, but all use the same alpha-numerics for the grids themselves.)<br>

(My original character used to group with Celdor in South Karana, back in the days when killing an avocet was a bigger rush than a plane raid, for crying out loud.) It's not a secret or anything.

Welcome to generation two, where the people who work on MMOGs have played the others. I honestly recognize most of the in-game names in this thread. I remember dropping twink loot on some of you. I trained some of you a few times, (although it wasn't on purpose and I was lost, I swear, that's my story and I'm sticking to it). I got into arguments with some of you. Some of you organized pick up plane raids that I was on. I came and pulled fire giants for some of you.<br>
<br>
My point is that knowing me isn't weird. Most of you do, even if you don't realize it. &quot;Developers&quot; are not gods, they are normal players with really cool jobs. <br>
