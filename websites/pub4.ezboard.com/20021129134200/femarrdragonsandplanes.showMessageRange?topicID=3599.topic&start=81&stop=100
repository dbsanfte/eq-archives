The point is that I don't... but I will be allowing my kids the freedom to chose what they believe.  I'll bring them up to respect others, and to search for what they feel is the truth... be that the bible, the teachings of Bhudda, or the Koran is immaterial to me.<br>

<br>
If you really feel that it is your province to judge others, shouldn't you do so based on YOUR relationship with them?  Not what they do with consenting others, what understanding they have with their spouse, how much they pay in taxes, whether they have a good job or a minimum wage job, etc?<br>
<br>
Keep on arguing -- maybe next week I can start an equally productive discussion about how many angels can dance on the head of a pin.<br>

Yes I named Christians by name but then hasn't everyone else in this thread concerning this issue? Everyone else can voice their opinion in the name of Christianity yet I can't merely use the word or referal without it being seen as me saying &quot;religion is evil&quot;? It's a FACT that organized religions of any sort have opressed and forced their views on others throughout time. They <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> STILL DO</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->. If that's not evident to you then your going through life with your eyes closed. Sept 11th happened because Osama and his ilk see the US as an evil entity in the world that must be destroyed at all costs, even their own lives. A good part of that(if not all of it!) is driven by their religious beliefs. That wasn't in the dark ages. That wasn't their ancestors. That was almost a year ago in <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> 8 days</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> time and its still pretty fresh in <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> my</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> mind when I decided to flip through the channels after reading some posts to THESE boards to see the first of the twin towers in rubble and the second in flames only minutes from coming down itself. Dark ages my arse. <br>
<br>
Yes Knobb, it's a sad thing that it takes so long, and as I pointed out it's the continuation of these sort of mindsets that keep these things in the world, but just be glad that it WILL happen. It may take a few more centuries but we'll get there. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uwenjii.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Wenjii</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 107<br> <font color=#E9D756>(9/3/02 4:01:29 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3599.topic&index=85>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I'm going to assume you're refering to me</span><hr size=1> Quote:<br>

 I tell you what I do find slightly worrying, and maybe somebody else might agree with me on this one, but almost every woman who has replied to this thread has stated they are bi-sexual.<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Quote:<br>
<br>
I'm not exactly sure what about this worried you, Kerryn, but I'm personally a little concerned that many/most of the vocal females on emarr are either bisexual or...well... not female. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
In case anyone is wondering:<br>
<br>
Very Heterosexual, Very Female, and Very Married here.<br>
<br>
I agree, there are different levels of emotional and physical commitment. There's nothing wrong with casual sex. It's fun, but it has its time and its place. I simply decided that when I had found the man I chose to spend the rest of my life with, I found it more rewarding and passionate to be with him only.<br>
<br>
I am not making a value judgement on those who choose to have open marriages. I just don't think I would be able to find as passionate a relationship if our bedroom had a revolving cast.<br>
<br>
I am also very happy that we have chosen not to burden our children with a confusing family life. Kids can be mean. Why would I want to saddle them with a reason to be teased just for my own sexual vanity? <br>
<br>
And to add- My reasons for choosing a monogamous marriage have nothing to do with Christian morality. I just feel like I'd be cheating myself if I settled for less.<br>

<br>
First, on the subject of attempting to impose your (general term, not specific) morals and/or ideas of what a marriage is, what a marriage should encompass and what a marriage should or should not do...What gives you the right?  <br>
<br>
Each person that has responded on this thread was raised in a different manner.  While some may be very similar, none are exactly the same.  After each of these people left home and struck out against the world on your own - you began to formulate your own opinions about life, the world around you and your beliefs/ideals/morals.  While majority of you may not have changed much after you &quot;left the nest&quot;, many did. Ideas were formed, thought about and put into place.  Given this information, short of pedophilia, necrophilia, beastiality &amp; cheating (which *I* define as having sexual relations without your signifigant other's knowledge) - your (general term, not specific) sex life has absolutely no effect on me.  <br>
<br>
Therefore, I respect your (general term, not specific) opinions on how you view marriage, morality and personal beliefs.  You know why?  Because that means you have the capability of forming your own opinions about how you will run your life.  Key word here is &quot;your&quot;.  Perhaps by explaining your reasonings behind your opinions, a couple minds may change from reading this thread....perhaps not.<br>
<br>
Ideas &amp; beliefs are funny creatures.  Once they have been formulated and set - they are not likely to change.<br>
<br>
&quot;Cheating on one's spouse is against the law&quot;...<br>
Two adults that openly consent to either an open marriage, semi-open marriage or selectively open (which I define as allowing a third party to enter sexual relations with the two that are married)...have absolutely *no* grounds legally.  For each case (IE: Court documents etc) that can be brought up against this lifestyle, another can be brought up for this lifestyle.  Our legal system boils down to who has the most money and/or the better lawyer.  Legal grounds don't factor into things as trivial as sexual orientation.<br>
<br>
And for those that are curious, because it has been brought up...After I left my parent's home - I went out into the world and began what most teenagers do - *experiment*.  During said experimentation, I came into my own set of beliefs that I still go by today.  Do all of my beliefs fall in line with what the Catholic Church preachs? Absolutely not, that should be evident with the fact that I am an openly bi-sexual female which means I have, at one point in time, had sex with a female and would consider doing such again.  Last time I checked, the Catholic Church frowns severely upon homosexual activity of any sort.  I acknowledge this and when I die - I will accept the consequences of my actions.  That is not for any of you to decide for me.<br>
<br>
Elnots:<br>
<!--EZCODE HTML START--> <font color="yellow">Do you have sex with other people than Crombattleaxe? If so then I have to wonder why you two got married.</font><!--EZCODE HTML END--><br>
Would me (or him for that matter) having sex with someone really change your opinion about me?  Does that possible fact make a difference to you personally?  Does that possible fact alter your perceptions that greatly?  If it does, then we are in the same boat actually.  I read your post and got so pissed off that you were attacking those that choose a different sexual orientation - that I was willing to write you off for good.  There are just some things in this world I can't stand...And from those things, I separate myself from.  So, in all fairness, if you were to do the same with me - I would respect that and oddly - understand your reasonings to a point.  You should stand up for what you believe in, but I also believe you should take a step back and separate yourself from which you do not like.  Can't change the world.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE HTML START--> <font color="yellow">Was it, we just wanted the title of husband and wife? Was it, we wanted to cut down on our taxes? Was it, we wanted to just do something different than the norm of society?</font><!--EZCODE HTML END--><br>
Since you have such an aversion to adults making choices, I could ask similar questions of you.  Are you that sexually insecure you are not willing to explore new possibilities?  Are you that brainwashed by a 2000 year old religon that you are incapable of thinking for yourself and making your own decisions?  Are you that insecure in your relationships that you could not trust your partner?  Are you that insecure you couldn't trust yourself?<br>
To be honest, those questions you asked hurt me.  I love my husband and for those that know the two of us - you can tell we are the perfect match for each other.  We met and you could hear the &quot;click&quot;.  My husband is my soulmate and I wouldn't trade him in for anyone.  But our sex life is nobodys business.  If we choose to make our basement into an S&amp;M dungeon and invite other couples to come over and play...those choices will not directly affect you.  Therefore, you can choose to separate yourself from the situation or you can choose to remain in the situation, yet not bring the topic up.  Again, you can't change the world.<br>

To everyone that has posted an opinion in this forum : Thank you for not being robots.  Each person is different in so many ways, that is what makes us humans - free will.  And with that free will, not everyone will act as you think they should act or do as you think they should act... Remember that someday, someone will have a major issue with something you say &amp; or do.  What goes around - comes around.  Treat those as you wish to be treated. <p><center>

I too would want them to make their own decision.  Let me put this another way not including religion so you can understand.  If your child has a right to choose what he wants and grows up to be an abuse alcoholic child molester are you happy with their choice?<br>

I am not trying to be patronizing. I am just angry that people don't think through their posts. They are so intent on protecting their rights that they just assume they are being threatened.<br>

Read it again. It doesn't matter how it is with you on this point. I am saying that I would be broken hearted. Why? Because I believe in hell, because hell will be miserable, because when you love someone you don't want them to be miserable.<br>
<br>
Are you saying that if they choose not to be Christian then their beliefs negate mine? That I should view them as saved because they think they are? So I should give up my beliefs and go by theirs?<br>
<br>
Is this really that unclear?? I mean, what do you think I am saying?<br>

I hear cookies are a great way to get kids to believe in God and go to church Cendan, you might want to try that too if you ever have kids.

You are missing a hell of alot of things in your universal code there Ghie.<br>
<br>
A main one would be that you said you should not physically harm another.<br>
<br>
What about mental pain? Emotional pain?<br>
<br>
Is it alright to go up to my wife, call hre an immature slut, tell her she's worthless? I'm sure you'd agree that that's just one thing wrong there.<br>
<br>
And stealing encompass' many smaller things, many different ideas of stealing. I think the government is stealing my money with taxes, so are they evil? It's all in how you look at it. But with your very very generalized code which only emcompass' so many different possibilites then of course every major religion will more than likely have those ethics imprinted upon them.<br>
<br>
And in response to Siilv's statement, I once met a gay pastor of a gay church. Those of you that thinks that's cool of them to do so, please tell me now. So I can shoot you down with scriptures taken directly out of the bible that denounce homosexuality. Making their church a blasphemous fraud.<br>
<br>
But hell if they want to pretend to be Christians, heh heh.<br>
<br>
Sounds like Siilv pretending to be Catholic.<br>
<br>
Muahahaha!<br>
<br>
Had a friend who was a Christian and started sleeping with a married man, she still considers herself a God fearing Christian, but says, oh well. Whatever happens happens. <br>
<br>
Talk about blasphemy..<br>
<br>
Christians who directly disobey the will of God are not Christians, just like an American who blows up a Federal Building is considered to be a traitor. <br>
<br>
And lastly, if someone's an alcoholic, that doesn't mean they are hurting others. <p><img src="http://moongaden.homestead.com/files/elnots.jpg

OH MY GOD! You are so unbelievably WRONG it's not even funny. I go to an all male catholic school, ingeniously named Catholic High School. I've taken Religion classes my whole life. Not once in the Bible do the denounce homosexuality.<br>

Yes, if you completely TWIST what the Bible was saying. If you completely MISS the moral of the stories, then YES, you could concoct some ludicrous idea saying that the Bible states homosexuality is wrong - is the Devil's work!<br>

If you are none of these you can be sure that it will kill you too but there will be no special hurry.</i> - Ernest Hemingway</p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showMessageRange?topicID=3599.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showMessageRange?topicID=3599.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showMessageRange?topicID=3599.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showMessageRange?topicID=3599.topic&start=61&stop=80>4</a> <b>5</b> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showMessageRange?topicID=3599.topic&start=101&stop=120>6</a><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showMessageRange?topicID=3599.topic&start=121&stop=140>7</a><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showMessageRange?topicID=3599.topic&start=141&stop=160>8</a><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showMessageRange?topicID=3599.topic&start=161&stop=180>9</a><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showMessageRange?topicID=3599.topic&start=181&stop=200>10</a><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showMessageRange?topicID=3599.topic&start=201&stop=220>11</a><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showMessageRange?topicID=3599.topic&start=221&stop=222>12</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showPrevMessage?topicID=3599.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showNextMessage?topicID=3599.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3599.topic&index=100><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/gfx/addReply1.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.emailToFriend?topicID=3599.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.threadControl?topicID=3599.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/deleteThreadFire.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=3599.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=3599.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub4.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="emarrmessageboardrules">Message Board Rules<option value="emarrlinks">Links<option value="emarrupcomingmmorpgs">Upcoming MMOG's<option value="emarrfrm18">America Under Attack<option value="emarrfrm19">Dark Age of Camelot<option value="emarrgeneral">General<option value="emarrfrm17">Funny Stuff<option value="emarrbazaar">Item Bazaar<option value="emarrscrollsnspells">Spell Bazaar<option value="emarrfrm15">Shiny Things<option value="emarrfrm14">Bargain Basement<option value="emarrfrm20">Crafter's Hideout<option value="emarrdragonsandplanes">Rants and Flames<option value="emarrfrm13">Dragons and Planes<option value="emarrroleplaying">Roleplaying<option value="emarrroleplayingoocforum">Roleplaying - OOC Forum<option value="emarrscammeralert">Scammer Alert<option value="emarrsignaturecorner">Test Forum<option value="emarrreallife">Real Life<option value="emarrothermmorpgs">Other MMOG's</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#E9D756>- </font><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/bemarr>Erollisi Marr, The Queen of Love</a><font color=#E9D756> - </font><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes>Rants and Flames</a> <font color=#E9D756> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM GAMES AD SCRIPT -->
