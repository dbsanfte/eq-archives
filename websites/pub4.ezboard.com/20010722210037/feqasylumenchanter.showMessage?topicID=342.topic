The only time I might fire one off is if we were trying to camp a cleric out in Hate, or trying to evac from Fear.  AOE mez just has too much potential to go bad and get you killed.<br>
<br>
A lot of raids like to give certain jobs to enchanters, like: enchanter 1 gives clarity, enchanter 2 tashes, enchanter 3 mezzes, etc.  I personally don't like this and think it's much more effective to make each enchanter try to mez a mob at camp.  Most of the time, the enchanters end up working off eachother.  For example, I try to mez one creature, it resists, so I tash it, get beat on, and another enchanter mezzes it at that time  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   It's not really down to a science, but most of the time, enchanters work together and pull off some great moves that way.<br>
<br>
As for buffing and whatnot, give clarity/speed to your group, and then make the rest of em send you a damn tell instead of harassing the zone for clarity  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I'm mean about this, if I don't get a tell requesting stuff, they don't get it.<br>

  The buffs are fairly obvious, Im just wondering how you manage to control sooooo many mobs and not die each pull.<br>

<br>
That is to say:  Enchanters like things under control (of course, it being our job)  but in the planes, the rules are different.  It's harder to get all the people on the raid to understand your play style, you're bound to get at least one mez-break and you are NOT the only enchanter on the raid, so be prepared to give up a little of the "control" aspect you normally have.<br>
Don't expect much at lower levels.<br>
I didn't hit my first plane raid till 49.<br>
Even then, when I first got up there, I felt kinda useless.  All these 50+ enchanters were running around mezzing stuff and keeping things nice and neat, and I try to pop one off and get resisted and beaten on.  Typically, the lowest level enchanter doesn't do much - don't feel bad or useless if you see mez messages popping off from the other enchanters left and right while you keep geting resisted or your mez gets overidden or something like that.<br>
You'll get there, and you'll learn the most by watching them in action (as is always the case - I *love* to watch higher level enchanters in action - it gives me the opportunity to learn a lot - especially in a raid environment, where tactics change quite often depending on location and the mix classes/levels amongst the raiders).<br>
<br>
What Di said:  You can't be expected to catch every ooc/say for clarity or haste, and it's friggin annoying to see Bozo_Thacasta /ooc'ing "can i PLZ get crack?" or Mel_Eeinguy /poke'ing you and saying "need haste please" whiile you're running around CCing.  Ask them to send all requests for buffs via tell, which will makes things a bit easier on you.<br>
<br>
Stuns used to be okay.  Now they're a nono.  AE stuns can cause aggro problems with the second floor.  I demem Shift, but keep flux up.  Why?  Flux has a very small radius, and I've yet to see it cause a problem. I only use it if it is asolutely necessary, however.<br>
<br>
Do yourself a favor - grab some stacks of jasper and keep Rune3 up.  If you've got plenty of mana, stack up a berserker spirit on there too - put these spells up between every battle.  They save the cleric some mana, and give you the extra time to pop off a tash and another mez should you get resisted.  I dunno - that's just how I do it.  I'm sure I'm one of few enchanters who keeps R3 up all the time (even in exp groups - I rarely go into battle without it).  It's only a jasper, they're not that expensive, and you'll probably get reimbursed by the split alone.<br>
<br>
Mob guide:<br>
Here's a quick guide to the standard Hate mobs and my opionions on them - other folks - feel free to add any I miss and add your thoughts on them<br>
<br>
*Theft of Thought:  Level 51 spell which allows you to suck mana from an enemy for your own use.<br>
<br>
Spite Golems  (Drops shaman stuff, sometimes a dr00d shield, I think)<br>
ToT*:  Resists<br>
Unmezzable and Magic Resistant.<br>
Don't even try.  Don't mez, don't tash.  Tashing causes a lot of aggro that seriously pissed the golem off, attempting a mez is useless.  Usually, raids are quite capable of having a melee or group of melees keep one golem busy while the rest of the raid beats on the other.  Don't worry about'm.<br>
<br>
Cleric of Innoruuk  (Cleric stuff)<br>
ToT:  Yes<br>
Annoying to mez.  =P  Especially at "lower" planes levels (47-49).  If you get resisted, tash the bum and try to stun/channel through another mez.  Should go through.  They're tough, but not as tough as people made them seem when *I* first hit the planes.  Some folks I spoke to made it seem like the damn things were the hardest things in the world to mez.  They're not.  Just annoying.<br>
<br>
Scorn Banshee  (Drops bard armor)<br>
ToT:  Yes<br>
Annoying to mez.  Lately, at least =P  I dunno, I don't remember ever having a problem with them before, but last Hate raid I was on I simply couldn't mez the beasties without tashing first.  Quite disheartening.  /shrug<br>
<br>
Ire Ghast  (Uh..  these drop um..  some sort of mace, I think.. sometimes..  anything else?  /ponder)<br>
ToT:  Yes<br>
Easy targets.  /shrug  Not much more to say.<br>
<br>
Revultant Rat  (Drops a ranger whip)<br>
ToT:  No<br>
Also easy targets.  Hell, easiest regular mobs in Hate, not counting the trap-spawned "Evil Little Imps"<br>
<br>
Kirakui [or something like that]  (Warrior stuff)<br>
ToT:  No<br>
Moderately easy to mez.  You'll get a resist every once in a while, but otherwise, not too bad.<br>
<br>
Our very own...<br>
(Okay, mages too)<br>
Forsaken Revanent  (Enchanter [f] and Magician [m] stuff)<br>
ToT:  Yes<br>
@#$%'n %&*n revs!<br>
ARGH!  Biggest pain in the ass to mez.<br>
Highly magic resistant, very annoying.<br>
<br>
Abhorrent  (Rogue stuff)<br>
ToT:  No<br>
Eh..  I'd put them on par with Kiras.  Not too easy, not too hard.  Moderate.<br>
<br>
Loathing Lich  (Zip.  Nothing)<br>
ToT:  Yes<br>
I'd put them on par with ghasts.  /nod  Pretty easy to mez.<br>
<br>
Ashenbone Drake  (SK epic piece, some shields)<br>
Tot:  Yes BUT you have to be withing melee distance<br>
For these suckers, you can tash from far away, but for some reason, you must be withing melee range for any spells to not be resisted.  Nukes, ToT and especially mez can only be cast from next to the sucker.  As far as mez difficulty, they're really not too tough at all.<br>
<br>
Any of the Large, Named "Mini-Boss" Mobs<br>
ToT:  Resists<br>
These things are all nicely MR, and you really can't do much to them.  Sit back and med.  Heh.  Usually, towards the mob being at half hp, I tash for the hell of it.  Doing this before that point usually ends in the boss beating you around a bit.  For some reason MR mobs don't like being tashed one bit.<br>
<br>
Maestro of Rancor<br>
ToT:  Resists<br>
Just follow orders on this battle.  Usually what you'll do is rune the tanks, dispell the guy, and tash his arse at a certain point - however, just listen to your raid leader.<br>
<br>
Any of the Second Floor Baddies<br>
ToT:  Most of the time, yes.<br>
(Some of them have resisted me)<br>
These suckers hurt like bloody hell, HATE being tashed (I've been summoned after doing absolutely nothing until the mob was a *half life*, then tashing), and are a PAIN to mez.  I personally don't remember ever being sucessful in mezzing one, but I'd bet it's possible once they're not longer yellow, even, and red to you.  =P  Guess I'll have to wait for like, 58, to find out.. heh  Basically, on the second floor, I stand around and look pretty, popping off the occassional buff, rune, and ToT.  I'll also jump in to try to help a higher level enchanter if he/she gets in to trouble trying to control them by pulling aggro from the other enchanter and taking a bit of a beatdown.<br>
<br>
I think I got most everything.  Once again:  others, feel free to add anything I missed or you feel different about.<br>
<br>
<br>
Good luck in Hate =)  I've only raided Hate and Fear, and Hate is, as far as I'm concerned, a far more interesting and fun plane.  =D<br>

<br>
I keep AE mez up in Fear though, but I wouldn't recommend it until you're about 54+. The reason I do this is incase we get multiple TT pulls and their AE dispel effect. The only way to get a train that has these mobs in it is with an AE.<br>
<br>
Other than that, just stay loose because most raids run long and realistically you're no where near as important as a smaller group. Fact is, most hate raids these days probably would be fine without anybody on crowd control. Reason being that the monks are pretty good at pulling it now and usually the raid level is so high that they can kill just about anything that comes with ease. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uulaian.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ulaian</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I live here.... get out.</span><br> <font color=#000033>(5/28/01 10:40:27 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Some info...</span><hr size=1> Oh yeah, I agree with Daeon on 2nd floor hate... extremely resistant mobs. With all mobs tashed, I can land approximatly 1 in 5 snares at 56... and trust me, thats bad. Snare is one of those spells that is almost never resisted except by god/dragon mobs. Forsaken reventants seem to fluctuate a lot in magic resistance between the individual mobs, sometimes I land snare 1st try, sometimes I can't land it after 10 tries. I don't know if its a difference between male/female reventants or what, but all of them considered about 30% are very easy to land on, and others will flat out resist most of the time. And listen to all the other people saying AE = bad in hate, thats the utter truth. No more on hate as others have covered it very well already.<br>
<br>
Fear is somewhat different, here you can use AE stuns to buy time and for big pulls use AE mez (if you're high enough). There is no risk of causing weird agro in fear from AE spells. I have -once- seen AE mez used to great effect in a raid that was too bored to bother splitting the temple, and thus just made a DA pull of the whole thing... there were 3 enchanters 56+ though, probably not something to try with lower levels. Most mobs in fear seem to have a fairly low magic resistance, but there are a few exceptions. Amygdalan knights and warriors are fairly resistant, though it isn't too bad. Same goes for Phoboplasms. None of these are a problem after tash, though. Some glare lords can be incredibly tough however, some of them being enchanter mobs (they can be mages as well) I assume they've buffed themselves up with magic resistance. There are a few instances where I have simply not been able to snare them, even after they were tashed. It is rare, but you will encounter one of the super resistant ones eventually. These, along with Tentacle Tormentors, are also capable of AE dispelling, so they are the first mobs you want to mez if they are part of a pull, and should always be the last to be killed. Usally these mobs are fear kited to prevent dispelling (if the raid is capable of following directions that is, been on a few that weren't). <p>Ulaian Moonleaf <BR>

Ill chime in here too.<br>
<br>
Usually, the highest level enchanter goes into the &quot;pull group&quot; on a raid.  The pull group is the group that brings the mobs to the raid, for orderly disposal.  It normally looks something like this :<br>
<br>
1) Puller<br>
2) Peeler<br>
3) High cleric on raid<br>
4) High enchanter on raid <br>
5) CoH mage if available / Rogue for CR / body pulling<br>
6) Necro for twitch if avail / Rogue for CR / Body pulls.<br>
<br>
<br>
Pullers are normally Monk / Sk ( in hate 90 percent of the time its a monk ).<br>
<br>
Peelers are also the main raid assist, and the person who shouts &quot; ASSIST me on a (insert mob name here).  Usually this is a Warrior, SK, or Paladin.<br>
<br>
<br>
If you are not familiar with raids, the &quot;puller&quot; will go grab some mobs, and FD just outside of the range of the campsite where the raid is.  The &quot;peeler&quot; and &quot;puller&quot; then wait for some of the mobs to path back to where they were before the puller got them.  When there is an amount of mobs that the puller / peeler  feel the raid can handle, the peeler agros the mobs and brings them to camp.  Usually done with either Arrows, or some sort of ranged spell attack.<br>
<br>
The enchanter in the pull group is also aware of the number, and what type of mobs are inc.  The peeler will be on the most difficult to kill mob ( and thus, have the raid on that mob ), and the enchanters are supposed to mez the rest. The enchanter in the pull group has an advantage on the others, simply because they know exactly what is inc, and from where.<br>
<br>
When the mobs hit the camp, the enchanters run around mezzing them.  The best way to accomplish  this, is to pick a mob that is NOT the main mob ( it also needs to be mezzable), and attempt to mezz it.  If you are successful, tash it, and look around for your fellow enchanters.  If they are getting beat on, attempt to tash, then mez the mob that is beating on them.  It is important you keep one eye out for your fellow enchanters, and they do the same for you.<br>
<br>
AoE stuns in Hate are bad ( altho color flux seems to be ok.. i still wouldnt do it ).  I would stay away from AoE stuns or Mezz in fear untill you are 54 or 55 though.  Once you hit 55, i noticed a remarkable shift in what stuck the first time, and what didnt.<br>
<br>
Daeon already provided a list of mobs, and difficulty.. Memorize it. It is important for the enchanter to know which mobs are more difficult than others, and direct the peeler to those mobs if they are unsure.  <br>
<br>
I wouldnt plan on being the &quot;pull group&quot; enchanter till you are at least 51, with some raids to that plane under your belt.  Level is KING in eq, and the higher level your enchanters are, the more chance for success you have in a raid.  People talk about these miracle saves they have on raids, and you find out that the raid had 1 or 2 high level ( meaning 55+) enchanters there to help do that.<br>
<br>
Dont get upset when a higher level enchanter overwrites your mezzes.  This is harder than it sounds.  Enchanters are control freaks ( we have to be, to do the job ).  When the higher level enchanter overwrites your mezzes, it doesnt mean they think you cant handle your mob(s), all it means is they are going through their standard &quot;refresh the mezzes&quot; sequence, and re mezzing every mob that isnt moving.  This is why i said most raids end up with a &quot;point enchanter&quot;, and everyone else assisting that person.  Just mez your mobs as you can, and attempt to remez if you can.  If you cant, help with refreshing clarity, haste, or something else if you can.. The enchanters function as a team on raids, and the better the enchanter team functions, the smoother the raid tends to go.<br>

I've been on one raid where in fact the last enchanter got killed with 7 mobs left alive, and where two high level bards on the raid were able to take over mezzing (thanks Evesong and Eiwyn for saving that raid from a wipeout <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ). Usally enchanters will do all mezzing on a raid, but if the shit hits the fan don't hesitate to ask bards to lend a hand. They have AC to take a lot more beating than you can, and can often pull through where and enchanter would get killed. To be successful a bard would need to be high enough for Song of Twilight though, so 53+ is definitely required, and still higher is better. Also, don't tash a mob mezzed by a bard, as SoT has a magic resistance debuff component, and tash will overwrite the song breaking mez. <p>Ulaian Moonleaf <BR>

<br>
   Female Revs, sometimes called &quot;cats on crack&quot;, are generally more feared than the males.  It's because they're enchanter mobs (the males are magician mobs).  While they don't show up with enchanter pets in tow, they still cast enchanter buffs on themselves, including a haste spell (SLTW, I think), feedback and *resist magic*.<br>
   The first reaction of most enchanters to female revs is to tash them.  Avoid that if possible, since this will usually fatally aggro them on you and then after that the rev will run around inside the camp killing until someone gets it under control.<br>
   If you're having a lot of trouble mez'ing them, try hitting them with the most powerful dispell magic you have, then try it again.  You'll notice it's a lot easier!  This has the added benefit of slowing down how fast they attack.<br>
   The same applies to the Inny Cleric mobs in the zone as well, though they also have a higher inherent MR, but a dispell will make them easier to mez as well.<br>
   The biggest benefit to dispelling over tash'ing first is that dispell is a much lower aggro spell than tash, and it's much easier to channel through female rev beating on you once she's lost her haste.<br>
<br>
   Just be sure that *everyone* knows you're going to be dispelling or else the shamans and other enchanters will have fits. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  /wink Arodan <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ullorianlanys.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Llorian Lanys</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I live here.... get out.</span><br> <font color=#000033>(5/29/01 3:46:59 pm)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Advice on Planes from high level enchanters</span><hr size=1> Rofl yeah =)<br>
<br>
Dispell is great on unmezzables ( spite golems ), and on female revenants in particular.  They DO have sltw on themselves, which is 50 percent haste.<br>
<br>
Dont dispell every mob, but , coordinate with the lead shaman on which type mobs you are going to dispell first.  Nothing pisses off a shaman more than casting slow 3 times for 250 mana a pop to get it to stick, and have it dispelled 2 seconds later <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

All very helpful information.<br>
  I think I will do my first planes raid at 47 even if that is too young.  Just so I can go up and be the buffer or something and learn whatever I can while there.<br>
  Not sure I would want to be part of the pull, peel team.  Sounds like a TON of responsibility.  I take it pretty personal when I cause any deaths.  So maybe I just need to build my confidence some more.<br>

If you do go at that level, i would suggest you be like the 3rd enchanter on the raid.  With 2 other enchanters on the enchanter team, there is a much better margin for when you will get resisted.<br>
<br>
You WILL get resisted at 47, and you will get resisted a lot, no matter WHAT your Charisma is etc. Just be prepared for that, and make sure you have a decent , attentive cleric.<br>
<br>
Being an enchanter on a raid is a lot of pressure no matter whether your in the pull group or not.  Its something a lot of us thrive on.  Raids to hate and fear are generally fun for enchanters, specially if there are not 4 or 5 of us there.  It is true that being in the pull group is usually more responsability, as well.  <br>
<br>
Sometimes its a sobering thought to know that a mistake by you will not only kill YOU, but many other people ( and possibly wipe out your raid ).  I am not saying this to scare you at all, but, being an enchanter is sort of a pressure packed post, and it gets to be more pressure on raids.  This is one reason our class tends to be so Egotistical <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
When you go on whatever raid you go on, keep an open line of communication to the other enchanters there.  Ask questions if your not sure which mobs are harder to mezz ( try to do this in between pulls though hehe).  <br>
<br>
On a big pull, if you see 7-10 mobs inc and you manage to lock down 3-4 of them, send a tell to the other ench telling them which mobs you have.  Something as simple as &quot; i have the TT, the FF and 2 shvers, 50m &quot; ( which translates into i have the Tenticle terror, the fetid fiend, and 2 shiverback apes , lets them know which mobs you have ( and thus, they dont have to worry about), and also a mana status for you.  Evac is normally called on a raid by the pull group enchanter, so it is not a bad thing for that person to know how much mana the other enchanters have.<br>
<br>
I am not advocating telling them on every pull, because that isnt necessary. I am just saying that always keep in mind that the enchanters on a raid function as a team, usually with the high enchanter the &quot;point&quot; of that team, so , on big pulls or whatever keep the lines of communication open.<br>
<br>
Bleh... BOY can i ramble =P<br>
