<br>
Was auctioning in EC &quot;trading/selling fbss, will add some plat for a froggy robe&quot;.<br>
<br>
Aonellron says I'll trade a froggy robe for the fbss. (Says he is bored with his necro and wants to play a warrior. See later why this is important).<br>
<br>
Great I think, so we agree the trade. Then he says he wants me to handover the fbss to him and he'll bring is necro from OS and handover the robe.<br>
<br>
Hmm.<br>
<br>
Well I suggest how about I tp my wizard over to Kunark and we can meet up there and do the trade. &quot;Hey dewd you can trust me, I'm honourable&quot;. *cough*.<br>
<br>
So I petition a guide. Hey maybe we can catch a scammer in action.<br>
<br>
In the meantime I agree with Aonellron to meet at the WC tp point. So I log in my wizzie, bring her back from Kunark to the WC tp point (I was expecting the guys necro to be there.) Anyway he starts going on again &quot;give me the fbss and I'll bring on my necro etc&quot; &quot;you can trust me I'm honourable.&quot; So I suggest &quot;well why don't you bring your necro, give me the robe and then I'll give you the fbss.&quot;<br>
<br>
Silence for a moment. Then &quot;You want me to trust you with the robe, dude I ain't going to do that.&quot;<br>
<br>
At this point the guide turns up, I explain what's happening. He says he couldnt restore any items if I was scammed and suggest I don't go ahead with the deal, especially as Aonellron is only level 1 and will probably just &quot;disappear&quot;. (Aonellron is anon so I couldn't tell his level. So I think the guide and tell Aonellron sorry mate, I ain't going to trade with you.<br>
<br>
He carries on spamming me &quot;dude, trade&quot; etc until I finally get fed up and tell him &quot;Either your next message is, I'm bringing my necro back from OS and we'll do the trade with him, or you're going on ignore.&quot; Needless to say after his next response it was /ignore Aonellron.<br>
<br>
Later that evening I get a tell from a level 53 necro (M somoething or other) along the lines of &quot;I do have the robe but I ain't going to trade with you now&quot;. After a sharp rejoinder he also went on ignore.<br>
<br>
Just a warning.<br>
<br>
(On a happier note I later traded the fbss and a treeweave for a froggy robe. So big grins all round.)<br>

This is not the first, not the second, nor the third time someone has claimed to be my twink. This happens to be the fourth time. Someone, who I suspect is in my guild, is using my name to convince others that they should transfer an item to my so called twink (the twink is a level one character which the scammer creates, then calls it &quot;Tykin's twink&quot;, ex: Aonellron) is getting people to convince him one way or another. He did this scam to a friend of mine, my friend then gave the scammer ALL of equipment on BOTH his characters, loosing everything. The GMs of course did nothing. Someone in Institute, I don't remember his name, got scammed for his DW gaunts by someone claiming to be me. Now Impereal has gathered some new evidence of who this scammer could be. One minute after his run in with Aonellron he saw a level 53 necro with a froggy robe appear in front of him, in WC. The necro's name also started with an M, although he can't remember what it is exactly. Now one name comes to mind here... Morzinynin. Morz. is a 53 necro with a froggy robe, and is also in my guild (he could easily see when im not on and then strike, and I won't be in the guild for any more than a week longer). Rose.. Impereal and I were talking about the scam and what all went on today and it seems Morz is the main target, we will see what Valtron can do.. and see what Morz has to say. <p>Tykin

The moral of this story -- DO NOT TRUST PEOPLE WHO SAY THEY ARE TWINKS OF OTHER CHARACTERS! Unless you know the person do not trust them.

<br>
On the note of transfers this way...  I was asked to do this.  The only way I see to make this sensical is to have them give you the item first.  Then they log back on and the transaction is completed.  Worked well when I did it.  Person asked to give him the item, then he would log on another char and pay for it... I said &quot;hell no! you give me the pp and I will make the switch.&quot;  Him being a green con poorly geared, I suspected a scammer.  They said, &quot;ok&quot; and he gave me the pp, then logged on the other char and I gave him the cane of tranquil... trust no one but yourself... thats sad, but true <p>     :hatMini:hat

I had a guildie scammed out of 2k (yes i know it's not a lot but still scammed)  by someone claiming to be me.  Kinda looked really funny when i logged on and found out i owed someone 2k i was loaned and i hadn't been on all night.  The pretending to be someones Twink is a common scam i'm finding out.<br>

<br>
what a simple solution - thank you Guides for helping to protect others from scammers by getting them banned<br>
<br>
what could he have done... well lets seee  he could have tried to set up the scammer and got him a soulmark... nah just let ppl like that continue to scam... or at least escalted it if he didnt have the power to do that?  they know the account names.<br>

I agree that it would have been nice if it could have been turned into a sting operation and have put a 'soul mark' or whatever.  But the guide didnt want to be the one who said, &quot;ya.. do the trade and we can catch him!&quot; and then not be able to return the item that was scammed <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
The main thing to remember is that most people will talk to you as their main first if they really want you to transfer something.  If they do want to trade and think that you should give them item first then they log on their main, then they should have no problem doing it vice versa <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I lost over 6k a more ignorant way... it went poof one day when I was headed to make some jewelry (as my old enchie).  I was stumped and couldnt find it, I was the only one in the zone (erudian interior) and I didnt see it on the floor.  Needless to say I didnt get it back *sigh*.  at least you guys arent as stupid as me <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uhonir.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Honir </A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 6<br> <font color=#E9D756>(4/6/01 12:12:27 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.angelfire.com/amiga/kov/sdpred.gif WIDTH=130 HEIGHT=100></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Aonellron - beware of possible scammer</span><hr size=1> Just wanted to say that once when we were having a Kedge Raid I died got a rezz and my epic Shield of Falsehood was gone. This could not be it's a no drop item but I still search all over Kedge then ran back to the bank maybe I left it in there. No luck it was gone. I petition right away and shortly a guide came on and asked what happened? I told him everything I knew and around what time it happened. Claiming that I honestly didn't know what happened! The Guide said he will take the report and give it to Valtron and to repetition tommorrow. Next day I did repetitioned and Valtron sent me a tell and said he did get the report and check back on the log and in layman's term it went poofed. So he said just stay where I am at and a Guide will come and reimburse you. I thanked Valtron and waited. When the Guide showed up he proceeded on giving me my replacement but as soon he put it in trade my original poped back up. So here we have not only myself but the Guide scratching our heads and both said &quot;weird&quot; So sometimes and maybe more then we think there is flaws in the system but  The GM's does help on retrieving equipment if they know it was done by a glitch in the system but not by being ignorant of trusting somebody you don't know!<br>
