I realize abusive players are frustrating, but if VI wont do anything about it thats too bad.  It doesnt bother anyone else the way it bothers you.  That should tell you something, especially after 3 years of preaching how bad these people are and still no one has sided with you.

You claim to recall every thread and every post you've ever read.  How come you don't recall the thread where I proved you only came in to the thread after me, in order to try and flame me?  I posted first, and then you posted a flame completely unrelated to the thread or what I'd posted.  As a result, I correctly identified you as the stalker.  At that same time, there was a multipage thread you'd started on your misogynistic opinions on Spiderman the Movie, into which I never strayed for nearly a week.<br>

The (bad people) wanted to know who they should be retaliating against.<br>
This was helped of course by the way Ogmuk was more than happy to hand <br>
out IP information if it suited his purposes.<br>

But you see 'ingame' that is not so pervasive. I get tells from a variety of people.<br>
But I would say 95% of the server never heard of me now. All this shall fade.<br>

I dont read every post made on this forum. In fact I suspect I read less than 3%<br>
I already know that Verant sux. If people wish to waste their money let them.<br>
I maintain my account just to irritate the occasional fool that challenges my<br>
existance on the server. It also gives me (in my opinion) a legitimate right to post<br>
on this forum. It is my hope that someday Verant will alter itself, and play will become fun again. I must admit that is far-fetched.<br>
<br>
Since most posts on this forum are game related, and I am not involved I ignore them. <br>
<br>
In responce to your claim that I am stalking you. If I start a thread, I have a reason for doing it. If you post in that thread, what a surprise I respond.<br>
Now it is flatly obvious to everyone that you DO stalk both Mitch and me.<br>
I think stalking Mitch is unseemly and beneath even you. <br>
Yes I am sure you will deny it, and you will convince no one. Just read your own posts. You contribute nothing and merely try and insert yourself into existing arguments. You apparently have no real idea about the validity of the crusade,<br>
(done bother me with facts) and you spend no effort to try and find out.<br>
As I have said before you are nothing but a spoiler. Your imagination is obviously<br>
quite limited regardless of your cognitive abilities(whatever they are)<br>
yes you have learned as you go, and you copy other posters and myself now<br>
to make points occasionally. But it is all transparent to the other readers.<br>
Example: the ';' thread has NOTHING to do with you. So why exactly are you there?<br>
You contribute NOTHING. Your opinions are meaningless because there is no shared<br>
database. Now you are simply boring, and trite. I have no will to expend dealing with your chaff. It is YOUR chaff, you deal with it. You call me a liar when I am telling the truth, you in no way attempt to clarify any issue. Your like a child that<br>
delibretly takes his diaper off and smears the @#%$ around to demand attention.<br>
My patience for that is gone. I am not interested. Go spar with Skerry.<br>
Even your theoretical liberal bias is tripe. Please, just go away.<br>

And of course Ogmuk paid off every cleric on the server so his brother could claim the title of being the first monk to 50 on our server (like anyone remembers or cares about that anymore). <br>
<br>
Lucas was a A-hole but I never knew him to expliot. but I guess in his mind anyone who could accomplish something he cant, they MUST be cheating/explioting.<br>
<br>
Glad I missed all that, was haveing to much fun Roleplaying back then. <br>

Anyway,  as for noone siding with you,  I think quite a few people have indirectly sided with you.  In fact many many people have said they agree that exploitation is wrong, and abusive players is wrong.  In fact I think I posted it myself,  maybe I was just thinking about it,  in case Ididnt. <br>
<br>
yes abusive players are pains in the ass.  Anyone who intentionally trains is a jackoff and should go play agame more suited to their childish styles.<br>
<br>
I think what most folks are either amused or frightened or disgusted by,  is your zealot like nature.<br>

Go spar with skerry,   This will come back to you,  oh yes  somehow  someway  this will come back to you.   I havnt even been the biggest jerk to you and you curse that upon me. . egads.

Naele - Lucas didnt exploit? uhh Have you asked Verant? Oh maybe you dont know<br>

about Lucas is when word got out about HK. But why bother telling you. You seem <br>
to have all the facts that you need. As for the clerics, they were busy elsewhere.<br>
I sure as hell wasnt gonna ask Remdar. leiran was with Fyrnis doing something somewhere, Ice had the Dwarf Cleric. That was that. Not a mystery.<br>
But most of the time it was me soling. But I made it.<br>

I wasn't slamming you for labelling me a stalker.  I still think you were wrong, but that's not much of a beef, aye?  In any event, I didn't follow him around (keeping an eye on him via /friend is a different matter) and only made one /ooc comment in EC regarding a scam he was trying to perpetrate on someone at the time.  And Trayler scammed me for 250pp, when I was L29 and had never seen that much money at one time.  Please don't exaggerate, for it only feeds the delusions of our favorite Mushroom.<br>
<br>
Mushroom Boy:  And this thread or Uberitis had anything to do with you?  Sorry, chump, but any public thread is open to be commented on by anyone.  Go to IRC or something if you want to have a private convo.<br>
<br>
Why the hell would I have to start my own thread to address a subject matter?   That's your particular obscenity.  You didn't start this thread, so maybe you need to go the fvck away.  Your wacky opinions are still meaningless and appear to be pulled out of your ass.  <br>
<br>
My alleged lack of ability to create an audience is important how?  As that's not my purpose, I guess that's not a problem.  As it's clearly yours due to the diarrhea of the keyboard you keep demonstrating, I continue to pity you.<br>
<br>
I contribute nothing?  And you do?  How?  Sorry, I've contributed quite a bit in the discussion on the death penalty, the Pledge of allegiance, and in the never-ending amusement of trying to get you to focus on reality, fact and logic.  The only thing you've contributed to here would be case studies in obsessive-compulsive disorder, delusional paranoia, and hero-worship.<br>
<br>
&quot;no shared database&quot;  What?<br>
<br>
&quot;the ';' thread has NOTHING to do with you. So why exactly are you there?&quot;  And you're here because...?<br>
<br>
&quot;You call me a liar when I am telling the truth&quot;  Nope.  I called you a liar when you claimed to have only come into a thread to support Mitch, yet your first attack in that thread on me was before Mitch ever appeared, and before anyone said a single thing about her.  You followed me into that thread.<br>
<br>
&quot;you in no way attempt to clarify any issue&quot;  Wrong, and you are trying to parrot me again, and poorly.  That's your m.o., not mine.<br>
<br>
&quot;Even your theoretical liberal bias is tripe.&quot;  Really?  How so?  Again, rather than pull shyt out of your growing ass, perhaps you'd care to suggest a basis for this &quot;comment.&quot;  Further, when did I ever say I was a liberal?  I'm quite happily middle of the road with viewpoints on different subjects that bounce all over the spectrum.  More of my conclusions would fit the liberal agenda than the conservative, but I'm neither.  I'm a thinking person, not a stereotype.  Anyone whose opinions are purely one side or the other, clearly hasn't used his brain.<br>
<br>
Skerry:  I understood it well.  You decided you wanted to fight, called a comment a jab and threw in an ad hominem for good measure, when nothing I said was either.  You were being a hypocrite and a bigot, and I called you on it.  Sorry if that embarassed you. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/udwarkarn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dwarkarn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 4280<br> <font color=#E9D756>(7/19/02 4:11:45 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3464.topic&index=282>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ahh now </span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://users.bigpond.com/raymies/threadwontdie.jpg"><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--> <p><center><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=6929">Rolelen Dwarkarn - 60 Warlord </a><br>

But, in this case, it is a problem you share with a great number of people.  They didn't invalidate your hard work.  You LET THEM invalidate it.  By that I mean that you let it get to you.  I'm not going to get into this thing about whether or not Lucas exploited.  Of course, I can say with full certainty that he was a dick.  But anyway, you should still be proud of your accomplishments.  So what if someone wants to cheat their way to 50.  That doesn't affect you in any way.  I can still see all of the old arguments.  So-and-so guild rode in on our coattails; it makes a mockery of our accomplishments.  Or, so-and-so guild watched us kill Uber X mob so they could do it the easy way; it detracts from our accomplishments.  No it doesn't.  That's ludicrous.  If the guy wants to cheat, so what?  If he's not hurting anyone else, what does it matter?  He's only hurting himself.<br>
<br>
The only way someone else's actions affect you is if you let them (keep in mind that I mean if these people aren't doing anything to you directly, like KSing or training you or whatever).  Don't worry so much about everyone else.  I think if everyone could do this, people would be a lot happier in game. <p>"I will take love wherever I find it and offer it to everyone who will take it, seek knowledge from those wiser, and teach those who wish to learn from me" - Duane Allman</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/udwarkarn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dwarkarn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 4281<br> <font color=#E9D756>(7/19/02 4:38:09 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3464.topic&index=284>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ahh now </span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Back then the people know who the xp leaders were.

All your work? News flash this is a video game Captain Crusader, no matter how much you want to tell yourself it is work it's not and won't ever be work. Chiteng they never invalidated anything you had done, the invalidation happened only because you let it. You said you were proud of what you had accomplished up to the point you found out they were exploiting, how does the fact they were exploiting make you any less proud or change what you had accomplished?<br>

Fight what exactly? Someone who cheats in a Video Game? Chiteng Real Life is full of cheaters why don't you pour some of your endless energy into doing something for the world instead of dwelling on sh|t that happened in a video game years ago, newsflash sparky but from what I have seen you are the only one that cares what happened back then. A Crusader without any supporters now there's a concept!<br>

Chiteng that is a different type of cheating than you used in your example, the type of cheating used in your UO example <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> does</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> effect you, in the example you gave about Lucas the only reason he effected you is because you let him invalidate your work, just because he got a higher level than you by cheating you felt you no longer had anything to be proud of, sounds like jealousy to me.<br>

First of all WTF is &quot;Erollis Marr&quot;? Have you discovered some secret server the rest of us don't know about? Do you realise Chiteng that the world is always going to have evil in it and so are online video games. Good cannot survive without Evil, the Yin and the Yang, Chiteng your crusade is pointless because you seem to be the only one that cares about it. <br>
<br>
If i were to log on to Everquest everyday and everyone was pleasant and nice to me I actually think I would vomit, we need villains on our server Chiteng they spice things up a bit and give us something to talk and or b|tch about, and we need you Chiteng because you give us something to laugh at.<br>

Once again Carathos explained what i was trying to explain, but much more clearly.  Chit, your took what he MIGHT have been doing personally.  You let it invalidate your accomplishments.<br>
<br>
Remember when you attacked the fact that my sig says 60 Warlord?  Thats an attempt at invalidating *my* accomplishments.  Did i let it bother me? did i take it personally? no, and no.  I put that in my sig because, like you, i was proud of the accomplishment i made. <br>
<br>
If you didnt take these things personally, and didnt take alot of this stuff so seriously, i think you would be much happier playing online games, and maybe more happier irl if you are like this irl.  <br>
<br>
Just try to take it easy, and not let this stuff to get to you.  <br>
<br>
Aside from all that, in 3 years of preaching, you have not accomplished anything.  I think maybe its time to let it go, and if you cant do the above, at least find a new crusade that you and your &quot;nemisis&quot; havent beat to death.  This is ALL rehash.<br>
<br>
GL man, honestly, however funny this may be, i hope you can listen to the advice i and carathos, and a few others are trying to give. <p><a href='http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=248327'>Birren Anklebiter</a><BR>
