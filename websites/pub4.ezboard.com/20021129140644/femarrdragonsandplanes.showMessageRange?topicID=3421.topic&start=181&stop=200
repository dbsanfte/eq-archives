guys, do you really wanna end up like a new mitch and dwark? or another carathos and Shardon? or another Darmu and Tormentcia/Sagemon? don't do it, there's enough assholes in this game already. We don't need anymore.<br>
<br>
This conversation can serve no purpose any longer. The only things i see going on now are egos getting bruised and people trying to retaliate. STOP IT.<br>
<br>
Just remember, This is a message board, not a political debate. Sure, Merenth doesn't know if yumten knows right from wrong, but Trech's feet smell bad. And Yaraa and Bayo are sweet as pie, cute as the day is long, lord love a duck. But people, KNOCK THIS CRAP OFF. THANKS <p><a href="http://www.saraquael.com/Images/darmu.jpg" target="_blank">

<br>
&lt;&lt;You dont know if he knows right from wrong.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
Yes, I do. he did wrong, He doesnt recognize the fact that he did wrong. This is what is called evidence. In fact you admitted this several posts ago. That you now change your mind doesnt surprise me<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;All you know is he chose wrong in this situation and later tried to play it off.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
uhmmm no. What he did was deny wrongdoing while admitting to commission of the act. YOU are trying to change the facts by mischaracterizing what he did. I am not sure what you mean by playing it off but if you re read what he said, it is clear that he does not recognize the wrong of his action. You can mischaracterize this as anything you want but it doesnt change the fact.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt; We sometimes choose the wrong path even though we know its the wrong path.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
Obviously this is true. SO what?  It is NOT what this child did. He clearly did not admit or recognize the wrong of his action. He states that quite clearly. He blames us for thinking he did something wrong. This does NOT fit what he did; It is your mischaracterization of his actions to suit your desire to hijack this thread and bend it to suit your own perverse pleasures.<br>
<br>
Here are some of the things he said which clearly prove to me that he does not see the wrong in what he did.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt; the most that could happen to me is I get sued and she gets some money from me (my parents)&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
see he doesnt care about anything but what might happen to him, same as with his threads indignant over the fact he might be kicked from his guild.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;If you think what I said was bad you need to get out more&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
this is pretty clearly him saying what he said isnt bad. why do you deny this?<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt; If it bother you that much than whatever&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
see above<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;It was made in a joking manner&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
as if this excuses his offending people or mitigates the offense<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt; I find it funny that something like this has stirred up such a buncha posts&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
again, he doesnt understand that it has inflamed people because of how wrong it was. He still thinks it is funny, even after being shown how it offended someone.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt; I am sure you have heard worse. If not whatever&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
as if this makes what he did ok-again, this CLEARLY indicates he does NOT recognize the wrong in what he did, something you deny<br>
<br>
Now you can try to make like none of this shows that he doesnt know the wrong of his actions but that doesnt make it so.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;Im not saying Yum DOES know right from wrong. Im simply admitting the fact that I do not know Yumten, I do not know if he knows right from wrong&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
What the hell more do you need than his own damn words and actions to demonstrate that he does not? He has more than amply demonstrated that he does not. Your refusal to admit this now, is a reflection on you, not on him. Judges and juries make this determination all the time based on evidence. We have the evidence. Your denying it doesnt change the fact.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;will be more than willing to give the guy a second chance. Even more so now that hes been shown the consequences of such actions&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
I believe most if not all of us would have offered a second chance had he been contrite. Scroll up and re read what he said and tell me that he deserves a second chance. Do you not agree that an offender must be contrite to deserve a second chance? He has been shown the consequences of his actions and is only upset that he might be kicked out of his guild. He expresses disdain for the fact his actions might cost his parents money. He expresses no sorrow for offending someone. How does that mean, as you state, that he &quot;even more&quot; deserves a second chance? In the face of his defiance and attacks, how can he be offered a second chance? He has shown nothing to make anyone believe he knows his wrong and wont just do it again. Based on his words, he has given us no reason to think he wont just do it again. Charles Manson is still in jail because he has given us no indication of remorse or any reason to believe he wont duplicate his atrocities. While there is no comparison of the offenses, there is a total similarity of the attitudes after the fact. Manson thinks the whole thing is a joke. Yumten calls this all a joke. Manson has denied wrongdoing. Ditto for Yumten. Again, I am not comparing the acts, just the denial of any wrongdoing after the fact. I dont &quot;know&quot; either of them. I dont have to. Their words speak for themselves.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;Being that you supposedly know this then you should be able to reasonably hypothosize about Yumtens actions when confronted with a choice of right and wrong could you not? You see the absurdity in this I hope. &gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
I sure do. Your point is TOTALLY absurd. You are trying to make me defend something I never said. YOU say I should be able to hypothesize something. I never said I could so why would I defend YOUR fantasy?  You are just making stuff up. I have explained over and over my logic for what I DID say. You keep avoiding this by bringing up something totally absurd which I did not say. Are you saying there has never been ANYONE who doesnt know right from wrong?  I am quite sure that no one has ever done EVERY wrong possible. Does this mean that NO ONE exists who has not known right from wrong? What are you trying to say? If someone who rapes, pillages, steals, jaywalks, cheats on his taxes, his wife and ninja loots but helps little old ladies across the street, are they not bad? I dont have to be able to predict this child's actions to judge him on the evidence of his own words. I am judging him on what he HAS said and HAS done, not on the basis of what he might do in some fantasy scenario you make up. Try sticking to the facts. This is not about who or what I know. This is about the evidence we have straight from this child's own words.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;because this one action is not even in the universe of enough evidence to condemn someone as not knowing right from wrong. Is that so hard for you to understand?&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
Gee I dont know . . . Is it so hard for YOU to understand despite being told over and over and over, that it isnt the action which proves this? It is the many many things he said afterwards which prove that he does not recognize right from wrong. He does wrong. He denies it. He does not recognize the wrong of his action.  It is very simple. You can play lawyer and present a defense to mitigate the facts but you cant change the facts. You can say he is a first time offender and we should go easy on him. You can say everyone does it. You can we have all heard worse. You can say he is only 16. You can say he deserves a second chance. You can play courtroom lawyer all you want but it doesnt change what he said and did. <br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;you mean everyone that has made reference to our little exchange right? All one or two of em? /snicker&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
keep counting. more and more keep coming out <br>
/three musketeers<br>
<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;Maybe you can bend over and eat a train with your brown eye. Just because I dont speak like a stuck up fvck from timbuktoo dont mean i dont know what Im talking about. However, it does give you ample room to try to change the subject doesnt it?&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
nice try   I have stuck to the topic. You are the one who brings fantasies about bank robbery into a discussion of someone offending a stranger with sexual harrassment. YOU are the one who tried to insult me because I can actually speak english. You have trouble communicating so you make yourself feel better by trying to make the issue one of my abilty to sommunicate my thoughts in a coherent manner, not one of your inability to do so. When I point out how ridiculous you appear when you try to mimic me, you laughably accuse me of changing the subject. Again, it was you who introduced this side subject, not me. I am sorry you think that anyone who speaks english instead of d00d or ebonics is stuck up but that is just the way you are I guess.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;My headache is from you being dumb. See now im just insulting you. Why? Cause I can. Oh... and I want to give you more reason to try to change the subject&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
lol   actually you can try but you seem to have trouble insulting me. Last time you tried, it was a compliment. I dont take the fact that I can speak english as an insult like you meant it.  As for saying I am dumb . . . It is a better attempt at an insult but when I consider the source . . . it just doesnt carry much weight.<br>

<br>
What I said, is that you characterize what he did as something you do all the time. You said that right here:<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;I for one joke all the time about EVERYTHING and anything&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
You said this in CONTEXT of your discussion of what he did. If you did not mean that all he did was joke, something you do all the time, just what DID you mean? I am actually applying your words PRECISELY in the context you used them. If you meant them in some other way, please clarify.<br>
<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;&lt;Trecht says:<br>
because this one action is not even in the universe of enough evidence to condemn someone as not knowing right from wrong. Is that so hard for you to understand?<br>
<br>
<br>
./CHEER Trecht I could not agree more &gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
I agree with this statement as well. The problem is that focusing ONLY on the original act, leaves out the whole body of evidence which we have in the form of the child's own words in posts on this thread. No matter how many times I repeat this, some folks want to ignore this body of evidence.<br>

If I join your chat channel and dont like what you say I can leave.

If you come up to me uninvited and unprovoked out of nowhere and direct offensive and sexually harrassing excrement at me, I will avail myself of the report feature of the game first and the ignore feature second.

&lt;&lt;When you make posts that look like god damn term papers, they either 1. Get read just so people like ME can laugh and make fun of people like YOU for caring soooo much, or 2. just get skimmed over since they're so tedious and boring.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
Ya dont like it dont read it. If I didnt have to say the same thing over and over and over without some people seeing it, I wouldnt have to resort to such tedious and precise use of words to communicate.<br>

Ive resigned myself to the fact that Im just not gonna be able to get it through your thick ass skull. Youre not dumb. Youre arrogant. You refuse to accept that human nature sometimes makes us do the wrong thing and even further makes us try to justify it to our peers cause we dont like to do the wrong thing even when we do have an inherent understanding of right and wrong. So thats fine. I have to learn to accept that there are people out there that think they know everything. Youre one of em. <br>

So thats fine. I have to learn to accept that there are people out there that think they know everything. Youre one of em. &gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
First I have not denied that we do wrong things. I have freely stated that. This is just more of you putting words in my mouth and ignoring what I actually said. You will never convince anyone of anything by confusing the issue with your off the point fantasies and trying to make me defend things that came out of your mouth and not mine. <br>
<br>
Secondly, You are right in that I do NOT admit that we are all snivelling cowards who wont own up to our wrongdoing (that is my characterization of your words and I am identifying it as such). If we accept your premise, to what do you credit the fact that some of us own up to our wrongdoing and others are too cowardly, immature, degenerate (or whatever adjective you think fits here) to do so? <br>
<br>
Thirdly, if and I consider it a mighty big if, this kid knows he did wrong and is just trying to brazenly tough his way through it, wouldnt he change his course when he saw it wasnt working? If he is doing what you propose, would it be fair to say he is doing this to save face? Once he sees that he is still being pilloried, wouldnt he try another course to save face, if that was his goal?<br>
<br>
Fourth, it seems to me that what you are suggesting is just as bad, maybe worse. If I understand what you are saying, he is merely refusing to admit to doing what he realizes was wrong in an attempt to save face. Of course this has the result of inflaming the community, perpetuating the wrong he did previously and denying his victim her due, compounding his wrongdoing. <br>
I think you are splitting hairs by arguing over whether he learned right from wrong or whether he learned how to properly deal with his wrongdoing. It seems to me that this is all part and parcel of the same lesson which I believe he has failed to learn from his parents.<br>
<br>
Last, you are so transparent it is humorous to watch you squirm. I offered my opinion. You said I was wrong. You made up things, misquoted and mischaracterized what I said, ignored parts that you couldnt refute, resorted to insults, accused me of changing the subject for daring to answer your attempts at insulting me. Now that all your theatrics and fantasy have been pointed out clearly and all too patiently, you try to back out by saying I am too arrogant. I have no problem admitting when I am wrong (unlike you and Yumten). If I misspoke or my logic/opinion was wrong and you showed me where it was wrong, I would retract or rephrase my words and credit you with showing me my error. What you call arrogance however is my refusal to submit to your bullying, name calling, fabricating, fantasizing, insults, and obtuse posts.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt; You dont need pattern, all you need is one incident and hearsay. &gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
You are painting with a mighty broad brush. The advantage of actually thinking about and carefully composing my replies to your drivel, is that I can here and now defy you to show ONE example of where I credited or depended on hearsay in ANY of my posts. I am not one of those who referred to, or based my opinion on,  the possibility of other such offenses by the child in question. I am not one who brought up why he was removed from a previous guild on which to base my opinion. I relied strictly on the offender's own words and admissions. His repeated posts DO constitute a pattern. He had ample opportunity to change his attitude. He even came on and tried to take back his first several posts as being the product of his anger . . . understandable, maybe even forgiveable but for the fact that his subsequest posts continued on in the same vein. <br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;Its a common thing for chatty arrogant fvcks like you to use someones speech or grammar as an excuse to invalidate their point. Its also stupid. &gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
You dont really think you can get away with this one do you? I commented on your poor communication skills as part of a reply to your trying to &quot;insult&quot; me for actually being able to use the english language. I did not need to use your grammar or language skills to invalidate your point. Your point was invalid on its own and I spent way more time showing you why than it deserved. My lowering myself to joust with your insults and weak humor had nothing to do with the substantive portion of our exchange.<br>

<br>
Trech,<br>
You don't need to resort to cursing in your posts to get your point across.  I think it is obvious to all here that you and Merentha have a clear difference in opinion that isn't going to be resolved.  Cursing and name-calling just detract from the strength of your arguments.  Your selection of words is a conscious choice on your part, and gives a slant of its own when people read them.<br>
<br>
You and I also disagree.  You said (to Merentha):<br>
&quot;You refuse to accept that human nature sometimes makes us do the wrong thing and even further makes us try to justify it to our peers cause we dont like to do the wrong thing even when we do have an inherent understanding of right and wrong.&quot;<br>
<br>
I can accept this statement completely.  Unfortunately, I also feel Yumtum's continued rationalizations to justify or lessen the inappropriateness of his behavior also precludes him from  receiving forgiveness.  He publicly denies understanding what he did as being very wrong in this thread.  <br>
<br>
I will grant you that he <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> may</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> know inside his head that he made a mistake, but it isn't for certain.  Maybe he really doesn't know?  If he in fact does not, I feel he is doomed to repeat the mistake again.  Of course, we aren't in his head, so we won't know unless he posts here again to answer on that score.<br>
<br>
To all who think this thread has gone on long enough:  Of course you are free to stop reading this thread at any time. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Making snide comments in an attempt to stop it merely provides another bump to the top of the forum, and is actually a good way to keep it going.  This is R&amp;F after all. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
But bump it all you want with your cries to halt it.  The more that read (or re-read) about Yumtum's rude sexual harassment of a COMPLETE STRANGER, the better.<br>

I think I took it the right way. It was fine. But did I really give the impression of not being calm? I was away from this board for over 24 hours ( I know, shame on me) and when I came back there were 5 posts I saw a need to reply to. That is all. It wasnt like I was posting 5 times in reply to the same post in a fury.  I rarely post in anger, I cant type well when I am banging on the keyboard. Even with Stench I reply to his weak attempts at making a point calmly before lowering myself to his level and having fun matching insults with him. <p>I think, therefore I am . . .

Ahhh, the miscommunication that can occur with the written word. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   When I wrote calm down, I meant with the repeated posts all in a row, not with your tone being overly angry.<br>
<br>
Where I can see the posts showing up in your absence, and your wanting to reply to them all, it seems most of page 6 is almost all yours. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Give the opposition a bit of time is all I meant.  Possibly using a little redaction before clicking <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Add Reply</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> to an overly verbose post might help as well.  (I admit to having a problem w/ this myself sometimes. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> )<br>
<br>
Also, when posts get really long, even when broken up with extra carriage returns in lieu of paragraph indents, there is a tendency to skim them.  If there is no separation among paragraphs, it definitely adds to the eyestrain and the more readers skip reading them entirely.  (I find myself wanting to post PARAGRAPHS ARE YOUR FRIENDS! in almost every thread where someone does this...)<br>
<br>
Oh, and as to why I've been more prevalent on these boards than usual lately. (An unasked question I know.)  I've been locked out of my class boards (at The Crucible) &amp; Allakhazam's at work, and things have been REALLY slow there.  So it is either here, Eqtraders, or a few guild boards to visit while at the office. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Boredom equates with a higher postcount I guess, lol.  So many of these threads are worthless, they aren't worth commenting on.  Writing against sexual harassment is something I'm happy to do though.<br>
