That is a fundamental background design flaw inherent in the system that verant uses to reward players for their leveling and organization.  The duty of the community, if it wishes to survive in relative peace, is to organize a system to reduce and set out a way to arbitrate the clashing that will inevitably happen.  The duty of the members includes respecting the system and embodying fairplay where ever they find themselves.  The failure of respect leads only to a place none of us want, a place of rampant kill stealing, spawn hogging and totalitarian like nationalism(guildism).  Friday night was yet another example of United Independent trampling upon any notion of comunication, fairplay and respect.<br>
<br>
The system that has abided on Erollisi Marr for around a year is one of comunication and sharing.  Da`Kor I have to acknowledge as the ones who began this system more formally with a Trakanon and Venril Sathir rotation.  Magister has carried on with the precedent set by their founding members from Da`kor even if sometimes lack of comunication leads to mishaps.  For some time they have had the number of people to kill most everything, yet usually through simple appeal to respect they don't.  Midnight Sojourn and Storm's Fury followed up in their wake and try to abide by the same system.  The system of open comunication and preplanning what guild is going to be doing what, and in the case of sometimes we are both in the same spot at the same time our earlier dealings of respect and sharing set a precedence for talking it out and coming to an agreement for that spawn with little if any resentment festering.  Affliction has earned this respect in regards to Storm's Fury and really so has Divine Grace even though sometimes they have a hard time comunicating.  <br>
<br>
United Independent has set itself up for poor interguild relations through a lack of any effort expended at communication.  Not once have I recieved a tell from anyone in United Independent without soliciting it myself by asking them.  Usually I have no idea what they are doing untill they start just showing up for a mob while we have a small preliminary group there.  Then after they get up to a size about equal to our group is when I ask them what's going on and do we want to work something out.  Often to no or little response.  Only when they feel they have the upper hand do I recieve any kind of communication from them.  Friday night it was from Mackentil and I quote, 'we have 38 here we're going to pull'.  Showing all the respect they have for any other guild or any system of working things out to prevent neanderthalic l33t d3wds from taking over Emarr.<br>
<br>
The problem we face is that each low is met with a lowering of the respect shown to other players, whom usually had nothing to do with the original offense, by the aggrieved person.  That trend continues and a slow erosion of the values of our comunity begins.  Thinking back looking for a begining to the recent(last 6months) troubles I see the Lodizal, Turtlegate as Glor put it so well, as a big player in respect going south on Emarr.  A spawn that is somewhat timeable, everyone wants and is doable with one lv 60 group if not less leads to a lot of bickering.  As well as that zone having such asinine visibility when it is snowing, yes it is 'emersive' but it leads to a hell of a lot of misunderstanding, arguing and bad blood more then it leads to a fun game.  Once one guild 'wronged' another guild on lodizal it was down hill from there with the wronged guilds doing wrong to other people etc.<br>
<br>
We must keep our standards high of what we give to our fellow players on emarr as well as what we expect.  It is imposible to receive, and quite silly to demand, respect without having shown any yourselves first.  Respect is the same on a guild level and a personal level.  Trying to seperate the two is unrealistic.  The actions of your guild, like the actions of your country, are the opinions and willingness to cooperate with the leadership in decisions they make.  Talking to individual United Independent members I cannot find one person that activly condones how the Vindicator was pulled by United Independent after Storm's Fury cleared the mobs in front of him, were ready to kill him and had a monk there actively splitting him from his guards.  But it happened anyway because not one of the people in UI who individually frowned on such an action would speak out against it.  How can you allow your name to be dragged through so much mud?  If it is the leadership then form a new guild.  Storm's Fury had Drall who was off and on an ass and we had, and deserved, a poor reputation while he was our figurehead.  The only way we changed that is through our questioning Drall on every choice he wanted and telling him no we would not cooperate in screwing over other players.  He became frustrated and quit, to the betterment of SF.  If it is a pervasive guild culture that you are a part of then please stop demanding and wondering why no one shows you any kind of respect.<br>
<br>
Don't be so absorbed in your nationalism to not realize that your neighbors are being incinerated.  Each voice raised in a no counts towards detering leadership from following a particular line of action.  If you feel the need to spout of some propagandic jargon in response to this, first take some time to actually think it over and post it well.  Just as I have done here.<br>
<br>
One thing the server cannot afford is open retaliation and bickering between a large portion of the upper tier guilds.  Can you imagine how shitty EQ would be with unguilded twink train bombs, rampant dispelling, KS groups and quite a few nasty ugly things just to screw over guilds on raids because they have totally screwed you over because they were screwed over by someone else?  I ask United Independent to think about the consequences of their actions and refusal to communicate and build up reputation and a feeling of respect.  Stealing our pull of the Vind almost resulted in a gift of our pulling the statue for you, though at an inopportune time.<br>
<br>
We as a guild will not, and cannot accept how you dealt with things on Friday.  And if there is not a change and soon in how United Independent, or any other guild in the same circumstance, acts then there will be repercussions.  If not from within the guild then from outside the guild.  Please just talk to me.  I don't hate you, I'm not a bad guy.  All I want is to be able to plan things out to lessen the impact of scarce resources.  I wont give away everything so don't bother asking for that.  I will share and have shared in the past with guilds that take time and have the patience to build up their respect, with Storm's Fury and the server in general.  And untill we have some kind of respect going we will be continuously unable to work things out when both guilds are already there.<br>
<br>
Think before you act.  Hold your guild leadership accountable for the actions of your guild as an entity.  Communicate with the people who share your server.  And one thing I learned back at orc1 in East Commonlands, don't steal other people's pulls.  <br>

<br>
From your perspective, you see UI as guild with absolutely no morals and no leadership. You seem to think that all our members just run around to KS from the mighty storm's fury guild and that we respect no one.<br>
<br>
Rewind a bit, to let's say 3 months ago.<br>
<br>
UI found out Klandicar was up, we have never killed him before and decided to give him a shot. There was a informal rotation established for him and Zlandicar. Between SF MS and Magister. I was told UI was not welcome to join it....<br>
<br>
We started assembling people to get him killed we had about 25 in zone when first SF members started appearing. They only had about 15-18 online, a force insufficient to kill such mob.<br>
<br>
20 Minutes later I saw MS people along with SF people zone into DN and 10 minutes later without any communication of any sort, even tho I tried talking to many people from both guilds, zoned out and attacked and killed the mob.<br>
<br>
It seemed that SF did not have enough people online and had to ask MS to help them to KS us...<br>
<br>
Respect is earned not given.<br>
<br>
Your guild respects very little in my opinion and you have very little or no control over the actions of your guild as a whole.<br>
<br>
I have talked to you about our other incidents where we got into a predicament, every time you told me you cannot decide anything for your guild. It takes about 4 hours for your guild to come to any consensus and if you have people in position and with the #'s for an encounter you never back down. You respect only force, unless I have the people there to kill it, talking to you is pointless, and ends up the same way everytime. SF killing mob UI leaving....<br>
<br>
This Friday i dont know the whole story, I arrived late, but i was there for the pull and the kill. Did you try talking to me about it? Did Mackentil refuse to talk to you?<br>

We(Magister) had just finished up CT and arrived in Kael for the next scheduled fight(Vindi/Statue).  We had 42 people in zone and found 12 SF and 16 UI. Since neither guild was anywhere near fighting anything with a capital letter name the plan was to go ahead and off vindi/statue and proceed onto tormax. However after a little communciation and the desire to avoid a giant flamefest the choice was made to go ahead and take out tormax and head over to yeli and then see if vindi/statue was still alive by that point.  This basically kinda fits what has been stated before.  Now one little tidbit though I remember is someone saying that UI and SF were joining together to take out vindi. I don't know where that came from though, I just remember it being stated.<br>
<br>
Granted I was dissappointed that we did pass on the statue(someone always seems to be killing him during our week), even though that is kinda selfish.  I am equally dissappointed in the events which further occurred. Especially if someone had told us that UI and SF were joining forces to take on vindi so they would have the appearances of a fight-ready raid.<br>

That is both ironic and moronic. <br>
<br>
We do have a working relationship with MS and hit ST together. We have both proven we can kill Zlandicar, Klandicar and Sontalak as individual guilds and partner up occaisionally on key mobs because it serves our joint needs.<br>
<br>
We do not think UI lacks leadership or that everyone in UI is evil. Read his post more carefully. I know it is long but it is very well written. Yenom's post is actually directed to the many UI members who did not like the way things went down and feel bad about it. <br>
<br>
I was sorry to witness the head butting at the Arena. I am older then many of my guildmates and perhaps more philosophical. I disdain conflict and really just want to have fun. I suggested we let you guys have Vindi because its one of the only Velious mobs you guys can kill. Yeah it was an ugly scene but big deal. We went and whacked Dozekar instead and finished up more ToV quests. /shrug<br>

<br>
As for that incident with Klandicar, what ever view point you wish to see on it, did we not work out a rotation afterwards?  Without you having killed the mob?  Things like that are much better worked out while not staring at the mob in question.  Also, how can you call that a KS when you did not have enough ready for Klandicar when SF and MS did.  I'm not flaming you for teaming up with Pendragon Society to kill the Vind and Statue on Friday, even though without them there your guild would not have been ready to steal the pull.  If United Independent plus Pendragon Society had set up faster and cleanly killed the Vindicator then we would have gone about our business somewhat flustered but understanding.<br>
<br>
Guilds getting together to acomplish goals is something to be aproved of no matter if it sets your personal goals back a little bit.  Any kind of communication, teamwork and server spirit building serves as a bastion against later misunderstanding and flaming.  We used to get all hot under the collar and upset with Midnight Sojourn regularly.  Now after working towards some similar goals together we find things ten times easier to work out.  Though before we were able to work together we had to establish some base respect between guilds.<br>
<br>
I rarely make binding agreements for my guild without everyone having discussed it before hand.  We are very democratic in that everyone has a voice and counts.  I've stated before and I'll state it again.  I have yet to receive a tell ever from United Independent untill after the situation has reached the point of no backing down for both guilds.  Also a deal doesn't always begin with 'UI gets this one you get the next one' when both guilds are all there fully assembled.  I could see going for that once but when it is consistantly the only option given then it is to Storm's Fury's detriment to consider such 'deals'.<br>
<br>
I didn't say United Independent has no leadership, obviously they do or they wouldn't exist.  I'm saying it is misguided and leaning to a totalitarian state of mind.  Or if that is not the case then currently it is laggard and cares little for what other guilds opinions are and does nothing to try to resolve issues before they arise.  By that I mean a day or two before, if not more.  If I had notice from anyone United Independent, who had never killed the statue, was going to be there we would have gone to kill Dozekar right off instead.  With your push to kill Dozekar the Cursed it was felt that would be your focus for the evening so as not to conflict we would go to the Statue.<br>
<br>
Mostly this series of posts is in an effort towards two goals.  To enlighten and invigor United Independent's members and leadership into assuming a more responsible role on the server.  And at the same time send out a message to other guilds, hell even some of my own we are not perfect, that sharing is to the betterment of the entire server, even if that means occasionally putting off a goal you hold.  If someone is doing anything on a regular basis that you would like to do ask them how it can be worked out to integrate you and your guild.<br>
<br>
Dracon, no one to my knowledge in Storm's Fury tried to mislead anyone in Magister that it was a joint raid.  I even talked to Koryo a bit about it.  I aprove of your guilds decision to leave the statue to others who are looking for some raid to have fun on when you have other options.  I have to say I aprove of the sharing Koryo, though quite blunt in the phrasing, decided upon.  Magister had many other options and decided they could easily go do some of those instead.<br>
<br>
Gilgamel, I don't usually play on sundays so I don't know what occured at Zlandicar.  If it is something that can lead to normalized relations between United Independent and Storm's Fury that is great and I applaud it.<br>
<br>
Thank you for your time and hoping we can work these issues out beforehand in the future.<br>

Since I was the officer there leading, I am going to respond too.<br>
<br>
Every encounter with SF has been about numbers with UI always loosing. I have stated many times that I would like to work things out between guilds so that we do not bump heads. I sent you several tells that night but you never answered them. Gilgamel was talking to you the entire evening also. When we had the numbers to kill the mob, I said that we were going to pull. I guess you got that tell. When we pulled you had 25 people and we had 38. If you were ready you could have pulled him. UI would have backed down and left like we have down countless times in the past. We cleared the path twice which takes 40 mins. You had plenty of time to pull if you were ready.<br>
<br>
We were having a race to the mob. We didn't train you. We didn't pull through you. UI could have been in the arena with 12 people all day keeping the mobs clear also. Camping in the arena doesn't claim vindi. <br>
<br>
I don't like my name and my guild's name slandered like this. Just a couple weeks ago we were heading into fear for some epic items. SF was wanting to do CT. I told SF that he wasn't up because we had killed him the week prior and he was due to pop till the next day. We worked out a deal to let SF have CT and draco if they were up since we got them last week. We go in and CT and draco weren't up. SF leaves. About an hour later CT pops and the zone respawns. Did UI try to hide that from SF? NO! I sent a tell to SF that CT spawned. They even CR'd us. I respected the deal we worked out even though they had already left. Yep UI has no ethics.<br>
<br>
I have been playing this game forever and reading this message board forever. Everyone knows how this game is played. In the beginning usually one guild dominates. Then another guild gets the numbers to compete. The top guild doesn't back down until the up and coming guild causes them to make deals to save everyone time and prevent leaving spawns open for another less powerful guilds to kill. MS did this to Da'Kor. SF did this to MS and Da'Kor/Magister. Now SF, MS, and Magister is getting the same treatment from UI, DG, and Affliction.<br>
<br>
For the last few months Magister, MS, and SF have had free reign over SoV and the rest of Norrath. They have formed agreements to work together to keep from bumping heads and to keep other people out. Now they have competition from UI, DG, and Affliction. Now these three guilds must fight for our shot at these mobs. They will not be handed to us on a platter.<br>
<br>
After the Klandicar incident that Kaane mentioned above, UI got into the K and Z rotation with Magister, MS, and SF. It lasted about month because DG started killing them and I think Affliction got a kill or two also. Instead of allowing them into the rotation, Zlandicar went FFA (Also partly due to Klandicar being upgraded). Once again to keep other guilds out. It is very difficult to compete with Magister, MS, and SF when they are raiding. UI accepts this. If UI wants Zlandicar, we have to have the raid force ready and beat everyone there. I think it has happened once.<br>
<br>
Now Magister and MS have an agreement worked out where they swap weeks in NTov. SF, UI, DG, and Affliction must compete with whoever isn't in NToV that week. Magister has already stated that it was their statue that week but decided not to pull it. Does everyone expect Magister or MS to just let one of these guilds just have the statue spawn? You are smoking crack if you answer yes. If a raid force is there and ready to go they won't touch them. However, if another guild is just gathering, they will pull on and rightly so. This is how the game is played. If UI had not of been there I guarantee that Magister would have pulled right over SF.<br>
<br>
Something else to consider. Magister and MS can kill multiple boss mobs in one night. They just don't go kill uber mob #1 and call it a night. They kill three or four a night, heck, maybe more. I think it is amazing that they can do this. It shows how organized and powerful they really are. What this causes though is very few mobs available for everyone else. When guilds get a shot, they aren't going to back down. Would UI support rotations on uber mobs? Of course. We wouldn't have to bust our ass to get them. Would Magister and MS allow SF and UI into the rotation? HELL NO, because they don't have to. They only will do it when they get serious competition.<br>
<br>
I am not bitter about the way the game is played. I accept that the more powerful guilds make the rules. I accept that the more powerful guilds will dominate and UI has to bust our ass to get the leftovers. I do not accept being flamed for beating another guild to a mob. I do not accept being insulted for playing the game by the rules that have existed on this server for a very very very long time.<br>
<br>
If SF wants to work out some sort of rotation on mobs like we have in the past, contact us. I doubt that you will because most of the time you can beat us. Why make a rotation when their is no competition? I am sorry that you must take this issue to the public message boards. We have kept quiet with all the shit you have done to us. Go ahead and get everyone on the trash UI bandwagon. Hopefully everyone can see what it going on here.<br>

Unfortunately, the lack of respect/communication is not something that's just between the top guilds.  In fact, some of the larger guilds think nothing of it, or find it rather amusing, if they can jump onto a mob or a Plane for example, faster than even the pick up raids.  <br>
<br>
Most recently, this occured over the weekend when I was in attendance for a pick up raid, which was just forming groups.  People were in the zone, just making sure they were in groups.  While groups were being formed, we were informed that one of the larger guilds had jumped over us and gone in.  I'd heard that they had been planning their raid for a few weeks and that's all fine and dandy.  However, myself and several other people on the raid noticed their members in the zone, while we were forming so you can't tell me that they didn't know and they most certainly did not communicate.  They merely entered the zone from another area, instead of the standard.  Like I said, they were most likely planning to go play in the same area and it's a first come, first serve deal.  However, the lack of communication and the outright disregard for anyone else's plans is ridiculous.  Our time is no more or no less valuable than anyone elses, yet people don't have the simple respect.<br>
<br>
Yes, this is &quot;just a game&quot;.  However, there are real people playing this game and a lot of these people rearrange schedules or wake up at a certain hour just to do certain things.  Sagemon, Vetinari and myself run pick up raids, as most people are aware, and we always try to respect communication and if someone else is going where we want to.  We have bowed out of raiding situations to allow others to proceed and we have had the same courtesy extended to us.  <br>
<br>
It's a shame however, that there are some large guilds with the mentality that just because they can dominate, they will, and they don't care.   <p>Tormentcia

Then it's all downhill from there.  This is all the same crap that happened when you got in your first pickup group and were all set to take Derv 3 in NRo.  Then while your your cleric was lost trying to find the place (because people are dumb fucks and can't figure out how to use /loc) some other group broke the camp.  Then it's KSing and training for everyone.<br>
<br>
Speaking as an SF member, it would be naive for any of us to claim that we don't share in a large portion of the blame in these conflicts.  It's human nature to have all the &quot;fuck them&quot; chatter going on.  Which then leads to the big dick contest.  (Which I always win.  People often think I had a horse cock surgically grafted to my pelvis.  But it's natural.  It's a mixed blessing though.  Most smallish asian girls get scared and run off. And I have a thing for asian girls.  It makes me sad sometimes.)<br>
<br>
Here's a simple recommendation:  the minute you see this crap begining to take shape between guilds, pick a single spokesperson and ask the other guild to pick one as well.  Let those two hash it out.  Then at least everyone is on the same page and we can avoid the &quot;he said, she said&quot; bullshit.  I think even in the worst of times most guilds can muster up at least one rational person to speak for the group.<br>
<br>
Even an agreement that it's a race or a KS contest is an agreement.  And that's a solid place to have continued discussions from.  &quot;Jabober demanded that we race rather than roll for it.  And you guys lost.&quot;  That's infinitely better than a bunch of accusations based on what somebody heard somebody else say they saw somebody talking about.  You don't get pissed if you lose a race. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uvindes.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Vindes</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#E9D756>(9/24/01 2:52:46 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.geocities.com/vincent_dees/Vindes.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ethics in Everquest</span><hr size=1> Oops.

Despite everyone's pride in the fact that this is a blue server, there are ways.  <br>
<br>
Really though, the people at fault here are the designers of Everquest.  If you have enough people do to something, why should you have to wait sometimes WEEKS to do it.  It's an inherent flaw in the game design, and could easily be solved by simply making spawns happen on a more often, regular basis.  A side benefit of this would be the disappearance of most of the beggars on one end of the spectrum, and the ebayers on the other end.  <br>
<br>
Otherwise you get competition, and competition awards the most ruthless hard core competitors.  Surprisingly, ruthless, hardcore competitors do exist on the blue servers, even though sometimes, I think some of these people refuse to admit it to themselves.  One of the most particularly vicious Shriners took quite a while to come out of the PK Closet, but when he did it was like a serial killer got set loose.<br>
<br>
Sportsmanship could solve this problem, but with the serious lack of penalties for unsportsmanlike conduct, combined with a really immature player base(face it, every internet game player base is immature), it's not a likely solution.<br>
<br>
The only real way would be to establish a governing body that determined the spawn rotations of every significant spawn.  This worked surprisingly well for Venril Sathir for a long time and continued to work as long as non guilded forces were unable to kill him.  Once a pickup raid could do it, problems arose.<br>
<br>
In short, you are all screwed!<br>
