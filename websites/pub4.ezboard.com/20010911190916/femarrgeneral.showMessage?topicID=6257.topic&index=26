<br>
Just a thought though.    Obviously rotation has a lot of flaws and a lot of guilds have jumped ahead, not known when their rotation is, etc.  If we don't leave an opening.. Every Uggh.. 15 guilds or so? for the &quot;pick-up&quot; raid, what would stop some raid leader of attempting to organize one every 3 days.   Giving them a spot tries to get them to follow the same rules with everyone else.   If not, we might just end up with more people trying to kill him all the time with no organization and Fitz will have to go even longer without his stick.  <br>

However, they need to be able to hold their spot in the rotation or the whole thing goes down the tubes.  VS is something I see as being the next Naggy/Vox.  The dragon leaders have outgrown them and now want something else that's relatively easy (compared to Planes and whatnot) that they can schedule and lead.  Adding a pick up to the rotation basically is because of that ..the dragon leaders need something they can handle, or think they can handle that spawns at a specific time on a specific date.  Will there be a lot of bitching when they get KS'd in the rotation?  Yep, no doubt about it.  Would I ever want to take one of my pick up raids to VS?  Not really.  It's not worth the headache.<br>
<br>
This is all coming from a bottle neck at the end game.  There are a bunch of people passing 50 every day and they will cap out eventually at 60.  The high level guilds just aren't recruiting every class because a lot of them are full .. so the smaller guilds basically band together in pick up raids, as their only shot at doing something like this.  <br>
<br>
It makes sense why it is happening but like I said, this is really just going to turn into the next Naggy/Vox dragon raids, but only this time it will be VS.   <p>Tormentcia

Not from me we have one wizard in guild thinking about his epic but he plays 3 characters and cant decide which is his main. <br>

Do I want the deepwater armor yes. <br>
Does Siilverain want the Elder armor yes. <br>

Torm, Vet, and I prefer to run raids that last a few hours and provide a lot of fun and loot for the whole group.  A VS raid is just a rifle shot at one mob, sort of like a Naggy or Vox raid.  And frankly, the loot off of VS just isn't that great.<br>
<br>
I would expect the VS pickup raids to be led by the dragon raid people, who will use the same sort of &quot;paint by numbers&quot; approach that works so well with Naggy and Vox.  The same will probably be true for the Kunark dragons at some point.<br>
<br>
On the larger subject, I've been saying for several weeks that the rotation was dead.  I know there are a lot of people who don't want to hear that, but it's true.  VS is no longer an uber level mob.  Far from it.  There are too many groups on this server who can kill VS for the old rotation system to survive.<br>
<br>
It sucks that an epic piece drops off VS, just as it sucks that epic pieces drop in Fear and Hate.  Because of that, the top guilds are going to keep raiding VS, Fear, and Hate even though those sorts of raids are really beneath them.  (I'm not including Inny and CT raids here -- those are a different ballgame.)  This is going to be a continuing source of friction between the smaller guilds and independents, on the one hand, and the top guilds, on the other hand.  That could be a bigger problem in the long run than the loss of the outdated rotation system for VS. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/udrazhkahn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Drazhkahn</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_redspot.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 228<br> <font color=#E9D756>(8/10/01 12:56:19 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Pick up slot</span><hr size=1> My personal opinion on the matter, is that there are alot more challenging and rewarding things to do than to dick around in Karnor's Castle just to kill one mob, just because you can. I feel sorry for all the wizards out there that have to kill him for a damn epic piece, kinda like decrepit hides for shadowknights but that's another topic...<br>
<br>
VS isn't all that hard, infact, I'm sure he can (and probably has) been killed by 12 people or less. It's just getting the strategy down and then after that, it's pretty much old hat.<br>
<br>
If a guild has a wizard or wizards that need pieces, then sure, keep on knocking VS down, but if you're killing him just because you can, at least invite a wizard on the off chance that a staff piece might drop.<br>

Pick-ups. Well, eventually everyone knew this was going to happen. Next it'll be Trak, then the lemming rush into WW and beyond. <br>

<br>
VS is not entirely different, imo, from Nagafen and Vox...<br>
1. He has a basic strategy that can be mastered<br>
2. He isn't hard if you do what you are supposed to do<br>
3. He doesn't have a ton of hps nor *should* he do much mele damage<br>
4. Pick up groups can and will slay him<br>
<br>
Lets face it, he is probably the next hardest mob after the 2 pussay Dragons of Antonica.<br>

The big attraction will be the sense of accomplishment that comes from taking down a tough mob like VS.<br>
<br>
Once everyone has killed VS a couple times, the thrill factor will vanish.  VS will then be killed primarily by paint-by-numbers raids that are farming the leg armor.<br>

<br>
Your assumption about most of the high caliber players being in guilds that kill Kunark dragons is probably true right now, but its changing fast.  However, your second assumption -- that those players wouldn't want to go on a pickup run -- is dubious.  Some of the big guilds don't really raid that often, and some of the high level members of those guilds are often scouting around for a pickup raid.<br>
<br>
I suspect that someone could put together a successful pickup raid for one of the Kunark dragons right now, but it would be very hard to assemble all of the right people.  As time goes by, it will get easier.  Once again, for the record I have no intention of trying to put together that sort of raid.<br>

<br>
The drops in PoG are much better than anything that drops off of VS.  However, the drop rates in PoG are low, the respawn times are long, and the faction problems exclude a lot of people.  We will keep going to PoG because a lot of people in our group like it, but frankly I find PoG boring and unchallenging. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/udreadwolfff.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dreadwolfff</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 22<br> <font color=#E9D756>(8/11/01 6:55:26 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Pick up slot</span><hr size=1> Adding a pick up slot to the rotation is only going to make it free for all . <br>
