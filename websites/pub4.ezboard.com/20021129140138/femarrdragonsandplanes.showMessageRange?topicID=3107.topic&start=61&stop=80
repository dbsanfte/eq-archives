Anyway, we've changed the discussion to who should pay for the costs of pollution cleanups.  That's the real question.

Add to that responsibilities around the home, taking care of one's family, and any random additional responsibilities one might have, and you see that the average person really doesn't have a shitload of spare time.  Nor does he/she have the education necessary to assume the sort of consumer responsibilities we're talking about here.  To expect those things is just silly, it could never work.  I understand that there are a lot of idealists posting here, and that some of the ideas put forth would work in an ideal world... hell, in an ideal world I'd probably vote for a conservative.  This isn't an ideal world, though.  Applying ideas that are based on idealistic principles are in reality often futile, and I'd rather go with policies that actually work and bring the greatest possible benefit to society than policies that seem to work in an abstract sense but fall short in the real world. <p>Erevan MacQuaide, cleric of Nimue <BR>

This will only aid the irresponsible corporations and place burden on the common man. I think the justification Bush will be relying on however to get this and most of his environmental rape packages through is &quot;look Axis of Evil&quot;<br>
<br>
He is pushing for his new volutary emissions reduction program. The thing is though, back in 1992, President George Herbert Walker Bush signed an agreement from the Rio Earth Summit that called for voluntary greenhouse gas reductions. Yet emissions increased, and so a few years later civilized nations called for a firmer approach. That resulted in the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, which last year was embraced by over 160 nations -- excluding the world's biggest polluter, the United States. The younger Bush is merely re-packaging what failed in 1992. <br>
<br>
What's better he invented a new fuzzy math to prove this time that it will work. It says greenhouse gasses can increase at a portion of the economic growth. May sound good until you realize that energy useage increases at a much lower percentage than economic growth. <br>
<br>
Bush has his environmental plans written by industry for the love of god. What should we expect. It's like letting the guys with sports cars write the moving violations laws. <br>
<br>
Sagemon, I carpool to work. I make less than the average American, therefore the income tax is a relatively bigger burden on myself, so by transferring the payments to taxpayers it will increase the burden on the lower levels of the tax bracket while decreasing the burden on the factories, who may have no tax burden soon, according to Bush's plans. Is it easier to right and enforce tax breaks for enivironmentally friendly companies or for environmentally friendly individuals. Factories already get tax breaks for money they spend on safety measures, so all this plan does is let those who don't choose to spend on safety off the hook and which, in a competitive capitallistic society, will encourage companies to NOT take safety precautions as it will affect there bottom line. As we know the company who can produce the most goods at the lowest price is the one at the greatest advantage in our economic system. <br>

<br>
Kudos to Sage for at least getting Chi to admit that he was totally misphrasing the issue and that it really came down to regular taxes or other companies paying for unfunded cleanups.  Chi you may as well have said, &quot;Yeah, ok, I was lying about it just like the rest of the liberals do, the real issues is that I wanna make sure I don't have to pay for anything....&quot;<br>
<br>
Zariel if you made $4,000 last year then you paid NO taxes at all....so you aren't paying for anything anyway.  But your whole argument boils down to your &quot;these companies make billions of dollars per year and they can afford it more than I can&quot; statement.  <br>

Oh, and I do think it is ok to pour sludge in the ocean.  How much is ok depends on what's in the sludge.  Only a complete environmental wacko would make such a blanket statement. <p>Cenelron Tank'n'Puller <BR>

Money that companies make is taxed as income, then what's left as profit is given out to the people who own the stock, and it is taxed again as income.  A &quot;tax cut&quot; for corporations is just a reduction in the double taxation on the investors.<br>
<br>
Corporations are just pools of people's money working to produce something and give people jobs.  A corporation is not a person, it is a tool.  And if you have the forsight to actually save any money in a retirement account then likely your money is in some corporation.<br>

A corporation is an entity. An entity that can hire lobbyist and usually is controlled by 10 or fewer people who may control other corporations. The average persons 7 shares in IBM doesn't make him truly an owner of IBM, no more than the fly whacking against my window is my pet. <br>
<br>
I have a crystal clear idea how corporations work, that is why I put money in the bank or in bonds because I refuse to fund my own raping. It's not class envy. I could give up my job go back to college for free and get a degree in anything and be hauling in 6 or 7 figures. I instead focus on my arts, something I feel cannot be taught or monetarily valued. <br>
<br>
Interesting you should try to point out the old conservative gripe about double taxation, well over 20% of my income goes to taxes, whereas a millionaire brokers is taxed fifty percent. Now the vast majority of the rest of my income is going into living expenses which is taxed again via local sales taxes. Whereas the minority of a millionaire's funds pay for living expenses, therefore a greater percentage of my money is going into the tax pool, so excuse me if I don't feel sorry because Ken Lay couldn't handle the remaining billions of dollars the government didn't tax. <br>
<br>
If Zariel made $4,000 last year, the vast majority probably was taxed, just not at the income tax level. I am betting he still paid gas tax, sales tax, maybe cigarette tax, as well as others. Speaking of the those, why do we have a cigarette tax or a gas tax? So the people who use the stuff the government deemed costly end up paying for it. Why do I pay more for car insurance than a woman my age with a different car? Because people who fit my description are what cost the insurance company the most in payouts. Corporations who produce toxins are what cost us the money in clean up so I see no problem in making them the party to pay. Do you think anyone is forcing people to invest in Monsanto, or even forcing Monsanto to produce substances nature cannot breakdown? They make a choice to do so, just as I make the choice to smoke. I am willing to pay the tax on that.<br>
<br>
Conservatives always try to make us believe it is taxes that bankrupt corporations, while the rest of us try to figure out how to keep a checkbook balanced with a paycheck half the size of our bills. Taxes have never, <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> NEVER</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->, bankrupted a corporation. The S&amp;L, Enron, all of them went under because of poor investments, and self serving management. Corporations don't exist to give jobs no more than a plantation existed to give black people a place to live. Its not like the heads hire us out of generousity. They hire us to make money, plain and simple. Why do you think corporations lay off after record profits? Because they know we cannot survive on unemployment and will look for another job than they can rehire at starting wage.  <br>
<br>
I have no problem paying for the government, I just think the rich should be forced to pay their fair share. They can afford the lawyers to hunt for the loopholes, I cannot. So it is our jobs as the ones stuck with the burden of taxes to watch those who dance upon the system they have used, abused and corrupted alll the way to the top. <br>

Lets just take everything away from the people who suceed and give it to you.  That doesn't sound fair, does it?  So lets make it sound nicer and instead come up with trillions of dollars worth of social services and make everyone except you pay for it.  Does that sound fairer?<br>
<br>
Jobs are the RESULT of people trying to make money, morons.  You think corporations exist just to pollute and lobby?  No, they make money for investors.  If they did not, then there would be no corporations and no commerce.  <br>
<br>
Then you'd have no McDonalds where you can go spend an hour's wages on lunch.  Poor you, you starve.  What?  You'll make your own sandwhich?  So who's gonna make the bread?  Wonder isn't in business anymore because the investors decided to bury their money in mason jars in the back yard since they can't make money investing in stocks (otherwise known as investing in companies).<br>
<br>
Luckily the rich people are smart enough to use their money to influence people who make decisions into not going along with people like you, Ritt.  <br>
<br>
Yayyyyyyyy, lobbyists!  More power to the special interests!  Less power to those who say they chose to make less money because their low paying work is more fulfilling then bitch about not having enough money and how its not fair that they have to pay for something when other people make more money!<br>
<br>
I must say, I do admire the honesty I see here.  I remember the day when liberals weren't so open about the fact that all they're trying to do is keep from having to pay for anything themselves (especially while saying that they are taking lower paying jobs on purpose).  But you guys come right out and say it.  Good for you!<br>
<br>
Hmmmm, maybe we should just make the people that chose to make money pay for everything.....I think I'm gonna decide to sit on my ass and let others pay for everything too.  I think that sitting on your ass cannot be taught or monitarily valued, so I'm doing it for a good reason.   <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>Cenelron Tank'n'Puller <BR>

<br>
The companies that pollute should be held responsible, but sometimes that is not possible.  So yeah, if the responsible parties can't be held liable then I think general tax dollars should be used for the cleanup, but make the standard of &quot;clean&quot; more reasonable.<br>
<br>
Those of you who think it is common place to just bankrupt and start again are clueless.  That is not feasible in most cases and is certainly not standard operating proceedure for corporations despite what these anti-capitalism morons tell you. <p>Cenelron Tank'n'Puller <BR>

The post is on the R&amp;F board because no matter where I start a post, it ends up here. So it saves time just putting it here.<br>
<br>
<br>
Ceneiron:<br>
<br>
So your solution is to create 'acceptable' levels of pollution and 'IF' the site cant be cleaned then stick it to the taxpayers, AND I mean the TAXPAYERS, not the people who avoid paying taxes, the people who CANT avoid paying taxes.<br>
<br>
Tell you what, YOU can go live on an 'acceptable' site. You can watch your baby daugther die of kidney failure. Because the 'acceptable' level happened to be set<br>
to high. But I guess that is ok because its just the 'lower classes' that suffer?<br>
<br>
I think that the laws should be altered so that executive officers of companies who pollute have a personal liability for the decisions they make as directors of the company. That would mean that they would lose all that cash they stashed.<br>
<br>
Well Ceneiron, so far the USA still has universal franchise. That means that people<br>
like you are way outnumbered. It is just a matter of information reaching them.<br>

Meaning that the owners of the company are not responsible for all of the business debts the company aquires.  Just think about it, all the accidents and lawsuits that go on today, if corporations has unlimited liability the economy would be in ruins.  People would be suing left and right and companies would either a) be scared to start for fear of being sued out of business or b) run out of money from settling out of court, being that they have unlimited liability.  A corporation was simply not designed to be run like that.  If the company was a sole proprietorship it would be much different.<br>
<br>
If you want to go in a loop, the company produces something that the consumers want, and consume, and therefore, it is the consumers that are &quot;destroying&quot; the environment.  If you don't like the way a company conducts business in a free enterprise system, you are free to not purchase your goods and services from that particular company. <p><BR><BR><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=20510">
