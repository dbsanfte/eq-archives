<br>
anyway, just a couple of points.  you asked vendrix in your reply to him if he read my post.  well, words being what they are, my post could be read and intertwined into his posts as support.  i simply made it clear that wasn't my intention.<br>
<br>
for example:<br>
i answered a bunch of questions (i've read them admit to the &quot;crimes&quot; before, but it seems you haven't) in the affirmative.  right after that paragraph, you could insert vendrix's reply to you from earlier saying that if there were legitemate and serious (raping, pillaging, sacrificing unborn children) complaints against dakor, they would have issues with the members in question, but they simply don't care about the &quot;crimes&quot; you take so seriously that they would persecute people they have long standing friendships with over them.  follow that paragraph with the one from my post in which i clearly state the flip side of dakor.  while they (we) might answer yes to those questions, they can also answer with positive attributes as well.  meaning they are human, with good and bad qualities.<br>
<br>
words are funny that way, depends on how you want to interpret what you've read.<br>

Dropped parnell? Umm...ya i guess if you look at it that way i did. Parnell is like a brother to me and just like siblings at times they need some space to do there own thing. Does that mean they still dont care for each other? Does that mean they wouldnt be there if the other truely needed them? True friends are those that know they are family parnell knows he is a member of my family.<br>
<br>
On another side note: PARNELL YOU SUCK!! YOU SUCK SUCK SUCK!! I HOPE A DRAGON EATS YOU! FUCKING WOOD ELF SOB AND YOUR POINTY EARS!!<br>

<br>
See if a player wishes to be an A*****e and he has the b***s to admit<br>
it in public(like Zolen) then I might actually admire that player for being honest.<br>
Kuzic comes close at times but he just cant quite come out of the closet.<br>
<br>
But you see for some reason this particular guild had a big problem with saying<br>
'Yeah we ran those losers out and took the zone' Until recently in any case.<br>
Only in the past two months did they apparently simply get tired of denial or more<br>
likely forgot which denial they had used in the past. They could say all this in<br>
guild chat of course but never in public.<br>
<br>
I guess they were afraid of what that would make them look like.<br>
Now if they HAD bothered to be brave and honest, then I would have been forced<br>
to try a new tack. But that never happened. Now that EQ is dying well its way too<br>
late for redemption. But the bottom line is this. At least one member of this guild DOES have a conscience. My words do pain him. He may curse my name and the day we met, but he will never deny the truth. That one person is my audience.<br>

Well the story I heard was that Rannd had been hung out to dry on PoF and DK took its sweet time CR'ing him. Ok so maybe that is not the case. Still when you all left DK suffered a blow. You are all 'real' players. Any guild that loses you guys<br>

In the last 3 months Tuan there have been 6 posts that could be interpeted<br>

People who play monks are not by nature deeply spiritual beings, bent on the service of truth and the balance. Infact, on the whole, I would say punk-ass kids with Tekken fixations are probably more numerous than your zen types. Not to say that that is true of all monks, because, well you can't judge people based on the class they play. <br>
<br>
Kanya made a fine point about the rest of the UBERs, although I don't agree with the 'Verant made them do it' stance. I'll tell you something about a lot of these amazing people who are in post Da`kor guilds, people who you think are so damn wonderful. A hell of a lot of them used to hold Da`kor as their own personal Satan. Infact, many of them wanted no part in the way that Da`kor played the game. Then one day, they did! Bang, quick whiff of the loot, and millions of baby froglocks got trampled under foot. In part, Verant responded to what the players wanted, with the upper end of the game, but twisted it into this thing called uber. You will recall (perhaps) that there was no uber before Kunark. So when I come to these boards and read arguments between uber guilds, by people who once despised power-gaming, when I see these self same people stabbing their former friends in the back because they are in a different uber guild to them, just to further an argument over some bullshit spawn or piece of loot, it makes me sick. <br>
<br>
Da`kor might have been a lot of things, but they weren't hypocrites. They played the game how they wanted to, rather than (like the uber guilds) how Verant wanted them to. What offends you so much about them, over all the rest of these swine? It can't really be them pushing their weight around, because everyone else does it. It can't really be dominating spawn sites, because everybody does it. It can't really be abusing other guilds, because... well you get the idea. So what makes them different? What really irks you? Is it that they did it first, and that they did it with a little bit of fucking finesse? <br>
<br>
Perhaps it is merely because you are not a member of Da`kor. Or perhaps you dropped too much acid in the sixties. One thing I'm certain of, if there is a so called &quot;dark side&quot; to this game, it is the ubers, and the high-end, which you are part of. So, perhaps you need to make this shit up to justify your own position in this bullshit game world. <p><font color="#c2cafc" size=1 face="arial">

First my account is locked. I am part of nothing. Verant owes me 280$<br>
That makes me real mad.<br>
When I DO play I think you have no idea how I play. Only when I get in the face<br>
of some jerk throwing his weight around, it is only then that you see 'my' dark side.<br>
After all the posts that I have made and all the flames that DK has replied in<br>
you STILL dont see the bottom line?<br>
It is simple. There was a faction fight. I lost. Now do you understand?<br>
It is political. Now most people on EM that lose, create a new char and try to live it down. I call them cowards. The reason bullies win is because they go unchallenged. Well after more than two years I think this bully has been challenged.<br>
<br>
You may say Khir that that doesnt matter. I say it depends on what you evaluate.<br>
You cannot possibly know what DaKor may have been like if I had simply vanished.<br>
I cant possibly say either. I do know that it was bad enough. A guild admits<br>
that it walked into lowerguk and simply camped the entire level. That is an arrogance beyond acceptance. It DEMANDS confrontation. However none occurs.<br>
I think you are right, greed and avarice are the prime movers on EQ.<br>
Get what you can at all costs. We can sort out the moral expense later.<br>
I dont play that way. Even my worst enemies (take your pick) would not say I do.<br>
But no punk half my age will run me out. That will never happen.<br>
<br>
However bad management may win where bad players cannot.<br>
It is hard to fight Verant when they make the rules.<br>

<br>
Oh my, they camped lower guk when there was hardly anyone else there! And they had the spawns beacuse they could handle it and they were there first, wow they just are terrible aren't they?<br>
<br>
I used to camp magi/lord by myself to level up between 50 and 60, I guess I am a terrible person too because I had the resources/skill whatever you want to call it to camp those 2 spawns by myself.<br>
<br>
Get over yourself Chiteng, you only interpret events how you want to make them seem like some prime source of evil; then you praise yourself in your self crusade to stop them.  It's all in your mind.<br>

Not sure you really want an answer but no. If you can do it solo, more power to you. However....if you hold a camp when someone else could actually USE<br>
the robe, simply out of greed let us say, then you are unpleasant.<br>
<br>
I suppose I could solo sentinal, never actually tried. But if I did it every day for<br>
20/7 and didnt let anyone else in, that would be disgusting.<br>

<br>
Again you play the role of finding evil in something when it is not really there.  So it's greedy for me to hold a camp when it is one of the only place I could get good solo exp? Just because an item happens to drop that someone else wants I should just leave?  And if I don't I'm &quot;unpleasent&quot;? (btw, just so you know, at times I would give up the camp to someone who wanted to camp a robe, but that was definitly not something I should have had to do)<br>
<br>
This is completely analogous to how you view Da`Kor camping lower guk, and how you view everything.  So they went in with a group and got as much exp as they wanted because there was virtually no one else there.  Then someone else comes along (you i assume) and since there is nothing open, they are just prime evil becuase you couldn't get exp there since you weren't there first.<br>
<br>
Don't you see this Chiteng?  When you look at situations logically and not on the side of someone on a crusade against invisible evil you will see that this is all in your mind.<br>
