<br>
So, if it was a mistake, and the looter admits it to the GM, the rightful owner should get it back, not sure if its too late now tho..<br>

Well before you guys go on to do that , think twice ... This guild is not responsible for cydril's actions , nor anybody else's . One bad apple does not spoil the bunch .. And so forth my guild has nothing at all to do with this. We have discussed this matter between the guild and is there forth nobodies business but KoDM members . I was not at the scene to declare whether or not he was innocent or guilty and neither were you or half the ppl that has posted here. I went by what i was told by the raid leader and he appeared to have believed cydril. So before anybody goes on to spam or give my guild a bad reputation keep that in mind ... And for you renwell if your brother is so mad about this shouldnt he be posting here and not you ?? Just a thought ... And if your brother was not happy about this situation maybe he should of spoken up Like any other normal person would have done.. I know 98% of Eq players would have let you know they werent' happy yet ... And maybe your brother should have done so to fix this problem to his exspectations.. Thank you and have a good day renwell , I'm sure i'll be hearing from you again soon =) And believe me I look forward to this conversation ...<br>

Please Insert Foot in Mouth Here ====&gt;  &lt</span><hr size=1> Sorry, I haven't visited scammers R us in a few so I'll take a second to answer your questions Allaynna.<br>
<br>
I asked that question for a few reasons.  First off, many times bird of a feather flock together.  Is this behavior acceptable in your guild?  You say <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Why ?? Is it because you want to talk smack about my guild ?? Well before you guys go on to do that , think twice ...<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->  If this kind of thing doesn't raise an eyebrow in your guild.. we dont have to talk smack.. the actions speak for themselves.<br>
<br>
Now, the main reason I asked what guild he was a member of is so that the person that got screwed out of their loot by your reject could talk to his guild leaders and perhaps they could convince their member to take the proper action.  After your post here, I doubt that would accomplish much.<br>
<br>
Now for: <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> This guild is not responsible for cydril's actions , nor anybody else's . One bad apple does not spoil the bunch .. And so forth my guild has nothing at all to do with this. We have discussed this matter between the guild and is there forth nobodies business but KoDM members . <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> WRONG!!! He wears your guildtag?  Guess what cool breeze, he does represent you.  You're his proud leader?  Be prepared to take responsibility for his actions while wearing your tag.  If you dont want that, I suggest you be more selective about who you let join your guild.  As far as it being no one but KoDM's business, it wasn't a KoDM member who lost an epic drop due to your ninja looter was it?  Your member should never have been near the corpse and he surely didn't ACCIDENTALLY loot his epic piece.<br>
<br>
Now for:<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> And for you renwell if your brother is so mad about this shouldnt he be posting here and not you ?? Just a thought ... And if your brother was not happy about this situation maybe he should of spoken up Like any other normal person would have done.. I know 98% of Eq players would have let you know they werent' happy yet ... And maybe your brother should have done so to fix this problem to his exspectations..<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> Wrong attitude again my friend.  YOUR guild member did wrong.  Getting an attitude like this with the people who were wronged shows me that perhaps it was good that I asked for his guild name.  If the attitude of your followers are the same as the leadership, I might do well to avoid them.  What shocks me is that neither you NOR Cydril offered up an apology here.  If you plan on representing your guild, I'd suggest you learn a sense of decorum.  <br>
<br>
As far as the raid leader, Logical is an awesome guy who did the best he could with a bad situation.  You think he found this acceptable?  It was the best HE could manage with a nasty situation.  HOWEVER, your guy could step up and do as suggested here and lay the story to GMs and get things straightened out.  Possibly not now because of the time period that has passed, but he should have done it then. <p><a href="http://members.aol.com/wvvetteman/images/dalonhorse1.jpg" target="_blank">

Please Insert Foot in Mouth Here ====&gt;  &lt</span><hr size=1> Allaynna, after making my post here, I decided to check out your guild before making a final decision on them.  To my surprise, I found you well spoken and ultra polite on your own guild board.  Based on what I found from perusing your site, I re-evaluated my view of your guild in general.  My only guess as to why you changed so much coming here is you felt your guild was being attacked and came to your friend's defense.  Unfortunately, in this situation, your guild member was simply wrong.  He has no defense.  I also found this on your board <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> 6) Ninja looting not allowed or any form of scam. First time you are caught you will be removed from Guild.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->  If you post rules such as this, they should be followed.  That they are a high level about to be epicced shouldn't factor in.<br>
<br>
IMHO, as leader of your guild, you would have served them much better by coming here, offering a sincere apology to those affected, doing your best to rectify the situation (best chance for this has been laid out in this thread already), and doing your best to insure your guild name isn't further smeared by it happening again.<br>

Nice detective work, Dalamarn.<br>
<br>
Anyone wanna lay bets as to whether Allaynna has the courage as leader to actually enforce her guild's most draconian rules?  The majority of guilds I've been members of in the past have NOT had the balls to enforce a rule like this, especially if it could cost them a power player. <p><BR>

Please Insert Foot in Mouth Here ====&gt;  &lt</span><hr size=1> I was personally on the raid that this was ninja looted. I was not in anyway in charge, or affiliated with the leaders, but here are is my perspective:<br>
<br>
PC and some Affliction members were called in to help out a poorly lead fear raid (wipeout) we had already been there for atleast 7 hours, before PC came in. They came in in charge, Logical was the leader if I remember correctly. Some Affliction people came for the CR, but left shortly afterwards when everyone was set.<br>
<br>
The group of PCs, stayed and took over leadership of the raid. (And a great job they did I might add) We moved along the wall, quickly clearing the way. We managed to set up a camp, and prepared to pull Fright. <br>
<br>
We pulled him once, and wiped when Kogur got killed. <br>
<br>
We pulled him again, and succeded. (Let me also mention, Cydril was NOT in anyway affiliated with this raid in the beginning or in the recovery process.)<br>
<br>
Fright died, and a warrior in our raid won the Ball of Everliving Golem. The next thing I hear is one of the raid leaders shouting &quot;Oh You did NOT!&quot; or something of the like, =P<br>
<br>
Apparently someone had looted the ball of golem. This person was pointed out as Cydril, who apparently just happened to be in PoF for a stroll. *shrugs* Why the hell would you wander in to PoF? (Being a non-iksar monk)<br>
<br>
Allegedly Cydril claimed it was an accident. As you know, a little &quot;No drop confirmation box&quot; appears when you attempt to loot a no drop item. Cydril claimed he was just &quot;looking&quot; and that he never intended to loot the corpse. Apparently it was cleared up and the warrior that won the roll was given Cydril's Red Dragonscale in return. (I know this is not an even trade, but apparently the winner found it to be acceptable).<br>
<br>
That's what happened, as far as I know the raid leaders never brought this to a GM's attention, and assumed it was an accident.<br>
<br>
What ever you want to believe is your own business, personally I don't think it was an accident, but that's my opinion. I tried to state an unbiased explanation of what I thought happened. . . there ya go. <p><center><img src="http://www.crosswinds.net/~ofthesword/sig1.txt"><br><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=180294" target="_blank">Helius Wallace</a><br>

I logged on one day to find everything gone from my character (down to last cp).  They told me I died and my corpse sat there for a week and rotted.  Only problem with this is that I played the day AFTER they said I died, and I promise you I wasn't running around soloing naked.  /shrug  I know trades are trackable, but I think sometimes they give the answer that is easiet for them to come up with.  It probably depends on which GM you get.  I got Kaichaiki so I was told &quot;too bad so sad&quot; in not so many words.   <p><a href="http://members.aol.com/wvvetteman/images/dalonhorse1.jpg" target="_blank">
