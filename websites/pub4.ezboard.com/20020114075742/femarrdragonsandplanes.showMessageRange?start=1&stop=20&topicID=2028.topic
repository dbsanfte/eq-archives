The point of this post is to get a few facts across as I see them.  I am not intending this as a flame, however I'm sure it will degenerate into one, so I am posting it here. I also have quite a large number of friends in your guild, and despite(and perhaps via) them I have came to a couple of conclusions.  Feel free to flame my guild as you like, or me in particular, but you will not catch me making a discourteous or spiteful action ingame, and I think most people would agree with me that, although we have some supposedly shady characters, the actions of my guild since we reformed have been nothing but positive.   I think that is why we are growing, not fast, but at a steady pace, with a good influx of quality people. It is also why I think while other guilds will deteriorate, we will continue to grow and be a group of friends.  On to the subject matter.<br>
<br>
#1 Magister as a guild(that statement is important) has very little regard for other people ingame.  I know specific people in Magister are very kind and polite. I'm not directing this toward them. I do however feel Magister as a whole could give a rats ass about anyone else on the server.  This is not the same as Affliction claiming to be the bad guys, Magister really does not care.  There is no doubt in my mind that any other guild on the server in your situation would not have taken the action you did while UI was buffing for VS. Anyone care to argue this point?  <br>
<br>
#2 It is widely percieved by everyone except new Magister members that Magister isn't close to the same guild Da`kor was. Da`kor, to state a fact, was uber. They were one of the top 4 guilds in the game.  I had my problems with them, as I'm sure everyone did, but they were one of the best. Magister.... is not.  The old Da`kor members know it.  Thats why they removed their guildname when some people they felt didn't deserve it were invited.  Some of the new Magister, however, feel they are now uber, and are not opposed to flaunting it by disregarding everyone else. Anyone care to argue this point with me? <br>
<br>
#3 Koryo is an ass. I won't even go into depth. Anyone care to argue this with me?  Say what you will, but none of UI, including Bubu, would act with the sheer amount of disregard for other people he does.  <br>
<br>
After establishing this, where does that leave us. Well, it allows me to draw some conclusions.  I surmise that Magister, is a large, potent guild able to do a lot of epic type encounters. I also surmise that they lack the common courtesy that is every fellow player's right, and that they have some members I would never consider guilding with.   To sum it up, I don't think Magister is a place I'd like to be.  This is not to say you won't continue to grow(phat lewts will draw a certain caliber of people to you until the game dies).  This is also not to say you don't have a large number of quality people who have what I feel is the number one quality in the makeup of a person, respect.  You do. Your actions just don't correlate with these people.  Lets take the latest incident and break it down to its simplest form. <br>
<br>
Fact: UI was in Venril Sathir's antechamber buffing, preparing to kick his ass, something we haven't failed at since our first Umoja attempt.<br>
<br>
Fact: It was our turn in the rotation. I'm as anti-rotation/list as anyone, but when mobs are timed and there is a large demand, its the most dependable, polite way to solve the problem. <br>
<br>
Fact: You guys wanted in.  You had asked some people, I'm sure, but even had everyone told you a big buttfucking no, you can just gank him. Ganking him is killing him when he spawns.  It does not excuse pulling over a guild who obviously beat you to him.  I'll be sure to remember this next time you're buffing for something. <br>
<br>
Fact: Had we told you to kiss off, to fuck a goat, to suck Bubu's big sweaty ass, you should have accepted it. We didn't. We were reasonable.  We beat you there.  We tried to remain civilized. Your guild asshole decided he'd make take a course of action that you now admit was unadvisable.  Instead of standing up to him, you let him do his thing and then killed VS after he wiped us out because our enchanter had to handle his fucking adds.  <br>
<br>
Fact: Although many of you probably didn't agree with this move, you didn't stop it, or even speak against, thereby promoting it.  <br>
<br>
Fact: Had you chosen to disregard the rotation(a perfectly viable decision) we still beat you there. <br>
<br>
Thats the situation. We beat you there. We were buffing to kill it. You wanted it, you took it, shit on everyone else.  Well kiss my ass folks.  That ain't the way things work.  I'm sure you'll read my post, laugh it off, make fun of me or my guild. But if one person, a good, quality person, reads this, and decides that they'd rather join another guild than you, I consider it a successful post. If one current member decides to rethink his place in the guild and leave, I've accopmlished my goal. Hell, if you start having a little respect for others I'll be the first one to wish you all the best.  Maybe you can kill the most shit, but as far as quality of member goes, your way down at the bottom.<br>
<br>
Your neighborhood longwinded treehugger,<br>
Pharmur Fucking Brown<br>
<br>
PS: If I lose any friends over this, fine. If me stating my opinion over the group you choose to include yourself in is enough to break off a friendship, its not worth it anyway.  If I'm friends with you, this post is obviously not directed at you anyway, I make it a point not to associate with the people I'm criticizing.  I know if my guild did this, I'd be busting some heads.  I will not put up with this blatant disregard for a fellow person.  Its not how I was raised.  This expected double standard Magister seems to feel it deserves is not going to happen if I can help it.  I'm not expecting that much of a positive response.  I know most of Magister will stick together. I know many people will back their friends instead of looking at the facts and breaking them down.  But this is my opinion. Its not just mine. I know quite a few people agree with me. Whether they choose to proclaim it here or not is at their discretion. Toodles......<br>
<br>
PPS: If anyone wants to have a chat with me ingame about this incident, any EQ incident, the coming NFL season, Easter, why the BoSox always fold, or whether or not Britney's boobs are real, I am always up for a debate. Shoot me a tell ingame. Later.<br>

<br>
First of all, I'm not touching the Karnor's Castle/Venril Sathir part of this. Far as I'm concerned...dead issue, shit happens, get over it.<br>
<br>
As to the some of the other things in this post...<br>
<br>
Perhaps, as a guild, Magister doesn't really have much regard for other guilds or players. But if that is the case, the main reason behind it is the fact that by coincidence of where we usually hunt, we almost never see other players or guilds. <br>
<br>
When we do run into them, we try to make those encounters amiable. For all the complaining back and forth that happens between Magister and MS...we work our rotations out decently and get along ok. I still consider some of my best friends in game to be in MS.<br>
<br>
As to our being &quot;uber&quot; or not? I don't really care if someone else thinks we are uber. I agree, that before the cleric nerf (ch adding so much aggro..you remember) Da`Kor was at the TOP of the Velious game. But when a third of your guild quits...that's gonna slow you down. <br>
<br>
We had to recruit, rebuild and reorganize. And I think we have done a damn good job. How many guilds would have just shrugged, gotten bitter and pharmed the shit out of plane of growth for the rest of their days. Sometimes hitting up Kunark dragons and generally getting into people's way? I don't know...but I do know that we had that same choice and we chose to kick some ass. <br>
<br>
I have been having the best time I've had in EQ for the past several months. From taking on Sleeper's Tomb to killing mobs deep in Temple of Veeshan...it's been a wild ride, one I want to see continue. <br>
<br>
Vindicator, Statue, Ikatiar the Venom...a number of server firsts and progress towards getting back to the top of the Velious game. <br>
<br>
We have tried really hard as a guild to be places where no one else is in our way. We have almost completely turned our back on the old world mobs everyone else scrambles to kill. <br>
<br>
I like you Gilgamel...but I never asked for your approval, not for me or my guild. Don't like us? Get over it...cause we don't care. <br>
<br>
I don't play EQ to be liked by other people. I play to spend time with friends and my guild and to tackle the tougher obstacles in this game. I play to have fun. <br>
<br>
I support my guildmates 100%. I value each and every one of them as guildmates and as friends. I voted &quot;yes&quot; on all but the oldest members (cause they were the ones voting on me), and I don't think I made any mistakes. <br>
<br>
Want to talk to me in game? Well...soon as this f'ed up week is over with, I should be back in game...have at it. <br>

It certainly wasn't because we thought the people still playing suck.  There are, in fact, several Magister members who remain a part of Da`Kor and will continue to do so.<br>
<br>
Our reasons for disbanding were many and, quite frankly, none of your business.<br>

And Nire, come on man, don't take Arnwolf out of context to try to make him look bad.  Arn is one friggin person who does NOT deserve that and you know what he was saying with his post.  It was the only even remotely bitter line in response to a post that was 110% flamebait.  After being called a loser and an asshole and a gimp, should he say &quot;hey, thanks, that means a lot to me&quot;?  Is that how your responded when people were unfairly roasting you?<br>

Saying &quot;this doesn't apply to my friends&quot; doesn't help because your &quot;friends&quot; are hurt by the brutal teardown you did of *their* friends with your post.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/unirecnadthetrademaster.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Nirecnad the Trademaster</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 990<br> <font color=#E9D756>(6/16/01 8:01:22 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Dear Magister, </span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>

This quote is in reply to Gilg's grief against your guild. What is Arnwolf saying here? You don't like us?(because we steamrolled over you) We don't care.<br>
I simply made it straight to the point.<br>
<br>
I see a lot of problems in this whole issue. One thing that bothers me, is that Magister swears up and down that they have been trying hard as hell to get a spot into the rotation for 2 months. Yet all of the people who are somewhat incharge of the rotation (Yenom, Khael ect.) Say that either they haven't talked to you at all in regards to VS or they only breifly discussed it with you. Someone is lying, or stretching the truth. *shrug* It just doesn't gell. *note: I'm not accusing magister, I'm am saying that _someone_ here isn't quite on the level* <p> <IMG SRC=http://nirecnad.bizland.com/nire.gif></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uealan01.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ealan01</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 152<br> <font color=#E9D756>(6/16/01 8:10:29 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Dear Magister, </span><hr size=1> Gil was posting a flame against the guild as a whole and not speaking to the VS incident.  Gil basically stated that he has a serious, personal, problem with Magister (not with just the VS incident).<br>
<br>
Given the tone, it is pretty obvious that Arnwolf's reply was certainly not worthy of being picked apart and broken down.  If he sounded harsh when he said &quot;we don't care&quot; I am sure it was because he was feeling a little beaten up after reading Gil's attack.  You should be able to understand that man.<br>
<br>
As for the rotation and what I said to Khael and others at the time, look me up in game if you actually care. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uk1ssk1ng.showPublicProfile?language=EN>K1SSK1nG</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 266<br> <font color=#E9D756>(6/16/01 10:17:05 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Dear Magister, </span><hr size=1> on another topic, Magister=Stalin<br>

I was saying that I have never lived my life with the intention of pleasing other people. I live by the standards of friendship, honor and personal conduct that I find most suitable to my personality. <br>
<br>
Pleasing other people, to whom I have no obligation, has never been a priority of mine. I consider any approval or satisfaction other people may feel towards me to be purely coincidental to my chosen lifestyle. I would consider it a beneficial coincidence, but by no means a requirement.<br>
<br>
It is not a goal of myself or my guild to obtain the approval of other people on this server. If you ask me to help you...and I help you, I don't do so because I want you to like me...I do so because that is who I am. <br>
<br>
Ideally, I would love to have the frienship, approval and acceptance of everyone on this server for myself and my guild. But I will not alter who I am for that purpose. Approval is a decision you are left to make on your own, and NOT something I will pander towards or regret the loss of. <br>
