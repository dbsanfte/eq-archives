<br>
Well this technically is not a scam, and im possibly wrong but I dont think so.<br>
<br>
Well I think I have been screwed out of a FBSS, Gem-Inlaid Gauntlets, and Velium Roundshield. Its not the items that i mind being stolen, its the principle. I have already won a 2nd fbss(luck), and a friend lent me some crustacean shell armor which uses those slots. So its not the items.<br>
<br>
Well anyway here is what happened.<br>
<br>
Last wensday i think it was, I won an fbss in guk. I was in ec trying to sell some items for a bit and i had no luck so I was gonna head back to guk. Me of course being slightly greedy i wanted to transfer my fbss onto an alt that could use it so i could roll on any that dropped in guk. So anyway i check my friends list and noone on, so i ask if anyone in the guild is nearbye that could hold the items. Angelflower said she would so i gave her the a SSB to hold between chars, then ran to the bank and got the 3 items mentioned before. I handed them to her, camped logged back in and she was gone. I waited around the area for around 20 minutes cursing to myself. Then i went to guk to hunt, no luck getting a group. i was doing /w all friends (and had added her to it) after about an hour she got back on. I quickly logged in my alt that was in ec and asked her if she had gone ld, she said she had and too meet her in the hidden inn to get the items back. I did a /w angelflower and noticed she wasnt in the zone. I then accidently zoned into nro, did a /w and noticed she was in it. I was about to send her a tell but then she disapaered again.<br>
<br>
After about a week, wensday to be exact, i was on the efreeti raid and was bored to i did /w all friends to see if any where on to talk to. I noticed angelflower was on and sent her a /t and asked her what happened, she said her comp had broke so i asked her if she could meet one of my friends in EC with the items since i couldnt leave, she said sure but she had to check something first. I died during the efreeti thing and while waiting for a rez i asked if she could meet me at the druid rings in sro. she said ok and then logged off.<br>
<br>
A few hours later i died again on the raid and noticed she was on again, i asked again for her to meet me there and she said to let her med she was in dl(why when she got on she immideatly tped there rather then asking if she could meet me to return the item, if she was innocent anyway). After a bit i was waiting there and she logged off and i got ported back to the raid before CR)<br>
<br>
I was on today and didnt see her on at all.<br>
<br>
During the time this was happening i had a friend put her on his friends list to check when i wasnt around and i mentioned the incident in /gu. The day it happened Razz(person in guild) said that angelflower wasnt the kind of person to do that and that i should trust guildmates. And Pani(person in guild) said that he knew her in RL and that she wouldnt do something like that.<br>
<br>
Well anyway, i was willing to give the benefit of the doubt the first day, and even the first time the other day. But it has been too coincidental always going LD before meeting me.<br>
<br>
If she really was having major comp problems i am seriously sorry, but if those items arent returned within 2 days im posting something on the scammers section of the emarr board, because i will assume i have been screwed out of the items.<br>
<br>
Again if i am wrong, and she really is having major comp troubles, and didnt know that the hidden in was in Ec not nro, and she dforgot about returning it and went to DL to hunt, i am deeply sorry, but the evidence seems to point to that im not going to be getting those items back and i would like to prevent other people from losing theres. <br>
*end c&p*<br>
<br>
Well anyway, seemed to learn the hard way ya cant always trust someone just cause they're in your guild.  Just posting this here so none of you get screwed outta items cause people who would do that, probabally would do other scamming things. Oh yeah and the "today" i refered to was like 3 days ago and she hasnt been on since. <p><br><font color=black>Krenuix Formshifter</font>

After this point I really don't give a fuck. Need before greed or not, I honestly don't care. Sure I'm going to watch out for Angelflower but handing stuff to an alternate so you can roll again is pathetic, so is claiming a friend lent you an item so you can have another. It's all about the fact that you felt you needed 2 FBSS's before someone else got their first and now instead of 2 sashes you have none. Poetry man. Poetry.<br>
<br>
Oh and Ogmuk...I don't have an FBSS. <p><HTML><CENTER>

And who said i ended up with none? I won a 2nd like 2 days later that i gave to my alt(to use not to hold btw).<br>

And giving it to an alt to hold is the exact same thing as people winning one and selling it then comming back the next day, and theres nothing wrong with that. <p><br><font color=black>Krenuix Formshifter</font>

Then again since you all do inhabit the same places (and I am not saying every player that goes to these places is like this but its widely accepted that those 2 dungeons are home to the GBN people) maybe GNB will only work because you are all out to fuck each other anyway.<br>

Just so you're clear on this one Krenuix, I consider you to be as much as a scammer as Angelflower if not more. I base that simply on the fact that there may be extrenuating cicumstances such as frequent LD involved here or Angelflower may just have been teaching your scamming ass a lesson.<br>

He is not a scammer. He didn't ninja loot, he didn't steal anyone elses property. He joined a group won an item that he gave it to a guildmate to do a transfer, and that person won't give it back. <br>
<br>
This is not a big deal here folks and it's pretty sad that you sit here and bash someone for something that a thousand other people do frequently in this game. <br>

All he did was come here and report a scammer so you too wouldn't get scammed. Hmm seems like an asshole scammer to me. I think not. <br>

Was this just a random thought or were you reffering to me mentioning a friend lent me those items, i was just saying that because i wanted people to read this to know i dont really give a crap about the items not since they have all been replaced, just the principle of something being stolen.<br>
<br>
Me, a scammer? As panidwen said, I have never ninjad, never taken items, have never tried to run any scams, never went ld after looting an item and before randoming. Actually after thinking a bit, yes putting something on an alt to hold so i can be in on other randoms does sound pretty cheap, but its no diffrent from winning the item, then selling it and going back and randoming again, which I was under the impression isnt scamming, most people who go to guk do that with items they dont need, are they all scamming?<br>
<br>
And trying to get 2 before some people get their first? Actually it was more of trying to get a shot at 2 before some people get there 7th(which i have seen). I have seen some people in there that have won none unfortunatly, and i have seen others that seem to win one every other day.<br>
<br>
Yes, i was trying to increase my chance of getting an fbss, considering its an item worth about equivelent to all my equip put together, but did that cheat anyone out of an item?not really. You seem to thinking that i won an fbss, immediatly left the group and went to ec to get someone to transfer something for my alt to hold then try'd to go back 5 minutes later and get in the same group.<br>
<br>
And was it possible angelflower is having computer problems and thats why she hasnt returned it? Yes, and i hope that is what happened. But in 2 days it will have been 2 weeks since the items got stolen, and i know if someone had transfered a valuable item to me i would be doing as much as i could to get that item back to them asap so they didnt think i was trying to steal it. She could just have limited playing time, but that doesnt explain why she told me to meet her in the wrong zone(i guess possibly she could have been confused as too which inn was the hidden in, which i mentioned in my original post) and the other times she was porting all over the place when i offered to meet her at places near places she could teleport. Also she didnt mention any connection problems, or go ld while i was transfering the ssb.<br>
<br>
Is it possible she was teaching me a lesson? No, maybe you have the impression shes robin hood and stealing an fbss from a greedy enchanter and selling it for 1 plat to any level 40+ warrior without one because she thought me transfering it to an alt to hold so i could try to win another one was wrong. But that isnt it at all, since all i asked was for someone to transfer items between chars fer me, no mention of the purpose(which im sure someone will say i knew that what i was doing was horribly horribly evil evil and knew noone with a shred of decency would transfer the items if i told them why, but there wasnt any realy reason i didnt mention why, most people just ask if anyone can hold stuff for you alt with no reasons givin, and i didnt even think to say why). <p><br><font color=black>Krenuix Formshifter</font>

I have no sympathy for you either.

It's all to do with courtesy. You say you arent cheating someone out of anything and you havent ninja'd and you haven't scammed but the plain and simple fact is that by  randoming on an item, then transferring it or selling it (Im not saying you sold it, I'm just comparing like for like as I did when I said &quot; so is claiming a friend lent you an item so you can have another&quot;.) you stopped someone else from having that sash.<br>
<br>
Your argument is <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Actually it was more of trying to get a shot at 2 before some people get there 7th<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> Does this make you any less wrong because others are wrong with you? The fact that some people have 7 sashes has no bearing on it. <br>
<br>
Some people don't have one FBSS. I can promise you that because I get sick of hearing about people who have been camping the frenzy for 2 months without winning, losing out to people like you who have more then one. These are the people that you have scammed because they are not getting an item they deserve because you feel you deserve more then one.<br>
<br>
Nuzum, you're argument that you farmed FBSS's because you couldn't get in other groups holds no water. Just becuase you couldn't get into a group you felt that you had the right to inflict the same on others??<br>
<br>
I have no problem against people having multiples of an item on alternates as long as your not spoiling anothers fun.....or do you think its fun to be stuck at teh zone while some selfish brat gets 2 items to further himself? <p><HTML><CENTER>
