(An ezboard private message from Slazzer)<br>
<br>
hey, this is Duec.<br>
i do not know of what happened to your vox raid, here is the story.<br>
<br>
I just finished a part of my epic for duec in nurga and i logged on my druid and ported a group of guildies to Cobalt Scar and we were going to kill in sky skrine and just as i hit the ramp to zone in i went LD and could not get on for about 2 to 3 hours later, i figured there was a patch of servers went down, when i did get on i was heading to GD to bank in thurgadina and in guild chat someoen said duec did it or it was duec in are guild and then i was LD instant and went to the sign in screen and it said i was temperarily suspended.<br>
<br>
as slazzer said about a friend i had that was banned he did know my password and i am assuming it was him, i can not contact him or change my password yet untill i get back on, my fried was banned twice for stealing and ninja lotting stuff but he does not have an active account as far as i know so i do not know what he would have done with the items he <br>
got from your raid, maby he has another account i dunno i havent spoken to him in about 2 to 3 months now cause he moved away on me, before he moved away he would hang out at my house all day and he made a plan on doing this to someoen we know as a friend also, but im guessing he got me instead =/.<br>
<br>
you can e-mail me back at *edit: removed email*<br>
<br>
dunno if u still wanna be firends or not =( <br>
<br>
<br>
<hr><br>
<br>
<br>
I really dont know what to make of all this... I liked Duec, thought he was a great player, and a nice person... someone I enjoyed hanging around with in game.  Im just still really mixed up about the whole thing and I dont understand certain things... like 1.  why would this person (known scammer or shithead) have access to his account 2.  how the "friend" just happened to know there was a vox raid 3.  why the "friend" go to the gm and say "I didnt mean it, I was payed to do it, give the stuff back for me and tell them Im sorry"<br>
<br>
I questioned if Slazzer and Duec are the same person but he emailed a second time from his account and said that Slazzer was on his computer and it didnt go back to the original person.<br>
<br>
/sigh... I really just wish this wouldnt have happened in the first place... I want to say "dude, I forgive ya" but I dont want to be a total fool... any feedback??? <p>~Schmoopy~

<br>
Once upon a time a long long time ago a lot people bugged me to lead a Vox raid - unfortunately I took this task and we ended up failing (see big ass long flame started by some cleric whom I'll never speak to again :P)  Duec happened to be on this raid.  <br>
<br>
Now I can't remember if it was my raid or the raid I logged into the next day (being camped in Pmera and all, I know I ran into him there too).  anyhow - at some point he said he had to log but someone would still be on Duec.  This new person was his cousin.  He had a monk as well and was playing Duec for a bit.<br>
<br>
The reason I posted this is because I saw how you posted about Duec sending an email from Slazzer's name and you questioning if they were the same person.  Well maybe not, perhaps he is the &quot;cousin&quot; who was playing him.  (Slazzer is a lizzie monk yes?)<br>
<br>
Before I hit the Add Reply button - I just want to make sure that no one points fingers at me saying that I am accussing Slazzer of being the real person who logged on Duec by saying that Duec has a cousin with account access.  I am not doing that - simply just stating that Slazzer and Duec may in fact be two seperate people.  (personally when I happened to be on a raid with both of these people I liked them :P) <p><div align=right><a href=http://www.eqeclipse.com border=0><img src=http://www.eqeclipse.com/moltsig.jpg></img></a></div><BR></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/unogem.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Nogem</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/misc_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 229<br> <font color=#E9D756>(12/4/01 7:06:29 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The explanation...</span><hr size=1> How long before the vox raid was he in Nurga?

<br>
I hate bieng put in this postion so I know you are not much enjoying it either. <br>
Here is what I would do in your postion.<br>
First look at his track record how long has be been raiding with you? Have you ever personally witnessed anything hinting to his capability of pulling something like this? Can anyone here stick up for him as a character witness?<br>
I am always one to give the other person the benefit of the doubt especially if there is a chance I could be wrong and someone else is on the line. <br>
<br>
I think the lesson has been learned here, and if it is not then Duec's account will most probably be canceled indefinitly. I don't think that the Emarr community has very much to lose by giving Duec the chance to reclaim his name. I mean think about if it was your account that got hacked by someone and all these evil deeds were done in your name? <br>
<br>
I'm not saying let by gones be by gones but he has made an effort to try and clear his name. Most of the people I have seen that do this type of thing, Make one shot to try and get away with it. Then everyone asks them to make the effort to clear thier name and they never follow through.<br>
<br>
Push him. make him prove that it was not him that did it. If it was he will eventually cave in. And if it was not him then at least we all can say we tried.<br>

<br>
When you /q out of the game you are sent to the server screen.  You have to wait a minute or two to be able to log back in because your character is still in the game.  Taking this into hand, his friend could not have logged on while he was playing because Duec was still in the game at the time.  <br>
<br>
You USED to be able to log in while someone else was on the account and boot them onto an offline zone where all the monsters were there but wouldn't react, there were no players either, but that was a long time ago.<br>
<br>
Verant changed it so if you were in the game in any way you would stay out of the game at the server screen and you would get a message saying &quot;You currently have an active character in the game at the moment, please wait a few minutes and try again.&quot;<br>
<br>
So I wouldn't be able to believe the reason and story stated in his email, personally... unless I have my brother or a RL friend try it from their account and it works.<br>

Common sense tells you all that is BS.  First of all he would not have LD'd from someone trying to log him in.

I note from the original post that Assassination, the Alt who Ninja'd, had appeared to be camped out very near to Vox, ready to be fired up when the opportunity to loot arose.<br>
<br>
To me, there is one simple test for whether or not this was a pre-planned scam.  We all create Alts (well, apart from me, I only ever played one char), and the first thing we usually do is to tell our guildies and friends our Alts names, so they can contact us in game if needed.  OK, level 1 mules are probably excepted from this rule, but I understand Duec's alt was a lvl 20 rogue.  <br>
<br>
If he had got his alt to lvl 20 without ever telling his friends or guildies his name, then this might imply to it was especially created to carry out this single vile act.<br>

So even if you believe the message (I really don't know Duec, so I have no opinion whatsoever about that), there is still a mistake there that everyone who reads here should learn from: if anyone tells you about the mischiefs he's ready to do to someone, make sure that this person has no critical information about you and try to protect the others from that asshole.<br>

Truer words have never been spoken. If this is the first time this person has ever &quot;screwed up&quot; give them the benefit of the doubt and move on. I know I've screwed up royally before (in real life) and been given the benefit of proving myself capable of getting the job done. Once I showed my boss it was a 'one time deal' he has never tossed it back in my face again.<br>
<br>
I suggest you do the same. Allow this person to show you that they meant no harm and that it was infact some one else controlling the toon. Their actions and conduct will eventually show you what you need to know.<br>
<br>
And for all those that say &quot;don't give them a second chance&quot;, all I can say is you were probably given several chances to prove yourself. Why not extend the same courtesy?  <p><b>May the Circle be unbroken</b><br><br>

Many of us have been given second chances, or more.  However, those chances have rarely involved ninja looting or deliberately ruining a friend's event. <p>Ahry - hero of Gaoth an Iar, Percival server <BR>

When an enchie in my old guild ninja looted an epic piece and camped out. He came back a few days later saying his friend did it. Needless to say you are responsible for the actions you take in game and for those that use your account. Give your password to people, that is what you get. Its just as much as the accounts owners fault as the person borrowing it.  <p><center><img src="http://members.shaw.ca/dfitzpatrick/Anasig5.jpg"></a></center>

<br>
Anyhow, onto his story.  It seems fishy to me also, for many of the reasons stated above.  E.G. Going LD when his friend supposedly logs his account on.  And also knowing this guy was planning to screw one of their other friends over and not telling the other friend seems like a crappy thing to do.  But hey,  we're all free to give people second chances with us.  That's the beauty of being human.  I'm just saying that I personally wouldn't, based on what I've seen.<br>

Which.  Can't.  Happen.<br>
<br>
There can be no debate about this, because it is IMPOSSIBLE for this to happen in the sequence Duec has related.  <br>
<br>
Everyone saying &quot;Give Duec a second chance&quot; should now realize that he had his second chance with the E-mail he sent to Jexielia, and he blew it.  Again.<br>
<br>
So -- tell me -- anyone think this maroon is worthy of a THIRD chance? <p><a href="http://home.earthlink.net/~mlaye" target="_blank">

Also it is rather hard to get to vox and since he was precamped there before the raid that shows that it was preplanned by someone. Also why would someone steal something if they dont play eq (Diluted). *i dont know how to do quotes , ezboard challenged*.  Exactly though. Anyway sounds like bullshit to me.  Just my 2 cents<br>
