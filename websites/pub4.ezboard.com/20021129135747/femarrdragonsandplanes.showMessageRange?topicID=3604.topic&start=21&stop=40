Putting the raid members on the spot like that is just plain fuc<!>ked up, no one is going to say she should be ezcluded, cause they do not want to come off as a loot whore. And I don't give a shi<!>t if they let her in or not, nor is that the issue, the issue is that any reasonably minded person would have excluded themselvs from the roll on the CoF.

I hope that was misstyped, because that was one of the most flawed pieces of logic that I have ever seen. <br>
<br>
I was not there, and I DO have every right to speak my mind and illustrate my opinions. And as I have already stated about 3 times; I, and most others here, don't have a problem with the raid rules, we have a problem with someone beeing so selfabsorbed that they can't see that they just steped way out of line. I don't expect, or wish for, people to be totally selfless, but in a situation like that have a little fuc<!>king class and give something back to those that just gave you so much. <p><BR><BR>

When most raids are 50+ that means you have two levels in which to get the loot or sit gather AA points and dust in order to get your items.  The majority of the recent raids have been defaulted books for pallies.  Knotz herself has been on these and was greedy enough before to think that losing a roll meant that she deserved a book.  Why does it come as a surprise that she would stay in on the rolls after getting both books in a single night?<br>
<br>
I've personally only found one raid leader whose rules I could agree with and wouldn't be caught dead leading one for the simple reason that everyone who does gets attacked on this very board, no matter how ethical they are or how well they follow their own posted rules.  I'm glad I don't have an epic item on these dragons and I guess I'll have to save up and buy the items I *do* want from them.  Conveniently, I'd have to buy them anyway if I went on these raids, so it's a time saver.

Both of theese raids were my first attempt at leading either of those dragons.  I dont attend pick up raids, and I dont lead them.  I'm so sorry if my loot rules dont exactly live up to your standards. /giggle<br>
<br>
Answer one question for me, as I'm not really interested in dragging up old dragon raids and loot rules.  On any vox/naggy raids if a paladin wins the book are they out of other rolls?<br>
<br>
I made a split second decision on this, as I never specified one way or the other previously.  I thought the fairest thing was to let those in attendance decide, and thats what I did.  Anyone who spoke up said to include both people who recieved epic pieces on that raid, and thats what I did. <br>
<br>
In any case, whats done is done.  If you had any problems with it, you were given plenty of time to speak up.  If anyone had complained at all, or stated negative feedback about Knotz or Pooganes being in on the rolls then they would have been taken out.  In other words, if you have a problem dont wait until after the fact.  Speak up and help the raid leader out a bit.  I'm only human, I can screw up but never did I promise to read your mind.<br>

<br>
 You cannot be angry with Fy or Knotz. You will find that on most raids...epic items and regular drops are seperate rolls. It's the way that the loot rolls. There were 15 other possibilities..apparently Knotz had it in the stars for her. My wife was on the raid, we both saw the question about the roll....I didn't see anyone speak up.<br>
<br>
 I went to Vox and seem to recall Fystie saying that this was her first dragon raid. She made some mistakes...which I tried to &quot;nicely&quot; bring up..and I hope she didn't take my &quot;complaints&quot; as whining or bothering...just wanted to let her know for future reference...MAYBE rather than flame..you could make some suggestions?...Although I'm pretty sure all the whining made it so Fystie would rather not ever lead another raid again. Bottom line..the rules were posted...they were stated prior to the raid (both raids) and I would venture to say that Fy did an excellent job of killing 2 dragons in one night faster than I ever have. =o) Grats Knotz you lucky SOB. <br>
<br>
P.S. If you could get me in good with the God of Randoms...I'd really appreciate it...kthx.<br>

Once again, I do not fault you for what you did, I think you did a rather good job it being your first time and all.<br>
<br>
All I am saying is that if she had any common courtasy she would have asked to be removed from the random on the CoF.... But that is a personal choice, it just so happens that I would have made it differantly. <p><BR><BR>

 I'm not entirely sure what you mean to say? Not that I have a problem with you or wish to start beef with you ....but are you telling me that for all my effort and hard work that goes into leading a raid..I don't deserve to reserve a book for my own special cuddly happy flower-knight?<br>
<br>
I wouldn't say so much that she was so greedy she felt that losing a roll meant she deserved the book..as much as the raid leader felt that the book, and giving the book to Knotz was her/his reward for leading a sucessful raid. <br>
<br>
Basically..I'm not sure that reserving an item for someone constitutes greed. I'm not sure though..=o/ Now that you bring it up..it does seem a little greedy. Am I rambling? Ack!<br>

d) When items were up for rolls if you wanted in you were to send a tell to the raid leader saying you wanted in.  Knotz Did NOT tell Fystie that she wanted in on the CoF.  but Fystie asked the raid party. and many spoke up saying to include knotz and Poo in on the roll. so she did.<br>
<br>
There were 15 people in on the second roll it was shocking that she did win.. heck she didn't even realize she won until I sent her a tell telling her what she won. <br>
<br>
<br>
I believe that Jex and her cronies just have a problem with Knotz and looking to stir up trouble or something should have been said when Fystie asked the whole raiding party ... If you missed it.. it is your falt .Not Fystie's and Not Knotz's<br>

As far as Pallies having haste items.. Haste is not included on their epic..so other haste items are needed.  Congratz knotz... I like others would love to have such luck, Hopefully my warrior will win one soon! <p>Grand Mistress skill in Jewelery Crafting(250)<BR>

Easiest way to kill Vox is rush into her room and past her.  Turn around 180 degrees and beat her on top of the rock next to the tunnel.  From up there her breath weapon cannot hit anything and the fight becomes trivial.<br>
<br>
Naggy is a little bit tougher in that you have to pin him into the wall next to the gate.  From there healers can heal from behind walls to avoid the AOE.<br>
<br>
Now anyone should be able to lead a successful Naggy/Vox raid.  Anyone want to know anymore stratagies? <p>

Regardless of the /shouts about who gets what...<br>

the honorable thing would have been to bow respectably out of another piece of dragon loot (or loot in general) to allow others the opportunity to 'win' something. Not to be asked to, not to be told to, but to know to.<br>
<br>
But...EQ is defined as a game of greed, it comes down to how 'nice' the person really is.<br>
<br>
Thats the single most #1 biggest complaint about pickup groups. Loot. ie Greed.<br>
<br>
ps. I personally like the groups where people argue about <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> giving</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->(not getting) the piece of loot to the other party members. As in &quot; you take it, you need it more..&quot; &quot; no YOU take it, I have this thingamabob&quot; (usually only found in guild groups, but there is always the exception. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ukiliara.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kiliara</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 27<br> <font color=#E9D756>(9/5/02 3:38:00 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3604.topic&index=36>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: re.</span><hr size=1> &gt; I'm not entirely sure what you mean to say?

<br>
Coajik, no I'm not saying anything about loot reservation.  I think that's the best way to get the items you need from these raids and don't find it greedy at all.  Accepting other loot when you're already getting the item you claim is the one you're after seems pretty greedy, though.  If it were me, I would have bowed out of other loot rolls and even had the CoF rerolled even though I'd love to have one. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uigota.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Igota</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 1250<br> <font color=#E9D756>(9/5/02 4:37:32 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3604.topic&index=37>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: re.</span><hr size=1> <font color='yellow'>I believe that Jex and her cronies just have a problem with Knotz and looking to stir up trouble or something should have been said when Fystie asked the whole raiding party ...

<br>
Nice, little obsessed are we? I am not a crony, I am not defending her, and I am not trying to "get back at Knotz."<br>
<br>
No one is saying that they missed the question to let her in and thought she should not be in on the roll. God damn you a dense, it has been stated about 10 times in this thread already (by more then just me), that it was in poor form to not pull herself out of the roll.<br>
<br>
Personally, if I were leading the raid, I would not have put the group on the spot by asking them if they would want her in on it, but that is just my way of doing it. One of the reasons I don't go on many dragon raids is that I don't like the rules of the people leading them, and I don't care enough to lead my own.<br>
<br>
And for the record, in the other thread you are talking about I did not have ANY problem with Knotz, only her friends that enjoyed beating a dead horse. This is the first time I have ever felt negatively about her. Oops, there goes your conspiracy theory.<br>
