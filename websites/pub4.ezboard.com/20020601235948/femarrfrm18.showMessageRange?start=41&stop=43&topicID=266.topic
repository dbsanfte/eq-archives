Where to start?<br>
<br>
Black pledge of allegiance- in the original post it was edited and I don't really feel like hunting down the school's website. I don't think I want to trade places with the &quot;white&quot; teacher if the sample is indicative of the source material. Saying a seperate pledge IS divisive and not the same as having a flag displayed.<br>
<br>
Someone said their ancestors were allowed to hang their flag since they came to this country. I'm curious what flag that was, you might consider reading a bit about living conditions and ethnic tensions in New York City at the turn of the last century.<br>
<br>
One person said, or implied, that they were tired of hearing about Native American discrimination and another wanted to know why people are still going on about the Holocaust. Both of these were instances of genocide and have been either suppressed, denied, or come under attack by revisionists.<br>
<br>
I don't remember ever hearing anyone claiming slavery never existed in this country. I don't remember hearing anyone questioning the number of slaves that were kept or shipped over. And I doubt that wide-spread killing of slaves took place, certainly not with the intent of removing them from the planet.<br>
<br>
Slaves were not the only ones to suffer in the class structure of 19th century America. Not every low income, non-slave joined groups such as the &quot;Patrollers&quot; and the &quot;Klan&quot;. Those who did passed their hatred and anger on to many of their descendants, and &quot;blacks&quot; were not their only victims. It is people who harbor like feelings that are responsible for much of the discrimination in our country. <br>
<br>
Before anyone purposely misunderstands what I'm saying, I don't deny slaves were beaten and killed. I am only saying genocide was not the intent. All of these things are a part of our Nation's past that we cannot afford to forget or ignore.<br>
<br>
As for reparation, there is no way to make it equitable. As long as people desire to be compensated for past damages suffered by their ancestors, they will continue to feel victimized. <p>Cattundanser Whitefang<BR>

<br>
I must say though that slavery has undergone probably as much revisionism if not more than the holocaust or the indian genocide. The first motion picture ever made is called &quot;Birth of a Nation&quot;. I own a copy. It is quite interesting and humorous to me, kind of like the whitey version of Reefer Madness. In Birth of a Nation, however instead of showing people becoming crazed maniacs from doing pot like Reefer Madness, it showed how the Klan saved the South from the Negro threat. Entertaining now, but probably scary shit to blacks back then. Genocide did occur with the slaves, there are tales of plantation owners committing the final solution before there slaves gained freedom and even before that after Britain banned the slave trade a slaver ship would shackle all there slaves together so that if a British Man-o-war approached they only had to throw one overboard and the rest would all follow. They only had to make one trip out of three or four to make a profit. After they were given there freedom they were still subject to prejudicial juries if they were even given a trial before the mobs lynched them. All it took was for a white to point at a black and make an accusation and he was as good as dead. Hence, the blacks learned to be subservient to whites. <br>
<br>
Yes, I agree that reparations are a virtual impossibility, but we built a holocaust museum for people who we were not responsible for there victimization, and when the idea of using the money owed to the blacks to build an underground railroad museum is brought up many people like to shout about how we don't owe the blacks anything anymore. Isn't it a type of double standard to allow the native americans and jews certain compensations we don't allow blacks?<br>
<br>
Just my perspective.<br>

Doing pretty good actually.<br>
<br>
As to your points:<br>
<br>
1 Yes, I'm aware of the things you mention. I just don't categorize them as genocide. 1 slaveowner here or there, and the ship captains you mention do not hold a Candle to the US Cavalry or the Third Reicht. Terrible as those things were, it's just not the same.<br>
<br>
2 I don't actually believe very many &quot;blacks&quot; were ever truly subservient to &quot;whites&quot;. I believe they did what they had to do to survive a horrendous situation. I believe many who appeared to be subservient were actually quite cunning in their behavior. That is meant as a compliment btw. It took strength, intelligence, Faith and fait to survive under the treatment that most were forced to endure.<br>
<br>
3 As far as building monuments... I say great!!! I never said there should not be acknowledgement of the history involved. I have no problem whatsoever in funding such a monument with my tax dollars, and/or charitable donations. Were it built in a locale that made it finacially accessible to me I would certainly be among the visitors.<br>
