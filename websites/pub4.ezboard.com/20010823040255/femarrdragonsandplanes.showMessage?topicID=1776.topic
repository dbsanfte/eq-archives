Enjoy =)<br>
<br>
From my agent in California.  A bit long, but worth the read...<br>
<br>
Bad American: Yes, I Guess I am A BAD American.<br>
<br>
I like big cars, big boats, big houses and naturally, big tits !<br>
<br>
I believe the money I make belongs to me and my family, not some mid-level governmental functionary with a bad comb-over who wants to give it away to crack addicts squirting out babies.<br>
<br>
I don't care about appearing compassionate.<br>
<br>
I think playing with toy guns doesn't make you a killer.<br>
<br>
I believe it's called the Boy Scouts for a reason.<br>
<br>
I think I'm doing better than the homeless.<br>
<br>
I don't think being a minority makes you noble or victimized.<br>
<br>
I have the right not to be tolerant of others because they are different, weird or piss me off.<br>
<br>
I know what SEX is and there are not varying degrees of it.<br>
Hell, just ask my wife.<br>
<br>
I don't celebrate Kwanzaa.  But if you want to that's fine; just don't feel like everyone else should have to.<br>
<br>
I believe that if you are selling me a Dairy Queen shake, pack of cigarettes, or hotel room you do it in English.  As of matter of fact, if you are an American citizen you should speak English.  My father and grandfather shouldn't have to die in vain so you can leave the countries you were born in to come disrespect ours.<br>
<br>
I think the cops have every right to shoot your sorry ass if<br>
you're running from them after they tell you to stop.  If you can't understand the word freeze or stop in English, see the previous line.<br>
<br>
I don't use the excuse &quot;it's for the children&quot; as a shield for unpopular opinions or actions. I know how to count votes and I feel much safer letting a machine with no political affiliation recount when needed.<br>
<br>
I know what the definition of lying is.<br>
<br>
I don't think just because you were not born in this country, you qualify for any special loan programs, gov't sponsored bank loans, etc., so you can you can open a hotel, c-store, trinket shop, or any damn thing else.<br>
<br>
I didn't take the initiative in inventing the Internet.<br>
<br>
I thought the Taco Bell dog was funny.<br>
<br>
I want them to bring back safe and sane fireworks.<br>
<br>
I think that being a student doesn't give you any more<br>
enlightenment than working at Blockbuster or Jack In The Box.<br>
<br>
I don't want to eat or drink anything with the words light, Lite or fat-free on the package.<br>
<br>
I did not go to some foreign country and risk my life in vain and defend our constitution so that decades later you can tell me it's a living document ever changing and is open to interpretation.<br>
<br>
I don't hate the rich.  I don't pity the poor.<br>
<br>
I know wrestling is fake.<br>
<br>
I've never owned or was a slave, and a large percentage of our forefathers weren't wealthy enough to own one either.<br>
<br>
I believe a self-righteous liberal with a cause is more<br>
dangerous than a Hell's Angel with an attitude.<br>
<br>
I want to know which church is it exactly where the &quot;Rev.&quot;<br>
Jessie Jackson preaches; and what exactly is his job function.<br>
<br>
I own a gun, you can own a gun, and any red blooded American<br>
should be allowed to own a gun, but if you use it in a crime then you will serve the time.  A rubber band and a paper clip is a dangerous weapon in the hands of someone with malicious intent.<br>
<br>
I worry about dying before I get even.<br>
<br>
I think Bill Gates has every right to keep every penny he made and continue to make more.  If it pisses you off, invent the next operating system that's better and put your name on the building.  Ask your buddy that invented the Internet to help you.<br>
<br>
I don't believe in hate crime legislation.  Even suggesting it pisses me off.  You're telling me that someone who is a minority, gay, disabled, another nationality, or otherwise different from the mainstream of this country has more value as a human being than I do as a white male. Hell, if someone kills anyone, I'd say that it's a hate crime.<br>
<br>
I like the convenience of buying oranges from a sidewalk vendor or while I'm waiting at a stop-light, and I'm pretty sure the Latin midget selling them to me is glad she no longer lives in a refrigerator box in East Dallas or is sleeping in the streets of her home country.<br>
<br>
We don't need more laws! Let's enforce the ones we already have.<br>
<br>
I think turkey bacon, turkey beef, turkey fake anything sucks.<br>
<br>
I believe that it doesn't take a village to raise a child, it takes a parent with the balls to stand up to the kid and spank his butt and say &quot;NO&quot;.<br>
<br>
I think tattoos and piercing are fine if you want them, but<br>
please don't pretend they are a political statement.<br>
<br>
I believe you don't have to speak with a lisp to pick out a<br>
couch for your living room.<br>
<br>
I'll admit that the only movie that ever made me cry was Ole<br>
Yeller(and maybe My Dog Skip).<br>
<br>
I didn't realize Dr.  Seuss was a genius until I had a kid.<br>
<br>
I will not be frowned upon or be looked down upon or be made to keep silent because I have these beliefs and opinions.  I thought this country allowed me that right.<br>
<br>
I will not conform or compromise just to keep from hurting<br>
somebody's feelings.<br>
<br>
I'm neither angry nor disenfranchised, no matter how desperately the mainstream media would like the world to believe otherwise.<br>
<br>
Yes, I guess by their definition, I'm a BAD American.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

Nope, you're not a bad American. You just sound overtly Republican, that's all. Shit... nobody's perfect. Many of these 'ideals' (while they are macho) are actually incorrect. An example:<br>
<br>
'I have the right not to be tolerant of others because they are different, weird or piss me off.'<br>
<br>
Incorrect. Maybe in the sense behind closed doors and on property that is in your name, but you have no right to be 'intolerant' of others in 99.9% of all other situations. Think about it.<br>
<br>
There are lots of other macho faggot comments in here that follow the same concept. It's like saying that most Republican white males beat there wives and have homosexual fantasies. It's using the lowest common denominator to justify pathetic behavior. Weak.<br>

Hmmm So how does it feel to share the the same view concerning guns as Adolf Hitler?<br>
<br>
Oh, I almost forgot to ask...How do you feel about say...Jews or Blacks?<br>
<br>
<br>
The point here Verdunae is this; There are many items that could be very dangerous in the hands of a child. Rather than name a long list of these items, I'll just leave with a bit of fact. It is the parents responsiblity to ensure that their children are educated in the dangers of these items and that these dangerous items are not accessible to them at a young age.<br>

Compassion, among a number of other traits, is the cornerstone of humanity.  Do you have to appear compassionate?  No.  It would probably give you more value as a human tho.  <br>

Perhaps not, perhaps so.  It CAN be shown that, especially in young children, it teaches a lack of respect for firearms.  If the one you are playing with now does no harm, and you are too young to realize that the other one does.........<br>

Considering said document was written over 200 years ago, and things have vastly changed since then, I'm glad that we can make adjustments.  Constitution has been ratified both before and after you were born.  Don't think it's gonna stop now.  Even right-wing conservatives propose change that benefits their view.<br>

It's called freedom of religion.  Anyone can start their own church.  You do not have to agree with a church to respect their right to worship as they see fit.  Or maybe you'd rather be in a country where your religious views get chosen for you?<br>

Playing the Hitler card makes you look stupid.  I've seen some great debates over gun control, and those debates had valid points regarding both sides.  None of them pulled out the Hitler card.<br>
<br>
I suggest if you want to debate gun control you learn FACTS, not rhetoric.  Altho, I have to point out if you want to believe in Hitler and his policies you have every right to in this country.  (as long as you don't violate the law with your paper clip and rubber band)<br>

Yeah I did, and I assume you mean that he did not write this (you are referring to the second line where he says his agent, not him, wrote/informed him of it). Did you read the FIRST line, where he basically said he agreed with it? Just because he didn't write it doesn't mean he doesn't share the idiocy of the author. I actually don't know what's worse... coming up with this drivel, or copying and pasting it in an EQ message board and giving it your personal trailor park thumbs up.<br>

<br>
You really just want to get me riled up as every other liberal who has flamed this post does.  Nice try but, it won't work <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .<br>
<br>
Let me see.  I think I'll insert some of these nice quotes to reply to like you veteran ranters do.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> &quot;I have the right not to be tolerant of others because they are different, weird or piss me off.<br>
<br>
Incorrect. Maybe in the sense behind closed doors and on property that is in your name, but you have no right to be 'intolerant' of others in 99.9% of all other situations. Think about it.<br>
<br>
There are lots of other macho faggot comments in here that follow the same concept. It's like saying that most Republican white males beat there wives and have homosexual fantasies. It's using the lowest common denominator to justify pathetic behavior. Weak.&quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
<br>
Actually professor I do have that right and you looked right past the obvious reasons why. Let me enlighten you, oh wait, better not use that word, might ruin the &quot; Roger Ebert sitting in a trailer giving a thumbs up to your favorite homo smut flick featuring a Rush Limbaugh look alike&quot; image.<br>
<br>
Why I have that right follows:<br>
<br>
1.  If I do not like the atmosphere in my workplace, I have the right to change jobs <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
2.  If I do not like the food a restaurant serves, I have the right to not eat there.<br>
<br>
3.  If I do not like the way a store does business, I do not have to shop there.<br>
<br>
4.  If someone like you moved next door to me in my neighborhood, I have the right to move.<br>
<br>
5.  If I do not want to be in the neighborhood of one of your gay pride parades, I can be elsewhere.<br>
<br>
Shall I go on, or do you now see the big picture of that statement.  It simply means that as an American under our Constitution, I have the right to distance myself from anything I consider intolerable.<br>
<br>
<br>
Now onto Caoilfhionn's post, yes this is a two for one special <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Wow such anger and so many rebuts to so many quotes.  I'm glad to see it bothered you that much. Let me just hit on a few of the points you had problems with.<br>
<br>
As far as Jesse Jackson goes, anyone with half of a clue knows that the &quot;Rev&quot; title he carries around is just a front.  In reality this guy is a paid puppet for the, yep you guessed it, the ultra liberals of the democratic party.  He is always ready at the drop of hat, to fly down to some area of the country where the democrats are having problems and stir up racial tensions.  Then the media comes in and covers it like he just won the war against cancer and voila, all of the uninformed, believe everything the media tell us liberals, come charging to the aid of their heroes of the DNC.  That statement had nothing to do with freedom of religion.<br>
<br>
To sum up the gun issue, like I said before, it is the parents duty to see that their children are informed of the dangers of these types of objects and to keep them from accessing them until they are old enough.<br>
<br>
Let me clue you in that picking up a handgun in a split second and killing someone would still take some thought of committing this act before you actually performed your split second attack.  Your statement regarding this was just anger given to you by the mainstream left springing forth without a clue of what was being said.  You saw the word gun and like the good liberal you are, got pissed.<br>
<br>
You also seem to know so much about Adolf Hitler's views but yet you didn't include any reason as to why I was wrong in your reply.  Grasping at a lifeline eh?<br>
<br>
Parents also need to teach their children the difference between fantasy and reality.  One who plays EQ kills many many times daily and yes even kills human characters or each other. Does this make them want to go out and kill the next guy named Altunic Jartin? etc..  If their parents have done their job, no it doesn't,  because they know this is just a game.  They know that fantasy and reality cannot be intermixed in this area.<br>
<br>
<br>
Lastly let me point this tidbit of information out to you.  As all of you have noticed, I have been called a wife beater and uneducated, have been accused of homo fantasies and stereotyped as a lesser person living in a trailer park.(not that people who live in a trailer are lesser people, but that was the implication)  Now suppose someone, let's say a conservative, was to make similar statements concerning their views of liberals as you have labeled me.  Oh how quick you and every other liberal in this country would be to say &quot; what gives you the right to judge me?&quot;, &quot; what gives you the right to call me these things or makes these accusations?&quot;,and to your buddies &quot; what gives them the right to attack our sexual preference?&quot;<br>
<br>
If you must go through life as a liberal, don't do so as a hypocrit. <br>

<br>
I wasn't the slightest big angry, and I'm sure that's clear to most.  I merely made a few points.  I happen to be extremely conservative on some issues and extremely liberal on others.  If you'd read carefully, there are some points where I said that I have some agreement.  <br>
<br>
Being bright enough to make up my own mind, I rarely follow a party line.<br>

<br>
The post said what church is he a reverend for.  I merely pointed out that under the constitution of this country you can worship a frog if that's what you want to do.  Considering what the little I know of Jackson, someone is going to his church, it's my understanding that it's packed on Sundays.  <br>
<br>
As for Hitler, well, I merely pointed out that someone who wants to swing someone to their views doesn't throw out such an obnoxious accusation.  Having some sympathy for gun control issues in no way makes them Hitler.<br>
<br>
And what do I know about Hitler.  Considering the majority of my grandfathers family is deceased as a direct result of his actions and ideas, and I've spent a good portion of my life educated about what happend and why it happened, I can tell you I'm considerably more familiar with it then most. <br>
<br>
I find it highly ironic that you wave your right to be intolerant like a flag, then accuse someone of having Hitlers views on guns.  <br>
<br>
Personally, as I said, I think you're just as entitled to your views as everyone else is.  You just make yourself look foolish when you proclaim your rights to all, but don't want to offer the same rights to anyone else.<br>

<br>
Not really. I could care less if you are angered at anything I post. You see anger in anyone's posts that disagrees with you. Don't you think that's kind of odd?<br>
<br>
My posts are a bit intense at times, but I don't think that's much 'worse' than labeling everyone that disagrees with you a liberal. My joke about you wanting Rush Limbaugh's manboobies was just that... a joke.. and a tie-in to my previous post (many comedians do it, and I do it every now and then for that refreshing burst of naughty humor)! Seriously, man.. cut down on the Rush Limbaugh and WBAP garbage. It'll rot your brain like laced cocaine (which, as irony would have it, is the number one drug of choice for conservative Republicans).<br>
<br>
So what was the purpose of posting the crap? Was it to educate people, or to get a hardon watching us 'liberals' get all 'riled up' at you? Judging by your subsequent posts I would choose the latter without second thought. Gee, speaking of hypocrites........<br>
<br>
Admit it. The little Republican poem is a prod. The author (whoever it is) goes out if his/her way to ensure that every minority, social, and political group is mentioned with red blooded Americans (Republicans) as the heroes, and gays, liberals, democrats, Jews, NRAers, misc minorities, misc religion, and the poor are seen as antagonists. Every group has their own set of problems.. instead of trying to fix them they are simply labeled enemies.<br>
<br>
As far as that little list of ways you can be intolerant.. you're hiding behind that, whereas before the message sounded fairly bold, like you had the right to speak down to others if they were wierd or pissed you off. Good duck 'n cover tornado warning defence!<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> I don't hate the rich. I don't pity the poor.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
You will find very few people that *hate* the rich. The author makes it sound like he loves the rich and detests or has no respect for the poor. Why is this? I'm not saying I disagree with the attitude, but it's just another example of how Republicans are right, and everyone else is wrong. If you notice, they aren't about resolving problems.. they are about rewarding the winners.<br>
<br>
I for one believe that George W. Bush will do nothing but fuck America up as much as possible and do everything and anything his supporters (big business, factories, and oil companies) request. If we are less than 4 trillion more dollars in debt, at least 10% of the ozone remains, only 25% or less are unemployed, and we are not at war with Canada and/or Mexico then I will be fucking elated with joy at the president's 'success' during his reign of stupidity.<br>

I am a white male, hear me roar ! Now, rather than deconstructing this rambling homage to fascism and ignorance ( something about fishing with dynamite =P ), I would rather direct our august poster to a dictionary to look up the word 'liberal' since his use of the word as a perjorative makes it painfully obvious he hasn't the slightest idea it's meaning. <br>
<br>
1. Having, expressing, or following political views or politics that favor civil liberties ( i.e. the Bill of Rights ), democratic reforms ( i.e. voting rights ), and use of social programs to promote social progress.<br>
<br>
2. having, expressing, or following views or policies that favour the FREEDOM to individuals to act or expresss themselves in a manner OF THEIR OWN CHOOSING.<br>
<br>
3. Tolerant of the ideas or behaviour of others; broadminded.<br>
<br>
 Now my question to you Zeph, is which of these definitions offends you so much ?<br>
<br>
<br>
 oh, btw, if you were ever to travel or educate yourself ( not just parrot the vitriol on your radio ), you would know that the phrase is 'Ugly American'.

<br>
Not to take sides but, your knowledge already implies an awareness to the use of liberal as a self claimed title of those who claim to be members of the democrat political party, much in the same way republicans claim the title of conservative, regardless of the fact that the dictionary definitions of none of these words: Liberal, conservative, republican, democrat, or even, while were at it: facist, fit the political parties in question.<br>

By definition, none of us are actually white or black either, but turning to dictionary definitions to discredit someone you disagree with is a bit lame. (thats not really what lame means either.)<br>
