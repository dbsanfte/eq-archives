Got my car back fortunately cause the thief was a moron.  However, as such its made my mom a bit more paranoid then normal.<br><br>2 to 2 1/2 weeks ago, my locks on my door stopped locking.  The door has warped or something too the point that the lock can no longer fit into the slot for it to lock up.  As such, for the last 2 weeks my home has been accessible to anyone bright enough to turn a door knob.<br><br>Luckily, there is always at least 1 person home, however this 3rd person happens to be my little sister of 15.  So if something happens, she's pretty much screwed unless she can get too the phone fast enough.  <br><br>I reported my locks 2 weeks ago, my apartment people have said that its been filed and that they'll get too it as soon as they can, as its taken in the order recieved type @#%$.<br><br>They have found 4 stolen cars in my apartment complex, my car was stolen.  This shows me that thieves wander around my area obviously.  I went back in today, told them my locks are still not working.  They tell me that today or by Monday, course they are off on the weekend.<br><br>By this point, its going to be 3 weeks before my locks are fixed, if...if, they come in by Monday/Tuesday(next week).<br><br>If they dont, I'm going to go back and complain yet again, cept I'm going to get extremely bitchy, as some of you know I can be.  As such, I'd like something to go in with.  <br><br>Other then the obvious moral obligation to insure the safety of their renters or their belongings, is there any legal obligation?  This is annoying me that its taken them well over 2 weeks to get my doors fixed so that I can go to bed at night and know that unless my sister screams for help(as she stays awake at night,  sleeps durin day), I'll be ok and my stuff will still be here.<br><br>Anyone know of anything.  Is there a legal obligation for this?  Please dont assume, if you know cool, if not, then your prolly fit with me on the moral part.  I dislike bothering people, as many can tell you I try to make good with most unless your just a friggin idiot, so I try not too bother them even when there are problems in my apartment that need fixed.  I just try to go with the flow.<br><br>But this @#%$ is gettin ridiculous.<br><br><br>~Slayne <p><br><br><center><img src="http://fgenesis.homestead.com/files/signature.jpg"><br><b>Animation isn't the illusion of life; it is life.</b><br>In Memory of:<br>Chuck Jones<br>1912 - 2002</center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/utoxxthewizard.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Toxx The Wizard</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 602<br> <font color=#E9D756>(7/5/02 4:24:35 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrgeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=10062.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: legal or moral obligation?</span><hr size=1> I'd be very disappointed in our legal system if there is no law against this.<br><br>That just isn't right. =\ <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/utuan00dorf.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tuan00Dorf</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 1422<br> <font color=#E9D756>(7/5/02 4:25:29 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrgeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=10062.topic&index=2>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: legal or moral obligation?</span><hr size=1> Take it to Judge Judy, she'll bust some balls! <p>Tuan {Cupcakes} the Vicar</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ufiesti.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Fiesti</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 102<br> <font color=#E9D756>(7/5/02 4:37:14 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrgeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=10062.topic&index=3>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: legal or moral obligation?</span><hr size=1> I believe each state has different tenant rights, but they dont differ to much.

Unless you have documented proof of the complaints it gets very dificult to file any suits.  They are alotted a reasonable amount of time, but for safety issues I would guess that time passed the first night.  If they aren't there by Monday morning to fix the locks, give them written notice that you will be calling in a lock smith, and deducting the bill from your next months rent.  They are also in violation of your lease, and if you were up to moving, you could terminate your lease for breach of contract.<br><br>Hope that helps<br><br>Foof<br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/usircrombattleaxe.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sir CromBattleAxe</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>CromBattleAxe the Earth Keeper</span><br>  Posts: 331<br> <font color=#E9D756>(7/5/02 4:38:37 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrgeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=10062.topic&index=4>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: legal or moral obligation?</span><hr size=1> There is both a Moral and a legal obligation in this case.<br><br>I would call your local housing authority as well as your local fire department.<br><br>You can have a great amount of fun leading the houseing authority around the property showing them things like rotten siding, dangerous stairways, bushes that block walk ways and most fun of all Locks that dont work.

Keep a copy of the letter. Be sure that your rent is current when the notice is received.<br>2. Your landlord should make a diligent effort to repair the problem within a reasonable time after receipt of the notice. The law presumes seven days to be a reasonable time, but the landlord can rebut this presumption. If the landlord has not made a diligent effort to complete the repair within seven days and you did not have the first notice letter delivered to your landlord via certified mail, return receipt requested, or via registered mail, you will need to send a second notice letter regarding the needed repairs.<br>3. If the landlord still has not made diligent efforts to repair the problem within a reasonable time after receipt of the notice letter sent by certified mail, return receipt requested or by registered mail, you may be entitled to terminate the lease, repair the problem and deduct the cost from your rent, or get a court to order that the repairs be made. You should consult with an attorney before taking any of these actions.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br><br>I can't speak more specifically of your area, but this is fairly common overall. The main differences is going to be what the law considers a &quot;reasonable&quot; time, and if you are allowed to pay out of your pocket for the repair and then remove the amount from your rent.

The lack of a doorlock breaks this obligation (Called the &quot;warranty of habitability&quot; also violates your &quot;right of peaceful enjoyment&quot; which is a part of the prior mentioned warranty)  This is COMMON LAW.

In Georgia, the laws are almost spot on similiar to Texas however a &quot;reasonable time&quot; is not specified. The actual code is very similiar and can be found <a href=http://cses.com/rental/galtlaw.htm>here</a>.<br><br>Once you get beyond the legalese, the landlord is definitely supposed to have the repairs done as soon as possible. If he does not, you can give him written certified notice and have the repair done. If anything happens to your apartment or belongings during the waiting period of getting it fixed (which is in effect even on verbal notice, you can sue for any stolen items etc if they have been at least verbally notified) then they are liable for said items. Since the statute is vague on what constitutes a &quot;reasonable time&quot; I suggest you call the Tenant-Landlord Hotline at 404-206-5343 or 800-369-4706. They should be able to give a closer definition, however I am guessing it probably is 7 days from time of notification.<br><br>Good luck no matter what, and in the meantime maybe you should try to block the door however you can. It sounds silly but if the door opens out, get some rope. If it opens in, a chair under the door might help. Either one is not going to keep a determined person out but it might give you or your sister time to retreat to a safer room and/or call the authorities.<br> <p><br><br><center><br><a href=http://www.stomptokyo.com/movies/wicker-man.html><small><b>I am looking for Rowan Morrison.</b></small></a></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uaoladariraveynfyre.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aoladari Raveynfyre</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 272<br> <font color=#E9D756>(7/7/02 1:40:54 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrgeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=10062.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: legal or moral obligation?</span><hr size=1> I know here in FL. a renter can change the locks as long as the landlord has a key once you move out.

Because a vehicle is property, on their property. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrgeneral.showMessageRange?topicID=10062.topic&start=21&stop=27>2</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrgeneral.showPrevMessage?topicID=10062.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrgeneral.showNextMessage?topicID=10062.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrgeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=10062.topic&index=20><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/gfx/addReply1.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrgeneral.emailToFriend?topicID=10062.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrgeneral.threadControl?topicID=10062.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/deleteThreadFire.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrgeneral.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=10062.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrgeneral.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=10062.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub4.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="emarrmessageboardrules">Message Board Rules<option value="emarrlinks">Links<option value="emarrupcomingmmorpgs">Upcoming MMOG's<option value="emarrfrm18">America Under Attack<option value="emarrfrm19">Dark Age of Camelot<option value="emarrgeneral">General<option value="emarrfrm17">Funny Stuff<option value="emarrbazaar">Item Bazaar<option value="emarrscrollsnspells">Spell Bazaar<option value="emarrfrm15">Shiny Things<option value="emarrfrm14">Bargain Basement<option value="emarrfrm20">Crafter's Hideout<option value="emarrdragonsandplanes">Rants and Flames<option value="emarrfrm13">Dragons and Planes<option value="emarrroleplaying">Roleplaying<option value="emarrroleplayingoocforum">Roleplaying - OOC Forum<option value="emarrscammeralert">Scammer Alert<option value="emarrsignaturecorner">Test Forum<option value="emarrreallife">Real Life<option value="emarrothermmorpgs">Other MMOG's</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#E9D756>- </font><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/bemarr>Erollisi Marr, The Queen of Love</a><font color=#E9D756> - </font><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrgeneral>General</a> <font color=#E9D756> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM GAMES AD SCRIPT --><SCRIPT LANGUAGE="javascript" TYPE="text/javascript" src="http://www.ezboard.com/bravenet/ads04/ads.txt"></script><noscript><div align="center"><iframe src="http://www.ezboard.com/bravenet/ads/eznoscript1.htm" frameborder="0" scrolling="No" width="756" height="117" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" style="border-width:1px; border-color:000000; border-style:solid;"></iframe></div></noscript><!-- END BOTTOM GAMES AD SCRIPT --></CENTER> <br><br><center><font face="Verdana" size="2">Entertaining the Erollisi Marr community since 12/16/99!</font></center><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br> <br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard</a> Ver. 6.9.5.3<br>Copyright 1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
