Thats why I tried to express that everyone has their own way of communiaction whether that be listening or speaking(or writing).  I just expressed an idea.  Kinda like saying&quot; I know you have tried coffee before and it really didn't do anything for you but I really thiink you will like this Hazelnut flavor)  I AM NOT boasting a certain religion/idea   Like I said before and I'll say it again, It does NOT matter (in my opinion) if you 'believe in the existence of God.  We will all know when the time comes(for each person, whenever that may be)  Doesn't matter   doesn't matter  doesn't matter    believe what you want to.  I don't believe God loves me better than Triff or any other 'atheist'  or, like i said earleir,  even the worst person who ever lived.  Let me ask you guys a question;  think of the person you love,  now think to yourselves, what is more important, &quot;my recognition of the physicall existence of that person OR the realtionship I have with them??  I would never ask you if you believed in this friend of yours.  SOUNDS obvious to you but I bet some peps could scientifically PROVE that what you are seeing in that 'person' you love soo much is a delusion or a form of symbolic logic created by your brain.  THAT same person could tell you, &quot;hey man, you and everyone else are nothing but a big bag of chemicals.  Nothing in your life is real, not even the love you have for your mother, father, sidter, brother, friend, dog, cat or whatever&quot;  IT CAN BE PROVEN SCIENTIFICALLY.  <br>
<br>
     So anyway I was telling Triff (in a very round about way, of which I did not want to throw all this info at him at once-with regards to possibly thrashing the info/idea (what the hell ever) I gave/suggested to him.  IN A NUTSHELL.  Faith is a tool.  A compass.  ( AND TRIFF--when you ahve kids you will know/feel when they are about to get into shit, TRUST ME)  FAITH allows me to explore the realm of my spirituality in new areas.  IT is not the only reason I believe in God.  It IS(not sure for every person in the world but it is for me) necassary as a foundation for creating a relationship with God  (JUST LIKE it is for your friends/parents/siblings--very similar)  The answer to all this and most everyhting in the world is not so black and white, and easy to explain.  ANOTHER 'thing' that has improved my relationship with God is 'asking for the knowledge'.  I DON&quot;T know and don't claim to know if realtionship with God is same for all peps.  In fact I think it is prob very different. Kinda like how I prefer to speak to different peps differently.  (Peps have different lines of communication)  This 'asking for the knowledge stuff' is a real part of my relationhip wth God(Just as giving a hug or smiling or loving someone close to you was and is.  Same thing.  Its just a relationship.  Call it real or not.  If its not then I need to market this drug cause its some good shit.

<br>
Brutas, faith isn't a foundation for relationships with people. There's really not much more I have to say on that subject, beyond saying that if you come up with an example where you'd say I'm having faith in another person, I will tell you, &quot;In that case I choose not to have faith, and instead judge the results by probability.&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ulukariatrueheart.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lukaria Trueheart</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 72<br> <font color=#E9D756>(11/30/01 10:07:57 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: My Response to the Last Three Posts</span><hr size=1> Triff, sorry for delaying in answering, I've been busy.  You asked why I chose the Christian God.  Quite an involved question, but I'll do my best to be quick at the answer.<br>
<br>
Before I do - one thing.  Science does NOT = reality.  Science is knowledge gained by observation, experimentation, and study in order to determine the nature of what is being studied.  Reality is what is real - what is fact.  My reality is not yours.  I believe God exists.  You do not.  Both facts.   Who is right?  Regardless, God is supernatural.  Not natural.  How do you scientifically study the supernatural?  As best you can.  And I think many have done the best they can with the existence of God.  There is no absolute scientific evidence of either the existence or the non-existence of God.  Its all in what you choose to believe after examining the evidence.<br>
<br>
Now, onward to your question.<br>
<br>
I was raised Catholic - hated it, hated everything about it.  Thought of God as this being up there with a tally sheet marking down everytime I lied so that he could send me to hell.  Also, my Gram talked about the Devil **gasp** like he was real.  Freaked me out.  I mean yeah I wanted to believe in a God, but not a Devil who might want to hurt me.  Needless to say - turned away from the church quite early I did.<br>
<br>
Went to camp at 14, became a Christian there.  Why?  Because there was something missing in my life that no one could fill.  Not mom or dad, not other guys, not friends, not even myself.  I kept thinking to myself  &quot;this cannot be all there is.&quot;  I mean, whats the point of living I thought, if you just keel over in 50 years and get eaten by worms?  Also, I liked the fellowship there.  The acceptance.  The love.  I found myself wanting to be a part of that community.<br>
<br>
I was able to keep that for a couple years, then went to college, and lost the fellowship, which really, I lost my path too.  I had no fellowship, I didn't study the Bible.. my fiancee didn't believe in God even.<br>
<br>
Fast forward.  Serious personal issues arise in marraige.  Marraige almsot breaks down, I ask for a divorce.  My husband after 30 years of non-belief finds a chuch, becomes a Christain.  Took him almost two years, but I finally believed that he really had changed.  For him, it was because of his relationship with God.<br>
<br>
I started going to church again.  I renewed my realtionship with God, and now am &quot;walking&quot; with God as we call it, studying and developing.<br>
<br>
I can honestly say, God saved me years ago, God saved my marraige through my husband's prayer and patience and change, God has given me all that I cherish.<br>
<br>
That explains why God.  Its all experience and emotions, yeah.  My husband's decision was NOT on emotion, neither was a close friend's... theirs was based on research, which I helped with.  I also had questions.<br>
<br>
Now, why the Christian God out of all the religions/Gods currently out there?<br>
<br>
Jesus is the only one who offers forgiveness.  Thats the simple answer.<br>
<br>
I<br>
ll elaborate a teeny bit more now.<br>
<br>
I don't want to quote bible verses at you, but obviously, I believe in God, and in the fall, and in the need for forgiveness in order to be with God.  Without that forgiveness, I would be judged by God when I die.  I don't want to be judged, I know that I fall far short.  I'd be in Hell for sure!  Yeah, we all think the line where hell begins is always right below where we are, no matter what we are doing.  We don't think we need forgiveness.  But!  Jesus offers not only forgiveness, but bridges the gap between God and all humans that occurred with the fall.  God's nature is immutable.  He is love and patience, he is also just, judging, holy, and righteous.  I personally, do not want to be without God in this life or in eternity.  Jesus makes it so that I do not have to be.  His forgiveness clears me of all sin, always.  And let me tell you - what a damn relief that is!  <br>
<br>
No other God, no other religion offers this.<br>
<br>
Should I say that again?<br>
<br>
The Christian God is the only one that offers this free gift of forgiveness.  No hoops to jump through, no changes to make before doing it, no restictions. Just a decision and a small prayer, asking God to come into your heart.  Read rev 3 :20 (i think) Behold, I stand at the door and knock..    that one.  <br>
<br>
Judiasm and Islam are the other monotheistic religions.  Both believe Jesus was a prophet, neither believe he was the messiah, come to take away the sins of the world.  Judiasm is still waiting.  Neither offer a free gift of forgiveness.<br>
<br>
Most of the other major religions are pantheistic, polytheistic, or even animalistic.  Looking critically at all of the religions, Christianity (for me and for many) offers the best answers, the best solutions, and evidence I find compelling.  These other religions sometimes offered answers, but often they did not.  Not for sin, or evil, or suffering, or values, or love, or morals, or even existence itself.<br>
<br>
In addition, after asking God into my life and pursuing a relationship with Him, I have seen incredible changes.  Both in my life and in others.  <br>
<br>
There is so much more I could say, but I believe I answered your question.<br>
<br>
In summary, no other God, no other religion, offers freely a gift of forgiveness to all humankind that brings us into a relationship with God as it was meant to be.  <br>
<br>
I want the relationship, I want the forgiveness (that one time boon - Jesus has paid our Debt in Full for all time for us - for free, every sin I've ever committed or do commit or will commit).  <br>
<br>
It is the only religion that made sense to me.<br>
<br>
It says in the bible actually, that to the unbeliever, God's words will sound as foolishness.  It sounds too good to be true in many people's opinions, but it really is the truth.  I firmly believe that.  If you choose not to listen or believe, that is your absolute free choice.  I do believe it is an eternal choice though.<br>
<br>
Yeah, ok flame me for a God-loving bible thumper.  Proud to be so!<br>
<br>
Have a great day.<br>

Lukaria that is one of the lamest dumb ass statements of the century!! So, let me see. If I observe, study, and prove by experimentation that Buffy my lap dog sheds hairs I have squat! It is not reality that Buffy my lap dog shed hair? Lukaria you are a dumb shit!<br>
<br>
Now to brighten your day Lukaria! Science is truly the study of what is real and what is fact. You want to talk about "reality" then you better get a little more dryer behind your ears. I suggest you actually finish school Lukaria. It might even be good to drop EQ to read those books you might not be reading so you can game! Are you 15 Lukaria?

<br>
I would say, Triff, that forgiveness for my sins does not equal immorality, nor is there a relief of responsibility at all.  <br>
<br>
Lets discuss that further.<br>
<br>
A great place to read about this is Corinthians beginning in Chapter 5 (if you have access to a bible you can read this yourself, read through chapter 7).  This section is written by Paul, whom many probably know was a murderer.  He became a Christian and was forgiven his sins.  It is written to the Corinthians, who are believers and have been saved, but they are leading horridly immoral lives.  Paul tells them that though lawful to him, not all things are profitable.  He also tells them not to judge those outside of the faith, but we can judge those within the faith i.e. if someone is an immoral Christian and will not repent, and will not give up that which is immoral, he can be removed from the fellowship of the church. <br>
<br>
So, point one.  All things are lawful but not all things are profitable.<br>
<br>
Here is what is at the heart of your question.  When you accept Christ into your heart, you are &quot;born again&quot; so to speak into the Christian life.  Your sins are erased forever, as they have been paid by Christ himself .  In the bible, it says that those who have been born again no longer are &quot;under the law.&quot;  Now, basically what this means is that we no longer live under the yoke of making sacrifice/penance to God in order to atone for our sins.  i.e. when you sinned in the old testament, you made a sacrifice to God to atone for it (you killed a lamb or something ).  Jesus though is the ultimate sacrifice.  His sacrifice, of his own life for us, has paid the debt for all time. <br>
<br>
Not being under the law means that the old testament sins, for example, do not apply to us in relation to <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> God’s view of us</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.  This means that’s though we need to obey God and live a moral life, we invariably will fall short and sin, but that will not be held against us.  It does not change our standing in God’s eyes if we are “saved.”  Not being under the law means that even though we sin, if we ask forgiveness, we shall not be held accountable for those sins on our day of judgment because <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Jesus has already done that - he has taken all the sins upon Himself for us</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.  When we stand before God, our sins already will have been atoned for.  <br>
<br>
Does this mean that I could for example - have an affair?  Sure I suppose it could.  I would be forgiven for it, technically speaking - it would not bar my path to Heaven ultimately.  But I know that is wrong and is immoral.  Doing so would not only likely destroy much of my marriage (which is newly back together) and rip my family apart, but would also create huge feelings of guilt and self-hatred within me, and impede my spiritual growth.  This is NOT a profitable life to lead.  So though it might be lawful, it is not profitable.  In other words, Paul says, you'd be saved still if you did this, but you'd ruin your life - so why do it?<br>
<br>
This brings up the second point:  the Church could judge me.  If I had an affair and continued to have an affair and lead an immoral life, and I refused to repent after repeated attempts by the church to help me, the church could actually judge me and kick me out, thereby refusing me the fellowship of other Christians.  It is within their right to do so.  That doesn't mean the church will judge, but that they can judge, because I am a believer in Christ.  If I was not a believer, they would have no basis for judging me.<br>
<br>
Also consider the following points:<br>
<br>
God reads your heart.  Do you honestly think that God could not penetrate your heart and see if you are really sincere when asking him into your life?  If a murderer asks God into His heart, but with only an outward show of piety and an inward calculation (&quot;Gee, let me ask God into my heart and then I'll still go to heaven even though I've murdered 100 people), God WILL see that.  You must be sincere.<br>
<br>
Also consider this : once you sincerely ask God into your life, the Holy Spirit then becomes a guiding force in your life.  Yes, you can ignore it, but its very hard.  That is why so many people who honestly pursue relationships with God have so many wonderful changes in their lives.    <br>
<br>
This is not to say that we (Christians) never sin.  In fact, we do sin.  Just like everyone else on this earth, I am still a human with all that fallen nature implies (carnal and otherwise).  I still fall far short of perfection.  That’s why Christians should be the LAST people to judge others (non-believers), we know though, that often is not the case.  I feel that it is not my role to judge, that is God's role.  It is my job to become as much like Christ as I can, full of love and serving my fellow man, and spreading the good news.  <br>
<br>
That should answer your questions about moral responsibility, I hope.<br>
<br>
Now to the last part.  Why is forgiveness required.  Forgiveness is required in two different phases.  In this life, forgiveness is required in order to have a relationship with God.  God is a righteous being, and we cannot have contact with Him unless our sins are “made right” or atoned for.  In the next life, forgiveness of sins is required in order to dwell in heaven with God.  Again, He is a righteous and Holy being and will NOT allow evil into Heaven.  Your sins must be atoned for in order for you to be allowed in.  Sins, in God’s eyes are evil and a sinful person will not be allowed into contact with him or allowed to dwell in heaven with him.  Jesus, by being the ultimate sacrifice, atoned for ALL our sins for all time.  All you have to do is ask him into your heart and believe he did indeed die for your sins.  When God looks at me, Jesus stands there and takes all my sins onto Himself, so that God sees a righteous person.  <br>
<br>
Now, as to is this a big selling point.  You’d think it would be, wouldn’t you?  The thing is, when you talk like I have above most people think you’re crazy, that you are a religious fanatic, they see you as uncool, a weirdo, a freak.  First off, to them it sounds like mumbo jumbo, obviously you have to study the bible and really get into the word so that you can understand it.  The bible is not light reading.  Secondly, it sounds too good to be true.  They look at me and say “ you mean all I have to do is believe Jesus died for my sins, and sincerely ask God into my heart, and all my sins are forgiven?”  The answer is yep.  And it sounds too good for them.  Why would Jesus do that for them?  Where is the catch?  The answer is simple.  There is no catch.  Its free.  And God did it because He loves you, and wants you with Him.<br>
<br>
So, I hope I’ve done well.  I am sure I got a few things wrong here and there, but I certainly hope you were able to read and understand what I wrote.  Like I said,  a lot of people will think its total mumbo jumbo.<br>
<br>
If you have serious further questions regarding this, why don’t you email me? Lukaria@hotmail.com.  It is much easier to discuss over email than in a message board forum.  Its also easier for me to add links to pertinent information, and/or refer to someone more knowledgeable.<br>
<br>
I also must caution – I am by not means an expert.  I think I got all this correct.  Also, remember that many people, even Christians would disagree with me on a few points.  This is all simply my opinion from study and discussion.  A mature Christian of 20 years would probably be a better person to answer you.  In addition, I want to assure you I don’t intend to come across as arrogant or pompous or all-knowing or holier than thou.  If I do at all, it assuredly is an honest mistake and I apologize.  I simply find discussion of this quite intriguing and am delighted to be able share my love for God and the gospel.<br>
<br>
Have a terrific day.<br>

Brutas, that would be fine. My view of what is real will be very close to Physicalism. There are many flavors of the view. Suffice it to say that all that exists can be described in terms of the physical world. Science will of course play an important role in my view as well as Rationalism when it comes to evaluating statements about the world. <p>Lurikeen Mali'Kyre<BR>

Lukaria, the problem is not so much with your definition as it was with the &quot;logic&quot; you presented. You concluded:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> &quot;]&quot;Science does NOT = reality&quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Your conclusion doesn't even remotely follow from the dictionary definitions you provided. I think what you wanted to say was something more like &quot;Science involves many disciplines of study about the world and should not itself be taken to stand for reality.&quot; But, if that is what you meant the statement itself is not terribly informative. I think everyone could agree with that. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>Lurikeen Mali'Kyre<BR>

Reference them, please. As for proving that it isn't all an illusion; I used to have a much better argument for this but I've forgotten it at the moment, but I can still say that if I just sat motionless, waiting for proof either way, I would die. I take in what I see around me and act accordingly. It's pretty self-evident and simple.<br>
<br>
You know, this is somewhat obvious, but I only just now realized and named this thought.. The reason it's inevidable that humans will &quot;sin&quot; is because your definition of sinning is not based on the actual nature of human beings, it's based on what The Master wants you to do. We weren't meant to be slaves. This is why it is difficult to follow something else's will—not because humans are evil, but because our nature is not defined by service.<br>
<br>
And Lurikeen, while this won't prove much to you, I think that you having a deep-seated hatred of religion (of anything) is good evidence that somewhere along your line of thinking, something is irrational. High-gushing anger is usually the result of that. When you've rationally thought out your view of life, anger isn't what you feel so much as just plain indifference.

Nice jab, Triff! :)  The fact of the matter is I do not hate religions at all. In fact, I have just had a family member of mine convert to Christianity and he gave me a call on the phone to tell me how wonderful it is. What did I do? I congratulated him on his new found joy. What I HATE, Triff, is the ARROGANCE of many Evangelical Christians. I have as yet to dish out the same treatment to Brutas as to what I have given to Lukaria (which I will no longer be "dishing out" period!). Brutas doesn't come off with the idea that all us poor "sinners" are in need of his brand of salvation. Sure he would be happy if all were god fearing believers such as himself, but he doesn't solicit his beliefs. I have a tremendous amount of respect for that. Evangelical Christians use their beliefs like a whore on the street corner to bring people in contact with "the Lord Jesus". I absolutely despise such behaviors.<br>
<br>
BTW, I have "rationally" thought out my life, and have found that there is no amount of rational thinking that can discount emotional content. While I am a rational agent I am also a very passionate one at that. :) Triff, there is nothing wrong with passion. Telling someone to fuck off a die will certainly not be beneficail, will make the recipient of the verbal abuse hate you most likely, but is a genuine expression of self. Indeed, I have met so many "rationalists" like myself who have found that reason can only go so far and then we must fall upon emotional content to complete ourselves. Atheists and Christians alike laugh aloud when I tell them I am a man of "faith". When I run out of reasonable answers to my questions I have to sometimes haul off and simply believe something to be the case. ;) I hope I have answered your questions. <p>Lurikeen Mali'Kyre<BR>

Brutas, sorry I missed your post somehow. I think you have made an interesting point. I would like to add that there are 3 types of relationships you have included in your post. 1) Logical relationships: If A = B and B = C, then A = C; 2) Physical relationships: A bumps into B; 3) Pyschological relationships: A loves B. Some argue that 2 and 3 really are the same. At any rate, *relationships* come to play in Metaphysics when talking about 1 and 2 above, and I think rarely 3. If A loves B, then there is no question that A has some sort of logical or physical relationship with B. Now which is more important than the other? I think that 3 wins hands down. I could really care less if the world is another's dream (an illusion), or the figment of my imagination (Solipsism) or ultimately physical. To me emotion is very powerful and is what counts day to day. When I die I will not be asking if the world is real. I will be asking for those people I love be they imaginary or real. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>Lurikeen Mali'Kyre<BR>

I completely agree.  However, its probably that we might call it two or three different things.  Personally, I believe that 'true' perception or 'oneness' if you will, is a result of the union of love and truth, and once this union is thouroughly achieved, (this is only a theory) We move on towards the next step which is a union with God(a kind of 'bond' if you will) [I know that sounds a bit backwards from the 'Christianity' thing, whereby people think the only thing important in life is to make sure you are 'saved'].  Yes I believe in afterlife.  I believe in God.  I believe that I'm cool with him and all that.  I believe I am 'saved'.  BUT, I want more out of my life and relationship/union with God.  While the union of this relatioship is 'key' IMO, I continually work to understand.  I am not a walking zombie and will never be one.  THAT is why I see the beauty in what others say/do.  THERE is more to life than my piddly brain.   Quote Lurikeen-   &quot;Some argue that 2 and 3 really are the same&quot;   I COMPLETELY agree.  Here is how I see that statement:  Love=1 Truth=2 and spirituality=3.  Love is obvious and so is Truth.   Spirituality(IMO), as the 'union' of these two, travels beyond, or transcends the 'ignorance of 'love' and the arrogance of 'truth'.  PLEASE allow me to explain that in simple terms.  Truth, without love is arrogant.  Love without truth is ignorant.  There is a 'necassary' balance between the two.  This 'perfect' balance is spirituality.  <br>
     Now, that statement, definetly asks this so-called term, 'perfection', to tear it to pieces.  BUT IMO, perfection is not a judgement of truth(thought, whatever ya call it) as most people percieve it to be.  THIS is the temptation of our 'scientific' revolution.  I think science is wonderful and believe that it is a necassary component of our evolution(that word not meant physically).

What am I saying about &quot;existence&quot;? Not much really. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Let me seperate out two ideas I have and please knock them around a bit. There is no such thing as &quot;Existence&quot; in and of itself. There are worlds that contain things (like you and I) and one of those worlds is the *actual* world (btw, a &quot;world&quot; is simply a collection) and all the rest of them are &quot;possible worlds&quot;. What is actual is what is real and what exists. The actual world is that which contains instances of logically possible concepts. For example, the actual world doesn't contain an instance of a &quot;round-square&quot; because that is not possible; in fact, &quot;round-squares&quot; are not even real. However, the concept &quot;human being&quot; does have instances. Human beings are both real and exist. That is to say the concept is coherent and there is an instance of it. Let me toss this out while I am here.... The concept of &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot; is coherent. So, Sherlock is real, but does he exist? As far as we know there are no instances of the concept anywhere, so the easy answer is he does not exist.<br>
<br>
Concerning the remainder of your post, you have some well thought out ideas. I agree that passion must walk alongside the dryness of truth. I also agree that when one attempts to lose emotional content (what you refer to as &quot;spirituality&quot;) they have lost out. At the end of reason are two types of people, in my opinion: 1) dead ones 2) living one. Those who keep passion in their lives are alive.<br>

I will not leave aside what you are writing about &quot;perfection&quot; until you can elaborate more on the topic. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>Lurikeen Mali'Kyre<BR>

Something with no mistake.  The thing I imagined when I wrote that last sentence was a marble sphere.  Perfectly smooth until I noticed a tiny bump.  Then it lost perfection.  SO, perfection is the judgement of something/someone using analytical thinking as a tool.  And the result of 'perfection' is relieving as it provides a conclusion of some type of chaos.  Perfection is an example of control over the 'system' called life(or whatever that is)  Being human and being bound by nature, I am part of this 'system' which is constantly moving, only stopping when it reaches 'perfection' then moving onto its next growing stage.  (this is all 'time' based process)  IMO its not the result which is to be judged, it is the process.  In a world where we can 'choose' to be part of the system, perfection will be always.  Not perfection of the marble sphere, but its whole process.  It is all perfect.  We just don't recognize it because we a bound by it.  Oh shit I hope that made sense.  I'm tired as all hell.  So going beyond this 'system' is achieving perfection.  How, can we go beyond it?  By achieving the 'perfect' balance of love and truth. <br>

Yep I completely agree and this is why I feel so strongly about God, Jesus, after life and all that.  People fear God beacuse they think they won't be able to feel.  WHen in fact that would be far from making any sense to a being who has made us with the idea of friendship.  I am not going to be walking around like some zombie creating the perfect marble sphere and farming my lot.  Where is the balance of love and truth there?  There isn't one.  Yep, without feelings what is there to live for.  There would be no free will.  It just doesn't make any sense.  Everything is important.  Everything will be involved.  I believe there are so many enjoyable things in society that have been perverted by people.  People then wonder, &quot;will i be able to fuck my wife in the mouth in heaven?&quot;  well, if sodomizing your wife is a balnce of love and truth then I guess so.  Will it be like sex, drugs and rock'n'roll?  No cause there is no balance there either(truth gone out the window).  Will there be feelings which equate with sex, music, celebration etc.... yea there will.  They just won't be sodomizing your wife.  Will I be sticking my cock in someone's poop-shoot?  Well, I don't now and don't intend on it anytime.  Will exciting sex exist.  Sure it will.  Passion will be the rule of thumb rather than lust.  Lust is a perverse form of love.  Will I play computer games.  Hmm I think we will be forever inventing things, searching, exploring this universe and the next(yea scientists agree that there are, not only millions of galaxies but more universes out there as well).  Do I believe the universe will be occupied and explored.  Well I think I am rambling now.  I hope I answered your question with clarity Lurikeen.  <br>
