<br>
Usually, RPP works when people feel like &quot; i have paid my dues and havent gotten crap to show for it !!!&quot;.<br>
<br>
IE, they are tired of seeing others win stuff  who dont raid as much as they do.<br>
<br>
Bonuses to RPP system.<br>
<br>
1. Everyone can purchase any item they have rpp for, within the constraints of the system.  No more &quot; this doesnt fit your class BEST &quot;.<br>
<br>
2. Encourage participation for members who might not want to go help on things where they dont have a chance at benifit ( ie epic raids where the job is to kill the mob and there is no loot ).<br>
<br>
3. Let members have clearly defined expectations of how fast they might or might not get loot.<br>
<br>
4. Make the guild in general stronger, as the members who raid the most ( ie put in the most effort ) WILL get the items.  Sorta like the republican &quot;trickle down&quot; theory.<br>
<br>
Negative aspects <br>
<br>
1. Focuses a guild on loot, and encourages members to focus on the loot aspect of the game.<br>
<br>
2. Acknowledges that there are members in your guild who might not participate in something if nothing is in it for them.. ie they wont go just to help a friend.<br>
<br>
3. Fosters resentment if you have members who for whatever reason cant play as much as they want to.. thus end up with negative RPP and no hope of ever getting anything on things they DO participate in.<br>
<br>
4. headache for SOMEONE to administer.<br>
<br>
5. Loot can go to someone's twink who raids alot, even if a &quot; main &quot; is there at the event and could use the item<br>
<br>
<br>
I personally find the idea of RPP distasteful, HOWEVER, i understand WHY the guilds that do it, do it.  It works for those guilds who are focused on raiding.  IMO, it will NOT work in guilds who profess a &quot; family &quot; atmosphere.<br>
<br>
One of the definitions of &quot; family &quot; guilds is one where members are not forced to attend any particular event, and have equal chances at items on the ones they DO attend.<br>
<br>
It is this reason family guilds normally fall behind raid guilds in equipping members, even when they have the level to do so ( no forced participation = less raiding, which = less gear for their members .. or gear aquired at a slower pace ).<br>
<br>
Also, Tani's explanation is also valid, in that assigning RPP to something a member could do with a group doesnt work.<br>
<br>
The only thing that bothers me about RPP in relation to the rest of the lanys community, is that many times people in RPP guilds will take advantage of those in NON rpp guilds to aquire loot without &quot; paying &quot; for it.<br>
<br>
You will see people in an RPP guild trying to solicit help for something like Phinny in kedge, where they could take it out with one group NP ( many non rpp guilds can as well ).  They will try to organize people from out of guild so they dont pay rpp for it.  I see this alot, and think of people trying to skirt their own system that is set up for them.  Sometimes they go on raids that are NON rpp to skirt their system too.. when they could just as easily set up a raid in their guild ( but then have to pay rpp ).<br>
<br>
They should just suck it up and pay the rpp, since that is the system they choose to play in.<br>
<br>

I have a feeling that an RPP type of system is the only way to keep a large number of self-directed players to function as a group for any extended period of time without serious fragmentation. <p><center><img src="http://www.darke.net/journalpix/bearne.jpg"><BR>

It was quite easy to manage  necessitating only to enter the time / mob of a raid and to click checkboxes beside the members that were present (which was quite easy if done on a 2nd comp while raid was in progress).  It could also be made to be able to parse a snippet of eqlog.txt for people in the RPP members list that are present in the zone from a /who command.  It also allowed to sort by any column ascending or descending.  Listing by descending current RPP made it very easy to find which of those people that sent tells are in the top 5  of the highest person that wanted the item.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Twinks:</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  In CQ a person could use RPPs towards any 55+ character they owned.  Characters under 55 could get RPP items ONLY if they were going to rot (lower priority than a negative player).<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Family guilds:</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  As much as a family guild might say that people are not forced to attend raids, in most of them they are.  Family guilds are generally formed of a smaller number of people (because the more people you add the more they won't all feel like a family with everyone else) so key people aren't easily replaceable (like say your only epic cleric, or only necro that can use SC coffins, or your only planar wizard, etc etc).  If they miss raids thus forcing the others to either cancel a raid or make the raid much harder to execute (like the headache of SCing 20 people with large coffins) resentments WILL appear.  People will be either forced by peer pressure to attend or even if sentiments remain unspoken it will eventually create rifts between people.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Exploiting nonRPP people:</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  There's two parts to this.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> 1.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->About doing your own nonRPP raids to get RPP items:  Too easy to get items are not given RPP values.  For harder ones under CQ rules you WILL be charged the value of whatever you got even if it was completely with out of guild people.  If you try to make the raid in secret and it's found out it's highly frowned upon.  And in any sizable guild things like this are easily found out.  Exceptions to this can be made at the guild leader's discretion depending on the circumstances.  For example someone buying a RPP item with pp in ECom, having a RPP item MQed from a friend or a guild-friend (see explanation below what these are) getting say their epic with their base guild, or on a nonRPP raid because we don't have the time to get it for them in the near future.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> 2.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->About inviting nonRPP people to RPP raids:  Generally nonRPP members are not invited to raids, one of the goals and strengths of an uberguild being to be self sufficient.  However there are what we call &quot;guild-friends&quot;.  These people have an unlimited open invite to any and all raids and are members of the RPP system (they are technically members except for lack of guildchat, no access to things such as ST keys and ability to be part of a different guild while raiding with us).  On the rare ocassion that people who are not members of the RPP system are needed for a specific raid and an item they can use drops then a weighted roll between the RPP system and that person happens.  For example say we raided Dragon X and UberClericOnlyBP drops.  We had a total of 10 clerics attend, 8 that are members or guild-friends and 2 that we needed to invite from the outside.  Of the 8 RPP member clerics 5 need the items.  Both nonRPP clerics need the item.  A roll is made: 1-5 RPP ststem, 6 NonRPPCleric01, 7 NonRPPCleric02.  If one of the 2 outside clerics wins the item it's theirs.  If the RPP system wins the items it is distributed to the 5 RPP clerics that needed it according to RPP rules. <p><a href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/players/view_profile.asp?Id=18807" target="CRProfile" alt="Yunna's Profile" title="Yunna's Profile"><img src="http://www.conquest-guild.com/members/yunna/sig2001.jpg" border="0" alt=" "></a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ucakvalasc.showPublicProfile?language=EN>CakValaSC</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I live here.... get out.</span><br> <font color=#000033>(1/7/02 8:24:53 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: RPP/Raid Point information.</span><hr size=1> what happens when a guild kills everything.. and theres nother knew to kill? =/ <p><div align="center">
