The monk Xille walked up and began KS'ing my roomate....I showed up, tried to talk xille into leaving, since obviously he was in the wrong, and I was threatened with a 54 necro...I promptly grabbed acid, ran to HHK (while Soulcollector 54 necro guildless gnome) ran from oasis to KS from a group of newbies because his twink couldn't take any spawns. I buffed the group and sat around basically PL'ing them for awhile, then left to help my wife with some things in Sro.  Soulcollector tried going anon, but when Xille logged I kept doing a /who all necro 54 =).<br>
<br>
After about half an hour of soulcollector KS'ing from this orc group, he sends me a tell, &quot;I am here&quot;  I said, &quot;That's nice&quot;  So, he continues killing orcs from the orc group, and I begin to talk reason with him.  &quot;Even if it WAS your twink's camp...Xille camped. The camp now belongs to the group there.  Now, why would I come to HHK to STOP you from childishly killing orcs from the orc group out of some jealous/immature rage?  If I showed up and made sure you got no kills, what would that accomplish? Nothing but the orc group STILL not getting any kills.&quot;<br>
<br>
Anyhow, he was petitioned, and i don't know if it was the GM, or if he left of his own bored accord, but he was &quot;suddenly nice and left&quot;.  So I hear from the orc group of friends I made =) I've had an almost not so pleasant experience with steelfists also...but I called him a dirty twink and he calmed down =)<br>
<br>
Acid.<br>

I just think we need less twink/prick monks and more twink beastmasters.  /nod <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ushoumai.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Shoumai</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>p0\/\/3r-p0sT3r!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(5/8/01 1:33:18 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=500.topic&index=22>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Xille</span><hr size=1> LMAO,<br>

Soullcollector was that stupid asshole who has been kicked out of two different HH orc groups, the first was pretty silly(he kept argueing the stats of an item one person was wearing, then got all kinds of abusive when he was proved wrong).  The second he kept his pet parked under the orc spawn, pulling way to many mobs to us, after he was asked not to, he again became abusive so he got kicked out, he then began to spam the zone with ni**er this and whore that.  I was kinda hopin he'd have been banned, but that was back in the high teens.  Nice to know this dickhead hasn't changed at all. <p><a href="http://jofus73.homestead.com/files/sakki.jpg

Yesterday, he would just come to the guard room in high pass where i was a part of a full group and attack the MOBs that we were fighting. Now, while he was not talking any experience from us and therefore no doing anything illegal, he was not welcome by our group and should not have been there in the first place. i definitely agree with Numnayven, who, by the way is one of the most noble people i have played with in eq. People like that should just be avoided, and that is why there is The Shit List - to warn people of players such as Steelfists Offury. On the other hand the fact that they left for only 2 minutes does tell me that you sow an opportunity and took it without real concern for whether the spot was camped or not. High Pass Hold is an outdoor zone, therefore wolf-form could have been casted on them anywhere in it, even downstairs in front of the bank - where it probably was. Using /ooc to camp check is always a good idea to prevent things like that from happening. Also i would have given them the spot back just because in my opinion that would be right. Although Steelfists in kinda of an asshole =)<br>

I wander through here occasionally, and dont really like to post at all. I think moderator, time to put this one to bed. At least prevent from posting here those who obviously have nothing worthwhile to say other than engaging in puerile squabbles and end up looking like likely candidates for this place themselves. <p><html>
