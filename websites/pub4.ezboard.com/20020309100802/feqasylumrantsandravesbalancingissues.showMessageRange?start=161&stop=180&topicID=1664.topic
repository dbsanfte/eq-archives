BUT if it makes you feel good then it will be worth it. People forget that, the person doing the giving gets as much out of it as the person recieving. Being generous has its rewards. I hope you dont feel bad though when you realize this char didnt deserve such kindness.<br>
<br>
I use to bartend, this guy would come in every day and spend hours buying pitchers of beer. His job was to stand on the corner and hold a sign saying he was a vet who was homeless and he would work for food. Well people gave him cash. He did indeed get a check from social security and was never a vet. He was not homeless, he was just an alcholic and the social security was not enough to support his drinking habits. This was over 5 yrs ago, I still work downtown and see him a few times a week on the same corner. So.... even though he is lying, I am sure many who gave him money felt good that they helped a homeless veteran and that feeling can be priceless. I am sure if I went and told many of them where he spends their money, they would be disappointed and some maybe wouldnt believe me. Veeta reminds me of this guy. Personally I did still feel some compassion for him, I would never want to trade places with the guy. He gave his life to the bottle, that in itself is rather sad.<br>
<br>
So, ask yourself this question, &quot;If I find out after I help him that veeta was just a scammer, will I regret the help I gave?&quot; If the answer is you will regret it, then maybe you should reconsider helping him. If you wont regret it and are willing to take the chance that he is indeed scamming you, then help him out. That way you wont end up having regrets. <p><center><img src="http://www.danos.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/jellah.gif" width="577" height="162"></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uvenen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Venen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Boardaholic</span><br> <font color=#000033>(2/10/02 9:50:26 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumrantsandravesbalancingissues.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1664.topic&index=163>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.crocker.com/~denise/amflag.gif  WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Heh</span><hr size=1> I'm not sure where it was said that he had actually FOUND the body and was looking for a rez?  Either way that's beside the point IMO.  Honestly it sounds to me like she didn't want anyone going out of her way for her, and probably didn't realize that the officer was that close to getting her corpse.  After all, we all want our corpses, even the greediest scammers out there.  <br>
<br>
I'm willing to go either way here, but the only evidence I've seen thus far is &quot;she types l33t!&quot;.  Innocent until proven guilty (note the &quot;proven&quot;).  If it even LOOKED like she was scamming, I might question myself on it, but to me it just looks like she wanted some help, and people got pissed... thought she was beggar, and ragged on her for no reason... and in order to justify themselves they tried everything possible to make her look like a scammer, sorry but that doesn't work for me.<br>
<br>
I'm not arguing this for public attention, if I was I probably would have started this with a full rant instead of a simple &quot;If you need equip please contact me in-game Veeta&quot;.  But people chose to read into that, and I explained myself.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uvenen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Venen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Boardaholic</span><br> <font color=#000033>(2/10/02 9:53:59 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumrantsandravesbalancingissues.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1664.topic&index=164>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.crocker.com/~denise/amflag.gif  WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Heh</span><hr size=1> Interesting story, however in that case it was proven that he lied in order to get something.

That was about five minutes after that Officer started looking, mind you. He could not tell where he had died in OT as well.<br>
<br>
So either he was scamming here about having died in OT, or he really doesn't care about the gear on it. Since the next best f00l would be kind enough to give him new gear anyway. THAT is the value he attaches to his gear.<br>
<br>
Either way, it makes him look bad. If you want to go and give him whatever, be my guest, but don't tell me I didn't warn you.[/quote]<br>

This person didn't care. I point you to the 3rd paragraph this exactly points out what we are talking about.<br>

<br>
Then, here he says that he lost everything because it fell to the ground during a transfer (as an aside, he could not have lost everything as his inventory must have been full if it fell to the ground).<br>

When I talked to Veeta, he was wearing full FP and crafted armor, wielding a wurmy and centi LS (said the weapons were given to him), nice equipment for a level 30, and was trying to sell the wurmy in EC<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Yes it can, it can also encourage the person to scam since it is successful. Hard to know which way the person would go with this. But you said you would not regret helping even if it turned out veeta was just a scammer. So that is a chance you are willing to take and that means you wont end up with regrets. Thats good and it is your choice and no way am I gonna argue you about your choice. Your heart is in the right place and in the end I can at least support that. It is your stuff afterall and you get to decide on what you do with it. I do hope you have a positive effect on veeta, I think veeta needs it.<br>
<br>
Personally, I am in danger of losing my &quot;liberal bleeding-heart&quot; membership card, cause I can be cold when I think the person is of bad character. Not proud of it, just honest about it. I would love to be able to keep my heart and mind open more. As you said Venen, sometimes it works to be kind, I truly hope veeta sees the spirit in which you help and learns somthing from it.

I was somewhat not convinced until I read the thread where Veeta accedently posted as a different account. Look how well he spoke, and with punctuation. Defending this con artist is only ruining your own reputation.<br>

The Officer happened to be in OT by the time Veeta said he had a corpse there, and the Officer promptly offered to help him, find the corpse.<br>
<br>
Veeta could not tell him where he had died, however, and after five minutes told the Officer to drop it, since he would let it rot and re-equip it later (with what?).<br>
<br>
Not only that, but in direct tells to the guildleader, he said he had died in FM the day before, and had to get a corpse-summon to get the corpse back. Well, I know FM quite a bit, and can't think of many places at all that would require a corpse summon. Besides, how was the coffin paid for?<br>
<br>
More important, I have seen the tells in log files, posted on out forum. When he did reply (sometimes he appeared to obviously ignore tells - he made /guildsays in between, but skipped the tells), he replied relatively fast, and without many spelling errors.<br>
<br>
A curious observation is that when Veeta is pointed to his spelling errors, he suddenly goes into a schism of sorts and screws up the language pretty bad - but when you get him off-guard (focussing on other issues) the problems are far less. There is no consistency in his spelling errors.<br>
<br>
From my personal experience, I would call this person a &quot;leech&quot;. Someone who draws all he wants to have from others, without respecting the efforts those others put into getting him those items. He just latches onto something and keeps stuck as long as he can drain. When the source dries up, he lets go and looks elsewhere. He appears to have little respect for other people, and the items they hand him (reminds me of a saying: &quot;easy gain is easy loss&quot;). When people turn on that, he suddenly starts acting the victim (again, his language issue is only one aspect in which this expresses itself).<br>
<br>
Besides, how much value do you attach to an apology that is only 3 or 4 lines, and that only came after half a dozen people told him to post one? After Tarot even gave him one hell of an example for one? Sorry, but to me the apology he made is only a quick and easy attempt of Veeta to try and get rid of the mess he got himself in. Considering what he has done, I would expect something more elaborate. Also, Veeta never bothered to post even a half decent apology on our Guild website (after all, not all our guildmembers read the Lanys forums).<br>
<br>
Do what you want, Venen, but don't be surprised when people frown upon your actions in this matter. <p><br><A Href="http://www.guildmagic.com/character.cfm?ID=30878"><IMG

People have tried to warn him, but it is up to him in the end. I dont see how is he ruining his rep by helping someone many feel is a scammer. Venen hasnt shown himself to be a scammer so why should we frown upon his actions. Ever have a friend that wont take your good advice? Can be frustrating but in the end we all make our own decisions and shouldnt be FORCED to do what others think we should. Everyone gave their advice, he read it, he decided on what he is gonna do. End of story.<br>
<br>
BTW Venen too bad you missed the gem of a shitlist thread started by Veeta, a real attention grabber, seems it has been deleted now, not locked, DELETED, not moved, DELETED. I do wish you the best Venen, I understand if you lose a few pixels, afterall it isnt much to lose in the grand scheme of things.<br>
<br>
Lets leave Venen to clear out his bank in peace. <p><center><img src="http://www.danos.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/jellah.gif" width="577" height="162"></center></p><i></i></td></tr></table>
