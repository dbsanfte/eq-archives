<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>
I've been hearing a lot of talk about &quot;bombing Afghanistan back to the Stone Age.&quot; Ronn Owens, on KGO Talk Radio today, allowed that this would mean killing innocent people, people who had nothing to do with this atrocity, but &quot;we're at war, we have to accept collateral damage. What else can we do?&quot;  Minutes later I heard some TV pundit discussing whether we &quot;have the belly to do what must be done.&quot;<br>
<br>
And I thought about the issues being raised especially hard because I am from Afghanistan, and even though I've lived here for 35 years I've never lost track of what's going on there. So I want to tell anyone who will listen how it all looks from where I'm standing.<br>
<br>
I speak as one who hates the Taliban and Osama Bin Laden. There is no doubt in my mind that these people were responsible for the atrocity in New York. I agree that something must be done about those monsters.<br>
<br>
But the Taliban and Ben Laden are not Afghanistan.  They're not even the government of Afghanistan.  The Taliban are a cult of ignorant psychotics who took over Afghanistan in 1997. Bin Laden is a political criminal with a plan. When you think Taliban, think Nazis. When you think Bin Laden, think Hitler. And when you think &quot;the people of Afghanistan&quot; think &quot;the Jews in the concentration camps.&quot;   It's not only that the Afghan people had nothing to do with this atrocity. They were the first victims of the perpetrators. They would exult if someone would come in there, take out the Taliban and clear out the rats nest of international thugs holed up in their country.<br>
<br>
Some say, why don't the Afghans rise up and overthrow the Taliban? The answer is, they're starved, exhausted, hurt, incapacitated, suffering. A few years ago, the United Nations estimated that there are 500,000 disabled orphans in Afghanistan--a country with no economy, no food. There are millions of widows.  And the Taliban has been burying these widows alive in mass graves.  The soil is littered with land mines, the farms were all destroyed by the Soviets.  These are a few of the reasons why the Afghan people have not overthrown the Taliban.<br>
<br>
We come now to the question of bombing Afghanistan back to the Stone Age. Trouble is, that's been done. The Soviets took care of it already. Make the Afghans suffer? They're already suffering. Level their houses? Done. Turn their schools into piles of rubble? Done.  Eradicate their hospitals? Done.  Destroy their infrastructure? Cut them off from medicine and health care?  Too late. Someone already did all that.<br>
<br>
New bombs would only stir the rubble of earlier bombs.  Would they at least get the Taliban? Not likely. In today's Afghanistan, only the Taliban eat, only they have the means to move around.  They'd slip away and hide. Maybe the bombs would get some of those disabled orphans, they don't move too fast, they don't even have wheelchairs. But flying  over Kabul and dropping bombs wouldn't really be a strike against the criminals who did this horrific thing. Actually it would only be making common cause with the Taliban--by raping once again the people they've been raping all this time<br>
<br>
So what else is there? What can be done, then? Let me now speak with true fear and trembling. The only way to get Bin Laden is to go in there with ground troops. When people speak of &quot;having the belly to do what needs to be done&quot; they're thinking in terms of having the belly to kill as many as needed.  Having the belly to overcome any moral qualms about killing innocent people. Let's pull our heads out of the sand. What's actually on the table is Americans dying. And not just because some Americans would die fighting their way through Afghanistan to Bin Laden's hideout.  It's much bigger than that folks. Because to get any troops to Afghanistan, we'd have to go through Pakistan. Would they let us? Not likely. The conquest of Pakistan would have to be first. Will other Muslim nations just stand by? You see where I'm going. We're flirting with a world war between Islam and the West.<br>
<br>
And guess what: that's Bin Laden's program. That's exactly what he wants. That's why he did this.  Read his speeches and statements. It's all right there.  He really believes Islam would beat the west. It might seem ridiculous, but he figures if he can polarize the world into Islam and the West, he's got a billion soldiers.  If the west wreaks a holocaust in those lands, that's a billion people with nothing left to lose, that's even better from Bin Laden's point of view.  He's probably wrong, in the end the west would win, whatever that would mean, but the war would last for years and millions would die, not just theirs but ours. Who has the belly for that? Bin Laden does. Anyone else?<br>

<br>
Maybe Pakistan would allow a ground assault on Afghanistan from it's soil. But I don't think they've explicitly said so. Iran supports the &quot;war on terrorism&quot;, but <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2001/WORLD/meast/09/17/ret.iran.us/">won't support an invasion of Afghanistan</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->. India has said they'll allow planes to fly from India for air assault, but it does not border Afghanistan. (Afghanistan borders Pakistan, Iran, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, and a very small land border with China).<br>
<br>
Note that going after the Taliban isn't going after the last recognised government of Afghanistan. From the <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/af.html">CIA Factbook</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->:<br>

Made a tear run down my face, but to tell you the truth I am still in very strong support of an invasion of Afganistan. How? Full air stike lasting 5months+ and then we send in atleast 1 million ground troops (and every tank and artillery piece that we have) from NATO.<br>
<br>
 People in the USA have been going to church alot this week, and thats not only for the 6k+ people that died last tuesday, but because we know ALOT of innocent people will die when we bomb. Lets face it there is no such thing as a &quot;surgical strike&quot;. For those innocent souls who are about to die in the US's bombings of Afganistan my deepest condolences and I salute you! <br>

The President has spoken much recently of long and involved conflict, which will indeed involve the use of ground forces.  If the idea was to bomb the entire country of Afghanistan into oblivion, then believe me, that would have passed already.<br>
<br>
The statements we hear today &quot;bombing into the stone age, nuke em all, etc.&quot; are simply made by a people who are hurting terribly, grieving at the horrendous loss we have faced.  Right now emotions run high, and the injured lash out like wounded animals, and although it is irrational, it is understandable.  However, I have confidence that the leaders of the United States will indeed act rationally, and it is imperative that we support them.<br>

The Northern Alliance is the legit govt. of Afghanistan.  They control about 5% of the land of Afghanistan and have pledge 15000 troops to the cause.  If we can't bomb the Taliban, and we must send in ground troops, why not pull off a massive air-drop in this region?  We did it in Berlin during the cold war, we did it in France during the invasion or Normandy, and we can do it here. <p>Ecofreak Risingwood<BR>

It is a hard blow to the resistance. Massoud was one of those people who believe in peace and in freedom in his country. Having read some of his interviews, I can say that thios man didnt deserved to die like this.<br>
<br>
As for landing people in this 10% of ground on the hand of the resistance, it isnt feasible. This part of Afghanistan is under massive attack since this morning and the resistance will be eradicate by the Talibans.<br>
<br>
I am not a supporter of war. But if bin Laden is found guilty and if Talibans still protect him, i will support the Nato and the USA in their plan to free the Afghanistan from this plague.<br>
<br>
Being an Afghan today is something I didnt want to wish to my worst ennemy. Those people there (the non-taliban) are dying, starvering and have no hope for tommorow.<br>
<br>
If you go there as a military, keep in mind that those people are not responsible. They will maybe not like you (who can like a military invading his country anyway) but once they will be free from Bin Laden and the Talibans, they will say thanks to the USA. <br>

<br>
Unfortunately, the Taliban is in the comfortable position that extremist regimes always wind up in.  They literally have a human shield of innocents that they can utilize to protect them while they consume 100% of the nations resources.<br>
<br>
It was truly sad to see the legions of Afghanis trying to leave the country; a battered people who have suffered far more than any people ever should.<br>
<br>
I don't really know what an acceptable course of action is in a case like this.  Afghanistan is unique in that it is very nearly unasailable.  It is controlled by a radical government that will not negotiate and has been incorrectly empowered by a major nation (I think Pakistan never realized how bad the Taliban would become).<br>
<br>
I do not think, however, that we will see an enormous land blitzkrieg or a continuous program of bombing.  Those actions would simply accomplish nothing other than killing innocents and, despite the rhetoric of our enemies, modern America does not revel in the loss of innocent lives.<br>
<br>
As for all of these so called &quot;Americans&quot; spreading their poison through bigotry and hate crimes, no words can properly express the disgust I feel.  These racist bastards are, in many ways, *worse* than the terrorists IMO because they call themselves American while they try to destroy our great land. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ulargar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Largar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 38<br> <font color=#E9D756>(9/18/01 10:24:46 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=177.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Words of an Afghani living in the US</span><hr size=1> Look here, Im real sorry and bothered by the fact innocent people may die in Afghanistan. <br>

Ok, maybe you only let this guy live in your country, and your not behind what he did, or help do. This may sound cruel, but Im sorry, we must inflict a large enough wound, so that no country will harbour such an ass bite anymore.<br>

We've been put in a corner, please dont be offended if we come out swinging. <br>

And NO way would it take us YEARS to wipe out any oppositioon in the middle east. Please dont prey on our our cowards with such propiganda.<br>

My best advice to the author: become an American. after all, all of us came here from another country, because we wanted to.

What we *can* do is swing public opinion of the islamic nations over to our side so *they* take an active role in removing terrorist elements internally.<br>
<br>
You've got to understand that these elements represent a very dangerous minority in most of these countries and that taking them on could result in the country falling apart.  It must be approached with caution and intelligence.<br>
<br>
Bombing a nation with tens of millions of people in order to cripple a military regime of less than 100,000 isn't going to accomplish that...<br>

To be honest, that's what I think these nations are looking for and that is what I assume we are providing.

After all of the academic bullshit settles, that's what it comes down to (although it wasn't only the US that sponsored that action, we seem to take the blame for it because of our very obvious support of modern Israel).<br>
<br>
I think it is important that we not abandon Israel (our ally), but I also think that it may be time for us to take a hard look at both sides of the issue and try to find some mutually acceptable solution.  Palestinians have been suicide bombing Israel for years and Israel has returned the favor with military action.<br>
<br>
The cycle of death there fuels the other islamic nations (who don't need a lot of convincing to hate Israel) and makes the terrorists look like heroes (to the impressionable).<br>
<br>
The whole world has sort of ignored the issue (for the most part) while it has gotten worse.  It's the old &quot;ah, those people have been killing each other forever&quot; argument.  I don't for a minute think that the Palestinian situation is the sole cause of what happened Tuesday (Bin Laden has his own lunatic agenda), but rather I think that helping to resolve it would win a lot of favor among normal muslims. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <br><font color=#E9D756>- </font><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/bemarr>Erollisi Marr, The Queen of Love</a><font color=#E9D756> - </font><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18>America Under Attack</a> <font color=#E9D756> - </font> <br>
