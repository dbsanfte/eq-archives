<br>
Voices From the Fringe <br>
Embattled stars, Hollywood's and the NRA's. <br>
<br>
Wednesday, February 13, 2002 12:01 a.m. EST <br>
<br>
It isn't easy to follow the stories, not to mention the travel plans, of all the Hollywood luminaries who announced plans to leave the country in the event their candidate lost the presidency. As he did in 2000, despite countless warnings by Barbra Streisand, Cher, Julia Roberts and similar analysts that a George W. Bush presidency would bring a wave of repression as yet unmatched in our history. As Ms. Streisand explained it, &quot;Our whole way of life is at stake.&quot;<br>
<br>
Notwithstanding the new dark age to fall on us if Al Gore went down to defeat, Ms. Streisand and company issued no declarations about leaving the country--a wise move. At least one member of the House of Baldwin may have wished he'd done the same by the time he'd finished efforts to undo the messes issuing from just such a bulletin about his own plans in the event Mr. Bush became president. <br>
<br>
That would be Alec Baldwin, actor and political activist, and husband (at the time) of Kim Basinger, who delivered the news in an interview with the German magazine Focus. On this occasion, shortly before the election, Ms. Basinger held forth on her husband's character and principles. &quot;Alec is the biggest moralist that I know. He stands completely behind what he says.&quot; She could, further, well imagine Alec making good on his threat. &quot;And then I'd probably have to go too.&quot; <br>
<br>
Deluged by adverse publicity once the story reached the U.S., Mr. Baldwin explained that his wife had never talked to that magazine, that she had never heard of it, and that he had never made any such comments about leaving America. Focus magazine then produced a transcript, which forced Mr. Baldwin to provide a variety of other explanations. &quot;The studio forces you to do dozens of interviews with people you never heard of,&quot; he told the New York Daily News, and, moreover, he and his wife had certainly &quot;never said unequivocally&quot; that they would leave the country if Mr. Bush won.<br>
<br>
<br>
Also among the celebrities announcing plans to emigrate if George Bush won was director Robert Altman--today enjoying a resurgent career thanks to the praise (and multiple Oscar nominations) heaped on his new film, &quot;Gosford Park.&quot; In 2000 he talked to reporters at a French film festival (for reasons too obvious to explicate, meditations about the need to leave America tend to be delivered only on foreign shores, or reserved for the ears of the foreign press). There, at Deauville, Mr. Altman announced that he would move to France if George Bush won.<br>
Mr. Bush did win, of course, and Mr. Altman didn't move, which doesn't mean the director has given up public brooding on the subject. Indeed, we learn from a Times of London interview, conducted only last month, that Mr. Altman wanted to stay in England, for reasons he outlined in clear, if familiar, detail.<br>
<br>
&quot;This present government in America I just find disgusting,&quot; he informed the reporter. Further, its president was a man who couldn't run a baseball team successfully. He would be happy to stay in England because there is nothing in America he would miss at all. &quot;When I see an American flag flying, it's a joke.&quot;<br>
<br>
There is, of course, a limit to the number of times one can take to the public stage to renounce one's country and heap scorn on its leaders--after which audiences are bound to begin heading for the exits. Indeed, Mr. Altman might do well to ration further public pronouncements on his wish to abandon the U.S. for France, Britain, and similar political Edens. Otherwise--fearful vision--we may find him wandering the shores of Europe in perpetuity, catching at the sleeves of travelers to announce that he has decided to leave America.<br>
<br>
<br>
The five months that have passed since Sept. 11 have thrown a spotlight on every aspect of life, every quarter of opinion. One way or another, all are involved. Wartime has a way of doing that. But for the assault of Sept. 11, we would not now be staring, in equal parts revulsion and fascination, at John Walker Lindh, Taliban fighter from California, and thinking about the parents who had happily signed the checks for their special boy, reveling in what they saw as his openness, and sent him merrily off to Yemen or anywhere else he wished.<br>
For which they received, in return, envenomed letters and e-mails, like the one to his mother that read, &quot;I really don't know what your big attachement \[sic\] to America is all about. What has America ever done for anybody?&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
In that spotlight we have seen and heard from the entire spectrum of our political activists--establishment types, along with any number of homegrown fringe groups--and it is some show. Frothing-at-the-mouth zealots of the right are as one with those of the left in their concern that security measures could erode civil liberties.<br>
The latest to raise the alarm was Wayne LaPierre, executive vice president of the National Rifle Association, and a man normally preoccupied with the endless travails of gun owners. Two weeks ago, Mr. LaPierre took to the microphones to declare that the nation had &quot;witnessed a fire sale of American liberties at bargain-basement prices&quot; and that Americans must not allow themselves to be swayed into endorsing this fire sale by &quot;a popular conservative president.&quot; <br>
<br>
The executive vice president of the NRA was, it seems, particularly exercised by airport security measures like body searches, and similar high crimes against freedom. In Mr. LaPierre's world, now as ever, no menace is secondary to that of government controls, or more incendiary than infringements on individual rights. There is a movie in here somewhere, for an ambitious director. <br>
<br>
<br>
As for Mr. Altman, he may, someday in some brighter future, shed the miseries of life in America and move to England. There, over long meals at the Reform Club, he could sit with London's best and brightest and share horror stories about the States--a refugee happily ashore at last. <br>

But in all honesty Gore being a &quot;big phony bs'er&quot; is far less destrubing to me considering Bush is a &quot;big phony bs'er&quot; plus less intelligent.  <br>
Military record, drinking record, alleged drug record, baseball record, oil record, speach record, bushism record.<br>
You can not look at me with a strait face (because we live in different states <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ) and tell me that you don't think Bush is a &quot;big phoney bs'er.&quot;  <br>
And if you dare say anything about the whole &quot;I created the internet thing&quot; I will scream.  That was taken way out of context.  Gore helped get the internet into the public's hands while in political offices prier to being vice-president.  Gore played a huge part in getting the interent pushed through the House and Senate as being allowed for private use.  Look it up if you don't believe me.

Bush Over Election Reform<br>
By Brendan Farrington Associated Press Writer <br>
Published: Mar 6, 2002<br>
<br>
<br>
 <br>
  <br>
TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) - Actor Alec Baldwin was at the Capitol on Wednesday, much to the surprise of Gov. Jeb Bush. <br>
&quot;He had promised he would leave the country if my brother got elected,&quot; Bush said during a stop in Orlando. &quot;Well he's back, I guess. We'll welcome him to Tallahassee.&quot; <br>
<br>
But Baldwin disputed that he said he'd leave the country if George W. Bush were elected. <br>
<br>
&quot;I never made that statement, but you can tell Gov. Bush to rest assured that I'm not going to leave the country because we have to get him out of office and we have to get his brother out of office in 2004. We're not resting until we get that done.&quot; <br>
<br>
Even if he had made the statement, Baldwin said there was still no reason to leave. <br>
<br>
&quot;Bush wasn't elected, he was selected - selected by five judges up in Washington who voted along party lines,&quot; Baldwin said. <br>
<br>
Baldwin was in Tallahassee with People for the American Way to criticize Gov. Bush and Florida officials for not doing more to reform Florida's election system. <br>
<br>
The state was the focus of the world during the 2000 presidential election when it took five weeks to declare George W. Bush the winner. <br>
<br>
The election dispute ended when the U.S. Supreme Court stopped a recount. Many Democrats believe Al Gore would have won the election if the recount had not been stopped. <br>
<br>
Lt. Gov. Frank Brogan got in on the discussion, saying outside the Capitol, &quot;I haven't seen any of Alec Baldwin's work myself; I understand he's mildly talented.&quot; <br>
