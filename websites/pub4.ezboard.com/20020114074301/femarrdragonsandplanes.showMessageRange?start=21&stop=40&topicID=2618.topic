  You keep thinking that Giro, if it makes you sleep better at night then more power to you.  However:<br>
<br>
  (1)  No pickup raid has, to my knowledge, taken down a SINGLE Kunark dragon, including Trakanon.  Feel free to correct me on this.<br>
<br>
  (2)  Only ONE pick-up raid leader has been able to take down a Velious 'Uber' mob.  That person is Enki, who I have a LOT of respect for.  Hell... I was on a couple of the raids myself.  However, Enki was friends with an extremely high proportion of the older, higher level players of E-Marr and had a high percentage of them along for the ride.  This is NOT to put Enki down, I personally think he could have done it solo with his mad Enki Pet™ skills, but that's just me.<br>
<br>
  This would tend to suggest to me that there's more to it than knowing the resists or a_sekrit_strategy_xploit01.  Surely, if you're right, then a pickup raid would now be knocking on Vulak's door?  .<br>

Your healers have to know their stuff, but other than that there's not a lot of complicated tactical stuff going on.  When you start working with mobs that cast, gate, or heal, tactics start to get more demanding.  When you deal with mobs that have AE breath weapons or other attacks, you run into the same old snag that used to plague old world dragon runs: most pickup raiders just don't have the drive and motivation to get top notch resist gear.  This is what's going to make pickup runs on the Kunark dragons tough.  If people can barely handle gearing up for Naggy and Vox, how are they going to deal with Gore?  Like Tuan, I'm not saying it'll never happen.  It's not going to be as easy as Naggy and Vox were, though. <p>Ahry - hero of Gaoth an Iar, Percival server <BR>

There is no doubt in my mind that given the right mindset a determined group will destroy anything you throw in front of them given time.<br>
<br>
And the other thing to remember is that most pick-up raids these days are formed by people who regularly raid together. The only thing missing is the guild tag. <p><HTML><CENTER>

If you sum it all up all I am saying is:<br>
<br>
** Have the nerve to try and die until you find the best tactic **<br>
<br>
This is what it originally took to figure out how to do it. . .The main reason that pick-up raids arent doing it is because they dont know how to and dont have the people willing to try n die till they figure it out. . .<br>
<br>
Oh and just because you haven't seen me on your raid doesn't mean I haven't been to plenty *grin*<br>

Tactic:<br>
40 of your closest level 57+ friends<br>
Bank everything you have except your armor weaps and resist gear. . .Meet near a_mob_spawn_01. . .buff up - go. . .Fail. . .<br>

I read that same comment that Patric just quoted and I'm not sure how to interpret it. Has a true pick-up raid actually killed the Chardok Queen already? I know some have tried but have failed. She's no velious 1st brood dragon, but she's no pushover to be taken too lightly either. But if all he's trying to say is that she's on par with Nag/Vox then his assumption is correct: he is wrong. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Queen's spawn time is &lt;2 hours (so virtually always up) and has been around for well over a year and a pick-up group hasn't killed her yet but they have been ganking Nag/Vox regularly for a while now - yes, there is a reason for that.<br>
<br>
Comment:<br>
Pick-up raids are getting better. PoG and Kael are common, and I'm sure HoT, Chardok Queen, and Kunark Dragons (well, if/when they can find them up) are coming soon.<br>
<br>
But don't hold your breath on Velious dragons. I would be willing to bet good money that there won't be a successful pick-up raid against a top WW dragon (Kland or Sontalak) while most people that read this board now are still in EQ at all (say 3 years) unless VI nerfs them or seriously upgrades all players (level cap up to 65 or 70 would do it).<br>
<br>
If you think otherwise, I'd bet you never fought one. I know that after reading how Mag, SF, LoS, FoH, etc. post on their news section about how they ripped through one as an afterthought to get another ST key for a new guildie, it may sound pretty easy to you, but it ain't.<br>
<br>
Oh, and no, I don't mean a pick-up raid like one of those Enki Vindi raids. I made it to one of those and it looked like a who's who of Emarr - mostly &quot;uber&quot; guild people goofing off doesn't count. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uryinstormcaller.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ryin Stormcaller</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 10<br> <font color=#E9D756>(11/5/01 9:34:31 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: End Game, the Naggy and Vox of tomorrow!</span><hr size=1> I think you people are also missing another element to this, and thats gear<br>
<br>
back when naggy and vox were being done gear really didn't matter that much, I mean shoot for 100FC/MR, or 100CR/MR and you were set. Nowdays even in Kunark dragons require 200+ of all the resists you need, and its far worse in Velious...and I'm not just talking resist gear. I'm talking +mana gear for the clerics and wizards, I'm talking AC gear for the main tanks, I'm talking the best pierces for the rogues, and the best swords for the warriors.<br>
<br>
Quite honestly I don't think there is anyway in hell there will be pickup raids to any first class Velious dragons for at least 2 years (I'm not talking woushi here), much less NToV dragons, unless most of the raiders are from the top 4 or 5 guilds on the server and have the equipment thats up to par with velious mobs.<br>

Ive seen unguilded in trak bps. its very possible for 40 unguilded lv 60s to do velious dragons especially easy ubers like Lendinaria and Zland.<br>
<br>
Pickup dragon raids will be happening regularly in velious within a few months. I think Wuoshi was already killed by a pickup raid.  <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=6742"target="_blank">

Then the part of me that knows I like to run my mouth when so motivated gets over it.<br>
<br>
Without naming names, I know of two types of &quot;high-end players&quot;.  The wise and the arrogant.  I'm sure you know what I'm talking about.  The ones who seem elitist, but really aren't.  You can tell because they treat others with respect, they just happen to know more than you.  And then the ones who like to talk down at everyone else, and feel no need to explain that their post had some point other than to make themselves feel superior.<br>
<br>
My post is for the Wise.  Again, without naming names, I was happy to see a lot of the Wise post on this thread instead of the Arrogant, so I thank you.<br>
<br>
I think that pick-up raids are a viable method of accomplishing many things in Norrath.  In a lot of ways it's a matter of time.<br>
<br>
In the same vein as I believe in the difference between different kinds of players at the high-end game, there are those same differences among the pick-up crew.<br>
<br>
In my opinion, there are those among guilds such as Magister, Midnight Fury, and others who were core crucial to learning tactics, strategizing battles, understanding the strengths and weaknesses of the team, and working toward success.  And I know there are some who wear uberguildtags who are hangers-on and tactical necessities.  Not every Magister person is a strategist, tactician, or leader.  Nor Midnight Fury, or any other guild.  That is simply my opinion.<br>
<br>
That said, one of the basic challenges of pick-up crews is that you don't necessarily have that intimate knowledge of who is a thinker, a leader, a strategist, or a person who pushes the envelope of their class.  And this is the difficulty of pick-up raids.<br>
<br>
If indeed wisdom comes from experience, this is where the uberguilds show their mettle.  One of the biggest factors I know of in the recruiting policy of our uberguilds is high playtime during the same hours as the rest of the guild.  That if you invest that commitment, you can attain that experience, therefore developping that wisdom.  Again, in my opinion this is subject to the kind of player/person you are.  Being there doesn't mean you experienced the encounter.  Being truly invested of yourself in the encounter will yield the highest potential wisdom from it, succeed or fail.<br>
<br>
Smaller guilds exist and endure through the level 50+ game because, in my observation, the goals of the guild do not revolve around tactical/logistical strength.  I mean to say that there are smaller guilds who choose not to compromise their founding charters in order to muster the strength and firepower to conduct guild-only raids.  And it's their prerogative.<br>
<br>
Da`kor was meant to kick ass.  That's what they did.  That was their bottom line.  It was their reason for being.  Remember the webpage?  &quot;We do not sit around and talk to our friends.  This isn't meant to sound elitist.  There are plenty of other good guilds out there in Norrath.  Da`kor is not for everyone.&quot;  No matter how you think that sounds, they were being honest.<br>
<br>
Smaller guilds may want to kick ass, but it isn't the Alpha and Omega of their existence.  That doesn't mean they are incompetent, or have no balls.  Maybe they love to roleplay.  Maybe they have real life priorities which prevent them from making the high playtime commitment when trying to balance their life, and don't like to make commitments they can't keep.  Whatever the reason, they have them.  Their charters say &quot;We are a roleplay guild&quot; or &quot;We seek to form and maintain a guild of friends&quot; and other such goals.<br>
<br>
But the uberguilds have shown the way to the high-end game.  Cohesive teamwork.  Knowing your strengths and weaknesses.  Knowing what you can and cannot achieve with a particular strategy with the particular group you have, and how to do it.  They were first because they worked fastest and hardest to make it happen.<br>
<br>
Pick-up raids may work as hard, but can't work as fast.  I think that is an accepted fact.  It takes time to learn tactics and get to know each other.  Along the same line as my espoused dichotomy of &quot;The Wise versus The Arrogant&quot; is my belief in &quot;The Hardworking Conscientious Pick-Up Raider versus the Uberl33t Wannabe Pick-Up Raid Whiner&quot;.  The impact here is that in a pick-up raid, if you don't know the person, they can potentially ruin the raid for everyone, and it takes time to get to know who those folks are.<br>
<br>
All that preamble is my lead-in to the point I'm trying to make here.  The pick-up folks on EMarr have begun to get to know each other and make some good strides in poise and teamwork.  At a snail's pace compared to what the uberguilds can/would do, I admit.  But it's there.  And with that spark, with that teamwork, with the will, and some lucky breaks (VS pick-up rotation, etc), I believe they can and probably will taste greatness in Norrath.  The Wise and the Arrogant alike may find the achievment boring and old, but the folks who participate won't.<br>
<br>
On our own server we have the JP alliance, which was formed through common bond and has spots on the rotations.  On Morell-Thule is the Gathering of Banners, a conglomerate of smaller roleplay guilds who likewise achieve higher-end encounters.  Smaller guilds and guildless, who wish to advance in the game, but don't have the same kind of focus and discipline as core-raid uberguilds.  We have the makings of forming pick-up raids of such folks, however informally, and accomplishing some tough encounters on EMarr.<br>
<br>
I don't think anyone needs to be offended by that possibility.  It's no skin off of anyone's nose, in my opinion.  The uberguilds and server-first guilds busted their butts to get there first and fastest.  The pick-up folks can get there too with that same hard work.  They just won't be the first.  But I don't think that makes them any less worthy of honour.  Sense of accomplishment and glory are not the same thing.<br>
<br>
If you read this far, I'm both thankful and surprised.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

The only way pick-up raids are going to do the uber mobs is when they form thier own guilds, ally with other small guilds and learn to work together better.  This may make my argument null because they are more guild than pick-up. . .But it is truely what it comes down to IMHO. . . <p><div align=right><a href=http://www.eqeclipse.com border=0><img src=http://216.188.92.243/~eqeclipse.com/girosig.jpg></img></a><BR><b><font face="Arial" size="3">Officer of Radiant Eclipse</font></b><br></div></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ugirolamosavonarola.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Girolamo Savonarola</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 26<br> <font color=#E9D756>(11/5/01 1:24:41 pm)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: End Game, the Naggy and Vox of tomorrow!</span><hr size=1> Sorry I forgot one thing. . .<br>
