Solathan,<br>
<br>
  I don't think I have time to respond to every bit of your post, but I'll take a crack at a few pieces of it.<br>
<br>
&quot;- As time passes, Ottoman empire falls into the deepest pits of corruption, and loses all its ethics and morality, turning them into tyranny and such ( don't most of them go that way?)&quot;<br>
<br>
Hm, this sounds like you're coloring the actions of the Ottoman Empire to set the stage for your representation of the facts.  This isn't a fact, it's you're opinion =)<br>
<br>
&quot;More time passes, World War I erupts, millions and millions die, and the Ottoman Empire falls down, the 'sick man' dies.&quot;<br>
<br>
At this point you neglect to mention that it was in 1922 that it was agreed that Israel and Palestine would become independant seperate countries in this region.  This is a very important fact without which, some of the things you point to later don't give a full picture.<br>
<br>
&quot;-World War II starts, the inhumane, evil and vile 'Holocaust' ( look at other threads to see what i think about killing innocents  ) happens. Lots of innocent jews die. Britain is fed up with the trouble it has to deal with in Palastine. The 'Promise of Belfor ( sp? ) ' is promised, and the start of the Israeli country solidifies.&quot;<br>
<br>
Somewhat inaccurate, see my comment about 1922.  Israel was destined to become a state long before WW II was even a nightmare in Hitler's eye.   So was Palestine.  The Holocaust did 2 things for Israeli statehood :<br>
1 - Showed that the Jews needed a place of their own, or they would continue to be persecuted.<br>
2 - Debilitated the British Empire such that it could no longer keep what colonies it still had.<br>
<br>
&quot; The land 'deeds' of Palastinee people are considered 'invalid' according to the Israeili goverment, and are valueless. Folks are Evicted.&quot;<br>
<br>
Only partially accurate.  First, Israel 'evicted' Palestinians from territory destined to become 'Israel'.  This is as opposed to the land that was to become 'Palestine'.  One must wonder why the Palestinians did not migrate to Palestine over the years.<br>
Another major fact :<br>
1 - They were attacked by the Palestinians and other Arab states the day after being recognized.<br>
Im sure this fact plays no small role in the eviction of the Palestinians.  Keep in mind this was not a war fought with armies for the most part, it was largely fought by settlers in their houses and neighborhoods with their wives and children standing behind them.<br>
<br>
The above answers this question you place :<br>
&quot;Why did the Israeli goverment accept those sales ( from absentees no less) and consider their deeds valid and then chose  to discard the deeds of the local palastinees?&quot;<br>
<br>
The Palestinians waged war on Israel.  They lost.  Case closed.<br>
<br>
&quot;Let's assume i bought 95% of the landscape in hte state of florida (Just an example, insert any name of any state/province, place in any place in the world ). Does that give me the right to bring my own goverment and do what i want in that area?&quot;<br>
<br>
First, It does if the UN says you're an independant country.  Second, this analogy is false because the USA and Florida have functioning govornments.  The areas Israel occupies did not have functioning govornments, except the British one which was about to leave.  The analogy to provinces / states of functioning govornments is patently false.<br>
<br>
&quot;Without Britain's promise and its denied 'support' ( them UN and the sort ) , how could the purchase of that land (which is still sort-of  disputed, look above) legalize the eviction, massacres, and the institution of a goverment on that land?&quot;<br>
<br>
Two govorments were supposed to take control of seperate areas, one Palestinian the other Israeli.  Despite your emotionalistic words, the reality is one of three choices 1 - All Israeli state, 2 - All Palestinian state, or 3 - Seperate states.   The choice was made for #3, 2 states.  I suppose you would want an all Palestinian run state?  <br>
<br>
&quot;Really, how could that rationally and logically happen? How could the Israeli army ( which, as you say is inferiorly equipped and with less warriors) win against them all, without support?&quot;<br>
<br>
Do you believe in God?  <br>
<br>
In this specific case though, the Arabs started fighting each other.  However, the 'luck' of the Israeli military is probably the best case for the existance of God that I know of in recent times.  Or maybe its just proof that modern Arab culture is inherently corrupt, that they would bungle so many conflicts when the odds were so much in their favor.  Americans tend to think it was because of american tech, but the simple fact is they didn't use much american stuff until after 1973, the last big Arab-Israeli war.  They won 3 other wars without our tech, and the 1973 war was about half / half US and French weapons.  The same kind of weapons the Arab states have available to them. <br>
<br>
And no, i don't buy off on your conspiracy theory about support for Israel.  Europe was still selling equipment to the Middle East, but both Europe and USA had embargos on Israel.<br>
<br>
Here is a dirty little secret though.  The US became more pro-israeli when it learned that Israel had almost gone nuclear in the first days of the 1973 Yom Kippur war.  Israel apparently obtained the ability to create nuclear weapons when the French sold them a reactor and heavy water in the mid to late 1960s.<br>

Ill tell you why you dont.  CAUSE YOU DON T KNOW JACK!! The only posts I see of yours are critiques of others.   You dont have the balls or the brains to make your own post.  YOu are just like most people.  You criticize others to make yourself look better.   You dumbasses really believe that palestinians only want to kill jews??  You dont think they have a right to be angry with the jews for settling on their land??  Go to your library and search Palestine and Israel and you will see that Israel is settling JEWS on palestinian land that was NOT bought by Jews.  yea, I dont know what happeneed 50 or so years ago but neither do all you fuks.  All you people coming on the board bitching at people for expressing their opinions.   You dont know shit obviously.  If your only reason for coming to this board is to criticize others and offer no good information on the topic then shut the fuk up.  I do know one thing about the Israel/Palestinian conflict.  And it TRUE that Jews are being settled on Palestinian Lands by the JEWISH government.   Warangel ,  GO blow yourself.  Oh, thats right, You don't have one, you fukin panzy coward. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showMessage?topicID=242.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showMessage?topicID=250.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=207.topic&index=56><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/gfx/addReply1.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.emailToFriend?topicID=207.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.threadControl?topicID=207.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/deleteThreadFire.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=207.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=207.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub4.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="emarrmessageboardrules">Message Board Rules<option value="emarrlinks">Links<option value="emarrupcomingmmorpgs">Upcoming MMOG's<option value="emarrfrm16">The Emarr Quadrant<option value="emarrfrm18">America Under Attack<option value="emarrfrm19">Dark Age of Camelot<option value="emarrgeneral">General<option value="emarrfrm17">Funny Stuff<option value="emarrbazaar">Item Bazaar<option value="emarrscrollsnspells">Spell Bazaar<option value="emarrfrm15">Shiny Things<option value="emarrfrm14">Bargain Basement<option value="emarrdragonsandplanes">Rants and Flames<option value="emarrfrm13">Dragons and Planes<option value="emarrroleplaying">Roleplaying<option value="emarrroleplayingoocforum">Roleplaying - OOC Forum<option value="emarrscammeralert">Scammer Alert<option value="emarrsignaturecorner">Test Forum<option value="emarrreallife">Real Life<option value="emarrothermmorpgs">Other MMOG's</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#E9D756>- </font><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/bemarr>Erollisi Marr, The Queen of Love</a><font color=#E9D756> - </font><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18>America Under Attack</a> <font color=#E9D756> - </font><br><br> <br>
