<br>
/petition Hello GM, so glad you are enjoying your Free EQ subscription, just wanted to drop you a line and say thanks for all the times I petitioned and you did absolutely nothing because the bug I was reporting was not yet documented.  <br>
<br>
Although NOT being able to /corpse my body because it was far beyone the zone line in KC, far off in limbo you still are not convinced that it is not some type of scheme for me to get a free res from you.  Infact, I often zone with full health to appear naked and at bind point, I'm sure this happens to everyone.<br>
<br>
I'm sure you remember the time that I was simply looting a tundra yeti and after clicking &quot;done&quot; I went LD to come back naked at bind point... this must also be a scheme for me to get free resses.<br>
<br>
Or how about that time that my whole group in DL and close to say 30 other people in the zone all went LD at the same, many coming back naked and at their bind point? That was a joy. and yet an undocumented bug like this prevented you from ressing anyone- you are always so helpful.<br>
<br>
Gee I'd go on and on about my wonderful experiences with GM's thus far, but I really just can't say enough.<br>
<br>
<br>
p.s. Fuck you GM's, you suck ass. Please stop blaming Verant for their Policies and do something about it you useless fuckwads. I'd enjoy this game more if you weren't here at all- it's much more frustrating to know that you are there and still refuse to assist.<br>
<br>
p.s. You always argue that if you res someone that went LD than you would have to res everyone that goes LD.... I say great. Do that. They pay for their gaming time, and you do not- so again fuck you, just res them... res them all and do it everytime somebody asks you too- fuck you and fuck verant for your lack of customer service.<br>
<br>

<br>
Wow what a pretty pink and green sky we have in this world.<br>
_________________<br>
<br>
I have been very kind and patient with GM's even through the afore mentioned issues and non help. (the above comment was not a real petition) only after the last petition I had to deal with- I lost all confidence in GM's.  The reason I was cordial during my petitions is because I myself am in and have been in a technical support for over 8 years. I do know customer service. Verant has no idea what customer service is and thus ties the hands of the GM's- this is frustrating- both for the GM's and for the players.<br>
<br>
If people want to pull the phone plug and go LD in a bad situation because that saves their asses then that is their choice.- my proposed solution to this is to simply clear agro upon a LD.- this would not be hard to do for the programmers.  If GM's can't res people due to LD then make it so that people don't die if they go LD.  Don't worry about this being a poss. exploit- so what if it is. This game could use a few ways to make it easier.<br>
<br>
IF THEY EXPLOIT IT - SOOOO FUCKING WHAT !  they pay for their game time- if they want to play in this manner what the fuck do you care?!? If you GM's don't want to have to res so many people, then make LD clear agro- for those of us that play honestly and are not trying to exploit anything the current policy fucks us all. <br>
<br>
Good GOD !!! There are actually legitimate technical issues that happen OFTEN, that cause deaths and LD - and just because they are not &quot;documented bugs&quot; GM's are not able to assist. Fuck you Verant! - what are your GM's even there for?<br>
<br>
- GM's are rendered virtually useless by the policies that verant lays down.<br>
<br>
This all spawns from me being as nice as anyone can possibly be and still being screwed by this fucking policy (this in responce to the comment about my attitude getting me nowhere with the GM's) and GM's are too scared of being banned for giving resses (what a crime to res someone, OMG people /shivver)<br>
<br>
Christ!!!,  how fucking hard is it to track or log the petitions that you handle? I have software that helps me to identify customers- it tells us about their previous calls, or in this case it would be petitions.  A tool like this would allow GM's to identify customers that were truly &quot;exploiting&quot; with /petition res requests and they could deal with those individuals as offenders- but for me... When I /petition it is because something that was not supposed to happen in the game happened, and I want a GM's to 1: Report the technical issue to their development teams and 2: not make me suffer a death due to a technical issue.<br>
<br>
GM's in their purest form are a grand thing- I usually love them because they appear to actually care about the people in the game. However it is outlandish when I have a legitimate technical issue and can not get help for fear of me being a scammer of some kind- it's offensive. I came across as being cheesed off at GM's- I'm really cheesed off at Verant , it's policies and lack of customer service- <br>
<br>
It's just that the GM's I have dealt with lately have been completely useless- and I have vowed to not petition anything anymore due to the complete waste of time it has become. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/udwarkarn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dwarkarn</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://members.home.net/freemana/Graphics/mcpi1.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 2194<br> <font color=#E9D756>(1/14/02 1:49:25 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2909.topic&index=44>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Kaikachi, Anyone got that pic?</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>   If people want to pull the phone plug and go LD in a bad situation because that saves their asses then that is their choice.- my proposed solution to this is to simply clear agro upon a LD.- this would not be hard to do for the programmers.

Maybe if you ask Verant very nicely they could have a difficulty slider for the game, it could be set at hard, medium or easy for retarded fuckwits who are having trouble coping with the tremendous complexities *cough cough* of Everquest.<br>

So let me get this right, they pay for the game so they have a right to exploit any given situation? Using your logic it would be ok for me to follow you around Norrath kill stealing and ninja looting every mob I see you trying to fight, because after all I pay my $10 a month to play too. See how when you open your mouth without thinking you end up looking foolish?<br>

GM's are there for lots of things, replacement of items that have disappeared due to bugs, resses due to death through legitimate bugs, investigating kill stealing allegations, making sure people who use profanity in public channells receive warnings or even bannings and much more. Everytime I have had to deal with a GM which mind you has been 3 times in 2 and a half years of playing I have received what I think was good customer service and my problem was solved.<br>
<br>
You sound like one of these annoying cum-guzzling fuckburgers that petitions 50 times a day for ridiculous bullshit and are part of the reason that GM's are forced to act the way they do.<br>
<br>
If you hate Verant as much as you claim to do, why not just boycot their product and not play the game? Or is it the fact that you don't have the balls to take that type of stand?<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>   Christ!!!, how fucking hard is it to track or log the petitions that you handle? I have software that helps me to identify customers- it tells us about their previous calls, or in this case it would be petitions. A tool like this would allow GM's to identify customers that were truly &quot;exploiting&quot; with /petition res requests and they could deal with those individuals as offenders- but for me... When I /petition it is because something that was not supposed to happen in the game happened, and I want a GM's to 1: Report the technical issue to their development teams and 2: not make me suffer a death due to a technical issue<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
The petition tracking tool is a useless idea, what you are trying to say is that if someone is petitioning for a res and they have only petitioned once then they must not be an exploiter, whereas if someone has petitioned 50 times then they must be guilty of exploiting because they petition a lot. I am sorry but once again that logic simply does not work.<br>
<br>
I assure you when you petition that the information is passed on to the technical team, every guide must file a report of EVERYTHING that has happened on their entire shift. I have played for 2 and a half years and died once to a bug, it was the Sol B zoning bug, I petitioned a guide and was ressed 10 minutes later, may I ask you how many times you have died to a bug? You sure make it sound like it is a daily occurance for you.<br>

Dont back down now, you weren't just dissing Verant in your first post, you tried to shove it up guides and GM's too. Put yourself in their shoes before you spout off ignorant bullshit, after all you can't have the first clue about being a guide or GM untill you have actually been one.<br>

<br>
p.s. It's 6am here and thus this wasn't really a rebuttal to your statments but rather an eye roll and a sigh that you again opened your smelly pie holes.<br>

As for Dwark's reputation, in game, I haven't heard any valid criticism of it.  Although there are a lot of people on the board that are critical of his conduct here (and I've been a vocal one), the same is not true in game (aside from a lame former guildie whose challenges were thoroughly trashed).<br>

I find it higly amusing how you call me &quot;close minded&quot;, (I have taken the liberty of assuming you meant closed minded), when you yourself claim that everything I say is wrong. Did you go to school to learn how to open your mouth and look like a retard or is it a natural ability?<br>

Verant has become much too large to have the inadequate customer support that it does.  I've been in IT for a number of years now and cannot believe their lack of good customer support.  They dont have an &quot;800&quot; number to call.  The volunteer guides are restricted entirely too much to be helpful in all but a few situations.  If you need to talk to the &quot;SERVER GM&quot;  which is needed all too often.. I hope you live in a part of the world and have a work schedule that accommodates that ONE person that is responsible for helping thousands.  For someone like myself who works 3PM to midnight.. I'm kind of screwed.  I guess I dont deserve quality support as much as someone with a 9-5 job.  Of course, you can go to Sony's website and fill out a detailed form.  That is so they can email you back telling you &quot;THANKS. Look at these FAQ pages.  If they dont help you, post all this detailed info AGAIN.. somewhere else.&quot;  To people making remarks about abuse of LD.  I dont care who did what in 1999.  This is 2002 and Verant released a product.. apparently long before it was ready to be released to the public.  Before making remarks, please enter the general chat room and sit for an hour or so.  This should be sufficient for you to grasp the scope of issues people are receiving from the SOL release.  I was LD 3 days ago with a character active online for OVER 2 HOURS.  Gee.. what are the chances of a mob walking by me over the course of 2 hours as I cant log back on.... about 100% if I'm out somewhere fighting.  One poor soul had an active character online for OVER 3 hours... and still couldn't get a GM to worldkick.  I'm sure his character was fine sitting out there for that length of time.  With the number of problems caused by their latest release, you'd figure that Verant would be more accommodating to their customer base who are still attemping to play with countless problems and next to no customer support.<br>
<br>
Thanks for your time.<br>

I think you are missing my point- I'll clarify that what I was saying about people pulling the plug and intentionaly going LD had nothing to do with making a 60th level character or giving anyone any &quot;uder&quot; equipment.<br>
<br>
More to the point- let me ask you just how long does it take you to get back into the game after a LD... mind you that there are different types of LD that happen-- sometimes bumping you back to server select screen, sometimes bumping you back out to the windows desktop. Sometime just being sooo Laggy that your character is frozen for 2 or 3 min at a time- unable to move or defend yourself, I consider this a type of LD death.<br>
<br>
The first type takes me about 6 to 10 min to get back in (usually to discover that i'm naked at bind point because most of the time IG I spend in battle- and after going LD the Mob continued to pummel me.  <br>
The second type of LD, 99 out of a 100 times forces me to reboot my computer completely which can move this time frame up to around 15 or 20 min before I can get back in to the game- so even if I wasn't fighting at the time of LD, it is VERY likely that something just wandered by agro'd and killed me.<br>
<br>
Try to remember that I'm aproaching this not from a scammers point of view- I don't feel that when I get booted from the EQ server due to a technical issue that I should then have to spend time doing a CR and work for hours to regain the exp I lost. <br>
This also is another point I was trying to make... Verant has this LD policy because of scammers who want to pull the plug everytime the are about to Die, and this policy screws the other 99.99% of the people IG that play honestly.  I really don't care if another person pulls the plug 50 times while he is online- I do care when I don't pull the plug and I die from LD- Verant treats everyone like scammers when it comes to their LD policy- my suggestion was to give the GM's the ability to track those people and you shot that down.<br>
<br>
Another point I was trying to get across with the previous post was that if somebody wanted to pull the plug everytime before they died- I wouldn't care- and neither should anyone else... they pay their fees like everyone else and if somebody wants to spend 15 or 20 min rebooting and reloading the game each time they are about to buy the farm then 1: I don't care and 2: I can see why they would do it because the 20 min reboot time beats the 3 hours it takes to do the CR and regain the exp lost. <br>
<br>
If you want to impliment a difficulty slide bar I think that is a great idea. Let that bar affect the amount of exp lost when you die. I'll turn mine all the way off and you can keep yours at max. Why you would want to do that is beyond me, all I can think of is that you are a sadist and like pain as much as you like to argue.<br>
<br>
Pulling the plug everytime that you are about to die would IMO not be all that great an idea anyhow, it certainly would not help anyone to get &quot;uder&quot; loot. And it really would not be a smart thing to do on raids, or in groups.  <br>
Imagine that CHeal is just about to land and ya pull the plug thinking ohhh nooo im gunna dieee- well now you go LD, your cleric gets wiped, everyone then gets wiped- its just bad overall.  LD is bad rather it be intentional or unintentional.<br>
<br>
Dwark- I don't see why you would be opposed to the GM's having a software package that would allow them to track /petitions. It would seem to me that anything I suggest to empower the GM's and give them more tools to track and root out the real offenders in the game would be a good idea to everyone (except the exploiters)<br>
<br>
Furthermore, my origional post which you quoted and picked apart was a rant due to a recent LD I had experienced where what happened was a bug, and I died - the GM's were powerless to help (res) me because of Verant's policies.<br>
  <br>
For this I was frustrated at GM's and furious at Verant.  I asked the GM that I /petitioned about a contact phone number or a name of a person I could speak to at sony- and the best she could produce was an e-mail address that auto replies with links to FAQ pages.  There is no customer service and no contact between sony and its customers other than the GM's. Thus my flame was directed at the GM's and Verant because the whole situation stinks.<br>
<br>
I would agree that the GM's are a much needed part of EQ and that they do and many times I'm sure have been very helpful to users (replacing items, resing due to documented bugs, etc) but when it came to my situation with LD death they were useless, thus my flame.<br>
<br>
I don't presume to have the best answer to this problem, but my flame was just that, a rant and flame, directed at GM's and Verant because the curerrent LD policy stinks. IMO- the game is waaay to buggy to not have a better tracking software for GM's- strangeness happens all over and just because it may not be a &quot;documented bug&quot; at the time it happens does not mean that a GM could not use their better judgment to choose to correct a problem caused by something technical. BUT- under the current policy they are not allowed to do this.<br>
<br>
I don't like verant assuming that my &quot;/petition res request due to LD &quot; is a scam simply because they can not track the people who are actually abusing or exploiting the game. I am not a scammer and you Verant need to find a way to not treat me like one- this is called customer service. <p>_____________________
