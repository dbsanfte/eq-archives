NOW you're accusing your former officers of stealing from the guild bank . . . including me.<br><br>Don't you DARE drag my name into such an unwholesome and false accusation.<br><br>It's crap like this that drove us away from RE . . . the blatant favoritism that Gorndax shows you is sickening, especially when it's well known that your whims twist like a branch in the wind.  One moment Player X is your best friend in the world.  The next you're stabbing them in the back.  It wasn't worth it for us to deal with *you* and your craziness anymore, so we left.  <br><br>Yes, there were other issues, such as loot allocation and how corrupt yours and Gorndax's favoritism had become . . . oh, yeah, the night Gorndax announced the roll for the Crimson Robe of Alendine, and I was one of only two casters in the random . .  and then he decided not to roll at all but instead sell it &quot;for the guild bank&quot; was classic.  You don't @#%$ announce a roll and then yank it back from under the people involved.  So if my bitching about it and getting to have the robe was &quot;stealing&quot; from the guild bank, then more power to me . . . I'm STILL wearing it.  It was a @#%$ UPGRADE . . . (If you wanted to sell something for the guild bank, how about that damn skellie pendant you liked wearing so much?  That thing was totally useless for non-fatties and yet you hoarded it like it was a RL wedding ring.)<br><br>I still treasure all the /tells I got from other people on that Fear raid telling me how they thought you and Gorndax were acting like asses.  You know what?  I *still* get tells like that.<br><br>Between this latest base accusation you've levelled against me and my friends of &quot;stealing&quot; from your guild bank, and the fact that Gorndax wanted to come to WW and KS Myga from us, I've had it.  Leave EH alone.  Or can you?  Because the more you point fingers at other people accusing them of horrible deeds, it seems you're getting desperate to deflect attention away from how much you, yourself, suck. <p><BR><FONT COLOR="#66FF00">Barrymore Yorke, levelling since the dawn of time<BR>Founding Member of Erollisi's Heart<BR>"I want to sing Kumbaya with a still-beating heart in my hand." -- Barrymore Yorke<BR>"He is red!

I think EH is a worthless, piece of @#%$ guild that’s based around lying and deceiving thieves.  Yes Ironlutes comment about members of EH stealing from the bank is true because you chained SS gear that wasn’t supposed to go to Kemora behind my back when it was to be allocated to others.  Its sad how you cant trust guildies, and that’s why I removed Charmian from the guild and removed Kemora from being an officer.  You simply left after that because you werent going to get you way.  The guild is much stronger without having to deal without the likes of you.<br><br>Apparently getting a Benevolence Robe and a Necro fear robe on the same day, wasn’t enough to satisfy your hunger you still wanted another robe.<br><br>Now you little ass are gonna listen.  I will do what’s best for my guild and I don’t give a @#%$ about EH.  You learn your friends are not your friends when you cant trust them anymore and stab you in the back.   Each and every single one of you that left thought that you deserved items from the guild and that you were better than others in it.  Get a clue and you will realize that teamwork and improving everyone in the guild is far more important than thinking you personally deserve things so you should be head man in charge.<br><br>People know me well enough to say that I am a pretty good judge of character.  I will treat everyone with a golden hand until you screw me over... and half the members in your guild disgust me to no end.  I think they are dirt and slime and I don’t give a @#%$ if you point your fingers at me and tell me I suck.  You sir are scum, filth, insignificant @#%$ that should just fade off and die.  Wear your god damn tag proudly that reads “We formed by being thrown out because we stole SS armor”.  <br><br>Have a nice day.<br><br>PS.  Never, ever, accuse me of not distributing my loot right or favouritism.  Just because I don’t think it should go to people that expect it doesnt mean I don’t favor little shits like you.  I honestly hope you did your research and asked each of my guildies if they thought the loot my officers and myself do was fair.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br><br> <p><a href="http://pub54.ezboard.com/bradianteclipse"><img src="http://www.telusplanet.net/public/geraldt2/images/gornsig.jpg" border="0"></a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uunclegorndax.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Uncle Gorndax</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 354<br> <font color=#E9D756>(8/1/02 11:28:29 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3522.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> The term &quot;you&quot; was in prespective of members of EH as you were talking about EH as a whole.

I had the Robe of Bevelolence -- a quest robe I had to pull people's teeth to get 'em to come to WW to help with, by the way -- a good three weeks before the Crimson Robe of Alendine dropped.  Amazing how you've managed to compress nearly a month down into a single day.  Wow, we went to WW and got Scout Charisa, I got the Robe of Benevolence, then we went to Fear on the SAME day, the Crimson Robe of Alendine dropped and I stole it!  Woohoo!  Riiiiiight.  The Communists after WWII weren't able to rewrite history as well as you and Ironlute can.<br><br>You changed the @#%$ loot rules AFTER you called the random.  You were an a s s hole, and there are a zillion witnesses who were there to see it.  Your guild almost exploded that same day, schmuck.<br><br>Your loyalty to your girlfriend is commendable, but it stops being helpful to the people in your guild when her paranoia and mental instability are affecting everyone else.<br><br>She needs help, Gorn.  We tried sitting down with you and talking about it with you and you refused.  Anything to keep you in power, right?  We kept trying to tell you what was wrong and you kept telling us that if we were loyal to you, we'd shut up about Ironlute.  Loyalty . . . like you were King Arthur.  Well, you're not @#%$ King Arthur.  You're a kid in your early 20's with a power complex that you got through sitting on your ass at a computer, and a girlfriend who has serious issues dealing with reality.  <br><br>We ultimately left RE because you guys couldn't address your own issues and decided to blame everyone else.  And you know what?  Life has been GOOD since then, man.  The game has been FUN again.  EH is comprised of the kindest, most caring individuals I have ever met in the game.  I have never seen the slightest indication that they could possibly be able to steal any items, as Ironlute and you keep accusing.  However, I know EXACTLY how much you and Ironlute are capable of backstabbing, because you've done it to us ever since we left and formed Erollisi's Heart.  <br><br>I used to respect you.  You were the best pickup raid leader in the game, and seemed to be a helluva guy.  But a pickup raid leader doesn't make a good guild leader, especially when the guild leader makes his RL girlfriend his second in command.  That, RIGHT THERE, makes for compromised leadership, because whatever the girlfriend wants, she's gonna get.  Whoever the girlfriend wants forced out, will be forced out.  And whoever the girlfriend accuses, you'll back her up on.  I pity you both of you.<br><br> <p><BR><FONT COLOR="#66FF00">Barrymore Yorke, levelling since the dawn of time<BR>Founding Member of Erollisi's Heart<BR>"I want to sing Kumbaya with a still-beating heart in my hand." -- Barrymore Yorke<BR>"He is red!
