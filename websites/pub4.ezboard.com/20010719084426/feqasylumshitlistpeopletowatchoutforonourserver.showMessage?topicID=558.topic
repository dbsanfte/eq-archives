Tonight, one of my guildmates, a fellow Cleric, Brashier trusted someone in the attempt of selling his Wurmslayer. He made a Mistake of TRUSTING, I understand this. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  But, I was able to confront the individual who I conducted the transaction with. I had a conversation with him, and got his point of view. I logged the whole thing, and, edited out the unrelated spam.<br>

Just the other day, I saw a low-lvl naked Troll Warrior begging for items in EC, with almost the EXACT same name (diff maybe 1 letter). Man, I wish I would have read this earlier, I would have shouted to the entire tunnel and made sure he never got a thing. <br>
<br>
I personally fell this guy, based on this account, is an asshole. I hope enough people read this, and this thief never gets into another group.

one can live within the laws and be at the bottom of the barrel, case in point nazi germany.  The genocide of the Jews was completely within in the law of germany, now you can claim you did nothing wrong but the observers see your actions for what they are.  This action in no way has the same weight as the atrocity in nazi germany, it was merely an example of how making something legal doesnt make it right.<br>
<br>
Im glad you got a wurmslayer, I hope you can solo with it.<br>
<br>
Worthy, I wish there was a solution.  But as all scammers know, and as frizz said "how can you steal in EQ".   Theres nothing that can be done, from what I know.  Perhaps this fool will realize that hes a scum bag, and make things right.   <p> <a href="mailto:dreamingwolfmail@home.com"><img src="http://www.fortunecity.com/bennyhills/flower/152/dwsig.gif" border="0"></a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/umendan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mendan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t d00d!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(6/3/01 8:29:48 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Luminescence.

      How are you all doing today?  Feeling good?  Sit back and enjoy.<br>
      First off, I'd like to apologize for all the trouble I caused for the GM involved in this shit(Frizznik), who had to put up with you idiots whining to him about something that shouldn't have been any worse than one person petitioning about it.  <br>
      Second, does another wrong make a right?  Is it hardly fair that when I even attempted to hunt any further Grakkus would just waste my targets continually until I just sat and waited for him to go away.<br>
      Third, frankly, I don't give a damn.  I don't care about items, or this stupid list.  Anyhow, later on I told Worthy that I will give back the weapon...along with all of my stuff, because I don't give a damn.  I had fun dealing with everyone.  So am really not such a bad guy, am I?

  This guy was begging off my level 52 druid in the tunnel on I think it was Saturday morning.  He was naked though, guess he put all his equipment in bags before he started his little scam.<br>
  What a worthless piece of shit, can't even play EQ without cheating.<br>
  You remember me dont' you luminescence?  You were &quot;roleplaying&quot; your begging to Garnette, my druid.  And I told you &quot;NO&quot; then you whined for awhile about how you had made some bad trades.  You were still sending me tells when I wasn't even in the zone anymore.  How was it that you made some bad trades?  You got a wurmslayer, you assh**e.<br>
  All I gotta say is &quot;YOU ARE PATHETIC&quot;  You screwed someone from a very honorable guild and also a very large one.<br>
  I just read Worthy's second post and I had to laugh, isn't it funny how these guys always have some evil twin that plays their accounts too?<br>
  LMAO you will be on 100's of people shit list by the end of this afternoon.  You are on mine for sure.<br>
  Worthy I'm so sorry to hear about your guildmate, if there is anything I can do please send me a tell. <br>

Troll Thief and Liar.</span><hr size=1> Hmmm...this one is a bit strange.<br>
<br>
The guy claims that he's borrowing the character from a friend (let's not get into the whole &quot;it's against Veran'ts rules&quot; crap. We know). His friend, who owns the account, is the one who stole the Wurmslayer.<br>
<br>
He knows his friend did it. It sounds as if he was there when it happened. Especially since he was the one who responded when confronted by Worthy both times, and on this list.<br>
<br>
Now, what would YOU do? A real life friend did something in a game that was wrong. He's ruining HIS character's reputation. While you're using the character, someone confronts you with this. You're well aware of what happened, in fact you know it happened because you were watching when it did. The player confronting you gives you a chance to salvage some of the character's rep and turn in the item you stole.<br>
<br>
Do you turn it in?<br>
<br>
I honestly don't know what I would do. To be honest, if a friend of mine did that I'd talk him into turning it back in to the person he stole it from. But I don't think I'd do it myself. It's not my account, and I'd rather have someone pissed at a character that's not even mine, than to have a RL friend pissed at me for doing something without his permission.<br>
<br>
Not that I'm defending either of the jerks who use this account. The one who stole it in the first place is wrong. The one who's antagonizing everyone about it is just as bad.<br>
