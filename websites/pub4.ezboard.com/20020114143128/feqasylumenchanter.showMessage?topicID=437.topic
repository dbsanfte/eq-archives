However, I notice that the for quest givers will not really do much for you until you give them the seal.  Now, I have the Ink of the Dark and I have a SMR to get the mechanical pen.  My question is how hard is it to kill the bandit in EK?  Can 1 group of mid 50's do it or do you need a few groups?  How magic resistant is the bandit?<br>
<br>
Also if anyone responds that has completed the quest, what, in your opinion, was the hardest mob to kill and how hard is the bandit compared to that?  Now I am not referring to the rarity of the spawn or the difficulty of getting to the mob.  I am talking about how tough that mob was once engaged in battle.  Any help is appreciated. <p><CENTER>

<br>
If you mean mid 50s as in like 56 ish tanks, and 55 ish others.. yeah you can do it with a single group.  I always felt that overkill was good on these, since you were dragging people around to help you, make SURE you have enough to get the mob dead the first time ( personal opinion ).<br>
<br>
As for our mobs, every mob we have to do ( besides the hate and fear mobs ), could be done by a single, well equipped, group of 57+ .<br>
<br>
As you subtract levels, you need to add people.<br>
<br>
Here is what i would take to the specifc mobs, keeping in mind that i am aware it can be done with less, and i like overkill.<br>
( for my definitions, &quot;low 50s&quot; = 50-54, and &quot;upper 50s = 55+. The main tank level tends to be most important, so, go for the highest level main tank you can, preferably 57+, as the mobs are generally 55)<br>
<br>
Thraken Griften  <br>
<br>
1 1/2 to 2 groups of low 50s.  <br>
1 group of upper 50s ( level of tank fairly important)<br>
<br>
MR mob, not slowable to my knowledge.<br>
Difficulty = easy <br>
Mob special attacks = none.. melee based mob<br>
Approximate spawn time = Triggered<br>
<br>
Strategy <br>
Get your people over to his spawn site in the bandit camp.  Bind yourself there as well, and then run to go turn in the paper to the chick.  Gate back, and rune your tank if you need to.  Agro management is fairly important if you can manage it , keep agro on your Main tank if possible.<br>
<br>
Verina Tomb<br>
<br>
2 groups of low 50s, 1 group of mid 50s<br>
NOT mr, although stuns dont work as she is level 60<br>
Mob Slowable ( tash first if having difficulty)<br>
Mob special attacks = Cleric based mob. will nuke with magic based nukes, and Complete heal herself if allowed to.<br>
Difficulty = easy<br>
Approximate spawn time 2-4 days random spawn ( 48 to 96 hours )<br>
<br>
strategy<br>
<br>
Pull her to the zone line in third gate with a non kos person ( YOU the enchanter makes a good person ).  Beat her down right at the zone line.  Tash her and slow her, and have your tanks beat on her.  You can sieve her as well, as she will C heal.  Shes pretty much cake, as she is probably the easiest level 60 mob to kill in the game.  She wastes mana trying to nuke folks ( put GRM on everyone ), then tries to C heal.  Zone if you are worried about faction hit but i dont remember one.<br>
<br>
Vessal Drozlen<br>
<br>
2 groups of mid to upper 50s, 3+ groups of low 50s <br>
(yes i am aware this can be done with 6 people.. i prefer overkill and this is a mob that is fairly close with one higher level group )<br>
<br>
Difficulty = med <br>
Mob Not slowable<br>
Mob Special Attacks = Harm touch ( a big one too, if you take it).  He typically uses this on passing level one mobs, so, you generally dont have to worry about it.<br>
Approximate spawn time = 48 - 96 hours (not up on server patch)<br>
<br>
Strategy<br>
<br>
Zone in thru field of bone.  Hopefully bring a CoH mage with you, as it makes moving people there MUCH easier.  Stay invis and jump into the water, and follow the left wall.  Under the dock on the left side is a tunnel.  Swim into the tunnel, and come up for air in the air pockets.<br>
<br>
At the second place you can actually jump out, do so.  Look straight up, and push against the wall and you should &quot;pop&quot; out.  Follow the right wall ( staying invis ) and you should see vessal drozlin if he is up.  If you get to a big otagonal room that has a hole in the ceiling, you went too far.<br>
<br>
Push him into the wall where he spawns.  He hits for 300s i believe, and is also MR ( fire and other elemental nukes hit fine tho i believe).  He will attempt to run through a one way door.  Agro management is important, so , again bring the highest level main tank you can find, a cleric, and a secondary type healer too ( druid / shaman ).<br>
<br>
Tangrin<br>
<br>
Same force for Vessal<br>
Difficulty = med<br>
Mob not slowable<br>
Mob special features = Monkey stun.. a proc stun.  Pump up MR to resist ( and have decent levels )<br>
approximate spawn time 24 hours ( mabye less.. it was always up when i saw it )<br>
<br>
Strategy<br>
Basically since vessal and Tangrin are in same general area, these should be done together.  Move your force over to the island WITHOUT the big wall on it, and buff there.<br>
<br>
When buffing is done, main tank should charge island with wall ( tangrin is here ), and engage.  If your tanks are low 50s you are in for a lot of pain, since the stun is deadly. If it lands, your tank is stunned for like 5-7 seconds or longer.. and gets eaten alive basically.  If you have a high level tank to gain agro, they most likely will resist the stun with Decent MR, and also hold agro to prevent others from being procced on.<br>
<br>
GET a high level tank for this one of at all possible.<br>
<br>
Again, rune your main tank as needed to support a C healing cleric, but try not to draw agro on yourself.<br>
<br>
Ghost of Kindle ( the hole )<br>
<br>
1 group familiar with the hole and 55+<br>
2+ groups normally <br>
Mob slowable ( i think )<br>
Mob special attacks = none i remember.. if you can GET to her, you can kill her easy <br>
difficulty = mob easy... getting there can be hard if your not sure where you are going.  This is normally a raid so should be pretty easy.<br>
Approximate spawn time 30 minutes ( yep, get for all your enchanters on the raid while you are here )<br>
<br>
Strategy<br>
This is normally done as a raid, and since so many people need epic parts here it is usually easy for an enchanter to jump on a shaman epic raid.  The following classes need epic parts in the hole at some point :<br>
<br>
Enchanter<br>
Shadowknight<br>
Ranger<br>
Shaman<br>
Paladin<br>
<br>
If you are on a raid, simply listen to the raid leader.  If it is a one group thing, the people you are with should be familiar with the hole.. Only advice i can give here is the hole is not like regular dungeons.<br>
<br>
53+ things in this dungeon can not be mezzed, or charmed due to old world mez rules.  This means that it is important things get slowed ASAP ( should have a shaman there anyhow), and root parked if unmezzable.  If you cant dazzle it, it cant be mezzed there period.  GoK, or Rapture wont work ( i havent tried rapture but have been told it doesnt work either ).<br>
<br>
Prince in Charodk<br>
1 group of 60s with a FD puller<br>
normally a 18+ person raid, with average levels of 54+.<br>
Mob slowable<br>
Mob special attacks = Prince casts / procs a G flux type stun spell.  Levels and MR are the key to resisting it. <br>
Mob difficulty = medium<br>
<br>
Strategy<br>
This is normally a &quot;Royals&quot; raid, as by the time you get down to the prince there is no reason you shouldnt proceed to do the king for clerics, and mabye even the queen for warriors.<br>
<br>
The rest of his room is more difficult than he himself is, and requires a decent puller to split.  This particular pull is one of the more fun times in the game for an enchanter, as it is normally somewhere between 3 and 9 high level (54+ ish ) mobs that need to be brought under control quickly.<br>
<br>
The prince himself is usually never a problem to kill, provided you live through the pulling of his room.<br>
<br>
Wraith of Jaxiom<br>
<br>
1 upper 50s group ( 56+)<br>
2+ groups of Low to mid 50s<br>
Mob is slowable ( doesnt need to be killed though )<br>
Mob special features = none i remember<br>
Approximate spawn = random <br>
<br>
Strategy <br>
<br>
Jump onto a shaman epic raid if you can.  These are happening fairly often, and the wraith can be pulled for charming if its up.  Would reccomend Boltrans as the charm spell of choice , but have been told you dont even need allure for him ( i know an enchanter that did this part pre 50 ).<br>
<br>
If you are serious about this part, and can jump on a raid you can get a group to stay with you around where it spawns till it pops. It is semi rare, so no clue how long you will wait.<br>
<br>
Cazel<br>
<br>
1 group of mid 50s<br>
1 and 1/2 groups of low 50s<br>
(Bring a shaman, and or a necro for disease dots).<br>
Mob is slowable<br>
Mob special features = massive regen. disease dots really help on this.<br>
approximate spawn = random, but usually up at least once a day.<br>
Difficulty = easy (very)<br>
<br>
Strategy<br>
<br>
Cazel is simple. Fear kite him.  His MR is very low, and , with a tash he will fear quite easily.  Bring a snare class, and a disease dotting class, and a tank and your good to go.<br>
<br>
Small group Cazel kills typically look like :<br>
<br>
necro ( disease dots and pet of course )<br>
Enchanter (you of course)<br>
Tank ( high damage like rogue is great )<br>
Druid ( backup heals, and long lasting snare )<br>
<br>
or<br>
<br>
Shaman (disease dots,)<br>
Enchanter<br>
Tank ( again, rogue preferred )<br>
Druid (backup heals and long lasting snare )<br>
<br>
You only need a cleric for this one if you make a mistake, have REALLY bad rolls on the fear casts, or are too low level.  Snare , Fear, Dot.. tank whacks... dead cazel.<br>
<br>
Shissar and Esscence are fear and hate raids respectively, so, wont be covered here.  If they are up, your raid will probably kill them for you.<br>
<br>
Shissar is random 48 - 96 hours it seems, and esscense is totally random.<br>
<br>
<br>
This is all probably more detailed than you wanted, but ../shrug... thought it might have some useful information for more than one person.<br>

No place on his island is really safe from aggroing him.<br>
<br>
I also had overkill for most everything we killed...I guess I got so excited whenever I found something up that peeps couldn't say no to  helping me, and a ton came. :P  Also, everyone is ready to do favors for a chanter. :P <p><img src="http://www.annastazia.homestead.com/files/adjani.jpg" alt="Adjani Tristesse, Goddess of Lanys"></img>

<br>
One thing to note though is that Wraith of Jaxiom does not have to be charmed by the person handing in the gem. When I got mine there were three chanters there to turn in the gem to him, and I'm the one that held charm the whole time. So, if you have trouble charming him, have a higher enchanter do it for you.<br>
<br>
I'm pretty sure this is always the case here, unless someone knows otherwise.<br>
