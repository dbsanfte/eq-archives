Someone else that got screwed by the same person?  Chances are that won't happen until he screws the next person over and then Lelleasha can offer verification to THAT shit list post.  This is a case of one person's word versus another.  He stole an item worth 5 or 6K PP and his name should stay up here so other people know to avoid him.  If he comes here and explains his actions, and people verify his good name....then lock it.  If he knows his name is going to be cleared within a few days then why would he even bother defending himself?<br>
<br>
I for one would stand by Lells word over just about anyone.  I'm not sure if that's enough &quot;verification&quot; but I'm quite certain that many others would say the same thing.<br>
<br>
As for everyone jumping on Lell for being &quot;gullible&quot;, heck I did the same thing when I heard about this (More jokingly than anything).  But it's not all as cut and dry as you may think.  There MUST be some level of trust in this game.  If I join a pickup group that's doing the Crypt in Sebilis I don't expect them to suddenly disband me and then watch as the rest of the group evacs out, yet a death with no rez at this level is worth a heck of a lot more than 5 or 6K to me.....should I no longer group with people I don't know or trust?  <br>
<br>
Lelleasha lost the item cuz she's a trusting person.  She's not here whining about it but rather here to warn others.  Just remember the name and move on, sounds like he'll be cleared from the shitlist in a few days <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon2.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/udaeddwin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Daeddwin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>p0\/\/3r-p0sT3r!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(6/19/01 8:30:52 am)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Phosphoross/Xeinaga</span><hr size=1> Well, it seems to me like the majority of SL posts in the past few weeks have been third-party trade scams.  EQ has a secure trade window.  A third-party trade is just a way around it.  I have no intention of making any such trades myself, and if I do and get burned I've got nobody to blame but myself.  If I did and someone scammed me, they'd still be a bad person... but it wounds to me like everybody's sick of warning the entire world about this kind of situation.<br>
<br>
Really, this is not a hard situation to avoid.  While there does need to be some level of trust between people in the game, just try to think whether or not you'd be willing to trust someone you don't know at all with 6k-8k plat.  Would you trust someone you've never seen before with a hundred dollars?  Ask them to hand over the money first, then you'll hand over the item.  If they won't extend YOU that level of trust, why should you extend it to them?<br>

   Let me ask you this.  When you go to a store and purchase groceries, do you tell the clerk,  "I'll be right back with my money but I'm taking the groceries home with me."<br>
  I would love to live in a world where you don't have to lock your doors and you can trust everyone in your town, but it just isn't the case.  This extends to EQ also, if not more so, because of all the fucking thieving little children that play this game and were never taught to respect other people or to not cheat.  Let me rephrase that, because all these assholes out there probably aren't just children, God knows some of these scum bags are adults also.<br>

The seller should have no responsibility for giving the item to a person twinks, that should be the buyers responsibility.  However, if the seller does offer to be nice and the buyer betrays the sellers trust this buyer has become a mithra-dru.<br>

Itzlegend himself was guilty of this kind of trade with Amortae's 56 Pet. He ok'd the female version of Maldan to give Amortae the Spell and then I log'd on Cinan to pay for it. At one point in the trade Amortae had the scroll and Conquest had nothing in return. I was amazed Itzlegend trusted my guys enough to do that.  I was dealing with a Guild that people only screw over once this is true, But the point is trust was given by a person and Guild who just as easily could have said &quot;get the coin and then we'll talk&quot;. I will always appreciate Itz and Conquest for doing that. People who take advantage of this kind of trade need to be posted here in an index of names that never falls to the back pages, like a &quot;Who's Who among Norrathian dirt bags&quot;.<br>

I'm risking my life in an automobile with 3 other folks taking an equal risk and sure they might push me out at 60mph+, but I doubt it.  Same thing with grouping.  You're all taking equal risks, but when you rip someone off like this it is intentional and usually premeditated.  It's called fraud and it's nasty as it is taking advantage of folks just like you and I at no risk to themselves as they see it.  Verant does nothing about this any longer as the person just has to say &quot;hey they gave it to me and it's mine&quot; in their defense.  That's why they put the trade security in.  To save them time on follow ups.  If you value the item enough to complain about it not being yours anymore it's worth a little extra effort to not get screwed.  Just my 2cp and I'm sure I'll get slammed for this but it's just plain truth and we all know it.

But they're right Lellie, you really need an intermediary before you do 3rd party trades, or make them give you the pp first.  After all, a level 59 character is much less likely to screw over their reputation for 5kpp than say a level 20 person would... <br>

I guess no one should trust anyone any more.  This is happening way to much.  <br>
<br>
Personally I hate selling/buying items period.  But when I have been the seller, and they say someone else is going to pay, I say bring your other char to pay and that is who gets the item.  They can find a friend or guildie they trust to transfer the item later.  Some do and some don't go for this.  I figure those that don't were just going to scam me too or they don't have anyone they trust to do the trade. /shrug.  <br>
<br>
What's Lanys and the rl world coming to when you cann't trust anyone any more?<br>
<br>
Atleast there are still many in Lanys that I can trust only because I group with them alot or know them by reputation and that they would never do anything to ruin their rep on the server.  Since its your rep that you really only have. <p><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#FF00FF"><b><I>Tsulyra Shadowhawk</I></b></font><br>
