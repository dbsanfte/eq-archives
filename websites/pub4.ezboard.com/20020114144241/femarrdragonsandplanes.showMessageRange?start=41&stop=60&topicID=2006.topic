I think it's about survival.  You remove the worst parts of the group so they don't harm others and don't influence others.  Then again,  it's just this simple: You killed someone, the punishment is to be killed, so he was killed.  It's not anywhere near that simple though and I'm not going to try to explain all the ways that society as a whole reacts to these situations.  What I will do is point you to a book that stands out in my mind as a very concise and absolutely brilliant look at just these things:<br>

Then you can all sit around and talk about why it's so damn good that they weren't put to death.  That is if you could talk them out of raping and killing you long enough to do so.<br>

The man took the lives of several children and adults. IMHO the death penalty was too light a punishment. Personally I would have tortured him and fed his testicles (still attached) to wolves and then killed him. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
No offence taken jae ,<br>
But you state it yourself , death penalty is to light .<br>
apart from the killing him off , I would probably agree on tortures and such .<br>
<br>
<br>
I was nearly killed a few months ago as well , Got a bullet 1 inch above my heart while protecting a kid and my other teammembers grapped that guy.<br>
He was a kosovarien , So what did my country do ? right , send him back .<br>
<br>
But still , even if he would have killed me , I wouldnt agree to kill that guy . let him face his crimes every day ,Let him realise he was wrong to kill someone ,and then keep rubbing it in .<br>
In the end , they will go nuts (any normal being that is)<br>
Then again : If i would have passed away , It wouldnt be like 168. Maybe comparing seller to mcveigh is wrong , but I just compared them because they both got killed in the same state .<br>
Next tuesday is the next one , I so hope they grant this guy merci , so he can work for the rest of his day's to the community , but that would be the same like asking god to show his pretty face on earth I think .<br>
<br>
Still , it is good to see what you guys opinions are, and I am glad there was no actually flaming involved <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Timothy McVeigh had an interview only a month or two ago had still says he has zero remorse.   So he can't live with his regret because he has none.   And I don't know current figures, but 6 years ago it cost over 100,000 dollars a year to keep one death row aka maximum security prisoner alive.   Now their life is already forfeit anyways.  Why should we then, the taxpayers, pay for someone like that to sit in prison and watch cable tv, lift weights, learn a trade skill, attend law school classes (yes, its been done), while we bust our butts in the real word, don't murder people, and could use the tax dollars for better things.  I know my tax money would be better spent paying teachers what they deserve, or better healthcare, rather than keeping some guy alive at over 100,000 dollars a year.  <br>
<br>
Unfortunately the Death Penalty is a touchy subject here because so many folks feel its unfair.  Still, if he dies, it will truly be in the hands of God then.   And finally, to the folks that love to tell me that the death penalty doesnt work, I ask you to prove to me that someone has been put to death by the death penalty is out killing more innocent people that don't deserve to die.<br>
<br>
Then go tell the mothers of those kids, and the families of those workers, that that man should be allowed to live and breathe, when all those folks were doing were their jobs, or for the children, playing in a nursery.    They should have been allowed to live and breathe as well, but he took that away from them all.   It may be old testament, but an eye for an eye does put a stop to it.<br>
<br>
Just my two bits, and hope that sheds light on it for you folks that don't live in the USA and understand it.   Hell, some folks here don't understand it either.<br>

The guy was messed up he was against the goverment he didn't care who was in his way he had a mission and in his mind he carried it out. He killed lots of people you all need to think bout them and forget McVeigh some crazy fuck. You all talk bout the crazy shit you would do to him... does that make you just as fucked up as him? Personaly I think as soon as he was found guilty and admited what he did that day he should of been taking down shot and that be the end of the story. It bothers me that everyone has to bring it up I didn't wanna post about it but I had to throw in my thoughts. Think about his family and the family's of the people that he effected that have to live with the daily pain.... No one wants to be known as the father the brother/sister mother of some fuck like that he got what was coming. He knew it he knew his actions would effect everyone in the moments that it took to kill him. Let yer thoughts be with them and let that sick fuck outta yer mind don't grant his wishes. It took too much time to rid of him and most of those other sick fucks out there 1 bullet burn the body throw it in the trash the end and no I couldn't nor wouldn't be the person to pull the trigger no matter my rage or hate for that killer. Then again maybe I could if someone effect my family in such a way. He didn't just effect 1 country but the world everyone knows his name everyone is effected in some way but not nearly as the victums.<br>

<br>
What a crock!  They should have either killed him with more pain, or made him bust big rocks into little ones for 50 years.<br>
<br>
Additionally to the 168 people that died, there were 3 unborn children that died as well.  171 lives killed!  That's deserving of a worse punishment than lethal injection!<br>

I also don't think we've heard the last of James Nichols.  He was quite defiant on the local TV channels last night here in Michigan.  If you don't remember him, he's the brother of Terry Nichols.  His house is supposedly where all the chemicals were acquired.  This guy is not stable either. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ucendan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Cendan</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/image/globalBlack.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 268<br> <font color=#E9D756>(6/12/01 5:12:04 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: way to go USA..</span><hr size=1> Scoppie, you made a good point... form now on we offer all people death OR xportation to <insert scoppie's country>.<br>

<br>
The death penalty is meant to be a deterant.  Commit a major crime like this one and they will kill you! No res, no leniency, no kidding!  You have to do some pretty messed up stuff to get the death penalty.<br>
<br>
My concern is that there is the possibility of an innocent man potenetially getting offed.<br>
<br>
On the other hand  - Kill the bastages!  I mean none of this lethal injection on closed circuit TV crap.  Public beheadings!  Stonings!  Rackings!  Disembowelment! All on Pay per View(to offset the costs you know)! Messed up mind games like the former Soviet system.  Make these bastards as uncomfortable and scared as possible, make them feel like their vicitms did.  Hell, even put them on a game show ala Running Man.  *conjours up a vision of Gladiators in his head*  An then maybe this will become an even stronger deterant.<br>
<br>
Ahh, I feel much better now........<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> It is not a deterrent. Every major study that has ever been done has demonstrated that it is not a deterrent.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
A death penalty seldom used is a poor deterrent. I agree with that. But...run that same study in Texas, the death penalty in Texas is a deterrent. Crime statistics are very clear. Violent, capital crimes are down over 25% in the State of Texas in the past 10 years. <br>
<br>
That is attributed to two things in Texas. The frequent use of the Death Penalty (which is used in Texas often and quickly) and the large number of citizens who, legally, carry concealed weapons. <br>
<br>
I agree that the possibility of putting someone innocent to death is a reason to seriously reconsider use of the death penalty in all but the most clear of cases. But then, I can't argue with the results you see in the State of Texas. Everyone who commits senseless or premeditated murder is almost assured of receiving the death penalty. <br>
<br>
If you are going to rarely use this form of punishment...no one will fear it. But if you use it with common regularity, making it a standard part of your judicial process. Criminals will fear it. <br>
<br>
My opinion? Use it more often, streamline the appeals process, make it a well oiled legal machine. <br>
<br>
And one other thing. People criticized George W. Bush for allowing so many executions during his tenure as Governor of the State of Texas. People criticize him for not stopping some of those executions. <br>
<br>
FYI...Governor of the State of Texas CANNOT stop an execution or pardon a criminal. He can put an execution on pause for 30 days and request the case be re-evalutated. The courts then convene a panel and determine whether they will appeal again, they rarely do. <br>
<br>
And as for complaints that the death penalty differs too much from one state to another...Welcome to the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. In most all situations, States create their own laws and govern their own legal systems. Only in the event that actions are taken against Federal Employees or on Federal Property does the US Government have some say. Or, if the crime is spread across state lines. Our constitution assures us that the States have a legal right to govern themselves. So, don't like the laws of your state? Move...<br>

<br>
<br>
An eye for an eye.  Someone kills someone they are less then human and need to be judged by their maker.  I dont think you fully understand how important the death penalty is until its one of your family members get killed by someone, then you understand the need for this type of closure.  <br>

     This man attacked a symbol of our government, in doing so he killed many officers of that government.  I don't like it but I can live with that.  However, this man also killed several children and for that he has earned a special place in hell.  It is our right, no our duty to make sure he is sent there asap.<br>
<br>
    In this man's twisted mind he is a hero of some sort.  The thought of people like him spreading their diseased thoughts to others makes me wretch.  In this country you may say as you wish about the government.  You do not try to make a point by killing innocent children.<br>
