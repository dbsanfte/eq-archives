You lied (which annoys me) and you bumped an old thread trying to smear an entire guild because two of its members (it's a pretty big guild according to their webpage) have done something questionable in the last 3-4 months.  Sounds like you're on the same crusade as Chiteng against Da'Kor, just with different names and even less cause.<br>
<br>
Great, now you remove the lie about the whole guild misleading SF and back it down to just Chieling.  Kinda too late for that after you've already blasted the whole guild for one persons action.  (Are you the player that was gonna get the bracer if it hadn't gone to Chieling?)  Point is, you intentionally misstated the facts in order to make RoD look more blameworthy without any justification.  Thankfully you can't go and edit your post to remove the lie.<br>

<br>
No.  The person who would have received the bracer was Cyril, an Affliction guildmember who initiated the quest with Charisa by turning in the toolkit.<br>
<br>
A few days after the incident with RoD, we completed the Charisa quest for Cyril with the help of a couple of SF members.<br>

<br>
If ninja looting isn't condoned by RoD, then in theory, Medicuus would be disbanded from RoD.  In theory, that is.  <br>
<br>
I seriously doubt MS has nothing better to do than start shit on a message board about nameless_cleric_01 for shits and giggles.  More than one MS person saw this action by Medicuus, and have posted that they saw this action, so why aren't they receiving any benefit of the doubt from RoD?  If they believe Med over MS, they are calling MS liars.<br>
<br>
Med is accused of ninja looting a pretty darn good item from a mob she had nothing to do with .. that was whacked by one of the top guilds on the server .. of which she is not a part of or assisted in.  This is a no brainer - keep your paws off it if isn't yours.   This crap line Medicuus feeds about worrying the corpse was going to rot is bullshit.  Who cares if it was going to rot.  Was the item hers/his?  Was the kill hers/his?  No, it wasn't.  If MS wanted to let every piece that ever dropped rot, does Medicuus have any say so in this matter?  N-O!  <br>
<br>
I was talking to a good friend of mine in RoD and he was telling me about their recruiting policies and other things in the guild.  One of the things he told me about was Medicuus .. she was described as a &quot;crab&quot; and that it's just something they put up with in RoD.  Yes, he actually said that. I still can't figure out why anyone would - she/he is not an officer or leader - the only thing she/he is, is a cleric.  If a guild needs a cleric so badly, they may keep it despite the reputation. of that cleric  Then again, it may be better to forego one cleric to save the reputation of a guild.  <br>
<br>
Like it or not, it seems RoD is on trial and smack dab in the spotlight because of the actions of one person.  Is it fair on a lot of the really good people in RoD?  No, not really.  However, there isn't much you can do to change public opinion once it's out there.  No one likes a ninja looter and everyone certainly remembers who they are and where they came from.  <br>
<br>
And they definately remember if anything was done about it.<br>

<br>
Log in the day after a patch and the beginning of Magister's Ntov week.  I just happened to log out at the safe camp near Vulak`Aerr and PoM.  I'm standing around the corner on the ramp side of the elbow-shaped area and there's a dragon corpse...let's say Sev or Cek *Shrug* doesn't matter really...I see no Magister around(because they're around the other side of the corner...duh).<br>
<br>
Do you think I could honestly exhonerate myself from looting said dragon corpse and gating out with an item from it with a lame excuse of &quot;I had just logged in, saw nobody around and figured it was going to rot&quot;???   Ya I'm sure Magister killed the dragon then just left the corpse to either A) log..or B) moved down to pull the bigass fish out of his water tank.<br>
<br>
It honestly doesn't matter if it was a WW dragon or a Ntov one, or a fucking giant corpse in the middle of kael.  You don't loot something you didn't help kill unless told to do so.  <br>
<br>
Reminds me of the fucking assholes that used to chase me around Steamfront trying to loot my gnome guards...or later on in EFP trying to loot Sheg/Topplo.<br>

I used one single word...They. I hate to break it to you but in the incident I spoke of, 'They' consisted of Chieling (a former FRIEND of mine) and a raid group of RoD members. None of them attempted to let us know that they had trained an affliction raid but instead let Chieling loot the bracer. At a later point, they (note the use of the word again.) did not perform any disciplinary action against said member, instead acting much like 'they' are doing in this thread. <br>
<br>
If you think that this has anything in comparison with what Chiteng is talking about in his Da'kor incident, then you really need to take reading comprehension courses. I would help you pay for them, but I have to keep money to keep the forces of 'they' at bay.<br>
<br>
Let me sum up. Another member of RoD has done something very wrong. They have taken something that was not theirs to take. The guild they are/were both part of has had one comment from an actual founding member/officer which basically says they don't support it and yet instead of doing anything about it, they will leave it between the member and MS. Now that makes a lot of fucking sense, don't you think? A member who has already shown that they are not to be trusted should settle this quietly between themselves and MS. I can honestly tell you that any guild worth their salt would at least have publicly apologized, offered to make up the issue, and booted the person responsible out of the guild. <br>
<br>
If 'they' don't do that, then of course I (and pretty much everyone else on this thread so far, except one troll, and a couple of sad fucks like yourself) will take 'them' to task on it.<br>
<br>
I didn't lie about anything, I merely didn't figure I would have to be so direct in my meaning that it could not be picked apart by pricks like you. You must be a fucking lawyer in RL.<br>

The weird thing about this is, I heard that this was resolved between the MS and RoD leaders and a solution had been reached.  I was told by a member of RoD, that they were going to WW to whack a dragon and allow the MS member of MS's choice to loot it.  <br>

I apologise to MS for the incident on behalf of RoD. <br>

It is suprising however, to see some of you blame the collective for one person's actions.  A guild is comprised of many different personalilites all struggling towards a common goal, it is impossible to know how each will react in any given circumstance.  How many flames are here against individuals ? how many of you blame their guilds ?  Again, we will try to correct the mistake...and move on.<br>

That's why Celdor is aiming accusations toward RoD.  Chie did what he did, and RoD neither took action against him nor made reparations toward Cyril or Affliction.  I wasn't there so I'm not going to comment on what exactly happened, but whatever happened it was the responsibility of RoD as a whole to deal with it. <p>Arikel Callistrae <BR>

The only person that mislead anyone from SF was Chiteng.  The misleading you mentioned was in-game, not the stuff on the message board.  None of them let you know that they trained an Affliction group, because that didn't happen from their perspective.  Your comments about the later action or inaction of RoD does not justify your misstatement about being mislead by the entire group regarding who had initiated the quest.<br>
<br>
As for my question about obtaining the bracer, neat sidestep.  I know the thing was originally destined for Cyril of Affliction.  My question, clearly, was whether you were the SF member to whom it was going to end up with if Chiteng hadn't spoken up.  Although I didn't re-read all 7 pages of that thread, it is my recollection that SF was planning to pass it out intra-guild if they couldn't figure out who had started the quest.  Again, were you the person it was going to end up with?<br>
<br>
Actually, the incident's that Chiteng has described seem a hell of a lot more serious than merely this bracer and necklace.  He was also the subject of the conduct, rather than some nebulous &quot;they.&quot;  Although I think he's a nut, I can at least understand why he's on his pogrom.  If none of these bad acts were directed at you, I don't understand yours.<br>
<br>
Your backpedalling is silly.  You said the whole guild mislead SF about who started the quest, when that was clearly not what transpired.<br>

I personally wouldnt of bumped up that thread, but i know why he did it. It doesnt matter if the guild condones these types of actions or not, if they dont investigate it and FIX the wrong that was caused, they are just as bad as the person who did it in the first place.<br>

Damn dude, don't jump all over me for something that I simply relayed.  People were upset .. all I was saying is that RoD (in their defense) had at least a solution in the works.  I wasn't rude to you .. I don't see where it's justified that you're rude back.  <br>
<br>
Point taken, however. <p>Tormentcia

And no I have a bene bracer and had one since way before this sad incident. Your quaint little jibe attempting to make me out to be someone who was concerned about the actual loot is sad and beneath anyone worthy of attention from an intelligent being. Like I said, syntax owns you. <br>
<br>
So, you want my final statement.<br>
<br>
If RoD knew about the incident that happened in the other post (which they did, after the fact. not considering the raid group was there on the spot, a RoD raid group.), then hell yes I hold the whole guild responsible. So do most other people.<br>
<br>
But then I read back a bit and I see that you have friends and such in RoD, which makes all this perfectly clear. I suggest you really reconsider your friends before you leap to defend them in a clear cut case of wrongdoing.<br>
<br>
I am through with you because you have yet to say anything except &quot;wah wahhh you lied you lied, cause....cause...you lied...wahh&quot;. If you think I lied, so be it. You can lead a dumbass to a clue, but you can't force him to understand it. I tried, I just don't have the patience to keep trying to get it into your thick skull. <br>
<br>
I am out, at least the GL of RoD is involved now and maybe something will get worked out. I still think Med should be looking for a new guild but I guess thats between MS and RoD.<br>
