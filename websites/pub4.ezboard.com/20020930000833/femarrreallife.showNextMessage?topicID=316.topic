<br>
- took her car and hid it. (she paid for the car, but it was bought when she had no credit, so it was put in her father's name)<br>
<br>
- took her cellphone from her. (physically, she didn't just hand it over.)<br>
<br>
- put her up in her old room at home, but took the keyboard, monitor and mouse away from the family computer so she has no contact with the &quot;outside&quot; world.<br>
<br>
she was on her way on foot to her boyfriend's home and they came and picked her up. (she only got into the car with them, because they told her, they would DRIVE her there [boyfriend lives 10 hours away]). they have yelled at her for four days straight now. she's so confused because her parents were always very respectful and treated her very well. she lived on her own since she was 18 (either in school or with roommates, but still supporting herself), so this is becoming a very big shocker.<br>
<br>
the thing is, is that she's basically being held against her own will. her mom/dad make sure she doesn't leave the house or make any phonecalls, etc. i've tried to get her a bus ticket to get the hell out of there, but the nearest bus station is 80 miles away. she lives in a VERY small (about 8,000 people) town and her dad knows most of the police squad personally. i've considered calling the STATE police (she lives in missouri) and have them check on her (i feel like her well being is being endangered), but i fear that it would just piss her parents off more, or they would just sent out the police from the town she lives in. is this even LEGAL? anybody know what legal precauctions that i would need to go through to just go pick her up in the middle of the night and take off? if she's willing to leave with me (she's 21, remember?), and take her across the stateline? i'm worried that i would be stopped and detained until her parents could get to her and take her back. <br>
<br>
this is all very disturbing and unreal. she's a very very respectful woman and doesn't seem to understand why her parents are doing this to her (other than CONTROL), so she's trying not to ruin her relationship with them both, but cut the noose around her neck at the same time.<br>
<br>
 i didn't know where else to turn, i've been trying to read on the internet about missouri laws, but its all greek to me. i called my state PA, but he was out of the office. /rude anybody else ever had this problem? ANY ANY ANY help would be great. <br>

<br>
However, unless her parents have some sort of legal guardianship/custody over her through the courts than they can't physically hold her there against her will since she is now an adult.  Often times if a person is found physically or mentally unable to care for themselves as an adult then they appoint a guardian for them (usually a family member if one is available).  So unless they have some sort of Court order granting them legal guardianship I would see no problem just going and getting her.<br>
<br>
Keep in mind tho, like I said, I'm not positive and this shouldn't be taken as any sort of legal advice.  Just my own opinion formed from the things I've learned and/or experienced.<br>
<br>
Damn, how bad is it that I've worked in a law office for so long that I put my own quasi-disclaimer in my posts?  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I will ask my boss tomorrow when he gets in the office and see what he has to say on the matter.<br>
<br>
Good luck to you and your friend!!!!<br>
<br>
<br>
P.S.  If she isn't allowed to contact anyone how did you find out about this?

<br>
she's not &quot;allowed&quot; to do this and that, but they have to sleep sometime and they aren't sleep with her. he brother found the computer and brought it to her and she emailed me. i bought a phonecard for her and she got to a payphone - only to be picked up again. i was there when she went to get her car and it was gone and i heard them yelling at her for six hours straight the first night was at her house. its all VERY insane. <br>
<br>
thankyou for asking your employer, my step-mom is calling her laywer in the morning (again out of the office, you'd think it was a weekend, not a monday &gt;:P). i'm sick of &quot;seeing&quot; her be tortured, which is what it is. <br>
<br>
for those who believe, pray for her - the lord will know who you're talking about. :&gt; <p><center>

<br>
She's 21 and physically able to take care of herself, then they have no right to hold her and it's wrongful imprisonment, and they can be put in jail for a long, long time.<br>
<br>
Her parents just flipped out one day... they weren't like this to begin with?<br>

What do they say to people who come to the door? (for her)<br>
What do they say to people on the phone?<br>
<br>
Have you considered calling the FBI? Because Wrongful Imprisonment and kidnapping are both felonies.<br>
<br>
I'd tell her (if you can) to sneak out on xxxx night when her parents are asleep, and meet her somewhere. With a car. Gassed up and ready to go across the country.<br>
<br>
If they really wanted to imprison her they're not doing a really good job of it if she's snuck out a few times.<br>

i've met them before, i've known her for years now, and they've never acted like this before. her parents are going through a divorce, her dad already has another girlfriend. i honestly believe that she's (the mother) is using her (the daughter) to get the dad back into the house. (he's there a LOT now, he moved out back in march and he's been there nearly everynight - thus making his new GF jealous/angry/etc.)<br>

nobody has come to the door for her YET. i live about 6 hours away from her myself, but when i call i'm told to stop calling/contacting etc etc etc. it just gets her into more trouble, so i've stopped calling her all together.<br>

i didn't even THINK of the FBI. i'm trying so hard not to get the law involved, but i think thats going to be the only choice i have. she says she's &quot;okay&quot; - she's a very strong willed woman, but i know this is taking a toll on her mind and emotions.<br>
<br>

<br>
see, i think they WANT her to sneak out (maybe the dad does? he seem to sometimes side with the mom and sometimes not? its very weird.) but honestly, i think they LIKE to keep her upset. thats so sick and twisted, but thats the only explaination that i have for it.<br>
<br>
i just feel so helpless, i can't do anything for her. she doesn't or anybody else for that matter deserve this. thankyou for the support, it means a lot.<br>

<br>
Be sure she takes all of her ID's and whatever money she has. She needs out, and if she's serious she'll listen.<br>
<br>
Tell her to go down to the county courthouse and change her name (last I checked it was like $90.00 to change you name) and (you sound like good friends so I'll throw this out there) help her get set up in a new place or at least offer her a place to crash until she can find a job etc.<br>
<br>
She doesn't need to be involved in whatever mess her parents have drug her into, and they had NO RIGHT to do so in the first place. Their problems are their own.. not hers.. and keeping her in the house against her wishes will only exascerbate&lt;sp?&gt; things. Keeping her there is not a solution by any means... but to her Mother.. it's probably her last chance and she is grasping at straws.<br>
<br>
I wish I knew this couple so I could go talk sense to them myself. Issues like this are no laughing matter, and they can be arrested for doing what they are doing.<br>
<br>
(If I seem to be over-reacting with the name thing then skip it.. I just threw it out there if she wants to totally break off contact with them.)<br>
<br>
Alot of this plan depends on her.... It sounds like she wants to leave but doesn't know how, or can't stand to leave things between her parents on a bad note. <br>
<br>
One thing she needs to realize.. BIGTIME.. is that those problems are not hers... she doesn't need to be dragged down by them or used as a pawn in a ploy for the wife to keep the husband.<br>
<br>

There is NO legality in what they are doing AT ALL. And, being that he is a lawyer he even added in that if she goes to the police and they refuse to help her and/or just return her to her parents then they are an accessory and can be sued as well hehe...<br>
<br>
There would be no legal reason why you couldn't just drive down there and get her.<br>
<br>
As far as the name change thing, it may be different in each state, but it's not nearly that easy here. You've gotta file the paper work, publish a notice in the paper, and then wait 20 days before filing the final set of papers with the court. And filing fees are gonna be different ALL over, but here it's like $136 for name change.<br>
<br>
Anyway, my own personal reccomendation would be to just go pick her up.<br>
<br>
Oh yeah, and I almost forgot. Even if the car is in her dad's name, if she can show that she made/makes all the payments on the car then she has an equittable interest in the car and has rights to it as well, regardless of whose name it's in.  <p><center><img src="http://www.geocities.com/kevinschic/Dhar3_frosty.txt"><br><a href="http://www.geocities.com/trueallegiance"><font face=verdana><b>True Allegiance</b></font></a></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ueloisathemage.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Eloisa the Mage</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 54<br> <font color=#E9D756>(6/21/02 9:20:15 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrreallife.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=324.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: hostage? legal? help!</span><hr size=1> thankyou again hon. i've sent her money for a bus ticket western union, if everything goes as planned (her dad is out of town and her mom is working at a crafts show [she's not making her go with her or the town will start to wonder why the hell her 21 year old daughter w/o a job is with her mom at a crafts show in the middle of the week - this town is nosey &gt;:P] so she's going to attempt to catch the bus [bus update, there IS a bus STOP in her town, she had no idea. what a dork] on monday and she should be at my house that evening. either way. she has the money now to get away - its just getting out of the house. thats the only thing thats keeping her. again, i appreciate the help here and the lack of flames. :&gt; now i'm off to clean! i havn't picked up in two weeks :/ the apartment is a wreck. &gt;: <p><center>

It's much more fun to have people show up at her door and take her parents "downtown", especially in this "nosey" town of hers. They do this to her, I think they deserve it, she's a legal adult. Plus you're making it out to seem that you're just going to take her away, and shrug off the situation, I sincerely hope you act against the parents in some way. <p>- u  r  sandwich</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uaoladariraveynfyre.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aoladari Raveynfyre</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 268<br> <font color=#E9D756>(6/24/02 3:29:51 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrreallife.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=324.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: hostage? legal? help!</span><hr size=1> Daur- the problem with that is the girls parents own -or are really good friends with - the local cops.<br>
