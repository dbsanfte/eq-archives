<blockquote><i><b>Chiteng</b> wrote:</i><hr>Ok if you actually want an answer to the question 'Have I ever contributed to the server' I suggest you go find Ogmuk and ask him. And no one else JUST him.<hr></blockquote>If it's something you contributed to the server, then why would Ogmuk be the only person to ask? &nbsp;No, don't tell me. &nbsp;Ogmuk, being of Da`Kor, is demon. &nbsp;You traded your first born child to him in exchange for him causing Ewle Ebonlore's banning... or something like that.<br>
<br>
<blockquote><i><b>Chiteng</b> wrote:</i><hr>If he isnt too busy counting his realm points.<hr></blockquote>Can you speak in sentences? &nbsp;Sheesh, for someone who kept going on about well-structured messages, you sure as hell like to kick decent structure out the door.<br>
<br>
<blockquote><i><b>Chiteng</b> wrote:</i><hr>I do not find it neccesary to trumpet petty accomplishments to the world.<hr></blockquote>You just find it necessary to trumpet petty dislike of a number of people to the world.<br>
<br>
<blockquote><i><b>Chiteng</b> wrote:</i><hr>All I see on this board is that the people posting (not even CLOSE to a majority<br>
of players) like Vendrix more than they like me. Ok I conceed out of that<br>
very small number (compared to overall number) yes indeed that is true.<br>
Would I generalize that to the rest of the population? No. I never will.<hr></blockquote>Consider the message board community a sample space of our server community. &nbsp;Hundreds of people post here, although some post less frequently than others. &nbsp;The general attitude toward you seems to be the same from those who bother speaking up. &nbsp;Do you really think that just because people don't post here that they'd agree with you? &nbsp;This also really isn't a popularity contest between you and Vendrix (which, by the way, you'd lose). &nbsp;You've attacked more than just Vendrix on more than just this message board.<br>
<br>
<blockquote><i><b>Chiteng</b> wrote:</i><hr>The majority do not really know either Vendrix OR me. I suspect they dont want to.<br>
Vendrix has the mystique, I say great let him have it. But if he has deluded himself<br>
into thinking he has an edge with the game designer just because he found<br>
a bug, I find that laughable. But it is a foolish man that lays all his cards on the table. If he insists on thinking that, then that probably weakens him.<hr></blockquote>I don't know about him thinking he has an edge with a game designer due to finding a bug, but he sure as hell has the gratitude of a lot of people for being a <i>very</i> vocal advocate of a server-side filter.<br>
<br>
<blockquote><i><b>Chiteng</b> wrote:</i><hr>You dont know anything about me either.<hr></blockquote>Wrong, I know that you are a pedantic fool whose idiocies are quickly filling up webspace. &nbsp;Your stuffy choice of words is annoying, your hanging sentences (someone teach this guy the usage of compound and complex sentences, please) get on people's nerves, and I'm sure that skull of yours would chip a diamond-tipped drill.<br>
<br>
<blockquote><i><b>Chiteng</b> wrote:</i><hr>That is one reason I dont reply to you.<hr></blockquote>Here's another: &nbsp;Like so many of the other people who have posted messages that involve actual thought processes, I'm "ignored" because you feel that acting as if I never posted will make the harsh reality of what I'm saying go away. &nbsp;The number of us saying you're an idiot should tell you something. &nbsp;Seeing as your "audience" has long gone (something you've already acknowledged), you really have no logical reason to sit around and defend and or attack anything, do you? &nbsp;This leads me to believe that you just enjoy starting trouble (sorry, but that doesn't automatically induct you into Da`Kor... at least as far as I know).<br>
<blockquote><i><b>Chiteng</b> wrote:</i><hr>You are simply another of many faceless detractors.<hr></blockquote><center><img src="http://inferno.wittsend.com/iceweaselx/sheik.jpg" hspace=10><br>
Not anymore. &nbsp;That's me in the middle with the blue headband. &nbsp;Ph34r m3.</center><br>
<br>
<blockquote><i><b>Chiteng</b> wrote:</i><hr>If you enjoy that role,<br>
hey its a free country. Since you dont actually know me, and I surely dont know you, your opinion is meaningless to me.<hr></blockquote>I doubt you know Vendrix, or the rest of Da`Kor, either. &nbsp;Hell, you mistook Nuldar for Kerrol. &nbsp;Way to go.<br>
<br>
<blockquote><i><b>Chiteng</b> wrote:</i><hr>The only reason I reply to you now,<br>
is that you took care to attract my attention. Fine you got it.<hr></blockquote>Maybe I got your attention, but apparently I failed to extract any reason from you.<br>
<br>
<blockquote><i><b>Chiteng</b> wrote:</i><hr>You see I DO have freinds within the mud. Most of the oldtimers left after<br>
they realized the way things were going around month five. They too<br>
felt I was wasting my time. Perhaps so.<hr></blockquote>Yay for you. &nbsp;You were around back when Erollisi Marr was 5 months old. &nbsp;What was that about trumpeting petty accomplishments? &nbsp;Even then they told you that you were wasting your time, eh? &nbsp;That attitude from other people still hasn't changed, and those aren't even the people posting on these boards here <i>now</i>. &nbsp;In other words, you've just admitted that even the people who aren't here posting against you think along the same lines. &nbsp;Congratulations.<br>
<blockquote><i><b>Chiteng</b> wrote:</i><hr>But it is my time to waste.<hr></blockquote>Yet it's also everyone else's time you're wasting, you evil, evil man <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/emoticons/laugh.gif">. &nbsp;(By the way, I'm enjoying this waste of time. &nbsp;It gives me something to do during the day when work gets slow.)<br>
<br>
<blockquote><i><b>Chiteng</b> wrote:</i><hr>My message as such was to Varixx and ONLY Varixx. I assure you he got the message.<hr></blockquote>Hey genius, coming to a community board to flame someone isn't going to get you a one-on-one discussion. &nbsp;Coming to a community <i>flame</i> board that used to be Vendrix's <i>guild's</i> message board is just going to get a lot of people jumping in. &nbsp;You're an idiot if you didn't know that. &nbsp;If you knew that, then you're a liar if you say that wasn't your intent.<br>
<br>
<blockquote><i><b>Chiteng</b> wrote:</i><hr>The rest of you are mere foils. If I were you, that would seem beneath<br>
me. But as you said, your having fun. Enjoy! You cant hurt my feelings,<br>
I would have to respect your opinion for that. Post all you like.<hr></blockquote>Hurting your feelings is hardly a goal. &nbsp;You apparently have none, as your obsessive habits have led you to ignore the advice of friends, shun common sense, and set forth on some sick personal war against people who you don't even know. &nbsp;You claim to not be affected by anything that goes on within these threads, and shrug off any facts that are brought up that contradict everything you've insisted upon. &nbsp;You're obsessed, yet so detached from reality that it's odd that you'd bring up feelings at all.<br>
<br>
<blockquote><i><b>Chiteng</b> wrote:</i><hr>To bad Tizzard is gone, you would have made a great tool.<hr></blockquote>Let's hear some more old-school name dropping. &nbsp;It makes you sound powerful and knowledgeable. &nbsp;By the way, I've got a guildmate with a planar cleric breastplate. &nbsp;Would you like to have that to fix the problems Da`Kor created in the past? &nbsp;Sheesh.<br>
<br>
<blockquote><i><b>Chiteng</b> wrote:</i><hr>I wont be posting in this thread again.<hr></blockquote>Oh hell, here comes a new topic already. &nbsp;Hey thread bumpers, have you been at it just to save your favorite threads from falling off page 20 due to Chiteng's New Topic spam? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uvanalyn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Vanalyn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 348<br> <font color=#E9D756>(10/29/01 12:41:36 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Really....</span><hr size=1> hahahaha yup new thread.... <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon2.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uogmuk.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ogmuk</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>ezOP</span><br>  Posts: 530<br> <font color=#E9D756>(10/29/01 9:33:46 pm)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.dakor.net/ogmuk/ppic2.jpg WIDTH=88 HEIGHT=108></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re:</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Ok if you actually want an answer to the question 'Have I ever contributed to the server' I suggest you go find Ogmuk and ask him.
