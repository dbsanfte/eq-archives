&quot;Um... what exactly offended you so much about Araya's post, Muzaak?&quot;<br>
<br>
I read Araya's post again and I misundertook &quot;minor amount of skill&quot; to be a snub. Sorry about that Araya. I think I see what you were trying to say.<br>
<br>
However, what got me irritated was the combanation of Jack Daniel's and Miller... err... I mean, what got me heated was what is implied by statements such as &quot;minor amount of skill to do X&quot;. Such generalizations are incorrect when applied to a whole such as the EQ gaming experience. I apologize for my earlier attacks, but a pet peave of mine is when others minimalize effort at something in general terms. Good for Araya and others who believe the game takes a &quot;minor amount of skill&quot; to play, but apply that to your own experience. Others who play this game may believe that it takes an incredible amount of skill and effort to play. While EQ is just a game, it must be remembered that many in the end game have put in many hours of effort to gain their levels and probably studied their class in depth in order to perfect playing strategy. When Muzaak becomes a Virtuoso I will come back and hypocritically say it was easy to do... a real no brainer! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/umuzaak.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Muzaak</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_lightning.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 53<br> <font color=#E9D756>(10/6/01 10:59:17 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I just want to try again, so eat shit!</span><hr size=1> Sheesh!

The thing is, you must maintain that minimal amount of skill all the time, with _no_ slipups.  The penalty for dying in this game is just too great to allow for frequent mistakes.  There are certain roles (pulling, for example) that have a greater allowance for excellence, but for the most part the rewards for excellent play versus merely competent play are pretty small and usually situational. <p>Arikel Callistrae <BR>

Tedious and OS, I can't imagine why you got that impression of me.  I can recall only 1 occurence in which I was doing exp in OS with a pickup group, about 3-4 months ago.

I've never heard of you, or half the people that posted in this thread, does that give me the power to deam their opinions false?  I'll assume you have a vast knowledge of the game that I do not possess.  Maybe in ST or some newbie zone I failed to visit there is an area to requires skills.  Maybe you can show me around a high level zone, show me some of that special skill of yours?<br>

<br>
Checked the next post and saw you gear, not too bad.  I'm played a monk, I quit my warrior about a month after Kunark, so I don't know exactly how good it is.  I'd say I had the monk equivalent of your gear at the minimum, some pieces above your gear.    If you want me to list my gear so you can compare I'll see if I can scrounge it up.<br>

<br>
I'm sorry I'm don't know what guild you are in, so I don't know what you plan/raid.  But I can bet that unless you found some new powerful zone in SoL you haven't done anything that would impress me.  Once again, I have not been to ST, so perhaps my whole view of the game would change after visiting that zone, however I doubt it.  As for working hard for my gear, yes I worked for my gear.  When I quit I think I had 3-4 pieces of gear that were droppable.  It's a shame my opinion annoyed you, unfortunately in life everyone does not agree with everyone else.<br>

Oh well.<br>
<br>
My main point is that killing 'high end encounter' type mobs DOES take some planning and skill on the part of leader and various other people.  Timing the CHeals correctly, standing in the right place, avoiding rampage, general position of players and mob, when to switch tanks, things like that.  They take skill.  I call it skill because i see a lot of people that CAN do it, and a lot of people that CAN'T do it.  I can't think of another word to describe that.  After practice, those that previously could not do it learn and improve until they can do it.  Therefore improving their SKILL.<br>
<br>
That's how EQ takes skill to play.  Pulling trash mobs in the various dungeons and killing them doesn't take much more than knowing your class.  Skill can come into this though, where one monk may perfectly split mobs almost every time and keep a constant flow at just the right pace for a non-stop xp group, and another monk may bring too many and wipeout or take so long to pull things the group gets bored.<br>
<br>
It's the disparity between good players and bad players that bring skill into the equation.  Good player has more skill than bad player.<br>
