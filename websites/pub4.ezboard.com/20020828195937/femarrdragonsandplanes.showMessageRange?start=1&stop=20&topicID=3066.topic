My mind is on the research paper I have to write for English Comp.  I love writing.  I enjoy the hell out of it.  What better place to browse for possible topics of interest than my local paper, right?<br><br>This was NOT a good idea.  It appears that Houston is gearing up for the trial of Andrea Yates.  For those not familiar with this name, I'll give you a brief summary.  <br><br>The 37 year old &quot;former nurse turned stay-at-home mom&quot; is accused of murdering her 5 children by drowning them in a bath tub.  She did this one at a time.  She then called the state police and told them what she had done.  <br><br>&quot;Defense attorneys say....innocent by reason if insanity&quot;  Based on the fact that her husband said she suffered depression after the youngest two were born.<br><br>The police arrived to find the 7 year old floating face up in a bathtub half full of water and the other 4 (youngest was 6 months) children's wet bodies on a bed covered with a sheet.  <br><br>She is facing only TWO capital murder charges in the June 20th deaths of three of her five children.  ALL 5 of them died.  <br><br>Here's where I go off.....Pardon my ignorance but WTF?? are these people thinking?  Hang this bitch in the middle of downtown Houston for all the world to see.  Are we to somehow believe that she was unable to distinguish right from wrong in the murder, one at a time, of her FIVE children?  After she was a NURSE??  <br><br>I'm in nursing school... We have to take several courses on ethics.  Not just ethics in the medical field, but we have to know right from wrong.  PERIOD.  She chose to stay at home with her children.  If you can't hack it, go VOLUNTEER somewhere.  <br><br>I do not care what the excuses are.  PMS, Post-partum depression...At 37 years old, having made it through nursing school and into the medical field...You KNOW the difference between right and wrong.  Don't give me this &quot;fit of rage&quot; bullshit.  A fit of rage is where you throw a piece of furniture, or even possible hit someone.  But a fit of rage ends well before you manage to hold down a child you gave birth to, in a bathtub full of water and drown them.  Do you think they didn't fight back???  <br><br>I have three kids.  They can drive me up a wall and back and make me want to build wall of velcro and put them in little velcro suits and leave them halfway up on the wall just to get some peace.  She should have fucking killed herself if she couldn't hack it.  <br><br>I couldn't hack staying at home.  I didn't want to kill my children, I was simply climbing the walls.  I volunteered, I eventually went back to work when my husband and I could work out a schedule where we didn't have to put them in day care.  <br><br>This woman needs to be tortured, tormented and repeatedly shown videos of her late family every waking moment for the rest of her life.  <br><br>And here I thought I was going to die of heartbreak when my dog disappeared 3 weeks ago.  Something happening to one of my kids???  Unthinkable!!!!  Completely inconcievable!!!  <br><br>/cries<br>/screams<br>/pulls her hair out<br><br> <p>Analorne Silversong <BR>51st Minstrel of Karana <BR>Officer - Vivix Protectorate</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uasotus007.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Asotus007</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 279<br> <font color=#E9D756>(2/18/02 11:15:54 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3066.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Public Hangings?</span><hr size=1> almost sounds like she is crazy huh ? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uanalornesongheart.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Analorne Songheart</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_lightning.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 243<br> <font color=#E9D756>(2/18/02 11:20:55 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3066.topic&index=2>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Public Hangings?</span><hr size=1> Nope, that's exactly my point.

Seriously,  if the U.S.A had stricter policies and stop being so scared of showing people what actually happens when you fuck up, I'm positive our crime rate would reduce.<br><br>As it stands, someone commits let's say murder, they go on trial, get sentenced to death by lethal injection (depending upon the state) and then eventually do get killed behind closed doors with no public eyes.  By public I mean a huge audience of more than 20 and possibly televised on T.V.  Where are our the people of our society going to &quot;learn&quot; that doing bad things has consequences?  They never actually see any of the consequences put into action!  The worst they would learn is that someone went to prison.  <br><br>Prison :: 1. a place of confinement especially for lawbreakers; specifically : an institution (as one under state jurisdiction) for confinement of persons convicted of serious crimes...<br><br><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Reality</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>Prison :: 1. A place of imprisonment for confinment of criminals where you are fed 3 square meals a day, have access to cable tv, ability to get a college degree, ability to work out in a gym, always have clean clothes, medical check-ups, dental and vision benefits, and last, but certainly not least, a warm bed to sleep in at night -- ALL FOR FREE.<br><br>Is it just me, or does prison not sound all the horrible?  Sure, I'm positive there are fights, gang rapes and all around hormonal people doing hormonal things -- But that happens in the outside world as well!  Where is the consequence of going to jail for your actions?!  There are none.<br><br>Yes, I also believe we should bring back public canings.  You see how well it works in Singapore. Their crime rate is tremendously lower than ours....<br><br>Until the U.S.A stops worrying about a law-breaker's human &quot;rights&quot; and actually starts treating criminals like criminals on a regular basis without hiding everything behind closed doors, our society as a whole will never get any better and the crime rate will never drop.<br><br>What the fuck is wrong with you people!<br><br>/sigh<br><br>I feel a little better and I certainly hope the post makes sense.

She is not crazy because her husband says she was depressed. She is obviously crazy because she killed her children. This is so against all parental instinct ( I have children too ) that I simply am at a loss to see how anyone could believe this gal is playin with a full deck. Now, I am not sure what is the best 'punishment' for her, but I hardly think hanging or any other death sentance would be. That would be the easy way out. We just had a case similar to this here in California where this guy went nutz and killed his wife and unborn child, his son, a young nephew and niece and an uncle. He was arrested finally but before his trial came up, guess what he did ? Yup, killed himself in his cell. You think he wanted to spend another 50 years mentally tortured during his more lucent moments about what he did ? Of course not, he took the cowards way out. I am always puzzled by the pro death penalty argument in this respect. Beside the fact that it's cheaper to incarcerate someone for life than execute them, beside the fact that it is not a deterrant to capital crimes ( as every study has bore out statistically ) I simply think it let's them off easy. If people really want 'societal revenge' for these sort of acts, which method truly metes this out better ? A pain-free execution that is over in minutes or a lifetime of remorse in confinement with full knowledge you will never see or do the things you enjoy in life ? To me it's a no brainer. <br><br>As to Diluted's post LOL, yeeeeeaahh, that BIG Catholic conspiracy in Texas. ahahahaha .... is little Timmy feelin persecuted cuz he likes to dress up lahk a vampire ! ooooooh, dude, go watch Buffy or something =P<br><br><br>Bibulus <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/usiilverain.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Siilverain</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>The Wind Caller</span><br>  Posts: 529<br> <font color=#E9D756>(2/18/02 11:52:22 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3066.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Public Hangings?</span><hr size=1> Excuse me Diluted...<br><br>Where do you find any information that the Catholic Church asked that this insane bitch of a mother be forgiven and have all the charges dropped because she was mentally unstable?

However, you have to figure in a lengthy appeals process, the actual cost of electrocution or lethal injection (more than you might think), the cost of putting up the convict while he/she is on death row, and in many cases the cost of a public defense lawyer, and you wind up paying a lot of money.

You can let someone out of jail and say &quot;sorry&quot; if the system screws up; it won't make it OK, but at least they can try and get on with their lives.
