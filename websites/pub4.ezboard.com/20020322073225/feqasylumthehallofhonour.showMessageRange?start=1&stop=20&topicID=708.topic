I had a list.<br><br>By the end.. There were so many names, I couldn't even begin to remember them all.<br><br>The ones I did get written down are as follows;<br><br>Kitiari, Netherbane, Jinjin, Ronaar, Zupa, Pimm, Skidtron, Dondos, Clowie, Jigu, Tsulyra, Zatan, Shadowdancer, Cicely, Taynea, Ryanilin, Bryne, Leolan, Tranthas, Muligan, Ldori, Motorman (and Istrahd), Naffiner, Suton, Gumman, Syanis, Raiin, Alphatema(sp?), Aidaes.<br><br>I'm sorry if I left anyone out from the first battle.<br><br>A very special mention to Dordain and Felishanna as well. You guys are the type of people that all Clerics should look up to as a role model. Thanks to you both, a lot.<br><br>Would also like to especially thank Seven Dreams. Sorry Xanth, I know you liked your evil and diabolical reputation.. But it had to be said. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>You guys came in, hell, I don't even know how you found out.. And very selflessly, cleaned up the place. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Thanks to every one of you who attended, and the rest of the guild should be proud to have you all as guildmates, officers, and their leader, Xantheus.<br><br>I know I missed replying to about 20000 tells throughout the evening, of sorry's, thanks, congratulations, and other assorted stuff.. Sorry that I couldn't reply. I was beyond stunned the whole time. Dordain had to remind me to breathe. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br>There is something I have missed somewhere that leads me to believe Shutter also had something to do with the amazing feat that was this evening.. Lemme talk to someone and find out exactly what that was, but I know you did do something, and I did get a tell from you, I remember that much, so thank you. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br>Now.. On to the story.<br><br>Ragefire.. The evil spawn of the Cleric epic quest. Spent about 40-50 hours since Tuesday with a monk logged in FD'd in the lair, watching for the bastich. Anyway.. Cleared FGs earlier today.. Nagafen sorta spawned on our heads. Thankfully we were all 53+, cept for my monkey, who suffered an atrocious fate. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  So, I found out who had Naggy booked, and came along on their raid.<br><br>Being 55, I could only offer buffs and help during the FGs that were up.. But I did, and by the hand of Clowie's sprinkler, my Monk got rezzed, and FD'd back into position. The camp begins, again, and I suit up for a 72 hour wait...<br><br>Went and watched TV, came back out to the computer to get a glass... And there's a human with a red robe and a stick standing in front of my monk.<br><br>As my heart leaped out of my chest, I sent a tell to a few RL friends in guild.. /q'd the monk, and relogged Darwinain, my cleric, who was camped at the zone.<br><br>My guild was in Temple of Veeshan for the most part at the time, and, I really didn't want to pull them out. So I called on a number of friendly people and guilds, and, before I knew it, half of Lanys was in SolB, cheering at me, and congratulating me on getting Zordak.<br><br>Pause here.. Special thanks to Second Covenant. You guys are seriously great. The first ones on the scene. I'm always here for you when you need me. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br>Anyway.. As the lair began to fill up with the aforementioned people.. I began to realize that there was -a lot- of people here.. Like lots more then it should take to kill Ragefire. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br>The wait was boring. People were slowly trickling in, rather then arriving in one group. Eventually, I got everyone up there and semi-grouped. Leolan found FGs repopping.. I knew that some were due to spawn soon, and said we'd have to wait for them to respawn and we could kill them.<br><br>We killed two or three, but with the raid getting anxious, and many people needing to leave, I had figured on the advice given that we could charm any FGs that added, and we'd be fine.<br><br>Giving a final shout to the zone to make sure everyone was ready, we were mostly gtg.. There were about 5 and a half groups of people there.. A couple had half mana or so.. But we had way more then we needed.<br><br>I didn't think about the strategy.. It's Zordak.. He's pretty tame. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br>Charmed Fire Giants do -not- stay charmed during AoE dispells, for the record.<br><br>Suffice to say.. The huge turnout turned into a huge pile of corpses.<br><br>Had him down to about 10% with 2 or 3 FGs beating on people in the background, I believe.. I wasn't alive to the very end to see.. But I was bound at the zone in, and I saw Zordak's shout of victory to the zone.<br><br>At this point, my head really began to spin, as I recieved too many tells to keep track of asking what happened, if we won, et cetera et cetera. I couldn't reply to most of them.. I was busy thinking how the hell I was gonna deal with 30 some corpses under a dragons feet that would despawn - thereby costing me most of the hardest parts of my epic - fairly soon.<br><br>The rest of the raid was a blur. Dordain heard wind of the trouble, as did Xantheus.. Soon enough, 2 or 3 groups of 7D were in zone. Gyn pulled out of ToV immediatley and flocked into SolB. Istrahd came with his necro and started summoning corpses like mad.<br><br>All the while, I sat in a daze, not knowing what to do.<br><br>Sagard and Jigu I believe were the ones who FD flip flopped around to keep Zordak agroed. Thanks guys. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Also had a few sacrificial lambs walk in to refresh his agro. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br>Finally get something resembling the exp group together.. When I hear that 7D moved up to Zordak.. Golliwog walks up, and tells the guild something like &quot;LOL, Zordak is dying rather quickly right now.&quot;<br><br>The rest of the raid runs up, and sure enough, Zordak goes down before I got up the stairs.<br><br>Talk about firepower. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br>He dropped a Red Scale (Grats Xkhanx), Gaunts of Fiery Might (Grats Naffiner) and a Treasure Hunters Satchel (Grats Sagard). And of course.. His heart, the very last piece needed to complete my epic quest. The quest for the Water Sprinkler of Nem A'nkh.<br><br>7D ran out without saying a word, among my praise and thanks shouts to the zone. People were sending me so many tells of grats, I think I got dizzy from my chat box scrolling up so fast. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br>You guys are all the greatest people a server could ask for. You all, every single one of you, are the reason I continue to play this game. Material goals, in this case my epic, are really secondary to the people you meet along the way, and the sacrifices that you see them make for you time and time again in game.<br><br>The only reason I ever wanted my epic, was cause it helps everyone else, be it on a raid for faster rezzes, or just because I don't have to make 1 more person suffer through that junky old 49 rez. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br>Thank you all, again. You all bring so much honor and pride to the server, I can't imagine a better bunch of people to share in the final memory of my epic. Everytime I rez someone, it's because of all of you, all the time you spent, and the things you've done. So next time I'm just sitting around and you get a rez.. Don't try and give me money (I don't accept payment anyway. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ) or thanks.. Just think to yourself what a wonderful server you play on, and thank everyone in the game.<br><br>I'll do the same for each and every one of you when you ask.<br><br>Thanks, Lanys.. Your help, as always, is very much appreciated. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br>As time allows, I will try and make a few more personal posts on individual guild boards.. But it's 4:45am here, and I gotta get to bed.<br><br>Yes, I have my epic.. And I got to test it out on a few people who had some mishaps in SolB before I logged. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br>Again, thanks for everything guys... I owe you all. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br>Dordain, Felishanna, Xantheus, thanks for helping me through the tough part.<br><br>Leolan, Istrahd, you two are there, as always, whenever I even think I might need you.. Thanks for the billionth time.<br><br>Thank you to everyone for the kind tells of congratulations. You all get free rezzes for life. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br>Night Lanys, catch you all tomorrow, and thanks for the Sprinkler. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br>Darwinain Seafarer<br>Gyn Cadley Reejeryn<br>Lanys T'Vyl<br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uvenen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Venen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I live here.... get out.</span><br> <font color=#000033>(8/10/01 12:56:23 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumthehallofhonour.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=708.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.blizzard.com/images/war3/units/lich02.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The majority of the Lanys server populice</span><hr size=1> Congrats man <p><center><br><br>Venen, Warlock of the<br> <br><img src= http://www.venen.homestead.com/files/ridaz.jpg></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/usqueekiepupie.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Squeekie Pupie</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>w4nn4b3!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(8/10/01 1:18:57 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumthehallofhonour.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=708.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The majority of the Lanys server populice</span><hr size=1> Grats Darwinain. <br>I am happy for you <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br> <p><div align="center"><img src="http://www.poljub.com/Images/super_symbol.gif"><BR> SupaSqueek Pupie <BR> Level 55 Defiler  of GCR  </p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uleolan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Leolan</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_bluespot.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle><FONT COLOR=AA0000><B>Lanys.com Moderator</B></FONT></span><br> <font color=#000033>(8/10/01 3:13:23 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumthehallofhonour.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=708.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The majority of the Lanys server populice</span><hr size=1> Make sure you swing that thing hard enough to knock some heads off for Xan <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p> - Leo<br> <a href="mailto:leolan@lanys.com">leolan@lanys.com</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/umyschiefmaker.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Myschief Maker</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>p0\/\/3r-p0sT3r!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(8/10/01 4:06:31 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumthehallofhonour.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=708.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> WOW!</span><hr size=1> CONGRATULATIONS Darwinian!
