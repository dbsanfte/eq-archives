However, in light of recent events and thoughts of my own and others, it seems more urgent to write a less thorough but more pertinent report on this condition.<br><br>Uberitis is an infectious disease among players of MMORPGs. Notably, EverQuest. It can often be encountered with cases of D00dness, although typically to a lesser degree. Symptoms include extensive play time in game and on message boards, a strong desire to make ingame money, and a sudden urge to no longer associate with others not affected by uberitis. Unlike d00dness, this disease can often be subtle, and one or more symptoms may not be readily apparent.<br><br>This disease is moderately contagious, and only to a select few. Uberitis will only spread to those constantly in contact with others with so called &quot;uber&quot; equipment. This is in fact the origin of the disease itself. However, it may lie dormant until later. When one suddenly reaches a sufficient level where he or she may be able to attain such items, the disease takes effect quickly and without restraint. In many cases, the drive to obtain &quot;uber&quot; gear becomes so strong that 20 hour play sessions become the norm. Such extreme cases are all too often seen recently.<br><br>There is no cure for uberitis. It would appear that when the afflicted has obtained uber gear, he or she will become docile again, no longer being aggressive towards others in his or her quest for equipment. My research on this phenomenon was concluded when I accessed message boards on items from Vex Thal. It seems that no matter how uber an item gets, uberitis affects the part of the brain which is satisfied, and thus makes the item seem unworthy of the effort needed to attain it. The best item in EverQuest simply *isn't good enough*. I stress this, because it leads into a dire and foreboding theory.<br><br>Eventually, the vast majority of players will be at the required level to catch uberitis. At this point you will simply have a majority of unsatisfied people. Those satisfied with the game will become outnumbered and leave. More people who aren't satisfied will leave too, as the game becomes less important. Left alone, this would simply continue until all the uberfied people leave, and new players eventually regain control. This will not remain unchecked. Verant will see the declining profitability of EverQuest. What happens from there is anyone's guess, but it would appear obvious.<br><br>And so my first Prophecy is born: Uberitis will cause the demise of EQ. Unless something more appealing is revealed in the future, it would appear that we may all be forcefully cured of our addiction.<br><br>*Note: Please be offended by my post. It was my intention.

Uber could be that fresh lamentation off Sebilite Guardian, or that fresh bloodfrenzy off Vhyzdra the Cursed.<br><br>Personally, I play EQ to hang out with my friends... and being lumped in categories like this just to me shows the ignorance of people who have never entered into this arena.<br><br>Actually, I used to spend 10+ hours a day in EQ roleplaying... but I won't say it went defunct, I just lost interest in what was left of it. So I figured 'hell, I might as level up to 60 and see if anyone could use me'. So, I threw out a few apps, and got a response from the newly reformed Magister. When I raided with them, I wasn't thinking 'lootlootlootloot', I was thinking this was pretty fun. Organized butt stompings, as opposed to the messes I had been in before.<br><br>If this conditioned really existed, Magister and Midnight Fury would still be raping NToV for the pretty much free loot that just drops in waves there.<br><br>Now if you want to whine, bitch, moan and judge, go ahead, this board caters specifically to those desires.

This, while an amateur attempt, falls into that category (I cannot compete with professionals). Still, the general tone exists. Glad that's out of the way.<br><br>I don't claim to have new ideas. I don't claim to see things in a new light. Look at my email address. Note the word Prophet. Maybe instead of immediately criticizing, you could attempt to appreciate. Or it that unknown to most of you as well?<br><br>How is this offensive? It is aimed at the uber people who complain about loot. My point is that they are ruining the game. I refer to uberness as a disease, after all. So, such uber people (should they find time to read my humble post), may take offense.<br><br>If you can honestly say you play the game simply for the friends and the fun, then you sir are a truly excellent person. And inferring that I play for the loot is uncalled for. Again, I'm satirizing that. I figured the little disclaimer at the top might clue some people in. At any rate, there is a serious issue at hand, one that needs to be considered. Stuff can only get so uber with the stat caps, haste caps, what have you. Then you have unsatisfied people. With a game as old as EQ, that's a lot of players. Should they decide to leave because the game holds nothing else uber for them, a large loss in customers could cause Verant to reconsider the game. You may say that they don't die, but how many of those were free service? Starseige: Tribes is still around, heck I even still play it. Not an MMORPG, but the simple fact of it being free helps that out. Starcraft, Diablo I and II, those are still around online. Again, free. You don't pay money to be let down. That's called stupidity. The price raise doesn't help either: you especially don't pay MORE to be disappointed.<br><br>So it was a rant after all. It was also one of my first attempts at a satirical post, but I either failed miserably or picked the wrong spot. I've been told it's funny, so I doubt it is the first case. It was also 4AM, if that means anything (and I *try* to keep a regular sleep schedule). If it helps that I had to explicate my own post, well there you go.
