What struck me as very moving was this was written by an 8th grader.  As I was reading I thought I was reading an essay written for a college class.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> This essay was originally a school assignment that I expanded. So far it has reached as for as the Washington Post and other local news-papers of the Maryland/DC area. I have to admit that it took about 3 hours of editing and I had to stop every 10-15 minutes so I could let out some tears. I hope you like my essay.<br>
<br>
How can people be this mad to do these attacks? A few days ago, a horrific act of terrorism struck the hearts of many American citizens. Two of some of the most respected and valuable buildings in the world were destroyed. The nerve center of the US Army and Navy were damaged. Although much lost, some good things can come from this disaster. The terrorists most likely wanted America to shut down airports, tighten security to create a fear of flying, cancel sports events and most of all a destroy the economy. Also, even if things such as the stock market closing, buildings collapsed, tens of thousands of jobs lost, one of the most favorite citiess in the US turned to a war zone, hope must not be given up. There are so many things that we can do to help get the United States back together.<br>
<br>
The first major task is that we all must come together and unite, which most of us are doing now. Before these attacks, there was so much violence, poverty, and crime in the US already. Now, we are coming forth as one country to show that we have freedom. Donations must be made to family’s that have lost loved ones and tributes to hospitals should occur. One thing the terrorists wanted was for the stock market/economy to go down. To backfire this plan, large money holders should buy huge amounts of stock to bring the economy back up. Not only will they be helping the country they will get all those stocks! Finally, memorials should be given and we can never forget the tragedy that has occurred. However, much worse things could happen from this that we can change.<br>
<br>
Personally, I think the terrorists wanted to change our lives and to put fear in us. The first thing we have to do is get back on the airplanes. Also, we must show that we can have good security and face our fears. We must help our neighbor, to recover from a loss and to encourage them to go back to work. A time of mourning is necessary, but a year of depression is not. America is a known for its freedom, which supposedly is lost. We must not lose our freedom. Although it was attacked, we must always defend it. Our flag still stands for freedom for they cannot take that away. Great leaps in friendship could occur sooner or later. We must show the world that we are not terrorized because we have heaven on our side. We will stand by as American’s.<br>
<br>
The last dreadful causes of these attacks are the retaliation efforts. I understand that we want to get rid of Osama Ben Laden, but we do not want to turn into the murderers that we have encountered. If we bomb, raid, or nuke any country, we will be killing many innocent people. We must not show that we are becoming evil, for that is what they wanted from us also. We must never fight fire with fire because two wrongs don’t make a right. We can learn by doing these actions, and find a legitimate way to deal with our problems.<br>
<br>
Why did these things happen we could never know? If it’s great buildings destroyed, lives lost, a damaged economy, or the tampering with our lives, we can never give up. Although good things can become of this, many sad events have occurred. The most important thing we can do right now is to become one and get through one of the most toughest things in American history. If we do accomplish this task, in 50 to 100 years we can pass along to our children and grand-children information about this past couple of days. Of how America came through this and can still remain a great nation.<br>

This is a very big issue when dealing with this essay and the movement that some Americans are saying... &quot;two wrongs don't make a right&quot;  This saying becomes invalid when applied to this situation because, thought war is wrong in essence, it has been the way of mankind since the dawn of civilization.  Going to war to defend ones homeland and/or beliefes has always been the way of the civilized world.  The innocent will die, true, but the benefits of a world free of the plague of terrorism far outweighs this.

Me? or the author?<br>
<br>
I do not assume this.  The author may assume this, but to assume what another assumes, lets not get into what assuming does.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> &quot;two wrongs don't make a right&quot; This saying becomes invalid when applied to this situation because, thought war is wrong in essence, it has been the way of mankind since the dawn of civilization.

<br>
First off, don;t call someone;s opinion invalid.  &quot;Two wrongs don;t make a right&quot; is an opinion, if you don;t hold this opinion that is fine, but don't say someone who holds this opinion in this situation is &quot;invalid&quot;, you just disagree, all opinions are VALID.<br>
<br>
WIthout getting into the semantics of &quot;war&quot;, realize not every war is fought with violence and hatred.  One great example is Ghandi.  Not that Ghandi's situation is how we should handle this, just pointing out that war does not equal murder.  I am sure we disagree on how this war should be fought. <br>
 <br>
So you assume that we have the power to eliminate all terrorism, only time will tell, I think you can see it is my opinion that we can reduce it but never eliminate it.<br>
<br>
You are welcome to justify killing innocent people, because you will save other innocent people.  That is your choice. <br>
<br>
Nice how people want to discount what an 8th grader writes because of his age, so much for &quot;The children are our future&quot;.<br>
<br>
They may not have all the answers, but ignoring their views is not fair either.<br>

Well, to tell you the truth, I put the quote from Alexander Hamilton in my original post in order to deter such a response from happening.  If you read the quote rhetorically it basically states that while statements are usually made in situations within reason, when they become proverbial and are used to explain situations which are outside that which they were originally meant for, they are invalid.  In this case, &quot;two wrongs don't make a right&quot; is a proverbial statement, not an opinion.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  So you assume that we have the power to eliminate all terrorism, only time will tell, I think you can see it is my opinion that we can reduce it but never eliminate it. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
No, but I do have the foresight to see that if something extreme is not done, this will happen again.  I bet my life on it.  This must not happen again.  Period.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  You are welcome to justify killing innocent people, because you will save other innocent people. That is your choice. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
You are only looking at the immediate situation.  Going to war with terrorism will not only save innocent people now, it will liberate the middle eastern countries from their idealistic dictators and thus they can begin to experience true freedom and, rather than despise it, understand all the goodness and values it holds.<br>
<br>
Finally, I address the point of the age of the author of this piece of work.  True it seems that this individual has only good intentions and patriotism, a sense of love in his heart for any living person.  All of this, however, is undermined by the apparent naivety of the author.  This person, although well meaning, is only a child.  A child cannot begin to comprehend the goings on of the political and social world.  A child cannot understand the magnitude of the situation we are now facing.  A child, this one not even born when Bin Laden and his terrorist orginization were beginning, cannot BEGIN to grasp and cope with the hatred and anger Bin Laden and his followers feel for the American people... for freedom.  This child, in his innocence, does not take into account the future, only the present.  Loss of life right now is high, it will continue to be high, but in the end when this horrible era is over, the lives saved and liberated will outweigh any actions taken now or in the near future. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uvakra.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Vakra</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 235<br> <font color=#E9D756>(9/15/01 2:27:53 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: An Essay of Hope and Justice to the American People</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Well, to tell you the truth, I put the quote from Alexander Hamilton in my original post in order to deter such a response from happening.

<br>
That was just awesome (even more so coming from an 8th grade student)<br>
<br>
I am going to cut / paste it and send it to a few of my reps that are feeling particularly down about the whole thing....naa...maybe I will just send it to my whole team!<br>
<br>
<br>
In any case, thank you VERY much for sharing that Vakra.<br>

<br>
Whether it is an opinion or not, the point is that many of the statements in the essay are posted in naivety.  This young man, it seems, is just as patriotic, upset, and afraid as the rest of us... but in reading the article, it is painfully obvious that he does not have the years and knowledge behind him to understand the magnitude of the situation.<br>
<br>
Peace.  What a concept.  We all want peace, it's true, but in this situation, there will be no peace.  It is rediculous to think terrorists or countries that harbor terrorists will put their hands up in surrender just for America saying &quot;we didn't like that.&quot;  Terrorists are irrational... it is impossible to bargain with someone who will give everything they have - including their life - to kill someone.  That is why action must be taken.  Use of force must be undergone, there is no other way.<br>
<br>
It pains me to say it but in this situation, a non-violent solution is only a hopeful dream for some.  It will not happen, because no more lives can be lost due to fanatical desires and power trips from some dirtbag hiding in a tent.<br>
<br>
God bless America. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uvakra.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Vakra</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 237<br> <font color=#E9D756>(9/15/01 6:27:16 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: An Essay of Hope and Justice to the American People</span><hr size=1> I guess you also feel the Pope does not have enough years under his belt to understand since he basically said the same things.  His statement is on this board, I cannot remember exactly which thread.  But I have a feeling you would not discredit him for being to naive and young.  Maybe you will find another way to discredit his saying not to resort to violence and hatred.<br>
<br>
But if you want to discredit someone's opinion based on age (another discriminitaion), then tell me who is older (and therefore wiser based on your own words), you or The Pope?<br>

I never once said I was wise, or that I was old.<br>
<br>
The fact of the matter is, the Pope is a religious leader.  It is his duty to instill hope in the hearts of his followers - in all the world.  The Pope spoke of peace, of love, but he knows that to get to this will require force.<br>
<br>
I am not arguing with the idea of peace.  I would love nothing more than for the terrorists of the world to come out, give up, and stop their evil ways.  The reality of the matter is, though, that this will not happen.  Something must be done to ensure that this never happens again.  Human life is a prescious thing, and hatred does nothing but fuel the fires of the terrorist groups.  There is no way to bargain.  There is no way to convert them.  There is no way to work out a deal.  When a person has been alive as long as his Holiness has, he knows the ways of the world.  He knows what will happen, and he mourns it, but I am sure he also knows it is necessary to ensure the safety and freedom of the people of the world.<br>
<br>
These terrorists must be eradicated, for the good of people everywhere.  Peace and freedom are not free... they are paid for in blood.  Sad though it is, it is true.<br>
<br>
God bless America <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uvakra.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Vakra</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 241<br> <font color=#E9D756>(9/15/01 10:07:54 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: An Essay of Hope and Justice to the American People</span><hr size=1> So now age doesn't matter?<br>
<br>
So now because the Pope is older he MUST agree with your view?<br>
<br>
I hope you are not serious.  The Pope has NEVER spoke out for violence, hate nor blood.  Do not put your own opinions into his statement, read his words, and his words only.<br>
<br>
I have quoted to prove my point:<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> I add my voice to all the voices raised in these hours to express indignant condemnation, and I strongly reiterate that the ways of violence will never lead to genuine solutions to humanity's problems.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Even if the forces of darkness appear to prevail, those who believe in God know that evil and death do not have the final say. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Let us beg the Lord that the spiral of hatred and violence will not prevail. May the Blessed Virgin, Mother of Mercy, fill the hearts of all with wise thoughts and peaceful intentions.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Let us not assume that the Pope says one thing while he believes something else, until you can prove he believes in something else.  <br>
<br>
No mention of force or blood there, nor violence or hate.<br>
He is speaking AGAINST violence and hate.  Feel free to disagree with him, but do not assume he does not truly believe what he says.<br>
<br>
Its very ironic how the eigth grader's opinion is disregarded because of his age/naivity, and the Pope's statement gets new meanings added because he is old and wise.<br>
<br>
Do you really think because you read 100 people who come here to say violence is the answer that anyone esle in this world over a certain age AUTOMATICALLY agree because they are old and wise and everyone under a certain age does not know better because they are young and naive?<br>
<br>
I truly hope not, and would hope you would take a person;s word rather than discrediting it based on age or assuming they meant something else based on age.  I bet if an eigth grader wrote about how he wants to see boodshed and revenge, he would not be called naive.<br>
<br>
Sad state of affairs.  I am done with this thread.  Every time I read this message board I am reminded how the terrorists have already won.  Go and kill them all, every terrorist in the world, kill them ded.  They still won.<br>
