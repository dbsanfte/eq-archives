Its a sad fact of life, but I look for acts of kindness in my life, and not the paper (I read that for current events, although lord knows it'd be nice sometimes to see a little more uplifting things in the paper). As for children and notions of right and wrong... Just because its undeveloped doesn't mean its not there.  There is something not right going on in the minds of someone who would set *anything* alive on fire.  Its basic: Causing pain is bad for me, so others won't like it either.  My little brother could not watch &quot;Milo and Otis&quot; when he was younger because so much of the movie was a kitten and puppy in danger, and he was younger than the youths Kulani mentioned. <p>Malevant Faeshadow<br>

I was raised hunting from and early age (shot my first firearm when I was 4 years old) I began to hunt when I was about 8 years old. There are many valid reasons to hunt. Population control of animals in general (since we seem to have killed off or driven away a lot of the natural predators), to protect ones livestock/crops, and quite frankly as a tradition of learning one's woodslore, etc. <p><img src=http://eshamlin.home.mindspring.com/lith.jpg></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/udrywit.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Drywit</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 43<br> <font color=#E9D756>(10/25/01 7:37:42 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://home.pacbell.net/magpie13/morepix/phantom3.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: What the fuck is this world coming to (OT, non EQ)</span><hr size=1> Remember,<br>

These kids are living in a world where it's OK to use products that were tested on animals in much more painful ways than being burned alive.<br>
<br>
People eat meat that comes from 'factory farms' in which it is less than pleasant to be born and raised.<br>
<br>
Humans wear clothing made from the fur similarly tortured animals.<br>

Until all this disregard for animal life is stopped, things like this will be daily occurences.<br>

A) I said &quot;just about&quot; the sickest thing. It still is &quot;just about&quot; the sickest thing. Not the sickest... but up there in the top 10.<br>
<br>
B) Second, I admitted in the second post on the topic that I don't get out much or watch the news.<br>
<br>
C) Third, sept. 11th wasn't even CLOSE to happening when I posted that... I wrote the first post on June 6th, and someone chose to bump it last week.<br>
<br>
I won't even dignify the PETA persons response, seeing as I abhor PETA and all it stands for. Even when they DO accidentally do something good, it's only to further thier agenda of no animals in captivity for any reason (re: no farm animals, no zoo animals, NO PETS... we all end up being depressed vegetarians who don't even know what an animal looks like, and I won't even go into the effects on the animals themselves). Damn, I dignified it with a response. <p><center><A HREF="http://home.earthlink.net/~roseydawn" TARGET="_top">

<br>
I live in a two of about 6 thousand people.  We have the third higest drug making/growing per capita number in the US.  We also have the 4thish highest teen suicide rate per capita in the US.  In the past year, there have been five different gun incidents at school, two of which shots were fired.  One man tried to slit the throats of every elementary aged child because he was saving them from God or some such worthless crap.  Four seventh grade girls were arrested for calling in a bomb threat to my school back in the day, no harm done, right?<br>
<br>
Three words:<br>
Kill the Fuckwads<br>
<br>
Friend of mine was on a Grand Jurry (sp) for a few months, half the cases had to do with child abuse.  The worst was a mother who starved her son, and made him sniff some sort of mixture that made blood run out of his ears as he lay twitching on the floor.  This continued for many months.<br>
<br>
Three words:<br>
Kill the Fuckwads<br>
<br>
Sometimes, a human life is worth snuffing out for the betterment of us humanity, they gave up their right to live through the choices they made.  I only wish the death penelty was applied more effectivley.<br>
<br>
dont give me the &quot;the death penelty kills some innocent people, what about them?&quot; bullshit, I will personally volunteer to be that one person who gets killed innocently for all the Fuckwads to die, would you?  dont give me the &quot;his parents abused&quot; him bullshit, its called counciling.  dont give me the &quot;he deserved to live&quot; bullshit either, because he doesn't.  dont give me the &quot;its not worth taking another life over&quot; bullshit, because ask yourself, does a man who first rapes, then kills, dozens of underage boys and girls, is in a courtroom pleading not guilty, does that man really deserve to live?<br>

PETA as an organization takes things too far to an extreme, to a point where human lives and livelyhood are at stake. Humans have relied on aninmals for food, clothing, etc. for a VERY long time and I don't see it changing any time in the near future. The only difference now is that we are more effecient in raising/slaughtering livestock and better able to manage wildlife.  Remember, livestock is just that, livestock, a means for some to make a living and a source of nourishment/clothing for many. Is hunting cruel? Nope. A rifle shot is far more humane than letting an animal population overpopulate and either A)Run in front of car or truck and get splattered or B) starve. <br>
<br>
Bottom line if such organizations/people would tone down thier stance just a bit I truly think they would get more attention. For the most part I think the general population thinks them as nothing more than crackpots and ignores them or ridicules them. Extremes cause people discomfort, tone it down fellas, you might actually get someone to take you seriously.  <p><img src=http://eshamlin.home.mindspring.com/lith.jpg></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ukenidianpistachio.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kenidian Pistachio</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 6<br> <font color=#E9D756>(10/26/01 7:12:39 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: PETA and those who think/post along those lines..</span><hr size=1> I am not a member of PETA.
