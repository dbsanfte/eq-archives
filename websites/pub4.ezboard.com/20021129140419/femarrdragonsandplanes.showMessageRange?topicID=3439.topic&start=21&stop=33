<br>
It's good to see you back after your transition from the island to the mainland. I finally got my shammy epic to, btw.<br>
<br>
Concerning San Angelo and Texas, just give it a chance. I'm fifth generation Texan. My family settled after the Civil War not too far from San Angelo. I spent my early years there. I too went to Goodfellow back in '87 to attend the Target Intelligence school (back when the Air Force still had Target Intelligence Officers). Goodfellow is a good base, San Angelo a good town. Big city it is not, but the people there are solid, genuine, and helpful.<br>
<br>
I recently set up Cox cable access for my mom in Fort Worth. It is cheap, only costing $25 per month when you already have cable TV. I set up a Motorola router and a Linksys hub and the connection works great. Of course Fort Worth is a bit bigger than San Angelo and like any connection, regardless of geography, "your mileage may vary." When I was visiting mom and of course logging into EQ, the connection remained solid - more solid than my Earthlink DSL in Chicagoland where I currently live. I'm sorry you got a Jetro version of a tech repair person, but don't let the Texas twang and one syllable words mislead you, they aren't normally as stupid as they might sound to someone not used to the ACKsent. I have come across plenty of stupid techs in Chicago, Denver, Las Vegas, Sacramento - places where I've lived in the past. So stupid techs are a natural part of the business regardless of where you live, due to what they pay these poor people. They run the Cat 5 Ethernet wire through copper pipe? I'm impressed. When ever I pull cable I never use expensive stuff like that - bare wire bundled by plastic ties and metal hooks, that's the way I install building wire.<br>
<br>
You got stuck in a Spanish only call in channel? That's the first time I've ever heard that happen. Usually you will first have the option to hear the call in English (press 1) or in Spanish (press 2). After that choice you then get to choose the other myriad of choices to route you to the right person. The fact that you got a tech to visit must mean that you overcame the language barrier somehow.<br>
<br>
One last note. Be very careful insulting Texas and Texans, especially if you live there. Texans are extremely proud of their state and heritage, even more so than a typical American is proud of being American. It is not unheard of for dissenters to be "dealt with" in the usual Texas way. I've lived all over the US and the world during the years I was in the Air Force. I think that description can be applied to many areas. The majority of ones complaint about an area is directly influenced by one's perceptions upon entering the area. I realize Hawaii is heaven on earth, with beautiful weather, lush green tropics, breath taking views of ocean, sky, and earth. To be uprooted from that visual scene to now be in brownish, dry, West Texas is a major change. But try to get out and meet the people. Take a walk in the parks downtown. Get out and see land that is little different from what it has been like for thousands of years. You are five hours drive from Fort Worth and Dallas. Take a weekend trip up and see an amazing area. Fort Worth has transformed from a dying downtown to a thriving downtown. Dallas is, well, Dallas is Dallas. Take a weekend trip over to San Antonio too, one of the most beautiful downtowns in America, particularly along the riverwalk. Oh God, I'm beginning to sound like some travel brochure. Well, I'll stop and just say, "get out and see places and meet people." By the end of July I plan on moving back to Texas after being gone for many years, and I probably won't move my home out of the state again. Looks like I am heading to Houston, so once I get settled, you are welcome to come visit and I'll show you the sights.<br>
<br>
Darn, I wasn't nasty and rude and here I am in the Rants and Flames section. OK, just to get into the flavor of posting in this unclean section again, let me briefly get into the mood of being rude and nasty. YOU SUCK! OK, that should do it for now. Time for me to get back to the decent parts of the forum, wash my hands after touching the keyboard in this section.<br>
<br>
Ya'll coom back now, ya hear?<br>

Grats on the epic too.  I got mine as well just recently so you, me and frekkels in about 2 weeks time thats a lot of completed epics.<br>
<br>
Saw you yesterday in freeport with my pally helping another shaman with the first epic part.<br>
<br>
BTW I make fun of texas just out of competition.  When I grew up one of my best friends moved near me from texas.  And when the Bills lost soi many times to Dalls in the superbowls and the sabres to the stars in the Cup finals thats when I really started to hate texas lol.<br>
<br>
Anywy update on it another cable guy came out and he seemed more knowledgable.  He didnt give me any baby like analogies.<br>
<br>
He explained that they think there is a &quot;noise&quot;  somewhere along the lines between the base and the station.<br>
<br>
He said this means that somewhere the wire if exposed and any kind of noise (ie lawnmower) can interfere with out service causing the sparetec cutoffs.<br>
<br>
I think I believe this guy as they came out Saturday to work and now my service seems a better.<br>
<br>
Thanks for all the suggestions.<br>

<br>
You don't have a router friend, so don't worry about those issues for you, unless you decide to put a second computer online.<br>
<br>
The NOISE problem though, is a valid cause for disconnects.<br>
My DSL line would occassionally do this, and I finally had SNET come out to check the line for the cost of a service call.<br>
(~50-60 bucks)  When his inspection was done, he said the background noise level on my line was about ten times what it should have been.  <br>
<br>
Further investigation revealed a blown capacitor on the box outside my house.  The cap. is part of the filter network to reduce the background noise.  He fixed it, and I didn't even have to pay for the call to the house since it was determined to be an &quot;exterior&quot; problem. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Woot!<br>
<br>
When everything was done, my noise level was much lower, and a phone rep was actually able to DOUBLE my available speed since I wasn't using all the bandwidth available.  <br>
<br>
Solved my connectivity problems (separate from the router fiasco, but that was a software issue that doesn't pertain to you).<br>

Go figure...<br>
<br>
I live in Abilene, about an hour and a half north of you. The service is no better here. I've been back here for less than three weeks now and I've already had Cox on-site 6 times, and have logged about 20 hours on the phone with them. Their service stinks, and will continue to stink for a long time, I'm afraid. I had AT&amp;T cable in Dallas, which was 100% better.<br>
<br>
DSL is the ideal solution for the lot of us, I believe. I intend to order it here pretty soon myself. I'm damn tired of having to kick in my backup 56k link.<br>
<br>
And now, on to the small stuff:<br>
<br>
1. Careful what you say about Texas. We've got you surrounded.<br>
<br>
2. Spanish is EXTREMELY prominent in this state. Sometimes it bleeds over and English-speaking people get Spanish lines. My suggestion would be to learn Spanish.<br>
<br>
3. The water in San Angelo just plain sucks. I spent a year or so there some while back, and learned the hard way. That's what you get for being that close to Lake Nasworthy though. Rather than throwing money at machines, get a Brita pitcher. They're available cheap at Target.<br>
<br>
4. The service techs for Cox are, at best, complete retards. So long as you're getting a signal, they call it a job well done. These people can't understand the need for a persistent signal to save their lives. It's fun to call them and make them climb around on the roof to look for corroded connectors though.<br>
<br>
And that's all I have to say about that. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uhawaiihouse.showPublicProfile?language=EN>hawaiihouse</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 551<br> <font color=#E9D756>(7/3/02 3:42:06 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3439.topic&index=30>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Texas rocks</span><hr size=1> LMFAO.<br>

I am not surrounded, Its just I can attack from all sides <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
The whole base internet service went down last night and it took 43 minutes for myself and my next door neighbor to get a tech on the phone.<br>
<br>
Again there is no option for english or spanish it starts off english then turns into spanish with spanish elevator music.<br>
<br>
But luckily my Buffalo ass is only here for 3 more months.  First 2 months where free and now since I complained I have gotten another free month and I will keep complaining.<br>
<br>
If they cannot get there heads out of there arses then I will have 6 months of internet free.<br>
<br>
As for the DSL being here for only another 3 months I have to have  a Verizon number for 4 days to even qualify.  Then they have to test to see if I can even have DSL.  Then I have to make a appt for them to come out which is another 2 weeks.<br>
<br>
On top of that the basic phone service is $29 and on top of that DSL, the basic package, is $39.99 so that ouls be about $70 a month if I even qualify for DSL.<br>

Cox here in New Orleans is absolutley amazing.  I have had cable outage 3 times in the last year and half since i signed up, of which 2 of those lasted maybe 15 minutes and the other was when the whole @home transfer happened.   I've forgotten what LD means its been so long since it has happened to me.  <br>
<br>
Yes, Cox is a huge company, and the cable industry in general is a monopoly....you pretty much are stuck with whatever company has the rights to your area.  I have nothing but high marks for Cox here, however....from customer service, to keeping us connected throughout the messy @home break-up.<br>
<br>
That's right, I'm not afraid to say it!  I love Cox!  I guess that means I have something in common with Shardon afterall... <p><A HREF="http://www.midnightfury.org/character.php?char=sarsippius">Sarsippius Smith</a><BR>

<br>
Try less than, yes TAKE OUT memory until you have only 512 MB RAM.  THEN try EQ again.<br>
<br>
While this may seem odd, I and a friend of mine would go LD after only playing for a few minutes, the only thing that we had changed on our computers at the time was the amount of RAM.  went from 512 to 756 when luclin came out.  After troubleshooting and replacing the RAM a total of 5 times, left some out and haven't had a problem since.<br>
<br>
Trying the new LAN card is a viable option as well.  If you can post some ping times and possibly a tracert or two to different ip addresses that might help too.<br>
<br>
<br>
On a side note, take your Buffalo ass back up to Buffalo as far as I am concerned.  Not every person in Texas is a @#%$ moron, and I am almost positive that up in Buffalo you have some idiots that would possibly rival the Jethros here.  So either get the hell off your high horse or go the @#%$ home.  If there were only Texans in Texas we wouldn't have to deal with traffic, terrible drivers, rude ass yankees, and stupid whiny fucks about the heat.<br>
<br>
Just my 2 cents. <p><center><img src="http://www.rescomm.net/EQImages/tallsig.JPG"><br>
