<br>
I have a friend who has been treated very fairly, invited to raids, and generally been allowed to see a lot of neat things that she may never have seen in her eq career, by one of our larger and/or influential guilds.<br>
<br>
Now I'd rather not name who that person is, because already those of her friends who know that she has been raiding with them, and think she may be joining their guild, have been, at least in my opinion, fairly rude about it.  I'd hate to have more people find out about it and add to the fire.<br>
<br>
So, I'm curious, what could drive someone to ridicule someone they once called a friend for wanting to have more fun than her guild and/or circle of friends can offer?  Personally, I'm not looking to join any 'uber' guilds, but if I did want to, I would think, or hope at least, that even though my friends are dissapointed I won't be in their guild or whatnot, that they'd be happy for me in whatever decisions I make.<br>
<br>
What if I want to see Veeshans Peak?  Sleepers Tomb?  Or any number of zones out there ... if I want to do that, I need to take steps to get there, no?  So why ridicule someone for doing what it takes to increase their enjoyment in a game.<br>
<br>
Calling someone a sellout, and any number of varied terms that I've heard used against those who leave a guild to join a larger and/or more powerful guild, is kinda ... well, not cool.  Personally I don't like the idea of guild hopping for items, that I can agree with.  But even that doesn't deserve ridicule.<br>
<br>
It all comes down to this.  Are you their friend?  Because friends don't ridicule eachother.  Teasing is one thing, I do my fair share, and then some of that.<br>

I have seen people jump around just to get something from a guild, but if you have an opportunity to join beacuse you are going to get more of what you want from the game then go for it. There is a friend of mine who has the chance to join a &quot;uber&quot; guild and if she decides too there will be no hard feelings. Of course I am gonna tease her but would not hold a grudge. LOL<br>
<br>
It maybe the case that the people you refer to are just plain jealous. In which case they will either deal with it and continue being friends or stop being friends which would be no big loss.  IMHO<br>
<br>
No matter what is said or done the bottom line here is you should find the guild home that fits what you want from the game wiether it be a built in chat channel, Uber guild or little of both. I have RL friends in game who don't play on my schedule, not gonna hold it against them if they join someone else who will help them get all they can out of this game.<br>
<br>
Guess it is true you find out who your real friends are, I have been lucky enough to find some very good ones in this game. Some of which I have even met IRL.<br>
<br>
So to her/him  I say go for it, join up see things you couldn't before , and if they don't like it give them some cheese to go with their wine.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

They're more like &quot;online friends&quot; than real friends. I'm sure real true friendship can grow from playing EQ together alot, but its not the same kind of relationship you have with your best friend that lives down the street kind thing.<br>

If I want to join their guild at some point, and they use my criticism of them as a reason for not allowing me in the guild, then it's obviously not the guild for me.  They are too insecure about their problems to want to do anything about them, so instead they push away the one who pointed out their faults.<br>
<br>
As for the friendship thing, the same could be said of a lot of things.  Personally I have only about 3-4 friends IRL, and I'm happy with that.  However, if I suddenly lost an interest in computers, we'd have a lot less in common.  Friends are brought together by common factors.  Things that they like in the other person, which in most cases is an interest that they  both share, be it sports, computers, paintball, arguing, whatever.<br>
<br>
Maybe I'm just one of the unlucky (and cynical) few in the world who've never had a friend that was just a friend in spite of the fact we had almost nothing in common, who was my friend no matter what.  Or perhaps I'm right, and that doesn't exist.<br>

I mean, if you don't have something to spend the time with, how do you maintain a friendship? <br>
<br>
However, a friendship can evolve beyond that, if that bond is broken, through certain means. This bond will normally get filled up with another bond, as people like to share common interests, but I have a couple people who I would do a lot for, and I consider vice versa that I've met online, and know only through online. I rarely play anymore, so I doubt that would be the driving unit. It's more that we share a common personality, and enjoy our company. *shrug*<br>

I know it was hard for me when people left my old guild to join uber guilds.  You try so hard to build the guild and start making progress and then key people leave for &quot;bigger and better things&quot;... it doesnt make it right at all though and any &quot;grind&quot; i might have put someone through, unintentionally, was flat wrong of me... and of anyone who does that.  <br>
<br>
I know i am not like that, but toward the end of my time in EQ the &quot;corruption&quot; of greed that pervades the game got to me.   There is something about EQ that breeds attitudes for some reason.  I salute those who dont let it get to them and play as good, warm intentioned people.<br>
<br>
to echo what Kinzix said... that is so so so true.  Some of the people i thought were my best friends just disappeared after they or I quit EQ.  Several people i have sent emails too to get a rather brief responce (which i responded to) if one at all.  <br>
/me glad been emailing wif kinzy lately <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I am continually amazed at the way people are in EQ.  How easily friends turn their back on friends.  Friends whom you gave everything to because you believed in them.  Some times its something as simple as a disagreement about the way things were handled in the guild that does it, sometimes it is worse... loss of a freind over an EQ item is sickening.<br>
<br>
Then there is the &quot;out of sight, out of mind&quot; thing... which sadly is VERY dominant in the online community, especially EQ.  The phraze &quot;wait till you quit EQ to see who your friends are&quot; is SOOOOOOOOOOO true.<br>
<br>
I have to say how proud i am of the OoA (Order of Ascension).  That is one guild that sticks together.  Its amazing how many members talk to each other all the time who dont even play EQ or a game at all.  They developed friendships in EQ and stuck together as friends despite the game.  Certainly, that is not EVERY member... but a damn lot.  Heck, there are people chatting in the OoA that i have never even met in any game <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
I still keep in contact with many of my old CO guildies though. It's pretty nice considering the guild was disbanded and a nice chunk of players are no longer playing EQ.<br>
<br>
Of course, ICQ makes doing so a hell of a lot easier. <p><left>

Some guilds are used as stepping stones for uber guilds. I seem to be part of one myself. I see many good friends leave to go onto larger guilds. They send tell for a few weeks, and then you never see them again. Then I see many younger players join because we are doing things that are Uber. Then once they pass you in lvls, they are out as well. You still have your core friends though. The ones that are bound by rl friendships.<br>
<br>
Its all a question of patience. It takes time to build uber guilds, and the server can only support a limited number of them. Mainly because people quit and retire/twink and the numbers need replaced. People are singled out and given attention. And of course they are gonna leave. P4at L3wts baby. <br>
<br>
It is hard to find truely loyal people to play with. Everyone here is semi-selfish, we play a game that requires hour and hours of time; many times ruining marriages, friendships, or other thing in rl. So what is the answer? I gots no ideas. But if somebody knows how to keep friends and lovers, please write a book. I will buy it. Is it wrong for people to join uber guilds? Can you stop em? Do you want to? They were probably gone before they left anyways.<br>

Interesting post, but the quick and dirty of what I wanted was, if you really feel that they are your friend, why not just be happy for them?<br>
<br>
In the case of my friend, it's just a *little* bit too late for that.  If I was treated the way she has been by her 'friends', even if they did ask me to join them on raids, I wouldn't feel comfortable doing it; mostly because I would feel uncomfortable around anyone who called themself my friend, then treated me as she was treated.  So far I've not heard of her being given anything except friendship and fun from this other guild.  Sounds to me like, along with being able to go do some neat things she'd never done before, nor would have a chance to do, that friendship was very important to her.<br>
<br>
Not to mention the fact that I know of at least a few incidents where her own guild members were causing strife that upset her to the point of wanting to quit the game.<br>

<br>
Also, in my experience, you can't just &quot;jump&quot; into a strong guild and get PH@T L33t.  The stronger guilds have probationary periods where no looting is allowed to evaluate people for just this type of thing.  If you were a smart cookie you might realize that a person could learn worthwhile things from ridealongs with more experienced guilds and bring that knowledge home with them to improve their own guild...<br>
