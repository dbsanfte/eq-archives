<br>
i have edited the post by Vindication containing very personal and private correspondance between two people who were under the illusion of confidence.<br>
<br>
i will now explain why.<br>
<br>
i got an e-mail from nomaru (vindication) this morning with those very logs, which to him, prove that Nand 'loves' him. he asked me to swear not mentioning them, not to tell anyone about these logs, not to post them; he gave them to me just to explain his side.<br>
<br>
not more than 3 hours later, i see those very logs posted by himself. i'm putting a halt to this.<br>
<br>
here by decree of Xian the Tyrant (C)Arios2001:<br>
<br>
#1 - under no circumstances are logs and screenshots of a personal nature that were given under the illusion of confidence and trust to be posted on this messageboard. This board is not to promote or to antagonize the already soap-oprea-y nature of these threads.<br>
<br>
#2 - anyone violating this order on this thread or others on this topic involving these people will be banned from the messageboards PERMANENTLY. (more importantly, if you want to know if something is appropriate... ask me, ok?)<br>
<br>
#3 - this thread will be locked soon, and i've decided to leave it here. after experiencing the 'nomaru whirlwind' i know exactly what Xian Le means. he is playing head games and EXTREMELY bordering on severe stalking here. He has hurt far more people than other people i've banned from the messageboards. at the point of locking it, i will edit the title to include the known characters of Nomaru.<br>
<br>
#4 - i will not lock it immediately. if you have major problems with it or feel i'm being rude or whatever, please let me know. hsian_li@yahoo.com or post here<br>
<br>
the reason for all this: STOP THE DRAMA! Vind, just walk away. Xian Le et. al, use 3 very important commands:<br>
1) /ignore &lt;name&gt;<br>
if he creates a new character/logs on another:<br>
2) /report &lt;name&gt; <br>
3) /petition i have instructed &lt;name&gt; not to talk to me and put him on my ignore filter. he is now logging onto other characters to talk to me and i cannot prevent this.<br>
<br>
my decision to suspend/ban posters to this messageboard is arbitrary and my own. i do not want to do this, i do not want to be so firm and mean, but this shit has to stop.<br>
<br>
Xian-monkie-not-the-Nyaa-princess-Xian-Le-so-THERE!<br>
<br>
p.s. i'm going to suggest to Nomaru/Vind the very same thing i just e-mailed him, in the hopes he reads it soon.<br>
WALK AWAY. do NOT bother these people. go do something else. <br>

To the guild nyaa I messaged a few of you and did my best to help fix this situation as fast as i could. All I can do is appologize that you had this kind of problem with one of our guildmembers. I anything should ever happen like this again with one of our members please feel free to contact me and I will address your issues to the hc.<br>
<br>
Vin read my post on the guild message board and please consider it you need to take a break from this game. I also didnt see the majority of these people attacking you some did but most seemed very concerned about you think about what they have said.You have taken a game and took it to a level of seriousness I never thought possible. Take a break reevaluate how you played and think on if this is a game you need to keep playing.  As I said I wish you the best of luck in the future and hope you resolve any problems you are having.<br>

I have always used these boards as a warning for being around people that could significantly reduce my ability to have fun in EQ.  Nomaru has been on my /ignore list for several months for bringing is real life mental problems into the game for me.  I dont need or want that.  I was not surprised at all to see him here.  I feel bad for Nomaru/whoever.<br>
<br>
I also think the level of social drama that has played out here is a significant indication as to the amount of social trama he has dished out to the people involved here.<br>

<br>
This guy is a head case.  I remember one time I was in thurg at the bank makin some  potions and just generally chilling out.  And out of nowhere nomaru starts talkin to me in tells.  Im a friendly guy, and if Im not doing anything Im always willing to talk.  If Im busy I can be curt : \<br>
<br>
well I wasnt busy so we talked, and he went into this seemingly obsessive story about his current soap opera.  Some girl he loves blah blah.  I dont remember the details, but I tried to talk sense to him about online loves.  I tried to tell him not to get so wrapped up in it, and I suggested he take up yoga(hee hee).  I laughed the whole time he went on.  <br>
<br>
Then later his "wife" of the week shows up and asked to join my guild.  She was unhappy that her guild was not paying her attention so she joined my guild to make them *edit*take notice of her*edit*.  One striking thing was she said to me "what would you say if I said I love you", I think I said something like "That your crazy".  She also mentioned she was devorcing the said, that reminded me of thurg and I giggled.  Then she left the guild, as I expected.<br>
<br>
  Then a few days later, I get an ass boat of tells from nomaru about this chick.  What did she say, what did she say???  All kinds of weird shit, like did she cheat on me crap.  I thought "damn, bro your fucked up".  He goes on about it obsessively, I try telling hey man if your that concerned about her cheating on you just end it.  Hoping in futility that would land some sense in his twisted world.  Then it hit me, what if he was both people and he wanted me to tell him that she said she loved me.  I mean, it seemed so twisted and improbable, but there was something going on.  So, I did what anyone would do, I toyed with him.  Subtle suggestions, yet steadfast rejection of admission.  He ate it up like candy, seemed like he liked it.  I thought "damn, bro your fucked up".<br>
<br>
I think the bottom line is this guy isnt evil or malicious.  I think he just has a desperate desire to star on a soap opera.  His ethics and his decision making are definately flawed, and he is definately annoying.  But I think he does this all out of a desire to be in a soap opera, not to hurt people. <p> <a href="mailto:dreamingwolfmail@home.com"><img src="http://www.fortunecity.com/bennyhills/flower/152/dwsig.gif" border="0"></a></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/udreamingwolf.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dreamingwolf</A> at: 6/12/01 12:13:13 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uerick99.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Erick99</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>p0\/\/3r-p0sT3r!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(6/12/01 12:25:58 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Vindication..imean..nomaru...i mean Inspiration..i mean.</span><hr size=1> Nandanine, do whatever you have to do in order to remedy this situation and have fun again.

<br>
Just so you didn't get the wrong impression, Nom...I didn't consider that harassment. Annoying, yes, but not harassment. Heck, I'm a guild leader, and I sometimes have a real big mouth on these forums. You wouldn't believe the tell hell I can get into sometimes. It happens. Sure, I found it a bit annoying, but I don't and didn't feel that it was harassment. There is usually at least a week's delay for anyone who wants to join GoD unless they are a real life friend/family member of a respected guild mate, simply because of the rules we have involving prospective members.<br>
<br>
Do I believe Xianle in this issue? Yes I do. That is all I will say on this subject. <p><center><img src="http://guardiansofdawn.homestead.com/files/sigjeanfin.jpg">

I've never been as scared in my EQ life as now.  There is a string of posts on Dark Reign's Officer's board regarding you Nomaru/Kessen/whoever you are called now.  It ends with the determination that all of us in DR hoped that your messed up EQ personality didn't translate directly to your RL personality.<br>

<br>
i will now lock this thread, but please please heed my warning.<br>
<br>
Nomaru/Vind/Insp/whoever, Xian Le, et al:<br>
this issue is not to be be brought up to the boards.  if he continues to harrass you after this point by all means let me know and i will re-open the thread here.  nomaru if you are in turn harrassed let me know and i will re-open the thread here.<br>
<br>
Specifically to Nomaru: I spoke against this earlier, I think its judgemental and unprofessional.  However, i've received a lot of e-mail about the things you have done in the past, how you are presently, etc.  and i'm going to ask you to please just walk away from this.  take a step back.  consider seeing a counsellor to deal with anger management and jealousy issues, most of all, learn how to let go.  these are crucial life lessons that simply ruin the happiness of others if you do not learn them.  <br>
<br>
by doing what you've done the past while, including what you've done to Xianle and her guild by continuously harassing them, to Nand by posting what were obviously private (if real at all) messages, to Laque by scaring the piss out of her last night, and to the Lanys community by your very eeby-jeeby vibe, <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> you are really ruining the intended fun of this game.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
i don't have much more to say.  i will seriously consider banning any poster who attempts to circumvent this ruling.  if you want to have more posted on this message board about this, send me an e-mail first.  i consider this issue closed, everyone is now aware of the problems (and potential real life threat) of Nomaru in this game, and to further this post is simply to continue the soap opera.<br>
<br>
locking now<br>
