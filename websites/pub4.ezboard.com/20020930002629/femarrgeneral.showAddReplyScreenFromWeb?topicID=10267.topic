<br>
Most guilds, as I understand it, rely totally on the guild leader, usually in consultation with officers, to decide who gets the goodies.  The problem being, of course, no matter how hard they try, soon or later they get accused of favouritism and patronage of a chosen few.<br>
<br>
Eventually a disgruntled cabal forms, harsh words are said, and BANG, half your guild resigns and goes and forms a new guild, leaving acrimony and flame-wars in their wake.<br>
<br>
In CE, you get a point for every raid and/or boss mob taken down where you are in attendance.  Loot is allocated a point value of 1, 5, 10, 15, or 20.  If you want the loot, you spend your loot points to get it.  If two or more people want the same loot, whoever has the highest number of points stored up automatically wins the item.<br>
<br>
Result?  If you attend more raids, you build up more loot points, you get more loot.  If you attend less raids, you get less loot.  Best of all, everyone know how many points people have, and they know that when someone gets loot, its because they earnt it.  No patronage, no favouritism, no guild politics.<br>
<br>
I understand MF operate something similar, only there are no fixed-point values on loot items.  When loot drops, you bid for it with your points, and the person who makes the highest bid wins the item.<br>
<br>
Now I know this has a high administrative overhead.  You need to record  who attended what raids so people get their points.  You need to maintain a central list of people’s point counts.  <br>
<br>
However, surely it’s worth it if it can stop all the guild implosions over loot?<br>
<br>
I'm curious to hear how other guilds manage to avoid falling out over loot?<br>

I've argued for and against point systems.  I believe that people that show up more should get referrential treatment, but at the same time, keeping up with points is a pain.  I really don't think there is a perfect method of loot distribution.  Maybe if it wasn't such a big deal could it be fairly distributed without someone feeling shorted. <p>"I will take love wherever I find it and offer it to everyone who will take it, seek knowledge from those wiser, and teach those who wish to learn from me" - Duane Allman</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ubulvyne.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bulvyne</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 294<br> <font color=#E9D756>(8/2/02 4:53:26 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrgeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=10267.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Fair Ways to Distribute Guild Loot</span><hr size=1> Points systems are a complicated, time-consuming matter. Just creating the system can be quite an effort, but if your guild is serious about high-end stuff and the fair distribution of that stuff, I do not believe there to be a fairer system.<br>
<br>
I've been in guilds with just about every loot system there is. But for every allocation/random type system, there's always holes in them big enough to stick a golem through. <br>
<br>
Having been using a points system in MF darned near since we created the guild, I am convinced that it is about as fair as it gets. Yes, there ARE still ways to &quot;bend&quot; the system, but not nearly as much as with other systems.<br>
<br>
Many of the &quot;uber&quot; guilds on other servers also have custom points-based systems. <br>
<br>
With an officer &quot;allocation&quot; system, the chance for favortism is always there, and eventually, as Ysall said, the officers get accused of it, and people are unhappy. I was in a certain guild whose officers actually allocated loot to their own camped twinks rather than to people playing their mains who were present for the loot drop.<br>
<br>
With a random system, the &quot;randomness&quot; can be a sore-spot... nothing like watching a first-drop for a guild go to someone who happened to be present for the drop, who only plays once every 3 months. OR, nothing like watching player_X win his third straight item due to the &quot;luck&quot; of the random. <br>
<br>
The bottom-line, though, is that no single system is &quot;perfect&quot;. A guild has to talk amongst themselves and decide which system THEY think is perfect. Some guilds have used allocation schemes and are completely happy with that. <br>
<br>
But to answer your question: A random-sytem is the easiest to run. Everyone who is interested sends a tell to a person doing the random, the die is rolled, tada!  The officer-allocation is a little tougher only because most officers will actually try to make people happy, knowing in advance that someone will usually always be unhappy about a distribution decision. The Points system, tho, is the most difficult simply because points must be tracked, someone who is trusted must track them (Hooray Tuan!), and all of this can be an administrative nightmare.<br>

I have always been in the more casual guilds and always opposed the point system.<br>
<br>
For instance, we raid every Friday night. If your online you need to be at the raid. Thats great and we usually have a pretty good turnout. Then you have those that work weekends or are on a totally different time zone and not able to attend the Friday night raid. Lets say these guildmembers may not be able to attend the raids due to RL interference, but when they are online they are a real value to the guild, always helping others and just a down right good guild member. With the point system lets say this member was on vacation and able to attend the raid. Woohoo, but he would be left out at the chance of a nice item.<br>
<br>
You pretty much sum'd it up for me that in raiding guilds the point system is great, but in the more casual guilds it wouldn't work so well. Is that correct?<br>

If someone were to win 3 randoms in a row, people would be jealous.  If someone were to be allocated 3 pieces of armour to your no pieces because people decided they needed it....you would be jealous.<br>
<br>
If everyone and i mean EVERYONE in the guild never argued and trusted each other COMPLETLEY....then this system and random system is cool.<br>
<br>
However, people in guilds naturually make enemys, people they dont like and people you feel whom contribute less than you.<br>
<br>
I say again, in a perfect world the random/allocation system is fine...and if the guild doesnt raid much.<br>
<br>
I prefer the points system, it makes you choose what you want to roll on harder (thus letting people who NEED it roll more) and encourages you to take part more. <p><C>Hoppkins Wytchfinder

If they don't like it at that time, they should choose another guild.<br>
<br>
It doesnt really matter what system you use as long as you stick to it. If you use officer allocation, the officers know they have to be careful or alienate guildmembers. If you use points, make sure the rules on earning and spending are clear.<br>
<br>
Officer Allocation is better for promoting a stronger guild...Officers can outfit those who would benefit the guild more like the main tank...but, alot of people have trouble seeing that with a better equiped main tank they will be more successful as a guild.<br>
<br>
Point systems allow everyone to feel they have a chance at something. They definately favor those who participate more, but a guild that needs a loot system is probably trying to promote participation. Whether you use fixed points or a bidding system is a personal choice. They both have advantages and disadvantages.<br>
<br>
The bottom line is that no loot system is 100% fair. Someone will always complain because the world is full of whiners who will blame the system. As long as the rules are clear and concrete, you can point the rules board and say, 'look, you know how it is and chose to live with it by staying in the guild so shut up.'<br>
<br>
If you somehow develop a loot system that is incredibly unfair, like, say, Guild leader and officers get ALL the loot until we dont want any more, then we will let you guys random for it, don't worry, you won't have any guildmembers whining.<br>

<br>
Did that sound right?<br>
<br>
Like, if I, as a ranger, attended every single Magister raid, and then gauntlets of hooperdoo dropped, ac 20, +125hps, +20 all saves, +10 all stats. One of the guild MA warriors is wearing gaunts with +50hps on them, and I outbid him, and win them. That's 75hps lost on any CH chain they run.<br>
<br>
Or, lets say one of the guild warriors outbids a rogue on a dagger that's 16/20. Warriors get inferior piercing caps, but that's still a very nice ratio, but in the hands of a rogue it'd be a lot more destructive.<br>
<br>
Hopefully I've cleared things up, but I think Magister is far too trusting of impartiability. Just because you can clear Vex Thal while watching three simultaneous porn movies doesn't mean you're unafflicted by human impairment. <br>
<br>
This isn't to say they can't be impartial, merely that I'd be wary of a system like that.<br>
<br>
 And, I think Magister is too constricting on &quot;the value of the guild&quot; in terms of some items. Lots of end game guilds promote rangers for end game DPS, but magister seems to place a heavier emphasis on monks and rogues. Not that they're wrong for their preference, but it's kind of unfair to rangers in the guild if their DPS is considered less iimportant than this or that classes DPS.<br>
<br>
Just some of my thoughts. Overall I think Magister does a great job as an end game guild, and their system is probably very fair, just not for me.<br>
<br>
Ideally I'd want a point based raid attendance system, with penalties and bonuses to classes that get the most for it. Tanks get bonuses for items with 75+ hitpoints, everyone else gets attrition. Rangers get bonuses for bows, rogues get bonuses for daggers, etc. <br>
<br>
In the end, I think you'd end up with a guild with happier players outfit in gear they prefer, and where attendance is heavily encouraged (not that's already not)<br>

There will always be griping. There will always be hurt feelings, and bruised egos.

<br>
This is very much a possibility in point based systems and similar cases do happen from time to time.. but on the whole people bid toward specific goals, spending points on any ol' drop just lessens the likelihood of you getting the good stuff down the line.<br>
<br>
Most times bids are fairly conservative but when that dream drop appears the bids can skyrocket - most would say to be patient and that it'll come but the reality with this is that boredom, expansions, and competition all take their toll after awhile and eventually those items stop entering the guild - so conventional wisdom says if you want a dream drop you need to save your points.<br>

If you assign loot, the loot person basically has to make an arbitrary decision about who the item will most benefit.  The points systems are basically numbers assigned for the value of loot, and the value of the raider's time committment.<br>
<br>
In all cases, you deal with someone assigning their values to the guilds loot and time.  The various sytems are simply ways of dressing it up to seem unbiased and impartial.  But they all stem from someone sitting down and using thier slant on what is &quot;better.&quot;  <br>
<br>
In truth, if you have folks who really are friends, or at least can take the long view about the betterment of everyone, any loot system will work.<br>
<br>
Loot systems are really only needed for those folks who have lost sight of the fact that this is only a game.  The more folks are wrapped up in the illusion of loot equalling accomplishment, the more complex the rules need to be.  For folks that are concerned about having fun, and concerned about the people behind the screens, loot is just not an issue. <p>Myzzan Masterpoet -Vivix Protectorate.  Voted "Miss Vivix 2001"

<br>
When I've decided loot I also had the motto everyone needs a good weapon(or 2).  For &quot;benefit to the guild&quot;, that means putting the good hp armor/taunting weapons on the main tanks, the good daggers into the hands of the rogues, the FT items on the healers/casters.  Try to be fair to everyone and reward items to whom need it or deserve it.  By any means its no simple task but I can say I always tried to be fair and tried to keep everyone happy as I could.<br>

I also saw loot allocation there, and in RE..  While Loot was nearly impartial in RE, it would not be hard to start thinking certain people were being favored, or sometimes not understanding why someone got X item (not accusing anyone, especially since i could be viewed as one of the favored while i was there.  Just saying you could see it that way if you wanted to).<br>
<br>
I have not experienced a point system, but i now see how it could be a good thing.  Its impartial, and you know someone has spent the time to earn the item. <p><a href='http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=248327'>Birren Anklebiter</a><BR>
