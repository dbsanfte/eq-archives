I would like to hear how others think of life after death.  An eternity of adam and eve lifestyle?(no im not talking about the porn material)  Walking around picking vegies from the farm in the nude?  Psychotically waving our bodies around while praying to God for 23 of 24 hours in a day?  Pretending to be &quot;faithful&quot; to God so you are guarenteed life in &quot;heaven&quot;?  Feeling like you have no free-will cause God is micromanaging your life?  Scared life will be just plain-old boring?  Yep, I believe this is one of the major reasons why people don't feel good about a relationship with God.  Their insecurities about the &quot;unknown&quot;.  You know, that ignorance word.  We fear what we don't know.

 <br>
 Only thing im afraid of is when i die,that i havent done all the things in life i could have done.I try to take risks and have fun and enjoy the time i have with my family and friends.I just dont understand the people that dont take any ricks.Who on there death bed is saying &quot;Im glad i didnt live my life like i had 1 day to live&quot;. <br>

 I believe we should live everyday like there isnt a tomorrow.Maybe spend more time with family and friends telling them how much you love them.You never know when your life or theres will be cut short.<br>

There is probably no such thing. Humans, being very intelligent animals, create fictions to make themselves feel better so they can cope with real life tragedies. Life after death is such a fiction.<br>

I believe those who believe as you do are more brave than those who don't believe.  It takes courage to live life and go through so many pains and still know how to love.  There are many people who have been through painful times and refuse or forget how to love(Lurikeen comes to mind).  Believe what you want to believe Lurikeen.  You are a coward.  People think and they feel.  Both are very important.  Thoughts represent an attempt at truth and feelings represent an attempt towards love.  Being able to juggle both in your life makes you Brave Ogkrum and I commend you : )    <br>
<br>
I have a feeling that the love and truth you have harnessed in life are what you will expect after death.  I believe life after death will have all of the fascinating obstacles and endevors of life as we know it.  Except that we won't be bound by our nature and twisted ideals of social acceptance.  I have known many people who have died (including family members) and would love to see them again.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ufeathersilverthorn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Feather Silverthorn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 130<br> <font color=#E9D756>(11/26/01 11:19:02 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=246.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Life after death?</span><hr size=1> Life After death to me is simple.<br>

If you have Children, love them, nurture them, read to them, watch movies with them, chase them around the yard yelling at the top of your lungs, make meories for them that are good and strong.<br>

What one believes about a afterlife has nothing to do with "courage". I do not think those who believe there is an afterlife are cowardly because they choose to believe what I think is a fairy tale.<br>
<br>
I would argue that those who believe as I do have an opportunity to enjoy every waking moment knowing that this life is final when we exhaust our last breath. Indeed, love and relationships are more meaningful knowing that I will never see those I love once I die.<br>
<br>
Hmmm... I suppose it takes much courage to live today knowing that if you die there is no second chance to make things better. <p>Lurikeen Mali'Kyre<BR>

And I htink its great how you feel about life(a bit depressing though- I picture you loving people and spreading joy but stabbing yourself in the heart at the sametime)  I do see the good and advantageous things about atheism.  That makes sense to me.  And I'm not trying to change your mind but am expressing my thoughts and feelings on the matter and i want to apologize for getting a bit pissy and insulted by your &quot;eaten by worms&quot; statement.  I guess its easy for me to belive in afterlife because of a few simple beleifs of mine.  I don't believe anyone is better than anyone else.  and Yes I mean I am no better than Adolf Hitler or Jefferey Dahmer or Stalin or Saddam Heusein......the list goes on.  We are all equal.  Not because of truth but because of love.  I personally believe that we are all at fault for the so-called, 'bitten apple' or 'forbidden fruit'.  Basically we wanted to do it all on our own so God said&quot;ok good luck&quot; and now we are bound by nature.  So death for me isnt exactly something I look forward to, but, at the same time, it is something I am glad will eventually occur.  While the truth reveals, love creates.  Sad to me that in todays society sooo many people base their ideas and beliefs on scientific based thought.  Scientific based thought doesn't encounter such a thing as 'afterlife' and because science is empirical it will never encounter life after death.  Science in this case is limited.  Science is a system of logic which is based on sensual perception and thoughts.  It gives NO CREDABILITY to feelings.  Hence science is limited.   However truth combined with love(or thought combined with feeling) is NOT LIMITED.  Your passion is strong my friend.  Don't limit that passion and block it with thoughts of simple empirical data.  You are regarding feelings as inferior to thought by taking such an emperical stance(emperical, meaning scientific) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/bemarr.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=xamael>Xamael</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 7<br> <font color=#E9D756>(11/27/01 3:39:45 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=246.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Life after death</span><hr size=1> Dear all,<br>

           Brutas is a spoiled brat. He's living in his own world where his mother probably serves im breakfast in bed every single morning and he probably throws a tantrum because its not the food he wanted. Hell, he might have been breastfed well into his teen years not to mention the accompanied baths. Whatever he wants, mommy and daddy will give it to him. Now that he has learned his ABCs and found out about Everquest, he decided to try out the game.<br>
<br>
          One day, he discovered this message board and decided in his little puny mind that its time to make it his. So when the hot topic about God and religion (his fav I guess) comes up he decides to post. He praises the people that believes what he believes cos that makes them his 'friends'. He curses the ones that don't share his views cos he can't stand what he's hearing. This makes the people that give different views 'the bad people'. Everyone must have the exact thinking as him cos that's the way he likes it. He is nothing more but a little brat so entertain him if u want as I have no time and need to go to work.<br>

Find some other believer in God who talks about the issues rather than pull some quote form the bible as proof.  Your upset Xamael.  Your not an atheist Xamael.  If you were, you wouldn't feel the need to refute my opinions.  By refuting my opinions you are suggesting that you want justice or some type of recognition.

I find the idea of a &quot;fallen nature&quot; very interesting from the standpoint of how all of humanity (from a theological point of view) suffers a single condition base upon the alleged actions of two individuals. So god condemed every person from Adam and Eve onward because those two failed to behave? Do you really see that as justice? And, for that matter what does that say of the character of the individual who established the &quot;rule&quot; to begin with? After all, god knew before Adam and Eve were created that they would partake of the forbidden fruit, right? No, the tale told of our so-called fallen nature is just too convenient for the story teller and does not do an adequate job at explaining &quot;evil&quot; in the world and &quot;justice&quot;. <br>

<br>
I agree that the scientific community would be hard pressed to offer a viable explanation of &quot;life after death&quot;. However, that is because science in general is about what can be observed in principle and doesn't like to muck about with things that should be left to theologians and philosophers to ponder, such as &quot;Life after death&quot;. We should not be quick to condemn Empiricism out right. I am not an Empircist (as you indicate), but rather a Pragmatist. As such, I do not even think of trying to convince others that there is no life after death. Hey, if belief in an afterlife comforts people then why even try to take it away? It works in providing many benefits to people. Hell, if people will obey the laws because they think they will burn in hell I benefit! Let them believe, but because I fail to believe doesn't mean that I am magically bereft of feeling or emotion, or that I am immoral. Just because I fail to believe doesn't make me an automaton of science!<br>

I do believe in life after death.  My belief is that those who have accepted Christ will join Him in Heaven.  I also believe that those who did not know Christ shall be judged by God for what they did know, not what they didn't.  Meaning, even non-christians, etc., will have that same chance to dwell in Heaven with the Lord.  Yeah, so I believe in God.  Ok, flame me for it <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
It does offer comfort to me to know that I shall see my Grandfather on the other side.  What is even better though is knowing that if my children and other family members also accept Christ, that I'll be seeing them too.  <br>
<br>
I do believe this to the depths of my soul.  A year ago, I really didn't, but a lot of changes have come about this past year, and I do owe them to God and the work He has done through people in my life.<br>

If you ask though what Heaven looks like to me, well, all I really know is that I'll be with God, eternally.  There will be no evil, no suffering, no pain, and that my time here on earth will be but a millisecond in comparison.<br>
<br>
White fluffy clouds and harp-strumming angels?  Not sure thats my idea of decor... but hey, I won't knock it.  An eternity there will be much much better than one moment on earth without God.  Which incidentally is all that I think Hell is.. an eternity without God.  Yeah yeah, I know theres lots of debate about that kind of thing.  Lots of religions tout the image of a demon slowly roasting you over a burning fire and cackling gleefully all becuse you lied once.. blah.. so glad I don't buy into the entire works based thing.<br>
<br>
Which also kinda reminds me.. Lurikeen.. in one paragraph there you asked a whole lotta theological questions.. whatever you believe, if you'd like one version of the answers.. I'd be happy to email them to you.  It'll be my own compilation from several books, speakers, and theologians on the subject, as I had those same questions before last year.. like why did God allow Adam and Eve to even eat the forbidden fruit.. etc.  The answers would take up a bit of space here, and honestly, I am sure would open a huge flame (especially if Muzaak sees this, he always flames my posts).  Anyways, if you'd like, email me.. lukaria@hotmail.com or if you want I can post here.  Let me know which you'd prefer.  Do keep in mind, it is only one version, though the one I personally believe <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

 &quot;Lurikeen, while I was reading your post I felt so sad for you. And I htink its great how you feel about life(a bit depressing though- I picture you loving people and spreading joy but stabbing yourself in the heart at the sametime)&quot;<br>
<br>
  That wasn't BS <br>
 ____________________________________________________ <br>
      I find the idea of a &quot;fallen nature&quot; very interesting from the standpoint of how all of humanity (from a theological point of view) suffers a single condition base upon the alleged actions of two individuals. So god condemed every person from Adam and Eve onward because those two failed to behave? Do you really see that as justice? And, for that matter what does that say of the character of the individual who established the &quot;rule&quot; to begin with? After all, god knew before Adam and Eve were created that they would partake of the forbidden fruit, right? No, the tale told of our so-called fallen nature is just too convenient for the story teller and does not do an adequate job at explaining &quot;evil&quot; in the world and &quot;justice&quot;. <br>
<br>
       Why do we associate truth with pain and/or suffering?  The Bible isn't my expertise but, we have free-will and can choose to drive a hot wire coat hanger in our schlongs if we so choose.  Call it pain if you want.  That recognition of a resulting feeling will be your reality.  However, the pain(feeling) is a result of a choice made which wasn't very thoughtful.  Hence, the answers are in the truth.  The reality of those answers don't always paint a pretty picture(although the picture of someone's face as a result of the 'coat hanger' incident is pretty funny, while the picture of it's insertion is not).  This moron made a choice which had very litle balance of thought and feeling(in its non-perverse form, truth and love)  I'm not a very good writer so I'm not sure if the correlations are clear.  Anyway, the moral of the story is;  Hot wire coat hanger inda pp=truth(not just pain). <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :eek --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/eek.gif ALT=":eek"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  HOWEVER, in order to love someone you must 'truth' them as well.  Call it punishment, discipline if you want. I guess it is, but ultimately it is truth is for one's own good.  Do I feel like God punishes me or disciplines me or 'truths' me?  Yea I do, because I ask for it.  THIS is why so many peps have bad feelings about God and want to punch him in his jock.  Why did your parents make you clean your room, wash behind your ears, not open presents until christmas day, teach you good manners, and/or not drop you in a dumpster when you pissed them off for the first time?  'cause they love you <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    When you were a teenager why did you get pissed off all the time when they said, &quot;clean your room before you go out&quot;  or, &quot;stop ass-fucking the neighbors dog&quot;  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :smokin --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smokin.gif ALT=":smokin"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I spilled the beans again, oops.  Because, while we were establishing our independence we were also taking advantage of the situation(their love, or possibly rebeling against their not loving in which case we were actually becoming self-destructive while thinking we were 'getting back at them'.  ----this is not personal psychology, it is stuff we can all relate to,  please don't take personally----<br>
     About justice, I think I said in this post that I don't believe I or anyone else in this world is better than the worst person who ever lived.  Justice is not a weapon, it is a tool(justice in its pure form)  Its a form of truth.  In our perverse way of thinking, we, as a society have come to understand it as revenge.  Not saying that if someone killed someone I knew that I wouldn't chop his balls off, stuf them in his throat then jam his cok in his nose, 'cause I prob would.<br>
<br>
     About evil, evil is that, of which is unneccasary(I've been battling with the spelling of that damn word since the 4th grade)  By unneccasary I mean in its comparison with love and truth.  For the most part justice(how we have claimed it to be) is evil.  <br>

There are other forms of discipline, for example:  giving her looks of guilt, or ignoring her until she would have recognized that she hurt me by doing something that goes against my ideal for her(as I love her and don't want her to suffer)  Certain scenarios require certain forms of mirrored truth.  <br>
      We are like children.  When we reach a certain intellectual maturity we question everthing that we choose to question.  Why did that coat hanger incident hurt me so bad?  I didn't derserve that kind of bullshit.  I'm gonna blowup the factory that made them.  I'm gonna beat someone with a stick and spread the hate until God takes notice(WTC incident is good comparison)  I'm also going to not love myself until God brings his ass down here and says sorry.  Anyway, your a smart cookie Lurikeen.  I don't think I have to give more examples. One other thing.  I recognize and agree with your earlier statement about Lurkaria which says that you empathize and sympathize with his idea of spreading Christianity.  I would like to recognize your open-mindedness.  There aren't many people who have da'kahunas to say soemhting like that after flaming him to a burnt-crisp.  Hehe, I've had my ass toated on these boards too I must admit <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I disagree with the idea of &quot;free will&quot;. As a Determinist I would say certain events and conditions caused the moron to inflict pain upon himself. From my point of view individuals do not even choose pleasurable acts. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  For instance, my physical construction may predispose me to enjoy certain tactile sensations you would not enjoy. Further, &quot;desires&quot; to entertain those tactile sensations would only be noticed by me under certain conditions. Most of the time I do not want to eat a chocolate candy bar, but every time I pass them at the grocery store I find myself wanting one. Some individuals are predisposed such that they can't walk by a candy bar display without buying one. My disposition allows me to walk by. I do not choose to walk by, conditions are such that I can walk by without buying one. I think that &quot;free will&quot; is an illusion. Individuals want to believe they are ultimately in control of their present and futures, but they are not. Personally, I gain great comfort understanding that what happens tomorrow is out of my control.<br>
<br>
Given a glimpse of my view above you can see how I might think concerning topics such as &quot;Justice&quot;. You brought up the exploits involved in raising children (I have some experience with that)... one thing I have observed is that children, for the most part, haven't a fucking clue about what it is they are doing! :P They exemplify what I point at above. Their physical &quot;make up&quot; and environment push and pull them to behave certain ways. Punishment and rewards become tools by which we change their environment to elicit desired behaviors. Most of the time children behave a certain way which causes parents to behave a certain way and it just goes back and forth. I will not belabor this further. I think you get the gist of what I am saying.<br>

I think you are alluding to something other than property of omniscience which is attributed to the god of most western theologies. What I think you are pointing to is something more like an &quot;educated guess&quot; that can only come through experience. You might have an educated guess that a child will toss food onto the carpet when given opportunity, but you do not know that the child will, in fact, toss food. The child may never toss food onto the carpet, as far as you know. But the idea of omniscience is that god *knows* event X will occur at t1 before it actually does. Indeed, he knew that the killer of John F. Kennedy would gun down the president before the killer was even born. In a real sense, the killer of JFK had no choice at all but to kill, if god is omniscient! Which brings me to &quot;justice&quot;... it is not at all just to punish one for actions they could not prevent due to god's foreknowledge (omniscience). In the case of the story of Adam and Eve it would not be just to punish all future individuals based upon actions Adam and Eve couldn't help but do. God knows that they will eat the forbidden fruit prior to creating them, yet he creates them and the fruit by which they are tempted! (Makes one wonder if god has &quot;free will&quot;?) Again, this is not like popping out a kid guessing that you will have to punish a misbehavior one day (educated guess). Alledgedly, this is a being that creates knowing full well that he will banish them from his presence shortly there after. So why the fuck would I want to spend an eternity with such a monster should he actually exist? I can unequivocally say that if I had to face that monster I would beg for hell knowing that an eternity out of his presence would truly be bliss. Think about it. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>Lurikeen Mali'Kyre<BR>

Knew somehow I'd not get by.  Didn't even read the other posts between you and Brut, I'll let you two have fun with whatever you are arguing atm.<br>
<br>
Btw, yes, you're right, I wasn't being arrogant.  I was, indeed as you guessed, attempting to be helpful.  Which of course is why I added the disclaimers that these were my own conclusions and only one viewpoint.  Obviously, there are theologians and scholars out there that know much more than I.<br>
<br>
And actually, I didn't view your questions as retorical at all.  Those questions are actually HUGE barriers for many many people when looking at Christianity.  They actually are really good questions, and have been asked many times by people.  Many theologians have answered them.  Some people think they did ok, some people don't.  Some people believe anyways, some don't.  You might think they are retorical, but many people don't. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Anyways, have fun arguing.  And brutus222... just letting you know, you're not really advancing your case much when you call people's mother's names etc.  And I think I really need to say, you're not really advancing God either, but then I am not sure you wish too.  You state over and over that you don't care whether someone believes in God or not, even though you do think it has eternal repurcussions.  That shows a huge lack of love on your part for your fellow man.  I'm glad you have a relationship with God.  If you really love God that much, I'd think you'd want to spread the joy.  If you were concerned about spreading the joy, I think you'd be a bit more loving of your fellow humans.  Don't insult their Mom's.. they see that and they won't listen.<br>
<br>
Obviously I won't revist this thread, as I'm sure to be flamed for that one.  Kinda tired of trolling the boards anyways.  <br>

Sometimes people don't see the result of what they are saying.  The result of his ideals of after life were exemplified by my picture of his mom.  Of course I don't want to hurt his feelings.  And I don't believe I ddi.  I just think I threw a wrench in his 'system' of logic.  When people base their ideals only with recognition of their thoughts, they automatically lose touch with their feelings, which is the MAIN point I have been trying to make in much of my threads.  Feeling is half of who we are and it is being ignored and/or devalued by many people.  Yes, I went a little overboard with his 'mom'.  But owell.  Him saying that my relationship with God is a figment of my imagination is pretty insulting.  What he got was a mirror image of what he said to me.  A few have already suggested as such.  But Xamael was the one with Zero substance.  So, he was the straw thatbroke the camel's back.  Ask Xamael if he likes the thought of his mom with regardsto what i said.  Then ask him about God and/or a higher diety, afterlife ect....    He ignored his feeling until I pissed him off.  Then the dam broke and the valley was flooded with emotion.  LOL.  And BOY did he get pissed off, hehe.  If he loves his mother that much wait till he has kids.  And tell him that stuff is the reality for his kids.  He would prob shoot me through the cpu screen 'cause he doesn't know anything of love till he has his own children.  Thats when someone can really understand what love is and how powerful it is.  And how powerful God's love is for his children.  And how powerful an act of love was for His son, Jesus to die for his Children.  THAT, my friend is some Powerful stuff.  I'm glad Xamael was sticking up for his mom, who he loves.   I'm glad he was pissed at me and nothing he could say would make me angry cause I was happy that he expressed how strongly he loved his mom.

Stuff most peps don't understand.  Communication might at times(depending on the person) caress someone or it can stab at someone's heart.  I am sure God understood what I was getting at and don't believe I hurt him or Lurikeen's thoughts of God(or Triff and Xamael for that matter)  BUT, I was speaking to them when I made those analogies and comparison's, not you my friend.  Different language for different peps.  I have thrived as a person in life for having soo many differnet types of friends.  I like different peps and learn much form people like Lurikeen and already have btw.(something very important)   Speaking in the form of Truth and Love have the same ultimate goals but can sound very different.  I love God and Jesus and am proud to say that my relationship with God and Jesus is based on my personal relationship with them.  I did not grow up going to church every sunday, treat people with love then come monday treat people like shit.(not that you have or other church goers have)  The things I am expressing to you aren't just facts I have been convinced of believing.  This is stuff I have learned.  Funny how my mother purposely did not put me in catholic school and really didn't teach me anythign of God.  She was forced too much when she was younger and wanted me to be able to make my own choices.  I did.  They are my choices and not a pot of soil I was put in.  I found the soil myself, threw my own experiences.  Nothing against peps that did otherwise.  Some peps might call my comments speculation or ideals, but what I say(for the most part) are FACTS.  I will one day die for this truthly love and lovely truth.  WHICH Xamael will too one day.  When he has children.  He will die for his children as Jesus died for his.  Doesn't matter if others aprove for his way of thinking.  Doens't matter if he dies with his middle finger pointed towards 'heaven'.  It matters that he dies loving his children and sacrificing his life for his children.  That is enough to understand God and how much he loves us.  And doing as Jesus did is more important than what religion you are.  I love Xamael.  I love muzaak, lurikeen and triff.

Life will be exciting and not some kind of farmer ho-down.  Unless you so choose it to be.  We will still be exploring this universe and the next.  Still making new things.  Still playing new sports.  Still writing more books.  Its not gonna be some kind of environment where everyone walks around with perma grin like they are high on coke.

If a &quot;God&quot; does exist, you can't fool him.  And you can't fool yourself.  Attempting to deceive yourself will get you no where, weather it be in RL or in the afterlife.<br>

As scary as it sounds to hear myself say it, I really don't believe in any afterlife (atleast not any that I have heard or thought of before), they don't make any sense.  I don't think it's that we cannot comprehend what it is, it just is not logical, or even emotionally logical.<br>
<br>
So after we die and go to this wonderful place called &quot;heaven&quot; while people alive on Earth are left to suffer over the loss of a friend or loved one?  In this &quot;heaven&quot; we are seperate from the ones we care most about? Why would anyone call that heaven?<br>

The normal response seems to be &quot;we will have God to love&quot; or something, well, sorry but that just isn't what I would consider heaven, being taken away from everyone I care about.<br>
<br>
If we are so happy in heaven that would mean that our feelings on this Earth are false, it rips apart everything we currently know about emotions.<br>
<br>
So, who knows what happens to us, but I highly doubt there is any magical place full of happiness.  I don't like saying it, or thinking about it, because it always leads me to the same conclusion. <p>Tuan {Cupcakes} the Vicar</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ulurikeen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lurikeen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 36<br> <font color=#E9D756>(11/29/01 8:37:59 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=246.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Life after death</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> &quot;And actually, I didn't view your questions as retorical at all.

Lukaria, they ARE rhetorical questions, since I not only meant them to be but also asked them in such a manner. I don't need answers to those questions! I think I have the best answers. I could be wrong... have been before, but for now I feel I am right. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
Lukaria it is such remarks that allow me and others to flame you. Don't you see how condescending your snappy little remark is? Might it have occured to you that Brutas and I are actually learning something? Or that we are genuinely sharing our thoughts and feelings? That is the arrogance I have talked about. Lukaria you come off with a false humility to cover up the boiling arrogance beneath the surface. You not only think you are right and have &quot;The Truth&quot; (note the capital &quot;T&quot;) but you believe that all others must bow to YOUR vision of &quot;The Truth&quot;. Oh, sure, you will deny it. I expect as much from the false humility you display. Fact is, Lukaria, you will be happier one day when you realise you are wrong and return to your beliefs with a fresh perspective. You will treat others with respect at that time. <p>Lurikeen Mali'Kyre<BR>

But I really believe he does not mean to be that way.  Not all peps know exactly how to word things.  Communication is difficult on such topics as they are very abstract.  Its hard communicating these ideas in person let alone typing them.  I really believe he is trying to help by expressing what he has experienced but it doesn't work out exactly how he wants.  If he had your literary skills he prob could do better.(hell I wish I had your literary ability; I would be doing much better in school)(Lukaria is an intelligent person, just not connecting with you bro)  you know what I would TOTALLY LOVE TO DO-------GROUP with you, Lukaria(hehe that would be some hilarious shit) and Triff.  Xamael too but think he hates me for sure now.(Xamael would train me I'm sure) <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Actually I think it would a real experience actually talking to you guys in game.
