These guys know how to lead dragon raids. I was at all of the naggy raids that failed last week and i would like to say that before you go to battle at least study your opponent. If you are going to lead a raid at least have co-lead like Coajik says. The only two sucessful raids last week were the ones lead by people who took their time and would not play game with people. If you are going to lead a raid you have to be prepared to remove people just like running a guild. If they dont want to lisen boot them they will get everyone killed. I just came from my second failed vox raid in two days and I am not happy. Yesterday the leader lead eveyone into the pit and today his friend lead everyone in with little or no mr or cr buffs. You cant do this and expect not to fail. The guy tonight did not even have a buffline of any kind. Of course everyone died. Also while on the subject of dragon raids. I do not agree with the reserving of loot. I mean if this is a guild raid and you are helping a guildie out thats different but how do you expect o get paladins to come to a raid (which on vox we are neeeded) if the inly thing they really want is reserved. Thats all i have to say about that. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/usakkathdeath1.showPublicProfile?language=EN>sakkathdeath1</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 205<br> <font color=#E9D756>(7/31/02 12:22:34 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3497.topic&index=25>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I agree with Coajik</span><hr size=1> After helping with a few Vox CR's recently, what shocks me is not so much the leadership of these raids as the followers...<br>
Maybe it's just because schools out, or maybe it's because the velious/luclin expansions have allowed very good gear to trickle down and so people are levelling faster. People whos first characters are powerleveled to 50 with a day or two played just don't know how to play the game.<br>
What I've seen is a lack of respect for a DRAGON! This is not the dreadlands, nor the overthere, nor even Karnors - obvious I know, but a lot of people I've seen just don't get that.<br>
<br>
If people where more patient, listened instead of talked, sat still instead of running around and did as they were told I'm sure there'd be more successes. I also think camping to chat is a great idea and isn't done enough now. It may be uneccessary since targetgroupbuff and the like, but it calms peoples nerves, allows them to ask questions and focuses their minds. <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=34812>Sakkath D'Eath<br>

This, I realized later, was the point of the raid that I should have left... Oh well, CR's build character right?  Well, Even if they don't really build character, at least they teach you whom not to follow into a dragon's lair next time.<br>

<br>
Oh and another thing- If you have never been on a succesful dragon raid- maybe you shouldn't lead one.  However, If you have been on a successful dragon raid- then you should try to mimic whatever that raid leader did.  <br>
<br>
Those people that go to Naggy and Vox are not interested in killing the dragons in a new and interesting way - they just want the fuggin loot.  So if you are leading a Pick-Up Naggy or Vox, just follow the formula that has been done and worked now for a very long time.<br>
<br>
The comment earlier from Parum stated...<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  How many times did Da'Kor die to Phara Dar before being the first in game to kill her?  <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> This proves my point perfectly, Parum you don't seem to understand that Vox and Naggy HAVE been killed many many times before and there are ways of doing it that have been proven to work- this is not some guild experiment trying to do something on the server that has never been done before- it's something that if done properly even a damn Pick-Up raid can do.  I would suggest that you don't lead any more dragon raids until you attend a few more successful ones first.<br>
<br>
I will however give all of you Pick-Up raid leaders Kudos for having the balls to step up and attempt to lead- but I have to suggest that you also make sure you have the tactics to do the job properly. <p><b>  <a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=103923>Dunkamar's Profile</a> <br>

Way before the current bunch of sorry attempts there were leaders such as Kerna - before him Gorndax and Parum, from memory Parum and Kerna didn't fail to take down Vox on one single raid (maybe Gorndax too, I'm unsure). That was was before Luclin and Velious, so people were still on Kunark loot and level 52 or under. I know Parum also once lead a raid with 15 people on it who took down Vox. Maybe some of the people who have lead recently are used to raiding with others that know how to raid - or at least how to listen, pay attention and kill dragons and expect a modicom of intelligence from everyone there (perhaps a mistake). A leader is there to lead - but you can't lead people who aren't capable of following.<br>
<br>
What I have observed on the Vox raids I've come accross is a large number of the attendees talking crap and dude speak about how great they are, instead of listening and concentrating on the task at hand. People who were asked 5 times if they have all the buffs they need and said nothing, yet after the fight complained they had no CR/haste buffs etc. Clerics who, despite being told otherwise - symbol people in their group as their first buff. I have seen people, after being told to wait for a charge call, have all run in (casters included) before even the charge call or the MA had engaged!!! Vox is not a hard dragon - how difficult is it to have the initiative to form a group - just make sure the majority of tanks have a healer in the group. Vox has 32k for god sake - a raid of 45 people (which the last had) required each participant to do just over 700hp damage - I mean come on!!! You just have to listen to instructions to buff right.<br>
<br>
Resists and levels are also an issue - why are level 45 druids coming on these raids with no CR/MR gear? A minimum of 80 CR, 60 MR unbuffed and minimum level of 48 used to be the rule - maybe that's what is going wrong. It's not hard to get to these levels.<br>
<br>
It <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> seriously</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> worries me that the people I've seen on some of these attempts will be levelling up and wanting to participate in higher level encounters, or trying to join the big guilds. I pray to Innoruuk that they learn something and get more of a clue before they try.<br>
<br>
Don't quote people out of context, the 2nd quote you chose had this at the end to qualify the statement<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Maybe this was this guy's first run and he was a bit confused. Thats ok.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Oh well, I thought I'd left Vox behind years ago - but having been dragged in on a couple recently to help clear up and CR people, I've just been shocked at the people who expect to kill a dragon when they have no respect for said dragon, or the courtesy and minimal intelligence required to follow instructions. <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=34812>Sakkath D'Eath<br>

The bard who tried to deal with it could not get it charmed. Without that bad bit of luck, Vox was going down, despite the damned conga line her fear was creating(as Sakkath said, some people seem not to have heard of resist gear. Personally, I think it should be 80/80 for a 50 and add 10 each every level under, especially for clerics, druids, and shaman. Healers with poor resists kill full groups.).<br>
<br>
As to the &quot;create smart groups&quot;, that is a false characterization, as you well know. Everyone was to make up temporary groups that were to take down the six giants that were up at that time. Parum set up regular groups when we actually got to the buff hall.<br>
<br>
The only thing I could fault him for was how buffs were handled. I think he forgot that lots of people who do Vox and Nagafen are actually first time raiders, and leaving it up to them to give tells to the various casters to get buffed up probably resulted in a number of people under or improperly buffed. Despite this, she would have gone down except for a bit of bad luck.<br>
