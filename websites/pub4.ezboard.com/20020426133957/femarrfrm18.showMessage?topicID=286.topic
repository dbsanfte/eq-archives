Saddam is not a threat to the shores of the US. He is only a threat to our precious oil interests in the Persian Gulf. US policy makers could care less about the people in Iraq. Hell, Shrub even went so far to down play the "War on Terror" by dismissing Osama as a risk or concern. So, do you think Shrub is really all that concerned about a terrorist attack on our shores again? Hardly. He is sabre rattling for ratings. If that means he has to push buttons to the extent that the US launches nukes he will do it. He is a dumb @#%$ drunkard who should be taken out of office before he really starts a world war. <p>Lurikeen Mali'Kyre<BR>Necromancer <BR>Proud Member of <a href="http://magustytalus.tripod.com/">The Order of Magus Tytalus</a><BR><BR>"My eyes will pierce your soul, then I will take your life!"<br></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ubrutas222.showPublicProfile?language=EN>brutas222</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 224<br> <font color=#E9D756>(3/13/02 10:45:07 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=286.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Has Shrub lost his Fvcking mind?!</span><hr size=1>   I think its pretty obvious by now that it is extremely difficult to prove 'beyond a shadow of a doubt' who is responsible for a terror attack.  Afghanistan was the easiest possible target in the world.  Everyone hated them.  Even the Arabs.  But what is going to happen when some terrorist lets a dirty nuke kill everything within one sqare mile of a large city(Thats being modest)  Everyone in the world is going to throw up their arms and say, &quot;OH my God I am soo sorry for you America.  We are all praying for you now.  Let us find who did this and punish them&quot;  Well, if everyone is saying that, then we have no one to punish.  Good luck playing 'fair rules' with these low lifes and getting answers.  The only way to get answers out of these trash' is to threaten them.  Well, since we can't do that(and they know we can't) We might get some sort of nuclear explosion in our country(whether nuclear fallout from a facility, some homemade dirty bomb or an Old timer WW I version.  Obviously, the only reasonably-possible scenario is a dirty nuke which can still kill tens of thousands of people.  The closer we get to these psychos, the more ugent their attacks will become.  IMO, they will attack again, and more than once.  They will always be looking for government targets, commercial targets and energy targets.  They are not reckless and they are not stupid.  They will do their best to hit us very hard next time.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/urittdabard.showPublicProfile?language=EN>rittdabard</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 49<br> <font color=#E9D756>(3/14/02 6:57:47 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=286.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Has Shrub lost his Fvcking mind?!</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.unicef.org/newsline/99pr29.htm">www.unicef.org/newsline/99pr29.htm</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br><br>That is why the Iraqi's hate us. Bushie's poppa talked them into standing up to Saddam and we left them to get steam rolled by an angry Republic Guard. We then hacve the balls to laugh at these people's for how easily they buckled under the largest ariel assault ever on the planet. Iraq does not want a war with us, they just don't want to show us that our bullying tactics aren't going to affect them. However if we do attack them, all parties expect Saddam to unleash all his bio and chem. weapons on Isreal, who will undoubtedly find a way to blame it on the Palestinians. Year one Bush upsets the Chinese whom we had closed gaps during Clinton's administration with results unseen since Nixon's ping pong diplomacy. Year two he helps the Isrealis piss away the camp David accords. In his blind ignorant lust to undo all of Billy's accomplishments do you think he is off to Ireland next year to stir @#%$ up amongst them?<br><br>However Lith has a point, we must strike first at the heart of terror, before it destroys our God created countries way of life. However, since Bush is ignorant, we all know his &quot;Axis of Evil&quot; is a joke. So I have made a list of the true enemies of the American way. I call this the Axis of really really bad, and I expect immediate nuclear strikes.<br><br>1. Florida... Juvenile Delinquents flying planes into buildings, Bay of pigs, every other year some angry cuban refugee tries attacking a boat, Elian, Janet Reno, the dismantling of world series champions, blacks not allowed to vote, hanging chads, butterfly ballots, third leading state in executions, swamp gas the skunk ape, boy bands, Marilyn Manson, retirees getting screwed on realestate deals, abortion clinic shootings, Jeb Bush, scarred manatees,Rosewood, Ted Bundy...face it if you here Florida in the news and it isn't about a college bowl game or a tropical storm its the sound of sanity becoming unhinged. <br><br>2. Texas...mothers drowning kids, Waco, hopped up nurses driving over homeless, cheerleader moms &amp; their hitmen, first in executions, John Rocker works there, coke abbusing pro widerecievers, cattle ranchers vs. Oprah, crazy Mavericks owner, numero uno in pollution, drunken presidential daughters, Secret Service bailing out aforementioned's boytoys, the state that gave us our first first lady to have committed vehicular manslaughter, Enron, rodeos, crazy under-educated religious fundamentalists starting wars for oil, <br>Arid land, people known for traveling by four legged beast, oil, religious fantics, abuse of capital punishment, natives who are recognizable by what they wear on their head, lots of little brown people who spew forth jabberwockey like &quot;please don't shoot me&quot; face  it this place is the middle east in our backyard<br><br>3. Montana...this is kind of my North Korea on the list, sure their offenses aren't as much but they are a scary people who seem like loners compared to the rest of us urbanites. Between the Unabomber and Randy Weaver, though I think they deserve a closer inspection than North Korea which was working on reunifying with the south. I say we need to burn every Montana shack before some crazy starts terrorizing us again.

You have to come up with weapons grade radioactive materials. As it stands now it is not easy to smuggle that @#%$ through the borders or to buy it in the United States. <br><br>I do not agree with the &quot;Strike first&quot; thesis. It is a very dangerous principle akin to &quot;Shoot first, ask questions later&quot;. Besides, what are we supposed to do? Stike each and every country in the world that has weapons (or the technology to produce) of mass destruction? @#%$, let's start with Great Britain then! GB has one of the most successful biological weapons programs in the world. Oh, wait! Have the French stopped pointing nukes at the US? India and Pakistan have rapidly increased their nuclear arsenals and India is well into a biological weapons program. So, fvck-an-a, let's saddle up and strike them all first!

He worked tirelessly towards a Wilsonian vision of world community were no one nation state is the "Police State", but a coalition of countries accomplish the task. You will find it takes greater strength to build a community than it does to be the Lone Ranger, whipping out a gun, and shooting the "bad guys" all day. But hey, that is the problem with most of us Americans. We prefer to bomb the @#%$ out of a country, then ask questions later. That is being weak. So don't chide Clinton as weak. Real problem solving involves vision, something Bush doesn't have. Just what the hell do you think we are going to do if we go to war with Iraq or North Korea? When the smoke clears and the dust settles, what are we going to do with these countries?<br><br>The people in those countries hate us already! What would we do with them after conquering their nation? Hmmm... seems pretty short sighted to just go off bombing the living s*hit out of people without a plan as to how to fix the problem.<br><br>Maybe the United States government needs to grow some REAL brass balls and allow these countries to govern themselves. I mean, deterence only works against countries, not terrorists. We will never rid the world of terrorism unless we have full cooperation of all the nation states. We will not obtain that sort of cooperation through Sabre rattling, threats, and use of force. <p>Lurikeen Mali'Kyre<BR>Necromancer <BR>Proud Member of <a href="http://magustytalus.tripod.com/">The Order of Magus Tytalus</a><BR><BR>"My eyes will pierce your soul, then I will take your life!"<br></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ubrutas222.showPublicProfile?language=EN>brutas222</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 228<br> <font color=#E9D756>(3/17/02 9:42:00 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=286.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Has Shrub lost his Fvcking mind?!</span><hr size=1> Quote: Maybe the United States government needs to grow some REAL brass balls and allow these countries to govern themselves. <br><br>I agree.  Our country is so stuck on the here and now that we forget these countries have a few THousand years of history.  We can get pretty damn arrogant.  But I always think we should retaliate 3-fold.  We should NEVER retaliate one for one like Israel Was doing.  But thats really a whole different story.  They will be fighting until they kill each other.  <br><br>Yep, we need to get the @#%$ out of there.  Stop needing their oil, stop buying the oil and get the hell out of there.  The best way to destroy a country is by letting it destroy itself.  Get the hell out of there.  If they can't bitch about us they will bitch about themselves and we all know they will be killing eachother instead of killing us.  <br><br>We need to stop Milking the 'Oil Cow' and start using the hydrofuel cell.  The American people are taking some nasty hits from other countries because of our greedy corporations and zionist influenced government.  We need to get the hell out of there and stop 'Donating' Billions of dollars a year to Israel who is a rich country by themselves.  <br><br>We get so damn involved in money issues that we forget about American culture.  The only thing Americans hear about is how everyone else in the world hates us.  The average American has no idea why.  Our corporate platic cultural disease is running rampant around the world and everyone thinks that is what the average American is like.  They think we all 'shoot up', fuk our neighbors, go on drive-by shootings as a family weekend activity, binge drink ourselves to sleep and everyother psycho-social growth inhibitor there is.  <br><br>I do think there is a way to be 'superpower' and world leader without policing so much as we do.(Of course we will have to a little)  IF IF IF we build a reputation that is based on dignityrather than immediate monetary gratification, we just might gain some respect from intellectuals around the world(You know, the people who tend to run the media and government).  Our government policies, while having many positive qualities, are easy targets from critics because we are not consistent.  Those same critics are the people who gain notoriety by confronting Big-Bad American values.  If you can imagine how sports rivalries work.  NO team stays number one for too long before some 100th ranked no-name team comes out of nowhere to beat the powerhouse.  All of a sudden, the no-name team is on the news and getting Blown by every hot girl in there city.  All because they won one little battle, or got some kind of reaction/recognition from the powerhouse.  Ughgh, its no different than sports.  <br><br>France is a perfect example.  Have you noticed that they tend to oppose everything we do except that which is inevitably accepted by the rest of Europe?  They're so lame.  <br><br>Anyway, the thing I am most pissed off about is the ZERO recognition of the real American.  Our business interests Kills our reputation and the values we hold dear.  <br><br>Its all part of the propaganda machine.<br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uecofreakrisingwood.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ecofreak Risingwood</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://207.168.207.222/images/ecofreak.jpg " BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 280<br> <font color=#E9D756>(3/17/02 11:51:16 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=286.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Has Shrub lost his Fvcking mind?!</span><hr size=1> Personally, I think it's a good idea that Bush is going after Saddam.

It has concerned me that we are [at least] presenting ourselves as too over-bearing. I thought some on the pros and some on the cons and this is my conclusion … First off, why are we waving our nukes around like a gun-slinging cowboy? I think it is mainly because we are so vulnerable. Everything from our nuclear power plants, our food and water supplies, airplanes, and even the good 'ol U.S. mail are easy targets….and we know it. &quot;If you attack us, we are going to kill you and everything you are fighting for&quot; seems to be the message and I don’t know if there is a better message to send then that. They do not like us mostly because of our beliefs and not necessarily because of our politics. Siding with Israel is enough in itself to give them cause….remember, this is a &quot;holy war&quot; and the Islamic religion is extremely hostile towards not only Christians but against everything that opposes Islam. If we forsake Israel, they will still have it out for us just and solely because of the lifestyles we live here in the U.S…this is the nature of the Islamic extremist.<br><br> Secondly, how do we get the crap back into the horse? We cant….at least not at this point. We are apart of their &quot;holy-war&quot; rather we like it or not. We can either fight and win, or do nothing and loose. We do not know why those freaks-of-nature flew our planes into our buildings. We can speculate and guess all day on the specifics of &quot;why they were hostile towards us&quot;, but that isn't going to get us anywhere. We must take it at face value and that is…. For whatever reason they have, they want to completely destroy us. In turn, we must be ready to completely destroy them in order to save ourselves. Agreed? You do not and you can not negotiate with this type of enemy.<br><br>Lastly… In our quest to achieve wealth and prosperity we have stepped on many toes. Undoubtedly we are guilty of unfair dealings. We have ignorantly got ourselves involved into things that we should not have. Those things need to be fixed…not only to save ourselves from the enemy, but to save ourselves from ourselves. I have started to hear the tones of sympathy for the Islamic extremist's cause and plight and it really pisses me off. I know that many do not wish to be involved in a religious war. Many may see this as Islam vs. Christianity and it may very well be, however, rather you be either or neither, they are at war with you. We as Americans are detestable to them regardless if we subscribe to a religion or not. This is the &quot;unity&quot; of the american people, baby….we are involved each and everyone.<br><br>We need to back out of many of our affairs worldwide. We have our big hungry nose stuck in everything and our semi-greedy hand in every pocket…. it must end. I personally detest &quot;globalization&quot;.. it will never work, it will never be fair and honest and we will loose many rights as we know them.

The difference being the fundamentalist of the other religions don't run countries. Tis a far better idea to disempower their fundamentalists than to empower them. They tell their people that they are their only hope because we are threatening their lives, well guess what we are. The people see this, and feel this so more people willing to die for Saddam. When the Jews were less threatening to the Palestenians terrorism was decreasing over there. Sure you had a few splinter groups, but the vast majority on either side were hoping for peace. Than Isreal elected a hard-line leader and everytime a Palestenian splinter group acted punishment was taken out on the masses. This did not decrease terrorism as he had promised, but increased it. <br><br>In Iraq, under both democratic and republican leadership, we gave our men orders to bomb power plants, because a pentagon debriefing told us that would ruin their water supply. Well now the populaces general water supply is @#%$. They see us as the ones who are fighting dirty. After the gulf war Saddam's domestic popularity was crap, he didn't even travel amongst his citizenry. He is beloved again by his people, because he paints us as the evil empire and we have shown no problem in stepping into the role he has laid out before them. If after the Gulf War we had went in and used our National Guard to build a few simple purification centers amongst the rebel groups perhaps he wouldn't be the good guy over their and us the bad guy. It's a wide misconception among Americans that we lead the World in foriegn aid. That stat is true to the extant that we spend the most on other countries, but the majority of it is military aid. We rank around near one of the Koreas (think South) when it comes to humanitarian aid. I know America has a hatred of welfare and love of guns, but perhaps providing basic needs to the 3rd world instead of bullets and bombs might help alleviate some of the unrest in the world.<br><br>I dunno just my take<br>Ritt <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/udadzee.showPublicProfile?language=EN>dadzee</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 14<br> <font color=#E9D756>(4/1/02 12:27:55 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=286.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Has Shrub lost his Fvcking mind?!</span><hr size=1> Asgro, I simply think, or is that I think simply ?

But please take for example just this last week's events in Iraq: <br><br><!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  The Times of India reports: &quot;Thousands of Iraqis marched in Baghdad Saturday denouncing Israel's 'savage attacks' against the Palestinians and calling on their president to 'hit Tel Aviv,' AFP correspondents reported.<br><br>'Palestine is Arab, down with Zionism,' 'Don't worry Arafat, with our blood we will redeem Palestine,' 'Beloved Saddam, hit Tel Aviv,' the demonstrators chanted. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br><br>These are not a few fundamentalists, this is a nation. Record shows that Arafat would leave a &quot;peace talks&quot; meeting only to return to these 'fundamentalists' in Palestine and call for violence against Israel. Where is this in the Zionistic (sp?) US media?  It's no where! Arafat is not a peace-loving man at all. And let us not forget for one moment that the PLO would love to see Israel vanish from the earth....but thanks in part to the US they cant make it happen.<br><br>How should Israel and the US respond to these &quot;splinter groups&quot;? How should we dis-empower them and remove them from the world especially when they have the support of their leader(s)? Perhaps I'm just too old fashion and see &quot;eye for an eye&quot; ,but not only has Arafat not done anything about the these groups in his land, but he has yet to go before his public and denounce it (if he has ive yet to read it).<br><br>Most Americans tend to favor the underdog. Most do not like physical confrontation. Israel is being seen as a big zealous bully with the US backing them... They are simply defending themselves as we are. It's almost like &quot;sympathy for the devil&quot; but I'm telling you these Islamic fundamentalists are grade &quot;A&quot; wacko zealots.<br><br>As far as having the National Guard go into Iraq and repair what damage we and Saddam did, that's just nuts. They ruined themselves and we helped. I would be outraged if our tax dollars went to &quot;re-build&quot; Iraq. And besides, they kicked out the U.N. weapons inspection team (neutral)...why would they let us in there?<br><br>I am beginning to see these events as a line in the sand. Pacifism is a great idea if it works at the peace table...but honestly.. most of time it does not. What ends wars, unfortunately, is bombs and blood.<br><br>As previously stated, I agree that we (the US) need to be less involved in all that we are. We need to tend to our own and to the poor 3rd world counties (but charity begins at home). However, we should defend those, in certain cases, which cannot defend themselves. If it wasn't for the US support to Israel, the surrounding Arabs nations would have already put mustard on every Jewish person over there and eaten em.
