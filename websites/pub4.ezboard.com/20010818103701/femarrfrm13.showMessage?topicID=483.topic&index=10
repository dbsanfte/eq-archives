Couple months back we tried hosting a pickup raid on Fear.  Well, not only did another guild show up about an hour before (who I will not mention as to not start any useless flaming), but one of them said that they were aware of our raid from the boards here and planned theirs anyway (after seeing ours).  So, after much debate on who should go up, the leaders decided to try a joint raid.  My god, that was the biggest pile of bodies I've ever seen hehe.  It went from a well organized pick up raid to complete and utter chaos.  Groups were made and had to be remade a couple times I think before we entered because of it all.  Though after some Shriners came and helped clean up the mess, those that stayed ended up having a good time and some good drops.  Too bad that wasn't until like 2 or 3 hours later <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :\ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":\"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Anyway, just wanted to point out that plane ks'ing does happen <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

It's not fun when it happens because you were planning one thing, and for someone to jump your plans is very rude.  <br>
<br>
You do make a good point about the VS rotation.  If a pick up got into the rotatation, they would have to remain in the rotation -- it's not a one time thing.  We all know that it is very difficult for a pick up raid to begin on time and with the type of organization you get from the guilds that are on the rotation.  If a pick up raid is going to KS VS, and I'll even go so far as to say they're successful at doing so, they (i.e. the raid leader of the pick up raid) will have to commit to being in the rotation and taking down the mob, just like the guilds that are in it already.  Personally, I don't see that happening.  Yes, whacking VS once or twice would be fun, but the people on that rotatation are there because they can do it on a regular, consistent basis.   <p>Tormentcia

Lets say the whole raid gets wiped by VS .. who is going to be there to save you if you can't get back?  Most likely, the guild you want to KS.  No one on pick up raids likes it when their plans get jumped by someone who saw the plans on the board or even by someone who didn't .. at what point can anyone complain that they are mad for being jumped on a Plane, and then turn around and do it on the rotation for VS?  Seems like a double standard to me.   <p>Tormentcia

However, I have to agree with Darmu on the KSing issue.  If VS pops, and someone can get there first with a pickup group and take him down, there is nothing wrong with that.  The root of the DG/PC dispute was *not* that DG KSed PC, but rather that DG was already part of the rotation and was going out of turn.<br>
<br>
It would be considered good manners to tell the guild that is next in the rotation that you plan to go for VS.  But you certainly don't have to have their permission.<br>
<br>
It is a very different matter to say that a pickup group would be added to the rotation if it managed to kill VS.  Who would you say is in the rotation?  A pickup group?  40 players assembled by Darmu using a message board and in-game tells?  Darmu himself?<br>
<br>
Sooner or later, someone is going to take down VS with a pickup group.  It will be interesting to see how things work out. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uparum.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Parum</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 281<br> <font color=#E9D756>(7/29/01 8:52:51 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: how many people are interested in a VS pick up?</span><hr size=1> Tormentia - The reason people got mad at DG was because they were *already* in the rotation and were not up to kill him, yet did anyways.

Pick up raids simply are not as organized as the large guilds that can quickly get people together.  If a pick up manages to do it once, great.  However, who is going to keep that spot?  To the people in the rotation, they're not doing it with the intention of just doing it once .. they're earning their spot on a regular rotation.  I can already hear the bitching when the pick up raid gets KS'd .. it'll be the same bitching we hear when someone else is on a Plane.   <p>Tormentcia

<br>
In addition to pickup groups, there are several up-and-coming guilds that are eyeing VS.  Before long, the rotation is going to be so large that it may just collapse.  The one thing that may save the rotation is that VS is no longer an &quot;uber level&quot; mob, and the top guilds really don't have a lot of need for him.  On the other hand, VS is necessary for the wizard epic quests, which is apparently what led to the DG/PC blowup.<br>
<br>
As for whether a pickup group would become part of the rotation, my bet is that it will depend a lot on who is leading the group.  Someone like Gorndax probably has the stature to claim a permanent spot.  Someone like Darmu would have a lot harder time getting recognized as part of the rotation. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uk1ssk1ng.showPublicProfile?language=EN>K1SSK1nG</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http--snootorama.homestead.com-files-emarr.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 358<br> <font color=#E9D756>(7/30/01 7:45:30 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.seanbaby.com/stupid/images/mrt11.jpg WIDTH=120 HEIGHT=100></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: how many people are interested in a VS pick up?</span><hr size=1> Someone like Darmu would have a lot harder time getting recognized as part of the rotation. <br>

we'll see.<br>
<br>
anyway, about the &quot;keeping the spot on the rotation&quot;...who said we wanted to keep our spot? hell, we have 24 hours to gather to take VS down again, and if we don't get it in those 24 hours, big whoop...we'll do it again sometime.<br>
<br>
Also, i noticed torm said that VS isn't meant for pick up groups...why the hell not? why can't everyone have a shot at something? who the hell are you, being able to say that?

Though technically we can wait to &quot;resurrect&quot; the Remains of VS to get our epic pieces...The only thing the &quot;resurrected&quot; VS drops are 2 of the glowing stones for the druid epic.<br>
<br>
Personally, I think its a great idea to get a pick-up organized to take him out. I know that most of you believe the current rotation policy shouldn't be disturbed, but why should mobs such as VS be held above those that are not in large guilds?  Why should we not be able to win a Diamond Encrusted Staff (for example) on a random? Rather than having to pay outrageous amounts to someone else just because you aren't in &quot;the rotation&quot;?  I mean each of those larger guilds gets a chance at him every week. What would the big deal be with waiting one more week while some of the &quot;smaller&quot; guys give it a shot?<br>
<br>
Do I think it should be done first without asking? No, that would be rude.  However their own policy is you have to rough arm your way into the rotation in the first place. I do believe that if you are willing to create a pick-up raid to take VS out, you should also plan on staying in the rotation that you just rough armed your way into.  Doing anything else would just make you look plan silly &amp; would most likely discourage the rotation allowing another pick-up raid anytime soon.<br>
<br>
Though I know I can't assume what these guilds would say to a pick-up raid request, I would hope that they remember the time they weren't in a large guild and was in the same spot that most of the server is in.  My view point is of course skewed to the several hundred on EMarr that aren't in a large guild as I myself am in a smaller guild as well.<br>
<br>
Just my 2cp.

<br>
Point is, I'm guildless; have no intention of joining one of the guilds that is on the rotation.  So, for right now at least, my chances of doing that part of my epic is somewhere between slim and none.  My only chance might be with a pick-up.  <br>
<br>
I would like to think that the uber guilds would accept the fact that someone is trying to complete part of their epic (especially if their only reason to be there is just to VS because it's their turn), they would be kind enough to either skip their turn on the rotation, or let some of us in on their &quot;guild&quot; raid.  Am I hoping for too much?  Probably.<br>
<br>
Is it possible that eventually, the rotation to VS would become boring and there would be more room for us &quot;non-ubers&quot;?  Bleh.  Never happen, I guess.  More wishful thinking on my part.<br>

This whole idea started for those of us that are getting up there in our levels and are happy with our small, close-knit guilds and will most likely never join up with a large guild that has VS on a rotation.  Why should we not be allowed a crack at him and the items he drops? Why should we be expected to pay and/or trade two arms and a leg for an item that might drop if we got in there. <br>
<br>
If we fail, we fail. If we win, then that means a couple people on that pick-up raid will walk away very happy.  <br>

<br>
Can a pick up raid KS VS and get into the rotation? How does that work?<br>
<br>
Well, after quite the long battle it boiled down to... get together as VS is up, kill him before the other guild gets a chance. It's yours, no questions asked. And you can be in the rotation, doesn't matter if it is a pick up raid, you just can't get help from guilds that are *IN* the rotation.<br>
<br>
Now that may have just been BS, but hey, they all said it and agreed to it. So if they do get pissed, they can come to the rants and flames section and eat their words. <br>

<br>
  Pick up raid wants to take down VS?  Beat us (the rotation guild there) and there will be no problems.  Do it several times in a row?  &lt;shrug&gt;  your call.<br>
<br>
  We'd prefer it that you'd join the rotation if you want to make it a regular event, because it's fairer to everyone.<br>
<br>
  But if you can beat one of us to the spawn you have as much right to try to take it down without interference as any other guild.<br>

The recent addition of VS's Remains only makes it easier for those of us that are not in a large enough guild to take him out.  VS himself still drops the Pulsing Green Stone, however not on a regular basis. <p>Ever in service of Clan Battle Axe,<BR>
