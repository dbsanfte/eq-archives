<br>
Yes Boodikka &amp; Chysimar, the behavior these people displayed was terrible and should not go unnoticed. Several others listened and responded to a quick tell asking for some respect for your wedding, but these jerks just couldn't get a clue. Really made me sick and I know the feeling was shared, and well noted, by all in attendance.<br>
<br>
This is perhaps not the type of offense that would normally be found in an SList posting, however these peopled showed such a blatant disregard for other peoples feelings and right to &quot;play&quot; I'd say they are prime candidates for future offenses. They actively and purposely spent well over 45 minutes doing the best they could to ruin a significant occassion and thus impeded the days enjoyment for close to 30 other players. Based on that I figure they are as deserving to be here as any other habitual KS'r, Ninja Looter, Thief and the like. The game is not all about Loot and XP it's about having fun and not doing so at others expense.<br>
<br>
I personally do not strike revenge on PCs but I trust these miscreants will not soon forget the error in their ways. <br>

  I am sorry to hear about your wedding. But to add to this topic in a new dimension. Earic was pulling from the middle of the Orc Camp in Highpass Hold. Our group was diligent about responding to camp checks and when it first happened, we let him know it was camped and aasked him to move on or at least stop pulling. Eventually we had to compete with him for the kill on each pop. Fortunately our group was doing way mor damage than one Druid, but it is frustrating to have one player be so disruptive. He even attacked Orcs that were already aggored on one of our group members. Finally insulted us on shout channel. This was on Aug-2-2001, so he is not banned and is a menace to honest players everywhere.<br>

He decided he would pull for the group, even though we had 3 tanks and when he dinged I figured out why he kept em coming even though most of us were down below half health.  He then agroed 3 warriors, zoned to save his ass and then logged without disbanding or saying he was doing so.  <br>

About 1 month ago i was in a group that was camping dervs in WC.  We didn't have a healer and when we saw a druid shouting for a group we picked him up.  Well right when he joined we said, &quot;you are the only healer, don't melee, just heal and med.&quot;<br>
anyway, all he could think about was trying to charm a bear so that he could have a pet. he didn't heal any of us ever, and basically didn't assist in ANY of the kills, just ran around trying to charm bears.<br>
<br>
i had been sending tells to the leader (sorry i don't remember her name) for various reasons. and in one of them i said, will you please kick earic out.  she wanted to but didn't want to do it with the others permission, so i sent a tell to 1 and she to the other it was a 4-0 vote to kick him out, once he left we all celebrated and found a real druid that knew what he was doing.  just wanting to add my rant to this list.<br>

Not sure what level exactly. Ran into him in HHK also. Wasn't healing unless yelled at. Constantly looting instead of medding. <br>
<br>
He complained of being OOM (Even with a bard mana song AND my breeze going) and we wondered if he was OOM why wasn't he medding? Finaly I had to throw up multiple runes on our tank when he dropped to almost below 10% health to keep him alive long enough for the Paladin to expend her Lay on Hands to heal him. <br>
<br>
Earic's response to her doing that was a wisecrack comment on if the paladin could heal like that why did we keep bothering him for heals. At which point the paladin disbanded him and invited the next person on the list. He proceeded to apologize and beg. <br>
<br>
Worst healer I've ever seen. Totaly unreliable. And I thought his name looked familiar. Then I spotted this here. When I get to HHK tonight I'll be sure to let the Paladin and Dwarf know that this is here and to avoid him in the future. <p>Evryl <br>

I was GL a few nights ago, he asked to be on the list, and 3 people in my group said FUCK NO and would leave if he were invited in, so I kept him off the list and said it was the will of the group. Two days later, he and Winluan were taking my guard room spawns from the lookout room, Winluan making a total ass out of himself and Earic just being quiet. Eventually they left, Earic started a group down in the warrior room. Trained me and my group 4-6 times or so.  <br>
<br>
Seems a member of my group (borlaor maybe?) gave an interesting story about Earic. Seems his sister/girlfriend/something (borlaors not earics) died, respawned in Qeynos, and asked Earic for a SoW for a corpse run.  Earic responded by asking for a Breeze. The enchanter (level 14 or so) said she didn't have that spell yet. Earic then denied her a SoW.  This to me, is incredibly rude, and seems like exactly the thing this type of person would do.<br>

<br>
About two weeks ago, I was on my monk twink in HHP hunting gnolls with my healing partner. We were soloing the gnoll ledge with just the two of us. Next thing we know, this druid in all black gnome skin comes up and starts to take the camp.<br>
<br>
We tried to tell him that we had it camped.. we had been camping it for the last hour. It did no good at all. He kept trying to take spawn as fast as he could which meant I had to compete for damage. With the help of my healing druid partner, he only manage to take two kills from us.<br>
<br>
He kept saying &quot;I just wanna ding.. &quot; No excuse. We had the camp, we were holding the camp. He begged us to invite him. When we said no, he got verbally hostile and stepped up his efforts to KS us.<br>
<br>
What was funny.. is the whole zone knew of him. The orc group kept calling for one more to join them. There shouts and ooc's were like this &quot;One more needed for orc group! All welcome unless your name is Earic&quot;.<br>
<br>
I had been warned of Earic earlier today by a higher lvl druid friend. Seems that he was begging high lvl druids to PL him for pay, then not paying them.<br>
<br>
Earic was lvl 18 at the time.. but imagine this.. he was lvl 18 and he had a surname. Kinda makes you wonder who he torqued off to loose two levels.  <p><br>

<br>
Tho i have no bad run ins with Earic, he bound me last night in High Pass, and was complaing to me how &quot;everyone hated him&quot; and how &quot;his group booted him when he went ask&quot;.<br>
<br>
When he spoke to me his grammar was rather crude, runons and such(and he was whiney), and this coupled with &quot;his dad said i could spend the money&quot; makes me suspect that hes very young *shrug* I half want to cut him some slack, but He is what i fear most on the higher end game... a player who dosnt know how to play.<br>
