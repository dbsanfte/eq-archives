The Riptide goblins have adopted a new king but are still in a vulnerable state until his subjects accept his rule. The Plasmatic Priesthood is aware of the weakened state of the Riptides and has convinced the Fire Peak goblins to strike against them. Although I do not agree with the mannerisms or actions of any goblin clan, such a war would be detrimental to all who are caught in its path. Lord Gimblox of the Fire Peak clan has been meeting with a member of the Plasmatic Priesthood in the Temple of Solusek Ro. Locate the Plasmatic Priest, hand him this statue to hinder his powers, then eliminate him and bring me his robe. <br>

However, there is yet another threat rising from the Plasmatic Priesthood that may have dire effects on all of Norrath if it is not stopped. An Iksar member of the Triumvirate missionaries has discovered that the Plasmatic Priesthood has somehow convinced the sarnak summoners of Chardok to assist them in summoning Ixiblat Fer to Norrath. Take this shell to Naxot Deepwater in the Burning Woods so that she knows I have sent you. We ask that you return with the Sceptre of Ixiblat Fer as well as evidence to show that the Plasmatic Priesthood is dealing with the sarnaks. High Priest Omat will await your return.

The fact that the Plasmatic Priesthood has mustered up the power to summon such a being means drastic actions must be taken to stop the fanatic cult of Fennin Ro. I wonder what kind of favor Zordak Ragefire performed for the sarnak summoners to convince them to assist in the ritual that brought forth Ixiblat Fer. The dragon Iksar hybrid abominations are not beings who ally with others easily. All I have seen in my divinations of the High Plasmatic Priest are riddles, and signs that the one who slays him may be awarded an Orb of the Triumvirate. If you are the one whom my visions foretell, then seek Zordak Ragefire and bring me his heart. <br>

Priestess Naxot sacrificed herself selflessly so that others may be spared the horrors Ixiblat would have brought to Norrath. May the waters of Norrath forever remember her reflection. I thank you for delivering Naxot's message to me and give you this pearl imbued with the power of the Triumvirate. Should you find Zordak Ragefire, speak with him before all else and hand him this pearl. No mortal enemy of the Triumvirate can resist its enchantments.' <br>

WOW! Talk about Call to arms. Thank you to The Chosen Clan aand Dark Trinity for the a majority of the Fire Power, and the fact that they pretty much worked togeather for a common goal. That was very cool. Thank you to my Guild also, the Chosen Counsel, alot of really great people in there. Special Thank you to Kaldaraa for informing me when he Popped, and, an Honerable mention to Vormax for going to bed, cuz the spawn would have been his. Vormax, when he pops again, and you need help, send me a tell, and I will grab some of my friends, and be more than happy to help you. Thank you Celina, for reminding me about 20 times not to give the pearl to some ones pet. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>

[Sun Jun 10 23:32:10 2001] You say, 'Hail Zordak Ragefire'<br>
[Sun Jun 10 23:32:10 2001] Zordak Ragefire stares at Worthy  with unblinking eyes. A wide grin crosses Zordak's face and flames flicker in the depths of his eyes. 'Welcome to the new fortress of the Plasmatic Priesthood! It's a shame about Lord Nagafen's untimely death, really it is! Such a powerful and noble creature should not perish at the hands of mortals.'<br>
<br>
Here is where I gave him the Pearl:<br>
 <br>
[Sun Jun 10 23:32:14 2001] Zordak Ragefire laughs maniacally as he crushes the pearl in his hands with inhuman strength. 'The Triumvirate missionaries think their petty magic can affect me!!  I will send your heads to Omak as a symbol of what is to come for all of his missionaries!' <br>
[Sun Jun 10 23:32:14 2001] You gain party experience!!<br>

<br>
Blazing Greaves and Blazing Boots Dropped. Couple chunks of Dragon Meat, and also a Red Dragon Scale.<br>
<br>
Turning in everything to get my Rez Stick:<br>
<br>
First, the Heart.<br>
<br>
[Sat Jun 16 01:53:20 2001] Omat Vastsea says 'I see now that Zordak Ragefire and the exiled elder dragon Zordakalicus were the same being. That explains how he resisted our attempts to divine his affairs and past. Each of these orbs I have granted you represents one of the Triumvirate. Jhassad Oceanson awaits on the shore below to perform the ritual that will merge the orbs into a single Orb of the Triumvirate and summon an avatar from the Plane of Water. Present the Orb of the Triumvirate to the Avatar of Water when it arrives and allow your destiny to be unraveled. <br>
<br>
I had to run down to the Beach to go find the guy, and here is what happened!<br>
<br>
[Sat Jun 16 01:55:39 2001] Jhassad Oceanson kneels in the sand and places the three orbs into a large abalone shell bowl. A blue glow surrounds his hands as he waves them over the orbs resting in the bowl. The orbs crack and fall apart, releasing their contents, then reform into a single glowing orb. Jhassad Oceanson gently removes the Orb of the Triumvirate and places it in Worthy 's hands.  'The Avatar of Water approaches. You must hand him the Orb of the Triumvirate and it will be decided if it is your destiny to wield the Nem Ankh Sprinkler.' <br>
<br>
I then turned it into the Avitar of Water, and got my Rez Stick! WHOOT!<br>
<br>
I just want to thank every one who helped and supported me throughout my quest. Thank you all very much!<br>
