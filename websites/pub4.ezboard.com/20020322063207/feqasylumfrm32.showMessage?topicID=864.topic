She reduced altitiude and spotted a man below. She descended a bit more and shouted, &quot;Excuse me, can you help me? I promised a friend I would meet him an hour ago, but I don't know where I am.&quot;<br>
<br>
The man below replied, &quot;You are in a hot air balloon hovering approximately 30 feet above the ground. You are between 40 and 41 degrees north latitiude and between 59 and 60 degrees west longitude.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You must be an engineer, &quot; said the balloonist.<br>
<br>
&quot;I am,&quot; replied the man, &quot;How did you know?&quot;<br>
&quot;Well,&quot; answered the balloonist, &quot;everthing you told me is, technically correct, but I have no idea what to make of your information, and the fact is I am still lost. Frankly, you've not been much help so far.&quot;<br>
<br>
The man below responded, &quot;You must be in Management.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I am,&quot; replied the balloonist, &quot;but how did you know?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well,&quot; said the man, &quot;you don't know where you are or where you are going. You have risen to where you are due to a large quantity of hot air. You made a promise which you have no idea how to keep, and you expect people beneath you to solve your problems. The fact is you are in exactly the same position you were in before we met, but now, somehow, it's my fault.&quot; <br>

The Smiths were unable to conceive children, and decided to use a surrogate father to start their family. On the day the proxy father was to arrive Mr Smith kissed his wife, and set off for work, saying the man should arrive soon.<br>
Half an hour later, by chance, a door-to-door baby photographer rang the doorbell, hoping to make a sale.<br>
&quot;Good morning madam, I've come to.......&quot;<br>
&quot;Oh, no need to explain. I've been expecting you, &quot; Mrs Smith cut in. &quot;Really?&quot; the photographer asked. &quot;Well good, I've made a speciality of babies.&quot; &quot;That's what my husband and I had hoped. Please come in and have a seat.&quot;<br>
After a moment she asked blushing, &quot;Where do we start?&quot; &quot;Leave everyting to me. I usually try two in the bathtub, one on the couch, and perhaps a couple on the bed. Sometimes the living room floor is fun too.....you can really spread out.&quot;<br>
&quot;Bathtub, living room floor? No wonder it didn't work for Harry and me.&quot;<br>
&quot;Well madam, none of us can guarantee a good one every time. But if we try several different positions, and I shoot from six or seven angles, I'm sure you will be pleased with the result.&quot;<br>
My. my, that's a lot of.....&quot; gasped Mrs Smith.<br>
&quot;Madam, in my line of work, a man must take his time. I'd love to be in and out in five minutes, but you'd be disappointed with that I'm sure.&quot;<br>
&quot;Don't I know it&quot; Mrs Smith said quietly. <br>
The photographer opened his briefcase and pulled out a portfolio of his baby pictures.<br>
&quot;This one was done on the top of a bus.&quot; &quot;Oh, my God,&quot; Mrs Smith exclaimed, tugging at her handkerchief. &quot;And these twins turned out exceptionally well, when you consider the mother was so difficult to work with.&quot; &quot;She was difficult?&quot; &quot;Yes, I'm afraid so. I finally had to take her to the park to get the job done right. People were crowding round four and five deep to get a good look.&quot; &quot;Four and five deep?&quot; asked Mrs Smith, eyes widening in amazement. &quot;Yes, and for more than three hours too. The mother was constantly squealing and yelling.......I could hardly concentrate. The darkness approached and I began to rush my shots. Finally when the squirrels began nibbling at my equipment I just packed it all in.&quot;<br>
Mrs Smith leaned forward. &quot;You mean they actually chewed on your um...equipment?&quot;<br>
&quot;That's right. Well, madam, if your ready, I'll set up my tripod so that we can get to work.&quot;<br>
&quot;Tripod?&quot;<br>
&quot;Yes, I have to use a tripod to rest my Cannon on. It's much too big for me to hold for very long.&quot;<br>
&quot;Madam? Madam? .........Good Lord she's fainted.&quot;<br>

&gt;Fresh from her shower, a woman stands in front of the mirror<br>
complaining to<br>
&gt;her husband that her breasts are too small.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;Instead of characteristically telling her it's not so, the husband<br>
&gt;uncharacteristically comes up with a suggestion.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;&quot;If you want your breasts to grow, then every day take a piece of<br>
toilet<br>
&gt;paper and rub it between your breasts for a few seconds&quot;.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;Willing to try anything, the wife fetches a piece of toilet paper and<br>
&gt;stands<br>
&gt;in front of the mirror, rubbing it between her breasts.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;&quot;How long will this take?&quot; she asks.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;&quot;They'll grow larger over a period of years,&quot; he replies.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;The wife stops. &quot;Why do you think rubbing a piece of toilet paper<br>
between<br>
&gt;my<br>
&gt;breasts every day will make my breasts grow over the years?&quot;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;&quot;Well it Worked for your arse, didn't it?&quot; <br>

A blonde wanting to earn some money decided to hire herself out as a &quot;handy-woman,&quot; and started canvassing a nearby well-to-do neighborhood. She went to the front door of the first house and asked the owner if he had any odd jobs for her to do. &quot;Well, you can paint my porch,&quot; he said.<br>
&quot;How much will you charge me?&quot; The blonde, after looking about, responded, &quot;How about $50.00?&quot; The man agreed and told her that the paint and other material that she might need were in the garage.<br>
The man's wife, inside the house, heard the conversation and said to her husband, &quot;Does she realize that the porch goes all the way around the house?&quot; The man replied, &quot;She should, she was standing on it. Do you think she's dumb?&quot;<br>
A short time later the blonde came to the door to collect her money. &quot;Your finished already?&quot; the husband asked.<br>
&quot;Yes,&quot; the blonde replied, &quot;and I had paint left over so I gave it two coats.&quot;<br>
Impressed the man reached into his pocket for the $50.00<br>
&quot;And by the way,&quot; the blonde added, &quot;it's not a Porch, it's a Lexus <br>

Mahatma Gandhi, as you know, walked barefoot most of the<br>
time, which produced an impressive set of calluses on his<br>
feet. He also ate very little, which made him rather frail<br>
and with his odd diet, he suffered from bad breath. This<br>
made him ....what? A super callused fragile mystic hexed by halitosis.<br>

A woman has twins and gives them up for adoption. One<br>
of them goes to a family in Egypt and is named &quot;Ahmal.&quot;<br>
The other goes to a family in Spain; they name him &quot;Juan.&quot;<br>
Years later, Juan sends a picture of himself to his birth<br>
mother. Upon receiving the picture, she tells her husband<br>
that she wishes she also had a picture of Ahmal. Her husband<br>
responds,<br>
&quot;They're twins! If you've seen Juan, you've seen Ahmal.&quot;<br>

A three-legged dog walks into a saloon in the Old<br>
West. He slides up to the bar and announces: &quot;I'm<br>
looking for the man who shot my paw.&quot;<br>

A woman takes a lover during the day while her husband is at work. Her 9 year old son comes home unexpectedly, sees them and hides in the closet to watch.<br>
The woman's husband also comes home unexpectedly. She puts her lover in the closet not realizing that the little boy is in there already.<br>
<br>
The little boys says, &quot;Dark in here.&quot;<br>
The man says, &quot;Yes it is.&quot;<br>
Boy- &quot;I have a baseball.&quot;<br>
Man- &quot;That's nice.&quot;<br>
boy- &quot;Want to buy it?&quot;<br>
Man- &quot;No, thanks.&quot;<br>
boy- &quot;My dad's outside.&quot;<br>
Man- &quot;OK, how much?&quot;<br>
Boy- &quot;$250.00.&quot;<br>
<br>
In the next few weeks, it happens again that the boy and the lover are in the closet together.<br>
Boy- &quot;Dark in here.&quot;<br>
Man- &quot;Yes it is.&quot;<br>
Boy- &quot;I have a baseball glove.&quot;<br>
The lover remembering the last time, asks the boy, &quot;How much?&quot;<br>
Boy- &quot;$750.00.&quot;<br>
Man- &quot;Fine.&quot;<br>
<br>
A few days later, the father says to the boy, &quot;Grab your glove, let's go outside and let's have a game of catch.&quot;<br>
The boy says, &quot;I can't, I sold my baseball and my glove.&quot;<br>
The father ask, &quot;How much did you sell them for?&quot; <br>
Boy- &quot;$1,000.00&quot;<br>
<br>
The father says, &quot;That's terrible to overcharge your friends like that... that is way more than those two things cost. I'm going to take you to church and make you go to confession.&quot;<br>
<br>
They go to the church and the father makes the little boy sit in the confessional booth and he closes the door.<br>
<br>
The boy says, &quot;Dark in here.&quot;<br>
The priest says, &quot;Don't start that crap again <br>

The transient pleasures of a vision seem, 
and yet we think the greatest pain's to die.

his rugged path; nor dare he view alone,
