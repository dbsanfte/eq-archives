<br>
One of the rules I gave before we made our trip to Chardok was about epic drops. &nbsp;<b>I was leaving the looting rights to each particular drop up to the members of the class that needed it.</b> &nbsp;Whim, Lecudian, and I all opted to do a full random (I asked Bridgecrusher to do the roll for me - congratulations to Lecudian on the Prince's head!). &nbsp;The clerics were debating for a few minutes about how to handle the Overking's scroll drop. &nbsp;Bekki sent me a tell that they were considering giving Sinangel the first drop by default if she was present (she had an emergency guild CR to attend and said she would return immediately). &nbsp;If Sinangel wasn't present, or if a 2nd scroll dropped during the raid, it was to be randomed between Bekki and Darikan (who was making the trip to us). &nbsp;Bekki was apparently double and triple checking with the other clerics to make sure they were satisfied with the arrangement, since I got a couple of clerics (sorry, can't remember which) telling me, "We said it was fine. &nbsp;No need to keep asking!"<br>
<br>
When the Overking died, I mentioned that the clerics had already agreed to give the scroll to Sinangel. &nbsp;Darikan was the only one who spoke up against this, but the scroll had already been looted. &nbsp;I was under the impression that all the clerics had agreed to this, and so were others (including non-clerics), as I received several tells from people assuring me that it wasn't my fault if a huge argument came of it.<br>
<br>
Around this time, I was starting to nod off a little. &nbsp;I told BC if the raid was going to continue much longer, that I would pass on the drops I was still holding for someone else to random off. &nbsp;He asked me to stick around for another 30 minutes, so I agreed. &nbsp;About 10-15 minutes later, the Queen was trained to us and we were wiped out. &nbsp;I'm bound up in the Plane of Mischief, so they couldn't summon my corpse with everyone else's right away. &nbsp;I fell asleep while waiting around (there weren't any porters around to get me out, and I didn't know the location to the exit), and didn't actually get back my corpse until around 5am (thanks to Celoria, Fyreflight, and Brodek!).<br>
<br>
Because of the situation with my bindpoint and no easy way to my corpse, I didn't know if anything more was being said about the cleric drop. &nbsp;If Darikan hadn't agreed to that setup, then I feel bad about it... &nbsp;I was <i>sure</i> all the clerics had given the OK prior to breaking in.<br>
<br>
I still have a few minor drops that belong to that raid, so I'll find Bridgecrusher in the game so we can random them off to everyone who was there. &nbsp;From what I can remember, it's just a couple of VP key quest staves, a few gems, a few spells, and that (non-epic) scroll from the prince that dropped off the king. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uparumnsilarik.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Parum n Silarik</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 38<br> <font color=#E9D756>(10/28/01 11:20:53 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I Got Bent Over in Chardok(Read this One)</span><hr size=1> First of all, i'd like to apologize to all involved about my bitchyness.

<br>
Now, I pretty much did have my head in my ass, and just about take full responsibility for my posts.  I know this doens't make them right, but I can at least admit i was mostly wrong.<br>
<br>
One thing that I would recomend, Darikan (and this is not an attack, just a wise word of wisdom), is making absolutely, one hundred percent sure that whoever is doing loot (was it Vishanti? or Koarl?) knows well in advance of any changes agreed upon by you and whoever involved.  I dont know what these changes could have been, nor could I know how you explained them, to whom, or to what extent, just that there was confusion.<br>
<br>
I will not debate any of above posts about me, first of all because I dont like bitch fests, but also because I pretty much brought them on myself, and this will be the last time I make note of it.<br>

again, me = jackass, as many people have known for a long time.<br>

<br>
Darikon save your &quot;poor me&quot;, I sent tells to &quot;all&quot; clerics, that we would be deferring to Sinangel and clerics who were up next, would &quot;roll&quot;.  Yes, this apparently will turn into a &quot;he said/she said&quot;, but i got the &quot;ok&quot; from ALL. Simply said. <br>
<br>
Sinangel, our 59th cleric, (who did a great job, during raid btw) is not at fault, because she had the go ahead from the clerics (except for the change of mind, evidently, of our 12 year old).  This was communicated to BC (who had asked us to handle it) and Vish... and the clerics!<br>
<br>
Apparently, this is all about you Darikon, geez never seen such a spoiled rotten child, well actually i have, got 2 <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  . What Darikon was told before the raid I have no control over.<br>
<br>
  But this was Gywenth's raid, and Sinangel was the highest cleric left and had been promised next scroll by Gywenth...so in the spirit of fairness and kindness and a raid that was originally attended by all but Darikon, I bowed out and deferred to Sinangel. <br>
<br>
Like Parum said, we were all trying to keep this thing going, I sent tells over and over trying to get this off dead center.  Yes, Darikon did come in with &quot;guns a blazing&quot; saying how this and that was going to happen. /rude ....<br>
<br>
===&gt;BUT, To say that Darikon didn't get at least one tell that said to the effect, &quot;Sinangel gets first scroll, the rest roll on 2nd&quot; is inconsistent with what I said from the beginning.  He could have left...he didn't  &lt;===<br>
<br>
BC, Vish, Korarlei, and most importantly, all the other clerics, you know i tried... that's all that matters to me <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
To say that Darikon was being used for his heals well then so was I, Celoria and Goodfellow.  So we've all been used :P  <br>
<br>
Funny, rather than feeling &quot;used&quot;. I was having a good time watching the good raid group, being with an excellent group, watching BC lead a masterful raid, in the absence of Gywenth's LD (sorry Gywenth), getting a little exp and learning the King/Queen route.  Sure I would have loved to have had the scroll, but you know what, it just doesn't matter THAT much.  <br>
<br>
Geez Darikon, I've got Video's of my kids throwing that kind of tantrum...here's your rattle and pacifier...go get some sleep <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
While I'm sure this will be &quot;flamed&quot;, argued and whatever else our dear child is prone to do... flame away...got more interesting stuff to do.  I've said my say and I'm done. /ignore<br>
<br>
Sinangel, /hugs and congrats. The only thing I'm sorry for in this, is if this has cast a pall on your good fortune. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
In any case, I can vouch for this:  I am in COM with Darikan, and he did ask in guild who wanted to go with him to do the Chardok King Raid.  He also said that it was to be NBG and that whoever clericwise was at that step got to be in on the randoms, and that they were going to attempt to do the King twice.  This was before you all left on the outting.<br>
<br>
A good fact for everyone to remember when going on a raid is that not everyone is honest, and not everyone is fair.  Why?  Some folks are a piece of shit IRL and use the game as a way to be greedy selfish lil ratbastards and don't give a damn about everyone around them.  They like to sit in their little room in their mommy and daddy's houses and play this game they don't pay for and think that the world belongs to them.  <br>
<br>
Darikan didn't do anything wrong in this one from what I both saw IG and here.  He got mad and upset, well its true he did, and rightfully so.  I've seen half the folks that posted here do that when they felt screwed.  But it does seem Darikan DID talk to the folks beforehand, and that things DID change. <br>
<br>
NOWHERE was it mentioned to the raid party before it started that Gywenth promised the first item to anyone.  If it was Darikan and the folks he brought wouldnt have gone.  So it does sound like some backstabbing bullshit was going on.  And I'm not saying it was any or all of Sinangel's doing because I don't know.  But I  DO know that for Bekki to get on here and scream at Darikan and insult him sure does point a finger at a probably guilty conspirator.    <br>
<br>
&lt;/tongue in cheek&gt;  Why of course Darikan, you pathetic little fuck, how DARE you point out on this board that things weren't right/fair/true!   Your being mad is just WHINING that you got fucked, and you should shut up and take it and not slander or smear the name of anyone who deserves it, like I'm going to try to do to you.   I don't have to argue your points, I can bury them in namecalling bullshit that I still use in homeroom in junior highschool where I can pretend people still like me.   &lt;/tongue in cheek OFF&gt;<br>
<br>
Yes, it does sound familiar, don't it?   I hope that alot of folks that like to fantasize that they are somoene big and special IRL can one day actually argue facts rather than just call names and deride folks for trying to work things out.  In the meantime, sit in your little trailer in your pile of filth, and play EQ, all the while remaining nothing more than an isecure selfish little nobody.  I'm sure that someday you might become a likable person on the other side of the keyboard.  Just not today or anytime soon.<br>

Since you're a big mommy and all, maybe you can explain to all us little kids how disagreements work. Did your high and mighty self ever receive a tell from Darikan saying that he agreed for the first scroll to go to Sin? Or did you just send him a tell, and assume he got it? Cause you know it is possible to send a tell and not have the person receive it. Maybe he was afk, or maybe there was battle spam, or maybe he was in that magical time between zoning where tells go through but the person never receives them because they are coming from half way across the map to help your friend get their epic. Or maybe you are just lying about telling Darikan the loot rules.<br>
<br>
I mean with all the tells you were handling, was it possible that he never received your tell and you never knew about it? Did you really think some stranger would bring himself and several of his friends to a raid, where something he needed would drop, but that he wasn't allowed to roll on? We are so happy that you enjoyed watching YOUR friend get their epic. But, would you have done the same if you were in Darikan's place? Would you have gone, knowing that some 59 cleric you don't know or care about was getting their epic piece without you even getting a shot about it? I'm sure you would have because you are the big, mature, responsible mommy type. Oops, it's my nap time now......gotta run.<br>

&quot;Finaly Korarlei has the gaul to say that my guild Champions of Marr is a shitty guild &quot;<br>
<br>
CoM has a few good people left, but the majority of members now may not know the same principles that it once had.  Other then that, any other comment about CoM from me will look like this &quot;.....&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;and that if I ever wanted to get my epic I needed to join him and Gorndax starting their own guild. &quot;<br>
<br>
Ever think it was a compliment? The old breed of raiders respected Gorndax and got many things accomplished with him.  Ever think Korar knew this and wanted you to finish epic? Maybe thought you were so good that he wanted you to join? I certainly never had a bad experience with you.<br>
<br>
&quot;Anyone who knows a champion knows we are kind people and a strong guild, so please don't talk about things you don't know anything about. &quot;<br>

Without him and his back-up how long would you think this would've been delayed? Is it not with his assitance that this raid commenced? God forbid he walks in on the ass end of a raid, not knowing whats going on and asks a few questions/makes a few suggestions. Remmber, it was taken seriously because when the mob dropped so did his chance at his epic.<br>

Sinangel had already been given looting rights on the first scroll that dropped. She was given those rights before we even killed Ixblat and before the actual Breakin into Chardok was even started. We the Clerics that were present for the slaying of Ixblat had all aggreed to this. We were asked about who should get if a second one dropped or if we killed the king again and we ALL every cleric that was present at the Ixblat raid agreed that Sinangel gets the first scroll and the second if applicable would be rolled between Bekki and the other Remaining Clerics that WERE Present during the entire raid, counting ixblat fer. You were not even there for ixblat  and didnt get there till we actualyl were starting to head into chardok. I didnt even care who got the scroll, yea would have been nice to get it but I was there to have fun. But to somewhat try to clear this up.... the first drop had been determained to go to sinangel by default before we ever even killed the first sarnak due to her lvl and the fact that the scroll was the only thing that she needed to finish her epic with the exeption of Rage. Just my 2cents... and we had a long discussion amoung the clerics that were present at the slaying of ixblat fer and it was 100% one way voting that Sin would get the first scroll. Sorry to be repetative but just how we did it. Was looked at several times to make sure and all agreed. Thanks <p>Goodfellow 52nd Vicar<br>
