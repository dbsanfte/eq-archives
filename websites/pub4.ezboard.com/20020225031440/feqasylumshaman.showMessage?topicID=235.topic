Cast torpor on self immediately before pulling some nasty critter.  The torpor regen keeps me healthy till I can get a root off, etc.  Same thing in HoT, cast Torpor on self right before attempting slows so that if/when I get summoned, it's not so rough on the cleric trying to keep me alive.<br><br>4) <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Self Save</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->: Tigir's insects is pretty much an awesome spell as well, but as soon as you slap a slow on several mobs at once, at least a few of them come over to pay their respects to ya.  For some reason I've been very good at channeling through half a dozen things beating on me, so I can see casting Torpor before or after slowing to stay alive until those beating on me have been mezzed or rooted.<br><br>5) <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Monk/Puller Heal</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->: Monk puller in a lot of situations is beat up and FD while raid party engages mob.

It snares you.<br>2) Dont topor melee unless you have to. Absolutely have to. It not only snares them, it also slows them.<br>3) Dont topor someone that you need to heal quickly. Topor doesnt add any HP for about 8 seconds.<br>4) Dont cast topor on someone thats not in your group. You will just waste 200 mana since it wont stick to anyone thats not in your group, but it will eat the mana anyways.<br>5) Dont use topor when fighting mobs that constantly dispell (ie. Dragons that AE dispell). <br><br>Topor is an awesome spell. When used at the right times. You can cana down to 2 bubs of health, and get it all back for 200 mana. Although going from oom to fm takes awhile, topor allows us to regen mana faster than any other class.<br><br>You can heal players inbetween fights almost with the mana efficiency of a cleric. The exception being tanks with trainloads of HP. Nothing beats a CH for them.<br><br>In a fight where the clerics are running out of mana, or where you are the group healer, topor can be used on melee in many cases. They might moan and groan about it, but it does heal 1200 HP over 24 seconds, and if thats what it takes to keep them alive, so be it. Especially with warriors that are approaching 5k HP. We just cant heal them effectively with chloroblast when they get low on HP.<br><br>Healing yourself incase a mob that does alot of damage summons you doesnt seem to help all that much. For a couple of reasons. First, if you have topored yourself, you are snared. You cannot backup, and you move very slowly forward. Which means that if you get summoned, you have hell getting away from the mob. And if they are doing that much dmg to you, topor isnt going to heal you fast enough to save you. 1200 HP heal over 24 seconds. In 4 spurts. So basically, four 300 HP heals over 24 seconds. Mobs hitting you for 300 doubles to quads are going to exceed topors total heal in a second or two.<br><br>As for tigirs, its so rare that I have yet to see it drop, and have yet to meet anyone with it. And while there have been times I wished I had it, those times have been very few and far between. If it has aggro anything like Tugurs does, every mob your AE hits with will jump your ass like there is no tomorrow, and that probably will equate to SHAMAN DOWN very quickly. AE root might have been nice to use with it. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br>One other thing I learned about topor the hard way. Aggro is generated just by casting it. Even if you duck out to interrupt the cast, you still get the aggro. There was a case in ToV where I cast it, and ducked out a bunch of times due to dispells landing at just the wrong time, and after a few of these, while having landed a single heal on anyone, and not yet having cast any spells on the mob, I suddenly got summoned and chewed up. So be careful when casting it in cases like that.<br><br>You will never catch me without topor loaded. But there are alot of limitations to the spell and when you should use it. And even more limitations on when you can use it. There are times when I wish we had just gotten Natures Touch like the druids did for an instant 1000 HP heal. But that eats 400 mana, so topor is over twice as efficent. For the increased efficiency, topor is a nice spell. <p><BR><b>Bigmeeno</b><BR>Barbarian Oracle<BR><i><a href="http://www.fallenlegacy.com">FallenLegacy</a> on Lanys T'Vyl<br></i></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ufarfall.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Farfall</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>w4nn4b3!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(1/17/02 12:25:24 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumshaman.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=235.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: gotta agree</span><hr size=1> Thanks for the post Big..

Aggro isn't as bad as turgurs, but it can be bad...I play a lot of ghetto groups and sometimes we bite off more than we can chew.  In the month or so that I've had tigirs, I have used it sooo many times I can't count.  We had a great group in sebilis the other night, but our chanter was lagging a tad and ghosted ahead of us on our way in to discos.... We got a 9 pull out of that, Tigirs slowed everything on first cast.  This pulled aggro off the poor beaten down chanter and onto me, which allowed the chanter to easily get off his casts and same for the cleric.<br>A couple of times its turned me into a martyr, taking the death.
