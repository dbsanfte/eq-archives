For 3 solid blows to his head area I almost got stabbed (yes he was pissed off) and his slow-to-assist friend was holding me. Another 2 buddies of theirs were inside Centrelink. <br>
<br>
[bold]Background:[/bold]<br>
Four years ago the chap borrowed $20 from moi and I also bought him a meal - on his word that he repay me in mere days. His wife had left him and he had no money to feed their child, his story to me went. <br>
<br>
Since that time he has always run the other way when we have raised the matter, of $20 owed, within a insult distance of say 100 feet from spitting distance of each other. He was being smart about it. As some would say, he was dissin' me and felt clever about it. I'd even visited his parents home, since I was behind on my rent and that was going to the Admin.Appeals Tribunal as an eviction matter. He had been inside my mother's house often enough years gone by when he'd take advantage of my older brother (who is schizophrenic) and spent his social security on grog and smokes. He would even bring his friends inside and pinch my mother's things. His 'father' flat out didn't know where he was, or when he would be home, never let me inside. Same answer every time. I tried getting his father on to the subject of raising the matter himself when he came across his son next time, so I could settle the matter expeditiously, but he had no enthusiasm. He was about my age and a neighbor.<br>
<br>
Today I see the drug abusin' wastrel at Centrelink, and hail him. He is busy, he says, can't I wait? I hand in a form at the counter and now he is gone, so I go outside. <br>
<br>
I spy him talking with a guy in a car down the street and I know I am going to argue with this tool, I am aware too that he will probably pull a knife, he has turned to a life of petty crime. I'd run a big risk that his drug 'friends' joined in as well. A bright spark lit up my idea: here we were at the Centrelink office doors, let's see if I can show this fool up. I call the fool over and ask for a cigarrette, he's got none, what about my $20? &quot;Can't you wait? I'm in the middle of something here.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I've waited years, @#%$.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;@#%$?, me @#%$?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;YEH @#%$.&quot; Push druggie. Push druggie again. Druggie attempts a push and something fitting for his reply, which eludes him. I shove druggie 3-4 feet using 2 hands, this time. He swings at me, I snap a right fist inches from his nose and right on target - his punches flew wild. I reach his neck with my left hand open: he is trying to close in so now he can't. I have socked him in the head now, he swings and I step it away, I sock him again and he executes a ' roundhouse kick', ambitious because he does not know how to deliver one properly. I turn and block his 'Sunday best' so it just slaps my back. We are scuffling. Out of principle I sock his head again, he is getting groggy. His friend sees he is losing bad so he grabs me. I may subsequently have elbowed his 'friend' a coupla times to the head but at this point my prime aquaintance produced a knife... He tried to stab me, came within inches of succeeding too; looked quite big for a pocket knife, dull grey blade, not very pointy hmmm. <br>
<br>
I stepped around it a bit, with his buddy meantime still hanging tough and trying to hold me. My aquaintance with the knife has bloody drool on his teeth, lips curled back in a ferocious snarl, and his face red and battered, the knife is upraised in a clenched hand: &quot;see this, you see this! this is what you are going to get blah blah. You think blah, well blah blah.&quot; <br>
<br>
That was the moment I triggered the sliding door sensors and stepped inside Centrelink, at least 30 people all with their eyes toward the door took in the scene of this druggie and his upraised knife just as death threats and the murder in his heart were the most plain. <br>
<br>
&quot;That guy tells me to wait after 4 years already, and he's tried to stab me because I've called him a @#%$ and punched him in the head 3-4 times when he swung at me first.&quot; say I.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hey, don't go baggin' my mate...&quot; says another druggie at the door. /Ignore druggies<br>
<br>
Centrelink staff take me inside to sit down and ascertain my health: have I been stabbed am I okay, do I want a coffee, A glass of water, do I need a doctor, would I like a ride home can they call anyone for me etc. etc.<br>
<br>
The police have been called, they get the guys description, and I get a ride home. They are looking for him now so they can get his statement.<br>

People like you are one of the reasons many people have a bad perception of visiting Centrelink.<br>
<br>
You want to push some morons buttons to get a reaction that involves the pulling of a knife you do it away from a place where mothers with children and the elderly gather.<br>

That other guy tried to get me on the ground, they couldn't do nothing to me in front of witnesses. I was happy to sock the guy once and leave it at that. It wasn't just about $20. He kept coming, I kept him at armslength. He tried to live up to his tough as @#%$ self image but fell short in the litmus test, I punched him. I hunched he was going to go for broke just to even out in front: he'd even kill somebody just to win an arguement over $20, that's how it goes, and I was right. Police are looking for a killer and his accomplice, robbing a 711 or something, their descriptions fit these two. Maybe I did more than just uncover his gutless heart, maybe I did people a favor and put the scent on a killer Victorian police are looking for even now. They sure as hell want him. They seemed happy with my story, most times I could be looking at a caution and possible charges myself. <br>
<br>
As I said, I had been inside Centrelink and I already knew who was around. I didn't shock anybody in there with a knife. It was the other guy's actions which frightened anyone, and that's his own call not mine. I chose not to get stabbed, and maybe killed, in front of everybody, which is a lot smarter and less traumatic for others, trust me. <br>
<br>
Most people here have seen the news: a lot of ppl are being knifed and killed in arguements with these guys at train stations and shops in similar situations. The guy is a crook, I know him, and he is using drugs and stealing anything he can to feed his habits. I know this. I know of him. I put the mark upon him and witnesses are going along with my call. As a neighbor he took advantage of my trust and to a lesser extent he took advantage of my family when a boy. <br>
<br>
The whole damn neighborhood has been terrorised by the lot of them, and their violence around here. Including me. This boy grown into adulthood just never grew up.<br>
<br>
I have gone without sleep many times because junkies would knock at my window asking for food, money, use of my phone and cigarrettes. One comes inside claiming it has been bashed and in fear of death, another is let in by her and another and another all without even asking me. Vice versa their boyfriends called on my window to be let in. This just went on and on. I ended up broke and hungry over many months because 'NO' has no meaning to their women and 'get out' is a mortal insult. <br>
I have been ripped off things I had to scrimp for to afford. It ran up my bills, left me hungry, and broke and tired and angry. I couldn't leave my dwelling until they were all out, I had my own life and it was being destroyed by dirt that abused my good faith. <br>
<br>
My life has been threatened at knifepoint a number of times. <br>
<br>
I have had fights with them before ( New Years Eve, 2 on 1 again). One night I did let in a drunk who had been evicted and he needed a bed, guess what, he pulled a knife on me. He was an abusive bastard who happened to be mean when drunk. He called around drunk again 3am at night running his knife up and down on my security door. I refused to answer, I had a intervention order on them all and had avoided them like plague for months. He smashed my front window, he smashed windows up and down the street, and he died of his cuts: he bled to death in the main street outside his own cousins window. They didn't let him in. His blood was smeared all over their window. <br>
I wasn't going to stand 'grandiose' bullshit from a punk who knew me better. None of their promises to repay me ever came good, I became a standing joke. My phone bill went up $895 for one month's service. I paid it. They laughed. They ate more of my food than I did: I went hungry. They used my shower and the laundry machine to a degree I didn't have my home to myself anymore, and that was downright invasive. My neighbors complained. They were getting called too. It seemed my fault that the junkies came around. Newsflash, they victimised the flats before I moved here too. They didn't give a @#%$. <br>
Same attitude applied to my $20 he didn't give a @#%$, and that's what I cared about more. I never seriously expected him to pay. I wanted my self respect back and I have it. <p><p><br><br><h1 align="LEFT"><font size=1>signed Mistyglen</h1></font></p><p><br><h1 align="CENTER"><font size=1>A GREEN Dragon lies beneath!</font></h1>

Maybe you will get stabbed. Maybe you will just have some ribs broken. Maybe just maybe you will wake up in a bodybag. <br>
<br>
Dude for 20 bucks it is just not worth it.<br>
<br>
Shame and anger make people do some crazy things. I know one thing from my 32 years on this earth. You have shamed the other guys, and it won't end there.<br>

And no I am not threating him. I don't even know the guy. But crap like this is what gets a small bad situation, into a big bad situation.<br>

I worried about the same thing.<br>
<br>
Certainly I've put myself at risk of a payback but having dealt with it before, pretty much lived with it before, peace is something I value as the prize. $20 is just conversational. <br>
<br>
I can look forward to more, I am no mountain of courage but I do keep the screws on. If I am not pushy when the abuse starts all that amounts to is some shoving me around and maybe another fight. Fighting back is okay around here if you win. <br>
<br>
Nobody hiding their identity wants to draw attention to the present whereabouts and a positive identitification, alas for my sinking heart (and haha been there too) I have entered the serpents nest, and I walked out again, this time. I can stand a bloody lip, black eye, broken ribs and usual melee stuff: Shukokai, ya know... Anything more just won't work to the other sides advantage, and you can bet on it, the people concerned frequently have much to hide.<br>
<br>
It wasn't smart to bring it up, I did though and I backed my next play because no-one else was clapping me over the record to date previously. I will face the fallout when I come to it. The punk in question is more likely to talk big about the whole thing and avoid me in future without letting on to his mates, we shall not meet again. The fact is I don't play their game. Police and public review are in my arsenal: their deal is not getting caught.

This guy sounds like a real coward (I mean, who else would pull out a knife just because he got hit in the face; fight like a man!).  But, coward or no, if he feels like he's been backed in a corner, he could be as dangerous as anybody.

Anyways, here's what happened...<br>
<br>
One day on the bus he had a pair of cleats he wanted to sell, I said I'd try them out and see if the fit, etc. so he gave them to me to take home for the night. The next day I forgot to bring them to school, and at lunch I was in the back field playing soccer with a bunch of friends (there had to have been a good 100 people around, playing and watching) and suddenly this tool from the bus comes walking out into the field mid game and grabs my arm as I'm jogging past, so I stop, the game stops, everyone stops and watches to see what's up, and this @#%$ tells me to give him his money for the cleats. I told him I forgot them at home, and they are too tight anyways, so he says &quot;I don't care, you said you'd buy them, give me my money&quot;<br>
<br>
By this time all my friends are crowded around, outnumbering his friends 3/1, and he's still being an ass. I said &quot;what about all the money I've loaned you over the years so you can get a chocolate bar here, a pop there? what about that? why not just give me the @#%$ shoes and let it be done at that&quot; and he has the @#%$ nerve to say &quot;yeah, well, you never asked me for the money back&quot; &quot;yes I did, I always did. In fact when I realized you weren't gonna pay me back, I wanted to stop loaning you money, but you would harass and harass and swear up and down how you were gonna pay me back in a couple days. I would end up loaning you the money so you would shut up&quot;<br>
<br>
His response to all this... &quot;you didn't remind me to pay you back after the times you loaned me money, so it doesn't count&quot; &quot;You're @#%$ stupid&quot; I said. At this point I'm thinking maybe he'll go away. He's there looking pissed off, I'm looking pissed off, his friends are eyeing up my friends, and this fucktard says... &quot;well I want the money, give me your Oakley sunglasses to keep till you give me the money&quot; I laughed handed my bag to a good friend not playing soccer so they couldn't try and steal it when I left it alone, and walked back onto the field. This guy and his friends just watched me, looking all pissed off, they stood around for like 3 minutes, and finally walked off the field. He never once mentioned the shoes to me again, and I still have them somewhere <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>If I was an Autobot, I'd be:<br>

<br>
And you're proud of it?<br>
<br>
&gt; I wanted my self respect back and I have it<br>
<br>
Your idea of self respect is to punch up some guy who's probably drugged up and out of it, and run away to hide behind the single mothers, elderly etc? OK. I'm being harsh about the running away bit. Hitting this guy in some dark alley with his mates could have been suicidal.<br>
<br>
Sorry, this guy might be scum. You've clearly tried to help people in the past, and it's gone badly for you. Maybe violence is the simplest language to communicate with these guys in, but personally I find it offensive to go out of your way to start a fight.<br>
<br>
Vaguely reminiscent of the case I was on jury duty for. The victim was a long term heroin addict and drug dealer who'd spent half his life in jail. The accused  was a young guy who had just hooked up with the wrong crowd. Don't think he had a record or anything. He got into a fight in a public place (standing up for his girlfriend it seems). He was convicted of &quot;malicious wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm&quot;. Since it couldn't be shown that he intended the logical consequence of his actions, he was found not guilty of &quot;wounding with intent to murder&quot;. Victim was definately scum. Accused was probably not. Didn't mean he was in the right. <p>----------------------------------<br>
