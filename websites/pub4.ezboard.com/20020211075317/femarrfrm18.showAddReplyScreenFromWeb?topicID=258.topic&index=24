America won the war? That's news.&quot;<br>
<br>
Excuse me, but how do you think fights are won? Answer the question, my little tulip. Do you think you win  a fight with defense? No, you don't.<br>
<br>
You win a fight by knocking the other man out.<br>
<br>
Did American troops and supplies constitute the large majority of the OFFENSIVE against Germany? Yes, they did.<br>
<br>
So did we knock the other man out? Yes, we did. <br>
<br>
Then I guess we did win the war, didn't we? Yes, we did.<br>
<br>
So I guess that must be news to you. <br>
<br>
If you've got your little finger on some alternate history, then share it...mate. If the rest of the Allies didn't NEED American assistance, then why did they work so hard to get it?<br>
<br>
ANSWER THE FUCKING QUESTION, GENIUS. I can't wait.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Fact: the U.S. military fought at the 2nd World War, they were fighting on the Allies side; observe that America at home alone did not fight a war, it watched its troops fighting at THE war over in Europe...&quot;<br>
<br>
So now America is some...what...seperate entity from its people? &quot;It&quot;? What is &quot;it&quot;? You think a country is some kind of nebulous construct that just dispatches soldiers and then sits back to watch with a bowl of popcorn?<br>
<br>
You think those troops materialized from thin air? No, they were drafted, from the general population. The rest of the population worked to support the troops. <br>
<br>
You want me to get a grip? Why don't you get an education.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;The people of America stayed home.&quot;<br>
<br>
Really? Well, I guess the conscriptions never happened. Must be a myth. You hear that everyone? My grandfather stayed home. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;...honestly do you deserve all credit for the Great War?&quot;<br>
<br>
Nope. I've merely asserted the position that the Allies could not have WON the war without America. <br>
<br>
You see, Misty...come here, son. You see, when you fight people, it's a good idea to win. Getting the shit kicked out you isn't a good thing. You don't get credit for having to scrape your teeth out of the dirt.<br>
<br>
Taking credit on the basis of getting your ass beaten to a pulp doesn't impress anyone, mostly because it's stupid. <br>
<br>
When you win, you get the credit. If you do most of the work towards winning, you get most of the credit. That's life.<br>
<br>
Now, I don't want you to think that I don't understand you. I understand your point of view. <br>
<br>
You think that since our civilians at home weren't slaughtered en masse, that we didn't actually fight in the war. You think that since we underwent no significant hardship, that we don't deserve the credit of winning.<br>
<br>
One question, though. If someone tries for an hour to open a jar of mayo, and then his roomate comes in and pops it open with ease...who gets the credit?<br>
<br>
His roomate does. The other guy is just a dip who tried for an hour to open a stupid mayo jar and failed miserably.<br>
<br>
His roomie opened the mayo, Misty. Not him. The first guy certainly suffered, but the second guy was definitely the winner.<br>
<br>
Have a nice day. Enjoy the mayo.<br>

These kind of statements are statements that really &quot;irk&quot; me. It's interesting to note that over 70% of german casulties came by the hand of Russian soldiers. It was the Russians who were engaged in the largest battles in the War, and the largest sieges of the war. From the battle of Stalingrad, to the battle which later become known as the &quot;death ride&quot; of the 4th Panzer army (on the Kursk Salient), where German and Soviet armor clashed in the greatest tank battle of WWII. The nimble but outgunned Soviet T-34 medium tanks literally charged into the ranks of the mighty German Tiger tanks. This battle, made at the cost of great Soviet losses, finally broke the power of German Panzer troops. It was the Soviets that first broke the German front lines, and it was the Soviets who on April 30th planted there flag in Berlin. <br>
<br>
I believe it was Stalin who said something like &quot;The Americans provide the Money, the British provide the Courage, and the Russians provide the Blood&quot;. <br>
<br>
However, it's easy to downplay the role of the Soviets. It's easy to suggest that anyone who was a victim, was a &quot;loser&quot; (which is often not the case).<br>
<br>
However, unlike Mistywolf, i do believe American's made important contributions. From the amphibious invasion in Sicily(which in terms of troops and ships was larger then operation overlord), to D-day itself (and the opening of a second front), American's contributions were undoubtadly important. Also, it's hard to ignore the British, who also made significant contributions to both Sicily and D-day, and the rest of the war. <br>
<br>
And while you may &quot;lose a war&quot; or a battle, you are a winner because no matter how bad you lost, you still caused the German's to loose many men, many vehicles, and at the very least, time, ammunition, oil, and money. <br>
<br>
The war was not won by the Americans, it was won by everyone who fought in the war, against the oppression of Nazi germany. <br>
<br>
Most of my readings (Atleast to refresh my memory of what i know from the past), are obtained from the Encyclopedia Britanica &quot;The Experience of WWII&quot;, and one of the chapters, is called &quot;The Soviet defeat of Nazi Germany&quot;. <br>

It is America's participation which I par down from national holocaust to troops and equipt. to taking part some time late in the war. There were entire nations immersed in that war, never forget. American participation did not amount to that scale of 'involvement'. Didn't crack 'Enigma' either. Any kind of fight to stay alive against the interdicts of enemy states constitutes human valor in war action: fighting starvation, loss of home and family, fleeing invasion, resistance, counter-intelligence, sabotage etc. By that token America had less involvement than entire nations had and that may have been the very factor which decided the war. Hah. Funny when looked at that way. Overall survival of nation &gt; point scoring<br>
