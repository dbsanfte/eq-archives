<br>
Israel gets the PR for several reasons. One is their involvement in popular press. Two is their influence financially. The biggest reason is the guilt industry. They suffered genocide at the hands of Nazi Germany (among others) and, like we say in Australia on Anzac Day &quot;lest we forget&quot;. Interested parties do not want you to forget the devastation wrought on the Jewish faith in WW2. It is nearly impossible to give any type of contrary to Israel opinion without being branded Goebbels right hand man or a David Duke wannabe.<br>
It is nearly impossible. <br>
<br>
I can talk of the Japanese freely. So can most people. Yet Manchuria was decimated by the Rising Sun in the early pre-WW2 era. Absolutely decimated. I'm not sure of the death toll, but it was in the millions. And Japan still teaches its kids that America was the aggressor in WW2...<br>
<br>
Temujin decided that there were 20 million Chinese too many too in the 13th Century. This is still the largest amount of people to die by genocide in recorded history.<br>
<br>
But you cannot speak freely of the Jewish faith. You mention the slightest iota against the State of Israel, you are a Nazi, anti-this anti-that yadda yadda.<br>
<br>
Mainly though this guilt industry exists the State of Israel. Mainly. There was rumblings and sabre-rattlings of it happening before WW2, but it took, sadly for all concerned, Jews and all, a genocide, to galvanize this sentiment and give life to the State of Israel...<br>
<br>
With almost zero consideration to the inhabitants there, Arab, Assyrian, Armenian or otherwise. A lot of the Jews who migrated to Israel can't even be considered Semitic ethno-linguistically. Israel basically gave any Jew automatic citizenship and residence...all you had to do was move there. For what reason was this done for? Ask yourself...was it because they were hated everywhere else? Maybe...was it because of the religious tenet they hold that they are God's Chosen People? Maybe...or was it because they knew Arab reaction to the Balfour Agreement and needed the population to stave off the inevitable. Most likely the latter.<br>
<br>
The State of Israel remains the most disgraceful case of creative cartography ever devised by colonialists. Unfortunately, a lot of the Levant suffers this. Look up the Trucial Zones one day, or the Partitioning of India for another glowing example.<br>
<br>
My wish? That Israel ceases to be Israel and becomes the nation of commingled people it was for 2500 years before the British and the US played map making on an ugly scale. Believe it or not, Hebrew, Arab, Assyrian, Armenian, Cypriot, Turk, etc, lived in relative amity during this occasion. It took the genius of Balfour and his buddies and the evil of Adolf Hitler to bring it down.<br>
<br>
Chiteng: The situation re: Turkey and Greece over Cyprus is a dirty, dirty affair. Neither side is right. Cyprus doesn't even belong to Greece, despite a lot of my people's call for &quot;enosis&quot;.<br>
<br>
Essentially (and this is extremely condensed) Cyprus's inhabitants are paying for the sins of their grandfathers, which is not unusual considering the proud and nostalgic outlook my people (Ellhniki) and the Turks have.<br>
<br>
Strangely enough, the sordid affair involves Britain too...<br>
<br>
And, lastly, Dreadwolff...if you don't like what you see on this thread; two things a) don't read it and b) don't post to it, and don't ask for it to be deleted, simply because it doesn't fit your vision of a rant and flame. It may be irrelevant to EQ, but by hell, it is more serious and debatable subject than the latest 13 year old dweeb to diddle you of 300 pp somewhere. Call me an elitist prick, but I'd rather read an interesting debate on something than see *insert name here* is a motherfucker 'cos he ripped me off a MoSS or whatever...<br>

<font color=yellow>But I think your a coward for all it's worth. Why don't you do something that will actually make a difference.<br>
</font color><br>
<br>
Well geez, I will get Arafat on the phone right now, and start making differences right away!<br>
<br>
<font color=yellow>I'm not anti-palestinian. Im anti-agressive palestinian without a point or a clue.</font color><br>
<br>
You don't need to sugar-coat your personal beliefs with wordplay.  You are anti-arab.  Believe me, Kerryn, I have dealt with people like you my entire life.  You are as stereotypical about arabic people as white people in America are stereotypical about black people being dangerous/stupid people.  It's really sad.  I will prove your raging racism further down the post.<br>
<br>
<font color=yellow>You skip poignant questions and retort with your view that Israel has a racist apartheid government, yet you can't back that up with anything other then your personal opinion.</font color><br>
<br>
I think the most interesting phenomenon about this entire argument is that no one can see the utter truth.  Whether or not the country was clean, dirty, etc....the Palestinians owned it, and WANTED it, in 1949.  You people seem to think they didn't care about the land, therefore it allowed the Israelis to 'take over and give it the TLC it needs.'  That isn't the case.  I don't care WHAT the Israelis have done to the land, cultivated it, etc....(nothing on their own, REMEMBER THIS...this is only happening due to the British and the American governments.  The Israeli government is, and always has been too ignorant to do anything ON THEIR OWN)....the fact is that the land still doesn't belong to them.<br>
<br>
Examples:<br>
<br>
"Since we, the Americans, took Native American land and made it better, its naturally ours now."<br>
<br>
or...<br>
<br>
"Since we, Microsoft, stole IBM-DOS and made it a lot better, then MS-DOS is rightfully ours, always has been, and dammit, we created it!"<br>
<br>
These things are clearly wrong.  If you don't agree that they are wrong, then you probably are either a criminal, or an ignorant egoist.  One or the other.<br>
<br>
<font color=yellow>You live in a house Miblis? Your own place? It belongs to you but if you use that house and it's location to your advantage to shoot at people then the police will remove your access to that house. Are you going to say their Anti-Miblis...or just Anti-anyone shooting at people?</font color><br>
<br>
My house belongs to me.  I didn't throw the previous family out and take it, renovate it, add a sunroom to it, drop a swimming pool in the backyard, then claim it to be mine just because I did those things.  So the above statement from you, Kerryn, is unfortunately just ignorant.  Perhaps you were angry, and that's why you said it.  Not sure what your intentions were with that, heh.  My dollars are on your prejudice toward me, and all middle eastern people.<br>
<br>
<font color=yellow>So I fully support the Israeli government turfing people out of a village </font color><br>
<br>
That's because you're racist.  The land doesn't belong to them.  They're doing the same thing now, they did in 49.  There's the Israeli Government for you.<br>
<br>
Now before you mention "All you ever come back with, is that the land doesn't belong to Israel," let me explain something to you.  <b>The land doesn't belong to Israel.</b>  I have not seen one valid argument, on why the Israelis were entitled to that land in 1949.  Not a single one.  Read through this thread, and the other if you wish.  Tell me if you see one valid argument on why you think Israel was entitled that land.  Because they had it almost 2000 years ago?  You know as well as I do, that is a bullshit excuse to suddenly want it back now.  You also know that if Hitlier/Nazi's never happened, they wouldn't be in Israel right now.  The Holocaust is used as an excuse for EVERYTHING, and it shouldn't be used for this.<br>
<br>
<font color=yellow>Er, wrong idiot. It's a well know fact on this board that I'm British </font color><br>
<br>
Damn, no wonder!  It was in fact, your people that blindly gave the country to the Israelis to begin with.  Merely reinforcement for my statement that most of you are sheep.<br>
<br>
<font color=yellow>They have places to live and they aren't content with that because they believe all Israel is theirs</font color><br>
<br>
Talk about not remembering shit.  Do you remember the previous thread, Kerryn?  The land 'given to them' doesn't BELONG to the Palestinians, that is the entire problem.  The land is under Israeli Jurisdiction.  That's the problem.  You obviously don't understand where I am coming from, whatsoever.  Not to mention the fact that you don't read.  Of course, you are a sheep so that explains it clearly.<br>
<br>
<font color=yellow>If they had no land and couldn't survive I may support your case of genocide but that's not the case.</font color><br>
<br>
They have no land.  (Please remember this time, so I don't have to repeat this for the umpteenth time later on)<br>
<br>
<font color=yellow>It's the justification they need to walk into a restaurant at lunch time and kill three dozen people who are just trying to live their lives in an area that they have laid claim to for thousands of years.<br>
<br>
It's the justification they need to mortar bomb a school for Jewish children.<br>
<br>
It's the justification they need to blow up a delegation of ambassadors trying to negotiate a treaty.</font color><br>
<br>
The British have done the same throughout the years, and not any less then the Arabs.  Your raging racism allows you to look at one side, and not the other.  You'll probably tell me to take my own advice.  See, I can see the other side.  The Palestinians will let the Jews have some, probably even most of the land.  Just give the Palestinians land that belongs to THEM, and not the Jews.  Do you hear it this time?  Are you starting to understand it now?  Can you grasp the situation here?  Can you begin to just reach at possibly seeing that maybe I have a point?<br>
<br>
Can you?<br>
<br>
<font color=yellow>The fact the Jewish were conquered by almost every middle eastern race along the way hasn't stopped them in their belief that that is their promised land. But things have changed now. They have the power to hold on to what's theirs and killing their children won't make them go away, to do that you have to kill every one. You are likely to make them retaliate and your much more likely to have them neutralize that threat.</font color><br>
<br>
Their promised land?  If God had promised the land to them, it would be theirs, on their own.  You know why the Israelis have that land.  They didn't get it on their own.<br>
<br>
Hah, the Israelis have no power.  The Israeli government is weak and frail.  They carry no weight on their own.  Their Prime Minister-of-the-week program shows how unorganized they are.  Did I mention they have no power?  They cannot stand up for themselves.  They need the United States to help them.  Israel is the United States.  They aren't their own country.  They, along with the Americans, are doing exactly what the British did in South Africa.  For you to not see the lack of difference between SA and Israel makes you quite blind.  This is Apartheid.  Hopefully, an influencial Arab leader (which Arafat is not, I must admit), will rise up like Mandela and take back what is rightfully the Palestinians, or at least a part of the land.<br>
<br>
<font color=yellow>This excerpt from your post tells me that you know absoloutley nothing about what is going on over there other then the propoganda and the party line. But the discussion is complete. Mainly because you're running from the truth. Which is funnily enough where you think we started. </font color><br>
<br>
Propaganda?  Party line?  There is a simple truth here, Kerryn.  I explained it quite well in this post, and many others.  The land doesn't belong to the Israelis.  More specifically, who the land belongs to, shouldn't be up to the Israelis, or the Americans/British for that matter.  The Palestinians can certainly be fair if they are given some stroke on how things should be ran.  They have no stroke, and they have no power.  This is sad, since the land is theirs to begin with.<br>
<br>
<font color=yellow>The rest of the world is slowly forming the opinion of mentally insane arabs with tea-towels on their heads killing little children. Now you can take that as an insult if you wish but I am only telling you what I think the media is showing and the response it is provoking.</font color><br>
<br>
The media is primarily American/British owned.  That's your stereotype.  That's your belief.  That's why you are nothing, but a racist sheep, Kerryn.<br>
<br>
<font color=yellow>Well I guess you just come across as another hostile arab.</font color><br>
<br>
You said this plain as day.  You weren't quoting anyone, you said this yourself, as a statement from your own mind.<br>
<br>
It's this stereotypical bullshit that makes you racist, Kerryn.  I haven't made a single statement against Jews as a people.  All my statements have been anti-Israeli Government.<br>
<br>
For Arabic people to not be so offended, and not be so hostile, the racism toward them needs to stop.  Like I have ALWAYS said, nothing excuses killing.  However if you think Arabs shouldn't be angry, then you are racist, or probably just stupid.<br>
<br>
This is a textbook case of racism.  Think about it, Kerryn....you walk into your grocery store, and you see a Muslim family, with the wife covered and the male with a thick black mustache and beard....a few kids at their sides....they are speaking Arabic with eachother.....what do you think about?  Do you just...walk by them and go to the dairy section where you were headed....<br>
<br>
Nah, you think about those people.  What kind of people they are.  You think about the suicide bombings....at least for a split second.  You think about Osama Bin Laden, and his blowing up American Embassies....you think about that.<br>
<br>
You don't just walk by another family shopping at a grocery store.<br>
<br>
It's racists like you that are responsible for everything.  Interesting, I just switched it on you, and justified it.<br>
<br>
I can hardly wait to see the next clouded-by-racism post debuting by Kerryn later on today.<br>
<br>

<br>
Each side can be seen as right using 100% valid logic.<br>
<br>
Each side can also be seen as wrong using 100% valid logic.<br>
<br>
The hatred is so strong in Israel that there will not be peace there in any of our lifetimes, unless one side wipes the other out. <br>
<br>
Sadly, thats exactly what is going to happen, and it's going to happen slowly. Anyone who thinks any of the violence in that area is new needs a serious history lesson. The area between Egypt and Turkey has been the site of more wars and more bloodshed than anywhere in the world. The current fighting has been going on for most of the last century and only got worse in 1948.<br>
<br>
There have been brief periods of relative calm, but even these are filled with small skirmishes and one faction fighting the other. <br>
<br>
The biggest problem is that both sides have a valid claim to the same land and peaceful coexistance is not an option. And since Neither side is willing to leave their god-given holy land, the only result can be war.<br>
<br>
As I mentioned before. Its a war. It will be a war for a long time to come. A long slow war with long drawn out periods of terror, blood and death for all involved.<br>
<br>
The only true way to obtain peace in such a situation is Armed Occupation by a third, neutral party. The occupation would have to last three generations, long enough for those who feel the hate now to die. Unfortuneatly no political body is willing to commit to such a long occupation. Modern attempts at occupying territory to enforce coexistance between factions all fail because the peacekeepers are called home too soon. <br>
<br>
History has shown us that occupation does work to bring a population into harmonious coexistance. However the last time this has been a documented success would be the Holy Roman Empire. Prior to that the Romans understood the need for long term military occupation. Sadly the only such occupation that currently exists in a state that could remotely be called a success would be the Taliban in Afganistan...but that is a different story. It might be important to note that in every successful case the occupied land became part of the occupier's nation or the occupying force took over the local government. I don't see that happening in Israel.<br>
<br>
The only way other than armed occupation for the Palestines and the Israelis to come together in peace would be to provide both of them with an even more despicable Enemy. This could bring the two factions together very rapidly. Historical examples would be Scotland unifying against England. <br>
<br>
If the US really wanted to help the Israelis and the Palestinians get along we would invade them with obvious intent to conquer and assimilate, making our nation appear as the evil oppressor. But that would backfire, I am sure and while we would certainly bring Israel together as one nation, we would get the rest of the world against us.<br>
<br>
I guess the bottom line is Israel is just a bad place to be right now and doesn't look like it will be getting better any time soon. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/upoppensteelfist.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Poppen Steelfist</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 77<br> <font color=#E9D756>(9/7/01 10:02:19 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=144.topic&index=64>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Interesting....</span><hr size=1> Miblis..I'm a white American.

Like Poppen I live in the south , Georgia actually, I have seen all sorts of stuff that people have labled Racism , and today espically in my view ( which i could be wrong on) the word racism is just said to try to win a arguement that one cant win with other examples.. <br>
<br>
Do me a favor , for everything you think is racism , look for a example of the oposite .. I bet you will find it .. <br>
<br>
ex  The black people are poor and downtrodden and live in rundown cities and cant get good jobs cause of racism ... look around with open eyes and you will see the same for white, red , green blue yellow and all the other colored people in the world..<br>
<br>
Win a arguement with facts , Not a race card.. <br>

I grew up in the South and during my 30 years alive I have made and kept many many black friends. In fact, I've never even called them black becuase I don't notice anymore. I take extreme offence to your childish generalization and your obvious ignorance. You are screaming about stereotyping when in fact you are guilty of the worst by far in this thread. Next time you plan on posting mindless crap like that you really should better evaluate your own words. Any respect I may have had or any worth I may have seen in your posts and this thread was shot to hell by that last post. You had a chance to get some good points across here but you blew it by playing a race card that just doesn't cut it anymore, and by attempting to generalize and classify when you yourself are ranting against it. Not good bro you don't win an argument by becoming that which you rail against.</font color><br>
<br>
Did I say all white Americans?  It's people like you who don't READ, that come in here and turn 5 or 6 more people against me.  Read my posts, so I am not misinterpreted, ok?<br>
<br>
Don't use the bullshit excuse of "oh you had good points, etc etc etc, and now I disagree because of..."...you're like everyone else here.  Am I suddenly picking out racists left and right?<br>
<br>
If I had good points, I had good points.  Just because I made a semi-generalization by saying a lot of Americans are scared of black people, or think they are less intelligent...which unfortunately is TRUE (that a lot of people think that), doesn't mean my points are suddenly invalid.<br>
<br>
Don't just hop on the band wagon like most everyone else here.  I am very confident with every word that comes out of my mouth, and every explanation I throw up onto this thread.  Try not to be like these other people, Poppen.<br>
<br>
Eltherion, you are always one of wise words.  It's a shame others don't post like you and Arnwolf do.  Very classy individuals (and no, I am not being sarcastic).  I welcome any debatable comments from either of you two.  Hopefully others can approach this debate with the same type of attitude, unlike the way Kerryn has, and the way Makril originally approached it.<br>

Well hell, you can turn any of my sentences against me, can't you?  I didn't say all, I didn't say few, as a matter of fact, I was very vague.  I wasn't very general at all.<br>
<br>
Want me to rephrase?  I don't know whats so offending about that.  I am not saying that white people are discriminating against the blacks, which a lot of people think is still happening.  I don't think thats happening any more.  However, I certainly think that MANY white people are scared of blacks, and many (before meeting these people and realizing they are like everyone else, if not more intelligent in a lot of situations) think that they are less intelligent.<br>
<br>
This is damn true, and I am not ashamed to say it.<br>

<br>
Let me tell you this, you come across as hostile and you support the Palestine regime. ergo. you just come across as another hostile arab. If it's a fact it's not racism. Only the manner in which it is displayed makes something racist.<br>
<br>

Nah, you think about those people. What kind of people they are. You think about the suicide bombings....at least for a split second. You think about Osama Bin Laden, and his blowing up American Embassies....you think about that.<br>

<br>
No it's not interesting. It's you thinking you have justified calling me racist by one statement, and that statement<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> you think about that.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->makes you the worlds first confirmed psychic. I went to a school in Manchester full of muslim and black families. I grew up learning about Diwali and Eid ( I apologize for my ignorance of not knowing how to spell eid ) surrounded by muslim people and not once did I think of bombings. The first time I thought about suicide bombings was when Martigan started his post on suicide bombings and you piped in with your justification then too. Want me to tell you what really interests me?? Are the suicide bombers thinking this as they walk into that crowded restaurant &quot;They all hate me, they all think of me as an Arab bomber&quot; Are THEY all as psychic as you are?<br>
<br>
You should have just stated in Martigans thread that whilst you normally supported the Arabs that bombing was despicable. Instead you started this whole &quot;well they don't own the land and it will stop as soon as they leave&quot;<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> My house belongs to me. I didn't throw the previous family out and take it, renovate it, add a sunroom to it, drop a swimming pool in the backyard, then claim it to be mine just because I did those things.

My dollars are on your prejudice toward me, and all middle eastern people.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Actually it makes you ignorant I think because you completely missed the point that no matter who the house belongs to, once you use it as a weapon you forfeit your right to it. I dont care if your great great greart great granny esmerelda bought it 300 years ago and you have the title deeds to prove it. I'm not angry Miblis, a little frustrated by how brainwashed you are is about all.<br>

<br>
The only channels you actually receive anywhere outside the UK that is UK made is the BBC and the BBC world service. The americans own a fair bit but you'll find Europe has its own news stations. So too does China and Japan, Australia and more. That covers most of the occupied continents. North Africa is slowly building its television and radio network and anywhere below that on the map is either too preoccupied by whats happening in it's own backyard or has not progressed to that level yet.<br>
<br>
Considering we really have so little control over whats going on in the news other then on our own little island why is it that other societies other then British, Israeli and American think the Palestinians are the agressors here? Now whilst I don't say that being part of a majority makes you right, being part of such a small minority should really make you think about coming down off the cloud you're on.<br>

<br>
Yada yada yada. Mind if I nod off? You've said that 57 times in the last two threads. Over and over again you claim the land belongs to Palestine but you still don't have anything other then this as a basis for an argument. So it belonged to them 52 years ago. It belonged to Jews before. It belonged to someone else before that and now it belongs to Israel again. But that doesn't give any of them a right to it.<br>
<br>
Miblis, you come across as a robot, an agressive and possibly fanatical Arab who honestly believes that Arabs own the land and are justified in killing for it. At the end of the day I don't care who owns the land but you wont get to govern it while their is violence to the goverment that controls it. Either way your a stuck record so I'm not going to respond to you after this. If you don't mind I'll chat with Ujulain.<br>

I agree totally. But it's not going to happen whilst Palestinians are murdering people. I would hope that the area comes under a new rule, with both Israelis and Palestines jointly but I know it's not going to happen soon. I hope that British cartography can help in a fair way but nobodys going to shift any lines on a map at the moment.<br>
<br>
I'd also like for Northern Ireland to sort itself out and to fall under a new Northern Irish rule. For gods sake the English aren't doing a good job of it but be buggered if we're going to give it to the republic just because the IRA is blowing up the local McDonalds in Warrington.<br>
<br>
In both cases, stop the killing and we'll sit down and talk. I got lucky. When the bomb went off in Manchester the only thing damaged was the paintwork on my car that was showered in half a ton of glass, but to those that lost friends, family, people I knew it sickens me. Anyway, I digress.....<br>
<br>
I think you're wrong when you say if you mention Israels and the Jews your racist. Maybe it's true I don't know but if that's your experience then who am I to refute it. I would like to think that we can sit at our keyboards and talk about it.<br>
<br>
You're also right when you say that we don't want to forget what happened to the Jewish. But I don't think the holocaust should ever be forgotten. I may be ignorant of some of the other wars your talking about ergarding the turkish and all and feel free if you wish to expand my education but people over here have relatives killed by the germans, jewish friends, and such and for that it rings closer to home.<br>
<br>
This generation wont be the last to harp on about WWII but in time the stain that is still afforded to the Germans by the older generation will passwith them. I hold no enmity towards Germans. As this happens people will chalk up the holocaust and the destruction of the Jews to another generation to a lesson learnt. I dont think we don't want to forget just to invoke that guilt you talk of. Perhaps others do I don't know.<br>
<br>
You mention that Japan still teaches it's children that America was the agressor in WWII. I have to say I don't understand this. What you say astounds me because I realise the extent you'd have to go to to this to make it work. Which is not to say I disbelieve you. I am just astounded by that.<br>
<br>
You have to remove all the history books and all the films, you have to stop people getting access at American newspapers from that time, British newspapers. You have to silence anyone who speaks anything other then the truth, cut relevant access to the net, the list goes on.<br>
<br>
I understand that there are some American's who think that the war lasted for 2 years and America was involved from the start. Some Americans think that they won the war for us. I spoke to an American girl when I was grouped in Mistmoore one day who told me the British were stupid for not napalming france and germany,  instead sending soliders to die on french shores. But thats ignorance and not brainwashing as you mention in Japan or as I see in Miblis. Its a different thing.<br>
<br>
There are holes in my learning and I need to fill them. But one thing I'm sure of. The Arabs are not doing a lot to help themself and I can't argue with the way the Israeli government have reacted.<br>
<br>
Fill me in on something will you. The particular piece of land we're talking about. We know it as Israel. What do Arabs call it and what has it been known as historically? <p><HTML><CENTER>

Along with being a racist, which you have not disproven in any part of your last post.....you are now a pathological liar. Basically, you are lying about something that has obviously been proven not true earlier in these discussions.<br>
<br>
Oh what?  You don't understand what I'm talking about?  Do you remember how I said...."nothing justifies killing"?<br>
<br>
Do you remember that at all?  Put the crackpipe down, take a few deep breaths, and think about it.  Do you remember at what points I stated that nothing justifies killing?  Oh you don't remember?<br>

You don't belong in this thread, and you have overstayed your welcome.  Go ahead and begin agreeing with things I have been saying all along while you go talk to Ulujain.<br>

Well, in a previous thread, the first thing out of Caoilfhionn's keyboard in response to exactly what I'm writing here were terms like I mentioned; anti-Semitic, etc...see? Even here, in this insignificant corner of the Web, you cannot have a debate with the subject of Israel in it without the usual name-throwing. The State of Israel needs to lose its &quot;protected species&quot; status with a few people before these issues can be dealt with sanely and without name-calling. I stated then, and I will state now, I have nothing against the Jewish faith, or the Hebrew people. I am firmly against the concept of the State of Israel. It, like the former &quot;Bantustans&quot; of South Africa, are a creation to appease one class out of many; hence its innate unfairness to those there already. <br>
<br>
The Palestinians have nowhere else to go. The area has been their home since the time of Christ and beyond. To suddenly be told, sorry, but your Semitic cousins the Hebrews, and those who follow their faith, Judaism, are now your Government and your rulers would come as an awful surprise to anyone.<br>
<br>
The idea that Arabs are a homogenous people too is far from the truth. The Turks overran them on the divide and conquer principle. They were (and remain to some extent) tribes. The Palestinians can't just get up and move to Saudi Arabia or Egypt because their &quot;Arab brothers&quot; are there. Not going to happen.<br>
<br>
The area where the State of Israel has been called Palestine for a long, long time. The name &quot;Palestine&quot; has no Arab background. It is a Latin derivation of a Greek work for the Phoenicians. Phillistia.<br>
<br>
The Romans called it Judaea. I'm not sure what the Turks referred to it as when it was a mere vilayet. Maybe just Palestine.<br>
<br>
As such it is, technically, a neutral name. Or it should be.<br>

Direct from Japanese school textbooks on WW2 history. The Australian Government made a huge issue of this some time back and asked Japan to 'fess up on certain realities. According to Japan, they were forced to bomb Pearl Harbor as America was impinging on their territorial gains and sovereignty in such places. There's a lot more to it than this, but, unless Japan has done a volte-face, it's what their schoolchildren are taught.<br>

Most of the Republic of Ireland gave up it's claim to Northern Ireland a long time ago. A great percentage of it in fact. But it's not really the Republic of Ireland that is the problem. Its the factions of people in Northern Ireland who believe that Northern Ireland should fall under Irish rule as opposed to English.<br>
<br>
But this is where it gets tricky. And it's the same way in Israel. <br>
<br>
Once they lose the backing of the people, the only course for the fanatic is terrorism. A demonstration with picket boards is useless because you have no support, the only way they seem to be able to sway people is to kill.<br>
<br>
I can't say that Irish people are all killers in the same way I never said all arabs were killers. Contrary to beliefs when I hear of the word Arab, I think Arabian Nights and Aladdin quicker then I think bomber or killer, most time not even thinking about bombing. When I think of Ireland I think shamrocks and how horrible Guinness is before I think IRA. <br>
<br>
It is regretfully those factions, who take it upon themselves to get the reaction they want through shock factor. In Ireland at the moment the shock factor comes from stopping children from getting to their school whether by shooting at them or just throwing bricks. It's been described as &quot;running the gauntlet on the way to educate our children&quot; <br>
<br>
It's not every Arab that shoots at the neighbouring village but it is a group of 10 Arabs in a village with a population of 60 that becomes a problem and the cause for removal. But the problem is that people were coming from other areas to shoot from that village. It's not the 10 people from the village or the friends who come to join them but the strategic position of the village that becomes a threat.<br>
<br>
The fact is that this land does not belong to Palestinians. It does not belong to the Jewish. It belongs to nobody and arguing about who occupied the land 2000 years ago is pointless. Arguing who occupied the land 50 years ago is pointless. The fact is that right now Arabs and Israelis are occupying that land and I wish they would come to an agreement.<br>
<br>
But as I say their will be no lasting peace in Ireland whilst the IRA refuse to decommission their weapons and stop bombing. Equally their will be no peace in Israel until a certain faction of Arabs stop killing others.<br>
<br>
To add to that there will be no peace in either place whilst the attitude from the people is, &quot;their is no justification to killing but what do you expect when they take our land&quot; Its an oxymoron in itself.<br>
<br>
But here's something to think on. Give the land to the Palestinians and the Israelis should leave. Well no...because then the Israelis have nowhere to live. But if you give in to that terrorism and split the land in half your sending an open invitation to anyone that the land can be theirs if only they're willing to kill repeatedly for it.<br>
<br>
In 30 years we'd be having the same conversation only we'd be talking about different religious groups/race/factions. <p><HTML><CENTER>

Problem is it doesn't REALLY work.<br>
<br>
We didn't take, we bought.  Problem was, the indians that sold it, didn't own it.  So who's teaching who the art of &quot;con&quot;??<br>
Don't know where you got that &quot;divine destiny&quot; thing... a Custer quote perhaps?? (see &quot;moron4&quot; below)<br>
&quot;we labeled them savages and slaughtered them&quot; (also see &quot;moron4 below)<br>
<br>
The &quot;white man&quot; didn't really have a problem with the Indians.  They usually got along just fine.  UNTIL some beaurocratic moron came along and decided that, well, we need this area now, we'll give you this area over here, but you gotta move as of yesterday and you're only allowed to eat meat when we tell you and the rest of the time we'll tell you what we will and won't allow.  Then said moron would make all kinds of promises that the next moron wouldn't uphold and the Indians kept getting shafted because of it.  In the meantime, moron1 has returned to &quot;civilization&quot; (aka whatever political hub he hailed from) and tells everyone there overblown stories of what he had to go through to accomplish these things.  So while moron2 is trying to make himself look good and get things done, now enters moron3, who has no desire to go see for himself, takes the stories from moron1 as gospel and the difficulties from moron2 as &quot;THEY aren't doing what they promised&quot;, and, gee.... go figure, enter moron4 who gets to be some kind of hero because he made everything all better.  By simply killing everyone off.   And, during all this, you have the &quot;carpetbaggers&quot; going in and cheating the indians (and anyone else whose wallet they could get at), or getting them drunk to get something they want.<br>
<br>
I am, have been and probably always will be pro-native Americans (and I'm Canadian Indian/german).  And what we called &quot;uninhabited&quot;, so did they.  So it was a 6-to1, half dozen of the other deal.  What the indians DIDN'T expect however, was to have so many just keep showing up.  And by the time they did object, they were a little on the late side.  There were too many to just make the white man leave. And since so many had been born there, they had just as much right to be there as the indians did.<br>
<br>
Like it or not, &quot;Palestine&quot; (that wasn't it's name when this started) didn't care about that strip of land when the Jewish people moved there.  And, technically, this argument goes back a LOT farther than 1949.  The Islamics want the Hebrews gone.  But guess what?? That's never going to happen.  As far as that conference goes, think back (no, ya gotta think back farther than that ... ), the Hebrews were the slaves and &quot;second class citizens&quot; for a long time, but that was so long ago, it shouldn't make a difference.  They settled in a little patch of land long ago.  The Islamics drove them out, and they came back.  Both sides are right, and both sides are wrong.  And it's an argument that goes so far back that there's not another country in the world that has any business being in it.  And until BOTH sides can start teaching their children to stop hating, they will continue to fight because it's all they know.  Although, I do believe that teaching a child to fire a weapon is a bit on the extreme and see no way to change how much these people hate when they get it into their heads to do so. <p><Center><IMG SRC="http://www.lof.ukhq.co.uk/sigs/mastorm.jpg"><BR>
