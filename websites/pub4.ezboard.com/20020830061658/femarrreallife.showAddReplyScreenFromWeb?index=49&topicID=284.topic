<br>
Not including knuckles Noses and toes.<br>
<br>
Age 11 Learning to play basketball &quot; rebounding pile up &quot; left tibia the large bottom leg bone. Fight ensued coach and principal had to pull me off the fat kid that landed on me. I still hate basketball.<br>
<br>
Age 13 Right hand all 4 bones across palm &quot;Football&quot; wrapped up a tackle as a team mate hit him dead center on my hand full speed from in front.<br>
<br>
Age 14 Enduro Cross &quot; long distance motercycle racing in the hills of New Mexico &quot;Going up a hill at 65 after a long straight away sharp turn at top of hill 3 trees on left one on right. Cliped a rock buried in the sand sent me rocketing to that single tree on the right side of the left hand turn. Clipped it with my left handle bar. Crushed left hand completly spun handle bar into left side of chest destroying all ribs on that side fractured sturnum and broken Coller bone. Left arm and shoulder hit tree on way past shattering both in several places. Upon landing in a rock pile down slope shatter helmet driving Fiber glass back into my face almost severing left ear. Fractured Jaw Cheek bone and skull. &quot; WOOT LOST NO TEETH &quot; Also broke leg when bike tumbled down slope and landed on me. Smell of burning flesh brings me concious enough to push bike off my ruined leg.  &quot; Flight to hospital 2 and a half years in and out of surgeries Physical therapy and a life time of bragging rights that &quot;I **^^%$%*%^^(  lived&quot; Doctors managed to save ear and put my face back on straight. Told me 50 percent use of leg hand will never work right. I can not play the Violin anymore &quot; Now works for typing at least.&quot; I was running 2 years after accident and back dancing 6 months later. &quot; Never tell an Apache we CAN NOT do something &quot;<br>
<br>
Age 17 Hooray for Van surfing. &quot; or what not to do when your bored &quot; I started off Sober Sitting in park with friends I climb ontop of buddies van for a better view of surrounding ladies. Buddy says Hope down I am running to the store. other two guys on top with me jump down . I start to climb down when he slams into first peels across the gravel parking lot whips a 180 and heads back towards the rear entrance to park. I fly off top mid way through the 180 do a cartwheel in mid air and damned if I dont land on my feet thinking I am the coolest @#%$ alive. Sliding sideways right foot forward in the gravel towards the concrete starts at the entrance. Never saw it as a big barrier before. Sunken foot 35 miles an hour side ways into concrete. I fell at that point. Jump up yell hell yeah land and scream &quot; ^*&amp;%%&amp;%^)^*^*(^&amp;^^ THAT HURTS &quot;  Got drunk as hell here. Didnt take my combat boot off for 3 days cause I knew it would never go back on. Went to Ska concert had a blast in the Mosh pit got really really drunk and suddenly thought hmm maybe I should go to the doctors. Doctors verified broken in 9 places leg fractured but not badly. Had to leave before the cops got there since I was underage and drunk as hell. Never did get it worked on seems to work fine toes dont point the right directions though.<br>
<br>
18 Once again what not to do when your bored. &quot; dead sober this time &quot; Full biker leathers &quot; New Helmet &quot; Standing at a Cliff edge where we used to paty and rock climb. Everyone else is drunk. I Swore off booze for a year. Being sober person at a party is really boring.  I start looking at this tree that sticks up right next to cliff only about 15 foot out. Note: fire light = not a good source of light when judging distances. Figure what the hell freak some drunk people out. Take a running leap at tree that is actually closer to 25 feet out and catch it about half way down start bounceing and tumbiling down tree finally coming to a rest on my right hip about 40 feet later. Still in the tree. UNHURT Climb down tree<br>
<br>
People screaming at top of cliff I am laughing one girl pukes over cliff.  Hearing this coming I turn to run trip and tumble down the @#%$ hillside Break a few ribs and crack my left wrist and ankle. Karma I sure think so.<br>
<br>
There are a few others just knuckles nose and toes that I have broken but those were the big ones.<br>

AWESOME pic man.. laughed my butt off!!  I've taken a few bikes down in my time but never with such grace.  Ok, lets see what I can contribute:<br>
<br>
1) (Nose broken  X 3)  Once by lead pipe, twice by fists.  First time I was running to help some friends in a brawl.  Guy saw me coming and stepped behind a corner.  As I rounded the corner he swung the pipe and caught me about 1/2 inch below my eyes.  Nose got a little crooked.   2nd time was a fairly standard fight.. guy got a good shot in.. nose went crack.. was a little more crooked.  3rd time, guy sucker punched me in nose.. it went crack.. I felt it.. nose was straight again.. I smiled at him for fixing my nose.. and the fight was on.<br>
<br>
2) (Broken knuckles and metacarpals) in both hands from scrapping in my wilder dumber days. (but my pinkies do this neat thing where they pop out of socket now).<br>
<br>
3) (Cracked tailbone) Cleared a rail with drainage ditch on a bike, (well.. almost.. LOL) back tire hit.. chain broke.. tire came off.. I landed on my tailbone on the concrete and limped for about 6 months.<br>
<br>
4) A (few cracks in my skull) from assorted beer bottles, chairs, pipes, etc. (more from my indiscriminate youth and when I bounced as a 2nd job through college).<br>
<br>
5) (Jaw broken) by inept navy dentist pulling a wisdom tooth when I was in the Marines.  They said it wasn't broken so it healed wrong (had a non-union) and at my next duty station they had to file it in half and wire my jaw shut for 6 weeks to line up the bone.<br>
<br>
6) (2 ribs broken) in a bar brawl last january.  Dally vs. 4 meatheads in a bar called &quot;Gutters&quot; (yeah.. I should have known better than to hang at a place with such a name.. but the beautiful bartender gave me free drinks).  Some drunk underage chick comes in trying to start trouble.  Her BF is there.  He said something funny (insulting) to her and I chuckled (I was about 10 feet away sitting at the bar).  She walked up with a bottle in hand and asked ,&quot;What the FVCK are you laughing at?&quot;  I responded, &quot;Young lady, we dont want me involved in your problems, why dont you just walk back over there?&quot;  At which point she actually says &quot;BOP!&quot; and hits me in the side of the head with the bottle.  I whipped around on the stool and backhanded the bottle out of her hand (dont believe in a man hitting a woman).<br>
<br>
  She jumps up.. grabs my arm and yells to her boyfriend that I hit her.  So her BF and 3 buddies jump on me (stupid bitch).  I take two of them out and the other two and I fight for about 5 minutes (at which point the 3 of us have crashed half the bar and are too damn tired to fight anymore).  Near the end, my shoe got stepped on and when it slipped off I went down backwards.  Steve Austin (I SWEAR this dude was a dead ringer for him.. I mean.. was freaky how much he resembled him) came over the top of me.  He had a knee pressed into the left side of my ribcage as he swung down at me and I was swinging up.  I hit the other guy who stood up and kicked me in the ribs RIGHT under where Stevie boy's knee is.  CRACK.. 2 ribs busted!<br>
<br>
That's it as far as myself.  I've broken a few noses, cracked one jaw (not broken), and broke a thief's arm by hyperextending his elbow.  I thought he was a good friend, but was stealing from me.  I can't ABIDE thieves.<br>
