It's like this: I work in a sporting goods store.  Say a customer brings back a set of shoes that they bought the day before, and the soles are now coming off.  The customer asks to exchange the shoes for a new set.  Rather than examine the shoes to see if the damage is due to a defect, I tell him &quot;Well, I'm sorry your shoes came apart but you need to experience every nuance of the sporting goods store.  Sorry.&quot;  If this was you, wouldn't you be pissed?  Zland's a tough mob, he spawns once a week, and for a dragon friendly guild he's the only way to get the key.  Even if they can't reimburse people for it, I don't think it's unreasonable to expect a bit more tolerance from them.  It's not like he told the guy to fuck off.<br>

Uh yeah but we have paid for 2 expansions.  What is it, $20 or $30 for each? They get another 4 months+ revenue for us buying the expansion packs.  If they don't have enough GM's it's not a funding problem.

  I buzzed through the log and what stuck out in my mind is that the Guide told Aeolwind that he does, &quot;not have the right to ask this be escalated.&quot;<br>
<br>
  Heh, that's hilarious.  While that might be true, you don't tell a customer that because of the rage it produces.  It's akin to saying, &quot;Nope, I won't get my advisor and you can't make me nha hah.&quot;  Advisors and Managers exist in a CS Structure as fallbacks where you send irrate customers to.  They recieve their positions due to innate skill in CS.<br>
<br>
  Additionally, managers have greater facilities (ie, a guide couldn't return the item anyway, he lacks the tools, while a GM does).  It is comforting to a customer to understand that they are speaking with someone who *can* fix the problem if they state their position carefully.<br>
<br>
  You gotta love the way the guides/gms use their &quot;faceless&quot; power in EQ, when I can promise if Aeolwind was visiting their offices, creating a stir in the midst of other paying customers that he would recieve better service.<br>

Having to do that quest all over again because of a glitch Verant should have taken care of in the first place would tick anyone off. He shouldn't have said some of the things he said to that guide, and the guide was doing his job, but the guide should have expected Aeol to be upset, it's obvious that guide has no clue as to what that quest entails or he would have understood why Aeol got so angry. Besides Aeol said that a report was filed with a GM and when he told the guide about it the guide said that he isn't allowed to look at it. Why is Aeol having to deal with a person who has no clue what is going on and doesn't have the access to read a report of the incident in the first place? If something like this ever happened to me and I petitioned and only got a guide to respond, I'd say never mind and lump it. <p><b>Loyal Paladin follower of Erollisi Marr.

Mark the petition for review by the senior or the GM and move on. If manaroa was a senior then he should have stopped at the point when Wind asked for the GM and marked the petition for review by the GM. In either case, a guide or senior guide has no powers to return the item. They simply both will end up escalating the petition to the GM. <br>
<br>
A GM is the only one with the capability to give an item back. The GM should have spoken with Aeolwind, not the guide, and they could have worked on the situation. <br>
<br>
Possibly funny anecdote:<br>
<br>
You pull up to jiffyburger and order a hamburger and fries. You pay at the window and get your bag of food, in which you find no hamburger and fries after you have left the window. You drive back and tell the drivethru clerk you want your food. He turns to someone in the kitchen you can't see, asks a question you can't quite hear, then turns back and tells you that since you drove off they can't give you your food. The receipt says it was in the bag hence it must be your fault. You get mad and ask for the manager. The drive-thru guy repeats the turn around question then tells you no, sorry. You get mad and ask for the manager, the clerk says no the issue is closed. You curse the clerk, jiffyburger, and the gods of creation, but the clerk still says no and has the audacity to tell you that getting mad will solve nothing.<br>
<br>
Do you...<br>
<br>
A. Drive on and attempt to be one with the situation, as the great Joe P. always said &quot;They F*ck you at the drive-thru&quot;.<br>
B. Pull around front, get out of the vehicle, pull on your ass-kicking boots, and proceed to put your request to see the manager in a different light.<br>

<br>
I feel for Aeolwind, but I can't be 100% sympathetic. Personally, an Quest worth a damn that I ever did, I took plenty of time before handing the item in, making sure I had exactly the right things. I made sure I had a slot free and I made sure that there was nothing on my cursor, or anything else that might somehow affect the quest.<br>
<br>
Something like that, I probably would have sat there for ten minutes checking things before going for it, and I sure as hell would have taken the time to put my JBoots into a bag before I did it.<br>
<br>
Im sorry it happened Aeol, and it REALLY sucks that you didnt get the key. But you should always take every procaution before doing this kind of quest.<br>

The Sleepers Tomb key, as Hothgar said(and I know, because I have one), appears in any open slot, primary or container. Aeol had an open inventory slot and, I assume open container slots, yet he was denied because something was on his cursor? That doesn’t make any sense, the quest reward wasn’t going to the cursor.<br>
<br>
To give you an example of things to account for, here’s an excerpt from the Ragebringer quest…<br>
<br>
<I>– If Stanos is not in the camp then give Anson McBale "Stanos' Pouch" you received from Malka Rale to spawn him. (Be sure to stand on the table behind Anson when giving him "Stanos' Pouch" or Stanos may not spawn - this happens because you may be standing on Stanos' spawn point)</I><br>
<br>
Pay special attention to the “Be sure to stand on the table…” part. All quests should be dummy proof, written as if there are no such things as spoilers telling you where to stand or what not to do. Imagine if you were the first Rogue trying to spawn this guy and nothing worked… all because you were standing on a spawn point and had no idea. Think even further past and imagine if this was a pinnacle part of the quest and you have to hand in an uber rare item that took you 100 hours to get, then the guy instantly despawned all because you were standing in the wrong place.<br>
<br>
The fact that they wrote up a few lines in some document stating that they wont replace quest items is pretty fucked up, to say the least. If its player error then I'm all for not replacing anything, if you hand in the wrong shit you deserve to get boned. But when you do a quest legitimately and are denied the end result, not because of your own fault but because of inconsistent programming, you deserve a reimbursal. <p><b>Vendrix</b><br>

[Wed Jun 20 19:01:50 2001] Total time playing Aeolwind: 187 days, 2 hours, and 28 minutes.<br>
<br>
For a turnin of that magnitude, Eldritch nailed it:<br>
<br>
[Wed Jun 20 19:32:56 2001] Eldritch tells the guild, 'how did you manage to have jboots on your cursor when hitting trade aeol?'<br>
<br>
It may or may not be EQ-CS policy to shoot down reimbursements for pooched turnins when you have something on your cursor, but if there's one thing epic quests should have taught everyone, it's that turnins of any magnitude need to have the proper respect shown.<br>
<br>
You're in this position because you didn't, and with 187 days played, you should have known better; hence the Central Park jogger analogy.  For the record, I'd still give the necklace back, if it can be proved via logs that you had it before the turnin and didn't have it afterwards.  For making this comment, <br>

In closing, I am going to talk to George Scotto at VI.  Screw the middle men, he is the one that said nyllith should get his epic back when everyone else told him to EAD.  <br>

Valtron's EMail<br>

I've read through the log that you've sent to me and I have a few comments<br>
to make in regards to this issue. First off, I will send this log to the new<br>
server GM to be looked into, you can do the same as well. Please contact<br>
Travis Wigglesworth, Twigglesworth@station.sony.com, to get further<br>
assistance. I will give my personal views to this matter. Since I am no<br>
longer the GM I no longer have any 'say' with regards to Customer Service<br>
issues at all. So the decision that the GM comes up with will be what you<br>
have to live with.<br>
<br>
What you experienced would be considered a bug. At least in my eyes it<br>
would. If you gave an NPC an item, that he was expecting to receive, and you<br>
did have an "Open Inventory" slot you should've been given the item in<br>
return. I have already checked into the matter and it appears that you gave<br>
the NPC in question the Zlandicar's Talisman. I'll send the logs that I have<br>
to the Server GM.<br>

Aeolwind:  What a bonehead play dude.  You've got more than 4 times the played time I've got, and even I knew you shouldn't have stuff on your cursor when you traded with an NPC.  I hope the new GM helps you, but you fooked up man. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uarikel.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Arikel</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 1253<br> <font color=#E9D756>(6/23/01 2:02:43 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Can't say I agree with your police work 100%.</span><hr size=1> Actually, if you read that email from Valtron it doesn't matter if stuff is on your cursor.
