<br>
I know it was very hard for me to discuss things with Lando when he held the belief I/we had lied. Not to mention his faulty notion that I had just ported in. <br>
<br>
As to previous wrong doings by members of LoF, I have no knowledge, being new to the guild myself, but you can believe I expect no such behavior in the future.<br>

 Ive raided with Affliction quite a few times. i learned some great pull tactics from (sorry i borrowed, but i give credit where credit is due) their older monks, they have a great history.<br>
<br>
Yah ive seen a few d00ds with the Affliction tag in the last few months but id say an overwhelming amount of their members are still top notch.<br>
<br>
This situation doesnt sound like anything Affliction would knowingly do. The original poster's story is far from clear. At best you could say there was a lack of communication, plus the deception by the LoF people telling them they were headiing to Hate when they too were headed to Sky didnt make things better.  If yall knew they were heading to Sky why didnt ya say you had people up there already? hello McFly!<br>

Kiss, make up and next time talk things out a little better.<br>

Considering some of the things I have heard about Magister and their &quot;might makes right&quot; ideas in the past, I wouldn't be talking if I were you (no offense to the countless friends I have in Magister that don't act like morons, but you know you have a few in the guild that should keep their mouths shut).  I read the list of &quot;disreputibles&quot; or whatever Nick called our people, and there is no one on that list who would ever strong arm anyone into leaving PoA, especially considering it aint a fuckin big deal for us to leave and come back later in the day, which we did anyway as I saw when I logged on at 9:30pm EST. As for Affliction being compared to UI, go get a fuckin clue Sark.  If you want to compare Affliction to someone, compare us to your daddy, cause we could beat you every night and never work up a sweat or think twice about it just like him.  I have a couple friends in UI, but the make-up of their guild is completely different from the make-up of Affliction.<br>
<br>
Whether or not this happened in the drug induced halucinations of members of LoF or not is not the question, hell it may well have, but when we step back into reality, it just isn't plausible. We (read Affliction) have had zones ganked from us (from guilds/pickup raids/dipshits who felt it was their right to show up and train us out of zones), people move in on our raids (lack of communication is a bitch, but we always worked it out in the end), and stepped back when someone planned a raid to start even a few minutes before ours (hell, we have helped those raids get established and left them to do their thing when they needed help, and even CRed a couple when things went bad), so to say that we would gank anyone else is just, to put it bluntly, stupidity of the highest caliber. If 4 of our members say they saw one of your members say you were going to HATE, then they saw it, I have never known a member of my guild to lie before, and I ain't going to take the word of people I don't know over people I know to be honorable. As far as I am concerned, even if one of LoF's members said they were going to HATE as a &quot;joke,&quot; others sitting at the portal in Sro should have opened their big ass mouths and said something to the effect that it was a joke and mentioned where they were REALLY going, instead of fuckin around with people who had a destination they were freely admitting in /say and causing a clusterfuck that could have been avoided. This also would have directed the loud mouths to HELPING the situation, instead of WHINING about it afterwards. Sorry, but I lose respect for people when I hear that they have acted like a 12 year old who's billionairre daddy has refused to buy them their 90th personal amusement park.  I have no doubt in my mind that our officers would have spent the time and even the guildfunds to satisfy you if your demands weren't outlandish and bratty.  <br>

When you and your guildmates responded with attacks on LoF, those attacks were opened for public comment.  Telling me to mind my own business and to keep my nose out of this is sort of ludicrous under those circumstances.  And I note that you didn't say the same thing to the people who posted in support of your guild.<br>
<br>
Okay, so now you're saying that LoF misled you.  Once again, no one has ever come up with an explanation for why LoF would be motivated to do that.  No one is suggesting that LoF decided to go to Sky only after they found out that Affliction was planning to go there.  That would be absurd.  What was LoF going to gain by making you think they were going to Hate?<br>
<br>
At worst, this sounds like a miscommunication.  Either you misunderstood what the LoFer was saying, or the LoFer got confused and said &quot;Hate&quot; instead of &quot;Sky.&quot;  Either way, it was probably an innocent mistake on someone's part.<br>
<br>
But that really isn't the problem here.  Once you got to Sky, you knew that there were LoF people already there.  Lando admits it.  You had to know there was a problem, unless you thought the LoFers accidentally TPed to Sky instead of Hate.  LoF says that they told you that the plane was taken, and I don't see anyone from Affliction denying that.<br>
<br>
LoF says that Affliction hauled off and started killing fairies, rather than discussing the situation.  Your first post in this thread pretty well admits that.  Once Affliction started killing fairies, LoF retaliated by killing fairies, and the cluster fuck began.<br>
<br>
So my question to you is this -- why did Affliction start killing fairies without trying to work the situation out first?  The only explanation that makes sense is that some of your members wanted to foreclose any argument over who was going to get the plane.  If they took all of the keys -- or even most of the keys -- LoF was screwed.<br>
<br>
I'd really like to hear your answer to that question.  In all other respects, Affliction's actions seem to be entirely justifiable.  As you are well aware, I am not an Affliction basher.  Just the same, it sounds like some of your members used poor judgment when they started killing fairies. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ujaromir.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Jaromir</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 70<br> <font color=#E9D756>(9/29/01 9:48:49 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> ...</span><hr size=1> Kelewala and Ruler - <br>

<br>
That was my point.<br>

I guess you must be the expert on everyones raiding styles and know everything so that you can comment on a guild that you have never raided with. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/udamornfateseeker.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Damorn Fateseeker</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 402<br> <font color=#E9D756>(9/29/01 10:06:41 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: a joke?</span><hr size=1> ya, purifyre grats shazanti our newest Kvack <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><IMG SRC=http://damornwashere.homestead.com/files/Sig_2.jpg></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uoakendalefw.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Oakendale FW</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 59<br> <font color=#E9D756>(9/29/01 10:10:01 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: a joke?</span><hr size=1> Interesting Post Sarkam comming from someone with no playskill whatsoever.

<br>
Chuk, I think Lumpy was saying he hated Da`Kor, and Magister is even worse <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  He's not sucking up to them in the slightest.<br>
<br>
And Sage, if that's really how it happened, and if LoF really had 29 people up there when we ported up our first group as Nickoli states, why would it turn into a clusterfuck at all? They would've simply killed all the other fairies on the island while we were doing that instead of fighting for them. You wanna know why they didn't? Because HE WAS LYING. When did Affliction port up all these groups to kill all the fairies, in such a manner that we got all but one of them? (Again, not our 1 group vs 29 LoF as they state.) While we spent that hour talking to them that they say never occured. MORE LYING. <br>
<br>
You know why they only got 1 fairie (did they even get that one fairie)? Because they didn't have all those people up there, the people that WERE there were the ones that ported up there and that we saw in Sro when we were (mistakenly or not) led to believe that they were going to Hate. We didn't see the scads of people camped up there from &quot;last night's raid&quot;. The guild that was there last night didn't see any evidence of their &quot;last night's raid&quot; either. Maybe they went up, in a short amount of time that nobody noticed or saw them. But they weren't showing in Sky today, because we've seen people ahead of us in planes plenty of times before and we've always backed off and done something else, and would have had no problem doing it today. But if they weren't showing in Sky and nobody saw them there last night, and nobody saw them there this morning when we got up there.. guess what, camping in the plane don't mean jack shit under those circumstances. <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> I am also not saddened to hear your rape of PoA was a failure.

<br>
Last I checked he and all his level 60 twinks have thier epics....<br>
<br>
So if he is greedy it must be because he wanted to help his <br>
guild...hmm maybe not so greedy.<br>
<br>
I still think the give us your VS is one of the funniest things I <br>
have read this year.  <br>
<br>
As to the WTC thing I would say pulling together and being <br>
nice to each other is a good thing but generalizing and acting <br>
like everyone that plays EQ is an American is just silly. A <br>
terrible thing happened but this is a game we play to escape <br>
from the real world.  <br>
<br>
Landario is a nice guy.  He did try to talk to your people. They<br>
even made a group of officers to talk about it.  Sounds me to <br>
like they tried which you don't give them credit for in the first <br>
post.  You didn't know that they were talking because they <br>
were trying to work it out like adults.  I would suggest you get<br>
the facts before you come and flame an entire group of people.<br>
You just logged off pissed without the facts and came here <br>
and whined like a baby who had been denied thier toy.  <br>
Someone from SF even said that PoA can be shared. It sounds<br>
to me like your guild was more the guild that was unwilling to <br>
work something out. <br>
<br>
All that aside I must thank everyone involved for at least there<br>
was one real rant this week.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showMessageRange?topicID=2469.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showMessageRange?topicID=2469.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showMessageRange?topicID=2469.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a> <b>4</b> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showMessageRange?topicID=2469.topic&start=81&stop=100>5</a><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showMessageRange?topicID=2469.topic&start=101&stop=120>6</a><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showMessageRange?topicID=2469.topic&start=121&stop=140>7</a><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showMessageRange?topicID=2469.topic&start=141&stop=160>8</a><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showMessageRange?topicID=2469.topic&start=161&stop=180>9</a><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showMessageRange?topicID=2469.topic&start=181&stop=191>10</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showMessage?topicID=2478.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showMessage?topicID=2481.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.emailToFriend?topicID=2469.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.threadControl?topicID=2469.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/deleteThreadFire.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=2469.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=2469.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub4.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="emarrmessageboardrules">Message Board Rules<option value="emarrlinks">Links<option value="emarrupcomingmmorpgs">Upcoming MMOG's<option value="emarrfrm16">The Emarr Quadrant<option value="emarrfrm18">America Under Attack<option value="emarrfrm19">Dark Age of Camelot<option value="emarrgeneral">General<option value="emarrfrm17">Funny Stuff<option value="emarrbazaar">Item Bazaar<option value="emarrscrollsnspells">Spell Bazaar<option value="emarrfrm15">Shiny Things<option value="emarrfrm14">Bargain Basement<option value="emarrdragonsandplanes">Rants and Flames<option value="emarrfrm13">Dragons and Planes<option value="emarrroleplaying">Roleplaying<option value="emarrroleplayingoocforum">Roleplaying - OOC Forum<option value="emarrscammeralert">Scammer Alert<option value="emarrsignaturecorner">Test Forum<option value="emarrreallife">Real Life<option value="emarrothermmorpgs">Other MMOG's</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#E9D756>- </font><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/bemarr>Erollisi Marr, The Queen of Love</a><font color=#E9D756> - </font><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes>Rants and Flames</a> <font color=#E9D756> - </font><br><br> <br>
