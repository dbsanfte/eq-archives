She replies you dont need to tell ME what to do I have been on more dragon raids then all of you combined.  I reply Yeah,  it really hurts to make sure everyone in the group knows where to put the CR and MR buffs when we get to that stage<br><br>Example 2: As soon as we moved to the buffing area Gabriele says DO NOT USE FIRE as a fake buff,  and do NOT begin buffing yet.  Of course Anevas begins to fake buff the group.  Gabriele shouts if you are buffing early before i have said to start then its your own fault because your group will die.  Anevas continues to buff.  Of course Anevas did use fire as a fake buff.  <br><br>Example 3:  1 Group member gets  6 SIX fake buffs.  Gabriele shouts: DO NOT GET MORE THAN 4 FAKE BUFFS (about 4 times in a row)  Group member says Dispell me please.  The group member is dispelled and gets new fakes. He asks, &quot;Can I get cleric buffs please ?&quot;  Anevas says, &quot;No,  I told you not to dispell there is no such thing as too many fake buffs your a waste of my time.&quot;  Group yells at her she so she suddenly leaves the group (This is 5 minutes before the actual fight with Vox).<br><br>Example 4:  She has extreme problems with social interactions, when I explained to her the only problem is that A: She refuses to listen to directions from the RAID LEADER and B: It would all work out if she just cooperated with the group, She responds Look I dont work with you no name people who dont know what the fuck your doing.  I have had multiple 50+ characters and been to more dragon raids than you will ever see.  <br><br>In conclusion:  To Savena,  I dont give a shit what your past experiences are,  you aren't the goddamn leader on this raid and you DONT do your OWN THING.  You do what you are told,  you agreed to follow the directions of the raid leader when you signed up.  <br>A.  You buffed before you were supposed to buff <br>B.  You used fire resistances as a buff <br>C.  You abandoned the group when a group member who was FOLLOWING RAID LEADER DIRECTIONS dispelled and requested new buffs.<br><br>I tell her, &quot;I am going to talk to my guild about blacklisting you,  Bears of Oboo has already blacklisted you,  Avatars of night has already blacklisted you, and Ryogahibiki will speak to your guild leader.  &quot;<br><br>She responds, &quot; I dont care what you &quot;little&quot; guilds think, you dont matter.  Now stop telling me. &quot;<br><br>After she says stop telling me she of course sent me another tell so she could get the last word,  I ignored her.  <br><br>To Gabriele:  I&quot;m dissapointed in you for allowing her to stay on the raid.  A.  She broke MANY of your rules B.  She abandoned a group and refused to co-operate with group members in FOLLOWING your directions.  And YES everyone but the shaman and I died,  however if the buffs were done properly I am willing to bet none of us would have died.<br><br>To Savena:  You have some real problems with listening to what the raid leader is saying,  you did MANY things against what the raid leader has said because you think that you have some sort of &quot;right&quot; to do your own goddamn thing.  I dont give a shit what you think is right,  you do what the raid leader says.  <br><br>To Eclipse of Norrath:  I am shocked that a member of a guild comprised of many people with excellent reputations would go as far to insult three other guilds.  This member of yours has shown to be untrustworthy in following SIMPLE directions,  and will refuse to co-operate because her ego is too damn big. <br><br>/rude Savena <p><img SRC="http://www.geocities.com/diezzal99/Jed.jpg" height=206 weidth=432> </p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ujustanotherplaya.showPublicProfile?language=EN>JustAnotherPlaya</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>p0\/\/3r-p0sT3r!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(1/12/01 1:49:14 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=367.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Savena - Alternate Character : Anevas</span><hr size=1> Heh,<br><br>This is something i find in a LOT of people.

I feel that Gabriele's decision in letting Anevas was perhaps the wronge choice,  but thats a perhaps,  the fact of the matter is is that Gabriele is the raid leader and what she does is law,  I agreed to that when I signed up to the raid. <p><img SRC="http://www.geocities.com/diezzal99/Jed.jpg" height=206 weidth=432> </p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ujedakaskywalker.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Jedaka Skywalker</A> at: 1/12/01 6:55:24 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ujedakaskywalker.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Jedaka Skywalker</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>n00b!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(1/12/01 6:59:11 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=367.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: your a fool</span><hr size=1> BTW Nibl,  I was also a member of Heart of the Phoenix and I remembered when Savena unguilded to join Soul Assassins,  which she was kicked out of.  <br><br>BTW Hey genius,  I'm not the one that got six fake buffs.

I have contemplated about this Post all day long, I first saw it when there were only about 5 post's and now it has gotten a little out of hand I think.  I am sorry that I did not post earlier.  If I have any bad typos, or seem a little groogy or come off wrong I am sorry it is due to being very tired and having to work in 5 hours and I haven't went to bed yet.  So if you dislike anything I say please reread the article to make sure you understood the statement correctly.  Now to wake up and figure out where to start.<br><br>Ok Since everyone seems to not have a single clue as to why I say no Fire Resist as a Fake buff, it is this.  There are at Least Two classes that have an Elemental Sheilding Buff, Magician and Wizard that I know of, that does not stack with Resist Fire, it does stack with Resist Cold.  It gives those Casters another 20 or more Cold Resistant, and Fire too, but I am not worried about the Fire becuase we are about to Fight Vox Here.  I am sorry I don't know the Exact amount more CR it gives, but every last bit of CR count's with Vox.  To Point out again this Buff stack's with Resist Cold, but does not Stack with Resist Fire.  Anevas I spelled that out very well at the Raid and I don't know why you couldn't understand that, No I did not Want Fire as a Real Buff, how Absurd.  And I spelled out what Real Buff's everyone are to have too.  The Buffing stage goes much smoother and quicker when you try and generalize everyone's Buff's, rather than saying &quot;Ok Do not give Resist Fire to Mage's and Wizard's but give it to everyone else&quot;  there are alot of other examples, Necro's oh my gosh, the thing's they don't want is to long to list, thing's that interfere.  In some cases you need to just deal with the interference, but when it come's to CR and going up against Vox, I would rather just find another Fake so they can have that extra CR.<br><br>Let's see Anevas From your post, you make it sound like you know exactly what you are doing and that I did not.  Let me point something out to you.  I have lead 5 Raid's in my Career of leading Raid's so Far, all on Vox, the First three Raid's were unsucessful, both of the Last Two I have Lead a Victorius Raid.  I consider the First Three learning Experience's, along with the Last Two.  I attented Six Failed attempt's on Vox before leading one of my own, Leader's of those were, Sorry guy's not trying to redeem you or anything, Xkhanx, Gtath, Sivakk a couple of time's, and Leolan.  All of which Failed in the Last several Month's Vox Has died very few time's and there have been alot of unsucessful raid's.  Leader's who have Defeated her in the Last 5 or so Month's are, Xkhanx some time ago, Soul Assasins Twinks some time ago, Leolan some time ago, and Jedaka on Dec 30th.  Now I ask you do I really not know what the Heck I am doing, I tell you NO, I do know what the Heck I am doing or I couldn't have Lead Two Successful Raid's in a Row where so many Other's have Failed so many Time's as of Recently, and these People that lead the Raid's that failed New what they were doing.  So I defineately Knew what I was doing.<br><br>I must admit I am a little dissapointed that Jedaka Made this Thread and Shitlisted Savena/Anevas without speaking to me about it and seeing what else I could do to work it out, whether with Anevas or Eclipse of Norrath.  This makes me a little in a bind as to whether this should be on the shit list or not, it should have been talked about before hand, but it does have many shit list Merit's.<br><br>I would not Judge anyone do to what guild they are in, or were in, only by there actions alone.  To judge someone do to there Guilding is WRONG, and I would and will never do that.  I may be a little hesitant if I have had Problems with every member of that guild I had ever met.  This does not mean 1 person this mean's three or more, each time I have a bad experience with a member  of a guild that I would fell more and more discomfort about the guild, but would not ever brand the person from that guild until they proved themselve to be the same or different from there guild mate's.<br><br>Jedaka I am very dissapointed that you took something I said to you in a personal tell and posted it on the board for everyone to see without asking me.  No I do not take it back nor am I ashamed of what I said &quot;that I wouldn't take Anevas on anymore of my raid's till she proved herself able to follow my Directions.&quot;  This does hold True, I will team with Anevas in Regular team situations, that is if she would or will ever team with me again after this statement came out for all of Lanys to see and I wasn't the one to post it and am now having to patch it up.  Rather this statement should have been made in Game from me to Anevas before it was posted here.<br><br>To many Fakes and No Real's Make's everyone Dead and Lady Vox Alive, that mean's you don't get a shot at the Loot you and everyone else want so bad, instead you get a long CR period and a loss of some Exp.  Not enough Fake's is Bad becuase if she Take's away the Warrior's Hp's or AC, that is bad, or if she Strip's off everyone's CR and MR that is REAL BAD.<br><br>Ok a little harsher comment's I would like to refrain from posting, but I should probably touch basis on.  To Anevas and Jedaka take some time before you make post's on the Shit List you two, whether starting a Thread or just Replying.  You need to take time to clear your head and make well thought out comment's that don't hurt yourself.  Jedaka cussing alot does not help your post's.  Anevas well calling someone a Fool so many time's in such a short post, it really helps to prove Jedaka's points.<br><br>I really would rather not have to go into this, but reason's this should be here on the Shit List.  So that Raid Leader's can take not of people like this that wont' follow directions, so that they can know whether they want them on there raid or not.  Whether or not there raid is well equiped enough or not to have a possible person not listening that could possible ruin the whole raid.<br><br>Jedaka we were only a couple min off from fighting Vox at this time and we needed to move quickly before the two 24 min spawns spawned and before buff's started fading, we were on a time limit and I did not have time to kick a person out or fully deal with a multiple long conversations.  The move had to be done quickly and Vox killed or else we would have been in a bind, there were people that needed to leave shortly that I promised it would be a quick raid, that if everyone showed up on time it could be done in two hours and we did it in about an hour and a half, and we needed to move or we would have lost more than one raider if we had, had to hold back for some more giant's or rebuffing, you were one of those people on a tight time frame.  The situation could then easily be dealed with afterward's, and I had talked with Anevas before we moved and before I gave her a new group assignment and made sure I wouldn't have anymore problem's with her.  Yes do to another extremely unfortunate situation which involded a GM, I was very busy and was unable to talk to Anevas afterwards.<br><br>Wow this is long, well time for me to go to bed now, I work in 4 hour's.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br><br>Edited for Content, Statement's I said about Anevas's Post about SP, Grammer, and the such.
