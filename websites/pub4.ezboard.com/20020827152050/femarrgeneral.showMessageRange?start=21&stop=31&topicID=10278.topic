<br>
Unbreakable was a good movie, but only because the main character was so human, but also 100% predictable.<br>
<br>
M.Sharmalayn is a really bad writer and gets stuck on the one gimmik film. If you know the gimmik, the film is boring. His style is sluggish and predictable. As a director, he has excellent vision, but his timing is off. His delays are frequently beyond tension building and into sleep inducing.<br>
<br>
Once you realize the main character in 6th sense is dead...the movie offers nothing.<br>
<br>
It sucks that this movie is being successful because it means that he is going to make another movie... and he is going to waste 6 months of some talented actors lives that they could have spent making a good movie.<br>

<br>
Saying his writing is 'one gimmick' is like saying &quot;take away the stealth fighter's secrecy, and you basically have a slow, poorly performing plane&quot;.   That's an oversimplification.   The gimmick is exactly what he's after, he makes no pretenses otherwise, and he does it well in comparison to the millions of other films that come that truly are predictable.   <br>
<br>
How many other writers dont even have gimmicks?  No, gimmicks arent necessarily mandatory, but he is able to nail it down for me.  Obviously, you are quick enough to have seen up his sleeves, but the vast majority of us were fooled and surprised.<br>
<br>
As to his pacing, I am not alone in likening it to Hitchcock.  Ebert and others have raved about his eerie use of silence and non-action to compel the viewer's imagination to frighten themsevles.   I really enjoyed the &quot;wait for it....wait for it&quot; aspect of it instead of being bashed repeatedly and blatantly with blood, internal organs, and convenient actions.  I appreciated his not assuming that I had an MTV attention span and had to be coddled.<br>
<br>
Before anyone jumps on the &quot;convenient&quot; remark, the discovery of the aliens' weakness to water was not accidental on the part of the characters.  Remember, the point of Mel Gibson's story to his brother is that either things are truly random, or things happen for a reason.    According to the story, the daughter was somehow 'made' to feel that way about the water so she would in fact leave those 'land mines' around to be discovered.<br>
<br>
Is it the best movie of the year and Mr. M. the best writer/director around? probably not.   But he is talented and I personally enjoy his style and story.    And no, I am not saying you are wrong, just saying I disagree with your opinion.<br>

<br>
IE. Dead guy can't figure out that he's dead despite the facts that the only person he talks to 'sees' dead people and that he had been fatally shot.<br>
<br>
SPOILER***dont read if you havent seen Signs<br>
IE. Preacher loses faith in god until he realizes that his wifes last words were advice for a future situation involving aliens, which are violently allergic to water, invading planet where 75% of the surface is water.<br>
<br>
I believe a good story involves sub-plots. It shouldnt take 90 minutes to drag one point out. Signs didnt have a single minor lot, It was totally linear. At the end of the film the relationships between his brother and him and his children and him was the same as it was at the beginning of the film. The only change was that he had his faith restored.<br>
<br>
None of the other characters have changes in their lives. Ray never feels forgiven, we don't know that the daughter no longer has problems with water after the second sip, the son is the same as far as we know, the brother is the same as well. <br>
<br>
There is the vague war of the worlds sub plot, but that is mirroring the main story so doesnt really count.<br>
<br>
Sure it might have some appeal to the pure suspense fan, but for anyone else it drags.<br>
<br>
The problem with taking a single point and dragging it out is that in the process of dragging it out you have to cover every possible detail of that problem, leaving the observer with nothing to contemplate and little to reminisce.<br>
<br>
Shaymalan is a weak writer. His only decent writing to date was Stuart Little. <br>
<br>
This guy has a great eye, but everything else about him as a writer/director is without talent.<br>

<br>
I thought the director did a good job with building the tension and he had some really good shots.  It's always nice to see directors doing less with more, one single green leg can be scary.<br>
<br>
If you liked the idea in the movie that there are no coincidences, that everything is a part of God's plan, I would highly recommend John Irving's <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> A Prayer for Owen Meany</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> which dealt with the same themes far better.

<br>
I guess what you are dissatisfied with are the unacceptable attempts at subplots.  Given your formula, the following one sentence plots can be made:<br>
<br>
citizen kane: money/power cant buy you happiness.<br>
<br>
godfather: i thought my father was stupid for doing whatever it took to protect his family and make a living; i was wrong.<br>
<br>
matrix/wizzard of oz: wake up dorothy, this isnt kansas.<br>
<br>
The SOMEWHAT smallish subplots of: <br>
Phoenix's redemption at always swinging away; to thine ownself be true. <br>
a boy's realization that his father is someone to be admired; parents are people too.<br>
Phoenix's plea for Gibson to return to being the 'rock' that he so desperately needed; where have all the heros gone.<br>
this is also played out by the townpeople who are reluctant to give up on Gibson as a religious leader...at a time when they need to believe the most.<br>
<br>
The subplots are there.  Small in scope maybe, but that is also an artistic statement.   One thing that has bothered me since Pulp Fiction is the silly notion of introducing disjointed subplots, and the weirder the better, is 'artsy' and true cinema.   <br>
<br>
Pulp Fiction pulled it off...but none of the clones have.  Just because something is different and unexpected does not make it good.   In fact, the mark of a really good artist, be they actor, director or writer, is to take a familiar subject, and present it in a way that captivates its audience even when they know what's coming.<br>
<br>
A Rebel X-Wing fighter coming in at the last second to save the hero would not have made Saving Private Ryan nor Glitter better movies.  It would have been bizzare and unexpected...but totally stupid.<br>

I am sure there are people out there who can be entertained by this drivel. I am not one of them and will seek to convert all of you so that the next time he makes a movie no one will go to see it and he wont waste the time of actors who could be making something worthwhile.<br>
<br>
I dont think anyone is wrong for liking the film...i just think the movie sucked.<br>
<br>
Some people think movies are about being artistic and making a statement. I think there is a place for movies like this. University theatres and artistic movie houses.<br>
<br>
Sure he builds suspense with music and timing but he is not the best at it. He just studied hitchcock and took it one step further, one step too far. Hitchcock by the way had subplots, small connected stories that in their resolution contribute to the resolution of the main plot.'<br>
<br>
I personally think a movie should be entertainment. You should leave the theater thinking 'wow'. With Signs its more of an 'oh'. <br>
