YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>This is your last chance - do not go further if you want this to be spoiled.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>The Amy Temple.  How so often this place doesn't get pulled.  It is a shame really - due to the fact that it is the icing on the cake and then peeps can run about freely and even ZONE out.  What a better way to end a PoF raid (next to CT).<br><br>Generally the temple is pulled last (pending that CT is not up).  But I want everyone to know - that I am going to start pulling the temple after the west wall is broke.  That means from the SW corner to the NW corner and including the Tenticle Terrors and the Fetid house.<br><br>Why you ask?  Because people burn out by the end - but are willing to stay till the Phoboplasm (the Jello) cause of their lotto chance in getting something.  And - I think the pathing is better down the west wall then through the freakin GraveYard in the east.<br><br>THE SAFEST way to pull the temple is to have 2 peeps - but I am going to give you the solo version and let you modify to your own taste.  After all - if you don't do it yourself and FAIL - you wont know what to improve (thanks 00ber guilds - that try stuff first - you guys r0x0r)<br><br>What is needed?<br><br>One crazy and good necromancer.<br><br>Buff up fully - but leave a dang slot for Harmshield.  If you don't Harmshield (invulnerability for 12 secs) you will die on aggro of Amy Knights.  Laff - might as well be a DT.<br><br>So - make sure you get:<br><br>Sow<br>Regrowth/Chloro<br>Symbol<br>Cleric HP Buff<br>Cleric AC Buff<br>Resist Magic<br>Personal Shield (Arch Shielding)<br>Manaskin<br>DMF<br>C2<br>AGI (from shaman if available)<br>STA (from shaman if availble)<br><br>Um - that should be good enough - you don't need agi and sta - but they are nice.<br><br>Now - make your way near the firewall.  Don't go up to it yet ... hello KAPOW!!!!<br><br>Make sure chanters are set and raid party is ready.<br><br>NOTE - make up your mind that if you screw up you are going to die - don't even take the whole dang temple back to the raid party or even within aggro range.<br><br>OK - is your heart beating yet?  Your hands getting sweaty?  Good.<br><br>About 20 feet from the FW - Cast Harmshield - and RUN your butt off through the firewall and up the hill.  Kapow Kapow Kapow Kapow Kapow Kapow Kapow Kapow Kapow.  Yeah - be a good necro and EAT THEM harmtouches ...<br><br>Don't linger long - but piss off the whole temple - and eat as many as you can ... and head back down the hill to a safe spot.  Linger for a tiny moment - less you got the train on you.<br><br>NOTE - you have about 20 mobs aggro on you at a bare min.  You better be ready.<br><br>Now here is the problem.  Verant in their little pretty minds have the MoB placement oh so pretty inside that temple - BUT you know what - they don't walk out the freakin openings 90% of the time.  They do the normal 'i am going to run into this wall till I pop out and eat you'.<br><br>So what can happen is all the sudden you have 10 mobs on you at once.<br><br>When you see em coming - or if they warp on you - RUN FORREST RUN - and bring em to a further safer spot  -  kinda spreading them out in a line.  Now - Feign Death - and you BETTER be freaking successful or there wont be much of you left ... if not successful don't sit there and freeze - GET UP AND RUN.<br><br>Now - wait ... and watch them all path back to the temple.  (at this point if 2 peeps - the one sk or necro or monk that is FD can get up and peel when appropriate).  When not many are left - ie 1 or 2 - get up and RUN them back to the raid party.  Walla ... split.<br><br>Now - how does this whole thing work?<br><br>You can run outside of the AGGRO range of the mobs - thus the rest of the temple wont come - once back inside.<br><br>Now after the initial break - guess what?  Yes - YOU STILL HAVE AGGRO.<br><br>So throw your Manaskin back on and head back to the temple.  For the love of God - if you have a sound card turn it up so you can hear them coming.  BUT if not - just get near the temple and you will see them start to come ... (note - get up by the firewall ... and edge your way up ... till you get a couple or better yet just one.)<br><br>Because of the dumb pathing through the walls - you will almost 90%+ of the time only get 1 mob ... maybe 2.  Now it is clockwork - aggro through the wall - graba  mob or 2 and take it back to the raid party.  Rince - repeat.  Just FD if you get too many and wait for the peel.<br><br>I personally have taught a couple peeps how to do this - and I don't have to name names ... but they were from some of the more organized guilds.<br><br>What they taught me was that in their raids - they will aggro the temple - FD - and let the peeler start a train - and then have a 3rd person peel a couple from the back of the train as it is run in circles.  /shrug - I guess that is the LEAST sploiting way.<br><br>NOTE - until CQ got busted - I never really viewed how I did the temple as a sploit - it just MADE freakin sense since the dang mobs get stuck in the temple and you eat a kazillion HT - so you dont rush the stupid thing.  Now I consider what I do to probably be a sploit on VI's definitions.<br><br>So - I am thinking of how else to do it - but until then - I will do it the way I IMPROVISED and ADAPTED to do it - cause I had to figure it out (or wanted to).  I hope this has been helpful to you all ... and you can ask peeps that raid with me - it works.  Sure I have been chowed before - but imo it works.  And it is fun!<br><br>I know CC has some thoughts on this as well - as she has a monk and we had shared some thoughts together ... would be interested to see how others do it. <p><table border="0" width="350"><tr><td>"I am The Ancient, I am The Land.

If you're level 60, it is possible to move up to the temple and agro just a few Amys at a time, letting you survive the HTs without Harmshield or another DA type spell. Just one thing: VERY carefully... take one step too far and you're dead, and it doesn't seem to work from all directions. <br><br>The advantage of this is that with care the temple can be split even if you don't have a necro. However, it takes a lot longer as the puller has to be very careful, and will probably still die a few times even then - so a skilled necro definitely works best.<br><br>[Edit] I honestly would not consider the method described by Istrahd as an exploit. The mobs can still get to you, just by warping instead of running. If they had to actually run out of the temple it would be even easier to split than it is now when they warp, so I don't see a problem. All mobs, even in an open area, will usally string out in a line if you pull a large amount of them. <p>Ulaian Moonleaf <BR>-Warder <BR>Dark Whispers</p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uulaian.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ulaian</A> at: 1/21/02 8:57:12 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/unumruk.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Numruk</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.student.nada.kth.se/~md96-jma/eq/canada.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>h0x0r!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(1/21/02 11:58:10 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumnecromancer.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=542.topic&index=3>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www3.sympatico.ca/palad/smallskel.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I promised Neesha - Pulling PoF Temple Notes</span><hr size=1> AE fear is in nowadays.<br><br>I pulled amy temple two weeks ago, I just ran up HS along the wall and ran back down, a ranger peeled half the mobs off and a SK (kilot) peeled the other half and brought them back to the raid party.
