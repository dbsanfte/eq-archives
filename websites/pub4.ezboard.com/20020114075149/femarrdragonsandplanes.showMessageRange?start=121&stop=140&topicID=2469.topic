Which is exactly why, up until this point, that none of the other CBA members have brought this up.  If, in fact, Crom had told you, 'Yes, we have a problem with the way this was handled&quot; - How would that have made any difference?  It would have been an exercise in futility.<br>
<br>
The loot, in my eyes, was poorly handled.  Dragon raids have always been NBG not GBN when they are run by Crom or one of the other many pick-up raid leaders.  So how is a lvl 60 druid, who already has the Elaborate Scimitar, going to benefit from the Heiro Crook?  The one druid on that raid, Llaura, that could use it didn't get it.  I thought this was a horrible decision and I gave her mine.<br>
<br>
I entirely disagree that, &quot;LoF had been camping Ragefire for several days&quot;, when our raid started gathering.  I went into Sol B a couple hours prior to our scheduled raid to ensure no one else was there.  Guess what - there wasn't.  If memory serves, there was a total of 15ish people in zone around their mid-40s.  Camp check also did not reveal Nagafen or Rage being taken.  As I did not log or screenshot me doing this, I know it comes down to your word against mine. Either way, this is what happened as I saw it.<br>
<br>
So yes, it certainly did appear to VP &amp; CBA that you ported in and just marched right past us.  Yes, you did clear the giants before we had a chance to &amp; ran the buff line.  However the point is, as your guild seems to have made, &quot;We were there first&quot;.  You didn't respect our raid and personally I think its only fair karma that Affliction didn't respect yours.  What goes around, comes around.<br>
<br>
Regarding lava rocks...I will extend a thank you for gathering those. No sarcasm here in this thanks, I assure you they were most appreciated.<br>
<br>
My last point, Venril Sathir.  I recieved a tell regarding your /guildmotd just two days before the pick-up rotation in the VS spawn was to occur. I will concede, in order to get into the rotation you have to KS a spot already there.  However, where is the logic in KSing a Pick-Up raid?! The reason for the pick-up rotation is for those of us NOT in large or powerful enough guilds to take on VS ourselves.  Do I believe that LoF wasn't intending on KSing the pick-up rotation? No. My personal feelings in the matter and since the time has already passed, I doubt you can change my mind.<br>
<br>
Relations can always be repaired I think. Personally, I hope one day that will happen here. <p>Siilverain the Wind Caller<br>

<br>
I would like to start off with thanking you for your replies.  Both for making them, and for your civil and honourable comportment.<br>
<br>
I'm afraid that I neglected to mention something.<br>
<br>
There were tells.  Several of your people did try to make it right.  I even received some apologies.  In fairness, I think Toran was one of them.<br>
<br>
Please try to understand, on a person by person basis I have seen your people behave as nice as any other person I could ever hope to meet.<br>
<br>
The issue at hand is a concern on my part (and perhaps on the part of some others) to behave in the fashion of a streetgang when grouped together in force.<br>
<br>
Now mind you, I find this perfectly understandable.  There are both deplorable and beautiful things that a strong band of people joined in common cause can accomplish.  My concern here is that I have had cause to believe that when joined together in numbers, in exultation of conquest, a tendency exists on the part of many of your guild to behave as bad-ass toughguys.  And though there are some who in the privacy of tells do not agree or who empathize in fairness, the actions of the group say otherwise.<br>
<br>
This next statement is absolutely not intended to be inflammatory.  But it is an example close to home which I can cite with credibility.  There are guilds who, whether you meet one person or find an entire raid of them behave respectfully of others.  Consistently.  They do not change their ways or sense of honour when in large numbers and victorious.<br>
<br>
Should anyone find a member of Vivix Protectorate mistreat another in a way that is shameful to the guild or on blatant violation of Verant's rules, you may rest assured that I will welcome the knowledge of it and deal with it.  And this is the same for a 4 group raidparty as it is for a single member.<br>
<br>
And that is my point.  Honestly, I have every reason to believe that each of you and perhaps very many of your people are really really nice folks.  Probably even folks that I would wish be friends with.  Probably yourselves among them.<br>
<br>
But there have been occasions which, for whatever reason, be it lack of leadership or people management on the scene, &quot;one of those days&quot; where emotion ran high, a fluke of spawn, being tired of a long Ragefire camp, being one armor piece away from a full suit of Kunark armor, whatever it may be, your people when gathered in numbers have behaved as bullies insofar as they have shown blatant lack of respect for others.  More than once in my memory.<br>
<br>
Which does not take away the fact that as individuals they may not agree and may deplore unfairness.<br>
<br>
Nor does it change it.<br>
<br>
I did receive tells after the Nagafen raid.  I sincerely appreciated the candor and honour that inspired it.  But it didn't change the actions of the group.  Had that honour prevailed, and had the leadership of your people believed in that sense of honour and been strong about it, I don't think we would be having this discussion.<br>

Sorry if I didn't make that clear. Their name calling and fairy wacking turned what was a reasonable discussion with Lando into a FU session. <br>
<br>
Did Lando condone the fairy wacking and name calling ? I don't know. But he was rather obstinate. But that may have been because he honestly believed Affliction was there first and that we had lied about where we were going (boggle). <br>
<br>
Now if you had stayed up til 6am to get a key, then awakened 3 hours later, logged on to be greated by only your own guildmates, and then another guild arrived and started calling you a liar and killing the fairies, how would you react? <br>
<br>
Many of LoF wanted to start killing fairies when the name calling started, but instead we continued to try to explain to Lando that we had been there. To explain that we were not the people he saw on the platform. Noone wanted bad blood. We did not start killing because we wanted to avoid hard feelings.  <br>
<br>
Many of those people from Affliction I know to be honorable people, unfortunately a few assholes made what should have been a reasonable situation into this hate fest. <br>

<br>
Sir, you did send an apology.  I respect it and I wouldn't dream of taking that away from you.<br>
<br>
But I don't think calling Crombattleaxe an asshole helps any.<br>
<br>
If you'd have stated the rules up front, and left us our freedom to choose knowing the odds to stay or go, I wouldn't have mentioned a thing in this forum.<br>
<br>
&quot;Our raid, our rules, sorry friends&quot; I think would have been perfectly fair.  Maybe a bit impolite, but we could have run into each other at the bank one day and you could've said &quot;Hey Theo, was a wild raid, I didn't have the time or state of mind to be more eloquent about it&quot; and I'd have said &quot;np, I understand&quot;.<br>
<br>
If you'd have said &quot;You know, that raid was a lot of pressure.  I didn't keep the folks in line as well as I could, and I've learned since then&quot; I would applaud you and all would be forgotten.<br>
<br>
Can you understand, neither of our guilds has said anything about it.  Shit happens, you learn one way or the other.  If my ally had chosen to maintain that silence, I would have too.<br>
<br>
He chose the time and place to clear the air and put it out in the open, and I stand by them.<br>
<br>
As it was, we knew it was our own damned fault for staying.  If luck threw us bad dice, that's life.<br>
<br>
As it was, luck threw us good dice, but your people threw us last-minute made-up rules.  Do you understand sir, THAT is the grievance of the raid.<br>
<br>
Compounded by subsequent actions on your part to continue to show lack of regard for others (read &quot;us&quot;).  Do you understand, THAT is why we didn't say anything?  To speak openly against you for one bad night really would make us assholes.  We have cause to believe that what you did was not a fluke, was not an isolated case, was not a single bad night but one of a trend.<br>
<br>
Toran, for all I know you are a nice guy at heart who has taken umbrage at having his honour insulted.  Fair enough, and I'm sorry for that.  But can you see that the allegations at hand are not isolated and are full of proofs? <p>Théodwyn Riddermark, Disciple of Quellious<BR>

Theodwyn I still have not seen you show me anything that confirms that what happened with Nag is the way we do things. You showed me the post regarding VS but we did not go for VS after it became known that it was a different pickup raids turn(we thought it was the turn of the pickup raid that was lead by two of our members),but either way we did not down VS on anyones turn less you wish to count the pickup raid that was lead by two of our members and had many more of our members plus guild allys. <p><img SRC="http://www.lof.ukhq.co.uk/sigs/alek.jpg"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uractervargun.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Racter Vargun</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 108<br> <font color=#E9D756>(9/30/01 10:17:51 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: street punks</span><hr size=1> If Sarkam can, I can!  <br>

On a serious note...there is no right answer. Not everything is black and white...this is one of those cases. <br>
It basically boils down to LoF made Aff mad, Aff made LoF mad, and I believe Stumpf said it best, &quot;It was a clusterfuck.&quot; Both parties made an error in judgement, and kaboom! The biggest error I can see is from Nickoli, for bringing this here. I believe Bejita said it best this time, &quot;r&amp;f is just too angry.&quot; And quite frankly, angry people don't think rationally. <br>
<br>

I have been unable to find my logs (from which you could have gathered your own conclusions).  I did not take screenshots.<br>
<br>
Regarding the behaviour displayed on that occasion, I'm afraid you will have to take my word on it or not.  Either way, I understand.<br>
<br>
The VS incident, as you stated, did not happen.  But from the post which is linked, you can gather for yourself the wording and the intent displayed.<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>
Théodwyn<br>

When it became obvious Afliction didnt accept the fact we were there first, I suggested a random. What would you have done? Bullies don't amuse me. And yes, those people who called me a liar and started killing fairies were SoBs.<br>
