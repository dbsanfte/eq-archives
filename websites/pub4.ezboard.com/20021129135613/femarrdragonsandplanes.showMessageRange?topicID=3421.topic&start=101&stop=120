You can stay, leave, go to hell and sit on a hot coal... I dont care.  In this case, you are simply wrong.  Toxx was far from the first to say something.  I think it is you who should reread this thread.  <br>
<br>
First, not once have I heard him sound remoreseful for what he did.  He is sorry for people getting pissed about it.  Every time he posts, all he does is defend his actions.. which there isn't any defense for.  From the sounds of it, this is far from the first time this has happened.  If previous posts are true, he even got booted from a previous guild for the exact same actions.  To me that says he knew how wrong it was and continued to do it anyways, not that he learned his lesson and is sorry in the least.<br>
<br>
You coming to his defense apparently without reading all the posts isn't a good way to conduct yourself.  Personally, I think you made that post just to stir up more angst here.  Your post was so obviously out of whack with the reality of the situation that you were asked to just go back to AB,  which I'll admit happens fairly often.  With posts like yours here I am not surprised.  Again, thats my simple opinion.  At this point, you felt the need to post a pic of some character you have here, for the sole purpose of having an excuse to post on these boards I'm sure.  As you did this you knew it was going to start an ensueing battle and you sit back to watch the sparks fly.  <br>
<br>
If you want to be the center of attention to feel important.. or whatever the reason you continue to come here (I truly dont care), have at it.  What you shouldn't do is take a serious topic like the one people were discussing here and take it the route it went.  By responding to you here, I'm simply making the point known (and contributing to the problem). Because of this, I will not be addressing you in this thread again.  If you want to converse about why I've posted this, feel free to start another thread and I'll go into it in detail.  Let's try and let this end the off-topic route this thread took.  You can start another if you want to continue  bickering. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uk1ssk1ng.showPublicProfile?language=EN>K1SSK1nG</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 960<br> <font color=#E9D756>(6/22/02 8:21:51 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3421.topic&index=103>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: !</span><hr size=1> it was me who hijacked the thread really.

<br>
‘’Toxx was far from the first to say something. I think it is you who should reread this thread.’’<br>
<br>
<br>
Please point me to the post where I said he was the only one?  I’ll just wait here till you find that particular post……….<br>
<br>
<br>
‘’You coming to his defense apparently without reading all the posts isn't a good way to conduct yourself.’’<br>
<br>
<br>
Look Dall, allow me to spell it out for you, I read ALL the posts and then I made mine, included in my posts were these little snippets of information your eyes obviously missed:<br>
<br>
<br>
‘’ Firstly what he did was harrassment/abuse call it what you will, and in the context he did it there is no doubt that it was wrong.’’<br>
<br>
‘’He messed up’’<br>
<br>
‘’And if he'd said it to me, I'd have told him to fvck off, but thats just me.’’<br>
<br>
<br>
If you could fvcking READ you would have noticed that I did not defend his actions, in fact I condemmed them, openly and quite clearly, it was the continuation of the verbal bashing I spoke up on.  You might want to try some reasonable ‘conduct’ yourself and stop making @#%$ up.<br>
<br>
<br>
‘’Personally, I think you made that post just to stir up more angst here’’<br>
<br>
Oh go fvck yourself you pompous little @#%$, I gave a serious response to a serious topic and if you read something else into my initial post (which noone else did btw) then maybe you can go read it again…and again….untiul it sinks in.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
‘’Your post was so obviously out of whack with the reality of the situation that you were asked to just go back to AB’’<br>
<br>
<br>
Are you smoking the pipe as you write this??  Which bit about my post was:<br>
<br>
‘obviously out of whack with the reality of the situation’  ?????<br>
<br>
The bit where I said he did wrong?  Get a clue ffs.<br>

/sigh<br>
Yet another serious thread hijacked.  Those protesting the hijack merely perpetuate it.  I will try to bring us back on track, despite this thread being pretty much over.<br>
<br>
I personally like seeing the name of a repeat sexual harasser near the top of the forum so more people can find out and add Yumtum to their ignore list.  But let's try to keep the virulence to a minimum.  The last few responses have become increasingly vicious.<br>
<br>
If you said &quot;Now go fvck yourself (again) you clueless little @#%$.&quot; in /say in a public area, you'd be just as liable to a warning for vulgar behavior as what Yumtum said, although the cases are definitely apples and oranges.  That said, let's get back to the topic at hand for a bit.<br>
<br>
I let my seven year old (and 4 year old daughter) son watch my spouse and I play.  They really enjoy it.  (Especially dragon kills! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> )  My son's reading skills are getting better and better every day.  I get a big kick out of him reading &quot;You have enetered North Freeport&quot; out loud.  (OT:  The LOADING, PLEASE WAIT &lt;post death&gt; announcements aren't always as well received, lol) <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I most definitely do NOT want my children reading that kind of language (Yumtum's or Mitch's), or the violent sexual overtones they contain when they are watching me play.  I have language filters ON, yet a V and U (see above foul language in quotes) are similar enough that my child will see through it even if the langauge filter will not.<br>
<br>
I'm still not sensing any contrition on Yumtum's part. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
I don't think he'll ever see the light.  Maybe with time he'll change, but sexual harassers in my experience typically don't.<br>
<br>
Mitch, as an aside, I'm not bashing you for your language in this thread (though I personally find it distasteful), but merely pointing out that language would be grounds for reporting if used in game.  This forum and in game are lightyears apart with regards to acceptable language, I think we'd both agree.<br>

Someone said that because Smilin' wasn't posting this herself that it probably meant that it didn't bother her all that much.<br>
<br>
Au contraire. Just a fact you should be aware of, many people, men and women, when subjected to abuse/harassment feel embarassed and ashamed, and you'd be surprised how often it DOESN'T get reported for this very reason.<br>
<br>
Even in the case of actual physical rape, people do not report it, but attempt to deal with it internally, which is the wrong way to go about it, but you don't always make the right decisions when you're put in a situation that embarrasses you and makes you uncomfortable.<br>
<br>
So just because the person harassed didn't post doesn't mean it didn't bother her. <br>
<br>
Speculating something like that almost makes it seem like you condone it. Oh, well she didn't complain, so it must be okay. Frankly, had someoen spoken up earlier about his alleged prior incidents, we might not be lookin' at this thread.<br>
<br>
Kudos to Smilin' and her bf for havin the guts to at least bring it out in the open.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
I believe you are referring to me and I think you are taking PART of what I said and presenting it out of context. I spent most of that thread making it darn clear I did NOT condone it. My point is that I believe that reporting such behavior is the right thing to do. Reporting such behavior does the whole community a service by giving Verant the chance to remove this pox from our &quot;land&quot;. While posting about it here makes us all aware, I think filing a report should be done first. My opinions goes specifically to this quote from you:<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;Frankly, had someoen spoken up earlier about his alleged prior incidents, we might not be lookin' at this thread.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
the NEXT time it happens, will you agree with me that if enough of the victims of his prior offenses had reported his action through the proper channels, we might not be looking at the NEXT thread.<br>
This is not an indictment of either poo or Smilin, just stating my opinion. <br>
If you read my whole post, and not just the parts you refer to and you honestly think I was condoning this child's behavior, let me know and I will be sure to clarify just how much I DONT condone it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ubirren.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Birren</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 329<br> <font color=#E9D756>(6/23/02 9:40:02 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3421.topic&index=110>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: taking small offense</span><hr size=1> cant hear anything from him if you have him on ignore <p><a href='http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=248327'>Birren Anklebiter</a><BR>

<br>
<br>
1.  Scroll back, using one of 3 methods, to the offending text so it is visible in your chat window aka text box.<br>
-Method 1 is using the little slider bar on your GUI (graphical user interface)<br>
-Method 2 is using your keyboard which can help scroll the text back fast.  Hold SHIFT down then tap on PAGEUP or PAGEDOWN and it makes the text scroll by 10 lines at a time.<br>
-Method 3 is using your mouse wheel if you have one.  Very useful for fine tuned control.<br>
<br>
<br>
2.  Once you see the offensive text in the chat window, type /report &lt;playername&gt;.  In this instance it would be:<br>
<br>
/report yumten<br>
<br>
<br>
What this does is send a snapshot of the 10 lines visible, counting from the bottom of the chat window, to a VERANT report check database.<br>
<br>
<br>
------------------------------------<br>
<br>
&quot;OK, I did that Warren, what now?&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
Now that you've done that, use the /petition command by simply typing /petition &lt;your complaint here&gt;.  Again, using this thread as an example:<br>
<br>
/petition Yumten used some very offensive and harrassing language.  I've submitted a /report check for your review.  Thank you.<br>
<br>
<br>
Assuming your server is staffed, a guide will get back to you.  If not, keep trying.  Persistence is key.  When a guide does get back to you, explain when this occurred.  Be calm and courteous.<br>
<br>
<br>
What happens next is not usually known and lends many people to believe that nothing is being done.  I assure you that its not the case but I can only give you assurances, not proof.  <br>
<br>
A Verant GM is called in to look at the report database at the time index given to see if anything viable is there.  If the offending language is seen, the GM or the guide will contact the offender if online and issue a warning.   <br>
<br>
Later on, the warning database is consulted, if the Offender has accumulated 3 or more warnings, the player account is then reviewed for further action.   Suspension (usually for a week) or Banishment (permanent, account cancelled).<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Q &amp; A<br>
<br>
<br>
Question:  What do you mean exactly about chat windows?<br>
<br>
Answer:  A normal chat window is 10 physical lines in height (Top to Bottom) as opposed to complete sentence lines if you follow my meaning.  10 lines refer to actual height on your monitor.   What I do not know is what exactly happens if you maximize and change your chat box in Transparent User Windows Mode. <br>
<br>
<br>
Question:  Why are you mentioning this, Warren?<br>
<br>
Answer:  To make people aware of in-game alternatives to real life frustration and anxiety.  <br>
<br>
<br>
Question:  I messed up the report check and now it won't let me do another one.  <br>
<br>
Answer:  The simple thing to do is zone.  Every time you zone, you are allowed to make another /report check.  Under no circumstances should you camp though.  Camping will allow you to make another report check but will also clear out your chat window which defeats the purpose.  <br>
TIP:  To reduce the potential loss of important chat, zone to a low population area to reduce the likelihood of 'spam', also, turn chat filters off to prevent the text from scrolling off into oblivion.<br>
<br>
<br>
Question:  But Warren, can't I just send in my /logs or screenshots?<br>
<br>
Answer:  Common misconception and the answer is always NO.  Sometimes a GM may ask for a log or screenshot to verify something ELSE but it can NEVER be used as actionable evidence against an Abusive player.<br>
<br>
<br>
Question:  Why not my logs or SS's?<br>
<br>
Answer:  They can be edited easily.  /report checks cannot.<br>
<br>
<br>
Question:  Warren, are you a Guide?<br>
<br>
Answer:  No comment.<br>
<br>
<br>
Question:  Warren, are you a lawyer?<br>
<br>
Answer:  No comment.<br>
<br>
<br>
Question:  Warren.  Does &quot;no comment&quot; mean &quot;Yes, I am but I'm saying no comment anyway?&quot;<br>
<br>
Answer:  No..... and no further comment.<br>
<br>
<br>
Questoin:  Will a guide contact me if they give the player a warning?<br>
<br>
Answer:  Sometimes.  There is a small window of time when a petitioner is kept in the loop on the progress of a report like this.  Most of the time you will get, &quot;we'll take care of it as soon as possible&quot;  But too much time after the fact, while the Offender is warned (providing the report check yielded something), the petitioner is not retroactively informed of the warning.<br>
<br>
<br>
Question:  Alright, I just got someone threatening he knows me in RL and is going to do real physical injury to me.  <br>
<br>
Answer:  Make sure you do all what I stated in this post.  GM's can and do have the ability to call local authorities if there are real life concerns involved.  Major harrassment issues, stalking, threats, even if someone tells you they are going to commit suicide.  While Verant will not give you the identity of a player they do have their personal information and can turn that over to the authorities.   Issuing real world threats even in a game is actionable in the eyes of the Law.  <br>
<br>
<br>
Question:  Well I didn't get a threat but this harrassment was bad, and I mean really bad.<br>
<br>
Answer:  Again, do what I've said, if the harrassment was in fact really really bad, a player can get suspended or banned immediately regardless that he/she had no prior warnings.<br>
<br>
<br>
Question:  This is a load of BS.  /reports and /petitions do nothing.<br>
<br>
Answer:  It is your prerogative to believe so.  My opinion of the matter is, don't complain about something if you are not at least willing to try to do something about it.  Otherwise you are just whining.   I cannot give you proof that this works, that GM's and guides 'can't do @#%$' about this type of event.  I can only assure you they can do what I've said and have you take my words on faith.  Do as you will.<br>
<br>
<br>
Question:  Thanks Warren, this really helps.<br>
<br>
Answer:  My pleasure &lt;smiles&gt;.  If you have any further questions, find me in game or post in general forums to get my attention.  I have a personal policy never to reply to any rant/flame directed at me which I may decide at a later time to break.  But I've never had a reason to before.<br>

<br>
The more and more i read this thread, the more i see "poor" Smilin,  and "poor" pookii, the more i want to wretch.<br>
<br>
The kind of sexual-control you're asking for doesnt exist.  You've taken this way out of proportion.  And for everyone who has judged Yumten,  "judge not, lest thee be judged thyself".   The truth is,  life doesnt work the way you're asking.   You go on the net and you can be innocently browsing,  and you'll find something way worse than what Yumten said.  Go look up the movie "Lolita",   or try and find an article on Gay Rights.   You wont find the movie before you find porn, and you wont find an article on Gay Rights before you find more porn.  <br>
<br>
The same exists off the computer too.  Go to the bar, and im sure before the night is through you'll hear more than one lewd remark, swear word, and you might even get hit on.   You dont even have to go to a bar.  Go to a school,  hell, go to Yumten's schools.  Im sure this kind of harrassment DOES happen at his school,  in a *joking* manner.  How do i know?  Cause ive only been out of school for 5 years,  it happened back then, and our contries are in the middle of a sexual revelution, im sure if anything its worse.<br>
<br>
So go ahead and flame Yumten.  KX has gotten an assload of of negative publicity that we're not proud of.  Let me make it clear (as i did in my last post) that KX doesnt condone this kind of behavior.   But you know what?   You're just two whining snivelling attention seekers,  and i cant stand people like you.   You're the fat kids that sat in the front of the room at school so the teacher could see you so you wouldnt get picked on.  You're the kids that went to the councillor and told her how 'traumatized' you were cause Joe Smack said a swear word and looked at you funny in gym class.   You led an isolated life if you think this is any differant from the real world,  and I for one arent on the Pity Bus with half of the people in this thread.   <br>

<br>
Smilin wasn't looking up gay rights, Lolita, or at a singles bar. She was playing a game, where there are rules against this type of behavior. She had no reason to expect to run into this kind of treatment, nor should she have to put up with it.<br>
<br>
Pookii didn't come here to outcry a horrible oppressive world, he came to warn others to watch out for someone who harasses people. It sounds like you are more concerned that your guild was pressured to take action than you were to be associating with someone who makes uninvited sexual remarks to strangers online.<br>
<br>
The part where you denigrated them and lambased outcast high schoolers was completely out of left field, and classless.<br>

<br>
This thread isn't about pity; it isn't even about the victim.  And you are correct, it's not different from the real world.  In the real world, if a man went up to a female co-worker and said what Yumten admitted saying to Smilin he'd be fired so fast his head would spin.  No employer will risk that kind of liability.  Here in this not-real world, there is no &quot;employer,&quot; so alternative ways are found to place responsibility on the individual.  Publicizing his behavior, and allowing him to finish trashing his reputation by his defensive justifications and self-pitying &quot;apologies,&quot; served that purpose.<br>
<br>
It has more real world application than you might think, if the perpetrator learned what should have been obvious to him (even at the &quot;young&quot; age of 16) -- you don't go around talking to people like that, and if you do, actions have consequences.<br>
<br>
On another note, why you thought blasting the people who reported this conduct would somehow take the heat off Yumten or your guild is a puzzlement.  All you've done is make the situation worse, not better.<br>
