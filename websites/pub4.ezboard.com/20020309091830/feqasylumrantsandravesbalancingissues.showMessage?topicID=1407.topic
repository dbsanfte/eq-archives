At first it seemed like an ok idea, get off work, go get on the bus down the street, ride for 20-22 hours, napping most of the way, spend time with my family, and then ride the 20-22 hours back to head into work. A bit of a hectic schedule over all for a holiday season, but seeing my mom ultimately seemed like it was worth it.<br><br>      It started innocently enough, with the first bus out of San Antonio being 45 min late to board and over an hour and a half late for departure time. Your staff was all seemingly friendly and apologetic that stuff was running behind with the holiday travel, but that the time would be made up as the driver was skipping stations after calling them to verify no one was waiting to get on there.<br><br>      We got to Dallas with 15 min before the transfer I needed to make. So I get into my appropriate line at gate 6, stand there, they load the bus, and at 10 or so people before me....announced the bus was full. No problem, I had expected that...after all, on the phone you had informed me that you often book more than one bus load and get extra buses to handle extra traffic. The agent shouted over the speaker that another bus was on the way.<br><br>      2 1/2 hours later, that other bus arrived. Silly me, I would have thought that having been the company that SOLD the 600 tickets, and knowing that a bus only seats 80 or so, that you were going to need quite a few more buses. But as the 2 1/2 hours went by, and then the mad rush of the original group I was with fighting with the NEW group of people legitametely booked for THAT scheduled bus for a space on it, I began to realize what the nightmare was I had signed on for. I managed to get on that bus, in fact, crammed in like sardines, but ultimately it didn't matter. The driver didn't know where half the stations were, driving in circles to find them, and got us to Oklahoma City 3 hours and 45 minutes late.<br><br>      Needless to say, my connection bus had left 3 hours earlier. My option? Sit in Okalahoma City for 5 hours for the next bus. Fun! My holiday joy was reaching insurmountable levels at this point where I promptly pulled a taxi aside and instructed him &quot;Take me to a gay bar.&quot; where I then sat drinking a beer and watching WHO WANTS TO BE A MILLIONAIRE and WILL AND GRACE and trying to call my mother to let her know that my arrival time of 7am friday morning was looking to be more like 6pm friday night.<br><br>      Finally I get back to the station, once AGAIN, have to fight between the two crowds of &quot;made to miss our bus&quot; and &quot;scheduled to go on this one&quot; for a seat, which I again managed to do.<br><br>      I arrived in Iowa, finally, after what seemed an eternity of journey....34 hours later. Once there, it became readily apparent that no one at greyhound had any idea where ANYONE'S baggage was. &quot;Oh, you didn't move it from bus to bus?&quot; &quot;No, greyhound staff specifically told us at EVERY stop *not* to, that the staff would transfer it.&quot; &quot;Oh, well your luggage is probably at your destination.&quot; That phrase at every stop quickly came to mean &quot;I don't have any idea but don't want to listen to you bitch, so I'm just going to tell you it's there safe&quot;, when in fact, as people one by one reached their end destination, the baggage was no where to be found. THEN suddenly it was &quot;Oh, it *must* be on the bus behind you.&quot; Of course.<br><br>      And you stay in business this way?<br><br>      I then had the return trip. Given my experience on the way out, and the fact that I needed to be at work Sunday late, I decided to leave a bit earlier than I had originally intended....you know. Just in case.<br><br>      So at 12:05am on Saturday night, I went out to the greyhound station in my mom's hometown. It was, of course, closed, and there was no outside enclosure of any sort. Just a sign on the side of the building. The bus was an hour late, and by the time it pulled up, the wind chill and snow had pretty much made me thankful for whatever hell awaited me.....or so I thought.<br><br>      Your driver got off the bus and informed me &quot;There are no seats left and no room for baggage under the bus. You can wait 14 hours for the next bus, or you can stand in the aisle for the next 2 hours until we get where we drop some people off.&quot;<br><br>      Hmmm. Not really much of a choice since I had to be to work, huh?<br>      So I stood in your even more crowded than I thought possible, bus. People sitting on each other's laps for christ sake. We reached Kansas City, where there was MASS confusion and going on. Those of us on the bus were asked to get off, but leave our items, they would do a reboard call before a boarding call. So we did. An hour and a half later, a boarding call was announced, and they boarded new passengers, most of whom in that dog eat dog mentality your business promotes in us travelers, dumped our shit into the aisle and took up residence in our already secured seating.<br><br>      Then there was the driver. Where the fuck did you get HER? Retired High School Bus drivers Association? If even the slightest MURMUR of talking was heard, she YELLED at us across the intercom &quot;NO TALKING&quot;. No talking, no asking to turn the heater on because our hands and feet were turning blue, no pretty much anything from this fucking 90 year old bitch with a broom firmly shoved up her cunt as she drove around cackling &quot;I'll get you my pretty, and your little dog Greyhound as well!&quot;<br><br>      So finally, Tulsa. Oh, look. 4,000 people all standing around waiting for buses. Let me guess. You booked too many people and now have 2 to 3 different sets of legit travelers all fighting over who can push who out of the way first to get a seat. Yep! God this is fun! So two or three buses pass through....I finally get on one, to get to Dallas.<br><br>      Ah, Dallas. I'm almost done! The horror is coming to an end. Except Dallas has 9,000 people all crammed into a 10 foot by 10 foot space. In order to get to my connection bus, I am instructed that rather than walking directly TO my bus, less than 4 feet away, I must go into the terminal, fight through the crowd, and then back out to the bus.<br><br>      Wearily, I begin my journey. I am lodged in the very entrance. No one is waiting on my bus (leaving in 5 minutes mind you), they are all there for buses anywhere from an hour later to 4 hours later. I push, I shove, but even at my size it just doesn't matter because they are all crammed in here so tight. The bus is leaving, I turn around and go back to the entrance to walk to the bus which I SHOULD have done originally.<br><br>      And that's when I got to meet your idea of Security. This needle dicked pasty faced wonderboy of all of 19 starts waving his insecurity around in my face and trying to pass it off as authority. I simply ignore him and continue on, at this point aware that the bus has LEFT and am now going to have to fight for the NEXT one, so am just going outside to smoke.<br><br>      Your child in his &quot;I wish I were cool enough to have a REAL uniform&quot; outfit then begins shouting at me that if I don't get back into that crowd he's going to keep me there all goddamn night because HE CAN DO THAT. And then he grabbed me.<br><br>      I had had it at that point. I stalked steadily forward, backing him into the side of your Memphis bus (DEAPARTING IN 5 MINUTES! PLEASE CLUB THE NEAREST GRANDMOTHER NEAR YOU AND GET A SEAT NOW! MERRY CHRISTMAS!) and informed this child who was so desperate for my attention how very much he really needed to be elsewhere rather than trying to manhandle me when I am very politely minding my own business since GREYHOUND WON'T FUCKING MIND IT FOR ME.<br><br>      He appeared to agree with me as he found someplace else to be very quickly.<br><br>      Ultimately I got home, as this letter would suggest. And sat right down to type this up. I'd demand a refund, but I know, 9th circle of hell that you guys are and irony being what it is... what you'd give me is a travel voucher, and I can assure you that I will never ever, in any way shape or form, be setting foot in one of your buses or terminals again.<br><br>      So, in the spirit of the holiday season, I just wish to offer a final holiday thought to your company, after my extended time with them over the last few days.<br><br>Fuck You.<br><br><br><br><br>ps to the lanys community: I blame tarot. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><center><table><tr><td><center><font>come get some</font><p>Rugen Payne<br>55 Templar<br><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=16667">Armour Profile</a> <big>-</big> <a href="http://www.darke.net/">Homepage</a></td><Td><a href="http://www.darke.net/journalpix/swallowsoul.wav"><img border="0" src="http://www.darke.net/journalpix/rugencrouch.gif" width="120"></a></td></tr></table></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/utarotoflanys.showPublicProfile?language=EN>TarotofLanys</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.srforum.f2s.com/phpBB/images/smiles/icon_pirate.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle><FONT COLOR=AA0000><B>Moderator Pirate</B></FONT></span><br> <font color=#000033>(12/24/01 1:27:22 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumrantsandravesbalancingissues.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1407.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: To whom it may concern: (GREYHOUND)</span><hr size=1> Awww you didn't post my bus suggestions. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br> <p><a href="http://www.anarchyboard.com" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.conquest-guild.com/tarot/Tarotsign.jpg" border="0"></a> <br><FONT COLOR=000000 SIZE=1>Realm </FONT><FONT COLOR=FF0000 SIZE=1>RETIRED</FONT><BR><FONT COLOR=000000 SIZE=1>Everquest: Fennin Ro, Karana, Ero Marr & Lanys T'Vyl </FONT><FONT COLOR=FF0000 SIZE=1>RETIRED</FONT><BR><FONT COLOR=000000 SIZE=1>Ultima Online: Catskills </FONT><FONT COLOR=FF0000 SIZE=1>INACTIVE</FONT><BR><FONT COLOR=000000 SIZE=1>Anarchy Online: Beta Tester, Rubi-Ka 1 </FONT><FONT COLOR=FF0000 SIZE=1>RETIRED</FONT><BR><FONT COLOR=000000 SIZE=1>Dark Age of Camelot: Beta Tester;Merlin Midgard</FONT><FONT COLOR=008000 SIZE=1> CURRENT</FONT></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ugolliwog.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Golliwog</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_greenspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I live here.... get out.</span><br> <font color=#000033>(12/24/01 1:46:58 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumrantsandravesbalancingissues.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1407.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: To whom it may concern: (GREYHOUND)</span><hr size=1> Hope you sent that to them <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><a href="mailto:golliwog@ns.sympatico.ca"><b>Golliwog Greensbane</a></b><BR>60 Warlord - Lanys - <a href="http://pub37.ezboard.com/brevivedguildmessageboards"  target="_blank">Revived</a><BR>16 Warden - Morgan Le Fay - <a href="http://pub10.ezboard.com/bthechosenboards82554" target="_blank">Chosen Clan</a><BR><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=37645" target="_blank">"Only those who risk going too far can possibly know how far they can really go." - T.S.

Arrive at destination. looks like a school bus stop. I get out, driver looks for my luggage, oops. must have got put on the other bus. You'll have to contact corporate to track your luggage. sorry this is friday and noone will be in til monday.<br><br>Monday, sorry sir, we'll put an immediate track on your bags.<br><br>Tuesday, sorry sir, your luggage ended up in IOWA. its on its way back to you.<br><br>Wednesday, sorry sir, they forgot to take your bags off at your locale and they ended up in indianapolis. they should be their tomorrow nite.<br><br>Thursday, sorry sir, there was noone their at that time of nite to accept your baggage and unless you wanted it sitting on the street the driver decided for security reasons to keep it on the bus.<br><br>Friday, sorry sir, we've been unable to ensure your luggage arrives with someone to accept it. You will have to come to the chicago station to pick it up. (chicago is 2 hours away) NO, FUCK NO. deliver my bags to my town tomorrow.<br><br>Saturday, sorry sir, they are still being tracked through St Louis<br><br>Monday again, I've gone a week wearing the same damn clothes. kinda nice sitting naked in your grandmothers house doing the same clothes every day. makes you feel like the baby all over again.<br><br>Tuesday, my luggage is at the ticket office woohoo.<br><br>Wednesday, time to go back to dallas now. my vacation is over. the first half of trip to memphis goes flawlessly, im in shock. the second half however, completely different story.<br>Halfway to amarillo the air conditioner for the bus goes out. starting to get warm in their with the hot june sun shining through the windows. windows only crack open a bit so very little air moving through. the poor little 3 year old sitting next to me looks like shes gonna sweat herself to death. In Texarkana there arent any extra buses to transfer on so we have to stay in the very warm and starting to smell because of the bathroom at the back of the bus and enjoy what remains of our trip to dallas.<br><br>At the end of this, I got a travel voucher.
