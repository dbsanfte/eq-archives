 <br>
I don't recall much of my infancy. I do recall those times being rather dark and confusing. I vaguely remember fighting and people screaming. <br>
<br>
As a youth I recall spending my days among Humans in Freeport. I was always aware that I looked different and more often than not people treated me like a freak. I became self-conscious and as a result I built a wall around myself. <br>
<br>
I let very few people inside of my circle. Those who mocked me or made fun were dealt with physically. I spent a lot of time behind bars as a youth, which only made me stronger. I took crap for nobody and I paid the price for my victories every time. <br>
<br>
I still maintained a kind nature towards those who were nice to me. I learned the Human language and excelled in the arts of sword and club fighting in the local Warriors guild. Amazed by my incredible strength and speed, the Guild Leader made me an honorary member to their bloodthirsty arena. There, I honed my skills and became a ferocious Warrior. No Human nor beast was my equal in combat. <br>
<br>
I soon began to long for the truth of my identity. I had matured and began to ask why I was different than the people around me. For some reason the secret was well guarded. My Guild Leader eventually told me that I was a prisoner of war when the Humans laid seige to the Ogre village that lies south of Freeport. My mother and father were killed during the seige and the humans took pity on me as a newborn. I was brought to Freeport and raised as a Human, but with a suspicious eye. Now I knew where I came from and thus began my desire to go back to my rightful home. <br>
<br>
I decided to go back to my homeland and seek out any relatives I could find. Upon arriving I approached an Ogre guard to ask directions. Weapons drawn, they asked me why I spoke the language of their sworn enemies. I shut my mouth, shrugged and walked slowly away from them. They pursued me and I ran for my life. After being trained many years in the Warrior guild I had exceptional stamina which helped me to outrun them. <br>
<br>
I left the Ogre village area, sad that I was labelled as an outcast before I had the chance to explain my past. Homeless, I decided to walk the lands of Norrath and see what was out there. I discovered many new cities, none of which were very acceptant of me. Most of the people I met were very suspicious of me though I did them no harm. <br>
<br>
And here I am, a full grown Ogre, with a thirst for adventure and a blade made for killing. I have no home and I have no family. I walk alone, seeking whatever there is to find. <br>
 <br>
New Friends - Smashin Thanatos <br>
 <br>
I met a group of people in Highpass Hold. A group of outcasts themselves, they took me in as one of their own. They introduced me to their clan - Dark Reign. A sinister name for such a loving family...rather an oxymoron as they were the brightest and most caring people I had ever met. <br>
<br>
They showed me new places to hunt. Together, we killed many Orcs and Gnolls. For some reason the people in Norrath began to like me more. Apparently these foul beasts were a terror throughout the lands. My glorious deeds in battle earned me new honors and legend. My name became that of lore. <br>
<br>
Some time later, we ventured to a newly discovered country - Kunark. We travelled far and wide in search of new treasure and adventure. We came to a lake call Lake of Ill Omen. There, I honed my skills with my axe and my staff. I gained more insight and knowledge in the arts for combat. In a short time, I became known as Smashin Thanatos - Thanatos means the Principle of Death. I caused death, often, and those around me saw me relish in my innate ability to extinguish life rather effortlessly and with great expertise. <br>
<br>
The undead in the lake area refused to give chase after a short spell. My name had spread to the legions of undead. They made every effort to steer clear of me and hunting became a bore in that area. So, we packed up and moved on. <br>
<br>
We travelled through the mountains and came across a new area called the Frontier Mountains. Shortly thereafter, we stumbled across a giant fortress. Inside the fortress were numerous giants - rather dumb and clumsy creatures. Without provocation, they attacked us. With a smile on my face and fury in my veins, we quickly dispatched the group of them and set up camp. This was to be our new home. <br>
<br>
Somewhere along the way, our family decided to grow. Though we had a powerful clan, the desire to kill powerful creatures was nowhere in our reach. Our Dark Reign family had been friends with the clan Seven Dreams for many years. We thought it was only a natural progression to join our forces and fight the evils of Norrath as one. And so, with our combined families, we became a part of the Dream. <br>
 <br>
The Journey Back Home - Smashin Thanatos <br>
 <br>
Our brief stay among our Seven Dreams friends was fast paced and exciting. Among the 120+ clan members some of us felt lost in the crowd. I came to realize that I, and a few others, longed for the slower paced family environment of the old Dark Reign. Together, half of our original clan left our friends in Seven Dreams and came back to rebuilt our clan. It was hard to leave behind half of our original Dark Reign members in a their new guild, But knowing how way leads to way, we knew they would never be too far away to share a conversation with. And so a new dawn begins once again for Dark Reign. <br>
<br>
The Rebuilding Begins - Smashin Thanatos <br>
 <br>
Our tribal leader, Bello, stirred around the small guild hall looking up briefly once reaching the other side. He sighed and said, &quot;The problem with this room is that it is too small. These walls need to be made longer and wider.&quot; The other members whispered among themselves with a hint of sarcasm and disbelief. <br>
<br>
Bello quickly turned around and glared across the hall. A hush fell over the hall. &quot;We have always been a family...a good family...an honorable family. Like any family, we grow, or we die out,&quot; Bello said. The members vaguely nodded their heads but some were hesistant to want to make the family larger. Their sense of small community is what keeps them with us. &quot;We will never be a large family because the weak are weeded out and our desire to know each brother and sister is essential to ensure nobody feels left out. Our family will maintain our quality and our...but we will expand this hall to make room for our new generations to come.&quot; The members nodded with some approval. <br>
<br>
Bello turned toward around and with a simple hand gesture, the new family members Nomaru, Sernest, Whitchy, Bladecurser, Lathorn and Nollo walked in through the guild hall door. &quot;I'd like you to meet your new family,&quot; Bello said as he held out his hand in the direction of the elder guild members. The new members looked nervous and felt unsure of their decision to join us. In a split second, everyone quickly jumped to their feet and rushed to greet the new members with open arms. I personally think Bello has some kind of psychic influence on their behavior. <br>
<br>
Bello looked please as he watched from across the hall while the new members interacted and spoke with tribal elders. He knew the days of being a small family would eventually have to turn into days of being a medium sized family. With the competition of other clans growing larger by the day he knew we had to make our tribe larger to ensure our survival. That stately hobbit has but one goal and that is to ensure everyone is happy. I think he is realizing his goal with Ogre-sized strides on a daily basis.  <br>
<br>
A Campfire Story as Told by Bello - Smashin Thanatos <br>
 <br>
We gathered around the large fire pit in the guildhall. Periodically, our clan leader tells stories of fame, fable and fortune. Here is the story he recently told us about a brief trip to Steamfont Mountains. He had gated himself into the area when a young Gnome named Nikilette approached him...<br>
Nikilette walked up to Bello and asked, “Are you nice?” Bello responded, “I am nice! I am very nice! What can I do for you?” Nikilette responded, “Well, I need some money.” Bello, being a very caring and giving person, decided to not only help the young Necromancer out, but also tell her a story. First, he handed her about 28 plat in change. Nikilette thanked Bello and said, “OH MY!! Thank you so much! I didn't mean so much, only 2 or 3 plat.” Bello smiled and was about to sit her down for a story when along came a mighty sword-wielder by the name of Trakaar.<br>
<br>
Bello said, “Hey Trakaar!” and Trakaar shot back, “Hey Bello! What ya up to?” Bello explained, “I am gonna tell Nikilette a story.” Trakaar asked Bello if he could listen and Bello nodded. Bello instructed the two to sit and enjoy the story. Bello began…<br>
<br>
“This is a story about Jinjin. Jinjin lived in a city many lands away from here. He was a little Halfling Thief who made his living by taking things from others. Jinjin did not like being called a Thief, he preferred the term - Opportunist. Jinjin liked to hang around the center of town. He would watch as people came and went, picking his victims as he saw fit. One day, Jinjin followed an older man into the bank. The man looked like a worn out wizard. He carried a large staff with him and had a very discolored robe. Jinjin approached the man and said, “I have never seen you in these parts. Are you new to the area?” The man answered, “No, I have been here many times. I just needed to get some money for a drink.” Jinjin nodded and said, “I can show you where the bar is if you like.” The man glared at Jinjin. “I know where the bar is, now off with you!'” the man scoffed at Jinjin. Jinjin scampered off and waited around the corner of the bar. He waited for the man to go in the bar and then snuck inside. The man had leaned his large staff against a wall and unattended as he bellied up to the bar. Jinjin saw an opportunity to take the staff, so he did....”<br>
<br>
Bello then handed Nikilette a Runed Totem Staff. Nikilette was very excited about this and screamed, “Ohhh!!! THANK YOU!” Bello smiled and continued his story…<br>
<br>
“Jinjin grabbed the staff an sprinted back to his little hut. He placed the staff among the other things he has stolen and went about his day. A few hours later, Jinjin noticed a man with a skull in his hand. Jinjin was both scared and curious about the skull. Jinjin went up to the man and asked, “Is that a real person's skull?” The man answered, “YES! it is the skull of a terrible foe who I laid to rest!” Jinjin asked the man, “Why did you kill him?” The man replied, “Because he asked to many questions!” Jinjin saw the anger in the man's eye and quickly left. Jinjin watched the man walk into a small store. There were many people in the store and Jinjin knew he would be able to get that skull with ease. So Jinjin walked into the store and pushed someone into the man. In the confusion, Jinjin swiped the skull...”<br>
<br>
Bello then handed her a Skull of Jhen'Tra. Nikilette screamed, “OHHHH!!!!! THANK YOU!” Bello smiled and continued the story…<br>
<br>
“...and sprinted back to his hut to put away the skull with the rest of his stolen items. The next day, a powerful looking Magician came to town. He held in his hand a staff with a beautiful blue jewel that sat at the top of it. Jinjin ran up to the Mage and said, “That staff is really neat! Does it do magic?” The Mage looked down at Jinjin and asked, “Do you practice the arts, young Halfling?” Jinjin rebutted, “Of course! I am practicing to be a powerful Magician, just like you when I get bigger!” The Mage laughed at Jinjin. He felt proud and hopeful that others wanted to carry on his mystical arts. The Mage kneeled down and said, “I just use this as a walking stick. My battle staff is stowed away in my home. Here take this staff.” The Mage handed Jinjin the staff...”<br>
<br>
Bello handed her a Water Crystal Staff. Nikilette screamed, 'OHHH!!! THANK YOU SO MUCH!' Bello smiled and continued his story…’<br>
<br>
The Mage looked down at Jinjin and said, “Take the staff and continue our dieing arts. Without the new blood, the old blood dies in vain.” Jinjin nodded, took the staff and ran to his hut and placed it among his other items in his horde. A short time later, a group of powerful adventures came into town. They looked beat down and tired. Jinjin ran over to a mighty Warrior. He said, “What happened to you guys?” The Warrior looked down at Jinjin and said, “We came from the Dreadlands...” The Warrior caught his breath and continued, “...we encountered this half-spider half-man beast. He cast powerful magic and hit with the force of a hill giant!” Jinjin looked the Warrior over and saw something sticking out of his leg armor. Jinjin said, “There is something stuck in your armor. Want me to remove it?” The Warrior said, “Please do.” Jinjin pulled on the object...<br>
<br>
Bello gave her a Drachnid Leg Tip. Nikilette screamed, “OH!!! Thank you! What is it?” bello smiled and said, it is a piercing weapon. Nikilette grinned evilly and Bello continued his story…<br>
<br>
“...and held it aloft. The Warrior said, “Bloody thing nearly killed my group!” Jinjin helped the Warrior get cleaned up and bandaged. After he helped the Warrior, Jinjin ran to his hut and placed the weapon among his stash of stolen goods. The next day, Jinjin spotted a wealthy looking man enter the bank. Jinjin followed him in there and began to beg the man, “Please sir, might I have a copper to help my ailing mother?” The man looked down at Jinjin and said, “You know what the problem is in the world today?” Jinjin looked confused and replied, “No, what is the problem with the world today?” The man kneeled down to Jinjin's eye level and said, “The problem is that YOU are in it! Now get out of here you little beggar!'” Taking out his little knife, Jinjin cut away a small money sack the man had on his belt without the man noticing...”<br>
<br>
Bello handed Nikilette another 100 platinum and Nikilette screamed, “OH NO! I can't take this!” Bello snapped at her, “SHUSH!!! I am telling a story!” Nikilette accepted the money and Bello continued…<br>
<br>
“...and ran back to his hut. He placed the money sack among the other things he had stolen. A few hours later, a man named Trakaar grabbed little Jinjin and said, “I have been watching you! You have a lot of loot, and now it belongs to me!” Trakaar held a knife to Jinjin's throat and made him show him the way to his hut. Trakaar threw Jinjin to the ground. Jinjin's head hit the hard floor and knocked him unconiscious. Jinjin awoke to an empty hut. All of his belongings were gone...all that work, all those items he had stolen were gone.”<br>
<br>
Bello then asked Nikilette, “Now, do you know what the morale of the story is?” Nikilette shyly responded, “Umm...to keep these items in a safe place until I get bigger?” Bello proudly said, “Exactly!! Now run your little feet as fast as they can carry you to the bank!” Nikilette asked, “OK, but what can I use now?” Bello snapped at her, “GO!!! BEFORE TRAKAAR TAKES YOUR ITEMS!” Little Nikilette scampered off to the bank, and was never heard from again.<br>
<br>
Bello is a very good storyteller. This story is one of my favorites because he was able to convey to a young adventurer that it is wise to keep items in a safe place until you are big enough to protect yourself. He was also able to get her started on a good foot with a few items she could soon use to grow in might and power. That Bello sure works in mysterious ways... <br>
 <br>
A New Alliance - Smashin Thanatos <br>
 <br>
Another clan from across the mountains made its way to our guild hall. They came bearing gifts and wearing smiles. We welcomed them into our hall and a discussion ensued between our clan leader and their clan leader. Term, the clan leader of The Royal Knights, asked our leader Bello if there was a chance for an alliance between our two guilds. Bello inquired as to what kind of clan they were and what they valued. Term told us that his clan was small and family oriented, much like our clan is. Bello agreed that both clans could benefit by such an alliance. And, so, from this day forth our clans keep in touch with one another in the event we need help or reinforcements. Hail Royal Knights and let us rejoice in our new alliance! <br>
<br>
The damned Ancient Cyclops - Smashin Thanatos <br>
 <br>
Having become a very capable Warrior, I set out to find the legendary Ancient Cyclops. Lore has it that this foul creature drops a magical ring, that, once given to a particular resident of the Rathe Mountains, renders you a pair of magical boots which increase your running speed to that of the speed of wolves. Having plodded slowly around the world with my large two feet on my Ogresque frame for many moons, I set out to find this cyclops and take that ring from him.<br>
My search for him began in the southern region of the desert known as Ro. For 70 hours I hunted for this beast. I turned over every rock, dug in the sand, asked the every local...nothing. In the seventh day I finally came across the monster. I charged at him as a viciously whirling blur of blades and fury. I handedly began to defeat the mighty cyclops...and just before he hit the ground I was recalled to the gods of never yore. I begged them to let me go back and collect my ring and yet they held me captive. After a minute of keeping me, they whispered, &quot;Your time will come, but not today.&quot; Hastily I found passage back to the scene of battle. The corpse of the cyclops was nowhere to be found...the ring was forever out of my grasp.<br>
<br>
I stumbled around the desert, lost... hopeless... desolate... surrendered... defeated... cast aside. The gods saw to it that I would not benefit from gaining the speed of wolves, for whatever their reasoning or logic was behind such a foul deed. I sat in that miserable desert for so many days... I used every ounce of blood and sweat to find that cyclops and once I came upon him it was taken from me, by the gods no less. I have become faithless! Damn the gods of never yore!<br>
<br>
I have since spent another 30 hours in the desert just as fruitless as I was when I started the search for the Ancient Cyclops. I search for the power to continue from within myself...never looking towards the sky for help or understanding. A worn Ogre bent on becoming as fast as the wolves... I shall find him... I shall conquer him... this is my destiny.<br>
 <br>
The Fall of the Dragon Nagafen - Smashin Thanatos <br>
 <br>
A call rung out through Norrath - &quot;Hear ye! Hear ye! All brave champions and wizards of Norrath are to assemble at the Druid ring in Lavastorm for a battle against the mighty dragon Nagafen!&quot; A call! A call to battle!<br>
I ran to the guild hall and gathered my magical equipment that granted me added protection from fire. The giant beast is capable of breathing a heave of fire upon his foes like a towering inferno that wholely swallows its prey. Having faced him before, I knew my only salvation came from being able to resist his mighty breath and fear-inducing dragon roar.<br>
<br>
Assembled at the circle, we made our groups; Seven groups in all. One by one we trodded down into the dragon's lair slaying all beasts and creatures in our path. The time came upon us...we gathered at the steps leading to his lair. I could hear his mighty grumble from beyond ourthe hall. A dragon with the gift of immortality, he recognized the sound of the battle hungry warriors and casters coming to lay claim of his treasure horde. He grew restless...as did we.<br>
<br>
The call was shout out, &quot;All warriors to battle!&quot; I led the band of capable warriors in the first wave of attack. Together we pummeled the dragon's scaley hide. He parried with numerous attacks that included his treacherous claws, his giant serpent like tail and his demonic breath and spells. He is a powerful foe and fights like a demon possessed. Still, we continued our flurry of melee and wore him down. In came the caster's pets to further our cause and soon thereafter the casters made contribution by casting powerful bolts of lightning and ice.<br>
<br>
The fight was almost won. The battle was ours...and for a brief instant, Nagafen looked at me with a desperate glare. Bowing his weakened neck, he peered into my eyes as I thrust my mighty Wurmslayer into his side. He roared out, &quot;Smashin! I shall soon die, but not before you!&quot; And with that, he clawed at my torso with every ounce of might he could muster in his defeated state. The blow ripped me wipe open and I felt my life force drain away.<br>
<br>
Darkness engulfed my battle worn consciousness while I my body sought refuge in perdition. I soon felt the presence of a healer. He said to me, &quot;Mighty Warrior, my entry into Elysium is blocked until I perform one final deed of goodness. You are a great warrior of legend and lore and I believe your death is untimely. So, I shall return you to your life and with that I shall pass to the heavens.&quot; Soon thereafter, I felt the amazing power and glory of his healing touch surge through my body.<br>
<br>
I opened my eyes to see my comrades cheering me to get up and see the slain dragon. I looked down at my chest where there had been two gaping mortal wounds and they had vanished. I strode over to the corpse of the slain beast and kneeled my head down to his bloodied ear. I whispered into his bloodied ear, &quot;I may have died before you, but my life has been replenished before yours. And though I am aware of your immortality and that you shall rise from your death, know that I will be there to face you once again to take your life to obtain the great treasures you hold within your lair.&quot;<br>
<br>
A grand party ensued. Cheering, laughter...even some joyous crying was overheard throughout the slain dragon's lair. Mortals had defeated the immortal, for today. Tomorrow is another day.<br>
 <br>
The Rise of a Warrior - Smashin Thanatos <br>
 <br>
So many people ask me how I became so powerful in such a short time. Well, I must admit, I owe it all to Bello. Once I was welcomed into the clan, he outfitted me for battle. Not with ordinary armor and weapons, but with gear of such magnitude that I was able to fight with the skill of many Warriors.<br>
Perhaps the most unique item Bello gave me was a tunic that rendered the ability to regenerate at super-human rates. I was able to take a slash in combat and watch it instantly heal before my eyes. I had a feeling of immortality and so I set out to gain the experience to grow into the gear I was given.<br>
<br>
I first cleared the lands of my native homeland. The lizards there have over-run the lands and were threatening to take over the entire area. Having dispatched them until they bore me no challenge, I ran to North Karana and defeated a clan of Bandits. The locals in the area thanked me for clearing the area of those pesky people and I soon moved on.<br>
<br>
I heard there were many evil beings in the Lake of Ill Omen. I set off to make things right in those lands and to clear the hills of evil. I felt my powers and abilities grow by leaps and bounds as I conquered everything in my path. Soon, the evils were thwarted and I relocated to an area known as the Frontier Mountains. A fortress located there contained a band of giants that were getting ready to take over the area with their might and strength. One by one I took them down and cleared the fortress.<br>
<br>
Having done my work there, I continued my adventures to the Overthere. Many beasts and Sarnak wandered the countryside. Fearing they would stop people from safe passage, I took it upon myself to make the lands more suitable for travel. After many days of combat, I cleared the entire countryside of beast and Sarnak.<br>
<br>
Having no further challenge in that continent, I set foot back to the lands from which I came. I had heard of a dungeon where a powerful dragon resided called Solusek's Eye. Knowing that dragons have vast hordes of treasure and loot, I went to seek my fortune. Within the cramped spaces of the dungeon, I fought Kobolds and their casting kin. After they became a mere annoyance, I killed the bats and beetles which still give me difficulty in slaying them if I am alone. Here is where I shall continue honing my abilities and skills until something else captures my interest.<br>
