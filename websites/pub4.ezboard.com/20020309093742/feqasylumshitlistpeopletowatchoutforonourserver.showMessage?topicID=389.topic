I left the post up for 5 days without Guild leadership response. I am omitting the guild name because this player does not accurately reflect that guilds vision.<br>____________________________________________________________<br>Hello, <br><br>Im calm, because quite frankly, I dont even know what I missed rolling on in Unrest tonight.<br><br>I was hanging in Unrest derailing trains and such. When Laaw invites me to a group camping the bar/tower. I replied no, mainly because I was doing other things to keep me busy and not able to devote my attention to the group.<br><br>Well, not very long after, the bar pops and he cant handle his pull I guess because there is a /shout HELP from Laaw.<br><br>So I go from the zone up to him where a warrior is already helping him and toss him a SH. NP, /wave .. bye. Again we cross paths as im checking out my new DD undead spell. He invites me , and i reluctantly accept.<br><br>Off he goes to spawn the Abomination, without even telling us wtf hes doing. Part of the group gets attacked by a WB and we start choppin away. Someone found the abomination and he goes out to engage it. Then he starts screaming in /group HEAL HEAL...I told him no- the WB first [he could have FD if he got into trouble so hes essentially safe if he isnt stupid]. So we take care of the WB in the house, and go out to find him about dead and hte abomination at just above half health. I toss him a SH, DD the thing a couple times and another heal. Its dead. <br><br>Loot..<br><br>He holds the loot quite a while. I figure hes gonna ninja at this point cause no one drops in loot mode for very long unless its no drop. He loots a FS staff and a Dust of Revivacense. I say , ' can i see in trade window ? ' ..of course as my predictions suggest, he replies, 'ND.' So I say thanks for looting then, and disband. <br><br>Ya know, I have no idea what its for -the dust. I can only imagine. I would have liked to found out before he looted, and had an opportunity to roll on it if it mattered. He never gave that opportunity to any of the group. Hes a class 'A' ninja looter. After I announced to the zone his actions to alert the prospective victims, he gloated. 'thanks for killing him for me binoche'...I also recieved many tells from people in the zone regarding his history. It wasnt a good one; people were not praising him.<br><br>If I dont see some action via the guild leadership here, I will post to the Lanys Shit List...this could be taken as a threat but its not. If he will not acknowledge his actions, I will let the community have their say about him. Whether its good or bad.<br><br>I can tell you , I had a hard time NOT posting to the SL without posting here. But I have preached too much about the SL and how its used inappropriatley.<br><br>Thank you for your time in reading this.<br>Feel free to contact me via email or ingame. <br><br>____________________________________________________________<br><br>I have since found out what the nature of the loot in question. I definitely would avoid this character, he seemed very remorsless about his actions suggesting he wont hesistate to do it again.<br><br>Im sorry I had to post here..<br> <p><img src="http://home.earthlink.net/~medicnman71/_uimages/1BaseSigBinoche.jpg"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ubolithonightshade.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bolitho Nightshade</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>w4nn4b3!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(1/29/01 4:10:54 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Laaw -  Iskar monk, ninja looter</span><hr size=1> If it makes you feel better the NoDrop item that came of the abomination is &quot;The power of reanimation&quot; and it is used for a Erudite/Human Cleric in Paineel.

I never knew about the post on the board untill I read your post here. <br><br>Sorry about the slow response.<br><br>Laaw has not been in the guild too long.  I have not seen any problems with him until this.  But as you said he has had a background with lower level characters.  This I will not dispute because I have no basis to combat it.  <br><br>What Laaw did was wrong.  I will see to it that I speak to him about his actions.  Not much more I can say about this other than sorry the whole event occured.<br><br>Riders has a really lax recruiting policy right now which is how members who don't follow and abide by the laws of the guild get into the mix.  Most of out members in the 35 to 40 range have been brought up in our younger guild Riders Chosen.<br><br>RC was formed ad a pre-screening method to recruit lower levels and bring them up into Riders.  The problem is that RotA and RC do not have a good communication with each other right now and we graduate members as soon as they hit 35 and don't find out if they really fit into RotA.  I think this is where Laaw came from.  <br><br>I guess this post overall is a message to both you and myself about RotA and to give us all a wake up call.<br><br>Thanks for your time<br><br>Danxor Danger<br>Officer of RotA<br><br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ubinoche.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Binoche</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://home.earthlink.net/~medicnman71/_uimages/healer.jpg BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>w4nn4b3!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(1/29/01 5:18:38 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://home.earthlink.net/~medicnman71/_uimages/BinRuby2.JPG WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Sorry for slow response</span><hr size=1> I dont fault the RoA for not checking their boards, running a guild is very tough indeed.

I also hate putting someone on the Shit List, and have debated doing so for the last few days.<br><br>I was in Unrest with a Shaman pulling from the second floor (Hand and Magus) when I 'heard' the shout from Laaw needing help in the barroom (I was the warrior you saw helping him).  A little bit later he came out to where we were asking for help with a spawn, saying it would be good loot and experience.  Now, if he would have said he needed to kill it for a monk quest or something of that nature, I would have helped him right away.  As it was, the shaman and I were already grouped and had our little niche on the playing field <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   and quite happy with it.  But, he kept asking for our help until I finally said yes and in we went.<br><br>It went downhill from there.... <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    We met on the second floor and he asked if someone had a GLS and to give it to him, wtf?!?  If he knew he needed a GLS, why didn't he bring one with him?  He never explained why he needed it, just that he did.  In my stupidity, I gave him one of mine to get the ball rolling.  Now he never said the stone would be 'lost' triggering the spawn (Abomination) although I suspected it would, but it would have been nice to have been told.  Let me say this; the GLS or it's cost really mean nothing to me, if it is needed for a group activity, I would gladly give it up.  BUT I would have liked to know why!!<br><br>After he triggered the Abomination, he started running around the house and grounds looking for it.  A little friend wanted to play (werebat) while he was doing so.  We get a /group from him saying he has found it and needs help.  After we finished playing with our new friend (it died <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :evil --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/devil.gif ALT=":evil"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ) , we went out to help him.  We found him fighting it (and some of it's friends), and helped him kill it.  I believe (although not sure, was busy at the time) that he dropped to loot it as the rest of the group was taking care of the friends.  He stayed there for a minute or two and looted the staff and dust.  <br><br>I knew what was coming next..  After a minute or two, he says: 'Have to go, brb.', ya right!!  Surprise, surpise..  Did a WHO ALL and found that he had logged.  I just love being in a group with someone who is just using you to get something they want/need, leaving you with nothing but a blank look on your face going, WTF!?!<br><br>Complained to my Guild and gave them a warning of his activities.  Found out he has an alt (2 accounts) or a friend that he runs around with; lo and behold, he was on.  Sent him a tell that Laaw was a rude a$$hole and due to his actions, owed me 6p for the GLS he 'stole' from me.  I received no response and after a few minutes, the alt had also logged.....<br><br>I know I will never group with this character again, and even if he is surrounded by nasties about to die, I will turn my back to him and walk away....<br><br>Harmitus of the 32nd Circle<br>Dark Reign<br>&quot;If it moves, kill it!

He was in his upper thirties at the time and I thought that was a pretty lame excuse to take all the loot. Other members in the group did not object for some reason and so the looting began. For over an hour he looted every mob before it hit the ground including the Frenzy that dropped a bloodstone ring (the non rare drop 3str 30mana ring). He eventually was asking the zone and our group to atm for him cause he had to much gold at which point someone said something to him about he was overweight cause he looted to much. He said he would stop but if we didn't loot the mob bodies within like 10 seconds of them dropping he was on top of them or bugging us about not looting them asking if he could. We were doing a need before greed group and unfortuneatly when the fbss did drop he won the roll against a 51 ranger and a 49 warrior when he was only like mid 30 level.

So seeing that he was several levels higher than I was, I assumed that he knew his stuff and defaulted the pulling duty to him. After two trains where he died (along with our shaman and necro) the rest of us all had to run for the zone, I resumed pulling duties. After he came back to get his corpse, he promptly disbanded and headed for WW. Not a good or bad report, just the guy seemed rather inept for a level 35 monk.

So he then narrowed it down to the silly necro that spawns there. Well and good. So we wandered up to the tower room for the Blood Stained Mantle, and Laaw shows up asking to join us. Well, didn't really need him, but that's ok, we invited him. He hung around and ninja looted about 2/3 of the kills then just left, no thanks, no goodbye, no nothing. We all just looked at each other and said &quot;?&quot;.<br><br>Like I said, I wouldn't make a brand new topic on this one, but he acted too wierd the one time I ran across him. Do as you will, but he is on my own personal &quot;Avoid&quot; list.<br><br>Bellrona Trueheart<br>36th season Knight of Truth<br>Vita Infinita <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ubellronatrueheart.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bellrona Trueheart</A> at: 1/31/01 2:26:05 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ufallenhero.showPublicProfile?language=EN>FallenHero</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>w4nn4b3!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(1/31/01 8:19:41 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.manorhouse.addr.com/images/ezboardpic.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Laaw -  Iskar monk, ninja looter</span><hr size=1> Laaw was the first person on my ignore list.  Out of a total of 3.  He's been there since I first encountered him a couple months ago in Unrest (in his teens level-wise).  I had a nice corner spot pulling yard trash.  He would train stuff to me, yell of a heal, then feign.  I could either heal and heal him until he'd killed it all, or get trashed by his train.  He did this many, many nights.  Even in his low teens he was selling and buying high-end items.  A 13th level monk with 2 trance sticks was pretty disgusting.  He KSed and trained his way across most of the zone before I gave up and fled to Kunark.  Laaw was only ONE of the many jerks that make me write off Lake of Ill Omen, but his upper-20s, low-30s antics there were identical to Unrest.  Ninja looting my stuff when I was fighting multiple mobs (I'm a Cleric, it takes me a while to kill stuff sometimes).  Training, KSing, spamming the /ooc and /shout channels...  typical Laaw behavior. <p><img src="http://www.manorhouse.addr.com/images/banners/fallen1.jpg"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/utardaan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tardaan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>p0\/\/3r-p0sT3r!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(2/3/01 1:56:23 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Laaw -  Iskar monk, ninja looter</span><hr size=1> Beware, friend of mine saw him liquidating his monk gear and looking for either pally or int/cha gear.
