The same two nuclear red con players from previous days were still lawn mowing down everything in sight. When asked what they were doing (Jeniver and Raie), they said they were farming to get their tailor skill over 192. We asked if they would let us kill stuff for EXP and for them to buy the stuff like a decent person would. I guess they took offense to that part, several noob references appeared in /ooc i didn't care for. They also responded we could leave if we didn't like it. We mentioned that we were going to petition, they said they didn't care if we did or not.<br><br>I wouldn't post here, except this was the 3rd or 4th day in a row this happened. I was a little pissed so I asked them who their guild leader was and if they would condone this behaviour. They responded that I was a noob, and that their guild leader would say they were right. I decided to confront their guild leader about this too.

Could Verant have implemented something better?  Yes.  Did they?  No.<br><br>They decided to farm EK because it's a relatively unhunted zone where they won't upset many newbies / twinks that want to level up.  There ARE other, and even better, places to level up then EK.  I'm sorry to hear you got the poky end of the shaft on this deal, but all you had to do really was to zone over the bridge into NK, plenty more to kill there.<br><br>I myself would've probably tried to work with you or something, but I would have had to have run around killing everything in sight if I were trying to farm silk / HQ cat pelts, whichever.  It's one of those things that you wish Verant could have foreseen and maybe implemented something better, but didn't.  Kinda like ye old Molten Cloak in Sol A, level 40+'s would camp the thing, not receive a single bit of exp, and the newbies would be fine because there were other and better places to hunt.  It's the same in your situation.<br><br>I'm not, however, agreeing with their method of HOW they were trying to own the whole entire zone, but they had to get those pelts or silks, and that's what they had to do. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/upennicollector.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Penni Collector</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.geocities.com/penni_eq/images/hrt.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>n00b!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(2/9/02 10:24:06 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumrantsandravesbalancingissues.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1683.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Jeniver, Raie and Nascosi of &quot;Twilight's Dawning&am</span><hr size=1> Ok, first the responce I am about to make is not about the alleged farming ( i'm not saying it didn't happen mind you, but that just isn't what my responce is about) .

( no, it's not hard to do, but I can't assume every log I see is altered or else there is no point in logging.  I am glad you cleared it up for me though, thats why I was hopeing you would post. )<br><br>As to posting an altered log ( if it was an altered log ) to the SL ( not that the complaint was SLable to begin with ), should be SLable within itself.  It's bad enough to come to the SL with a mere rant, but posting an altered log to support it? I forget who originally posted this here, :: insert that persons name here ::, that was not a nice thing to do at all.<br><br>Tarot, when you get back, PLEASE move this to rants. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   If this is a case where someone has started it with an altered log, i'm sure it's going to get deep. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br>Penni Souldestroyer<br>Druid of Tunare<br>Proud Officer of the Spirit of Norrath Guild.<br>Even Prouder Wife of Teazel Souldestroyer. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumrantsandravesbalancingissues.showMessageRange?topicID=1683.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumrantsandravesbalancingissues.showMessageRange?topicID=1683.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumrantsandravesbalancingissues.showMessageRange?topicID=1683.topic&start=61&stop=80>4</a><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumrantsandravesbalancingissues.showMessageRange?topicID=1683.topic&start=81&stop=86>5</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumrantsandravesbalancingissues.showPrevMessage?topicID=1683.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumrantsandravesbalancingissues.showNextMessage?topicID=1683.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumrantsandravesbalancingissues.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1683.topic&index=20><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/bluesparty/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumrantsandravesbalancingissues.emailToFriend?topicID=1683.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumrantsandravesbalancingissues.threadControl?topicID=1683.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumrantsandravesbalancingissues.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1683.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumrantsandravesbalancingissues.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1683.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub4.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="eqasylumgeneral">General<option value="eqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver">The Shit List <option value="eqasylumthetavernincharacterdiscussion">The Tavern <option value="eqasylumthemerchantsunionbuyselltradeorannounceyourservicesforhire">The Merchant's Union<option value="eqasylumcleric">Cleric<option value="eqasylumbard">Bard<option value="eqasylummonk">Monk<option value="eqasylummagician">Magician<option value="eqasylumdruid">Druid<option value="eqasylumenchanter">Enchanter<option value="eqasylumpaladin">Paladin<option value="eqasylumranger">Ranger<option value="eqasylumrogue">Rogue<option value="eqasylumshadowknight">Shadowknight<option value="eqasylumwarrior">Warrior<option value="eqasylumwizard">Wizard<option value="eqasylumnecromancer">Necromancer<option value="eqasylumrantsandravesbalancingissues">Rants and Raves <option value="eqasylumshaman">Shaman<option value="eqasylumthehallofhonour">The Hall of Honour<option value="eqasylumfrm24">Community Polls<option value="eqasylumfrm25">Raid Discussions<option value="eqasylumfrm26">Guildleaders' Forum<option value="eqasylumfrm28">Admin Use Only<option value="eqasylumfrm30">Gone for good... maybe<option value="eqasylumfrm31">Crafts Guild<option value="eqasylumfrm32">The Bored Room<option value="eqasylumfrm33">Luclin Info<option value="eqasylumfrm34">Beastlord</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#000033>- </font><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/beqasylum>Lanys Community Forum</a><font color=#000033> -
