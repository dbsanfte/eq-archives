<i>"If we had a list of everything we paid tax dollars for, we would all stop paying taxes. Along the lines of Lurikeen example, should I stop paying taxes cause the government is pro choice and dollars goes towards it?"</i><br>
<br>
Let me clarify my point since I see it is getting a bit out of focus. :) I understand we have to pay taxes for things that we do not support. However, I am saying that we should not sit by and let our government spend money on programs we find objectionable without a fight. Certainly, we should not allow our tax dollars to go towards programs we find immoral. Can we agree on that?<br>
<br>
<i>"My personal feelings tell me that if more kids did pray in school there would be alot less crime and violence."</i><br>
<br>
First, what is the big deal with vocalizing prayers in public for all to hear? Does it make the prayer more pious? Second, I doubt you would be open to giving equal time to all faiths and religions. Would you want a Satanist praying aloud in the classroom? Yes, yes, you will retort with the "majority" bit. Well, gues what... This is AMERICA. My atheistic tax dollars count just as much as your Christian tax dollars! I can care fu<i></i>cking less that there are more of your kind than mine. It really irks me when people lose compasion and hide behind the cloak of the Majority! I am sorry, my compasion for minorities of all kinds doesn't stop when my party has the oval office or congress. Or when those of my philosophical bent are in the majority.<br>
<br>
You don't want abortion, Rheaton. Then don't get one! You want prayer in school, then pray silently at your desk! Why in the hell would you want to impose your standard of living, your moral system, on me, or others who don't want them?!<br>
<br>
That is sheer arrogance and that is where most religious fanatics fail! They think their petty little beliefs are good for every single person on the planet. Guess what? THEY ARE WRONG! Your Christian faith is not mine and I don't want it! I will not work to eliminate your Christian sect, so why work to eliminate my freedom to not have to hear some school principal pray at a footbal game?!?! Why work hard to make my children feel uncomfortable about their own faith just because some little minded person HAS TO publicly pray in the classroom?!?! <p><center><font face="arial" color="CCFFFF">Lurikeen Mali'Kyre</FONT></center><center><table style='Filter: Shadow(Color=#150517, Direction=225)'><tr><td><span class='Necromancer'><font size=2 color="red" face="arial"><i>NECROMANCER</span></td></tr></table></font></i></center><center><font face=arial></center><center><I>"My eyes will pierce your soul, then I will take your life!"</I></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/urheaton.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Rheaton</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 185<br> <font color=#E9D756>(5/24/02 5:28:24 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=302.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Simple, Clear and Poweful</span><hr size=1> Its not really a matter of having to 'vocalize' pray in school as it is being able to is one wants to.

<br>
I’m not really sure why you are so hostile towards &quot;little minded&quot; Christians while so open minded towards other religions..?  Is it an underdog thing?<br>
<br>
Public schools, taxpayer funded schools, should be a place for learning the skills to succeed in life (math, history, english, science, etc.). Sunday school is a place where people go to learn about religious teachings. Most people clearly understand this. But what I contend is that religion should not be banned from anywhere in the US. If students want to take their lunch hour to group with friends and pray then they should be able to. 'Disruptions during class, regardless of its nature, should not be permitted. So in other words, if I’m in the back of the room during class whaling and moaning in the name of my religion, then I should be treated the same as someone causing a disruption.<br>
<br>
My personal beliefs about Christianity tells me that it is a GOOD religion and not own to be FORCED down ones throat. My personal beliefs do not stem or empower itself behind the majority but rather within my heart!<br>
<br>
I agree we should defend ALL beliefs in this nations..the majorities and the minorities. We should protect each and every one ALL equal and ALL the same. But we should not make special concessions for the minority just because they are the minority. For example: 10 people enter a room...eight Christians and two Muslims.  They all agree that the want to pray and worship their god...so they begin. Obviously the eight Christians are 'dominating' the rooms airwaves with their prayers cause the are the majority. Now Joe and Sally Muslim are offended cause they don’t want to hear the Christians pray. So they write their congressman, senator and president to tell them. The government, applying socialism to the event, pass a law forbidding anyone to pray in that room ever solely because it was not fair to everyone...BS! And that is basically what we have today in the public schools. <br>
<br>
EVERYONES right to religion should be protected! Their right to worship should be protected. The idea of restricting or banning ones worship cause it is 'unfair', when the majority wants it and wants it a certain way, sticks right at the heart of democracy.<br>
<br>
Anyway, ima lake bound!  Everyone please have a great Memorial Day and weekend!! Happy Birthday to anyone having one!! We are glad you are alive and with us!! (don’t ask why I said that)<br>

<br>
Would you want to hear a Satanic prayer?  Or a pagan one?  I think Christians are fine with prayer in school as long as it is their prayers.  <br>
<br>
Try to imagine how it must be to be a minority.  Imagine you move to Utah and are in a predominatly Mormon area.  While Mormons are Christians, their extra book changes and modifies a lot of the rules.  Would you want your daughter going to school and being told by her friends that she is going to Hell unless she converts to Mormonism?  Would you want her to listen to Mormon prayers every day?  Do you think she would feel comfortable saying her Babtist prayer in front of her schoolmates?<br>
<br>
School is an environment to grow and learn.  It is fine to have a religion, but when it appears to be sponsored by the school, it creates problems for the minority.  Just put yourself in the minority's place and think how you would feel if the roles were reversed.<br>

<br>
Generalities such as love, truth, discipline, empathy etc….. are acceptable in my opinion.  The above ’prayer’ brings attention to some very neglected issues.  The prayer has a positive intention however it does get a little too descriptive for the Non-Christian.  It does not cause a big social problem IMO.  If there were a much larger Non-Christian minority it might, but that is not the case.  <br>
<br>
Many times, moral issues aren’t clear because they are not by themselves doctrine.  They are doctrine when someone makes an attempt to specifically intertwine their personal feelings with some sort of logical philosophy.  I think if there were a Buddhist monk giving the prayer, he would have mentioned love and truth just as the Christian did.  In fact, it would be a breath of fresh air to see some other religion profess truth and love on an issue.  I think it would make Christians realize how far away they’ve gotten from such.  <br>
<br>
Unless your religion is on the warpath, there is little reason to mind anyone of any religion professing positive thoughts and feelings. What if a religion says, “sorry god, for we have not sacrificed a virgin to day, for all of them have been fvcked already”.   Obviously our laws do not completely protect the rights of everyone.  <br>
<br>
The most interesting thing I find in this arguement is the pride that is under attack.  People who take a nationalistic type pride in their religion, for example; &quot;I'm a Baptist, a follower of God's word and keeper of faith, kneel down brother and sumbitbefore you are cast into the depths of hell&quot;  NOW, for once, these c0cksuckers realize how damn stupid they are for saying such bvllshit.  These piece's dung might soon realize that they pray to their institution rather than God himself.  From a Christian perspective, I see these ignorant, institutionally brainwashed freaks as getting dose of their own medicine.  (I'm generalizing as there are these type of people everywhere)     <br>

<br>
Nobody is stoping anyone from being able to worship in school. What is often put to a stop is public presentations of that worship. Why? Because not everyone is a believer in the particular faith put on exhibition.<br>
<br>
Also, we can't do what we want to at all times. In fact, some religions require animal sacrafice (Santoria, for example) and they can't just slaughter a chicken at school while praying.<br>
<br>
<i>"If students want to take their lunch hour to group with friends and pray then they should be able to."</i><br>
<br>
Agreed.<br>
<br>
<i>"Now Joe and Sally Muslim are offended cause they don’t want to hear the Christians pray. So they write their congressman, senator and president to tell them.

<br>
It's not bullshit. It is common sense. The Christians, in your example, don't want to hear the Muslims' prayers to Allah any more than the Muslims want to hear them! Laws are passed forbidding vocalized prayer in the classroom in order to protect each and every person in the classroom. Again, I sure the hell don't want my children having to hear some small minded person vocalize a prayer. Yes, they are small minded, because if they were "big enough" they would know and understand that their god can hear whispers just as well. The only reason why they pray aloud is because of arrogance.<br>
<br>
<i>"I’m not really sure why you are so hostile towards "little minded" Christians while so open minded towards other religions..? Is it an underdog thing?"</i><br>
<br>
I apologise. I am not really hostile towards any religion. I am not very toleratant of the arrogance of many Christians (since I mostly run into their doctrines and way of life trying to encroach upon my liberties). A Christian who has to force thier way of life upon others is small minded. Rheaton, you have given me no indication you are such a person. I do apologise for offending you, though.<br>

ROFLMAO! Brutas, you are great!<br>

You know, I have no problem with positive affirmations delivered by a minister, priest, rabbi, or monk. However, this thread began with an arrogant Christian presentation that happens in real life all too often. I can't tell you how many times I heard prayers at high school football games that involved statements such as "This country has sinned against you Father" and then "forgive us, in the name of the Father, the Son, the Holy Spirit" achoo.<br>

Unfortunately, most religious fanatics, when given the soap box of public prayer, use it all to often to deliver a sermon. I don't want to hear the sermon. If others do then let them go to church on Sunday. <p><center><font face="arial" color="CCFFFF">Lurikeen Mali'Kyre</FONT></center><center><table style='Filter: Shadow(Color=#150517, Direction=225)'><tr><td><span class='Necromancer'><font size=2 color="red" face="arial"><i>NECROMANCER</span></td></tr></table></font></i></center><center><font face=arial></center><center><I>"My eyes will pierce your soul, then I will take your life!"</I></center></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <br><font color=#E9D756>- </font><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/bemarr>Erollisi Marr, The Queen of Love</a><font color=#E9D756> - </font><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18>America Under Attack</a> <font color=#E9D756> - </font> <br>
