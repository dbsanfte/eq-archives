It's entitled, "Define Troll, Somebody", and it basically takes the whole Jeverticus2009 issue and bundles it into one 7 paragraph masterpiece. Read on... and think of Jevert/Inviticus as you read :)<br>
<br>
<hr><br>
What exactly is a troll? In fantasy novels, it's a large, somewhat stupid creature that rarely bathes with poor dietary habits. In Everquest, it's a big cuddly critter easily mistaken for a sea turtle roleplayed by people who are training for a job running a Muppet. In nursery rhymes, it's a bridge dwelling monster easily outwitted by goats.<br>
<br>
And on message boards, it is a faceless demon with a sign reading "Ban Me" taped to its ass. Everyone knows you shouldn't feed the troll, and everyone does it. If in real life, you meet a troll, you ignore the moron and order another beer. But on a message board, everyone feels some bizarre compulsion to respond, to edify, to enlighten. Six dozen people take turns logically responding to the troll, and the troll responds to every post with some long drawn out manifesto from hell. When semantic nulls are removed from these documents, they boil down to "nuh uh, you stupid poo poo head." Anyone who has ever attempted to argue with a two year old or a congressman knows how futile the debate has become when the poo poo head pejorative has been unleashed. The only response to "nuh uh" is "shut up, you mouth breathing bottle baby before I go back in time and give your father a condom" and then everyone feels vaguely unclean.<br>
<br>
But what is a troll? Well, one definition of troll is "one who posts an exaggerated version of his viewpoint to create a reaction." Color me green skinned and warty, baby, because I don't just do that on message boards, I have an entire website devoted to that kind of commentary. When I say that agitators shouldn't be banned, though, I'm not just trying to cover my own ass. Most board moderators, when pressed and slightly intoxicated, will admit to hoping their pet trolls continue hanging around. Nothing like a bull headed, obstinate, opinionated asshole on your forums to really drive up the traffic. I don't have a single person like that on my forums. I have a dozen of those people on my forums. Wouldn't lose them for the world, either. The world does not have so many smart and informed people that a board op can afford to chase any away. So, agitators can't be trolls, because no one really wants to ban them.<br>
<br>
That sort of poster is usually frighteningly intelligent though. Maybe a troll is better defined as "a person who is not smart enough to realize when he is outclassed, and the sort of person who, if Galileo had put up an EZBoard, would have posted six hundred times with the message U SUX EARTH IS THE CENTER OF THE UNIVERSE." In all capital letters, that make me cry and mail people the caps lock key off my own keyboard. With a blinking sig file that takes two years to download. That links to a website with original MIDI file compositions. The problem with banning these people is the same problem the United States had when the Soviet Union filed for Chapter 11. When the members of the community do not have a common enemy, they turn on themselves. Not in any exciting displays of eating their young, either, but more of an endless bickering sort of thing. That's no fun at all.<br>
<br>
So the belligerent asses and the single celled organisms get to stay. What about defining a troll as "one who persists in only expounding his point of view with a total refusal to even respond to others"? These trolls are spooky. They remind me of the nice guys who walk around my neighborhood on the hottest day of the summer wearing neckties and sincere expressions with wide open smiles. They look so clean cut, so happy, so content with their role in this world. And then you look in their eyes, and find emptiness. Like they're being programmed by IT. (Oh, come ON, you have to have read A Wrinkle in Time. You people are breaking my heart.) When you take pity on them and bring them inside to give them water, they start reciting the same speech likely used in brainwashing facilities. No deviance from the script is permitted, and they have been trained to use circular logic to redirect anything you say back to the script. Eventually you realize that their eyes aren't completely empty, that there still remains a spark of life and all that spark wants is to grind you down into accepting their worldview. And possibly to outfit you with borg implants. But these board habitués also serve a purpose. Everyone else, when posting, makes a conscious effort to not be as much of a narrow minded asshole as THAT guy. One empty eyed repetitive dickhead automatically makes everyone else on your board a better poster.<br>
<br>
All right, we have to keep the jerks, the morons, and the children of the corn. Who's left to ban? Purveyors of foul language? Bah, there are some occasions where a good hearty expletive is the only true expression of emotion. People of questionable taste? One person's Rembrandt is another's Velvet Elvis. I could get ten strangers to agree on abortion faster than I could consistently define "tasteful." People who feel compelled to contribute to a discussion with "FIRST POST"? Now we're getting somewhere, but that might strike some people as too arbitrary.<br>
<br>
Looks like I'm going to have to keep going with defining a troll as someone who uses racial epithets, open misogyny, and xenophobia to obscure the fact that he has no argument, no point, and no validity. Maybe my definition of troll is too narrow, but then again, when I first heard the Billy Goat Gruff story, I was rooting for the troll. Annoying little goat bastards were probably pissing over the side of the bridge just to see what would happen.<br>
<br>

By the way, my 10 year old cousin likes to say baka too.  Her favorite sailor scout is Sailor Mars, which is your favorite? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
It's refreshing to see that people like you and Jevert can be clueless idiots about many cultures and languages, not just your own.  Jevert, the 'a' in French looks just like the 'a' in English... oh hmmm nevermind, that explains why you weren't able to read it.  I really don't care what country you're from as long as it's not mine, but please post the names of the schools you've attended so no one accidentally sends their children there.  <br>
<br>
I can understand why you flame, Jevert, I'd be angry too if I couldn't sit down.  Your ass must be very sore after that boys only 'camping trip'.  And I'm sure Inviticus showed you no mercy - is he the &quot;lights off&quot; type or the &quot;party till you're cute&quot; type?  Don't worry though, I know you're not homosexual.  But beggars can't be choosy, hmm? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   You'd much rather be with a woman, it's just that none of us can stop laughing long enough to go on a date with you.  The only reason you can look in a mirror without ROFL is you're too stupid to get the joke.  But, because I feel sorry for you, here's some free dating advice:<br>
<br>
1. Stop sniffing glue.  This hurts you in so many ways, from brain damage to that lingering odor when you leave some on your face.  <br>
<br>
2. Stop whoring yourself to Inviticus.  I know it'll be hard on you, and might mean the end of your friendship.  But in the long run, you'll thank me. <br>
<br>
3. Get a prescription for some thorazine.  This wonder drug will make you so much more attractive personality-wise. <br>
<br>
4. Buy your clothes instead of stealing them from a homeless guy.  And wash them.  Women love it when you wear clean clothes.<br>
<br>
5. Stop trying to give women XTC.  It won't work, the amount needed to make you attractive is far greater than the lethal dose.  I know what you're thinking, but sorry crack is also not strong enough. <br>
<br>
6. Pay for some plastic surgery.  Specifically, ask the doctor to give you something that resembles a face.  If you have the money you might want to buy a penis also.  <br>
<br>
7. Visit a dentist.  Many people do this once a year, or once every 6 months.  Either one is better than once in a lifetime. <br>
<br>
8. Learn to speak without slobbering.  Try practicing with language tapes, in front of a mirror.  Carry a handkerchief in case of relapse.<br>
<br>
9. Get your high school diploma.  It'll be 10 years of hard work, but it's worth it.  You'll be qualified for the coveted assistant manager jobs at all your favorite restaurants.<br>
<br>
Or to rephrase...<br>
<br>
Thorazine $300<br>
New clothes $500<br>
Plastic surgery $30,000<br>
Dental Hygiene $2,000<br>
Language Therapy $100<br>
Your first date, priceless<br>
<br>

As for taking the leathel amount of Crack,  I think you should ask your mom about it before triing.  I'm sure she tried it after squeezeing a 20 pounder that looked like a swollen cone-head out of her body.  I'm sure she thought about shoving you back in but the hemoraging stopped and lets face it who would want that amount of ugly inside them.  Take the Crack, O.D. and never post again.

Lamil you truly are lame.  First you quote the greats then you quote the not so greats.  I'd stick to quoting me if you ever really wanna go somewhere in your meaningless life.

<br>
Isn't it strange how, magically, thesicilan2002(sp) created <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> his</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> account <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>June 26, 2001</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END-->(If he isn't a cohort (or alter ego) of Inviticus, my name's mud)? And that jevert created his ezboard account <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> three days</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> after Inviticus (when he started needing backup - Inviticus = <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>May 21, 2001</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END-->; Jevert = <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>May 24, 2001</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END-->)?<br>
<br>
(What I'm trying to say, is that Inviticus=Jevert=KyuuketsukiWesley=thesicilian2002. Its too much of a coincidence for four of these assholes to A) Play EQ. B) Read these boards. C) Reply with the <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> same style and coherence</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> (or lack thereof). The relationship is way to obvious when you think about it.) <br>
<br>
Please. Don't debunk this with shit-flinging insults. This post is not for Inviticus, Jevert, thesicilian, or Kyuuketsuki. This is for the mature ezboard community to ponder over, not your lame-ass to gurgle at.<br>

I'm not married nor extremely sexually active (as depicted in your posts). Yet, I am able to type up a more literate, thought out, and logical response than your 34 year-old mind.<br>
<br>
Jesus christ, what kind of sick thoughts go through your mind as you drool all over your keyboard as you type your illiterate responses? <br>
<br>
Do you enjoy looking at kiddie porn? <br>
<br>
Do you like watching snuff films? <br>
<br>
Do you like to whack off whilst listening to your parents screw in the next room? <br>
<br>
Do you like slowly slaughtering animals and do you get a kick out of other's pain? <br>
<br>
Thats the kind of person I am seeing you as, Inviticus. And trust me, those warts all over your dick that you got from screwing the sick family dog for lack of a human target? You'll barely feel them when you're 50, so don't waste your hard-earned life savings by visiting a doctor. <br>
<br>
Why don't you get off your ass, finally venture out of your parents basement, get a job (you are NOT a &quot;made man&quot; - trust me. You wouldn't be bragging about it and misspelling the phrase at the same time), and do something with your life besides type up stupid shit to get a rise out of other people. <br>
<br>
Sure, sometimes its funny to see someone get extremely angry at someone's words. But its not funny or amusing anymore. Your insults have gotten extremely graphic and are just a rehashing of your old posts. You use the same phrases and cliches, all you do is substitute one word for another.<br>
<br>
At least come up with some fucking new material. You aren't funny when your vocabulary consists of &quot;fuck, slut, cunt, company men, THE FEW AND THE PROUD, gay&quot;. If you want to impress someone, get a fucking dictionary and try to use a little less profanity in your posts. You are easier to read when you don't have a swear word every third word. It doesn't make you look cool, despite what your imaginary friend says.<br>
<br>
I know that this post will just be answered with something from Inviticus like, &quot;U fuckin cunt ass bitch, st0p scerwing xentar adn getta L|f3 looser!&quot;. There have been so many well written posts by Starcharmer, Ice Weasel X, Vishanti, Valarye, Ript, Fiesti, and Nekiah (By the way, Zoisite, I *loved* the comparison to a house fly <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ), yet all you've done is berate them about their alleged sexual starvation, or brag about how you are &quot;made men&quot;  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
