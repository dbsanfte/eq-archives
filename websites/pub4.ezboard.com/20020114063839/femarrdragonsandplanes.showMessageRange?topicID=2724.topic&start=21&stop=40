<br>
Actually Ariakkas, I think it was the lack of allowing people to be greedy that caused some to leave *winks at Ariakkas*...<br>
<br>
EH was made bigger and stronger.  The merger with Aberation wasn't a mistake and I would do it all over again (especially if I knew it would cause you to leave) <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   We went to almost every zone a guild could minus the &quot;Uber&quot; zones like ToV and Sleepers.  Pre-merger we went to Mistmoore for raids...<br>
<br>
As for our policy to not allow trash talkin on our boards...It was allowed if it was productive.  95% of the time it was not.  It turned into a pissin match and lowered morale. As for Cryppte, I like the guy and miss him  The posting in this forum bothered me, no need to bring up our problems with a bunch of folks who didnt need to be involved.  So for all you RANT trollers get outta here you!  Peepin Toms!  Lookin at me bum, cheekey monkeys!<br>

<br>
<br>
  Oh god I love quoting ppl.  Ok where to begin, first off you poor little misguided paladin Caelie was never and has never been the leader of the guild.  We have never had a &quot;leader&quot;, and have always worked together as a council.<br>
  <br>
  Now onto the more interesting issues.. Me and Matt were the reasons eh?  Boy (I can call him that cause he's a little pizza delivering prick still living with mommy) you should really get your pathetic head out of your ass before you go flaming situations you haven't the intilect to comprehend.<br>
 <br>
   You want to discuss the reason a part of EH broke off and formed another guild.  6 &quot;friends&quot; started a guild, decided there was to be no leader that way there was never a most/least important founder. <br>
<br>
  That was in the begining, and things were good.  Untill we started getting larger, and some disputes happened. Most mind you were because one founder wanted it his way or the high way.  We made it through alot, and there were alot of good times to go with the few bad ones. <br>
<br>
  A merger with another guild was talked about between the officers and the guild.  We (as a whole) decided we should get to know them before we made anything official, and began raiding and grouping with them.  One person (a founder) had a conflict with one of their members, and like the childish brat he is, decided the merger was off.  He didn't take into consideration that not every one in a guild always gets along. <br>
<br>
  After several arguements, the merger was called off.  Everything would have been fine, untill I and some others were told we were traiters if we remained friends with the other guild.  Sorry Ariakkas dear, but unlike you I have my own opinion.  I dont sit around and wait to be told what to do, or who I can be friends with.  I chose to leave quietly mind you, after being told if I remained EH, I couldn't speak with my friends outside of EH.  I disbanded, and would have happily went along my way.  You see that wasnt what the other party had planned though, he figured if he left he could destroy the guild, and get sympathy along the way.  I have news for ya though.. SURPRISE we're still here!  Yes its been bumpy, but its been very adventurous along the way as well.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  i've kept in touch with a few people from the original EH, but eventually people show thier true colors ....*cough rugger* <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I just have one more thing to say.  True colors huh.  You dare speak of Rugger's &quot;true&quot; colors, like your's are pure.  We should ask Tryton what he thinks of you.  Your nothing but scum in my book, and your morals are pretty fooked up if you ask me.<br>
<br>
P.S. Sorry for the length and confusion of this post if you have no clue what were arguing about.  <br>

<br>
Firstoff: I'm no integral part of EH. Only been a member since LoM and EH merged. Therefore my word is not law, nor God's, like Trilok <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Now, since I joined EH I have noted it is one of the best Guilds I have ever been in. <br>
<br>
1) They WORK OUT differences. Not Yell them out.<br>
2) They have comraderie of the likes I have never seen in a Guild (as far as E-Marr goes).<br>
3) Everyone is nice, yes they may be acting, but anyone online can do that. It's the interpretation that counts. <br>
4) The one Guild Raid I could attend at level 42 I enjoyed completely. (WOOT! Kedge!)<br>
5) Several Guilds on the server respect us, and work with us. That tells me alot.<br>
<br>
Yes, they ask for people not to swear in Guild chat and the boards are set up so as no swear words are visible and come out as gibberish. I think in society that is acceptable. After all who swears around kids?<br>
<br>
I think for someone to try and air out dirty laundry on a board where most of the readers have no idea whats been going on is truely BAD FORM.<br>
<br>
To try and air out dirty laundry and tell others in EH to leave while they can......... well I have no words. Some people in the Guild have had no idea about anything like this going on, but I'm 110% sure none of those people will leave because of what an ex-guildie is saying.<br>
<br>
Now....<br>

<br>
<br>
neither the LoM merger nor the abberation merger were discussed with the rest of the guild, the council decided it. i thought both mergers were good ideas, and yes i agree trilok, we did go to every zone, and die. multiple times, over and over and over....<br>
<br>
the guild was better after you two left the first time, you came back, and the guild split, plain and simple. trilok ran everyone off, including poor old rugger, i'm sure we all remember the rugger/trilok thread on the MB.<br>
<br>
fiesti, you've had a hard-on for me since you made a bad call on a CoM raid and blamed me for not listening to you. the tide sure as hell turned when you weren't raid leader, remember SG, you would not sit your ass down and let other people do CR's, how many corpses did you have? the RAID LEADER told you to sit down and you didn't listen.<br>
<br>
feldynn, i liked the abberation people, the &quot;personality conflicts&quot; we had was that abberation was a guild of powergamers who were very skilled, put alot of time and effort into being good, and played alot, whereas EH was up-and-coming, people didn't have the time to commit, and didn't want to be an uber guild. we had a split faction, half wanted to be uber guild and raid, half wanted to stay the way we were.<br>
<br>
rugger, you disappointed me when you left UH and used me and my RL issues as a basis for you leaving, that was bullshit. 10 minuites after you left the guild i told the guild &quot; 10 bucks says he's in RE in a week&quot;, sure enough.  i didn't get you involved in my RL issues, YOU got yourself involved, you came and asked me, i didn't run and tell you, and none of it was posted on the UH MB. <br>
<br>
fiesti you can stop trying to make people think your so damn innocent. you manipulate people, you control EH with an iron fist, derrics pheno quest ring a bell? everythings gotta be your way, or no way. as for what tryton thinks of me, now YOUR talking about shit that you have no fucking clue what is going on, so keep this in game, and leave my real life out of this.<br>

p.s. i didn't leave when either merger happened, i didn't leave when the split happened, i was loyal to the guild until the guild left me hanging. i left when it was more important to the guild to get zzaz's epic piece then to help me with a quest when we were right outside the zone, for the people who didn't know, zzaz wasn't in EH. <br>

<br>
As for the guild breaking up after I came back, your memory needs some refreshing.  Everything was going really well.  Me and Fie had been back for at least 2 maybe 3 months before the shit hit the fan with the merger.  I have said this once and I will say it again...90% of the Council wanted to &quot;ask&quot; the guild about the merger but we were told by one of the council members that we make the decisions, not the guild.  Mistake number one...<br>
<br>
The people who couldn't handle the change left, after what I felt was flames being thrown carelessly by some ,I got fed up and did a little flaming myself.   I don't remember what I said and maybe I would take some of it back, who knows, not the point.  Me and Fie put EH into a position of greater power by taking the guild to the next level and recruiting 50+ members.  We made the guild stronger, so kiss my ass...<br>
<br>
As for your &quot;epic&quot; item... You barely started your epic and we had to return to kill Phinnie for the mages.  We didn't see the point of wasting an entire evening taking 3-4 groups in so you can kill greens and keep that piece in your bag for the next 6 months.  Zzaz was 100 times closer to completion and honestly I would rather have a Cleric with an epic then a Paladin.  As for him not being in the guild I guess you FORGET the countless raids he went on with us helping the guild.  What did anyone in EH do for him?  We didn't do his epic piece... so again...Kiss my ass...<br>
<br>
Fiesti...Fiesti ...Fiesti...you would dare even speak to my queen as such?  You worthless prick.  People respect Fiesti for her leadership AND her ability to make a call such as a CR the saves everyone countless hours.  She takes the personal sacrifice of dieing and not getting rezzed to recover bodies.  You would only be so lucky to one day meet someone that is <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> HALF</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> the woman Fiesti is...Once more...kiss my ass...  <br>
<br>
So anyhoo,  I have spent more time on you then I cared to.  People who know me and Fiesti know that we have done great things for the guild and we will continue to do great things for the guild.  You will never understand what its like to lead 100+ ppl.  You don't have the nuts to do what we did...You are, what we call in the hierarchy, a peasant.  We need peasants, I wont argue that, but you have forgotten your place.  Fall to my boots simpleton and clean them with your tongue!<br>

Take this however you want, I think you guys really need to take this off of the public boards and either drop it or deal with it in private.  You're making yourselves look bad and you're making EH look bad.  I've been though things similar to some of what I've seen posted here, and believe me when I say that the best thing was to keep it private and not bring it to the board or to the server in general.  I think the same is true of your situation.  Who are you helping when you post this stuff?  Who are you helping?  Those are not rhetorical questions.  Think carefully before you answer, and then keep your answer between yourself and the people who are directly affected.

Errr sorry but no we weren't.. there were as with most any guild some powergamers, but by no means was it a guild of powergamers.  I'd say at best maybe 25% of the guild were powergamers possibly less, yes there were a lot of highly skilled players there but only a few of us wanted &quot;it all&quot; so to speak.  I was in Aberration for a while before the merger and got to know most of em pretty well /shrug.<br>
<br>
As for Fiesti, sure she can be a lil err feisti?? hehe when it comes to CR's but I've never seen one go bad because of her willingness to sacrfice herself to get it done quicker that I can recall.  So far as her ruling EH with an iron fist and manipulating people goes, well I've never in my time here seen her do that or anything even close to it so I could quite easily claim that statement to be a falsehood.  And believe me if I thought I or anyone else was being treated unfailrly or manipulated I would be raising an issue.<br>

<br>
Stop all this now. This all started because Cryptte hates me for not being a power gamer. So what! So what if he thinks I held the guild back from raiding 24/7. Maybe I did. Maybe I spoke up to much and told him thats not what we wanted. Everybody was getting burnt out. Maybe he thinks I and my kind ruined the game for him. I have never really figured out why he hates me so bad other than I disagreed with him 95% of the time. I will have to give credit where credits due. He liked to play hard and wanted to see us as a guild play hard as well. He wanted to see the guild go places that we were capable of going and not hold back. For some of us, thats just not what we were looking for on a regular basis. I have fun playing alts. He didn't like members playing alts. We disagreed on just about everything, but so what! What was fun for him wasn't fun for me and what was fun for me wasn't fun for him.<br>
<br>
Fiesti is correct, I have never been leader. I only held the title a couple of weeks because the person holding leadership had some RL issues for a couple of weeks and we needed to promote officers.<br>
<br>
I joined Eternal Haven when Fiesti and Trilok were on leave. I don't know what all went down with the former leaders and some of the members of Aberration, I was pretty new to the guild as well. I know it was ugly, we lost lots of members and a couple of officers. Fiesti and Trilok came back,took over leadership (as a title) and really turned things around. I didn't get involved with all the politics (at that time). Things were great for a good while and Fiesti and Trilok took another break, but they are back now and in full swing again. Those two are wonderful people, so please don't get me involved in defending them. I might have to get ugly with those talking bad about them and I am trying really hard to maintain and not get ugly over any of this.<br>
<br>
The reason Cryptte posted here is because he posted it on our board, bringing up dirty laundry from 4 or 5 months ago and Moonblader deleted the post. Cryptte choose to post it here so it wouldn't get deleted. Thats why he titled it "Since EH has a culture of censorship". I agree it should have never been brought here, but this is where he choose to have his message heard. It doesn't bother me. People that know me, know I'm not an evil person. A little too opinionated sometimes but in general I'm a good person.<br>
<br>
I beg of you people to let this die. This was a post on what Cryptte thought of me and I see good people like Fiesti, Trilok, Rugger, Ariakkas and everybody else involved being trashed over nothing or what was something at one time is history now. I never said or meant to imply that all of Aberration were bad people. We still have some wonderful people that came from Aberration in the guild. I know some good people that came from Aberration that have moved on to other guilds. <br>
 <br>
There are going to be personality conflicts in a game of this size, but I can't for the life of me figure out why people choose to come to this board, the Rants and Flame section and talk about people they don't even really know. Everyday somebody is trashing somebody on this board.<br>
<br>
Now, with all that said please quit posting and bumping this back to the top. I would like to see it on page 3, 4 maybe even 7. Not because I am involved, but because it has turned into a flame of innocent peoples name getting thrown around like mud. <p>Caelie<BR>
