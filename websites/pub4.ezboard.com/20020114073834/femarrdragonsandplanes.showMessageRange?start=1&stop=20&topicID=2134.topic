Do you do it anyway when asking the guilds results in them laughing in your face?<br>
<br>
Do you have to kill mob_01 and mob_02 to get in on the rotation?  Thats how it is on my brother's server (Luclin).  A guild has to kill Gorenaire, Talendor, and Severilous in order to get into their VS rotation.<br>

I am willing to bet my friends and I, in a month or two, will be able to take down the bigger dragons of Kunark.  We are not guilded.  Some of us aren't in a guild.  Most of us are officers of smaller guilds.  Some are even leaders of smaller guilds.  Will we ever unite as one guild?  Not likely.  Will we ever get a shot at VS?  I think we should.<br>
<br>
If you think we should never get a shot at it for some reason, why?  Do you want to restrict people from feeling as important as you?  Do you want to stay on your throne with your uber guild tag, looking down at us little guilds or those who are unguilded and laugh?

The accepted way to get into the rotation is to find him up and take him out before one of the rotation guilds gets to him.<br>
<br>
The rotation is setup so each guild has 24 hours to kill VS, if they are unable to kill him within that 24 hours the next guild gets a shot.<br>
<br>
Ideally you kill him before another guild has arrived and is preping.<br>
<br>
Contrary to your opinion the rotation is very open to "smaller" non "uber" guilds getting in the rotation... the japanese coalition of guilds is a great example, they have been in the rotation for a long while now and are routinely one of the best in regards to manners.<br>
<br>
As with all gentleman agreements it has it's faults and occasionally miscommunication leads to ruffled feathers - but all-in-all the rotation serves it's purpose well  (9 months? or so and only a few notable ego explosions).<br>

<br>
The voices in your head are lying to you.  No one is out to get you.  The &quot;uber guilds&quot; are not &quot;the man&quot; trying to keep you down.  The rotation is how Cerulean explained it.  It is open to all, provided they can get sufficient force there and kill VS before whoever's turn it is.  It is set up this way so it does NOT turn into the dragon raids of yore.  If there were no rotation in place, then it would be a race of everyone that could and still had interest in killing VS as soon as he popped.  If that happened, he would never be killed because the zone would get so full that it would crash and KC would be unplayable (like that's a bad thing).  <br>
<br>
Bottom line:  with the rotation in place, you normally only have to worry about beating one guild to the punch.  If there were no rotation, you'd have to worry about beating everyone, and that infinitely diminishes whatever chances people have that have to put together a pickup raid to kill him.  While you are sending tells to all your friends, guilds are already porting to the site and prepping.  You may ask, &quot;Well how is it different from this in the rotation?&quot;  Good question.  Here's the answer:  By taking turns, the guild that is up for VS doesn't have to worry about racing other people (normally) so that gives others a better chance of getting their people together<br>
<br>
I am hoping that no one takes this post as deragatory as it's not intended that way, I'm just trying to paint a picture of what it would be like to not have the rotation in place and trying to explain that it is infinitely more fair than having one big race. <p><a href=http://www.afflictionguild.com/profile.php?username=Carathos&charactername=Carathos>Carathos Ollathir<BR><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/bthedruidsgrove> 60th Druid<BR> <a href=http://www.afflictionguild.com/>~Affliction~</a>

Oh, and we don't do /shout looking for *blank* *blank* to join *blank* raid.  We know exactly who we want and what their names are.  Sure, if one of our clerics isn't on we will start asking our friends for suggested clerics that are on line.  Its the idots who hear about the raid somehow and show up for some reason with their fellow idot friends that tend to make pick up raids go wrong.  However, I am yet to have a pick up raid go wrong or not accomplish the main objective.<br>
<br>
Right now we have at least 35 people 50-54.  We know how to buff, communicate, listen to instructions, and move fast.  Sure we use shout instead of guildsay, but we are no less affective than a guild.<br>
<br>
Those Antonica dragons are just a training grounds for the &quot;real&quot; dragons.  Correct me if I am wrong, but didn't all the other, now big, guilds rally Nagafen and Vox every once in a while?  They must have helped train you for the real ones.<br>

The lastest stink on DG wasn't because they &quot;muscled&quot; their way into the rotation. Its because they were in the rotation and jump him out of turn without making an agreement with PC who's turn it was. Which kind of defeats the purpose of having a rotation if everyone starts doing this. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/usharmila.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sharmila</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 153<br> <font color=#E9D756>(7/13/01 3:13:30 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: How do you get on VS rotation?</span><hr size=1> &lt;&lt;Correct me if I am wrong, but didn't all the other, now big, guilds rally Nagafen and Vox every once in a while?

After that, the guild must simply drop Venril Sathir.  At this point, that guild will be added to the Rotation and will be extended the same courtesy that the rest of the guilds in the Rotation have.<br>
<br>
As for a pickup raid taking him down, I really have no idea how that will work.  I have no doubt that eventually a pickup raid WILL take Venril Sathir down.  He's not too terribly hard, he just requires a very precise and organized strategy (although I have heard that the opposite works, throwing everything at him until he drops is a valid and used strategy.  It's a lot riskier but I know that it does work).  Once you and your crew gain some levels and strategy, you should be able to take him down with ease.  However, you will have to rely completely on people who are not in on the Rotation (this has been stated before, no member of the raid will be able to belong to a member in the current Rotation for obvious reasons).<br>
<br>
Like I said, I'm not really sure how it will work once a pickup raid leader gets his/her first kill.  Personally I believe we should decide now or very soon because it will happen (and probably sooner than we all think). <p>Islington Angelwatch<br>

I thought of something...  You all know of the Scale Keeper in the Hole, correct?  He is an exact replica of VS with a differennt body form, so I have heard (I never fought him).

<br>
1. Know when the next VS is and ask the guild doing him if you may have a shot. <br>
2. Try to kill him, and no, Nortlav is not 'exactly' like VS. He is slightly weaker. <br>
3. If you kill him, your 'pick-up' crew may be awarded a spot in the rotation, not sure how we would do it but there is a precedent in the asian guilds. They too are a conglomerate of many smaller guilds, similiar to a pick-up raid.<br>
4. Be prepared to have your pick-up people ready to roll. As soon as VS pops you have 24 hours before defaulting to the next guild in line. If you can't make it in 24 hours, you lose your turn.<br>
<br>
The info is there for you to use, please make use of it instead of trolling with your anti-uber guild sentiments. You are definitely not being 'cool' and are somewhat making yourself look like an ass.  <p><br><br><br><center><a

Our only real problem is getting all our people at one raid, so getting peeps within 24 hours *might* be a problem, but ya never know... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ucoreancowboy.showPublicProfile?language=EN>corean cowboy</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 133<br> <font color=#E9D756>(7/14/01 9:48:05 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Parum</span><hr size=1> some people = uber guilds ?<br>

<br>
Parum, 17 people taking down naggy pre-kunark (thus pre-50) *is* a big thing... and it is something to cheer about. How many peeps go on your pickup raids? 30, 40? <br>
<br>
Acting like the uber guilds of a server are all in on a huge conspiracy to take down all the &quot;less uber&quot; people seems to be a common trend. I don't know if it's envy, or if it's just blind hatred, or what. But acting like a paranoid newbie when dealing with upper end guilds is not the way to approach the situation.<br>
<br>
Think before you type, please. The deluded ramblings of a vox/naggy farmer ranting about the &quot;Uber-Guild Uber-MoB Monopoly Conspiracy&quot; makes for some fun reading, but not very influential in its impact, and makes you look like an dumbass in the process.<br>
<br>

<br>
Anyways, some of you clearly did not get the point.<br>
<br>
I believe things should not be reserved to the big guilds, like epics and uber mobs.  I will probably never join one of the guilds, and most of my friends will not ever join them as well.  Does that have to mean we will never fight toe to toe with Trakanon or explore Veeshan's peak?  If so, I am sure that ruins a lot of people's hopes and dreams when they started playing this game.  When I started, right after release, my goal was to kill the dragons (then Vox and Nagafen).  I completed that goal and it is time for me to move on...<br>
<br>
That is the point. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ulaoke.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Laoke</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 707<br> <font color=#E9D756>(7/15/01 3:29:48 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Parum</span><hr size=1>   Then good luck Parum, I wish you well.
