him during his time as president.  Was the response to 9/11 handled well?  By Mayor Juliani it was handled beautifully, and I applaud the man, he put in some major hours during that time, and kept the public up-to-date and informed about what he was doing.  Pres. Bush reacted with calling war on the world...now he's doing what he can now to further his promises (although there was that one little incident about the power plant promise, but we won't touch that)  And yes, the nat. budget got shot to hell (some more) but that's war, and I expected it from the beginning.<br>

<br>
I am NOT liberal anyone in RL who knows me knows that. But I do hate republicans. <br>
<br>
The looting of the Social Security funds is an example of what I hate. No they DIDNT have to do that. They could have raised taxes like every other war in history. But they never liked Social Security anyway, even tho Reagan still gets <br>
his check.<br>

Yes?<br>
<br>
You put in $10 today and get back $100 at the end of the month! Woo hoo. Works great until the bubble bursts. Every month you have to raise 10x the money you did last month to pay the 10x more people that joined, etc etc.<br>
<br>
Well, its not exactly the same, but social security is damn close in my opinion. People are now, and will be in the future, be getting more back from SS than they put in. Its that simple folks. Could you cover it if you invested wisely? Maybe. Its going to bust folks. Its just a matter of time. There are more baby boomers than tax payers younger than them right now... and they are creeping up on retirement.<br>
<br>
If you want to force an retirement supplement on someone, that is fine. (Since people have a hard time saving.) But make it a 1 on 1 thing. And give the poor smuck some control on how it is invested.<br>
<br>
As far as the political party affiliation goes, I don't care. All I want is a guy that is a straight shooter that is smart enough to surrond him/herself with people a lot smarter than him/herself. From there just make the best decision you can on the information you have. That's a leader. <br>
<br>
When George Jr. was asked if he got a DUI, he response was basicly &quot;you betcha.&quot; That's integrity. And the American people respected that and let it go and still elected him. People, no matter how good you think you are, make dumb ass mistakes. The real test of character is living up to them. <br>
<br>
Is he the best choice? Probably not. Good old Mr. Powell would have been much better in my opinion. (Another person with integrity and leadership skills.)<br>
<br>
I was in the Marine Corps during the entire Clinton reign. We, and I mean 99% of us, despised that man. But we kept our mouth shut because you have to respect the office and not the man. Doesn't say much for &quot;The Commander in Chief&quot;. Most people would not have wanted to follow that man to the 7/11. But we had to. Sucks, huh?<br>
<br>
Straight up, he was a dirtbag from the word go, and I don't care if he called himself a Democrate, a Whig, or a Confederate. The man was a disgrace to his people because he did not have the balls to admit when he was wrong, the balls to make hard decisions without sugar coating them first, nor the common sense that there are always people out there a lot smarter than yourself and you might want to &quot;surrond yourself with greatness&quot; as the Romans always said. (I know they fell, but that was a currency debasement issue and a totally different thread.)<br>
<br>
My point? Clinton was a mistake. I'll give him one thing - he put the nation in the black on the budget. (So he'd make a good Ferrengi on Star Trek.)<br>
<br>
Bush might be simple as all hell, but he's honest, he knows how to lead, he got the balls to make hard decisions, and he actually has respect from the people that work for him. <br>
<br>
One more thing, you will not see the effects that Bush Jr. has had on the economy for several years. Anyone that has read Economy 101 knows that.<br>

The reality is the Prez has a MAJOR impact. <br>
<br>
Why must we respect the office? It has been consistently miss-used by every administration since Coolidge. So why respect it? Respect the Speaker of the House, THAT is the man with the power. Not the Prez. <br>
<br>
People were employed mostly under Clinton. Alot more are not under Bush.<br>
That is my bottom line. I dont care what decisions Shrub makes. If he doesnt<br>

The message that you wont see an effect for years is a convienent way of stalling.<br>
It gives you more time to line the pockets of your buddies and make more conservative appointments. Thus we have Enron, Worldcom and general looting<br>

<br>
Manufacturing was up, equities were up. The dollar was strong compared to the Pound and Yen. Clinton seemed to be an apt businessman and a frugal planner.<br>
<br>
From an outside view Bush seems to very easy with the idea of war. I won't say trigger happy but he doesn't appear to have the tolerance that other presidents ( barring his father ) have had. This is not necessarily a bad thing as America has to be shown not to be weak but if you're going to say Clinton was a bad president because he chose a more diplomatic approach I'd say that was an error.<br>

I'll state this clearly for the idiots. This is an opinion. This is my view of the way this issue seems. If I'm off base on this one let me know. <p><CENTER><A HREF="http://ak.lonelygamer.com">

9/11 shook the american confidence pretty hard.<br>
<br>
Only on very few occasions have politics had any directly noticiable effect on the american economy. For the most part the economy is an independant entity with its own strong time and weak times, ebbs and flows. Most of these fluctuations come from the outlook of the investors. And since the investors are human, they let outside factors affect their judgements. <br>
<br>
The confidence shatter caused by 9/11 has some pretty long ranging effects, especially on an economy that was at the time on a slower pace than it had been.<br>
<br>
Winning a war would probably reboost our confidence, though I would be impressed if we can ever actually have a victory in this war. <br>
<br>
When politics do affect the economy the lag effect is 2-3 years. So the slowdown that was happening at the time of 9/11 would have been a result of Clinton politics if it was politically caused at all.<br>
<br>
If Bush's politics do manage to turn the economy around, we will probably see the results during the next Clinton presidency.<br>

Tell me Ghie, can you name ANY serious economist that has uttered that BS?<br>
That is Rush speak.<br>

<br>
But I don't know what rock you were hiding under last(or any) election year when every bloody economist in the world was saying that you couldn't attribute the economy to Clinton policy..it was all part of a growth pattern started by Reagan...<br>
<br>
I don't believe any of it. <br>
<br>
Most economist agree that any election will boost the economy. At the same time they agree that outside of sweeping reforms (which are nearly impossible in todays political environment) politics don't have much effect on the economy and it is in fact the other way around.<br>
<br>
The Economy effects politics. More precisely: we blame politics for the economy and a bad economy will result in political changes.<br>
<br>
The biggest factor that the president can play on the economy is how he talks about it. If the president says we will have it rough, the economy will stumble. If the president says we can expect to see significant growth...the economy will get a push upward...<br>
<br>
Those effects are immediate.<br>
<br>
But the time it takes for policy to effect the economy is 2-3 years, mostly because from the time a policy is announced to the time it takes effect is about 1-2 years.<br>
<br>
Most economists study the economy to see how we will fare in the upcoming months. Those that study politics are trying to make more money and sell a book or something. Economics is boring, politics are still boring but sell more books.<br>
<br>
The single biggest factor in the economy is the outlook of investors. If they are happy and positive the economy will improve. <br>
<br>
The second biggest factor in the economy is innovation. If something new hits the market that everyone has to have, that drives the economy forward.<br>
<br>
Presidential statements have an effect on the first of those two factors, but in the big picture it is the economy that affects the economy most, not politics.<br>
