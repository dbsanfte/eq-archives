In the book, it takes about 22 arrows to take Boromir down.  Which means that the orcs probably shot about 400 at him.<br>
<br>
The movie leaves out the fact that Arwen was a half-elf, and her choice between an elven and human life-span was based on that.  It was not something available to the other elven races.<br>
<br>
In the battle at the Falls I thought I saw a 1/2 second clip of somebody (Legolas?) dual-wielding thin swords.  Did anybody else see that?<br>
<br>
Wasn't Gandalf's sword (Glamdring) also an Elven blade that should have responded to orcs nearby?<br>

I have to say it is a good adaption to film, true to the original story, even got corrected in the matter of the vial Galadriel gives to Frodo. The vial has the light of the star of Earindil, who brought a Silmaril back to Valinor/the joint across the western sea, I had thought it was the light of Galadriel's radiance or something, poor recall...<br>
<br>
All the sets are outstanding. <br>
<br>
Arwen was cool, somebody already mentioned Tyler went over the top with the teary-eyed scene bit when Frodo has been wounded with a blade from Mordor, and a fragment is inside him, etc. Well, it didn't stop the movie in its tracks either. She comes over to him like a dream, glowing in golden light, some good film imagery there.<br>
<br>
I think the dulcet voice of Frodo didn't kill the story characterisation yet I still wonder that he now sound's a little effete, timid maybe? Nitpicking. Nevermind, the actor still carries this role well and the overall dramatisation is convincing.<br>
<br>
Re-counting the historic battle scene, through flashback, between Sauron and the combined armies of Elves and Men against him, avoided the black tension of the famous (and gruesome)Beach Landing scene in "Saving Private Ryan" or even the action in the opening battle of "Gladiator" or cinematography in the calibre of "BraveHeart". I had recieved the impression it would be more "immense". Even something to parrallel those.<br>
<br>
My impression now is that children would not have been allowed to enjoy the story beside adults. Had too much of an imaginative film portrayal been woven into the introductory spectacle of Sauron's dark power, and into the fullest depiction of his evil impact. The film introduction does, however, do the job of describing the story of the ring, foregrounding Aragorn's royal lineage and the Sword that was broken and how the ring finally came to Bilbo, in the present, and it is that which it was intended to do. It is, after all, about the history of the ring and Galadriel's voice-over is the narrator 1st person's voice giving filmviewers the story introduction. This parrallel's the storytelling process of the book. Which readers learn through the words of characters informing Frodo and the other Hobbits of the Ring's history. Thus the original storytelling process is intact. <br>
<br>
In reality, this flashback was a skimming exercise which didn't take deep root with my eager anticipation of promised imagery. But I will not say it represents a lost opportunity to do more with the film's impact. Rather I had been led to expect this scene achieves more dramatic impact than it did, when I finally saw it for myself.<br>
<br>
The soundtrack was great: Gandalf's fall, Frodo's lucky brush with a spear thrust from a Cave Troll, moistened some eyes in the audience, it definitely added more depth. <br>
<br>
The Cave Troll in Moria is both rich in its art concept and very effective indeed as a dangerous foe. Ultimately the Balrog itself looks sketchy (for a better word), the final confrontation in sorcery between Gandalf and the Balrog is a struggle of small proportions, compared with the ensuing cinematic dramatisation of the loss of Gandalf in its aftermath.<br>
<br>
Overall, the narrative atmosphere of an arduous journey through vast wildernesses, the scale of time and distance, as has been pointed out before, is a little rushed due perhaps to time compression and the fact that only 1/3rd of the story has been treated. I really had little to complain about of seeing the film.<br>

I'm going to see it again and again&quot; *eyes spiraling*<br>
<br>
I had tickets to the premier.  I didn't go in lieu of waiting for a certain someone to be able to see it with me.  <br>
<br>
We went last night and took my two boys.  Ages 5 and 3 1/2.  They sat through all three hours totally mesmerized.  <br>
<br>
Although a book is always the best, in this case, they did an AWESOME job of converting it.  Sometimes, it's nice to see all those places you'd imagined in your head come to life.  <br>
<br>
I'm wondering though...<br>
<br>
Now, I know that most fantasy/roleplaying games over the years have of course been inspired by the great Tolkien.  I noticed while watching the movie that there were likenesses to EQ that were really similar.  I was wondering, as I sat there, if Brad had been inspired by the Rings trilogy and also I wondered if the creators of the movie play EverQuest.  <br>
<br>
No rant up there, just pondering.  <br>
<br>
We were discussing on the way home that the ending was good.  Because all three movies have already been made, it left off at a good point.  If we knew we would be waiting for someone to pick up the ball to create the next one, I think I'd not be so pleased.  <br>
<br>
I'm not thinking &quot;sequel&quot;...I'm thinking honest-to-goodness TRILOGY.  It's like one big long movie this time around and for that, considering that this is one of my favorite stories in the world, I am thankful.  <br>

The right to choose the elves path is still hers: to leave Middle Earth and travel to Valinor in Aman, where she can live forever, or remain behind with a mortal and give up the one chance to sail away from Middle Earth with the other elves. Mortal Men cannot enter Aman because the supreme being forbids the Vala to bring men within their realm on Arda/earth, and he has destined men for a different fate from the immortals. <br>
<br>
The one exception is the soul of a dead guy: Beren gets offed by a demonic wolf, Luthien spins out a quick song to the Vala dude responsible for the passage of the souls of the departed. He does a quick deal with the boss Vala in Valimar - seeing as how upset Luthien must be to write for them a really sad song - they let Beren off the compunction of death just once, so Luthien gets a honeymoon and settles down. It's who you know...   <br>
<br>
Before Arwen Evenstar came Luthien, who was half-Elf and half-Maia (demi-goddess) on her mother's side: Melian the Maia, whom married a Grey Elf (Sindar)king. I think the elven name Beren(human) gave for Luthien is Tinuviel or something...<br>
Interestingly, Sauron is also a Maia, and originally Sauron served Morgoth, the Vala-gone-bad (parallel of Lucifer). The line of Eldalie human kings is descended from Luthien and Beren as also is the line of the half elves. <br>
<br>
When Luthien spots Beren and is smitten, she loses immortality... Their kid is named Dior, a daughter. Elf chicks have always gone for guys. Dior has Elwing, Elwing marries Earindil(human) and leaves Middle Earth for Valinor with her husband. Elwing was the mother of Elrond, and Elros, who chose mortality, and became the first King of Numinor. <br>
<br>
Earindil was allowed into Aman because he brought back a lost Silmaril which shone with the sacred light of the 2 trees which gave light before the sun was made.<br>

Its like they took 40 pages from the first book and made a 3 hour movie from it, and you can tell where they cut tons of stuff out.<br>
<br>
As far as the acting, they did very well. Graphics were awesome in most cases and the fight scenes were cool. But it drug on and on and on and on and on and on and on...you get my point. Too much stuff went unexplained, like Gand's connection to wildlife and such. Because the movie was chaotic fight scenes with tons of fluff in between it seemed like alot longer then 3 hours, to me atleast.<br>
<br>
So in the end, i bought 100 bucks worth of tickets for a bunch of soar asses.<br>
<br>
1-10, i give it a 3 for effort. It has major potential but i sure as heck wont see the next two movies til they are out on DVD.<br>

Dorien..as if we all want to see a movie explaining everything anyway.<br>
<br>
 Try explaininng some of that stuff to a non Tolkien fanatic and you will see how difficult it would be to sell in a movie. <br>
<br>
Since you happen to BE a total Tolkien Fanatic Dorien, you have the ADVANTAGE of knowing all those details already. Can't imagine why you would want to have em explained to you again , the movie was already long enough I think.<br>
<br>
I went to the movie with three other non Fans and had no problems. They agree the movie was long, but were impressed by all that was in it. My 6 year old sat through it spellbound. She was very impressed and didnt even notice the length of it.<br>
Frankly I was pretty impressed with that <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>Thorwald
