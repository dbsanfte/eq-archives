Here in Belgium they showed us this news , and then showed us a documentaire about seller who died as well .(murdered his mother and steph father , plus an employee)<br>
When you watch those tapes about that seller guy then you can truly see people might regret things they did in life even if it is murder and such .Wouldnt it be wiser to let them work for the community or so instead of killing them ? after all you guys pay taxes from prisons anyways , so why not let them work again ....<br>

<br>
For the record:<br>
<br>
Timothy McVeigh was NOT repentant.  He stated he was sorry for the death he caused, but not for his actions.  He also stated that he couldn't/wouldn't have changed his actions.<br>
<br>
He wanted to die.  He stated so multiple times.  <br>

Me, I'm just glad it's over.  I'm tired of hearing about it.  In the end, it was anti-climactic.<br>

     Another touchy subject in America.  Every once in a while someone gets boy-cotted because it used &quot;prisoner labor.&quot;  We sort of have a complex about slavery here.  We're not supposed to talk about it without whispering and bowing our heads.<br>
<br>
      Besides, most Americans are actually fairly understanding semi-reasonable individuals (I said semi).  As a group however, we're a sleek, well oiled, highly destructive blob of dumb-ass.  Most of the mob doesn't know any more about the case than his name and that something somewhere in Oklahoma exploded a while back.  You've taken the issue a little farther than most AMericans, and therefore, farther than our leadership would.<br>

As Caolfhion said, McVeigh was unrepentant, yet expressed the wish to die.  If you ask me, that indicates he's not sane.  If he's not sane, he shouldn't be killed.  However, many people feel that executing a killer brings some sort of closure.<br>
I have a lot of thoughts on this subject, but I don't want to start a flame war.  I hope that we of EMarr can discuss this topic without getting mad at each other.  It's really an interesting one, and I'd like to hear various arguments for and against the death penalty delivered in a calm manner.<br>

   There are evil people in the world, period.  These people don't care and are willing to do horrible things for whatever reason.  The death penalty is meant to be a deterent.  Unfortunatly most people on death row probably didn't care or think about it while committing the crime.  Its still there though and a reality,  getting rid of someone that has done such a thing is a benefit to society.  Are you willing to risk that he get a chance to do it again?

Collateral Damage<br>
<br>
Tim McVeigh used these words to describe the 168 people whose lives he took when he ripped the front half off of the federal building in Oklahoma City six years ago.  &lt;pauses to build up some good ol' fashioned profanity&gt; This motherfucker deserves (er deserved) to be thrown from the highest fucking building on the whole planet!  Shoot that bastard into space and throw his ass out in a deteriorating orbit so he re-enters the earth's atmosphere in nothing but a space suit and can watch his own ass get cooked.  Here in the US we have a clause stating that there will be no &quot;cruel or unusual punishment&quot;, but all I gotta say is you have to draw the line somewhere.  There is no punishment too severe for this type of individual.<br>
<br>
For background, I live about 10 miles from where they finally put this waste of oxygen down, maybe less.  We've had news media all over this place for a friggin month.  This morning, it was on every channel here, and guess what....last night I slept better than I had in months knowing that McVeigh was gonna get an intentional OD at 7am this morning. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ukerrolthefury.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kerrol The Fury</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>BazaarCop™</span><br>  Posts: 336<br> <font color=#E9D756>(6/11/01 3:44:30 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: way to go USA..</span><hr size=1> Timothy McVeigh was not executed for killing 160 people.

Because of the DNA testing funded by The Innocence Project in recent years (and in two instances, by state funding) MANY people who have spent years on death row have been found to have been innocent all along.  I can think of three off the top of my head in Illinois alone.  <br>
<br>
That fact makes me really wonder how many people have been executed who in fact were innocent.  Often in the pre-DNA days, and today when there is no DNA evidence available, a case turns on eyewitness testimony -- it's emotional, it convinces juries -- and science has consistently demonstrated it is inherently unreliable.  Under stress people get it wrong -- their memories, fears, impressions, even dreams all mush together and affect what they &quot;remember,&quot; or sincerely think they remember.  That is but one of many good arguments against the death penalty -- others include that similarly situated cases aren't treated similarly because whether to seek the death penalty is left up to the discretion (some would say whim) of individual prosecutors.<br>
<br>
That said, there was no doubt about McVeigh's guilt, or his total lack of repentance.  To the end he was writing about what he did as a &quot;legit action&quot; of a military nature, and the deaths of 168 people (19 of them children under age six) as &quot;casualties&quot; in his personal &quot;war.&quot;   The thought of one dime of my tax money paying to keep this waste of oxygen eating, breathing, laughing, talking, writing makes me sick.<br>
<br>
The day science gives us a brainwipe technology so sick bastards like McVeigh can be rendered harmless to society is the day eliminating the death penalty will be seriously considered in America, in my view.  But for what it's worth, a lot of very thoughtful people, including survivors of the Oklahoma City bombing and the families of some of the victims, were opposed to the death penalty in this case, as they oppose it in general.<br>

Jaeden you want to see McVeigh seriously punished, well that is just, but you must remember that the sniper that shot both of the weavers a child and a mother nursing her infant got an award when no hostile activity was warrented.<br>
<br>
As for waco, what the hell is america coming to, using tanks on civilians, oh and flamible CS then following it up with gunfire into the house, a little overkill.  But I digress<br>
<br>
Yes McVeigh should be punished, but not in this fashion all the government is going to do is create a martyr for the loose nuts out there.  If they really wanted to stop all the foolishness around him they would have kept the gag order on him and locked him in prison for the rest of his life, remember charlie manson, or Ted Kazinsky, thought of as loonatics now arent they, just some random thoughts. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uraedwulf.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Raedwulf</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 109<br> <font color=#E9D756>(6/11/01 4:19:07 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: way to go USA..</span><hr size=1> 1.  Executing someone is more expensive than keeping them in prison for 120 years.  Lots of necessary safeguards in place so that we don't execute an innocent person.<br>
<br>
2.  We have executed innocent persons in the past.  Is vengence really worth the lives of innocent persons?  Is it truly a good thing to make more victims?  (McVeigh had family, too.)<br>
<br>
3.  It is not a deterrent.  Every major study that has ever been done has demonstrated that it is not a deterrent.  Our conservative Attorney General John Ashcroft has finally admitted this only a month or so back.<br>
<br>
4.  If you aren't a spiritual person and want to punish a murderer, why give them the easy way out.  Stick them in jail for the rest of their lives.  Jail is a massive punishment.<br>
<br>
5.  If you are a spiritual person, shouldn't everyone be given the chance at true repentance?<br>
<br>
If it isn't a deterrent, costs more money, creates more victims, is prone to error, and cheapens the &quot;justice&quot; system, why are we doing it?  There are lots more reasons to do away with the death penalty.  After reading everything in favor of it (on this board and elsewhere today), I haven't read any valid reason to keep it.  Vengeance is not good enough.<br>
<br>
Count me as one American firmly against it.  I don't much care that the few other Western countries have abolished it.  If the other countries jumped of a bridge . . . ? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ubulvyne.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bulvyne</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 90<br> <font color=#E9D756>(6/11/01 4:24:08 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: way to go USA..</span><hr size=1> I believe in the Death Penalty in certain cases...<br>
<br>
1) Where the convicted is, without a shadow of a doubt (as in McVeigh's case), guilty, and <br>
<br>
2) Where the punishment fits the crime. Easily, murder of any kind would fall into this category, and I even see it possible to place some other seriously violent crimes into this category, as well (rape, especially repeat offenders. Child molestors, especially repeat offenders, etc.)<br>
<br>
To me.... Mc Veigh was 100% guilty. He was totally lacked remorse for what he did. And, he wanted to die.<br>
<br>
So... in conclusion... it would cost taxpayers more to keep his butt alive for the next 60 years than it did to extinguish his life.<br>

<br>
Ok, he admitted he was responsible, he showed no repentance and he is about the most deserving person of a death sentence I can think of.  However, executing him actually gave him what he was looking for.<br>
<br>
Personally, I would have preferred he be castrated and then made to do hard labor.  <br>
<br>
The death sentence is a touchy subject everywhere, in the UK we currently have only one crime for which the death penalty is still a viable option, and that is for treason.  Death penalties are permissable in my view, but it means that we should be sure we are not executing an innocent (however McVeigh admitted responsibility).  <br>

<br>
Repentance & remorse are too personal to gauge... and thus, to me, should not be considered when dealing with a proven criminal.  Is his/her remorse genuine?<br>
<br>
His/her repentance does nothing to take back the pain caused, the lives taken, the money wasted, or the time spent by law enforcement.<br>
<br>
The process of punishment concerns the act done and the victims made by it - not how the perpetrator feels afterward.<br>
<br>
I'm dead set against the death penalty because we as a nation have killed far too many innocent people in the name of vengeful justice - I forget the exact figures but they are staggering.  Even executing one innocent person is far too high of a cost.<br>
<br>
As someone stated above we in America have a complex regarding slavery... but that is basically what I think should happen - forced labor, hard labor, painful, dreadful labor.<br>
<br>
I believe in castration for 3rd time offenders of lesser acts.<br>
<br>
I'm left leaning in nearly all my beliefs except crime & punishment. <br>
<br>
Crime deserves punishment - not rehabilitation.<br>

This is a confirmed fact of psychology and studies about crime and punishment.  A jurisdiction with light sentences and a high level of catching the offenders will have less crime than an area with harsh sentences but relatively light enforcement.  Think of your 6 year old.  He is less likely to do something that gets him a harsh word if he knows he will get caught vs. a very bad thing which will get him spanked, cutoff from Barner or whatever is harsh punishment if he is pretty sure he will get away with.  That does not change with age.<br>
<br>
The biggest reason the death penalty is not a deterrant is that most people who commit capital crimes do not think they will be caught, and think if they are caught they will not get the death penalty, and even if they get the death penalty they will win on apeal or take 20 years to get executed.  So to me that is not the fault of the death penalty, it is the fault of the system that catches and then administers the punishment to the criminals.  <br>
<br>
Same argument for the cost of the death penalty.  I am all for the due process of the law and the highest standards of justice being observed to do everything possible to make sure someone is guilty.  That does not mean it will always work out.  We probably have executed innocent people.  All human justice can do is try to minimize mistakes, we will never eliminate them.<br>
<br>
I wish as a human being I could have enough compassion and love for others to forgive someone if they did something like this.  It is not humanly possible for me, and I shamefully admit it.  I pondered what it would be like to actual be able to forgive every sin against me and others, and was staggered at that thought.  Makes you wonder about so called perfect forgiving love, and whether such a thing exists in a creator, but that is another thread altogether.  Point is, I cannot reach that level of enlightenment.  Perhaps the Pope or the Dalai Lama is closer, but they cannot deny their humanity, and even they get angry.  So, I want punishment, and I (and America as a whole) am willing to risk punishing the innocent on rare occassions to kill the guilty for crimes deemed sufficient in the eyes of society to merit it. Npt perfect, but the majority support it, so it stays.<br>
