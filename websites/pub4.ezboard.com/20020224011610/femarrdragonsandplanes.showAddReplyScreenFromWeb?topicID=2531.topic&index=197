Sure this member did something that is frowned upon by the community and the crime they committed was wrong...does this mean we give them the death penalty and cast them out of our lives forever or do we endeavour to right the wrong that they committed and then rehabilitate the member so that they then become a better person.  Based upon most views on this board I can see why people become outcasts in our own real life communities very quickly.<br>
<br>
I understand that whatever my view on this will be quickly scrutinized and I too will become a victim of your rules and regs and be quickly thrown out, too many of you have proven that already.  What was originally a rant at ONE member quickly became one at an entire guild.  There are people here who don't really care how other people react to this sort of thing, they see it as hey I am right (and in ways you are) so therefore I can make the only judgement on this and everyone elses opinion is rubbish.<br>
<br>
I don't agree with what Medicuus did, and I am sure as hell that they are regretting having done it.  I know that Medi has lost alot of friends across the server due to this action, and that to me would seem a fitting punishment in all of this.  How would you feel knowing you lost a reputation and alot of friends?  However everyone seems to think that someone carrying a guild tag around as well has not had their sentence handed out in full.  Why?!  <br>

<br>
To me, this is not saying anything is right or wrong once again, there is a difference between and opinion and an action.  I hate Halflings.  Plain and simple.  When I turn my opinion of them into training / KS / ninja looting from them, it becomes an entirely different matter.  Shard and Ram's opinion of your woman is nothing that really deems action, in my eyes, regardless if they are accurate or no.  However if they purposefully trained her, I would hold their actions as up to par with what their guild tolerates.  Just, once again, an observation. <p>Lemming Twin of Slayne™

I dunno how VI can make these decisions.<br>
<br>
 Hello,<br>
After investigating this further and speaking to most of the people that<br>
were around at the time, I have decided that my original decision will<br>
stand. From what we were told and could verify, the person who looted the<br>
item was not warned that the corpse was not his to loot. We also had been<br>
told varying information from the people making the claim. Without<br>
undeniable proof and the fact that the corpse was &quot;open&quot;, the person will be<br>
allowed to retain the item.<br>
<br>
Sincerely,<br>

my response (i am pissed and this guy is an idiot)<br>
<br>
This is a quote from your companies posted policy:<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/support/policies/conduct.jsp:>">everquest.station.sony.co...duct.jsp:></a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
Ninjalooting is defined as taking special equipment from a fallen creature without the express permission of those who killed the creature if they are in attendance.<br>
The purpose of this rule is to stop those who stand near creatures that carry special items and attempt loot that equipment prior to it being looted by the rightful owner.<br>
<br>
Who gave Medicuus &quot;express permission&quot;? I am going to post on my guildboard to see exactly who you talked to who was in attendace. Noone posted that you contacted them.<br>
<br>
This was a creature it took more than one group of people to kill on a guild raid. We were standing around the body and randoming the item when someone ran up started clicking the body. Who gave Medicuus &quot;express permission&quot;?<br>
You say we are supposed to warn people corpses is not theirs to loot? How and when do we do this? Every time we kill something should we have a macro saying we have killed a monster and not to ninja loot it? Do you actually<br>
play this game and know how the mechanics work? In multiparty encounters the corpse has to become open so the winner can loot nodrop items.<br>
<br>
If this is your final decision i would like to speak to someone higher up.<br>
I don't know why you won't follow your posted policies.<br>

<br>
Larger guilds can not understand the family bond that smaller guilds share.  I would like everyone to look at their own family for a second (RL family that is) and ask yourself would you make an outcast of your brother or cousin or sister or uncle or whatever family member you want to choose just because of one mistake that this person has made?  If you said yes, then I think you are a much sadder person then the people you are criticizing.  I am an officer in my guild and if this situation was to arise in my guild I would definately give my family member and oppurtunity to apologize and would keep the punishment inside the secure walls of our family much like RoD is attempting to do now.  If the guilty party didn't want to accept the punishment that our officers felt fit the crime, then and only then would I remove this person from our guild.  I believe RoD has done what they can to make ammends.  It is none of our business what med's punishment is.  If you choose to not group with this person because of her actions that is fine, it is your choice.  If you choose not to associate with RoD that is fine, it is your choice.  From what I have heard in this thread I am still not 100 percent sure it wasn't just a simple mistake.<br>

This is not meant to be mocking flame, but just checked from RoD website their memberlist and counted 108 members (including probationary members too though).<br>
<br>
Don't know about you, but that doesn't actually go under my definition of a &quot;small family guild&quot;. <br>
<br>
And no there is no actual point in my message.<br>

Curmy are you so blinded by your hatred for MS that you can't see that the GM's are ignoring POSTED VERANT POLICY?<br>

Thank you, for with each and every consecutive post you make, you show me just how much more of an idiot a person can be. <p>Jaeden Grae<br>

If you mean &quot;less powerful&quot; guilds, I can tell you that guilds of ANY size or &quot;power&quot; can and usually do grow &quot;family feelings&quot; simply from operating with each other on a regular basis. MS is no different. I would be that their &quot;family feeling&quot; might be just as strong as any other guild's. So I believe that they can and do understand. Does that mean they'd stick up for someone if they did the same thing? Maybe, maybe not. Depends on the guild in question, not guild-size or how &quot;strong&quot; they are. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
As for Curmy... he's an obvious troll, and it's so blatantly obvious, I get a good chuckle from some of the replies to him, and from him. It's always easy to target the &quot;big boys&quot; (in this case being MS), and start a nice flame. He's probably getting more enjoyment out of coming here, acting like a fool, and getting a rise out of everyone than anyone else here. <br>
<br>
Suggestion: don't let him get a rise out of you, and he'll go away. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

As for the incident, it was definitely unfortunate and uncalled for. It goes against Verant policy. It's pretty cut and dry, and the Verant employee you contacted obviously just didn't want to take the effort to remedy the situation following their own guidelines. Perhaps whipping out a reply to you was easier for that person than actually going in and removing the item from Medicuus and then going through the effort of explaining it to her/him. Like they say, &quot;It's easier not to change&quot;.<br>
<br>
I would still recommend pursuing it, higher if you can. Verant has to be held accountable for their own rules. If not, then pretty much anything is up for grabs, and all they are doing with their &quot;rules and regulations&quot; is wasting web space.<br>

I'd suggest that you are the one that ought to reconsider your actions in this thread.  Simply ignoring the many ways you inflated your accusations on numerous occasions [the original lie, the claim that others supported your &quot;defense&quot; of the lie] is hardly succeeding in a discussion.  The button pushing goofiness is also very overplayed.  When you can come up with something original and accurate, give it another shot. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/upurtyogre.showPublicProfile?language=EN>purtyogre</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 126<br> <font color=#E9D756>(10/16/01 9:41:41 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2531.topic&index=213>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Mendiccus of R.O.D.</span><hr size=1> I only mean smaller in number not power.  I truly have no idea how many people are in MS.  I only assumed they were larger because of all the many things that they can accomplish.  My comments were not directed at MS but to all the people that are commenting on this topic.  It was only my opinion of the situation and the way it is being handled.  I also only derive my opinion on first hand knowledge.  I was once with a guild who was very tight but as we grew in numbers we lost that bond.  Then when a few of the core members left to create another guild we found that bond once again.  <br>
<br>
I was only trying to illustrate exactly what some of the people are asking these guys to do, and to think if they would truly handle it in the way they are posting.  If I had to guess, I at least got my point across to you, because at least you asked the question.<br>

<br>
Glor... I don't mean to be rude, and I apologize if it sounds like I do, but that E-Mail isn't going to accomplish anything. I don't doubt MS is lying, and Medicuus was definently in the wrong... but it is all heresay. If they gave the tailsman back to MS, it would set a nasty precident opening the door for many people to come whining to guides and GMs when they thought they were entitled to something, but without proof.<br>
<br>
Innocent until proven guilty I suppose, but I'd rather a guilty man be set free than an innocent man imprisoned.<br>
