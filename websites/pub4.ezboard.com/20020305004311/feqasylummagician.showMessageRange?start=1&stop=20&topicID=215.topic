You have the best pets in the game, and can already chain summon.<br><br>If you could root, it would trivialize most soloing encounters for mages ( especially if the mob didnt summon).<br><br>All mages would just make sure to chain cast root on a mob to keep it rooted, then chain cast a pet ( which at 200 mana is probably the most efficient form of damage you have... one of the most efficient in the game ).<br><br>Mage pets &gt; necro pets.  necros cant chain cast their pets due to the long refresh and cast time.  Necro pets also cost a lot more mana.<br><br>I honestly think root would overpower mages in the solo game.<br><br>Things i think mages should get :<br><br>1. being able to summon a decent set of armor at level 60.. something that would be comparable to a set Sol Ro quest armor for the melee classes.  Would make re equipping a wiped out group fairly painless in their quest to get their body.<br><br>2. Being able to summon a decent, no rent, haste item for a melee ( like 20 percent ), also at level 60.  Most melee will have better by this point, and yes it would be used to twink , but it sure would be nice for point 1 above.<br><br>3. Being able to summon some sort of robe for themselves By level 60.  Mabye something with +5 int or so, nothing &quot;too&quot; special, but again mages can re equip melee but not casters.<br><br>4. being able to summon a decent weapon ( see point one, for CR.  The weapons before were tuned when the max level cap was 50, and the best weapons in the game NOT off gods were yaks )<br><br>Nifty things that would be cool :<br><br>A group of mages being able to do some sort of mass summoning elemental golem or so.. like a group of mages focusing their will into a mass elemental pet.  Make it have like 6k HP and hit for 100s or 120s, but make it NOT healable or something.  some reason for a group of mages to be on the raid and do some extra damage.<br><br>More specific resist summons... resist summons that fit in range or ammo slot more.  <br><br>One ( bad ratio ) lure type spell.  Let mages nuke the same mobs that wizards can nuke, just at a much worse mana / damage ratio.<br><br>/shrug.. off topic here... but i dont think mages need root.

(if u think about it, does root really help a mage solo?)  other than pets, we have no ability to survive an encounter.  and i doubt anyone would summon a pet each time they zone.  (that argument that cicely brought out about monks/warriors/wizs die with multiply green mobs, thats lame too.  those 3 classes can survive way easier than mages.  it would also take &quot;alot&quot; of green mobs to take those classes out.  lets say 3 mobs aggroed the player.  warriors should have enough time to zone since they have ac/hp and 3 green mobs &quot;shouldnt&quot; kill them (unless they were naked), wizs have buncho spells to aid themselves and like what u said about that wiz dying in dl, it was probably more than 3 mobs and why didnt he/she use shadow step since its an outdoor zone?. monks shouldnt die too fast with only 3 green mobs and should give them enought time to do fd again several times, but what about mages?  with 3 aggroed mobs, pets will take one and the 2 will be on the mages in a second.  then what?  chain cast pets? lol how are u suppose to do that?  also that agrument about classes having certain spells are pretty lame.  apples and oranges. talking about something completely different.  giving a mage the ability to root wont make them &quot;uber&quot; classes.  i see root as a way to survive without pets.  and besides, when was the last time our earth pets root actually worked?  i know i already asked this but how can root help us solo better? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  and about all those summoning suggestions...sorry to say but they're kinda lame.  at those high lvls, when do those guys actually do cr?  usually they wait for a cleric to res them.  in fact, i dont remember when the last time a group member did a cr.  and that idea of having a group of mages summon a huge pet, not bad but not neccessary either.  a group of mages is better with their individual pets than having one pet.  why have 1 pet with 6k hp doing 100-200dmg a turn when u have 6 pets with a at least 2k each doing at least 100dmg a turn?  not only that, if one pet dies, the mage can just summon a new one while the mob aggroes a different pet  (thats how 2 mages can solo rottgrime in ot <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   oh yes about the raids thing, use ur 1 time pet rage of zomm or something.  it poofs after target dies so no bitching from others saying &quot;control ur --- pet&quot; (oh ya, u'd need a target to cast this spell so its for sure u wont make a wrong assist since cast time is kind long giving u enough time to duck and switch targets)  the only thing i dont like about this spell is recast time, so verant if ure reading this change it please <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  i think i wrote enough and yes, i'm bored right now <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ullorianlanys.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Llorian Lanys</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Board Whore</span><br> <font color=#000033>(1/18/02 7:29:29 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylummagician.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=215.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.mindspring.com/~suretang/images/usf2.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ^_^</span><hr size=1> I cant read what your saying without paragraphs Joclen.<br><br>Not trying to be mean, but i just cant read it. <br><br>I got about 5 lines in, and to the part where you think mages should have root for excapability.  While YOU might not use it for solo, you can bet that 90 percent of the mages who got it would.<br><br>Just because a spell is intended for escapability doesnt mean the smart player base wont figure out different way to use it..... and root is actually one of the most powerful spells in the game.<br><br>Even summoning mobs wont summon if they are rooted, AND there is something in melee range.  If a mage could root, any mage with decent chain casting timing could solo almost any single mob they could stand out of melee range of... with the exception of mobs that hit for 300s or something.<br><br>Gooey Goo is a poor substitute, since it must be farmed, and therefor couldnt be used as a way to solo grind experience now.<br><br>Root WOULD overpower mages, especially outdoors ( if they had it as a spell in their spell book ).  This is just like snare would overpower enchanters.  <br><br>I dont know how many mages have enough gooey goo to try and solo large outdoor mobs ( because the tactic would be to keep it rooted and root is fickle ).<br><br>As for the point of &quot; i can do that now&quot;.. well yes you can chain cast pets now, but the difference is, root would trivialize it. Anything that didnt summon would be so simple a 7 year old could do it.  Things that DID summon would be slightly harder, but only require more chain casting expertise.  Mobs can only summon every 10-20 seconds or so, depending on the mob.  If a mage could root, he/she could still get summoned, run out of range ( its rooted ) then cast a new pet.<br><br>As it is now, if your trying to kill a summoning mob if your pet dies, your pretty much history ( unless you have some gooey goo in your backpack ).<br><br> <p><a href="http://www.mithrilweb.com//"target="web"><img src="http://www.mithrilweb.com/images/sigs/llosig.jpg" border="0"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uskwinkjonez.showPublicProfile?language=EN>SkwinkJonez</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.sunvalleyproducts.com/jpf/SJicon.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>n00b!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(1/18/02 10:24:50 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylummagician.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=215.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Can Mages please have root?</span><hr size=1> My main is a magician and I agree with those that say we should not get root or snare spells.<br><br>I would, however, like to see our pets get a little better taunt.

It would empower it.  But no overpower.  <br><br>Lets compare.  What can a necro do with root?  Dot Root is common.  Pet recast, Dot, root.  Crowd Control.  Beyond that, the necro can use things like fear and so on.  So soloing power, we would actually be slightly less powerful still.<br><br>What can a mage do.  The ONLY way I could abuse this, is by rooting and recasting.  Which yes, would allow me to use root with pets other than the earth pet.  I see that argument.  But since the air pet stun sucks ass (I haven't seen it stun a green yet) the new fire has a 5pt dmg sheild and hits like a newbie, and the water is a rogue and seems to have the same hit points what's the problem there?<br><br>Now, it would allow me time to recast.  Ok.  I'll give you that.  A couple of extra seconds to med.  This is something necros, enchanters, wizards, druids, shamans, clerics, rangers, paladins, and shadowknights do.  Hell I often get told to root things by those classes anyway.  "Root that." "I can't" "Really?" "Yeah."<br><br>My arguement is that post 50, we have to traverse the same territories others with root do.  We can't have a pet up in all zones.  You can't argue that Verant thinks that's part of the challenge of being a mage.  (The fact that in Seb my pet needs to take a freaking tour of the kitchen to find a mob 2 inches from it's face.  That's simply a ROLE PLAYING device right?)  Basically I'm tired of gating from every some what dangerous situation that any other class wouldn't worry about. <br><br>Again.  I think the root wouldn't overpower us.  It would give us something in exchange for the constant crap we do now.  Spend a day with a druid or a necro and then say we can solo well.  I don't think root is too much to ask.  It could even be a high level spell.  Just an escape route.  Something to give us the extra 2 minutes to get out of range, and survive instead of shelling out cash for rezzes when we our sows ran out and invis didn't last.  (Those 5 seconds it takes to recast Veil, had better be in a safe spot)<br><br>I understand your arguments, and it's not like Verant would give it to us anyway.  As Gamrok suggested.  Verant's vision of the mage is a summoner.  A summoner of crap with a 12 second I hope you live CoH spell.  I love the mage.  But I see root as an improvement.  As a gift for the crap we aren't allowed to do anymore or can't.  As an apology for Druids getting better nukes that hit more consistantly.  And for that damn fire pet.  (Which if anyone has a good use, please tell me, I'm not planning on buying the 58 Fire pet.) <p><center><img src = "http://www.ilstu.edu/~djmorg2/RRlogo2.jpg"</center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ullorianlanys.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Llorian Lanys</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Board Whore</span><br> <font color=#000033>(1/18/02 11:14:38 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylummagician.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=215.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.mindspring.com/~suretang/images/usf2.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Can Mages please have root?</span><hr size=1> I dunno what verant was smoking when they made mage fire pets post 50, honestly... they are horrible and an embarrasment to the mage community.<br><br>Now.. I dont play a mage ( well i occasionally play my bro in laws level 50 mage ).. so i am sure there is some feeling that i dont know what i am talking about..<br><br>But i also have been around mages for a long time.  One of my best friends ( now retired ) was a mage by the name of emmin luckbringer.  He used to do things solo that would amaze me.<br><br>Part of the problem with pets in general is that when the game capped at level 50, pets were overpowered.  At level 50, when the cap was level 50 and warriors had yaks etc.. a mage PET could kill a level 50 warrior.  The mage didnt have to lift a finger.<br><br>Verant basically tuned down the power of pets, by not increasing them 50+ very much.  There isnt a whole hell of a lot of difference in the 50+ pets to the 49 ones.. in some cases ( thx fire pet ) the 49 is FAR superior.<br><br>/shrug.. i dont think we are going to agree on Root.  I see enchanters make the same arguement about wanting &quot; &quot; illusion : death&quot; ( ie FD).. saying it would help them escape since enchanters generate so much agro etc etc etc.  That would be so overpowering to the enchanter class ( more than mages getting root ), it would be silly.<br><br>Since we arent going to agree about root, how about trying to come up with other things mages could use ?<br><br>I gave some suggestions ( and yes i think mages need some help in the 50+ game, especially in the 55+ game ).<br><br>The Biggest 2 i would like to see would be a form of lure ( make it poor mana to damage, just let mages be able to NUKE like they were before ), and some form of group summon that was extra powerful.<br><br>It would be really kick ass to have a group of mages focus and summon some giant , kick ass elemental thing that hit for 200s with 6k hitpoints that exploded after 2 min or something.  It could even be balanced if no one could heal it.<br><br>belive me, i know how boring casting mod rods is.. well i can guess. its probably about as exciting as twitching a cleric ( which i do on my necro ), or casting c2 and haste on a raid which i do with my enchanter.  Booring ( but necessary ).<br><br> <p><a href="http://www.mithrilweb.com//"target="web"><img src="http://www.mithrilweb.com/images/sigs/llosig.jpg" border="0"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uruanolikm.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ruanolik M</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>n00b!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(1/18/02 12:28:30 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylummagician.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=215.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Can Mages please have root?</span><hr size=1> I honestly don't have a problem with Mod Rods, CoH and such on raids, but I'm also in a small enough guild where things where I'm doing malosi, DSes, and nuking on occasion (when I have them mana.)   I'm also in a small guild and often the only mage on it, and I like it that way.  It keeps me busy and keeps me creative.  <br><br>Where I find myself lacking is when I'm trying to move to somewhere to group or solo.  Or those situations where a friendly (lol) druid decides to drop his failed quad on top of me.  Any mage can tell you.  One mob you can handle.  Two mobs if you're really careful and your pet can take one.  Three?  Gate or die.  <br><br>I really don't think it overpowers me.  I think honestly we are so underpowered and a lot of people still think we are over powered and bitch.  Goto a necro bitch board, and you'll hear them say we get better pets.  Which we do.  But we also don't have the extra spells that MORE than make up for that loss in pet power.  <br><br>I just want a reason that root would overpower me and I'll drop it.  I don't want to suggest any other improvements because Verant WILL give that another class.  Mages said in class balancing that we don't get nukes at certain levels.  Verant said yep, neither do necros.  So when Luclin came out, necros got them nukes.  WTF? We asked for pets that give us other benefits, like clarity or something.  You're welcome wizards.<br><br>All I want is root.  My rant is over.  I think I made my point.  Maybe a few non mages will read it and at least think we aren't the GODS they think we are.
