<br>
Since when was a war conditional?  Or are we just saying that to sound righteous?  It is dangerous to call this a Pearl Harbor when our grandparents went 5 years for all or nothing.  In the same breath, CNN seems to put a litmus test via a poll question not a week after this tradgedy.  According to the early spin, soft toilet paper and coca-cola taken its toll two generations after WW2.  Horrible to think that a back-pack nuke in LA or a poisoned well in Atlanta is not at all impossible.  It is naive to think that such unspeakable things can't happen:  It is unacceptable to have this occur again.  <br>
<br>
WARNING: STOP READING HERE IF YOU THINK CAPITALISTS ARE BAD PEOPLE, YOU EAT TOFU LOUNGING AT A POOL, AND STILL RIDE ROLLER SKATES AT 50 YEARS OF AGE!<br>
<br>
BIN LADEN is Satan's Apostle and the TALABAN are the Devil's Children dancing the crooked path.  If you think I'm harsh - then maybe Hitler, Stalin, or Pol Pot are also misunderstood folks.  Mass casualties through hateful physical violence cries for sustained action not, love-child, flower-power sympathy for these butchers who circumsize their women.  Sarcastically - Diplomacy has failed, lets try diplomacy again, and again until no-one takes us seriously and we look stupidy and blame someone else.  It's always someone else - Like BIN LADEN.  <br>
<br>
IT IS MY FAULT and YOURS fellow Americans, not the other guy.  We are so busy being self-centered fighting each other, we welcome our worst adversaries into our houses.  In effect, we have psychologically enslaved ourselves and we have no one to blame.  I am sorry I failed the victims in New York and the Pentagon by not using common sence and telling our elected officials to do the same.  As a GEN-Xer I take responsibility, and I pledge to make it right, as long as it takes.  There are still some hippies that are nostalgic for their Jane Fonda days, now in power with ties and that silly pony tail at our nations capitol. Grow up you hash heads. I say, stop cornering the market on political correctness.  PC is in direct violation of Equal Opportunity.  As soon as you treat someone more or less special because of Political Correctness Abe Lincoln is spinning in his grave.  Bin Laden always derived his power from Satan and was a butcher like those in the Balkans.  But he got special treatment because some nations glorified him and did great spin.  We fell for it, or we were affraid to do what was right.  Deep down I own up to that, scared about what the international community would think.<br>
<br>
What hippocracy to talk about lifting assasinations.  Are we in Hollywood Wolf Blitzer?  No assasinations nice 60s buddy!  War by its virtue does not take into account assasination as such.  And we shouldn't dabble into lifting it partially during peace time.  Huh?  Right.  Let's have an endless dialog to discuss this in the X degree and blah blah blah in all the Poly Sci classes in college - Already makes me sick.         <br>
<br>
Consider:  The Mongles were successfull in Afghanistan because they didn't screw around with symantics.  I would think it comforting for a GI to know if they died early in the campeign, it was not in vane.  It would be a Vietnam travesty if politics and polls intervened in getting the job done.  So which is it - all or nothing.  I hear it already, the intelligencia 60's fuzzy wuzzy 'salon communists' say its all a shade of gray.  But these folks never saw the real human suffering by joining the Armed Services did they, they just spit on servicemebers and now have the gaul to spin conditions repeating the cycle.  Stand in the middle of the road and your run over.  Believe it or not I cut a ton of inflamatory stuff out already.  <br>
<br>
As a qualifyer, since someone may be PC and get my bippy deleted (fuzzy wuzzy mental anguish stuff - words hurt more than a bomb, ect.) I would wager to say I am in the upper 50 percentile as far as having done things like nation building (get my drift).  As John Walsh would say, lets get these guys, every last one, even if it takes 5 years and over 1000 body bags.  I may soon be one of them. If you are one of those, put-a-flower-in-the-rifle two years from now, waveing a peace sign, you will never forgive yourself for betraying your country men and women.  Yes, history has an ironic way of repeating itself - as you proceed in making rambo movies to forgive yourself.  Stop pointing fingers at the CIA, Dr. so and so, point the finger at yourself because your spare the rod has spoild the child - Take a clue from Dr. Spok.    <br>
<br>
I will light a candle 10 or 20 years from now for everyone in the world when it is a truly a safer place - that is my commitment.  I choose to let my stand agains terrorism burn deep down inside.  Since Bin Laden mis uses good cosmic power then I don't see why I can't.  Hamurabi's law.  By the way, for us white trash types, I say BACK TO BABYLON: Let us take our ancient city back from Hussein. The fire I feel may drive me to shave Satan's Apostle, let him enjoy a pork dinner followed by a relaxing pork grease bath, and swiftly hang him on a high holy day for the corpse to rot in public as his father lucifer demands.  Flame away, just ignore, or support.<br>
<br>
I'll take an american jew, christian, muslim, agnostic, or hindu anyday over our adversaries.  We must stop feeling so bad for everything in the world as if it is all America's fault.  Let's stick together for the years that our grandparents would expect us to.  Remember 11 September 5 years from now should body bags come back.  There you have it, Gunkle.               <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/usmashgnome.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Smashgnome</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 246<br> <font color=#E9D756>(9/16/01 8:29:28 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> reply</span><hr size=1>  Gunkle, it will take a Backpack nuke killing 2miillion+ to wake up America and send us into WW2 &quot;I'm ready to really sacrifice ALOT of troops to win this war&quot; mode.

Talaban<br>
Taliban<br>
Taleban<br>
Taluban<br>

So which is it..considering even Afghanistan spells its differently from time to time?  Might want to check it and see if you can clear it up before you flame someone for a word that appears to have many different spellings.<br>

If we don't do something drastic to end this, now.. There will be another bomb, at another time. These guys are out for American blood. Because according to islamic fundamentalists, we are the big Satan.. So they will continue to bomb us every few years whenever they get a clean shot as long as they are around. Why do I believe this? They've done it before, we didn't get rid of them, then they did it again, and we almost took care of them, and now this huge attack on America, that has taken more lives than Pearl Habor did..<br>
<br>
And you people that say, let's not get in a war cause people will die, need to wake up and see people have died, and are still dying. And not acting is as bad, if not worse, than actually going through an extreme measure to end the attacks by these fundamentalists..<br>

You know in the koran it says that if you die in the holy war, you will go straight to a mansion in heaven. The bible doesn't say that. Nor does any other theology preach that suicide is a way to get to heaven, please feel free to point out any examples if you come across any.<br>
<br>
So those bleeding hearts out there that say war is bad, because people get hurt in war. Stand in front of Bin Laben wearing an I love my country T-shirt with an American flag on it, and see how long he let's you live. So that you can see how serious this fucker is. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uelnotssadnes.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Elnots Sadnes</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 117<br> <font color=#E9D756>(9/17/01 5:48:04 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> whoops</span><hr size=1> In a flurry of typing strokes, I didn't word my opening sentence correctly...<br>

Anyone got a reference to where in the Qur'an (or Hadith) this is?<br>
<br>
Here's an interesting discussion about what the word &quot;jihad&quot; actually means: <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.irshad.org/islam/iiie/iiie_18.htm">Jihad explained</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->, and how and why it is translated as &quot;holy war&quot;.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>
 &quot;Let there be no compulsion (or coercion) in the religion (Islam). The right direction is distinctly clear from error.&quot; (The Holy Quran, 2:256) <br>
<br>
&quot;...of any organized attempt to force the acceptance of Islam on the non-Muslim population, or of any systematic persecution intended to stamp out the Christian religion, we hear nothing. Had the caliphs chosen to adopt either course of action, they might have swept away Christianity as easily as Ferdinand and Isabella drove Islam out of Spain, or Louis XIV made Protestantism penal in France, or the Jews were kept out of England for 350 years. The Eastern Churches in Asia were entirely cut off from communion with the rest of Christiandom throughout which no one would have been found to lift a finger on their behalf, as heretical communions. So that the very survival of these Churches to the present day is a strong proof of the generally tolerant attitude of Mohammedan [sic] governments towards them&quot; (Sir Thomas W Arnold, Christian Missionary, 1896).<br>
<br>
 &quot;Fight in the cause of Allah against those who fight against you, but do not transgress limits. Lo! Allah loves not aggressors. ...And fight them until persecution is no more, and religion is for Allah. But if they desist, then let there be no hostility except against transgressors.&quot;<br>
(The Holy Quran, 2:190, 193) <br>

Yet again it is shown that these terrorists are disobeying their own religion.  As far as I know the US hasn't been agressive against these guys for a while.  Last I checked, the US has only been agressive with these guys when they pull a stupid stunt like Tuesday.  I heard a quote a couple years ago, can't remember where I heard it, but it is prevalent in my mind nonetheless...<br>

<br>
Nonetheless, it happened.  And these acts will continue to occur unless we intervene now, make no mistake about it.  We MUST show terrorists and those who back them that we stand against them, and unfortunately, the only lesson these particular individuals understand is death.  That is the only way to stop these individuals, for they are afraid of nothing, and will stop at nothing.<br>
<br>
I AM an American fighting man, and I am prepared to give my life to defend the freedoms of our people and our way of life.  Today, tomorrow, forever.  For I love this country with all my heart, and I want my children to enjoy the freedoms which I have for so long taken for granted.<br>
