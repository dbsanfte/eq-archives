I dont remember but thats usually what Sagemon does, often within a few hours.  In the wrap Goht was all but directly accused of taking the book.  <br>
<br>
Now, there is nothing but circumstantial evidence, both against and for Goht.  There is no way to prove, or disprove his innosence.  So you guys are leading this crusade over a realtively easily attained item based on what? second hand hearsay, rumors, and an inconvient RL interevention that looked rather incriminating. <br>
<br>
As it was mentioned before, if he planned on &quot;ninjing&quot; the book, why would he leave right after? If that was the case he wouldnt care about his rep much.  But aparently he does cause he has made an effort to deffend himself.  <br>
<br>
So, if we are gonna trash peoples reps based on rumors and circumstantial evidence, I heard Sage cybored Torm behind Vet's back.  <br>
<br>
Hope you dont fall off that pedestal Sage, its looking awefully tall from down here. <p>Birren Anklebiter<BR>

But what I put in my post as a "rumor" was clearly defined as such. <br>
<br>
I simply stated the facts. <br>
<br>
So there Ne Ner Ne Ner, Ne Ner. <br>
<br>
The reason it keeps going on and on is that with the facts that do exist It's hard to deniy one rather probable conclusion. <br>
<br>
It is easy to hide the truth in lies, suspision and finger pointing. But make no mistakes the fact's a laid done are just that nothing more. <br>
<br>
<br>
Some people would have me believe that if Goht can not be proved guilty beyond the shadow of a doubt then he is innocent. That is a childish thought if I have ever heard one.   <br>
<br>
*note*<br>
There was a substanal pause around 5-10 minutes RL between the time we clear Mystreo's room/ upstairs confirmed it pressence and when the book was found missing.  <p><BR>

Sagemon says: <br><br>
<font color=yellow>And Jex, you didn't want to believe that Duec would do something like this, did you? It turns out that you really didn't know Duec as well as you thought you did. Guess what? You don't know Goht that well, either. I'm sorry if that pisses you off, but everyone needs to remember that online friends are not the same as people you actually know.</font>	<br>
<hr><br>
I said prior: <br><br>
I cant base an opinion well enough to say that I know he wouldnt have done it because well... I've been fooled before. </font><br>
<hr><br>
Obviously I realize this... Im not saying that Im certain he didnt do it, Im not saying he did... Im just trying to say that there's one string of lies on top of another... FROM BOTH SIDES.  Which is one reason why I dont think that there's a true reason to accuse him when there have been more lies (in my opinion) from the "victims" than the guy who's being accused of being a kniving thief.<br>
<br>
Im not saying "forgive him" you can choose not to let him be on your raids because of YOUR opinions, but why slander him and ruin his rep more than that when you have no HARD evidence against him... it is a game, people make mistakes... its not that big of a deal... let it go already either way.  If he fucks up and does something to ruin his rep later... let it be, chances are he isnt going to risk it.<br>
<br>
Yes, indeed, the circumstances point right at him... I'll agree to that 100% but you still have no proof... and I really dont know why its SO important to drag his name around about it when the book is apparently NOT that difficult to get.<br>
<br>
As far as lying about the loot messages and what not it makes me wonder why if there is, in fact, so much proof... why would someone have to be so devious about trying to pin the blame on him???<br>
<br>
Either way... Im not all trusting and noble and I dont trust half of the people I come across in a day of game play but that doesnt mean Im going to go all out of my way to fuck over the people who may have irked me the wrong way.<br>
<br>
Jumping to conclusions is a bad thing to do... but at some times chances are you can be right.  The fact is you cant legitimatly PROVE that he did or did not steal the book... so WHY keep it up???<br>

<br>
Jex, no one told the CoKs all of the bullshit that they're spewing in this thread.  They're just making it up to try to deflect attention from Goht.  Go back to Kit's post and to the old thread on D&amp;P and you'll find the facts laid out for you.  Most of those facts can probably be confirmed by 20 to 30 people, and Goht and his pals aren't denying any of them.  The story you heard about a loot message is just a false rumor that started somewhere.  It didn't come from us.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Which is one reason why I dont think that there's a true reason to accuse him when there have been more lies (in my opinion) from the &quot;victims&quot; than the guy who's being accused of being a kniving thief.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

<br>
Jex, have your read Kit's post laying out the evidence?  I'm sorry if Goht is a friend of yours, but he's guilty as hell.  Do we have a screenshot of an invisible rogue looting the book in an area with no other players?  Of course not.  Would the GM take the time to find out who looted the book?  Sadly, no.  Do either of those facts mean that there is no legitimate proof that Goht stole the book?  Hell, no.<br>
<br>
If you really believe that Goht was just innocently wandering away from the raiding party <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> in the Plane of Hate where there are numerous wandering mobs</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->, and if you really believe that Goht just happened to have an ISP problem moments after it was discovered that the book was missing and that the raid leaders were petitioning for a GM to investigate, and if you really believe that Goht went to Hate on Christmas morning with a wizard who he cannot name . . . well, then maybe you also believe that Santa Claus came down Goht's chimney that morning. <p>Sagemon Prayeth<BR>

Honestly Sage, even if he did loot it, its not that big of a deal, its not hard to get the book.  <br>
You havent heard any circumstantial evidence for him?  Go reread jex's post.  She said he inquired about getting the book and how to go about it.  Thats just as legitimate or illagitamate as the case me be, as your accusations against him.  OPEN UP YOUR EYES.  <br>
Is this book really worth trashing someones rep when you have no way to prove they took it? Is it? Is it really? Its not that hard to get.  <br>
I am not here defending Goht to defend a friend.  I am here cause you are unjustly fucking with someone's rep when you cant prove shit.  Unfortunately enough people trust you enough that you can severely damage somones rep.  I am not saying he didnt take it.  I am saying you can prove he did, therefore you are unjustified in causing this crusade against him.  <br>
&quot;Circumstantial? yes it is. So what.&quot; -- Toein <br>
So what? its someones rep you tard, you shouldnt trash someones rep without being 100% positive your right.  A bad rep can make life very difficult.  <br>
&quot;In the end none of its important anymore. Alarah holds her Blade. Goht has ruined his own reputation. &quot;  --- Toein<br>
<br>
Goht didnt ruin his rep, Sage and Torm did.<br>
If it isnt important, why the hell did you post, and why the hell are poeple on this crusade against goht? <br>
Sage has yet to show anything more substantial than what Goht has shown.    <p>Birren Anklebiter<BR>

<br>
Im not defending a "friend" Im stating my opinions on the situation.  <br>
<br>
First of all he's just as much of a friend as about 200 other people I know on this god damn server... he's not a close buddy hell I havent talked to him in over a month.  An "associate" would have been a better choice of words but WTF does that matter!?!?!?<br>
<br>
You said yourself if I remember correctly that someone said there was a loot message when in fact there isnt... correct?  I may be wrong I dont FEEL like re reading this god forsaken thread.<br>
<br>
THE POINT IM TRYING TO MAKE IS... you have no HARD evidence... its NOT a big issue and you're truly over reacting over something that isnt as significant as you'd like to think it is.  <br>
<br>
These are my opinions as your opinions are yours.  Why you decided to make this a flame fest between me in you is beyond me, no matter either way, but I directed nothing towards anyone in perticular other than just stating my thoughts on the situation.  <br>
<br>
All I know is that from my past experiences... (being that I met Goht during raids and raided with him quite often) I see no reason why I would suspect such behavior... and the FACTS are your FACTS could be nothing but meer coincidence.  You know this as much as anyone else does yet you're so certain he did it.<br>
<br>
And as far as him not remembering who it was who ported him up should not be an issue either... I cant remember names of people who did things much more significant for me being that there are SO MANY damn people in the game I come across on a daily basis... so if he was in EC /shouting for a wiz to port him to hate for 150 pp and someone said "hey I'll do it" does that mean he's lying because he cant remember their name??  NO I think not!<br>
<br>
When Duec ninja'd the raid I led a while back there was evidence QUITE similar to this situation leading us to think that a raid member stole the loot... being that there was a near wipe out and only 5 or so stood through in the lair when she dropped and one of which had to leave IMMEDIATLY (just as Goht did) and there was NO REASON why that person wasnt automatically blamed for the ninja looting... all the circumstances gave good cause as to why they would have been blamed... HOWEVER they had NOTHING to do with it and rather than pointing fingers I wanted PROOF before blaming anyone because if I had blamed someone without hard evidence it would have made me just as lame as the person looting.  Atleast thats how I see it.<br>
<br>
<br>
Either way if this argument is now a flame fest between you and I thats fine... Im not arguing on Gohts behalf Im just arguing that until you have PROOF which you NEVER WILL there is no reason to keep trying to make him look like a piece of shit... let him get his reputation based on facts, not opinions.<br>

Pull out your heads, he took it. The people on raid who witnessed events think so, and people who weren't there refuse to believe it. </font><br>
<br>
What I dont understand is how can you "see someone away from the main raid"???  If you can "see them" they are not away... and how can you be so damn certain that one person was not there the entire time... do you have someone doing a /target Goht and every other raid member the entire time of the raid?  No, I think not.  The only way this would have been legitimate was if someone had suspected him to be away taking the book, when in fact it took quite some time before anyone realized it was gone... so how do you know he wasnt there???  <br>
<br>
Here's another point I'd like to make while Im at it... I've done hate enough times to know that during a break in or whatever a "rogue" will quite often do, or help with, the CR... who's to say that during some said corpse run (if there were any) some other rogue wandered off (being that they were already away from camp) and grabbed it?  <br>
<br>
How can you prove that he wasnt at the camp?  Someone can be at the camp and still be out of one person's target range and in anothers... people dont usually stay THAT close together ALL the time.  It is possible that you are mistaken, and you know it.<br>
<br>
As far as him having to leave... Who's to say he didnt have to bail because his parents wanted him off of his comp and it just "happened" to be after the book came up missing?  It is VERY possible.  So you cant say he only left because he stole the book... it is very possible that he REALLY had to go.  Not everyone is living on their own away from mommy and daddy with the freedom to stay on as long as they'd like to.  I've seen people have to bail at the worst moments of a raid because parents got pissed off... it happens.<br>
<br>
A day or so after the actual raid Goht sent me a tell asking if I had heard about the situation... I said "yes"... he then asked if I believed he did it.  My response was "I wasnt there, there's no proof I have no reason to believe it either way."  And there's no reason why you could convince me to believe he should be blamed for the "occurances".  Lay out some proof... some logs of people discussing him away from camp and not being able to find him in the camp... conversation between him and group mates discussing his where-abouts... anything... something more than just your word against his.  <br>
<br>
<font color=yellow>I think some of you are living in a dream world using the 'you have no proof' line as an excuse to keep liking someone. </font><br>
<br>
I have no need to like Goht or be his friend I (even though it sounds conceited) have plenty of friends... so, my friend, I think you're living in a dream world if you think its just an excuse for being liked or having one more friend on someone's friends list.  Goht has never done anything less than shown good team play in game (during raids) and he did in fact need his book after the events that occured.  I was going to help him get it, I told him the easiest way to do it, I told him I'd help if he couldnt get anyone else to, he asked me to come invis him while he ported up... but found someone else instead.  TELL ME HOW THIS WOULDNT LEAD ME TO BELIEVE HE DIDNT TAKE THE BOOK?<br>
<br>
I do know that he was taunted and harassed by people (not naming names) for some time after the event and I never dreamed that over a month later this shit wouldnt have been long blown over.'<br>

<font color=yellow>"Circumstantial? yes it is. So what." -- Toein <br>
So what? its someones rep you tard, you shouldnt trash someones rep without being 100% positive your right. A bad rep can make life very difficult. <br>
"In the end none of its important anymore. Alarah holds her Blade. Goht has ruined his own reputation. " --- Toein<br>
<br>
Goht didnt ruin his rep, Sage and Torm did.<br>
If it isnt important, why the hell did you post, and why the hell are poeple on this crusade against goht? <br>
Sage has yet to show anything more substantial than what Goht has shown. </font><br>
<br>
Toe, I adore ya cuz you rock, but frankly Birren is right.  That post doesnt seem like a personal stab at you, its just a logical response that's going against what story that ToF and other raid members are presenting to the public.  <br>
<br>
There is no reason why these people should be so determined to ruin this guys reputation.  I think trying so hard to make someone out to be a thief is worse than "ninja looting" the book from hate... and Im seeing a lot of others think the same thing.<br>

That's it?  Think about that for a minute, Birren.  Why would a rogue be asking a druid how to get an item for the rogue epic when he already knew where it was?<br>

No, Jex, I never said that.  No one at the raid ever said that there was a loot message.  If someone told that to you later on, it was just a false rumor that didn't come from me.<br>

The evidence is sufficient for just about everyone other than you, tools like Birren, and the CoKs.  If you think that stealing an epic item isn't very significant, you're entitled to your opinion.  Believe it or not, there are people who are a lot more pissed at Goht than I am.<br>

It became a flame fest between you and me when you said that Goht's accusers -- which includes me -- were spreading all sorts of lies.  If you can make yourself look at the situation objectively, I think you'll admit that you shouldn't have said that.<br>

As far as I can recall, we had no CRs on that raid, other than a partial wipeout during the hot portal break in.  We certainly didn't have any CRs during the 10-15 minute gap between the last time one of the pullers saw the book and the time it was discovered to have been stolen.<br>

With all due respect, Jex, you're a sucker.  You like Goht, and you don't want to believe that he did it.  He's been trying to salvage his reputation with you because you run raids, and he's succeeded.  You're buying into the &quot;these are all lies spread by the evil Sagemon and Tormentcia&quot; defense.

There's not a big difference in someone he picked up in EC as to someone who joined his guild for a short period of time... either way the fact that he doesnt have a name means nothing... kinda like the fact that you "think" he stole the book.<br>
<br>

Jex, pay attention. The person who saw Goht away from the main group was one of the pullers. The pullers leave the main group to go pull mobs.

<br>
Ok so at first it was "he wasnt at camp" now its "he was seen away from the camp by the pullers"... funny how such details are worked in later.  Now let me ask this... are there invis mobs in Hate?  And did the puller have see invis which allowed him or her to see him while sneak/hiding throughout the zone?  And where are the screen shots and/or claims from such "pullers"??... so far I see "your" story and others backing up "your" accusations and the way "you" see how everything went down.  <br>

<br>
Flame away Sage all mighty... let your friends come and defend you too... I dont mind at all... my posts and thoughts on the situation have nothing to do with liking or disliking anyone... it has nothing to do with saving his rep (being that its already as fucked as its going to get).  I just really want to know why the hell its so damn important for you and your crew to keep making it worse?  Why was he harassed in game over the issue long after words with statements of "proof" that never surfaced?  Your proof that he did steal the book is as valuable as everyone elses proof that he didnt... as I said before there is none.  The circumstances prove nothing, therefor, your statements and accusations are invalid to those who cant say that they were there to see what really occured.<br>
<br>
And, just for the record, I never said anyone is evil, I never said you were wrong... I never said he DIDNT take the book... I, however, dont believe you have sound evidence proving it one way or another yet you continue to pound and pound as much as you can... even though it will accomplish nothing more than dragging him harder and longer than you need to.  Lay off already, you've accomplished what you needed to... what more must you aquire from this bashing of his already scarred name?  You win... you've gotten enough people to believe he "did" do it that it really doesnt matter... or do you have to make sure he is SO dragged down that he cant even play or have fun at all anymore?<br>
<br>
You seem to be faced with the thought that because you are an almighty raid leader and such a "respected person on emarr" that you have the power to make the facts as you wish them to be... and when you say that "I" am a tool you fail to realize, my friend, it takes one to know one... and in all due respect... I am no more of a tool than you are yourself.<br>
<br>
You, like me, have earned a lot of respect and disrespect from players on the server.  You have your followers and people who like you, you have ones who wouldnt follow you through South Ro if someone paid them.  And I have similar, you're no better than me, Im no better than you.  The people who have respect from you are going to see your claims and assume they are valid, as they probably would mine in such situation.  However, just because people believe your side of the story and agree that the circumstances point out that he "had to have stolen the book" doesnt make the accusations any more valid than they are if they dont.<br>
<br>
Face it Sage, you cant prove anything, you cant prove one way or another what truly happened to that book.  You've done the damage.  You've ruined his reputation among all the raiders that will follow "your" claims and made the others who are unsure what to believe extra cautious when it comes to being grouped or raiding with him.  You've made your point... nothing more can come out of this than long drawn out arguments that will prove nothing in the long run.  Just laugh at Goht, feel proud of yourself, and move on to something else.  I mean, you do (of course) deserve a big pat on the back for being such a great, noble, perfect, person...  So reward yourself and go on with life. <p><font color=yellow>

<br>
Oh, and, if you truly believe its a matter of defending a "friend" let me point out some "facts" to you that will "prove" otherwise...<br>
<br>
1.  I dont know Goht out of game.  I dont know his name, I dont know his email address.  I know nothing of him other than what I've seen/heard in game. <br>
<br>
2.  Jexielia is completely naked (other than her no drop armor) and ready to fade off into never never land as soon as the subscription expires... the friendship or relationship I "have or had" with Goht holds no validity... that is NOT the basis of my argument and defense on his part because it wont ever be a factor of anything I do ever again.  I will never lead another raid so salvaging his reputation will not effect me.  I just think you've gone to far and its time to end the fight because not much more damage can be done.<br>
<br>
3.  I will (more than likely) never have contact with Goht again outside of the discussions on this board... same goes for tons of other "friends" that I had, many of which were far closer to me than him.  So regardless of the relationship status I would feel the same way about this situation if it were someone I didnt know at all.<br>
<br>
Is that to hard to understand?   <p><font color=yellow>

umm well lets see.  Since you had already trashed is name and abvously wouldnt help him, that leaves only a few others that he has met that MIGHT know how to do it.  Had i been in his shoes i might have done the same thing.  Maybe he was thinking about it, saw jex online and decided to ask her.<br>
<br>
Like i said its JUST as CIRCUMSTANTIAL as anything you have against him.  And if YOU would look at this objectively you would see that.  <br>
<br>
I cant find it now, and i dont feel like searching this whole thread for it, but somewhere here i believe Sagemon, you said that we are just coming up with this to go on liking a person.  Or somthing like that.  I am not arguing this because i like goht, or because he is a freind, never once have i stated anything along those lines.  I am here arguing because you are trashing somones rep on shaky at best circumstantial evidence.  <br>
<br>
And Toein, ... nm i wont even open that can up.  Just go away.<br>
<br>
Honestly, if you are all swayed this easily, I have some nice beachfront property in Nevada to sell you.  <br>
<br>
This is my last post on this subject, i am tired of trying to convince someone who refuses to open up their eyes and look &quot;objectively&quot; (as Sagemon put it) at this.  Go to the other thread started about this whole issue and read what Igota said, read it &quot;objectively&quot;.  He has a very good point.  <br>

For those of you who don't know me I am Braydin. Unlike ALL the rest of you I HAVE met Goht in REAL life! He looked me directly in the eye and told me he did NOT take the book. I am sorry but someone/anyone looking me in the eye and telling me something holds more weight than those that hide behind anonymous names and spread rumors. Here are a few EXTRA facts.<br>
 <br>
<br>
1. Goht regularly has ISP problems, his parents want the phone or just want him off, or pick up the line to boot him off. If you knew that you were in the PLANE OF HATE and it was very possible that someone in your house would pick up the phone just to get you off the net. Would you not use any means nessicarry to leave... He asked, no one would take him so he used a potion...damn book or no damn book I would have done the same thing! I would not hang around to be booted off my PC while in hate and risk dying in there when I am finally allowed to log back in.<br>
<br>
2. What are you really accusing him of...doing what rogues do best! If this was an issue then the GM's would have investigated it, and they have log programs that according to them are extremely detailed. I think its possible that they did check and found nothing. They claim to check out all such events.<br>
<br>
3. The book is a ground spawn, how do you know that another rogue didn't get a port up before or after your raid did. I saw a ton of rogues at the general raid that had already done that part of the quest. Lets just ask each and every rogue that has attained that has completed the steamfont part of the quest to PROVE where THEY got THEIR book. <br>

4. Someone earlier said that wanting proff beyond a shoadow of a doubt was pointless and I believe the word was childish!! The court systems in most civilized countries use a similar or exactly those rules! So they are childish? Boy I hope in RL you never get accused of something you didn't do! <br>

5. Alot of people are mad at goht? Hell most of them at fan faire had never even HEARD of goht, these are people from large high level guilds. For so many people that are pissed about this, it seems most of them are ToF members. I think they are ruining their rep with the continued flaming, and  I KNOW that Goht has recently recieved help from one of the MOST respected guilds on the server.  DROP IT!<br>

I will happily recruit the help of friends to aid me in getting what I want. I have no tolerance for people getting in my way, and I am completely relentless until any threats or opposition are removed. I try to be down-to-earth, but something always seems to get in the way. <A HREF="http://blog.ravenblack.net/quiz/videogame.pl">What Video Game Character Are You?</A>

Yeah... how do you know?  >:)<br>

On 2 of the hate raids I have done I have had rogues port up and ask if they could grab the book... who's to say anyone would have noticed if they didnt ask.  *shrug* <p><font color=yellow>
