I went to the video store. I rented &quot;The Sum of all Fears.&quot; Some of you may have read the novel it is based upon. Excellent novel.  Then I put the movie into my VCR(all the DVDs were out), hit play, and sat back.  First of all, let me say I am a Clancy junky. I've read all his books. If you've read his books, you'll acknowledge he is very consistent, and has a certain style to his books and characters. While watching this movie, a few things popped up.<br>
<br>
#1 Ben Affleck is ok as Jack Ryan. Not Great. But acceptable.<br>
<br>
#2 The guy who plays the president, only plays presidents. He is like the Jon Lovitz of political thrillers. He can play one role and only one role.<br>
<br>
#3 This is very important. Have you ever read a book, and loved it. There is one character you really enjoy, and you picture him or her a certain way. That character for me is Clark in the Clancy books. He is a hardass former seal who is so good at covert ops he's still doing it in his 40s. He also has a real mean streak(read Without Remorse) and is an overall sunuvabitch. So who have they chosen to play him? In this movie, it's some wussy guy who looks like he belongs in a steven baldwin movie. Really really terrible. He's also been played by Willem Defoe(Who, if you've seen boondock saints, should never, ever, ever be allowed to play a hardass of any sort). Imagine Frodo as Michael Clark Duncan and you get the type of miscasting I'm talking about.<br>
<br>
#4 Lets take a great book, that sold millions of copies, change the storyline to some rediculous Bond type scenario, change everything in the plot that made it compelling, and spend 100 million dollars making a movie. The lord of the rings movies are good. Why? They're true to the books. So why can't people in hollywood get the fact that people liked the book, and they'll like the movie. Movies are simply books for people who are too lazy to read. Nazis? The Superbowl in Washington? Oh good, now he's stuck in his truck with fire all around him. Horrible changes that completely ruined this movie for me. <br>
<br>
<br>
That said, the movie had some redeeming qualities. Explosions. The hot woman playing the future Mrs. Ryan. Did I mention the explosions? And......<br>
<br>
<br>
Well that's it. <br>
<br>
Anyone else had an experience with a book turned to film that absolutely and completely ruined your day? I think I'll be irritated about this for weeks. Why do they change it?!?!? Why Why Why! That's why I'm asking you to write your congressman. If enough of us write we can stop these problems. Just create one big bill. It will have campaign finance reform, the assassination of all movie people who change great novels into terrible movies, a nationwide education lottery, high-speed internet connections everywhere in the country, and the end of Soccer, thereby making room for NFL2, so we can have year round football. Imagine the worldcup if they were playing a real game instead of.... bleh.... soccer. I watch the world cup mind you, but only for the fans. Imagine crazy brazilians shooting the referee after he misses a crucial pass interferance penalty? Or those irritating guys who always take dives getting tackled by Ray Lewis. I'd like to see Totti pop up after he gets his penalty kick when Ray picks him up and pile drives him. Does anyone really doubt that if America's premier athletes played soccer we wouldn't be the best? I don't see Spaniards and Frenchmen beating Randy Moss or T-Mac to a header. Or Brian Urlacher slide tackling you. Or how about Kevin Garnett as a goalie. Lets see, a 7 footer who is as fast as anyone else on the field, has a huge wingspan, is rediculously athletic, and has hands the size of the wheels on a small import would probably make a pretty good goalie. But they don't. Why? Because they play real sports, not soccer, where you only get to use half your appendages. Am I the only one who sees the merits of this?<br>
<br>
Gilg<br>
<br>
<br>
PS: Not disparaging soccer(ok I am) but the reason it is the most popular sport in the world is not how good the game is. It's because it's easy. Anyone can play. All you need is a ball. Parents don't see it as a way their children could get killed. In short, no game combines the skill, complexity, ebb and flow, sheer athleticism of all sorts, chess match type game play, and sheer unadulterated violence like football. Soccer pales in comparison.<br>
<br>
PPS: I will not call soccer football, or futbol, or anything but soccer. That makes it sound too much like actual football, which football might take as a slight toward itself, which I'd never want to do.<br>

Being an American I've always hated the idea of our 'football'.<br>
Ok, hate is a bit strong - I did play it a few years in high school, but I think that even further soured my impression.<br>
<br>
Ok, let's start a game.  Get the biggest mutants to grace the earth - these folks aren't necessarily that fast or that graceful or even that coordinated... but at the minimum they can hold up their arms and hold other mutants at bay.<br>
<br>
We'll get the 5 tons of human flesh and line them up on a field.. and have them move an average 10 yards every 20 minutes (or likely longer) with the extreme exception of 10+ yards... anything longer and the crowd goes wild - obviously because the game is so boring otherwise that anyone that can carry a ball (well, that's what they call it) for more than 10 yards is a god.<br>
<br>
After struggling back and forth over a 10 yard patch of grass for a few downs you then must retire to the bench and watch another similar crowd of men from your own team go out and play for a series of downs.  Obviously possessing the skills for both offense and defense is a rare commodity - you know that holding your hands up is quite taxing and should only be done by trained professionals and when done for periods longer than 20 minutes will over tax the (mental) system of even the greatest &quot;football&quot; god.<br>
<br>
I have to give you one thing.<br>
Football is quite chess-like <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>in it's complete lack of action.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->  Back-forth, 1, back-forth, 2, back-forth, 3... better kick.  Repeat ad nauseum.<br>

Brilliant!<br>
<br>
But I must say this.  American football is almost as much more exciting to watch than baseball than basketball is to American football.<br>
<br>
Baseball == boring (except for the rare homer that you wait hours to see -- hours spent watching people kick dirt and spit).<br>
<br>
Football == brainless (but sometimes you see someone with balls of rock do something spectacular that lasts a precious short seconds; if you're REALLY lucky, it'll be a quick serious of spectacular things coordinated between teammates)<br>
<br>
Basketball == hard athletic work<br>
<br>
I think of Hockey much like basketball.  Fast pace, with a technique to it.  Bonus points for doing it on ice skates.<br>
<br>
And same category for soccer.  I've never seen teams of people work so hard to accomplish so ostensibly little.<br>
<br>
I just happen to like hard work, tho.  I find it exciting and thrilling to watch.<br>

<br>
#1 The running man was absolutely horrible, Chuk is correct.<br>
<br>
#2 Soccer is not a bad sport, it's simply not the sport for me. Comparing it to football goes something like this. <br>
<br>
Soccer: 11 men to a team, plus about 2 relevant substitutions. At any point approximately half the people on the field are involved, the other half are on the other side of the field waiting. If a team gets a two goal lead, it becomes a game of keep away, in which you essentially get to see them hunker down on slightly over half the field and kick the ball the other way every time it gets near their goal. While the players are obviously in excellent physical condition, they're game focuses more on speed, stamina, and footwork. This is also a sport that is easy to understand, and at the highest level essentially breaks to to A) an endless stream of crosses that your big white guy attempts to head in(see Germany) or B) an attempt to lead your little fast guy past the defenders while avoiding the offside penalty, whereby he can outrun the defender with the ball and attempt to shoot the ball past the goalie(during which they seemingly miss the entire goal some time trying to put one strange spin on the ball or another. Tactically there is some strategy involved, but nowhere near the level that is neccessary in other sports(hockey, basketball, FOOTBALL).<br>
<br>
Football: You essentially have three teams per team. The offense, which consists of 20 or so players. The defense, which consists of 25 or so players, and the special teams, which draws from both other teams and has a few specialists. One player cannot dominate a football game. Football is a more specialized game. The linemen's primary attributes are strength, agility, and technique. The quarterback needs a good head on his shoulders, arm strength, amazing peripheral vision, split second decisionmaking skills, an amazing amount of football knowledge, good footwork, leadership, and a strong grasp of what the offense is overall trying to do. The recievers need good hands, speed, jumping ability, quick reflexes, etc etc. How many soccer players could play professional football? How many football players could play professional soccer(don't give me this they'd get tired crap, a defensive back wouldn't have to change his training much to be able to run all day on a soccer pitch). They're different. If you enjoy a continuous monotony with occasional flashes of brilliance, soccer might be for you. I choose football. There's a break after every play. There has to be, because if there wasn't the game wouldn't be able to be played with the explosiveness it has now. Football is a game you have to understand to appreciate, like hockey. If you don't know what's going on, you won't appreciate a good block, or an adept play action pass, or any of the other small things that make football the best damn sport in the world. Take the best soccer player in the world, and he'd be a Wayne Chrebet in the NFL. &quot;Oh he's small, but he's quick, and he's got lots of heart. He makes it in this league on will alone.&quot; Sure they can run all day, but can they go across the middle? Can they pick up a blitzer? Can they tackle Jerome Bettis? Do they have the brainpower to know an NFL playbook, audible at the line, and get their team in the correct play. You can say what you want about football, or say I'm just upset because America sucks at soccer. The simple fact of the matter is this: America produces the best athletes. Swimming, track and field, basketball, and soon enough soccer. The world has noticed we're improving. Some of our kids are actually playing soccer now. As I said before, imagine if Randy Moss was a forward, or Kevin Garnett a goalie. If you think I'm crazy just say so, but I'll take just about any of the elite players in the NFL and put them up against any soccer player and we'll see who is stronger, faster, more agile, more explosive, and just about any other physical attribute you want to compare. I'd wager noone in the world cup could hang with Randy Moss or Deuce McAllister in a sprint. You gonna tell me Olivier Kahn is stronger than Jevon Kearse? Want to tell me those fullbacks in soccer can outjump or outpower a guy like Danny Fortson to a header? I saw Danny Fortson touch the top of the backboard in person in college. No. Our best athletes simply don't play soccer. Once they do, we'll be one of the best at that too. Soccer is ok, I love the world cup. But give me a cold winter afternoon, cheering with 108,000 of my closest friends at the Coliseum, watching the most talented athletes in the world do what they do best, and I'll take it over the world cup any day <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
Love the patriotism.  Athletically, we do indeed rock.<br>
<br>
Just that in my (not so?) humble opinion, I've seen us shine in far more gloriously focused things than American football.<br>
<br>
Track and field.  There's an area we do well in with a lot of heart.<br>
<br>
Honestly, you wanna know the biggest single reason I dislike football versus soccer?  The on-field intra-team domination aspect.<br>
<br>
You take basketball (and soccer too for that matter).  Sure, you may have a bright shining star, but the rest of the team works hard too.  It's just more even of a thing from a team perspective.<br>
<br>
In football, you have this leader/soldier thing.  Just like your breakdown of the leadership necessities of a quarterback.  I'm not saying that an offense line is all about the ball-handlers.  But the ball-handlers have to, by nature of the sport, exert a leadership dominance over the rest of the squad.<br>
<br>
Times three squads!  Offense, Defense, etc.<br>
<br>
Too much like armies.  Slow, convoluted, tactical certainly, but still, lots of intra-team dominance.<br>
<br>
Basketball, hockey, soccer each have their tactics, their formulas for team synergy, but the pace is faster therefore the team synergy is different.  You don't have time to huddle, pep talk, shout, and break for the next play.  You've got to work together the whole time, or you screw up.<br>

Football is about running for 45 minutes non-stop and still having the ability, speed, stamina and strength to put on a very fast sprint. You're best American Football players are at the peak of physical fitness but it would take a great deal to go from 8 minutes with breaks to two 45 minute non stop halves. <br>
<br>
I'd quote the rest of your post but it was rubbish and it made my eyes hurt. The chances are you've seen some very mundane football in your time but that's to be expected unless you've watched a wealth of international games. If you can try and catch some of the Serie A Italian league and if you don't turn off your TV wnderig just how someone could make a ball do that with just their feet I'll be surprised.<br>
<br>
I've seen a lot of mundane football also and sometimes it looks really &quot;unskilled&quot; like martial arts does if your used to corregraphed fights in films. But I've also played against some of the top under-21 teams in my time and they really excel. <br>
<br>
You call American Football explosive action but a great deal of people see it as &quot;stop-start&quot; and very boring. Just when something looks to get interesting it ends. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/bemarr.showUserPublicProfile?gid=oumadar>Oumadar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 87<br> <font color=#E9D756>(11/1/02 4:10 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3768.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Yeah right....whatever!</span><hr size=1> Soccer &gt; Football. <br>

I remain convinced that soccer is the world's premier sport only because of it's ease of use and the fact that it is historically popular in the bulk of the world. Add to the fact that to play football you almost have to be 5'10&quot; and be able to take a hit and that takes out a large portion of the people in the world. People who are too intimidated to play football play soccer. I know that from high school. If you went out for football, couldn't put up with the hitting, then you went and played soccer, where practice was essentially running cross country and ball skills. Sure it takes talent to kick the ball around, but why limit yourself? Why restrict yourself to just your feet when you have these cool arms you can do stuff with?  And just because someone isn't fast and have good stamina doesn't mean they're not physically fit. Look at Tony Boselli or Jonathan Ogden, these people are in very good physical shape, they just happen to be 6'8&quot; 300+ and are the elite linemen in football. In a mile race would the soccer players win? Perhaps. In a 40 yard dash? No chance. Depends on what you enjoy. I'd much rather see a game that requires strategy on the coaching level, explosive bursts of actions, multiple mini-games on each play, and the use of all our appendages. If you refuse to acknowledge that because you're a little guy and the big football players scared you in high school, or you prefer running endlessly to an intricate game where simply being physically superior is not enough to pull through, that's your decision. As to what level of soccer I have watched, I saw probably 20+ matches during the world cup. I am a sports junkie. I watch all sports. I probably know soccer's rules just as well as you do, even though I'm not an officianado of the game. Hell I'd watch water polo if there wasn't anything else on, any sport is better than 90% of the other crap on TV. /shrug, no point in arguing further, but you will never convince me that aside from their physical stamina soccer players have anything going for them over other professional athletes. And football players don't train to run for two hours, they train to be as explosive as possible during each play. I hope some of our best athletes start to play soccer just to prove my point.<br>

PS: Yeah I was terrible at sports. So terrible my ankles no longer work from playing hours of pick up football and basketball as well as organized leagues, along with being a catcher for 9 years. I did try soccer for one season. It was ok, being goalie was fun every once in a while, but I knew where my love was as far as sports went. I know I'm not going to change your mind, but watch a football or basketball game and pay attention to what these players do. Then ask yourself could a soccer player do that? :P<br>

PPS: The only former rugby player in the NFL I know of is Darren Bennett, know what he does? He's a PUNTER. A good one, and he does tackle occasionally, but stilll... a punter. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/bemarr.showUserPublicProfile?gid=arnwolfmagnuson>Arnwolf Magnuson</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 494<br> <font color=#E9D756>(11/2/02 12:13 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3768.topic&index=20>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Yeah right....whatever!</span><hr size=1>  <br>

I see I am going to have to settle this...When it comes to professional play (not talking intramural, high school, college or any of that crap)...purely professional:<br>
<br>
Football is by far the best sport from the consumer fans point of view. Well timed breaks, pace that coincides well with needed commercialization and that all important atmosphere of heroism about it. The average person cannot identify with a pro football player...and they like it that much more because of it.<br>
<br>
Soccer is the best in terms of understanding and appreciation by the common man. It doesn't take a physical goliath to play and enjoy soccer. The everyday man can identify with and support the pro players on a level that few other sports allow. This breeds fierce competition and fan loyalty because of the sheer number of teams capable of competing in the same class. <br>
<br>
Sure, you can try to compare the two...but their appeal, strong points and weak points are all completely at odds with one another, making any such comparison patently mute. <br>
