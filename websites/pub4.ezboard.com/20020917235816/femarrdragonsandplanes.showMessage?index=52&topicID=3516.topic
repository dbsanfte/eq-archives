<br>
And the difference between that and getting a monster stuck somewhere so it can't hit you is..... none, it's an exploit too.  HOWEVER the question still remains unanswered.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> How can you be so certain he was exploiting back then??</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> There are many legitimate ways to accomplish seemingly outlandish things if you are willing to think outside the box (and thinking outside the box doesn't mean getting a monster stuck somewhere it can't hit you, or <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> putting yourself in a place where the monster cant see you</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->).<br>
<br>
Is having a necro in your XP group as the main healer and the group surviving quite well (no deaths) and taking out named mobs an exploit... no, it's just thinking outside the box.  It's down to learning about the powers we're given and how they interact with other classes and the environment.<br>
<br>
Is being able to produce a damageshield that totals over 100 per hit, thus making it worth not slowing monsters so they beat themselves to death, an exploit?  No, it's because I tested it withing VI's rules and without cheating anything can produce such a damage shield.  <br>
<br>
<br>
Let me ask a few questions of you Chiteng...<br>
<br>
Where do you stand on the matter of intentional / maliceous (sp?) training with the purpose of getting other players killed?<br>
<br>
How do you feel about trade scammers and exploiters of trade / item / money bugs??<br>
<br>
What are your views on players that harass other players and make inappropriate comments (sexual or otherwise)??<br>
<br>
Do you have any opinions about Ninja looters??<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> &quot;Ask him if any obnoxious monk has ever given his guild a hard time.&quot;</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Are you saying that you, Chiteng, are an obnoxious monk?<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> &quot;I cant tell you how many times when on a guild raid, we would run into some ass, and the group would collectively sigh in pain, knowing what was to come.&quot;</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Your group know what is coming, they let out a collective sigh in pain.  Doesn't that tell you anything?<br>

Look at Glorianna, She is erudite, she is well read, she is able to make cohesive<br>
and sound arguments. But when she does, she is mostly not ignored exactly,<br>
more like, not commented on. But when she simply vamps or flames, people are<br>
all over her.<br>
<br>
She is no fan of mine and me no fan of hers. I site her soley for example.<br>
<br>
What does it say about this board that you will get better reviews vamping,<br>
than you will with an essay?<br>
<br>
I pander to the audience, and being obnoxious is the lowest common denominator.<br>
If everyone here were as well mannered as Bill Buckley I think I would be quite different.<br>
<br>
Also I told you, I have NOT heard player 'S' side of the story. Nor do I think it<br>
likely I will. But I can tell you that he was casting, and not one mob attacked him.<br>
Why? because I was there, because I saw it. Because I asked him how he did it and got no answer. He was casting destructive spells, not prots. But I suspect<br>
that those familiar with Unrest, can tell you exactly how he did it. I was just<br>
an ignorant level 22 monk.<br>

That is all they did. NOT ONCE did they forbid it. Yes I did ask. I asked Uini(sp?)<br>

Not exactly permission, but sure as hell not prohibition. <br>

<br>
If being obnoxious is the ONLY way that YOU can get peoples attention then you have a problem.  Unfortunately you chose to be abnoxious and have continued to be so for the past 3 years, this I think it is fair to say has made the majority of people who read your posts somewhat jaded to the point that if you now attempted to change your ways no one would trust or believe you.. in a similar way to the boy who cried wolf.<br>
<br>
There are other ways to get peoples attention here, but that is no longer an option for you.<br>
<br>
<br>
Please feel free to mull over the other points and questions I raised, if you decide you don't want to answer or comment specificly to them would you mind just letting me know that so I can make draw information and my own conclusions from your other posts and evaluate accordingly.<br>
<br>

Look, I dont know what your game is. You come out of nowhere, I dont know you<br>
from Adam. I am sorry the enviorment on this message board is NOT conducive<br>
to normal conversation. After three years I have become geared to one mode.<br>
<br>
I am sorry if that offends you or if it gets in the way of your data collection.<br>
I dont have the luxury of your detachment. You dont tell me what you angle is and you expect complete and honest cooperation. <br>
<br>
Did you happen to notice Feldynn that I was just a little bit busy?<br>
I even learned to spell your name JUST because you have been civil.<br>
Civility is sorely lacking on this board.<br>
<br>
Now I have told the truth as I see it. I dont care if every poster on this board<br>
shouted me down. The TRUTH is NOT a hostage of their belief or their acceptance.<br>
<br>
Every time they try, they simply harden my resolve. Ogmuk gave the best advice<br>
anyone could possibly give in dealing with me. He said - 'DONT ANSWER HIM'<br>

<br>
My posting goes in surges, I am not infinately creative and at times it deterioates.<br>
All I want is the cheaters exposed. I want people to know what kind of people<br>
they are lauding. Abusive players also. I pattern myself after Sulla if you know who that is. But he had a better time than I have. <br>
<br>
If you would explain all the bizzare questions I just might be a bit more open.<br>
Then again maybe not.<br>
