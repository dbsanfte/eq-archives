First, people won't forget about it.  The reputation of DG for pulling stunts like this one is well-known in game and on the board.  Folks don't forget it when a particular group makes it Standard Operating Procedure to screw over anyone that gets in their way.  Shoot, years after they were long gone, people still comment on Mistywolf and Pidnus and Gheywind, etc.<br>
<br>
Second, although you are probably right that DG folks &quot;dont give a fvck&quot;, that's exactly the problem that Tudil and others are raising.  Too many players don't take the enjoyment of others into consideration when they go and pull crap like this.  That kind of behavior is anti-social and contrary to a cooperative game like EQ.  If you wanna operate free of social norms, enjoy ShadowBane or other PK games, or set up a server and enjoy NWN or DiabloII or some other game where you can create your very own sandbox to shyt in.<br>
<br>
It's not &quot;only a game.&quot; It's not CG pixels generated by AI.  It's real people interacting within a game.

Despite Tudil's conclusion, most of the folks in this thread have concluded that Kamoka's action got Tudil killed. It appears that Tudil was meant &quot;directly killed.&quot; And the pulling and then ducking sure sounds like an effort to train someone. Sure sounds like my run down of events fit the facts better than yours or Parum's.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
According to Tudil himself Tudil died by his own fault on his own pull when his own pop added, before he accuses Kamoka of moving a muscle. He does also state that he doesn't think he would have died if Kamoka had not arrived, but he's also careful to state that it's beside the point, and I agree with him. In general I don't think I'd blame somebody for my death, even indirectly, if his crime consisted of sending me a tell - if Tudil really did die because Kamoka wandering by and sending him a tell flustered him, even then I don't find Kamoka to be rude/bad/whatever. Raedwulf however states repeatedly that Kamoka is resposnibe for Tudil's death. It seems that his definition of &quot;most of the folks in this thread&quot; is himself stating it multiple times, because I don't see Tudil or anybody else trying to blame Kamoka for this. And where is this nonsense about &quot;pulling and then ducking&quot; even coming from? I can't see anywhere where any training of the sort is implied, except from Raedwulf, and I don't know what you mean by ducking. Sure sounds like Tudil's run down of events fits the facts much better than Raedwulf's.<br>

<br>
Kamoka stated that Tudil turned down the rez stating that a Paly rez was not good enough for him, then Tudil countered that he turned it down because Kamoka said 10k. One is true, one is not, I inserted nothing. I can't know for sure who to believe, I wasn't there. You are right, Kamoka has not bothered to post a second rebuttal to the new 10k accusation, but the statement that he did make strongly contradicts the accusation already.<br>

However, I have read dozens of threads about y'all pulling shyt like this, so it sure seems like the stereotype is alive and well without me.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I interpreted the statement &quot;Thank you for reinforcing the stereotype of DG.&quot; along with the post that it ended as a flame against DG, and therefore I qualify the person who made it as being a &quot;anti-DG flamer&quot;, at least for the moment that he/she wrote it. Simple enough?<br>

<br>
If one believes Kamoka's version, then all he got was grief for his attempts to share the unused mobs of a camp and help a stranger who died on his own with a rez. Grief like a flame against him on the emarr board, perhaps you did &quot;see&quot; that?<br>

<br>
Yes, Raedwulf's version of the events is quite damning, but to me that version simply does not seem supported by the statements here at all.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Why is everyone biased? I reject that assumption.

<br>
Well, sounds like a philosophy debate. I believe the school that assumes any rational human's life experience necesetate that he/she be biased to believe certain things, so nobody is TRULY unbiased. I admit I'm taking the word &quot;biased&quot; to a high degree here: we typically call a judge or jury &quot;unbiased&quot; so yes by common usage I'm wrong, but I meant that everybody who is alive must have biases so that it is always inaccurate to some degree.<br>
<br>
Incedently, Raedwulf, the statements that you make here about DG do indicate that you are clearly biased against DG. But I don't know you, maybe you really are just an unbiased robot or something. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/bemarr.showUserPublicProfile?gid=coroq>Coroq</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 264<br> <font color=#E9D756>(10/29/02 6:50:12 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3762.topic&index=48>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> feh</span><hr size=1> Hmm, well, after all that, I guess the real joke is on me.

1) Noone got pushed out of a camp. 2) Once again, by his own admission he didn't die due to anyone else but himself. 3) Taunting about a rez seems to be an 'after-thought' rant and completly uncomfirmed. 4) How do you know the death went unrezzed?<br>
So many incorrect assertions in 1 sentence - it must be a record.<br>
<br>
And my point about rudeness; coming to R&amp;F to complain to some of the rudest people ever to grace EMarr (many of whom no longer play) seems ironic. We start by someone complaining about perceived 'rude' behaviour - to people who then respond by calling people ass-clowns (whatever that might be) and various other vulgarities. Having said that, I think I've stated my opinions clearly and had my brief incursion into R&amp;F for the year. Have fun...<br>

<br>
Coroq:  Well, aside from DG members, the only other person to comment upon Kamoka's actions was Araya.  He condemned, them too.  While my &quot;everyone else&quot; may have been a bit overboard due to all the non-substantive discussions on anon-flamers and sentence structure, the point remains that only you guildies have backed him up.<br>
<br>
&quot;Pulling and ducking&quot; referred to pulling from the camp over to Tudil's monk, and then not engaging it.  I was typing in a rush.  Yes, Kamoka said that Tudil rejected the Pally rez, but he never said it was free or denied that it was offered at 10K.  Your &quot;one is true, one is not&quot; is inaccurate.  Both statements can be true.  Tudil may have rejected the Pally rez at 10K.  Both true.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Yes, your conclusion regarding &quot;anti-DG flamer&quot; was simple enough.  Totally baseless, but simple.  One flame wherein I mention having read numerous DG flames (most of which were about exactly this type of self-centered conduct) is hardly sufficient basis to provide a label.  Whatever.<br>
<br>
Go ahead and reject my restatement of Tudil's complaint.  That's your perogative.  But, it's that type of ignoring the impressions of others that is so prevalent in this thread from y'all.<br>
<br>
And I never said that anyone was a perfect foil (unbiased) on all issues.  However, in this discussion, I think it is possible.  Not everyone will have a pre-conceived opinion of either Tudil or DG, so it is perfectly reasonable to expect an unbiased observer.  But, if it makes you more comfortable to label anyone that says something negative about DG or a guildie as biased and anti-DG, welcome to Paranoia-ville.  <br>
<br>
And my conclusion that Kamoka was in the wrong here and in keeping with other flames I've seen directed against y'all, doesn't demonstrate a bias.  Sure, I think you're a bunch of wankers now, but not beforehand.<br>
<br>
And for dissing me for making assumptions, the number of them in your post is rather amusing.  &quot;flustered&quot;, &quot;free rez&quot;, &quot;anti-DG&quot;.<br>
<br>
Putian:  I don't believe hardly any of the rants and flames on this board.  However, numbers and consistency tend toward painting a pretty accurate picture over time.<br>
<br>
Sakkath:  So if you make a bad pull, you waive your right to the camp?  That's pretty lame.  And it's not consistent with what I've gleaned from the game and the board over the past 3 years.  Whatever.  We'll see what happens next time you get wiped out and some other guild comes along behind and pushes you out of their way.<br>
<br>
The taunting was unconfirmed?  So was Kamoka's allegedly free offer.  So is the whole story.  So what?  <p>-- The Bastard formerly known as Raedwulf</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/bemarr.showUserPublicProfile?gid=sakkathdeath1>sakkathdeath1</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 225<br> <font color=#E9D756>(10/30/02 3:12:54 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3762.topic&index=53>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: .</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Sakkath: So if you make a bad pull, you waive your right to the camp?

Complain to VI not me about policies regarding camps. Regardless, noone lost their camp in this situation, and I agree it would be pretty tasteless (whether or not it's against 'the rules') if they had. This being the case, your continued posting, and the whole 'rant' itself seems rather moribund.<br>

<br>
In short, don't tell someone who knew DG for 3+years (and was a former member for a short time before leaving due to the nature of the guild and it's lack of concern for other players), what the guild was like. <br>
<br>
DG was and always will be a piss-poor conglomeration of people that could never amount to anything in a good guild. The good people left a long time ago, most throwing their hands up in frustration over trying to straighten the guild out and make it worthwhile. What's left is the dregs of most of the guilds on the server for the most part.<br>

He gave me an fbss and 2 trance stix when i came over, along with a jarsath scale bp. To me that doesnt seem like a guild that would be disgraceful, but then again i am new to the server and dont know the reputation so much of the guilds. However, knowing a reputation of a guild should not play a huge role here, since as we can see some members of a guild can be good people minded players, and others may not be, or change. <br>
  In any event, it appears to me that Kamoka was in the wrong for pulling without receiving a reply from tudil stating that he/she can take it (sorry if i didnt spell your name right=(,dont want to have to wait to refresh browser), even if you see it has helping them since your uber and can tank the mob for them.  This kinda pulling can cause many problems for the player camping as far as interfering with camp strategics, i.e. timing spawns. Whether or not a rez was offered does not matter since you werent killed by being trained or them disrupting camp...at least its not written that way. So cutting it short(or shorter i should say) the only wrong i see here is * disrupting a camp.<br>
<br>
  Now, to me it sounds like no harm was intended and that this rants/flame should not have been posted. Is something that the individuals involved in DG did that cost you game time/loss of exp/loss of item/harrassment? I dont see any of the above. If we were to post for every case something like this happens there would be no point in even having a rants/flames section. However, if it really  effected you that much to flame them, it is your right, but think of what kinda person people are going to think you are if you post every time something happens that doesnt involve /loss of exp/loss of item/harrassment/kill stealing, etc.?<br>
<br>
  If this were to go to a gm...nothing of course would happen. They would have you share the camp anyway, as I am sure you all know. Well, just my 2 cp.<br>
