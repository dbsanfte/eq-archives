I’m a bit over emotional.<br>
<br>
1.) I’m on my 2nd 6 months back on line since my 1 month break, would have to look at my credit card statements to see exactly when I came back. I sent tells for months before I outright asked you to give me the cloak back as the statement of “I’m holding out for a CotfS” really bothered me. Was a huge slap in my face. I took it as yea I know you need the cloak more then I do and I know I could of gotten better but screw you.<br>
<br>
2.) Finding out from someone else that you had in fact got a CotfS and kept acting to me like you were still wearing the SBC was another huge slap in the face. I was in a group with one of your guild mates (who asked me to keep them out of this). I stated UI needed to go kill the statue and get you a CotfS so I could have my SBC back, at which point they said “He has had a CotfS for some time now”. My response was “No, he doesn’t”. I was then told by them “I’m sure he got one”. My response was “I can’t believe that Ted would fuck me like that”. To which they replied “Just go up and inspect him, you will see”. As you’re normally off hunting in places that I can not get to, I didn’t get a chance to inspect you for a few weeks. I also didn’t log on for a week as I was a bit miffed about the thought that you were in fact screwing me with no lube. I heard from another of your guild mates today that you had the CotfS for 3 months now, just to pour more salt in my wounds. <br>
<br>
3.) I truly am sorry for walking up and inspecting you. Anyone that knows me knows I hate that type of action. I was hearing two different stories and had to find out the only way I could. Part of me is glad I was told about this, but to be honest I mostly wish I didn’t know. I would rather feel the slapped in the face from holding out for a godly item as opposed to the bent over backwards and done dry, by someone I thought was a friend feeling I have now.<br>
<br>
4.) No, you would not take the cloak when I tried to just hand it to you; we talked for a bit about it first. It wasn’t until I said “Take the cloak until you get something better” that you finally did take it. I made the obviously poor assumption that “until you get better” meant that I would get it back, or I would of said take it then give it to someone else.  Guess that is my fault for not getting a contract written in blood but then I thought I was dealing with a friend and didn’t need such a thing.<br>
<br>
5.) Don’t give me crap about not seeing tells, I play a monk with an epic and I damn well see purple spam go up my screen between kicks / epic hits. I simply send a quick /r fight spam back but that is just me I guess. My feelings are you didn’t give a shit I was sending you a tell.<br>
<br>
6.) As for me only seeming to talk to you about the cloak. Have I not asked you how you are doing often? Did I not ask you how your leg was when you got hurt? Did I not make sure not to even bring up the cloak when your leg was bad? Have I not asked you how your blood poisoning has been doing? Have I not asked you how Bowling with your parents went? Guess the only thing you want to read from me is “Did you get a better cloak yet Ted?” Questions like the others only matter when they are coming from friends. The last question only matters when it isn’t, as if it was a true friend they would not have to ask.<br>
<br>
7.) As for me taking 1 month off (not 6 or <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  why does that matter? I just don’t get it.<br>
<br>
8.) Your response when I finally did ask for the cloak back of  “I’ve had it to long”. I don’t even know how to answer that one…. I said take it until you get better not my fault I had to find out from others you had better for 3 months. I’m just still baffled by that one sorry.<br>
<br>
9.) One of the times I talked to you about returning the cloak, you answered with “I’ll think about it”. You didn’t say No, Yes, or piss off but “I’ll think about it”. How long was I supposed to give you to think about it Ted? I can see one reason you would say that. When you used to bug me daily about the cloak, I would say “I don’t know” and “I’ll think about it”. I got a tell from Meg one day telling me that it was driving you nuts, that is why you got the cloak. I felt that I had tortured you by not saying “no, this is the one item I will not part with”. I tried to give it to you. You would not take it until I told you to take it until you got better. I think you have just been torturing me as pay back for months about it. Sue me for being too nice to say “No, sorry Ted this is the one thing I won’t give up” and sue me twice for feeling so bad about it I gave it to you to use. Better yet, just screw me out of the cloak.<br>
<br>
10.) No I haven’t used the word I lent it you, loan was never a word used. The words used were “take it until you get better” to me that means loaned until you get a chance to up your gear as my “twinks” had better gear you then you did at that time. My how times have changed.<br>
<br>
11.) You play no twinks you said, funny you grouped with me with your wizard twink that coned red to me and also had his epic and mana robe not that long ago doing imps. We grouped you only because you were a friend of ours as we were there for exp and you know I never tell friends or those I think are my friends that they can not group with me when there is open spots. And yes, I laid in hard about the cloak while we were grouped. Seeing your twinks geared with 10x better then I could ever get, pissed me off probably to the extend you felt back when my monk was a low level. If that wizzy you were playing wasn’t your twink it is my bad when you say this is Tedorn on my wizard as taking it that meant your twink.<br>
<br>
12.) I’ve taken you off my friends list today as I don’t think you really want to hear from me and me seeing you on a /who all friends will just continue to bumm me out and piss me off. I won’t be sending you anymore tells nor Meg as I’m sure she is on your side and pissed off at me as well now, actually she hasn’t sent me a hello in some time. I forgot she tends to play you often so more then likely got some of my tells talking about the now lost to me cloak. Either of you is free to send me a tell to say hello or, if you want to do something. I do miss the groups we had in the old days before this mess, but I highly doubt any of us will feel the way we did back then again. I feel both sides to this affair feel they got a raw a deal. I hope your end of the raw deal worked out better for you then my end did.<br>
<br>
13.) In closing I’ve said my peace, I got a very large burden off my chest that was really eating me to the point I did not want to play anymore. I was really starting to hate anyone I did not know and I doubt I will trust those that have not proven themselves to me time and again for quite a while, if ever in my EQ days. I’m now out the best item I ever had and ever worse lost 2 friends that I thought I had more then likely over this. Take care all and may your EQ days be brighter then mine have for the last few months.<br>
<br>
14.) O just read Meg’s post so going to respond with two things quick. 1, I was quitting the monk and warrior as I had 1 haste item I flip flopped between them, was dead sick of hearing “you are driving Ted nuts” and getting constant tells about the cloak so quit 2 chars so Ted could have the cloak I was getting so sick of hearing about. 2. Ted refused the cloak until I stated he could have it until he got better, was that just candy coating or did he mean it? Personally I think it was the only way he could rationalize taking such a nice item free and clear and not feel bad about it. I know Ted has a good heart, and I know we both feel screwed by this whole affair and Ted is more then likely as much eaten up inside about this as I have been for months. More then likely why we talk very little now unless it has to do with the cloak. How long have you had the cloak Meg? Did either of you bother to think to tell me that you had it until I inspected Ted? No and now you say you knew that I needed it back as well yet never once did you say O I have it. Not once did anyone tell me No you can’t have it. All I’ve gotten for months now is “nope haven’t got a better cloak yet, holding out for a CotfS and “I’ll think about it”. You want to be pissed fine by me, Look at my side once and think how I’ve been made to feel for months, 0 closure until I have to freaken stoop to a post on a rants and raves board from doing something for a supposed friend. Have a good one.<br>

Yes, Ted is a nice guy we would not of been friends if he wasn't (I use past tense as I feel this has blow things beoynd repair I am guessing, feel free to shoot me a tell if I'm wrong Ted). 99% of our problem is we are both too damn nice (Ted with everyone, me with ppl that don't piss me off and come to think of it that isn't alot of ppl) 1% is communication. One of us needed to tell the other one No a long time ago, and neither of  us could do it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uwistik.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Wistik</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 22<br> <font color=#E9D756>(1/3/02 7:31:05 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2860.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: End to that sad story of lost friends</span><hr size=1> Im sure you will either get That back, or get a new one ;) <p><Html>

<br>
Suddenly Ted is now waiting for a very nice/rare cloak, where before it was just an upgrade, now he does have a wizard twink, when he doesnt unless your counting the access to a wizard in our guild.  First you werent quitting, now you were and didnt but possibly will in the immediate past/future.  <br>
<br>
People slam others about using grammar and punctuation, something which I really dont try to do, but its getting so out of hand to read most of the posts on the few boards I troll due to poor typing skills, laziness to type out full words or use some form of sentence structure, that its a wonder any of you even make it through highschool English.<br>

<br>
and i have logged into ted's account about 5 times maximum, only twice actually playing him, once in lguk when he was lvl 52 and once playing with fire giants one night while he played me.  the other time was camping a piece for his vp key, the other messing around in the tunnel in ec, and the other messing around at karnors zone.  my point?  i have a photographic memory in a sense for these things.  believe it or not.....  if u don't get the point in me stating that, well that's too bad.  anyway, your theory on me playing ted is also wrong.  i have been waiting for you to approach me about this issue tarla.  i knew u were harassing ted for awhile yes, but i didn't know why you were harassing him for the cloak or what your reasoning for demanding the cloak back was.  now i hear that you believe that you loaned the cloak to ted in the attempts to drag his name through the mud.  ted and i talked about this in RL, but neither of us have recollection of this being the case.  so, we are going to stand our ground here, this has become way bigger than a cloak. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uwistik.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Wistik</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 29<br> <font color=#E9D756>(1/4/02 8:05:48 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2860.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: End to that sad story of lost friends</span><hr size=1> Its geting old after three intire posts ;) <p><Html>

<br>
I am really curious. Supposedly neither you nor Ted care about loot at all. You have said so, you have had others say so. Then why don't you give the cloak back? There is no disputing that the cloak was once Tarla's property. Everyone freely admits this to be true. To show that neither of you care one bit about loot, give the cloak back. That is the only way to prove that you are not keeping it because you are a greedy SoBs. I don't understand how either of you think can argue that a gift can't be taken back, without showing yourselves to be selfish people. If you are so giving as you say, give it back. <br>
<br>
I think we all know you will not do this though. You and Ted have both been trying to cloud a very simple issue with lame excuses. And in case you never read the first post about this, Ted's name was never spelled out until he posted on it. Tarla did not drag his name through the mud, he did, so he has only himself to blame.<br>

<br>
sorry you lossed out on a SBC, i'll prolly never see one in my EQ life, but it's only an item, this is only as game, you only knew ted's toon, not the person. i have a RL friend who is a total ass in the game, but he's a good guy IRL. who you meet IG is not the person IRL.<br>
