Your writing style and knowledge are refreshing.<br>
<br>
To whoever wanted to put me down for attending different denominations while still young, calling me a religion shopper or something to that effect:<br>
<br>
I should be ashamed for trying to educate myself? For learning, from the source, different denominational beliefs concerning how to live your life and what comprises a Christian life? I don't think so. Cast aspersions on my character all you like, when I have curiousity about a subject, I educate myself on the matter as much as possible. Then I make up my mind what I think or believe. I don't spend my time half-heartedly. Time is precious, I spend it doing what I enjoy.<br>
<br>
I don't deny anyone else their opinion, neither do I refrain from expressing mine. If that expression sometimes descends to sarcasm, que sera sera. U tend to address certain people in terms they can understand. If it upsets them, that's their problem and not mine. I can't see getting upset about a discussion centering on a subject that has indeed been beaten like a dead horse. Great minds have debated many of the aspects of this discussion throughout the past. As Lanaya stated, the discussion concerning adherence to the Old Testament laws began immediately after the death of Christ. Christ addressed it prior to his death. He basically informed the disciples that salvation was for all mankind, not just the Hebrews. If I remember correctly (all my books are packed still) this discussion was pretty much summed by Christ:<br>
<br>
&quot;...In my father's house are many mansions...&quot;<br>
<br>
If memory serves me, this was part of the culmination of the lesson where Christ basically told the disciples to worry about their own salvation and let everyone else worry about theirs. Not that you couldn't &quot;testify&quot; to others, or minister to others, but that it wasn't the place of the Christian to decide who the Holy Trinity would allow into Heaven; that is, who might be saved. This decision is reserved for the deity. With the exception of denying Christ, he states that no one is beyond salvation.<br>
<br>
This is the origin of the debate about faith and works. If you repent and accept Christ on your death bed, after a life of sin, are you saved? According to the teachings of Christ, yes. According to some denominations, no. <br>
<br>
What was it Christ said about straining at a gnat?<br>

I've read the same bible as the rest of you yahoos. Well, most of you. It's the King James Version. That's the one that, as far as I know, the majority of modern Christians use.<br>
<br>
I know what it is to be Christian. I was a practicing Christian for many years. I'm fairly certain I can tell when someone isn't being true to the laws laid down in the bible for those who are followers of that belief system. Do I really give a fuck? No, not really. It makes no difference to me whether you are truly going to &quot;heaven&quot; or not.<br>
<br>
I think most of you are going to hell anyways. <p><center>

<br>
My father and his father were ministers. But it doesn't take a genius to see that there is much wrong with society that a truly loving God would see fit to set straight if he were so inclined.<br>
<br>
What strikes me about posts like this is there seem to be two main kinds of people who have a nerve struck by it. I honestly don't want to offend anyone and I think many of you make valid points. Someone said it before, there's just no way to be sure given our, admittedly, limited human understanding.<br>
<br>
The first kind of people, the majority it seems, strongly believe in either no god/religion or a god of their own creation. And I suppose it's the forum of an online messageboard attracts diverse opinions like that. Through this thread and many others I've seen people get personally threatened by discussion about God.<br>
<br>
The second kind of people are those who have an active belief in God and his works to the point that they will come here and actively defend, in the face of unbelievers who will ridicule them, their understanding of God and his works.<br>
<br>
I can't help but feel a little admiration for the people who have posted above defending the Christian God and the claims made that he created all things, including man, spontaneously.<br>
<br>
I believe God did, in fact, put the universe in motion. I believe God created the first human and loves his people with all that is within him.<br>
<br>
I believe that the more we attempt to cut God out of our individual and societal lives the more he grants us that wish.<br>
<br>
I believe that God has watched man take his gifts and twist them to his own ends or tried to come up with a more forgiving lord, overseer or greater power that is congruent with their own beliefs. Some people see fit to fashion a god in their own image. <br>
<br>
Before the birth of Christ, many people asked the same questions they are asking today. Where is God? Why does he not help us? We need proof dont we?<br>
<br>
To prove to us that he loves us he led his people out of Egypt. He provided prophets to give us hope. He sent his only son to die in our place. As for proof, every man must decide what he wants to be and, more importantly, what realities he wants and does not want to see.<br>
<br>
I've heard some believe that in a universe disposed to entrophy and chaos that mankind is a backwater eddy in the laws of thermodynamics and physics. We're an accident and our ancestors just happened to get cosmically lucky and come into being.<br>
<br>
I cannot force myself into that belief. I have to believe there is a clockmaker that wound up the universe and is still in the shop. I often ponder, in the nature of chaos, just how many times I would have to throw a dissembled watch into the air before it would land on the table in front of me assembled and ticking. How much more complicated is a woman than a watch?<br>
<br>
So every member of the family of mankind must ask himself, what are you? Are you an beneficial accident and a creation of simply your mother and father and when you are no more that is the end?<br>
<br>
Or, was there a guiding hand that made us and created what we are today?<br>
<br>
I cannot bear to believe that we are an accident. What a sad and lonely world this would be to know that as an accident there is no cosmic design for us, no goals and no future?<br>
<br>
I appreciate that not everyone will think that way. I can see clear arguments that point to evolution of man, worship of other gods and differing religious beliefs as an open and shut case.<br>
<br>
But to see medical professionals post here who have been so blessed with surgeon's hands, people who play EQ with beautiful, healthy infants sleeping in the next room and husbands and wives who are perfect for one another who could not imagine being married to anyone else...I dont see how people cannot see some powerful being moving in their lives.<br>
<br>
Of course evolution should be taught in schools. But just like the religion of science, one cannot demand that God be pushed into a corner. Those who truly wish to debate would consider Creationism and Evolution of man as two theories for which there is both proof and lack of proof.<br>
<br>
The Christians who post here are doing as their God has commanded them, they are asking that you listen to their side of the issue. If you dont care to hear that theory, that is your right.<br>
<br>
But nobody is cramming religion down your throat or trying to indoctrinate your children into fairy tales. Christians have staked their eternal souls on trying to reach people like you.<br>
<br>
Why? So you can ridicule them and make them feel bad? So you can use every opportunity to make them feel stupid and worthless? So you can promote a do-what-you-like ethos?<br>
<br>
When questions like this arise, Christians are compelled to present the version of ancestry that God has revealed to them. Such is the way it is, and will be forever.<br>
<br>
One day every man will be asked to give an accounting of his life and beliefs. I hope to be able to say that I lived according to his will, not my own, no matter how much I wanted to do and believe things my way.<br>

Another insightful post contributing to the discussion. I wish I were so articulate.<br>
<br>
For the ones who mentioned Hitler specifically, I found this interesting link:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.gospelcom.net/tmattingly/1999/col/col.02.17.99.html">www.gospelcom.net/tmattin...17.99.html</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;My feeling as a Christian points me to my Lord and Savior as a fighter,&quot; said Hitler, in one 1922 speech. &quot;It points me to the man who once in loneliness, surrounded by only a few followers, recognized these Jews for what they were and summoned me to fight against them. In boundless love, as a Christian and as a man, I read through the passage which tells us how the Lord rose at last in His might and seized the scourge to drive out of the Temple the brood of vipers and adders.&quot; <br>
<br>
In &quot;Mein Kampf,&quot; Hitler went one terrifying step further as he attacked the &quot;Jewish doctrine of Marxism.&quot; He wrote: &quot;Eternal Nature inexorably revenges the transgressions against her laws. Therefore, I believe today that I am acting in the sense of the Almighty Creator: By warding off the Jews, I am fighting for the Lord's work.&quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
The above paragraphs were the most interesting to me.<br>
<br>
I admire anyone who studies their religion and can discuss it intelligently. I've know many wonderful people who lived their lives as Christ taught, some called themselves Christian, some didn't. <br>
<br>
Faith in your beliefs is fine with me, but the formal, organized religion calling itself Christianity in all it's forms is a perversion the world would be better off without, in my opinion.<br>
<br>
To answer the question, I have yet to find an organized group identifying itself as Christian mirroring the first century church as described by the disciples, converts and other individuals in  available writings, not just the scriptures.<br>
<br>
The belief systems I've studied about, which in my opinion adhere most closely to the original church would have to include the Quaker and Amish groups. That's not to say I think they exactly mirror the first century church, just that they tend to be closest in my opinion. Man changes everything he comes in contact with, so it is with religion also. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/usijandistraightarrow.showPublicProfile?language=EN>sijandistraightarrow</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>p0\/\/3r-p0sT3r!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(1/31/02 12:25:15 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumrantsandravesbalancingissues.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1576.topic&index=324>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Banning evolution: It's the Law....</span><hr size=1> I found this very interesting site.

Q: Where did Um...  come from?<br>
A: Sooner or later, this line of questioning must come back to a single point where nothing became something.  This point, this moment, depending on perspective, is either God (sentient) or Cosmic Pattern (non-sentient). Let's choose God.<br>

<br>
The Mormon faith, away from its trappings, is fundamentally Christian in its outlook and morality. Akin to the Jews becoming irritated that their Bible is now synonymous with the Christians' Old Testament, the Mormons get a lot of flack when they claim the Book of Mormon is another Testament.<br>
<br>
But this just goes back to the argument that there are more types of Christians than there are flavors at Baskin-Robbins. For example, I was raised Catholic and still practice the rites and signs of the faith, but my outlook on the nature of God has shifted more towards the Sufi conception of an illimitable super-Deity that encompasses all concepts of god and antigod. <br>
<br>
If you want my spin, and I have my doubts, I believe Jesus Christ was a physical avatar of this Deity, and thus was legitimate in His claim that He was God. Likewise, the Holy Spirit is the spiritual presence of said Deity. As we are made in His image, and we have body, mind, and spirit, why shouldn't He?<br>
<br>
Divine mystery, my ass. But I digress.<br>
<br>
Because I believe Jesus did exist, was the 'son' of God, taught us ethics and a moral view pleasing to a facet of God, and through following his lead I can achieve a state akin to immortality, I would call myself a Christian.<br>
<br>
And likely be labeled a heretic by most every church in existence. C'est la vie. <p><BR><CENTER><IMG SRC="http://personal.bellsouth.net/jax/f/j/fjferry/img/ezb-euphemism3.jpg" ALT="Syuni's Personal Signature" BORDER=1></CENTER><BR><CENTER>ShadowKnight of the 20th Circle</CENTER></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/utyralthekithless.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tyral the Kithless</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Boardaholic</span><br> <font color=#000033>(1/31/02 4:44:16 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumrantsandravesbalancingissues.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1576.topic&index=346>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://secondrising.8m.com/images/smilies/iamwithstupid.gif height=46 width=41></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Banning evolution: It's the Law....</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Huh.

However, members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (Mormons) also use the King James Bible. I'd have thought the actual name of the church would give it away that they're Christians, but I guess most people don't seem to realize that Mormon isn't the actual name of the faith.<br>

I thought it would interesting to find out from someone who claims the moral authority to determine who is a Christian and who isn't what his response would be if someone did the same to him.<br>
<br>
And I found out.<br>

And it was pathetically easy.  <p><center><img src="http://www.darke.net/journalpix/bearne.jpg"><BR>

Just so you know, Tranthas, they were likely NOT Mormons. Mormon missionaries (the ones that go door to door) are <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> highly</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> trained individuals. Think basic training for the religious. There's no way on earth they would have said &quot;the Book of Mormon is more important than the Bible&quot; or anything remotely resembling that. And Mormon Missionaries would have had an answer to every question. Yes, they are that well trained.<br>
<br>
There are, however, groups that pretend to be LDS and walk around, door-to-door, making an attempt at giving Mormons a bad name in certain areas. (Yes, there really are people whose lives are that empty.) They will be rude, insulting, condescending, and have very little knowledge about the actual religion. Their entire purpose is to make you, in the least, wary about Mormons if not hostile.<br>
<br>
If you ever have serious problems with a pair of missionaries, get their names (ALL Mormon missionaries wear name tags that say Elder Soandso - The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints) and call the local church. Make sure, for one, that the guys were actually Mormon, and then file a complaint with the Bishop. If they ARE Mormon, and your complaint seems valid, they will ship those motherfuckers right back to Boot Camp. <p><center>
