yes i know that GEBS have more wis then the black fur boots but the instant manaless sow is beyond replacing. i would love to have a pair but i wont die if i dont ever get them. that is still better buffs and slows. and yes he does have bane of nife. i went to sol b because i had the time to play  and was asked. for a change whats int it for me was not asked. i went because they had asked to come nothing more. so dont go saying i went in order to get a pair. <br>
read the part where shantara had said something like <br>
<br>
&quot; i bet had he known that everyone in the party had GEBS or better an the first pair to drop would be his he probably would have stuck around and died, or at least helped with the CR.&quot;<br>
<br>
 When in fact i had suggested a place that all could have got something that could have helped them. the divine inspiration off the gorganaga cheiftian + 15 wis. range really nice for shaman as we cant use range. and druids are wis casters. cant recall if clerics are wis or int casters same with pallys. plus a pick lock modifer rogue only gloves.  so you see possibly something for everyone. so as far as a CR to places that can have major downsides. no way.yes i know about immoblize. last much shorter max time cost more mana with about 1.5 sec faster cast time. the mana cost + max possible duration - cast time to me makes that not worth it to cast. so therefore enstill. much like death + rez exp &lt; or = total exp means gate. and you didnt get the part about where that is taking aggro off pet when mob is at deaths door you ass. what do you go for kidin? base wis  and shoot for warrior status? troll have low base wis so to say i got my wis beyond 200 is a feat. all my gear minus the horse has + wis . for me no + wis i wont hardly be interested if its for my shaman, and no my necro buddy didnt PL me. i received no PLs of any way shape or form unlike you  kid.  as far as my military dates that has been classified because of the places i had to go. even us lowly turck drivers have to go to places we cant say. needless to say if i was afflicited with gulf war syndrone then that place cant be mentioned as it wasnt mentioned in the media, but what would you know? you are some low life, vagabong that dont mean jack squat to me . you are as insignifigant to me as my father is. that loser. yes you heard me my fater is a loser that cant fend for himself and has to play leech off family<br>
<br>
and the faction part. what would a troll need with bard faction from raiding in MM? and the tracking thing. i have no clue on the whole idea besides you can always find a mob or player. all i have is my shaman and warrior.  i tryed to play a few lvs of all the classes but were just to blah. i can barely divide my play time between the 2 i do have.<br>
<br>
as you said kid<br>
<br>
&quot;I don't care if you were a naked wizard w/ 300hp &amp; a lousy mana pool, you still should have assisted on the CR.&quot;. <br>
<br>
how can a player like that help? yes wizards are the best nukers, but why bother. you are just like me. pig headed, stubborn and wont move till you get your point across. i will be the first to admit to that and you know what in most cases  it ends a stalemate i wont budge. you cant make me do anything i dont want to or refuse to do. <br>
<br>
<br>
 and when it comes to my gear. i never let people barrow my gear.  i have learned from RL and from EQ trust has to be earned but when money or valuables are concerned you barely trust anyone. even your family. and the mass wis gear i have aquired is way to costly to just say&quot; here ya go&quot;  would you let anyone barrow  a CoF or FBSS? if i had one on my warrior. no i wouldnt.  us shaman sure the crap can not melee. we can but not worth the sta we are wasting on swinging the weapon of choose. and the planes of power. who needs it? it took me to long to get up to where i am now. why would i want to start over?<br>
<br>
yes i do recall saying <br>
<br>
&quot;I'm emotionless due to being in the military&quot;. the military is good for a few things.<br>
1. killing the emotional heart strings a person has<br>
2. making a person an @#%$<br>
3. if already one a bigger one.<br>
4 and the biggest of all making something simple and making it complicated. example in the smartbook that all service members get. it actually tells you how to tie your shoes. OMG if you cant do that by 5 then you need to wear the padded helmet. tieing your shoes is like reading. i know there are people that are to  inempt to learn how that they lie and cheat and pass the buck with one excuse or another to have others do that for them<br>
<br>
and as far as the UCMJ is concerned /rude, /finger.<br>
<br>
my ideas of the military do not contradict any of that.<br>
1. had the military/government had honor then why did they not disclose the JFK death/murder coverup?<br>
2 why would they let those of us who has this BS of an afflication called gulf war syndrome be nothing but test subjects. for crying out loud we were hit with chemical warfare.<br>
<br>
as far as the FF and furniture jobs. i worked for the furniture before i enlisted. just a few months but the military time still counted as far as being an active employee. and the training i recieved in the military with having to do inventory and account for items along with having worked there previously landed me the manager position.  i have a hard enough time remembering last week with have to write it down. war in any case is horrible. regardless of the place or time, but the worlds power seems to feed on wars. regardless of when i was there. the fighting never ceased. personally i feel that america should turn the other cheek and instead of sending billions of dollars to people that praise us when we are there and burn the american flag when we arent there. spend it here on the people of america. help the homeless or something, but we cant be &quot;BIG BROTHER&quot; to the whole friggen world.  let them settle it then when it gets to our front door then settle it. just as we all have heard once or twice . <br>
<br>
&quot;Keep your friends close and your enemies closer.&quot;<br>
<br>
look away but have a plan incase the fight comes to you. like me some one come beating down my door i have 8 rounds of death to cram down their neck. blasted brady bill  <br>
for those who may know command sargent major Doan. he was one of my CO's that i told to take a hike as well as an staff sargent to kiss my ass. those that dont respect me get none in return. no matter who or what you are to me <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ukeldarn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Keldarn</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_lightning.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 114<br> <font color=#E9D756>(9/27/02 12:56:20 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3663.topic&index=162>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: yea right</span><hr size=1> Who?

Total of 269 american dead in the gulf war.<br>
<br>
Take this number and compare it to the number of US Military Personnel in the theatre during the Gulf War..540,000. that means 1 out of every 2000 people died.<br>
<br>
So derive what you want of kilmals chances of knowing anyone who actually died...<br>
<br>
If he worked with helicopters the chances are fairly good. IF he worked with basketballs, no much chance.<br>
