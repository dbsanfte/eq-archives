Quote:<br>
 When we step away from balance we learn fear, pain and suffering. While in balance we have love, peace, harmony. While in balance we have freedom from effort.<br>
<br>
Hmm, I see what you are saying but you seem to be coming from one angle.  I agree from that one angle, but think the other angle balances it out; here is what I see.  Your first sentence doesn’t mention the other angle excitement (fear), growth (pain) and suffering (passion).  Punishment?  Penalty?  I agree they exist from a certain perspective.  <br>
<br>
While in balance we also have truth (love), discipline (peace) and structure (harmony).<br>
<br>
“freedom from effort” seems a rather pitiful existence, but at the same time could insinuate a mastery of some sort (a task or ability if you will).  Don’t get me wrong here.  I’m not claiming to know all the answers rather it’s just an opinion.  2 does seem to be the magic number, but only describes the existence of the two major forces for balance; love and truth, rather than the actual interaction between the two forces.  The part that we often fail to recognize is the point at which they meet, and their natural tendency to react over time.  <br>
<br>
I think validating truth and love as equals is part of the learning process or fear, pain and suffering as you put it.  I also believe that while truth is painful at times, it very much a valid contributor towards love peace and harmony.  However, if our experiences of love bring pain, we might formulate pain as truth and weakness as love.  Hence the following equation as a mirror to the structure of your three sentences:  <br>
<br>
Pain (substituted for love) + harmony (relief of pain) = weakness.  <br>
<br>
1.)In this case, truth (or in other comparisons thought or order) supersedes love in validity.  2.) However, anger (chaos or some other reaction of feeling or ‘love) and the result of a lack of validity for love might cause an imbalance for truth (or in other words anger towards truth)  3.) Finally, the two collide together in an act of chaos and finally, when the smoke clears, one finds nothing, or peace, or in other words, freedom from effort.<br>
<br>
From a truth perspective I agree with you wholeheartedly, but love is equal to truth and believe the validation of the two create a harmonious balance.  I am learning as I write.  Thank you for the engaging thought and feeling.<br>

<br>
Brutas, all that you write I see has application. I can really only share my point of view. I can't say what is right, on this score. I can share an exerpt from the Venerable Sumedho Bhikku. You can read this at http://www.sukhi.com:<br>
<br>
I apologise for the length of the article but I find it compelling. It concerns the 4th Noble Truth.<br>
<br>
<i>THE FOURTH NOBLE TRUTH<br>
<br>
The Fourth Noble Truth is the Noble Eightfold Path. The first of the eight factors in the path is Right View (samma ditthi), which develops from having seen and experienced cessation. To have Right View requires that we be very mindful all the time. We must know that everything arises and passes away and is not self - this must be a direct experience, an insight. Right View is based on direct insightful knowing, not just thinking and believing in the concept. As long as you don't really know but just think you know, you will always be in a state of uncertainty and be confused. This is because intellectual knowing is based on symbols alone, not on direct experience of the truth.<br>
<br>
The second factor of the path is Right Attitude, or Right Intention (samma sankappa). Once you have Right View, then your intention from that moment on is towards nirvana (nibbana) or the uncreated - towards liberation. You still feel impulses and habitual tendencies like doubt, worry, or fear pulling you back into the sensory world, but you recognise these impulses now. You know them as they are, and you can no longer delude yourself for very long with those conditions.<br>
<br>
Together, Right View and Right Attitude are referred to as wisdom (panna), and they take you to the third, fourth and fifth aspects of the path: Right Speech, Right Action, and Right Livelihood (sammavaca, samma kammanta, samma ajiva). In the Pali language, these three are called sila - the moral side of the Eightfold Path. Sila means doing good and refraining from doing evil with bodily action and speech. Right View and Right Attitude encourage sila because once you see the truth, you are no longer inclined to use your body or speech for harming yourself or other beings. You feel responsible; you are not going to misuse your own body or someone else's, or cause harm to other beings intentionally. You may do that unintentionally, but you don't have the intention to hurt. That's the difference.<br>
<br>
When there is sila, there is emotional balance and we feel at peace. Because we don't hurt or steal or lie, there are no regrets, we are not guilt ridden, and there is a feeling of calm, equanimity, and humility. From this feeling of peace come the sixth, seventh, and eighth aspects of the path: Right Effort, Right Mindfulness, and Right Concentration (samma vayana, samma sati, samma samadhi). With effort, mindfulness and concentration, the passive and active are in balance. It's like learning to walk: you are always going off balance and falling down, but in that very process you're developing strength, just as a baby does. A baby learning to walk develops strength by depending on its mother and father, by depending on the table and chairs, and by falling down and hurting itself and picking itself up again. Eventually it takes two steps, then it begins to walk, and finally it begins to run. Once you know what it means to be in balance, then it's no problem - you can walk, you can run, you can twirl around, you can leap.<br>
<br>
So we can divide the Eightfold Path into three sections: sila, samadhi, and panna. Sila is morality, samadhi is concentration, panna is wisdom. Sila is how you conduct yourself, how you live your life, how you use your body and speech. Samadhi is the balance of the emotions. When you have good samadhi, love is free from selfish desire, free of lust and trying to get something from someone. With emotional balance, there is a kind of joy and love. You're not indifferent, but you have balance. You can love because there's nothing else to do. That's the natural relationship when there's no self. But when selfishness arises, then love becomes lust, compassion becomes patronising, joy becomes selfish greed for happiness. When there's no self, joy is natural and compassion is a spontaneous arising of the mind. Panna is wisdom, knowing the truth so that there is perfect harmony between the body, the emotions, and the intellect. With wisdom, these three are all working together helping each other as one, rather than as three conflicting forces.<br>
<br>
In Theravadan Buddhist practice, the Four Noble Truths are all that are contemplated. As we meditate and live more mindfully and more carefully, these truths will become very clear to us through direct experience. So when the Buddha was asked what he believed in or taught he said "I teach suffering, its origin, cessation, and path." The Brahmins would ask, "Is there a God?" "What happens to the Enlightened One when he passes away?" But all the Buddha would say was, "All that arises passes away and is not self. There is suffering, it has a beginning and an end, and there's a way out of it. That's all I teach." Brilliant minds, great intellectuals, have all kinds of ideas about ultimate reality and utopian philosophies. They have magnificent systems of reason and logic, but they don't know their own bodies and minds. They haven't learned from the conditions they experience all the time.</i><br>
<br>
How the above affects me is that when in balance I am truly liberated. Life become effortless. The best way to describe this, I think, is through throwing. In martial arts those who are out of balance are limited to brute force in order to throw their opponent. Most of the time, that means the martial artist must man handle and their efectiveness becomes limited on their own size. However, when in balance the martial artisist is mindful of not only their balance, but that which would tend to shift their balance. Usually, the "that" is the opponent. By maintaining balance the opponenet is tossed like a little doll through the air with no effort at all. It is simply an exercise in maintaining an effortless state. Much like a board perfectly balanced on a fulcrum. The board is unaffected by gravity at either end since it is fully rooted in the center of the fulcrum. <p><center><font face="arial" color="CCFFFF">Lurikeen Mali'Kyre</FONT></center><center><table style='Filter: Shadow(Color=#150517, Direction=225)'><tr><td><span class='Necromancer'><font size=2 color="red" face="arial"><i>NECROMANCER</span></td></tr></table></font></i></center><center><font face=arial></center><center><I>"My eyes will pierce your soul, then I will take your life!"</I></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ulithahntalon.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lith Ahntalon</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/image/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 302<br> <font color=#E9D756>(5/26/02 1:19:34 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=300.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Share something inspirational!

I found this article very interesting.  I particularly enjoyed the above statement about ‘perverse love’.  Perverse truth also causes much confusion in the same way.  <br>
<br>

<br>
Funny that you use this example because I was going to write about a see-saw as the most basic example of balance.  Pretty neat.  It begins as simple mathematics with two opposing forces who act and react to each other to create balance, but when an extreme act of love or truth is generated, the see-saw becomes unstable due to too much emphasis from a love or truth perspective which would then be considered a ‘perverse action’.  Or, an action of some extreme that is not necessary for a reasonable balance.   I’m not saying extreme acts of truth or love are bad, rather extreme acts are good as long as they provide a force that has purpose for attainment of ‘balance’.  If it does not have purpose, it is unnecessary, or ‘perverse’.  And by unnecessary, I am not only speaking of truth, but love as well.  <br>
<br>
IMO, the laws of love and truth are just as real as laws of physics.  I don’t know if you remember our past discussions over spirituality and the physical world Lurikeen, but this topic is the same as we discussed a few months ago.  I had a difficult time explaining it because I haven’t created any advanced equations to prove it, but the basic idea is very simple.  The logic is really no different than a graph with positive and negative quadrants.  Very interesting stuff.
