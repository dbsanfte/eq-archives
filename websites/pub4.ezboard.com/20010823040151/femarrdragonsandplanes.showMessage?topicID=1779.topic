You worthless piece of shit have earned the first /ignore in the almost two years that I have played EQ.<br>
<br>
A little background info, let me set the mood for all of you:<br>
<br>
I am a level 25 Warrioress and yesterday, Sunday the 8th I was looking for a group, went to Mistmoore no one there so I went to unrest.  Got into a group of 15 to 25, me being the highest.  I was paying protector somewhat well Van was part of this first group and he died in an unfortunate train.  He was bound in Queynos of all places so we checked and saw that a cleric was in Crushbone.  So I figured well check with him and I will throw in 30pp for you, now mind you I am not rich but I felt sorry for the guy.  Anyway about a half hour has passed or so and we still have him in the group.  The cleric arrives I pay him 30pp as a downpayment with the rest to be paid by Van.  <br>
<br>
Well our group has to reform and there is now a more high level oriented group around 20 to 25.  Well we had not yet invited Van back into our fold when I get the tell from the cleric, pretty upset saying he was ripped off and such and such.  I listen to his said of the story and I listen to Van's and after about a half hour I have a migraine and I am not sure who is telling the truth.  The group leader Rasha, decdies that it is best that he join another group where he could make some really nice experiance and we tell him that.  HE throws a tantrum at which we pretty much just ignore him, well Rasha goes linkdead, so we reform again.  While waiting for Rasha we pull some undead 2 blues and three greens we can handle it no problem.  We had one warrior and two paladins.  No big deal, when all of a sudden Van runs towards us with a boat-load of high level undead, needless to say we all died except Van who ran and made it to the zone.  Well that little piece of shit bragged about how he trained us and needless to say we reported and petitioned his little ass.  then he starts sending tells saying that he was proud so needless to say I put the little worthless son of a bitch mother fucker on my ignore list.<br>
<br>
So Van, I hope it was worth it your little tantrum earned the wrath of a cleric who will never give you a rezz along with his guild members, you pretty much pissed on someone who showed you kindness and helped you out when you needed it most and hopefully everyone that reads these boards will know what a worthless piece of shit you really are and avoids you and spreads the word.  For you my friend did what no one has ever done before you pissed me off enough to go on my ignore list and you pissed off a lot of people that might have helped you as you progressed in levels.<br>
<br>
<br>
So fuck you Van and I hope to god that the bitch that pushed you out between her loins was fixed and I hope that you will have your manhood ripped off by a woman in real life after they find out what a fucking moron and asswipe and son of a bitch mother fucker poor excuse for a person ever to walk on God's everloving green earth that you really are.<br>

<br>
I was in Kulana's group, and have a different side to tell. And I take partial responsibility for that train he pulled. Going by the tells he sent me, it was aimed at me and not the group. Had I kept my mouth shut, it wouldn't have happened.<br>
<br>
When I joined Kulana's group, he was already in the process of annyoing them. I decided to not get invloved. Finally, he asked if any of us had ever been turned down for a group. I said:<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, many times. Somtime even due to my level. I usually just moved along and found another group or another hunting spot, rather than whine like a 12-year old.&quot;<br>
<br>
To which he said:<br>
<br>
&quot;Shut the fuck up human Pally...&quot;<br>
<br>
Medion: Some advice Vardoc, don't ask a question if you don't want an honest answer.<br>
<br>
Vardoc: I didn't ask a question you idiot.<br>
<br>
Medion: You said, and I quote, &quot;Have any of you ever been turned down for a group.&quot;<br>
<br>
Medion: Going by your sentence structure, starting with a question wod, ending with a question mark, it seems like a question to me.<br>
<br>
Incoming pull:<br>
<br>
Vardoc: Yea, I asked that...<br>
<br>
Vardoc leaves...<br>
<br>
few seconds go by, Vardoc runs by with a train...<br>
<br>
I was the last to die, making it a few steps out of the mansion. I respawn in GFay and am greeted by tells from Vardoc. I decided not to flame him right off the bat...<br>
<br>
Vardoc: Looks like you had a bit of trouble. You should know better to avoid trains.<br>
<br>
Medion: Aye, but this happens every now and then. You get used to it.<br>
<br>
Vardoc: If you didn't start with me, I wouldn't have trained you.<br>
<br>
Medion: Well, if you hadn't acted like an immature brat, you wouldn't have been insulted by me. I only called you what you were.<br>
<br>
Vardoc: I'm immature!? You're probably some college grad who sits home jacking off all day to wood elves. (my comment:I prfer High Elves, thank you)<br>
<br>
Medion: Thank you for proving my point about your maturity.<br>
<br>
Vardoc: Oh, maturity is important? Well, those who try to be mature aren't mature.<br>
<br>
At this point, I loot my corpse, and am immediately attacked. Our group is doing ok till the second train hits. Note, these are not from Vardoc. Our second warrior, Xvor, is quickly going down, so I LH him. Now several of the mobs are on me. As soon as everyone else starts to run, I bring up the rear, and die near the zone. Another respawn in GFay, and another series of tells from Vardoc.<br>
<br>
Vardoc: Looks like you died again <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Medion: Yea, looks like its going to be one of those days. You make it out?<br>
<br>
Vardoc: You should really learn how to Lay Hands.<br>
<br>
Medion: I know how to use it and what it i sused for. I LHed my groupmate, not myself.<br>
<br>
Vardoc: Oh, you're so nice.<br>
<br>
Medion: And I'm sure you could be too, but too bad first impressions suck ass.<br>
<br>
I get into the zone, and loot my corpse. What's Vardoc doing? He is healing Xvor and Kulana, He's saying in /ooc:<br>
<br>
&quot;Sorry for the train guys, it was an accident, I swear.&quot;<br>
<br>
When Kulana left, I became the puller. Someone trained Magi and Hag on me, so rather than pull to my group, I wemt out the door and zoned the bastages, while shouting to let the zone know. In other words, ahd it been an accident, there were two otehr doors Vardoc could have used. And I'd of used the front door which is closer to the zone, rather than the back door that we were camping. He's a liar and an ass kisser. <p>Feign Death...who needs it when you got the real thing...</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/umedionpalemoon.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Medion Palemoon</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 323<br> <font color=#E9D756>(4/9/01 3:30:03 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Beat me to the punch :)</span><hr size=1> &quot;BTW, the name is Vandroc&quot;<br>
