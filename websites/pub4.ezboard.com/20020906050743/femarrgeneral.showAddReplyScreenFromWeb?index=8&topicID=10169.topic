<br>
You had WinME, upgraded it in-place to XP, then installed a new video card after the fact, and now have a new modem as well. Windows is nowhere near as upgradeable as MS keeps telling us it is, and those in-place upgrades have somewhere around a 1.6% success rate.<br>
<br>
To make matters worse, Windows ME was the worst OS Microsoft ever put out. Even with an in-place upgrade a lot of the crap still exists.<br>
<br>
Simple fix? Put the Windows XP disk in, boot the computer, and reinstall. This time when it gets to the section where it asks what partition to install on select the primary partition and press D, then Enter, then L. You'll lose everything on that drive, but when Windows gets reinstalled your problems will most likely have magically dssapeared. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ukerryndarkwater.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kerryn Darkwater</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 1847<br> <font color=#E9D756>(7/23/02 5:44:30 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrgeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=10169.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: EQ connection problems - Need help from those who can</span><hr size=1> Sorry but I can't state just how wrong you are on that one. <br>
<br>
I was told this exact same thing a while back and I checked that because my only copy of XP is an upgrade version ( a lot of people have these ) and I was upgrading from 98. I wanted to make sure that I didn't have any dodgy files from 98 when I installed. First off I checked MS help site and their is an article their about the upgrade procedure. You can find it by searching for upgrade at microsoft.com. In it is categorically states that an upgrade of 98 or ME will put the computer in the exact same state that it would be in following a full format and reinstall of XP.<br>
<br>
This was later confirmed to me when I spoke to Microsoft regarding a similar query regarding what we should purchase for the office here.<br>
<br>
You can't upgrade to XP from 2000 as it does not contain the correct files and you cannot upgrade from 95 1st edition for the same reason.<br>
<br>
Please dont advise people to format their machine whilst other options exist. It's costly and time consuming and it doesnt help solve the problem. It just avoids it. <p><CENTER><A HREF="http://ak.lonelygamer.com">

<br>
I'd like to take up that idea of formatting over upgrading.  Please be advised that MS HAS to tell you that the system will be in the exact state it needs to be in whether you upgrade or re-install.  This is their POLICY.  If they don't tell you that, you might think their operating systems don't work as they are intended to... Goddess forbid anyone would consider MS a flakey operating system.<br>
<br>
There are numerous inconsistencies with upgrading over re-installing.  You can even verify this by searching the same knowledgebase you found your original article in.  If it was as flawless as MS reports it to be, there would be NO NEED for this same knowledgebase.<br>
<br>
I don't speek to you as one that only dables at home with this OS.  I've been forced to deal with MS operating systems since waaaaaay before Windows came into existance and am speaking from profession and personal experiences.  Sometimes you get lucky (and I do mean it) when you upgrade and everything works correctly.  Most of the time however you will not be this fortunate.  <br>
<br>
I'd like to point out that there was a very good idea posted earlier about IRQ's and your BIOS.  I was going to post the same info after reading all the posts to ensure I didn't duplicate someones idea.  I'd definately check that one.  After that, try uninstalling your modem completely and then re-installing the driver.  <br>
<br>
Please don't take this as an attack or a flame.  I'm only pointing out (like you) that everyone has a different experiences when it comes to their OS and there is not one path that always works.<br>

If that we're so surely it would be their policy to tell you that the full version is better considering the upgrade is cheaper and nets them less money.<br>
<br>
If it is indeed the policy to tell people that it is the same and it isn't they would be begging for a law suit. Sorry,..another law suit.<br>
<br>
Whereas I agree that on occasions upgrades do not work I refuse to believe that the success rate is anywhere near as low as 1.6%. I've upgraded hundreds of machines over a 4 year period including over 50 upgrades of 98 and ME to XP. If it was anywhere near 1.6% I'd have had installed.....exactly .8 computers succesfully. So far Im on 100% success rate.<br>
<br>
The reason that full formats appear smoother is that when you upgrade to XP it won't have any issues with software or drivers because you won't have any installed. Whereas it will report them in an upgrade. However a full format has the benefit of getting rid of faulty files from 3rd party which may be causing errors.<br>
<br>
Although I agree that it is good to have a clearout of your sytem now and again I think the problem is that often a full format can be quicker then solving the issue at hand. This leads to ( no disrespect intended to other computer technicians who have ever advised a format ) sloppy technicians who scream format before they've even looked at the issue.<br>
<br>
It also leads to the industry being populated by people fresh out of college with a very basic qualification thinking they are up to a job they are not. Simply as soon as they get any problem they format and reinstall and they've &quot;fixed the error&quot; <p><CENTER><A HREF="http://ak.lonelygamer.com">

Which do you believe someone will buy...an upgrade that is supposed to solve all their woes by just inserting a cd and following the screen prompts; or a full version that will have them doing things on a pc they have only read about in a magazine?<br>
<br>
MS techsupport is filled with the same people that you you describe as &quot;fresh out of college&quot;.  Their tier one techsupport (the people most of us get to chat with) are using their limited personal knowledge of problem solving along with helpdesk software that has standard questions they need to ask.  I'll say that again, STANDARD QUESTIONS that are in a database they search as soon as you give them enough info on your error.  That's why you get questions like: &quot;Is the little light on the monitor green or yellow?&quot;  or &quot;Is the machine plugged in?&quot;<br>
<br>
To most computer geeks these questions are unwarranted and downright degrading.  However to a vast majority of PC owners they seem like intelligent and well thought out debugging techniques.  AND make the person on the other end seem godlike.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I'm not downgrading helpdesk personnel.  I've been in that seat and believe me it's not one I'd wish on anyone.  It's just that they have their rules and policies to follow.  Yes, it is MS's policy to tell you their stuff works as it's intended to work.  They'd be foolish not too say that.  This does not open them up to any type of lawsuit due to the fact that it is true.<br>
<br>
However, this truth is like the truth you hear from politicians at election time.  It's only true in certain contexts.  MS's software upgrade path is successful 100% of the time if you upgrade with the same standards as their QA testing.  Now I know of no one that even knows what that standard is let alone anyone that has ever followed it.  My personal thought however that it does not entail upgrading with any other applications installed that do not bear the MS label.  How many systems do you think MS tests that have Lotus Notes installed?  Netscape?  EQ?  I'd wager a guess of not many.<br>
<br>
A full re-install of an operating system is the only guarenteed way to ensure there are no problems carried over from one operating system to the next.  If your operating system is working well and you wish to upgrade to the latest and greatest then you will probably not experience any problems.  I agree that there are many alternatives to a full format/reinstall but to say it's not neccessary a majority of the time is in my estimation incorrect.<br>
<br>
I wish you luck on your problem and hope there will be an insightful post here to debugging your problem. <p><b>May the Circle be unbroken</b><br><br>
