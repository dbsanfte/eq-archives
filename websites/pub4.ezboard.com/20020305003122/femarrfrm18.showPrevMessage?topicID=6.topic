The hard part will be making the distinction between the former two and the latter.  We will make mistakes..so be it..such is the price of war.  Secondly..we must not monopolize what few resources of Afganistan that there are..and there aren't many.

I believe it is important that we identify true sources of terrorists threats for the unrestrained response could kill many innocents that are no threat and create the anarchy we are fighting to avoid.<br><br>That being said anyone who happens to live near a terrorist these days will have to look out for themselves as I do not believe we should allow the murders to escape because they have found our determination flounders when innocents are in the path of our anger.  I am more concerned for the innocents here in the US that do not deserve to die, as they will die, in the next terrorist act, those responsible for the destruction on Sept. 11, will perpetrate.  Make no mistake, these people are pure evil.  If what they did in New York and DC did not convince you of the depths of their hatred and resolve, I do not know what will.  There is no diplomatic solution that can be reached when your enemy will sacrifice their lives to take out a disproportionate number of US citizens, whose only crime was they got up and went to work that day.  If we do not stop these terrorists they will strike again.  We cannot assume otherwise and we must take steps to ensure this does not happen.  If that means that an innocent person is killed because they did not have the good sense get out of Dodge, well better them than us.  I will vote for them being the ones dead everytime.<br><br>If you think this view is extreme it is only because we live in America which is a very politically correct country.  Try that stuff in Israel and see what you get.<br><br>We have no choice but to meet this adversity with resolve and steel ourselves for whatever sacrifices must be made by us so that our children will live in a safer world.  We did it in World War II and we must do so again.  Evil of this nature cannot go unchallenged anymore than Hilter's could for it's purpose is to demoralize us and conquer us with our own fear.  They just don't know us very well.  That will change. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uzariel.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Zariel</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www."

If we hit or as we have said we will hit (in not so many words) Any country harboring Bin Laden (if it is him) He will move.. it has be said he is already on the move.  So who is to say he is still in Afganistan??<br><br>Now the Taliban...<br><br>THEY feel that should be the rightful rulers of Afganistan and if I am correct, Pakastan sees this to be as well.  IF we were to bomb them and they do weaken even slightly, the other faction will move in and reclaim the goverment.  Now I dont have all the names and titles of this, and maybe it merits more research to see.. but this brings up one of 2 things.. IMO.<br><br>1.  If we hit and the faction does move in that is contesting the Taliban.. well th at COULD be better for the US.<br><br>2.  IF the Taliban were to be scared of an attack, they MAY turn over Bin Laden. Now if he is on the move, even tho I had heard reports of his being under house arrest.. poing being they may gie the US what they want in order to keep their part in power.  HOWEVER, we must not forget that Bin Laden is the cash cow for them... <p><font color=magenta>Fori Shadowmoon</font><P><font color=pink><i>"Though I got more hooks Than Madonna got looks.
