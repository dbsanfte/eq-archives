<br>
Yesterday I get home from work after a really bad night shift, eyes blury and feeling like I just wanted to go to sleep.  I needed to return an Item which friend gave me to play with called a Dark Ember.<br>
<br>
Now, I was talking to my friend Cashew the Gnome and he was in The EC tunnle.  I notice a Gnome wearing the familar robes we fought so hard to get and glimpsed the P in his guild name.<br>
<br>
I sat down infront of him with a full tunnle of people about and handed the DE to the Gnome whom I mistook for my friend.  Told my fried I was logging on my other char for a moment then procceded to log off.<br>
<br>
Loggin back in I suddenly realised that My friend was asking me where I was, to pick up the Item he was comming for and then noticed the Gnome I had accutaully given the DE too.  I approched Darkmastah and asked him politly to return the Item and explained I had given it to him in error.  He said nothing.<br>
<br>
I sat infront of him again this time pleading with him to return the item and even used the /plead about 20 times.  After about 10 mins of no response I did a /who all Pax and contacted Helena who was the Highest ranking Pax member on at the time and informed her of what happened.<br>
<br>
Needless to say after 20mins Darkmastah finnaly asked me why I should give it back to which I pleaded with him again it was not intended for him and I had given it to him by mistake(Yes i did and still do feel like a complete idiot)<br>
<br>
I then informed him that I have /reported the matter to a GM and his response was. They will not do anything, they are usless.<br>
<br>
40mins into the saga the GM appeared and noted his account details and just prior to this I watched Riff Raff(Pax) ask Darkmastah to return the item.  Darkmastah then left his Guild sat down and started to camp.  The GM was speaking to him as Dark camped out.<br>
<br>
In my opinion, this is the behaviour of someone who is not honest, has no morales, has no respect for other and is not a people person.<br>
<br>
I on the other hand try to live by the rules, Do unto others how you would have them do unto you.  Give that of yourself that increases your self.  Be all you can be and encorage others to be that they can be.<br>
<br>
*note: Yes I am to blame for giving him the item in the first place.  <br>
Yes I am to blame for being to trusting of people.<br>
Yes, I am sorry that this person feels he needs to take things from others to satisfy his own needs.<br>
<br>
Dear Pax,<br>
<br>
I am sorry if this has in anyway caused you trouble, either in the guild or outside of it.  I do hope you find out who the other member of your guild is who the twink Darkmastah belonged to is, and if you can find it in your hearts to re-embuses my friend Cashew for the loss, I will do my best to assist you in anyway I can.<br>
<br>
Dear Darkmastah,<br>
<br>
You have taken the life and joy i once had in this game away from me.  I have been told that because you have been ripped off in the past, you feel just in hurting me.  I feel you will one day learn that not everyone in this world wants to hurt you.  I may never trust you or those that would hide you from the truth again.  But i do feel sad that you could not find a place inside of you that was willing to do the right thing.<br>
<br>
I play everquest because it filled me with joy knowing that I helped someone in some small way.  I know there are scammers out there and i am weary of them.  I will not lable you as a scammer because you only choose not to return something given to you in error.  if I was to lable you anything it would only be unforgiving.<br>
<br>
Good luck to you in your quest for peace, I would find it very hard to live with myself had I been placed with the guilt of such a sorry act.<br>
<br>
<br>
To everyone else that has read this far I thank you for your time, And i hope somewhere in my errors you can find a better way to do things.  Be safe, fight hard but most of all think of others.<br>

When we find out we will #1 remove him from the guild.  #2 post his mains name here, it is against our policy to publicly have conflict but in this case I believe he should be responsible for his actions.  From the information I currently have it appears this person is still on their trial in the guild (very new), we believe we know who his sponsors were.  This act was in direct violation of our rules, and I apologise that it happened.  I will try to make resistitution for the item pls contact me in game I dont have any dark ember thing on me but I might have something of approximate value.<br>

You accidently gave him the item it really wasnt a matter of trust... but the honorable thing to do would have been to give it back.  I thank cashew for sending me a personal email about this...

I've tracked down, with the assitance of Pax, Darkmastahs main characters name and passed it onto every guild I have contacts in.<br>
<br>
  That pretty much means every high level guild in the game, and a few of the lower ones as well.<br>
<br>
  Pax has been helpful and courteous every step of the way:  I knew they would be as I have yet to see Pax as a guild fail to act with honor.  My heartfelt congratulations to Pax for doing the right thing.  I shall leave it to you to decide if you want to put his main characters name on this board.<br>
<br>
  To Darkmastah:  if that was your other twink that called me Cuntlicker before logging off, I've reported and petitioned you.  It is my fondest hope that you get your ass banned.  I can also assure you that I've spread the word as far and wide as I can... I doubt VERY much that you will ever join a good guild again.  All actions have consequences, and it's long since time you learned this. Have a nice life.<br>

Thank you all for your assistance in this matter.  It is truly a sad day when someone is lost to the folds of dishonor.  But as the mighty guild Pax Familla have shown, honor is not dead.<br>
<br>
Laoke, thank you as well for everything you have done to help.  It is always nice to know the people you live with a true friends <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Perhaps now we can put this matter behind us an and hope that peace will come eventually and those of ill repute will have their computers resposessed or there allowance cut off.  If there is one lesson we can all learn from this I believe it is &quot;Your morals, manners and magic are your true power in Norrath.
