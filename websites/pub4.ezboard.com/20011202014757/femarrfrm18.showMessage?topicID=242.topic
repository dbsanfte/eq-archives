Christians did it for hundreds of years. They killed Jews by the hundreds of thousands in the name of Christ. Then came the Muslims who killed Christians in droves. Yes, the Quran commands the killing of infidels such as Christians. Right?<br>

Right? <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Wrong!<br>
<br>
Well, with that out of the way, let me elaborate further.<br>
<br>
Qur'aan did not command that.<br>
<br>
See, what Islam commands its followers to do with none-muslims goes like this:<br>
<br>
1- Treat them the best way possible ( goes with this: Treat people the way you want yourself to be treated ) I'd write a lot more on this if you folks want em details.<br>
 <br>
2- Invite them to Islam. Notice, the word is not 'convert', it is 'invite'. Islam is not just a religion, it is a way of life. I want to invite you, because i believe i have something wonderful, something that i want to share with you.<br>
<br>
Invitiation is done by teaching, and by example.<br>
<br>
Islam reached the far east and africa without war, the people of those lands simpley loved how the muslim traders behaved ( total honesty, no cheating, etc).<br>
<br>
I don't know if you folks heard about this but, <br>
The rate of americans becoming muslims was about 25,000 persons each year. Now, after people actively sought muslims and books about islam to read about it, more than 100,000 americans became muslims, since the disaster at septemper 11th.<br>
<br>
So really, just go read, ask about islam, what it is. Make sure you ask a Muslim about it, because there are a lot of fake materials around.<br>
<br>
I'll be really happy to answer any quesions you have, to the best of my knowledge. <br>
<br>
About muslims killing christians. All the incidences i know of are of self defense. Most of the current fights of that nature have other causes, and Islam is certainly innocent of it. I'd be glad to discuss any facts with you <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
I respect the fact that you are Muslim. And, I will also stipulate that my drunken posting above used sweaping generalizations that are incorrect. Of course, not all Muslims are going to agree that the Quran commands the killing of Christians. But I have not only read, but talked with many Shiite Muslims who regard Christians as infidels. You certainly cannot deny that early on in Islamic history we find Muslims killing Christians (not out of self defense) in the name of Allah as found within the pages of the Quran. Well, you can deny it, but history will only prove your assertion false.<br>
<br>
Christians act with the same duplicity, &quot;We are peaceful god fearing souls&quot; but they have bloody histories and would not hesitate to kill in the name of their god if given license. You can bet they will be thumbing through their holy book and quoting it in support of their actions, just as many Muslims who support Osama bin Laden's terrorist acts did!<br>

<br>
Before we start, I'd like to say something. All i seek is to promote understanding of Islam, not to fight or to prove that i am right, or that you are wrong. So, let's discuss. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I say it again, Qur'aan most definitely does not say that muslims should/must kill christians. Now, if you say otherwise, please give some examples <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
2nd part, you talked with some 'shiite'. Those are sooo radically different from Muslims, far more than what you can imagine. Thus, what they say is not what Islam is about. I'm perfectly willing to discuss this to any length with you ( as time permits <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ), but for now, let me give a tiny example of how different shiite's are. In their  set of beliefs, killing a none-shiite muslim would get them to heaven ( as - from what you said - they feel about christians). Juggle that with the fact of islam being a religion of total peace, of social security, of family and individual ( again willing to discuss any point you have <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ), you'll see what 'shiite' is about.<br>
<br>
About the wars. I don't know, so please do give me examples to dispute what i say, if you care to follow on this subject.<br>
<br>

<br>
With due respect I do not wish to pursue this along the lines you propose. You appear to be working within a set theological point of view. A viewpoint I will not even attempt to refute, since it is futile.<br>
<br>
Let me just say that while you claim the Shiite are not Muslim, they themselves firmly believe they are and that their interpretation of the Quraan is correct. Who is actually Muslim? I don't really care, truthfully.<br>
<br>
As far as examples of war go historically I can point to the Muslim occupations of North Africa, Spain and parts of Southern Europe between 700 and 1400 CE (AD). At that time Christians either converted to Islam or faced death or were exiled from their home lands. But don't let that atrocity fool you, since Christians were doing the very same thing to Muslims! Of course, there were periods when both Christians and Muslims lived peacefully, too. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  However, to deny that Muslims don't have a bloody history just as Christians do is to ignore the facts. <br>
<br>
Again, I don't want to get into a theological debate with you. I merely state what historically is the case, which is many Muslims have quoted the Quraan in support of killing Christians (Shiite for example). Is their interpretation correct? That is something I will let Muslims fight out.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/usolathanhonorshield.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Solathan Honorshield</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 114<br> <font color=#E9D756>(11/29/01 6:12:19 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Religious Wars!</span><hr size=1> Sorry for being late again! Still very busy in rl <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I apologize if that sounded like theology, it was not meant to be. Here's what I should've said earlier:<br>
<br>
1) Shiite's are a small minority, 10-15% or less of all Muslims ( mainly Iran, east of Saudi, some in Kuwait, Bahrain, Lebanon and Syria ). What they think ( and how they try to explain Qu'raan) should not be generalized to all Muslims!<br>
<br>
Really, I don't think of any human being as an 'infidel' or hate them or such. All i wish for you is to live in peace, as you wish, as long as no one hurts any one else <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
2) Here's what i said badly, above, in another form: using logic, look at what the shiite's think and say ( from a long chat with a friend, i think that shiite's make Baptists( sp? ) look like a friendly bunch ) and compare it with what you know about Islam ( which means Peace). <br>
<br>
Here's what Islam ( from Qur'aan ) says about killing a single person:<br>
<br>
{{if anyone slew a person - unless it be for murder or for spreading mischief in the land - it would be as if he slew the whole people: and if any one saved a life, it would be as if he saved the life of the whole people }}  (Al-Maidah: 32)<br>
<br>
I hope that clarifies it a bit more <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Next, about the Religious Wars,<br>
<br>
Let me quote you:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  Muslim occupations of North Africa, Spain and parts of Southern Europe between 700 and 1400 CE (AD). At that time Christians either converted to Islam or faced death or were exiled from their home lands. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
The following is a fact: In Islam, religious freedom for EVERYBODY is totally guaranteed, as said in the following ( from Qu'raan' ):<br>
<br>
{{Let there be no compulsion in religion: Truth stands out clear from Error }}  (Al-Baqarah: 256)<br>
<br>
And this:<br>
<br>
{{ Say, &quot;The Truth is from your Lord&quot;: Let him who will, believe, and let him who will, reject (it)}}  (Al-Kahfi: 29)<br>
<br>
<br>
And lastly:<br>
<br>
{{ To you be your Way, and to me mine }}  (A-Kafirun: 6)<br>
 <br>
So yeah, no one would ever 'force' any one into becoming a muslim ( while FOLLOWING Islam), since that change of religion would be false. Mind you, i am not saying that it never happened. What I am saying is that those who did it were following their own goals, and should not be ascribed to Islam <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
The other part of what i wanted to say is about the very early Islamic wars ( most of which were REALLY for Islam and not for personal goals) . Those wars were not like the wars we know, they were truely for liberation and freedom, to bring justice to the obressed ( sp? ) populations of those regions. <br>
<br>
The biggest proof of this is: Most of those populations are STILL mainly Muslims. If you were forced into something, you'd leave it as soon as you possibly could, wouldn't you? If so, why they did not? <br>
<br>
Also, more in support with the ideas I presented earlier is the respectable % of Christians still living in those areas.<br>
<br>
Spain and south europe is another story, which i'll give more of <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  my </i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> viewpoint about if required!<br>
<br>
This is a tiny quote i am too lazy to write ( I.e. I cut and pasted it <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  )<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>
Anyone who knows the early history of Islam, will know that all those nations and empires which came under the fold of Islam were indeed previously oppressed. When the companions of the Prophet Muhammed (saws) went out for the offensive jihad against the Egyptians, the Persians and the Romans, we find that the people did not resist against them at all. Rather, they accepted Islam on such a scale, that it is inconceivable that the jihad of Islam could be anything other then a liberation for these people; a liberation from centuries of tyranny. In fact, with the Byzantine Egyptians and the people of Spain, the Muslims were even beckoned to come and liberate these lands from the oppression of their kings. <br>
<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <br>
<br>
Now, let me reinforce what i always say in such threads! I'm not preaching ( in Islam we call it 'inviting' <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ) I'm merely defending and clarifying! I do take all that is required to avoid any sort of offending. <br>
<br>
I'm willing to discuss any of those points to any length you require <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I have read it and I can tell you that Jesus does NOT call for people to kill in the name of Him, His Father, or His Spirit.  Anyone who says so is not a follower of Christ, and therefor the Bible.<br>
<br>
If I go into McDonalds and yell "I do this for MUzaak" and then open fire killing everyone... does that mean it is what you wanted?  Does that mean that I should blame you?<br>
<br>
I find it sickening when people make fun of God because of what idiots claim to do in His name.  Doesn't take a genius to pick up the Bible, read it, and say.. "nope, God had no hand in this."<br>
<br>
Oh, and Muzaak, TRUE Christians aren't perfect (nor is anyone), they are just saved people who keep trying to be perfect.  Why are we hypocrties? Because as Christians we soemtimes do things that aren't Christian like?<br>
<br>
So if you are a father you always act father-like then?  Never play a game when you should be paying a bit of attention to the kid?  If you are a brother you always act like a brother then right? Always jump to help brother/sister when they need it?  If you are a son you always act in a way to make your parents proud right?  Whatever.. you find the example.. and you tell me you aren't a hypocrite by your own definition. <p><font color=green><b>Cendan Tankenpriest</b></font color><br>

Cendan, since you claim to be an avid reader of the Bible, please tell me what god commanded should be done to Witches, homosexuals, and prostitutes? He commands to kill them. Hmmm... in fact, just read most of the old testament of the Christian scriptures again to find where god orders the genocide of entire peoples. If you want I can dig around Deuteronomy, Leviticus, Exodus and pull out some quotes?<br>
<br>
BTW, if you want to say something like &quot;Christ's act of death on the cross&quot; abolishes the law of the Old Testament then please explain why an infinitely perfect being such as god had to change his mind about the law he gave to Moses? Was he wrong? Or is the New Testament &quot;more perfect&quot; meaning god handed Moses a less than perfect set of laws? If that is the case, then god really is not an infintely perfect being... god makes mistakes. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>Lurikeen Mali'Kyre<BR>
