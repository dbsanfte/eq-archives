That is the ONLY!! way you will have any power in the american political systemby removing the ones in it atm.<br>
<br>
Look at your choices<br>
//republican/democrat/green/indepentdant?maybe a few others.But in all likliness,you will only get a republican or democrat,because it was ingrained in us for the last 50 years(or more,gotta look at when the whigs were removed) to vote for either one of those two parties.<br>
<br>
remember perot? remember what was gonna happen if he got over a certain amount of votes? it was going to be put to a vote in the senate,which at the time was republican run,which means bush senior would have won for a second term.<br>
<br>
Now,since perot realized that,and put his support to clinton and asked his supporters to vote for clinton,that supposedly cinched it for him.<br>
<br>
Does the above make sense?does it even sound like a democracy where the people are supposed to have the true voting power?<br>

<br>
The principal author of the bill, Howard Berman of California (D) is pretty much <a href=http://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/indus.asp?CID=N00008094&cycle=2002>owned</a> by the RIAA and MPAA. Click that link to see just how much cash they've been brib..err..donating to him. Californians, if he's up for reelection this fall, you can vote against this asshat.<br>
<br>
Most ISPs are pissed at this bill. It gives the MPAA and RIAA the ability to disrupt any network at will without any concern over collateral damage. Most of the backbone router mailing lists have plans to null route (make them go nowhere) MPAA/RIAA ip blocks as soon as the law is passed as a matter of principle. If someone is causing a disruption or DOS attack on the public internet,you shut them down.<br>
<br>
This bill, like the DMCA before it, totally disregards the fourth amendment right to due process by allowing the RIAA/MPAA to pretty much act as vigilantes. You're guilty until you (at your expense) prove your innocence.<br>

<br>
Now the last time I looked on the net I was under the impression that it wasn't all under American jurisdiction. Did something change? <br>
<br>
Is this guy seriously discussing the possibility of hacking other countries computers? I'd love to see how many countries would determine that this was an act of war.<br>
<br>
Either that or he's only suggesting American computers be hacked in which case everything ( including e-mail, web hosting, file servers and more just for the security of it ) will get moved to non-american servers which will mean that not only will he not have succeeded in stopping the illegal distribution of software but he'll actively reduce the IT revenue in the country too.  <p><CENTER><A HREF="http://ak.lonelygamer.com">

OMFG this isn't happening.</span><hr size=1> Interesting how politics work today.<br>
<br>
You find dozens of instances where the voters are overruled just because. You find instances where presidential candidates are put through a second vote just because they aren't R or D. You find bills that would essentially overthrow many freedoms we have had for so long.<br>
<br>
I smell 1776 all over again. And not the way our side of the Atlantic had it.<br>
<br>
For those unfamiliar with the French Revolution. It essentially was started because the richest members of French society were exempt from taxes. Without digging through sources I would be unable to discover why. Thus, only the poorest paid, and since they had to shoulder the extra burden meant to be distributed through the population. they would be paying what amounts to 70% taxes today. Also, much of the nobility was corrupt and the king was weak. Combine this with poor weather and harvests, and you got the (first) French Revolution.<br>
<br>
Enter Today. The richest members of American society are, if not exempt from taxes, so influential and rich that they might as well be politicians. Who here would vote for Bill Gates in the Senate? We vote for people who have a clue, even if they aren't necessarly the best choice. Senators are involved with scandals, and are so often bribed (err, given donations) that they are totally corrupt in many cases. Those that aren't are overruled by the better-paid majority. The president won the election by such a tiny margin. He only holds power (read: big opinion incoming!) because of the war on terrorism. Taxes are low, but the tax on freedom and privacy is high. Companies like Enron (run by the highest ranking members of society, akin to nobility) are exempt from such inquisitions until something big happens.<br>
<br>
So, we have a corrupt nobility and weak central monarch/president. Instead of complaining about taxes, we have extra burdens on our freedoms. Interesting; in the 18th century it was money problems, while security was high, 21st century it's privacy problems while money is a smaller issue...<br>
<br>
Does anyone else see the possibility?<br>
<br>
There is an issue at hand. The standard of living is high. Our basic needs are taken care of, not something your average Frenchman under Louis XVI could claim. Thus, people are complacent. I am one to truly believe that power resides in the lower class masses. Right now they are asleep. Should something happen to give your blue-collar workers reason to rise up, only then would we undergo a huge change.<br>
<br>
But where does most of the focus lie? The white collar worker who has time to complain that his computer is no longer safe. A worker in a steel mill likely doesn't even have a computer at home. France underwent a blue-collar rvolution; today it would be a white-collar revolution. Instead of bearing pitchforks and rifles and storming the Bastille, we would bear lawsuits and legal contracts and storm the internet. And thus lies the problem.<br>
<br>
Today, a revolution would never be successful. To have a totally successful revolution against a totally corrupt government (which we aren't far from) you need military might. And the army is firmly in the governments pocket. They are paid, housed, and employed by the government. In 18th century France, a standing army was not always in place, which means that they lived as civilians and had the same problems as anyone else. However, if it came down to the military being called in to stop people from rising up, it would only prove the corruption of the goverenment. Thus, we would be a regime.<br>
<br>

Note that all of the above is hypothetical, and very unlikely. But the signs are there. Hopefully someone will heed them.<br>

- If you are living in a socialist country, good for you. Maybe you like it. Americans do not. So, we are not. Are we wrong? Last time I check the US was the most powerful country in the world. Thus, we have to be doing something right. You probably don't like that statement. We don't care.<br>
<br>
- If the law does not fail, programmers will simply start using encryption. (Easy these days.) You can't block what you cannot see. RIAA wants to basicly TCP SYN flood suspecting systems. (Same attack they suffered over the weekend.) There is currently no way to protect a site from this other than refusing traffic from that IP or network. (With current technology.) I imagine this will be built into things like Kazaa as well. Just a simple IDS daemon that will detect and block. *Side Note* TCP SYN only really works against <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="HTTP..."></a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--> file sharing is not done through port 80. Bottom line... there is always someone smarter than you, and they probably do not work at RIAA. However, I do not see the bill passing anyway.<br>

OMFG this isn't happening.</span><hr size=1> Just a view from a different slant, but very similar.  I don't really have a stand one way or the other at the moment, but here are some of my random thoughts. <br>
<br>
Joe User has his spiffy new cable modem connected computer, loads up some internet file sharing application ( a la Napster ), and doesn't ever bother to patch or secure his system (or home network for that matter).<br>
<br>
Now, lets say that the RIAA gets this law passed and they can sniff into home users looking for illeagal recordings.  Lets also assume that Joe User's machine was hacked at some point by a worm or virus (I see this all the time).  I as an administrator of a network, notice that Joe's computer is flooding my network trying to propagate it's worm.<br>
<br>
Now that the RIAA has set a precident, do you think that I could go hack Joe's computer and shut it down?  After all, it's almost the same thing.  His computer flooding my network with traffic is impeding my company's ability to turn a profit, just as Joe having illegal recordings on his PC impedes the recording industry from turning a profit.<br>
<br>
Lets take it one more way, lets say that the RIAA Syn floods Joe to prevent him from sharing, but that same Syn flood prevents Joe from reaching our website to purchase our product.  Can we then go after the RIAA for loss of business?<br>
<br>
Anyones thoughts on this? <p><B>Festivus Metalpole</B><BR>

be in 7-10-20 years.. Thats a bad way of passing a new<br>
branch of government. Or any law. How can they be so stupid to think the world will never continue to change.<br>
<br>
Getting back on track here, What the real issue here is<br>
not people pirating software. It is that our government is<br>
stepping in and giving Big business more power then<br>
they themselves have. &quot;That can, And will backfire&quot;..<br>
<br>
By doing this the Government does not have to be held<br>
accountable for these infringments of our personal security.. Accept they will be.. And Hard.<br>
<br>
But with the new Homeland security they can hardline<br>
any retaliation into a percieved Terrorist act. *Now they call that terrorism*<br>
<br>
Even now if you threaten someone they call it a Terrorist Threat. BAH !! Punch-um in the nose !<br>
<br>
And if you think it will stop there. Guess again.<br>
the whole aggression that is coming about these day's <br>
post 9/11 aer for a reason. And like FDR did with <br>
American prisoners of war, &quot;having them stay prisoners for support on the war with Japan&quot; Our government now <br>
is placing their new stratagys. It's all about Money, Power. Not our personal security from terrorists.<br>
Think Oil..<br>

I doubt most Americans could name even a few basic tenets of socialism off the top of their head. Most I've spoken to believe it's another word for communsim. I really believe if you had the choice, which you don't and probably never will, you'd like a lot of the concepts of socialism. The ruling class of the US aren't going to give you that chance in Hell.<br>

America the most powerful nation on Earth? Sure, but the stronger something gets, the more brittle it becomes. Diamond is the hardest naturally occuring mineral known, but if struck along a certain cleavage plane, it shatters easily.<br>

<br>
well no....we've been fighting against communism...or so the theory goes.  although there are many reasons for the cold war and the vietnam war that run far deeper than simply fighting communists, most of that built up fear of communists in american minds was propoganda to get them to accept the wars and hate the enemy.  the countries we &quot;fought&quot; in these wars were communists though not socialists.  of course they have similar ideas, but they are not the same thing.  <br>
<br>
america wanted to stamp out communism because it posed a threat to american power.  it was a rising form of government that was &quot;spreading&quot; across the world.  the soviets backed up castro in order for him to take over cuba so they could have an ally that was close enough to bomb the us.  we were minutes away from being nuked which has been called &quot;the cuban missle crisis.&quot;  castro actually didn't have bad ideals for his country, he won cuba via a revolution and he was a much better ruler than his predecessor.  what he did that pissed off so many americans was take over all the american run businesses in cuba.  most of them were run by the mafia including their booming casinos.  the mafia lost billions of $$ from this and thus (my personal theory) assassinated jfk because he did not support the anti-castro cubans in the &quot;bay of pig&quot; incident with air support.  we could have owned cuba if jfk chose to get americans involved that day.<br>
<br>
we feared russia and the soviets because they are a very powerful empire.  hitler new it, he allied with them, and then backstabbed them.  the soviets tried very hard to &quot;recruit&quot; other countries to communism.<br>
<br>
then comes vietnam.  vietnam had been had been colonized by the french for centuries.  the french were broke after WWII and were fighting civil battles in algeria and vietnam after WWII because the people of those countries decided to get back their country after the french had enslaved them for centuries.  the french were very vulnerable and eventually agreed to move out of vietnam.  they move out, US moves in.  why did the US move in?  because the north vietnam where the takeback had occurred was communist.  the south was still under a french democracy and the US took advantage of that and moved in thinking they could conquer the north.  blah blah blah we all know what happened with that.<br>
<br>
my point is that we've fought against communism because we fear it's potential power.  communism however poses very little threat to us today and the actions of the government to attempt and &quot;control&quot; our private lives or at least spy on us really has nothing to do with socialism or communism.  it is the basis of the democratic party, more governmental control on private lives.  of course the republicans seem to be more successful at &quot;controlling&quot; us.  the reason for this new urgency for invasion of privacy is due to september 11.  the government knew who the terrorists were before it happened, but they didn't have enough evidence to make any sort of arrest legally.  they had to wait for these guys to make an aggressive act or make a big mistake...well we all know what happened.  being able to legally invade on these people's &quot;personal rights&quot; could potentially save the future of this country.  i'm not supportive of invasion of privacy, but if it means being protected then so be it, i have nothing personally to hide.  i understand the principle of what people do not like about it, but sometimes you have to sacrafice a little bit of freedom in order to insure your security.<br>
<br>

Yes, that's revolutionary talk, and I can't wait for the day that this BS gets over thrown. I'm not an anarchist, I just believe our arrogance and corruption needs to stop. Sorry, IMO, if Bush wants to make a tax cut, he should cut it from his paycheck, and from the congress' paycheck.<br>

Oh yeah, and my replys to others...<br>
<br>
Okay first off, fact: Over 50% of the total tax revenue of the United States is paid by the upper 5% of people, in other words, any family or person with an income over $100,000 (not a lot of money with a big family and tight taxes.)  Contrastingly, the lower 50% of the spectrum, pays less than 5% of the United States total tax revenue.  If your bitchin about taxation of the poor, get off your fvcking soap box.<br>

America is not a democracy, its a democratic republic... big diference if you understand governments.<br>

Until we are able to all align, under one *bad word to use here* internationally elected government, we're all going to have totally different problems. <br>

laws to be the way they see it. IE Crazy !<br>

DAMN.<br>

you hear the news.. The news is only 10% of the <br>

the truth till they are out of office..<br>
