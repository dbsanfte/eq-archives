Although these letters are a story that that my in-game brother, Falorius, and I threw together a while back, this is my first post on this board. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Hope you like it.]<br>
<br>
&quot;My dear brother -- <br>
<br>
The Ministry of Fear is infiltrating this continent as quickly as can be expected, given the fact that only a few of us have taken it upon ourselves to leave Paineel. I find it surprising, almost delightful, how willing these pale-faced citizens of Antonica are to listen to our thoughts and theories when their lives are in my hands. Perhaps it is the impending nature of Death that strikes them so. In conversations I have had with some of those for whom I care, they confess that, in the moments when their lifeblood is nearly drained, their minds are the most active. They realize where in the course of battle their mistake were made. My brother, they learn of the preserving and immediate nature of Fear. To these I say that a valorous and powerful soul is not one who marches into battle with the smugness of a lion at the head of his pride, but one who is terrified at the possibility of Death and continues to fight. And they understand, Falorius. Their eyes gleam with a hunger for the knowledge of the uses of Fear. The idea is planted into their minds; the thought shall spread across slowly, though -- it shall be a subtle contagion.<br>
<br>
Of course, there are those who view battle as a casual way to pass an evening. I would just as soon spit on their feet as heal them, if I thought that it would not be a waste of my saliva. The inevitable pain of Death shall claim them soon enough.<br>
<br>
Yet, after witnessing such haughtiness, I must implore you, Falorius, to temper your own pride while you are still young. Mocking the pale skins, attempting to dethrone their gods with your fiery words -- while your fervency is admirable, I would not, nay, I WILL not see my brother, my own blood, disgraced by seasoned paladins and proud clerics of the lighter forces, who would call you a pup trying to play in older mongrels' games. Our time will come; hone your blade before your tongue.<br>
<br>
I also beg you to step out from the shadows in which you skulk and come to meet my companion of late, Ealelis. Though he is not of our own land, his skills as a mage are commendable and his own dark fury almost fascinating to observe. Unlike many Teir'dal, he is agnostic; his burning desire for change stems not from his allegiance to Innoruuk but from the dark legacy that is Teir'dal heritage. He might have been a reckless force, but he is amenable to our cause; Cazic-Thule favors him. With a bit of patience, and perhaps some close, special attention, he will make a wonderful tool.<br>
<br>
I send with this letter a bottle of fine red wine purchased from the gypsies that camp in the plains of Karana. Though I have not partaken in it myself, Ealelis's outstanding intelligence has lent to his connoisseurship of wine, and this comes with his highest recommendation. May its sweetness curb your bitter hate, at least until our time of triumph comes.<br>
<br>
In night's embrace,<br>
Atien&quot;<br>
<br>
Atien leaned back in her chair and ran the feathery end of her quill across her cheek. Yes, this would satisfy Falorius's curiosity as to her whereabouts in months past. She brought the cup of tea to her lips and stared out the window of her room at the jagged peaks of Highkeep, bathed in the still blue of midnight.<br>
<br>
She felt another sensation cross her cheek, barely distinguishable from the brush of her quill.<br>
<br>
&quot;My mistress, you must rest from your work at some point. Even the gods sit and wait.&quot;<br>
<br>
Atien raised her head and glared into Ealelis's eyes with a look worthy of cold marble. &quot;Would you dare disrupt me now, my companion?&quot; she whispered.<br>
<br>
A smile curled across the Teir'dal's mouth. &quot;Ah, not if I did not believe that you could use some welcome amusement,&quot; he purred as he gestured to the goblin gagged and rope-bound on the floor behind him.<br>
<br>
Atien's stare melted into a gaze of approval. &quot;You know me well, my love.&quot; She turned her eyes away from Luclin's slow, subtle glow and regarded the goblin writhing in terror a few feet away.<br>
<br>
&quot;Show him the true meaning of Fear, my beloved,&quot; she cooed.<br>
<br>

<br>
&quot;My dear sister --<br>
<br>
Our time apart has made you weak. When will you see that knowledge will never come to those around you? You walk amongst and converse with these fools as if they were our equals, which they most certainly are not. I had thought I trained you better dear sister. Very kind of you to thrust my failure upon me as ypu have done. <br>
<br>
A tiger cub was born of the unity between a mighty tiger and tigress. One day while out playing, the cub witnessed a powerful dragon laying waste to an entire kingdom. The cub watched with awe as the majestic dragon reduced a once proud nation into a pile a cinder and ash. At that point he vowed that he would be that strong one day. He would not merely become like a dragon... he would become a dragon. He spent his days emulating the actions of a dragon, practicing his roars. On a a sunny afternoon, the cub thought it would be a nice day to attempt flight. The cub approached a chasm and, with confidence jumped. In his mind, he became a dragon. Do you know what heppened next my dear sister? He fell... and was impaled amongst the jagged rocks below. Perhaps, at this point you are wondering what the point of my tale is. If that be the case, then your time spent with these fools has truly dulled your wits. A tiger can never be more than what he is. Despite his training and discipline, he will never match the glory or power of a dragon. Your Tier'dal suitor will never be more than what he is.<br>
<br>
I do not wish for this to be taken the wrong way sister. Although I have never met him, I do not blame your Tier'dal lover. By choosing you, he acknowledges that there are none within his kind that are worthy. No, he is not at fault. It is you that I blame. A Teir'dal cannot help being born a Teir'dal, much in the same a way tiger cannot help being born a tiger. You however, have made a CHOICE to be with him and I cannot forgive that.<br>
<br>
My last act as your brother is to wish you well and that you find happiness with your suitor, though I know that will not happen. Much in the same way that I would never find happiness while wed to and orc.<br>
<br>
I have no use for a Tier'dal, and now I no longer have use for a sister. From this point forward, I no longer bear the burden of treacherous sister. If ever you find yourself in need, then run to weak ones you call friends. I'll have nothing to do with you.<br>
<br>
Farewell,<br>
Falorius&quot;<br>
<br>
Falorius returns the quill to the nearly empty ink well. He glances over to the unopened bottle of gypsy wine that now rests in his hand. His grip tightens around the neck of the bottle as he twists the cap open.<br>
<br>
&quot;A bottle of wine, my dear former sister? I unlike you, am not so easily bought.&quot;<br>
<br>
With that, Falorius turns away and pours the contents of bottle upon the cold stone floor. <br>
<br>
&quot;May our paths never cross. For when next we meet, it will be your blood spilled and not wine.&quot;<br>

<br>
I had never before thought that I should see the product of the mating of an ogre with an Erudite, and yet, upon reading your letter, I should say that I can imagine no other explanation as to the presence of such a dull mind within a nobly etched shell.<br>
<br>
Must I remind you of our mission? We were among the first to leave Paineel, sent to this wretched world of pale-face make to inspire Fear among these disgusting beings, to find those who would work for us as we reclaim our former glory. Would you isolate yourself and crawl among the sewers of Antonica, recruiting sewer rats to Cazic-Thule's cause? Would you not seek out the treasures of knowledge that lie scattered about Norrath's marred face? If so, then why not return to Paineel? There will be plenty of fire beetles on which you may practice with your blade, and the spirit chanters have an eternity with which to listen to your endless prattling.<br>
<br>
Ealelis has been consecrated unto me by Cazic-Thule himself. Our Lord of Fear has, through my hands, bestowed his favor upon him. His desire for knowledge and power is strong, almost worthy of an Erudite. Do you still possess such a drive, numb one? Through him, I have learned secrets of the mage's trade to which none other of the Heretics have privilege. Though his thirst be dangerous, he is bound to me in blood, in favor, and soon, in sacred oath. He pleases me and serves me; he will not survive the wrath of Cazic-Thule should he fail to do so.<br>
<br>
Falorius, you are like too many of Erudin with regard to your blade. It is your obsession; once you became skilled with it, you considered it your life and forgot that it was simply a tool with which to achieve a greater goal. Now, you quest for blood instead of knowledge. Do you also forget our heritage? Our fathers and mothers found the haughty slime of Erudin because they had stumbled across the potent new knowledge of necromancy. Therefore, fight if you so wish, and seperate yourself from the rest of Norrath; be a soldier. But if you do so, you not only sever your bond to your sister, the last remaining of your kin. You fail in your quest for knowledge and brand yourself a traitor to the goals of all of Paineel's citizens.<br>
<br>
Throw away this letter if you wish; I have made my peace. Burn it and send the ashes dancing on Ro's breath. Do so, and know that your sister likewise denies you.<br>
<br>
And pray to our God, that which we share, that you never encounter my wrath. No, your blood shall not be spilt by me, nor shall your mortal frame be wounded.<br>
<br>
Souls, in their eternity of damnation and torment, have no need to spill blood.<br>
<br>
In death's embrace,<br>
Atien&quot;<br>
<br>
The messenger lay trembling next to the fire, his wrists and ankles bound by rough ropes. Atien leaned over and probed the gaping wound that festered on the man's bare chest.<br>
<br>
&quot;I thank you for your patience, sir,&quot; Atien mumbled as the man whimpered. &quot;It is not my will that you must service me in this manner, but you are needed for this most important task.&quot; She dipped the sharp point of her quill into the fleshy pool, thoroughly saturating it with the messenger's blood.<br>
His pupils flared.<br>
<br>
Atien applied a pungent balm to the chest wound and affixed her signature glyph to the bottom of the parchment. She then whispered words of healing while holding her hand above the messenger's chest, effectively stitching his flesh together. <br>
<br>
&quot;Is there any more pain?&quot; she asked quietly. The man shook his head, his eyes still wide with terror.<br>
<br>
&quot;Good. The mission you have is a difficult one, as you have already seen. But it must be done. Failure, dear messenger, carries with it a price worse than success.&quot; Atien's hands began to glow with an otherworldy hue. &quot;Do you understand?&quot;<br>
<br>
The messenger nodded.<br>
<br>
&quot;Very good, young one. Now take this.&quot; She rolled up the letter and sealed it with a stamp of melted wax before placing it in a bag filled muffins, milk and several pieces of platinum. &quot;This is your last task from me. I do not want to see you again unless you are kneeling before my god in worship. Bring the letter to the one who sent you here, wherever he is. I will know if he does not receive it.&quot; She stared at the smooth stretch of his chest which had minutes before born a grave wound. &quot;All else in here is compensation for your time and discomfort, for which I am greatly sorry.&quot;<br>
<br>
Atien took a knife from her boot and cut the binding ropes that held him before her. Not even a second had passed before he had snatched up the pack and started on his long trip, already running.<br>
