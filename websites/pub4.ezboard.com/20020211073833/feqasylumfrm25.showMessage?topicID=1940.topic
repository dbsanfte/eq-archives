I have contacted Jittan (who posted a Naggy the day before this then honourably withdrew his raid) and he has agreed to take it over.  I'll leave this post here until I get details from him as to how he wants to handle the posts.  Please still go and support him though, for above all, Naggy must die.  Oh, and a nice caster item and the CoF WILL drop :)<br><br>---<br>Hi all. I will be organising a raid on Lord Nagafen on <br><br>Friday 15/Feb/2002 at 1730 PST <br>Sat 16/2/02 1230 Sydney time <br><br>I am after the red scale for my [bard] epic, however with this Naggy raid there is no loot defaulted (NBG of course), therefore I will roll with the rest of the angry mob. <br><br>PLEASE NOTE - It is frustrating to see the spam that happens after an epic battle with a dragon such as this. Some nice things WILL drop, and some people will end up with some ubber gear, most of us will not. However one thing is for certain, we cannot do it without several groups so please come - but come with the intention of having an epic battle, adventure and some satsifying fun. If you win, then walk away with some REALLY nice stuff.<br><br>The Lavastorm rings are the best place to meet, time being 1730 US PST. Depending on who shows up we will need a minimum of 20 people, up to however many wish to join (I don't particularly like closed raids, however if too many wish to come it will just get messy).<br><br>---<br>Required classes<br><br>A stack of peridots will be given to clerics/chanters (jaspers if pre 44) before the fight.<br><br>We will need lots of clerics.  The main thing to slow such raids down is looking for necessary classes.  In this case it is clerics who are often short.  If you know any clerics 40-52 please consider asking them to sign up and come along so we don't have to spend prescious time on the day doing same.<br><br>Would like a monk or FD puller who is experienced pulling FG's.  Jackii did a wonderful job last time, so if you are available please advise.  We will still need a sub 53 monk to pull the lair in conjunction with Jackii.<br><br>---<br>53+<br>If you are 53+ and are interested then you will be most welcome at the FG's, however you will not be allowed to roll on any Naggy items (unless you help cohost).  The exception is an epic able cleric who will be allowed to roll with all the other clerics on items.<br><br>Otherwise the soft level requirements are 45 to 52 (40+ healers). High fire and magic resists are necessary. +80 unbuffed for both is optimal, however you can get away with less depending on the group makeup and your level. If you are struggling with resists then speak to a kind shammy and get hold of some greater Null and cold potions to give you that extra +25 resist (costs around 45p each shot. If you will have such potions for sale on the day please indicate here).<br><br>If you are one of those big fat ugly ogres/trolls then see if you can organise yourself a shrink, it is bad enough having to look at you at all, let alone as large as life :)    <br><br>---<br>Temp groups will be formed at the rings  (groups may change for actual meeting with Naggy) we will make our way according to the linked map<br><br>(copy and paste this first link)<br>http://www25.brinkster.com/victusfortis/images/nagafenslair.gif<br><br>Thanks to muse at <br>http://www.eqatlas.com/<br>for the initial map that I scribbled on, which is located here<br>http://www.eqatlas.com/nagafenslairmap.html<br><br>I would like to have 1 group "camping" the line from zone to lava to keep it free of critters and to guide others who don't know the way.  If you are familiar with that area please indicate so.<br><br>At the reassemble point "the lava" (see map) we will stop and make sure all members are present. You will need lev to run over the lava past this point. A scout with FD will run ahead to check if clear and we will fight at the next stop. After clearing the area we can make a way through as per the map.<br><br>You can buy FR +5 earrings at the gypsies in LS just south of the rings for around 26p each.<br><br>On the day I will designate crowd controllers for the FG's. They cannot be mezzed, however they can be charmed. Those that can charm will get the first adds, any additional adds should be agroed by a hybrid with root and taken away from the fight and rooted there. This may not work as planned, but is the intention. (Anyone had trouble rooting them?).<br><br>If you can bind yourself in the lair and don't mind doing so, then please bind at the spot located on the map. Make sure that you don't bind in the agro range of any FG's in case you have LD problems on the day and cannot come back in time, or alternatively you forget to rebind yourself outside hehehe. I know you have all forgotten to do so at some remote time in your glorious pasts :)    <br><br>It is intended that, depending on numbers only standard fighting buffs from within your group will be carried out at the LS rings. Real buffs will happen at the buffing point inside.<br><br>---<br>Buffs<br>Because there is likely to be a lot of people, you will prolly have to organise your own buffs THROUGH your group leader.  People will be assigned to do GMR, HB, haste and shammy buffs.  There should be a fake buffer in every group.<br><br>It is up to you to ORGANISE YOUR OWN FAKE BUFFS when the call is given to start fake buffing.  If the fake buff starts to drop, then ask again.  It is important that everyone helps out here as this process can take way too long.<br><br>Depending on numbers this is how buffing should work.  Ideally 4 fake buffs would be good (for he mass dispells) in the following order -<br>1 - see invis (longer lasting buff would be better, please suggest)<br>2- resist disease<br>3- resist poison<br>4- resist cold<br><br>However depending on how many turn up we may not need to worry about having too many fakes up, coz they take time to cast.<br><br>Shammies, druids, hybrids and lower level clerics can do these.<br><br>with fakes up dispelling should not be an issue unless we only have a small number of people. HOwever if you have a bard in your group and you get dispelled too many times (you lose all your fakes) make sure you click off the flashing bard buffs so that next time they cycle (up to 12 seconds later prolly) they fill the first spot and get dispelled recast each tiem. You can also call for another fake from your group. This is why I have suggested an order for fakes, so that person can keep up that one fake (eg see invis) and cast when needed.<br><br>Next mellee steroids and brain buffs, then HP buffs then resist buffs.<br><br>HP buffs should include cleric HB or similar, symbol and AC and also the 2 shammy buffs. Please don't ask for more buffs than you need, coz it will only make the raid take longer. Also keep in mind that you need those MR/FR buffs, so keep enough slots open for them.<br><br>Lastly resistance buffs. These include<br>Resist magic (hopefully chanter GMR)<br>Greater Null potion (shammy made resist mag potion +25)<br>Resist Fire (or better still circle of winter if we can convince a nice very high level druid to help out).<br>Resist fire potion (shammy)<br>Mage fire DS (which will include FR component as well).<br>Bard songs which up Mag/FR and also Mag resist.<br><br>Shammies and clerics are under lots of mana pressure during buffs so for shammy would like a standby healer so shammy can cannibalise. A twitch would be good too if we are lucky enough to have a necro along.<br><br>Necros please steer clear of the cool "change to skellie form" spell as it can make life difficult in these intense times. (Come on, we know you are itching to solo him, just give us a break :)    .<br><br>Make sure you stay by your group leader in one area so you are easy to find. This is really important, yet .......<br><br>Don't let naggy fall into lava or press against wall. If this happens a command will be given to move back to original fighting area, please do so quickly.<br><br>You will need levitation to get over the lava area as indicated on the map. This will be cast either at LS rings or reassembly point. Please make sure you have a lev. Talk to your group leader if you don't.<br><br>Don't move ahead of person designated as "person not to move ahead of"<br><br>If you have complaints/suggestions whilst on the raid send tell to me (Lunitune) or the coleader . There are always ways to do it better, but we may already be committed to a particular way.  Please refrain from whinging in shouts and oocs as it just makes for a negative and unpleasant atmosphere.<br><br>Healers heal from around the corner at the Assemble point. This way you avoid the AoE blasts (until you get summoned :)    .<br><br>If you have the new agro management spells from Luclin (chanters) please be prepared to use them.  With this spell you should be able to Tash naggy fairly early on without facing instant death.<br><br>Naggy fears, so please turn off run before we start to attack him.  I am not sure whether you run away or not, for the odd occasion I have been feared I stayed in one spot.  Yet I see others run off.  Anyone got a definitive answer to this connundrum?  Anyone read this far :?<br><br>This post will be updated regularly so please visit regularly if you are interested. I will make sure Naggy is up the day before and also a couple of hours before, and will indicate here if the raid has to be postponed. In the absence of a notice of postponement here, please assume the raid will go ahead.<br><br>If you are interested and can possibly make it, please note it here, even if tentative. Equally importantly, if you have to withdraw (which happens to the best of us) please indicate so here. The more we know here on the drawing board, the faster and smoother the raid will be.<br><br>---<br>LOOT<br>NAGGY LOOT (Unfinished)<br>If you already have the item please be honest and don't ask to roll on it. If you have a similar item and would like to upgrade, I think everyone at the raid would appreciate it if you offered your old item up for grabs. This is not expected though.<br><br>Treasure Hunter's Satchel 100% weight reduction bag (all/all) this pains me greatly to do this with such a nice item, but I feel it should go to the monks only.<br>Red scale Bard/War epic so only they can roll. After much thought I have decided not to add a second roll to lev 52's. This is because the red scale can be found from many sources post 52, and with alt adv points enabled at 51 via Luclin, one can if one chooses not level past 52 without losing out. <br>Selo's drums of the march (bard only)<br>Gaunts of fiery might (mellee types only including hybrids)<br>Coat of flames (mellee types only including hybrids)<br>Heirophant's crook (druid only)<br>Bladestopper (mellees)<br>Blight, Hammer of the Scourge (shammies only)<br>Red Dragon Tooth (all/all) may not drop anymore. I am thinking that as it summons a necro pet, perhaps necros need not have one.<br>Gold Plated Koshigatana (those that can use)<br>Orb of Tishan (very nice item - those that can use)<br>Prayers of Life (all/all)<br>Book of scale (pally epic)?<br><br>All paladins who wish to roll on the book and who do not already have one will be given a number before the fight.  If the book drops a roll for them will be done immediately and the winner rezzed if necessary.  <br><br>Preliminary interest will be taken on as many items as possible whilst rezzes are happening.  The roll will NOT take place though until after everyone is rezzed.  Please only send a tell once to say you are interested in an item.<br><br>eg - Naggy down, 15 raid members down - prelim interest taken on Coat of Flames.  Those that know about it send one tell.  Once everyone rezzed, everyone else will be able to send a tell regarding interest.  Please do NOT resend your tell.<br><br>A shout will be made regarding the item and each person will be listed with their number.  NOW is the time to send another tell if your name is not listed.<br><br>Also, be prepared to have a couple of items going at once.  If I can get others to help, several items may be rolled for at the same time.  In this case send the tell to the appropriate person (one item will be rolled by each loot person) stating which item you need.  Again, please send only one tell until it is clear that your name has not been listed with a number.<br><br>---<br>Signed up already<br>WAR<br>Waraman 52 war<br>Thydean 51 war<br>Loneless 52 war<br>Bjarki 46 war<br>Dijalin 52 war<br>Aasa 52 war<br>Briorn 51 war<br><br>BARD<br>Anjulie 52 bard<br><br>CLERIC<br>CHANTER<br>ROGUE<br>Jenpa Ranma/Skarfaice  50 rog<br><br>WIZ<br>MONK<br>Deliria 52 monk<br>Cazzinia 52 Monk<br>Aenan 51 monk<br>Jjet 48 monk<br><br>DRUID<br>PALADIN<br>Nelaf 46 pally<br><br>MAGE<br>RANGER<br>BEASTY<br>SHAMMY<br>NECRO<br>SK<br>Abzsu 52 SK<br><br><br>---<br>PLEASE NOTE<br>If you wish to roll on any of the nice items that drop, <br><br>PLEASE BRING 100pp IN CASE YOU WIN.<br><br>If you win a nice item like coat of flames or red scale please be prepared to help cover the loss by the raid hosts.<br><br>That is, these raids are costing me a packet and I am not defaulting any loot to myself.  The cash items that drop don't make up for the costs (and I am never given all of the plat/cash items anyway). <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ulunitune.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lunitune</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.fbe.unsw.edu.au/staff/graham.hannah/eq/resources/lunitune60x60.jpg" BORDER=0> at: 2/9/02 7:45:13 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ulunitune.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lunitune</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.fbe.unsw.edu.au/staff/graham.hannah/eq/resources/lunitune60x60.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t d00d!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(1/29/02 11:23:39 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumfrm25.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1940.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.fbe.unsw.edu.au/staff/graham.hannah/eq/resources/lunitune60x60.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Naggy Feb 15 1730 PST [edit 0]</span><hr size=1> Please note the 100pp rule above, and please ask your healer friends ahead of time.<br><br>Jackii might you be available to pull FG's for us?
