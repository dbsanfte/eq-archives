This is a rough draft of a chapter of an actual book which I am submitting to an agent. I would appreciate any comments and feedback either here or at avii@usa.com.)<br><br>Guardian of the Fist ((c) 2000)<br><br>I snuggled into the soft fur of my bed cover, warm and cozy at last. The feathers of the mattress and pillow had no pointy quills to disturb my rest. Wind howled past the shuttered window, but safe in my father's keep, the sound was no more disturbing than a tea kettle's song. I felt a gentle thump at my feet, and I debated putting an arm out of the fur to caress my old cat. No sooner had the inner conversation begun but the cat solved the dilemma by burrowing under the extra pillow, leaving only her tail wrapped around my neck. All was indeed bliss, and I vowed to nevermore leave the sanctuary of my father's boundaries.  Closing my eyes, I turned to sleep, content.<br><br>I was drifting into slumber when I noticed the pebble underneath my hip. I shifted my weight, and it seemed to grow into a stone. I reached to move it away, inadvertently disturbing my poor cat, and she punished me by tightening her rough tail about my throat. A sharp quill poked free from the velvet pillow cover, scratching my cheek. The wind picked up speed and force, whipping my ragged fur cloak into a wild dance. My wrists began to burn, and I could not move them apart. I realized then that I was embroiled in an evil dream, and instantly I thought Arion, Arion will wake me… I opened my lips for a scream that would bring the whole keep running. <br><br>Choking on the wet leaves and muck I had nearly swallowed, I opened my eyes. <br><br>&quot;Ah, the human whore awakens.&quot; The speaker wore leather leggings, much repaired. Good boots, with intricate designs cut into the top of the boot. They looked familiar to me, somehow, and I tried to rise to my knees in an attempt to see more of my captor beyond his feet to his shins. My wrists and neck instantly cried out with the agony of raw flesh as I came to the realization that someone else besides the speaker was there. Someone powerful, as I was yanked high into the air by my neck, and then kicked into a more abject posture. My bare ankle met a large rock with a sickening crack, and I remembered where I had seen the boots before.  I was rapidly becoming concerned for my prospects.<br><br>The speaker chuckled softly. &quot;Ah, Marcus, I do believe we have found our fountain of plenty. What would she be worth?&quot;<br><br>&quot;In ransom or in slave price?&quot; came a rumbling behind me.  I tried not to shriek as my oozing skin was further punished by the rough hemp rope. I rose into the air, this time slowly. I dangled there, staring at my tormentor. An enormous head, with jutting side teeth like tusks. Green pus ran from an open wound at his temple, which he picked at with the hand not occupied with myself. The festering sore didn't seem to bother him as much as the itch on his posterior, which he scraped every few seconds. Tiny red eyes stared at me balefully. Easily twice my height and three times my width, with a smell like rotten meat and the gates of hell, this Marcus was far from his home. Ogres never wandered this far north…<br><br>With a bone rattling thud, I landed at the feet of the first speaker. The studded toe of my own boot sank into my gut as he pushed me closer to the muddy ditch beside the path. Marcus continued to scratch himself as he gathered his thoughts.<br><br>&quot;Her clothes are fine. She might be a rich man's child, or a powerful man's slut. I say we ransom her, Morell.&quot; The ogre spoke slowly, and he sat down with a thump after his enormous expenditure of thought. I noted with sorrow that his mental exhaustion was not enough to make him drop the rope that leashed us together.<br><br>Morell sighed with impatience. &quot;Fool. Even were it not for the tunic, which clearly identifies her as more than a common tramp, we have not the time. We need the money now, else we will not be prepared to join Delain's forces.&quot; He began to pace, obviously torn between a goodly price immediately and a richer purse with more patience. I hoped he would remain distracted as I slowed my breathing, willing the blood in my veins to stagnate and cool.<br><br>The blow from a gauntleted fist broke my illusion. The steel spikes on Morell's gloved fingers dug cruelly into my shoulders as he lifted me. I got my first look at his face then. His eyes glowed with an otherworldly green. His white hair was immaculate, despite the storm so recently past us. A strange heat emanated from his flesh, which had a faint tinge of blue. The wind blew a lock of his hair back, revealing a pointed ear that twitched with barely repressed fury. My mind reeled, for his strength was at odds with my knowledge of his race. I looked further, and saw the faint hint of stubble that marred his chin, and then I knew him. A half elf. The strength and height of a man with the cunning of a drow. I was in more trouble than I had realized.<br><br>&quot;Do you think me as feebleminded as my pungent friend? I saw the insignia on your uniform even before I had you captured. Your methods will not work on me, you piece of refuse,&quot; he hissed. &quot;Perhaps playing dead works on beasts and morons, but not I.&quot;<br><br>Again I hit the ground. I was beginning to wish they'd think of some new way to prove their power over me. Listening to the ogre's snicker, I had a feeling he was not yet bored of watching me bounce. Glancing at his malevolent face, I had a stronger feeling he would prefer to see me splatter.<br><br>Morell sighed. &quot;As much as it pains me to admit it, Marcus, you may almost have a point. Wash her. We shall take her to her guildhall, and if they do not wish to pay our price, we shall sell her at the Eastern slave market on our way to the rendezvous point.&quot;<br><br>Without ceremony I was flipped over the ogre's shoulder. My face was mashed against the hairy flesh, and my eyes started to roll back in their sockets from the smell. Morell, following close behind, slapped me into full conciousness. &quot;No, no, wretched creature. You'll need to dress yourself after your bath. Ogre fingers are too clumsy, and I will not befoul myself by touching you.&quot;<br><br>Marcus grunted, and for a brief moment the ground became the sky. Then icy water cramped my abused muscles, and I fought for air. My bound hands were of no use, and I choked. As I began to drown, my arms were nearly yanked from their sockets as the ogre towed me to land. <br><br>&quot;She's clean,&quot; the ogre laughed as he set me on a boulder.  He cut the ropes that restricted my movements, and picked up a chunk of stone. His meaning was clear - I had better not attempt escape if I wanted my brains intact. <br><br>A wet leather satchel nearly knocked me from my perch. &quot;Dress yourself,&quot; sneered Morell. &quot;Leave off the helmet for now. And hurry it up.&quot;<br><br>I recognized my own traveling pack. My wet, numb fingers fumbled with the latches. Inside, I found my uniform. Clean linen shirt, embroidered with my name in a pattern like vines. A soft red leather tunic, reinforced with rawhide and steel, with the talisman of my guild tooled into the front panel. My leggings, the same construction in a darker shade of red, almost the color of dried blood. Black leather bracers and belt. Helmet of black leather and steel. A pair of camp slippers, not suited to hard use, but better than barefoot. And a cloak of oiled wool, lined with the fur of a wolf. I dressed slowly, leaving my tattered underthings on my body. <br><br>As soon as my tunic was settled, I gasped in shock. &quot;What, harlot?&quot; came the response from Morell. &quot;I grazed my wrist on the edge of my shirt,&quot; I replied meekly. He sat back, mollified, but still he gazed at me with suspicion. Marcus was looking at me with a remarkably intelligent expression for an ogre, but I felt certain he did not know the secret. I gave thanks that I still had a secret.<br><br>For the spells of warding and healing laid on my tunic were still intact. The broken skin on my wrists and neck was soon smooth, though ugly bruises remained. I felt new strength pouring back into me, so fast that it became an effort to continue moving as a half-drowned, beaten animal.  I knew then why I was being told to dress myself. The tunic reacted defensively to the presence of evil, and had likely given my captors quite a shock when they tore it from my body. It is possible to remove the tunic of an unconscious Guardian, but it gives the remover a bad time of it. I have heard it feels like acid on your skin, though it leaves no mark. I had thought that everyone knew my uniform was merely bespelled, and that a simple dispell magic cantrip or potion could remove the healing effects. I was very, very happy to be wrong. <br><br>As I dressed, the ogre's gaze became even more intent. As if he was waiting for some action on my part. Finally I stood before them, with my helmet dangling from my hand by the long leather straps that bound it to my head. Marcus had set down the rock, and spent the last few moments tying an enormous tangled knot in the end of the rope, and now laid the loop of hemp on the ground.<br><br>&quot;Put it around your neck, whore,&quot; said Morell as he rose to his feet. &quot;You will be led as one leads a cur.&quot; I leaned over to get the rope, as the ogre now stood within arms reach. He did not wish to touch me, but it seemed clear he'd chance the pain of my garb if it meant preventing my escape before I was bound. Something was strange about the knot. I followed the curving line of the strand in and out of the tangle, and realized that if it were pulled just so, the entire thing would come undone. The loop I was to put my head in was only an illusion! My heart beat faster, for I could easily escape this poor attempt at captivity. <br><br>I slowly bent, and placed the rope around my neck. Marcus held the long end tightly in his fist. The short end emerging from the knot may have seemed short to the ogre, but dragged on the ground when hanging off my small frame. It threatened to trip me, so I picked it up. &quot;Yes, you hold the rope,&quot; said Marcus, nodding wisely.<br><br>Morell was kneeling by his pack, rearranging the contents. &quot;Is the prisoner secure?&quot; he asked without looking up. <br><br>&quot;She is tied, but no Guardian is ever bound. NOW,&quot; the ogre shouted.<br><br>Marcus jerked on the rope, and the knot indeed unraveled like a puff of smoke. An enormous silver shadow flitted past me, between the ogre and Morell, and began to attack the half elf, all fur and teeth. I had no time to ponder this strange development. Morell began to chant, and I flew into action. I swung the helmet and it crashed against Morell's shoulder, knocking him off balance. The distance between us was cut in half as I exploded across the clearing. I leapt. Up in the air of my own free will for the first time today, I aimed a slippered foot at his neck, intending to break it. He hit the muddy earth and rolled to his feet, fury making him strong. I cursed the soft camp shoes on my feet as I went for his throat. <br><br>It was as though I had smashed into a mountain. He stood there laughing, and I realized that while he was not enough of a magic user to dispell my tunic, he had enough skill to shield himself. My breath was gone from my body, and I lay gasping on the earth, praying for my tunic to heal me faster. I had not realized the extent of my earlier wounds, however, and the tunic was drained until I was rested. He stepped forward, wiping tears of amusement from his eyes. <br><br>There was a horrible, crumbling sound, and Morell's eyes bulged. He screamed, a high pitched elven scream for all his human qualities. Marcus muttered something, and suddenly the silver blur was a wolf at the half-elf's throat, ripping through the leather collar. The blood poured, and Morell choked his last obscenity as the animal tore loose his still-beating heart.<br><br>All was silent in the clearing by the lake. I sat up, slowly, staring in wonder at the ogre. &quot;You are my enemy,&quot; I stuttered. &quot;Moreover, you appear to be an ogre, which means you have not the brains to cast spells or control animals. I am sworn to defend th..&quot;<br><br>&quot;These lands from your kind, and I guard against your evil for now and forever, I know, I know.&quot; Marcus sighed wearily, and waved his hand. The giant wolf, blood dripping from its muzzle, vanished.<br><br>I pulled myself to my feet using a fallen tree. I held out a shaking arm, pointing at the hideous ogre. I have had a very long day, I thought to myself, but this is not the time to hallucinate. &quot;If you be wearing an illusion, show yourself to me in your true form. If you be a true ogre, get you gone from my domain. I command you, for I am sw…&quot;<br><br>&quot;Sworn to defend these lands from your kind, on and on and on. Has anyone ever told you that you've a bad habit of rambling? Close your mouth, you'll catch bugs.&quot;<br><br>I managed to bring my jaws together with the last vestige of my willpower. I sagged against the boulder, still damp from when I sat on it after my unwilling bath. <br><br>&quot;Now, I haven't the time or the desire to expound for days while you absorb the impossible, so let's get this over with. I am an ogre. I am a magic user and healer. An army of proportions beyond the ken of your tiny human brain is currently massing to the east. You and I are going to defend the border. And if you tell me one more time how you are sworn to defend this land from me, you'll regret it. I love humans… with mustard.&quot;<br><br>For the first time in my glorious career as a Guardian of the Fist, a member of the only undefeated battle force in the history of Laurelii… I, Kiren d'Marr, fainted dead away.<br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uceldor.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Celdor</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ultrafx.com/note.gif BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>   <font color=#E9D756>(8/4/00 4:52:02 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrroleplaying.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=80.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Guardian of the Fist (LONG)</span><hr size=1> great story ;) <p><i>Who was that?<br>Just some bard...</i><br><br><b>Divine Grace</b></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uglorianafrostglitter.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gloriana Frostglitter</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>   <font color=#E9D756>(8/22/00 4:25:34 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrroleplaying.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=80.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Guardian of the Fist (LONG)</span><hr size=1> Avii,<br><br>When we talked about stories, why didn't you tell me you had posted one??<br><br>Great read!<br><br>Glory <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uraelven.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Raelven</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>   <font color=#E9D756>(8/31/00 1:24:24 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrroleplaying.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=80.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Guardian of the Fist (LONG)</span><hr size=1> /cheer!<br>More !
