An eye for an eye and all that shit. My geographical location in Texas probably influenced it as well, and I guess growing up a white southern male limited my compassion.<br>
<br>
But, having evolved throughout the various splendors of the world, it has become obvious that every moment I breathe, is another moment I will never breathe again. Ever. I will die. I will lose the only gift in my life, that is irreplacable. I understand that it is this very compassion for life that has forged such a strength for the death penalty, because people want to protect their loved ones, and themselves. <br>
<br>
Even though, the entire collective thought that you can take someone's life because they commited a crime of society isn't right. It isn't YOUR gift. Did the government give us life? Did the society at large conceive us? Of course the society provided us a shelter to become nurtured, and to live, but banishment and murder are not the same thing, and shouldn't be treated as such.<br>
<br>
If we are a society of peers, how can we judge each other? Moreso, while I agree what an atroscity murder is, who are we to judge what actions dictate enough to rob someone of life? And Meconan had a very good point, while you aren't teaching the inmate not to kill, you are in fact teaching the populace that if you kill, we kill. By that logic, what the government does is right, even if when the people do it, it's wrong. Even though we are a government of the people...<br>
<br>
Now I understand that I am not going to change the death penalty, and that all my post is, is conjecture and ramblings, but the simple fact is, is that because of our society's tendency to think if we can't see it, it must not be there, has allowed us to forego ethical principles to remain in territory that isn't ours to govern. You want to ostresize (dammit, sp?) someone? It's your country's right. You sheltered them, you didn't create them.<br>
<br>
Of course this is all moot anyway. If someone ever hurt my family members I would kill them, literally. As hypocritical as it is, I know I would bludgeon them to death with my own hands.<br>

Understand, WE just killed a man. As a predominantly Christian nation ( 'vengence shall be mine', 'Thou shalt not kill', etc ) many Americans have a hard time justifying killing anyone for any reason as it is against our religion.<br>
<br>
 Others object for 'political' reasons. The high costs of State Sponsored Murder. The innocent people killed due to poverty and lack of adequate legal representation, etc.<br>
<br>
 Still others object for social reasons. We would rather identify ourselves with 'civilized' countries like most of Western Europe who don't kill their citizenry rather than the current company we keep on this issue ( China, Pakistan, et. al ).<br>
<br>
 Undeniably Mr. McVeigh commited a most grievous crime and should never be allowed to reenter society. Sometimes ya gotta 'thin the herd'. But please don't make the mistake of dismissing him as just a 'Crazy'. He was the product of the American Military. The date of the attack was not a coincidence, it was an anniversary. Killing him only lends his 'cause' a martyr and satisfied HIS wishes. We let him take the easy way out IMO. Maybe another 50 years hard time would have produced the 'Remorse' we soooo desperately seemed to want. As for the victims and their families, do you honestly think the got 'Closure' ( puke) from this ? No they did not. Closure is something that happens to an escrow. Killing this man did nothing to change the real loss felt by these people. Maybe a sense of revenge, but certainly not 'closure' in any real sense.<br>
<br>
 What troubles me is that in our cult of personality all we focus on is the monster ( mcVeigh ) and not the problem ( how we deal with our most violent criminals ). Christians are admonished to be 'Christ like'. Jesus never killed and willingly gave his own life rather than do so. If we profess to be 'civilized' &amp; 'christian', we need to stop making murderers out of ALL citizens and pursue other policy. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uraedwulf.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Raedwulf</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 113<br> <font color=#E9D756>(6/12/01 9:53:58 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: way to go USA..</span><hr size=1> Wyvern:  The specifics of the death penalty (likelihood, time lag, appeals [unsuccessful 99% of the time]) are irrelevant to the lack of deterrence.  The only relevant factor according to the studies I've read, and there've been many, is that criminals don't think they'll get caught.  That's the same regardless of the success of the local constabulary.<br>
<br>
I cannot possibly fathom how you could justify killing the innocent (thereby creating many more victims), just to satisfy some bloodlust for the possibly guilty ones.  Especially when there is a perfect alternative in life imprisonment, which can possibly be used to rectify mistakes.  The news reported a man released from prison yesterday after 17 years, when it was conclusively presumed he wasn't guilty of a double homicide.  If his state had the death penalty when he'd been convicted, he'd be dead now, and we wouldn't have been able to fix that error.  Your option is unacceptable.<br>
<br>
<br>
Tullaian:  The sniper's death was necessary to protect other possible victims while he was still a threat.  McVeigh was no longer a threat.  And the criminally insane aren't release back into society after a verdict.  They go to an institution.  You won't live next to them.<br>
<br>
Timn:  Yes, it's the legal fees that ramp up the death penalty costs.  But should we eliminate those costs and possibly end up killing an innocent, just because it is costly?<br>
<br>
Smashgnome:  Although the media won't likely report it, there were two dozen injured victims and family members of the bombing that protested the execution.  They did not want more victims to be created, didn't agree that killing another was appropriate for their loss, or thought that letting him off this way was the easy way.<br>
<br>
Eraic:  There's no issue with &quot;trusting McVeigh&quot; if you stick him in jail for the rest of his life.  There's lots of states where they can stick you in jail, and you WILL NOT get out.  Period.  That's what I believe ought to be done instead of killing.<br>
<br>
Assilem:  Did you bother to check which of those 168 had their immediate family members speak out against the death penalty?<br>
<br>
Zephyris:  I haven't seen a single apathetic person post in this thread.  What the hell are you talking about?  Being against the death penalty is quite the opposite of being apathetic.  Those like me that have spoken against it, care very much about right and wrong.  I don't think it is right to kill someone simply because they are a killer.  That's not justice, it's simply revenge.<br>
<br>
You ought to try and get over your own prejudices and stereotypes, for it makes your arguments sound quite foolish.  I'm in favor of animal testing and environmentalist policies, against abortion and the death penalty.  Where are your foolish stereotypes now?<br>
<br>
Arnwolf:  Such a study has been done in Texas.  Violent crime is down 25% all over the country.  In Los Angeles, it's down even further, and the California use of the death penalty is more restricted and cumbersome than Texas.  When I said that it was accepted by Ashcroft (Bush's Attorney General), I wasn't just making it up.  Because your assumptions are in error, so are your conclusions. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uaoladariraveynfyre.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aoladari Raveynfyre</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 7<br> <font color=#E9D756>(6/12/01 10:52:30 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Crypt</span><hr size=1> Everyone has a right to life until they take their own rights away by killing someone else...

<br>
I can agree with all the points made about lack of deterrence, the times when innocents are executed, relative costs of appeals versus life in prison, but the bottom line here is that the death penalty is about revenge.  Indeed, the tone of this thread amply supports this.  <br>
<br>

I'm very familiar with the death penalty and have spent a good portion of my time talking to inmates (mainly serial killers) who were or are currently on death row. I've studied those who walked the path before McVeigh in hopes of learning from them to prevent those who will come after McVeigh. <br>
<br>
While I do agree that there are some people who are just beyond hope, I did stay up and wait for 8am EST to note the passing of Tim McVeigh. He is in his most basic form, still a human being ... a life. I will not rant on the mishaps of European History and it's use of execution (thanks Inquisition!) in an attempt to point the finger elsewhere. But I will say this, McVeigh punished himself by carrying out the actions he did. No one else is to blame (he was found many times to be mentaly competent). <br>
<br>
There are few moments in American history where an entire nation can feel the pain of a few. In the recent past we've carried the pain of Colombine High School, the L.A. Riots, the murder of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ron Goldman, and far too many natural disasters to name. I do in fact remember how I felt when I watched the coverage of the bombing for the first time. And it only takes a moment of imagining yourself in the place of any one of those victims or survivors to realize exactly how horrid a crime this was. And sadly, how just the punishment was in return. <br>
<br>
Every death is a tragedy in someone's eyes. The Oklahoma bombing was a tragedy in everyone's eyes. It was unwarrented and undeserved. I know I would never want to watch my child picked out of some rubble. And I certainly would beg for 5 minutes alone with the person responsible. I'm not above those feelings. Do I agree in captial punishment as revenge? No. Do I agree with it as a form of punishment? Yes. A fine line but a distinct one none the less.<br>
<br>
I know American politics in some people's eyes may seem crude but this is indeed a case where the puishment fit the crime. He indeed was guilty, showed no remorse for his actions, and most would say only showed guilt when faced with failing appeals on his life. I will agree that not every case is as black and white as this one and there are innocent people in jail. Project Innocence is a wonderful organization, but their numbers are not astronomical. I know of about 7 or 8 released in my home state due to help from them. So yes, 8 people get a renewal on life, but within a week there will be 8 new murderers to take their cells. So I ask ... where do we draw the line?<br>

McVeigh was unrepentant, yet expressed the wish to die. If you ask me, that indicates he's not sane. If he's not sane, he shouldn't be killed. <br>
.....<br>
<br>
He asked for his life to be taken because his life was basically already over. There comes a certain point in every death row inmate's life where they wish to die. To simply have it be over with. They know they have very little chance of returning to society unscathed. Can you honestly tell me Tim McVeigh could move into your neighbor hood and people wouldn't get upset? McVeigh sat in that cell for many years under the microscope of the judicial system, the media, and the citizens of the world. That alone could drive a man insane. However, he was not insane when he committed the acts that landed him in that cell to begin with. Any pain and suffering that occured to him he brought upon himself. I cannot feel sorry for him. And if I were a juror, I would not let it falter my decision to give him the just punishment to his crimes.<br>

<br>
Raedwulf, you'll notice that my post began with the three words &quot; If a Person&quot;.  It was meant to be an educational post directed at those who would say Mcveigh shouldn't be executed.  If a person believes we should have let him live, then they are being apathetic to the general moral beliefs that we share as a society of what is right and what is wrong.<br>
<br>
Apathy is not caring one way or another or not having the desire to take a stand for something.  In the case of these people, they dont care what is right, but instead want their personal opinions enforced.  <br>
<br>
Looking back at my post, I should have included some statement referring to those against executing him but at the time of the post, I made an error. I'm human, that tends to happen from time to time you know.<br>
<br>
Lastly, the things I pointed out at the end of my post go hand in hand with the bleeding heart liberal mentality which I cannot stand.  If you are offended by my comparisons/examples then pick an uncharted island and I'll lobby like hell to get you some death row neighbors.  I promise you that.<br>

You can keep claiming what you mean by the &quot;apathy&quot;, but you'd be wrong.  I can create my own definition for all sorts of words, but if it's not the definition anyone else uses, I might as well be typing in random letters on the keyboard.  Your use of the word &quot;apathy&quot; is akin to my claiming that when I say &quot;red&quot;, I really mean &quot;intelligent.&quot;<br>
<br>
I'm afraid that you are mistaken on quite a number of things.  &quot;they dont care what is right, but instead want their personal opinions enforced.&quot;  Isn't that the same as you?  Just because you are in the majority in the US, does this mean your position is right?  In 1776, the majority felt that slavery was right.  Were they correct?  Of course not.<br>
<br>
&quot;bleeding heart liberal mentality.&quot;  I'm sorry that you still don't get it.  I'm neither a &quot;bleeding heart&quot; nor a &quot;liberal,&quot; yet I'm against the death penalty.  Disagreeing with the majority is not being apathetic.  Your &quot;if a person&quot; intro is meaningless regarding your use of the term &quot;apathetic.&quot;  And as a number of those who have spoken out against the execution were family members of victims, your premise is contraindicated by the very matters you cite.<br>
<br>
If anyone disagrees with you, then they should be sent somewhere else?  I think you'll find yourself alone in a hurry.  Although many might agree with you on this point, there are bound to be other issues you won't agree with them on.  Even if you were a complete Tableau Raza (spelling?) and chose the &quot;majority&quot; opinion on every subject, you'd soon find yourself alone again, for everyone has views on some issue or another that aren't popular.  A few of the ones you've mentioned in this post would seem to put you in the minority.<br>
<br>
Again, I'm not suggesting that people convicted of &quot;capital crimes&quot; ought to be let out.  I think they ought to be locked up forever, or until we demonstrate that in fact, they weren't guilty.  We can't do that after an execution, can we?<br>
<br>
Just as a bit of a funny point:  Please let us know how to &quot;pick&quot; an uncharted island.  If it is uncharted (meaning unknown), how is anyone to pick it? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uassilemsoulvenom.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Assilem Soulvenom</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 264<br> <font color=#E9D756>(6/12/01 12:07:21 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: way to go USA..</span><hr size=1> Raed , no i didnt bother to e-mail them all individually, sorry.<br>

Anyone who disagrees can look up the definition and compare that to the life of Nelson Mandella. While Mr. Mandella was not killed in prison, he was most definetly a martyr.<br>
<br>
Folks, there is wrong and then there is WRONG. Perhaps McVeigh was a product of his society or an opressive government. Perhaps he was in his mind a revolutionary. Fine. However, how many folks are rallying to the cry &quot;Remember Timmy!!&quot; ...? Granted, I am not listening for it, but pretty much everyone that I know personally looked up, nodded, and went back to what they were doing.<br>
<br>
For those of you who are uncomfortable with your ability to sit on a jury and vote to put someone to death; you would have been disqualified from McVeigh's jury for that very reason if you were honest during jury selection.<br>
<br>
McVeigh killed 168 people- he timed the blast to a point in time when he knew that the building was going to be occupied. It wasnt an accident, it wasn't anything but premeditated mass murder. He admitted he did it. I see no reason to spend any more of my or anyone else's tax dollars, effort, or energy to keep him alive so he can 'repent' or 'come to regret his actions'. I dont give a rat's ass if he ever does or does not. We washed our hands of his excerable existance and are now moving on. <br>
<br>
Sure, there are problems with the US judicial system; sure, there are problems with today's society both in the US and globally. Maybe the death penalty isnt a deterring factor. Again, I ask you- so what? Does the fact that the death penalty may not be a deterrent obviate the fact that McVeigh killed ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY EIGHT human beings? Does the fact that killing McVeigh may not deter someone else from doing something similar in any way make the punishment less than appropriate?<br>
<br>
Finally, here is another question: Around 55 years ago, a group of people virtually eradicated a cultural group from the face of the earth. Their experiements and implements of death, terror, and destruction killed untold millions of people. Mass graves and concentration camps existed across Europe. While some of the people might have been 'just following orders', someone was giving those orders. Should one of those order givers-- one of the people who generated this abhorrent idea be allowed to 'ponder the mistakes of their past behaviour'? I am not trying to compare McVeigh to the Nazis, but seriously asking a question- At what point do you advocate the death penalty? Never? Only after killing more than say.... a thousand people? What about ONE person? What about war? Where do you say we should go to war? Never? At what point do you defend yourself or better yet- your child on the street? <br>
<br>
Sure, the death penalty is something that we dont want to have to use. I too would hate to see someone innocent be put to death. That certainly isnt the case here.<br>

You see, when we bomb places like nuclear reactors in the mid-east that can make weapons grade plutonium, or Saddam Hussein's chemical weapons storehouse that he builds next to a hospital, we also kill non-military personnel.  We killed a whole lot of civilians when we A-bombed Japan....twice.<br>
<br>
But you know what?  I, and again America as a whole, am willing to to accept those relatively innocent lives on our collective hands, in exchange for what happens as a whole.  And what you ask is that?  <br>
<br>
In the case of Japan, a bloody world war ended much sooner and with less loss of American life than would have been gained through conventional warfare.  And that is fine with me.  If the WWII Japanese, military and civilians alike, did not want to risk getting killed, they should not have attacked Pearl Harbor.  I am sure someone can put some spin on that, but fact is, we were at war, it was us against them, and Harry S Truman would have had one hell of a time explaining to my great grandmother why another one of her sons would have had to die storming some other crappy island hopping point on the way to Japan, like her firstborn son did on Iwo Jima, when the war could be ended by dropping 2 bombs with zero loss to American life.<br>
<br>
What happens in the case of the death penalty?  I am willing to take any odds you want to lay down that we have executed more guilty people than innocent ones in this country.  America as a whole, from state to state and under federal law, has agreed we are willing to chance killing an innocent person to keep the option of killing a guilty person available.  I count myself in that majority.  You apparently are in the minority.  You are welcome to your opinion, and free to state it, but it does not change the simple fact of what I was saying, that most Americans support the death penalty and are willing to take the chance of executing the innocent.  <br>
<br>
There is frankly, no other explanation.  We HAVE the death penalty in America.  By your own, (and I will not dispute them) assertions, we have executed innocent people in the past.  Yet the death penalty is still in effect, at least up through Monday.  Therefore, it logically follows that America as a whole agrees it is ok to remotely risk killing an innocent person (and in rare cases actually do it) in order to kill the truly guilty.  We may not like it, and we certainly want to avoid killing innocents, but my point is the representative democracy of America, and all states with death penalty laws, have voted to HAVE the death penalty, which includes the chance of killing innocents.<br>

China.<br>
<br>
We apply the death penalty rarely and only after a lengthy appeal process, hence it is not a detterent to criminals.<br>
<br>
Now for China.... (not saying I would rather live there mind you!)<br>
<br>
China has a population over 4 times larger than the USA, yet their crime rate is less than 1/10 of ours!  Why is that?<br>
<br>
In the US, if you do something that is not a capital offense, you will most likely spend a few years in prison, then get out.  You can do this several times, hopping in and out of prison, until finally (maybe) a judge deems you not reformable and puts you away for the rest of your life.  We frequently have people who get out of prison, realize that life in prison was BETTER THAN OUTSIDE FOR THEM (!!!!!), so they commint some small infraction so they can get back in.<br>
<br>
China..... you commit a non-capital offense, you will spend 7 years performing hard manual labor, getting 2 meals of rice and water each day.  You get out and perform some other small offense?  See the penalty for Capital offense, as it is the same.<br>
<br>
China's penalty for a capital offense...  You are given ONE trial, with a reasonable chance to defend yourself (with lawyer), and if convicted, you are taken out to the prison yard, made to kneel down, and shot in the back of the head by a soldier.  Your family is then required to collect your corpse for burial, and are given a bill for the cost of the bullet.<br>
<br>
Which system seems to be a better deterrent?<br>
<br>
We in the USA need to take a much firmer stance against crimes, and enforce much more swift and effective penalties, if we ever want to see a reduction in crimes.<br>
<br>
Torturing a criminal, being with them alone for 5 min with a baseball bat, drawing and quartering them (that's the 4 horses thing), etc. are all just demeaning to the people carrying out said punishment.  Just treat them like we do a rabid animal and them move on with life, feeling safer now that a danger to the general populace (and ME and everyone I know are included in that) has been removed.<br>

Castration can be fairly painless, it's the thought that makes most guys squirm.  Castration cuts the flow of male hormones thus drastically reducing the emotions that go unchecked and lead to violence.  It also leads to weight gain.<br>
<br>
Very few of the posts talked about the inhumanity of the death penalty... I'm not going to read through 4 pages to find the ones that did.   Most of the opposition was referring to the chance that an innocent person might be put to death.  That is why I'm personally opposed to it.<br>
