Time has come for me to leave EQ and quit entirely, but before I left I wanted to post a couple things. <br>
<br>
None of the following comments are what the guide program thinks.  Only myself.  <br>
<br>
First off, I wanted to say that the majority of the quellious players are fantastic.  I enjoyed helping many of you.  Some may know me from joking around, various role playing, or storytelling in Butcher <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
Secondly: While I was guiding I would always read the boards on QQ.  And please let me tell you first hand, there IS NO GUIDE/GM Favoritism.  Everything is handled strictly according to the Policies and procedures set forth.  I would get SO frustrated reading these posts badgering other posters here because they think Guides had something to do with their title, or reimbursement.  I do not mean to sound immature but 'Get off it!'.  Contrary to popular belief, guides cannot MAKE items.  I found that post particulary amusing.  All Guides can do is Summon and res. Thats it.  Nothing more, nothing less.  <br>
<br>
All resses are checked by the staff, and all summons as well.  So please tell me how a Guide can favor a player?  Besides deciding on who gets a certain title, and that goes to the best role player.<br>
<br>
3&gt; We are not robots.  We have personalities, feelings, high emotions, and we LOVE this game.  We love it so much that we want to help out the players, and we do a thankless job for FREE.  We get NO recognition whatsoever outside of the guide program.  When you yell at a guide, they are following policy.  Yelling will get you a warning if done enough.  I was never patient with players that would yell at me.  I would put an end to it right away. <br>
<br>
4&gt; This one had me a little upset, but I got over it.  There was an incident with a player on Quellious that will remain nameless.  Other than to say he is a mindless, selfish dwarf that twisted a story of what happened to him on a spawn dispute.  It was rather publicized, and I so wanted to post the truth of what really happened.  Needless to say I was forced to summon and bind the player in Butcher block after repeated warnings and continueless whining and un-cooperativeness.  Just to let you know if I would post the true events that happened here you would wonder why he wasn't suspended or banned.  It is amazing what happens in the summer when school isn't in session. <br>
<br>
5&gt; When you petition, please put the reason for the petition in the message.  Do you know how frustrating it is when you get a petition that reads &quot;GM&quot;.  The more info you can put in the easier it is to help you. <br>
<br>
6&gt; We do not control spawns, we never will, and never know when something you want will spawn. <br>
<br>
The guides on quellious are the very best.  You have NO idea how much we/they or I even care for the players.  We do everything in our power to make sure there is a clean, stable gaming environment.  Please try and remember this the next time you cannot get a ressurect for an Link death. <br>
<br>
If you go LD, and when you log in and see one general chat selection open in chat and 1900 still on Quellious, it is a good bet your ISP is flaky.  Do not say it is ou connection and our bug. <br>
<br>
If you are a monk or a necro and FD and die, it happens.  Get over it.  <br>
<br>
Hopefully this didn't come across as rude.  Remember to give all your guides a hug.  They do this for YOU.  and NO ONE ELSE but you.  Next time something doesn't go your way, or you find yourself about to yell...  Remember there is another person on the other side of that keyboard that only wants to help.  Sometimes they can't and it isn't their fault. <br>
<br>
The reason why we cannot ressurect for LD?  Think of all the people that abuse the system already.  How many people would just /quit when about to die and claim a linkdeath.  <br>
<br>
Again I enjoyed everyone on Quellious ) I will mist quite a few of you. I will not name the names otherwise I am sure about 10 people here who are too immature to realize guides can chat more with other players, might even call them friends, and never cross the line, will go ballistic and start a flame war. <br>
<br>
I cannot stress the fact enough that these people sacrifice their time for you.  Make it worth there while. They do not get paid, and get nothing in return for donating their time to help you. <br>

The one time I met you, you handled the unfortunate situation with incredible maturity and patience.  I am sorry now I never gotten to know you as an individual or told you how we appreciated your efforts. In all honesty, most players tend to leave guides alone because they didn't want to bother the Guide with a casual tell or even chitchat since we assume you/guides are busy with something very important..  However I promise if I see a Guide from now on, I will greet the Guide warmly and give the Guide a hug. =)<br>
<br>
I am very sorry that you and another guide had to endure that situation because of me.  We had a discussion with the player in question later and it was a horrid misunderstanding.  Things were said and done out of anger that cannot be undone, perhaps reputations had suffered a bit however no last harm was done.  <br>
<br>
I wish you well in everything you do outside of this little world.  You will be missed.  Maybe one day we'll meet in the game again.<br>
