<br>
I hair test can tell what your drug history is up to 7 years I think, but as I have been told privacy laws permit the testing center from providing data beyond the 3 month mark of the test.<br>
<br>
In the military, I understand that even if you are selected for a drug test you may not be tested.   That is, that they will have 100 people piss in a cup, and only test a handfull of them.  To save money.<br>
<br>
Drug testing is very expensive, and for most employers its too much of a bill.  Some companies may say they drug test you, but instead send you to a center to just collect a sample.  Much cheaper, than going through the test.<br>
<br>
If you drank gallons of water before you took your test, and passed most likely they didnt test you.<br>
<br>
Taking drugs on a job as crucial as an emergancy response unit is completely irresponsible, not that taking drugs is responsible on any level, and should be punished fully.<br>
<br>
Drugs are a choice, if you want to get down do it.  But not put peoples lives at risk to achieve it, no matter how much you think you can handle the buzz. <p><a href="mailto:dreamingwolfmail@home.com"><img src="http://www.fortunecity.com/bennyhills/flower/152/dwsig.gif" border="0"></a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ucubwynn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Cubwynn</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_star.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>p0\/\/3r-p0sT3r!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(2/4/02 1:17:28 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumrantsandravesbalancingissues.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1629.topic&index=27>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.bingobear.net/jewelry.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: /rude People who use Drugs on the Job.</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Never smoked the stuff...But i really doubt pot will kill anyone by itself.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

When jobs have drug tests only 10% of them actually get tested.  When the test gets messed up it comes back as a pass since they legally cant fail you.  The hair test can be faked too (by bleech), bleech your hair and it kills all nutrients in your  hair making it clean and clear of those 7 years of taking drugs, as well as shaving your head.  The longer the hair the more tests they can do, when it's shaved to a 1/4 inch they arent gonna find anything.  Tests are too expensive to retest so most jobs arent gonna bother.  Spinal Taps are the only tests (I know of) that are tamper-proof, but the danger in them is one slip on a very dangerous procedure will lead to a heavy law-suit as the testee finds themself handicap due to a drug test and forever addicted to pain killers. (too expensive and way too dangerous).<br>
<br>
<br>
Now that I've cleared up how easy it is to fake these tests I'll point out the real problem.  When someone  has a drug problem they could care less what they have to do other then their need for the drug.  They take them before they handle their baby, your baby, drive you in their taxi, while they build your house, while they do your taxes, you get the idea I'm sure.  Yes it's wrong but if you were in their shoes you would care less as well.  Try spending $300 every two nights on a drug that physically addicts you and come here and say you dont have to do them at work and you will be lieing to yourself.  First hand I know what happens to your body and first hand I'll tell you the tests are easier to beat then the drugs.  Coffee drinkers cant function in the morning until they get their coffee in them, the same with heavier drug users.  They get sick if they dont get their drugs, work isnt gonna matter at all.  It's not something you can pick up and put down in one day, when they have an addiction it can take years and sometimes  still never get over their problem.  Look at it like eq or these message boards (without actually getting sick).  People quit and come back time after time, some people dont even bother trying to quit.  Then when people do quit eq they find themselves playing other games like daoc (just like switching drugs).  The ones that do quit and quit for good on both eq and the msg boards are very few and far between. Now if a game can do this to hundreds of &quot;normal&quot; people, just think what a addicting drug can do...  While way off based because of the harmfull effects of drugs some who have never taken drugs may see what I mean a little bit.<br>
<br>
No doing them at work , hell in general is wrong but usually there's more to it then just right and wrong.  It's called an addiction and is classified as a disease or sickness.  Most jobs (including police officers) cant just fire you for taking drugs.  They have to send you to a detox first then give you another chance.  Most employers dont even want to hear they have a drug problem at work.  Their insurance goes up thanks to 1 person and they can be sued if they just fire them (most jobs).  They have a sickness, it's not just about trying to be cool anymore to heavy drug addicts.<br>
<br>
<br>
But yes you're all right, the woman should be fired and did do something wrong.  There is no physical addiction to weed, she was just being stupid and nothing more nothing less.  But (if you ever smoked it you'd know, otherwise you wouldnt) she did nothing worse then having one beer at work on your lunch break.  If you ever did this you are just as guilty and should be fired too.<br>

Ummm we were talking bout pot/hash here /nod. If ya smoke weed for $150 a day you're either smoking some expensive shit or you're smoking 15-20 grams of chronic or QP of mexican dirt (Not saying it can't be done, but you'd have to be smoking pretty much nonstop for 24 hours, I think the most I've gone through is around 50 grams of dirt in a day). Secondly, THC, nor any other substance in marijuana are addictive. By addictive i mean physically addictive, sure you may be mentally addicted, but a mental addiction is no worse then say an EQ addiction. When you have a mental addiction you're not really addicted at all, cause you can always quit something that you're mentally addicted to, and when you can quit you're not really addicted. In my opinion marijuana should be legalized, but that's a whole other thread in itself. However, lets say that this fire truck driver smokes marijuana regularly (Doubt she'd smoke it at work, if she even did smoke it at work, that was not stated, but she wouldn't have smoked weed at work if she didn't smoke it during her freetime). After your become a regular user of marijuana it doesn't affect your senses much, it affects the way you think, giving you a new perspective, which i believe is good every now and then, if you do anything too much its bad, this goes for pot, EQ, alcohol, sleeping, etc... basically anything. I don't have the link for the news article, but there was a test done on how marijuana affected driving, i'll try to find it, the results were that regular users of marijuana drove better when high, while people who don't use the drug much had slightly slower reaction times, but not a significant amount (sure you can argue that every millisecond is important), but then again if your tired that'll add on to your reaction time prolly more then that pot will. I'm not going to argue that pot is good for you, cause it does reduce your short term memmory with about 10% if you smoke it alot, every day, but about a year after quitting your memmory will almost be back to what it was before. I'm getting off subject here, so guess i'll finish this post with each to his own, if ya chose to not smoke there is more for the rest of us =P <p><img src="http://sprite.20megsfree.com/valek.gif"><br>

To save money, it's the people they test that are random. Only about 10% of the company normally pisses in the cup. You never know which 10%, and neither do the people administering the test. They roll a ten-sided die at most units. Some have a number generator on computers for it.<br>
<br>
Bottom line is, if you've pissed in the cup, it's getting tested. I've seen units do a full company test and every single one of the guys who did something came up hot. We're talking literally dozens of guys (I've only seen that many once, and it was up at Ft. Lewis a few years ago when a bunch of soldiers turned out to be dealing and using). <p><center>

The results were only in the time in minutes:seconds to complete the slolom, and did not attempt to measure anything specific to hand-eye-coordination or reaction time.  <br>

<br>
An Indiana businessman who tried to make a friendly gesture to some fellow travelers found out he was hanging around with the wrong crowd. <br>
<br>
Police say the man, Anthony K. Kiskorna, 36, of Granger, Ind., offered a marijuana cigarette to some men staying at a St. Peters hotel, only to find out the men were undercover police officers who were in town for a drug conference. <br>
<br>
Sheriff James D. Russell of the Taney County Sheriff's Department in Forsyth, Mo., said he and five members of his undercover drug unit were relaxing in the hot tub and around the pool at the Drury Inn on Thursday night when Kiskorna approached them. <br>
<br>
Russell said that Kiskorna was friendly and said if he had known the men were going to be there he would have brought down some &quot;dynamite weed&quot; he had in his room. <br>
<br>
Russell said that while Kiskorna went back to his room to get the drug, he went back to his room to get his badge. When Kiskorna returned, he got into the hot tub, lit what appeared to be a marijuana cigarette and offered it to the men. <br>
<br>
Russell said he responded by showing Kiskorna the badge. &quot;At first he kept insisting it was fake,&quot; he said. &quot;Once he realized it was real, he was real quiet.&quot; <br>
<br>
The sheriff said they contacted authorities in St. Peters and detained Kiskorna until police arrived. Police confiscated a marijuana cigarette, a hemostat or &quot;roach clip&quot; and a plastic bag containing a green leafy substance. <br>
<br>
Russell said he was shocked by Kiskorna's behavior because when he had first approached them, the officers had asked Kiskorna if he was in town for the police conference. &quot;Sometimes people just don't think real well,&quot; he said. <br>
<br>
Kiskorna was issued two municipal summonses - one for possession of drug paraphernalia and the other for possession of marijuana under 1.2 ounces. He was released on $500 cash bond. Police say Kiskorna is employed by Atlas Restaurant in South Bend, Ind. <br>
<br>
&quot;There are obviously things you should never do,&quot; said Sgt. David Kuppler of the St. Peters police. &quot;Smoking marijuana is bad. But smoking marijuana in a hot tub full of undercover drug agents is even worse.&quot; <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
