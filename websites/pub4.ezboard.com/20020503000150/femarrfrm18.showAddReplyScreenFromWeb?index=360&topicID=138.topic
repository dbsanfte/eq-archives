&quot;We now come to the issue of mention of Jesus in the Jewish Talmud. Here McDowell's lack of scholarship is again painfully evident. In fact, we are again tempted to say that because the correct information is so readily available, perhaps his failure to provide it is a deliberate attempt to mislead. We must first explain that the present Talmud contains virtually no mention of Jesus. This is because there was much persecution of the Jews during the Middle Ages, and many Jews were afraid that the presence of the numerous unfavorable references to Jesus which existed in the Talmud of the time would bring down the additional wrath of the Christians. These references were gradually eliminated, by agreement, during the many subsequent recopyings of the Talmud which occurred over the years. However, most of these references to Jesus have not been lost to our view, since they have been collected by scholars from ancient copies of the Talmud and republished several times. Of course, McDowell is blissfully unaware of all of this. If we look at the materials con-cerning Jesus which had been removed from the later copies of the Talmud, we can see that they say that he was a bastard and a magician who learned magic spells in Egypt or else stole the secret name of God from the temple and used it to work magic or miracles. The father of Jesus is also claimed to be a soldier named Pantera. At any rate, authorities are agreed that most of this Talmudic material derives from the period from 200 to 500 A.D., and represents Jewish attempts to deal with the growing strength of Christianity. It makes no attempt to be historically accurate and, in fact, is of no use in determining if Jesus was an historical person. McDowell, of course, mentions none of this, and is also in error (or purposely misleads) when he says that &quot;Comments in the Baraila are of great historical value:&quot; and then gives a quote which leaves off the initial few words, namely &quot;And it is tradition ...&quot;. This means that the Talmudic scribe was merely reporting what had been said by Christians (and this is in about 300 A.D.). The passage describes how Jesus was stoned and hanged for practicing magic. That doesn't quite sound like the New Testament account.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;When you add up all of the following facts, the case for the existence of Jesus as an historical person becomes rather remote: 1) there are no proven, legitimate references to the existence of Jesus in any contemporary source outside of the New Testament (which is really not a contemporary source, as it was written from 30 to 70 years after Jesus supposedly died), 2) There is no evidence that the town of Nazareth, from which Jesus' mother supposedly came, ever existed at the time he was supposedly living there, 3) the existence of Jesus is not necessary to explain the origin or growth of Christianity (were the Hindu gods real'?), 4) the New Testament accounts do not provide a real &quot;biography&quot; for Jesus until you look at the Gospels. The earlier Pauline epistles imply only that he was a god, and 5) the biblical accounts of the trial and death of Jesus are logically self-contradictory and legally impossible. Jesus could not have been executed under either Roman or Jewish law for what he did. Whatever you call what he did, it was not a capital offense under either system. Rather, it looks like someone is trying to make Old Testament prophecies of the death of the Messiah come true by fabricating a scenario which simply doesn't make sense legally.&quot;<br>

<br>
I mentioned in previous statments- It is futile to attempt to prove the existance of God through arguements... Tell someone that God did X or Y and they will say prove it and prove everything about that, then prove that all that ever existed. The bible talks about those that will always be blind...<br>
<br>
I could site other documents and you would continue to argue against those as well. No matter how much documented proof be presented before you- you will never accept them or be dissuaded- and for this I will no doubt sound like an arrogant ass.<br>
<br>
Even if I attempt to strictly use logic or if I continue to site outside anti-christian refrences you would proceed in doing your best to discredit the documents and the logic. <br>
<br>
No amount of arguing the existance of God or attempting to somehow prove to you that Jesus existed will ever be fruitful.<br>
<br>
The &quot;futile to argue&quot; thing I began with before comes from having this argument many times before and realizing that people are never &quot;won&quot; over to believing in God. No amount of debate is ever going to help with this subject. For every resource I can name you will undoubtedly furnish a counter.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> The spirituality and Belief in God that I have is not something that I or anyone can ever argue into you.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
If I say: &quot;This document is valid because...&quot;, you simply counter with: &quot;No, it's not because...&quot; and then we are back to square one... thus it is futile.<br>
<br>
When it comes down to it friends, we are simply going to have to agree to disagree.<br>
<br>
I will leave this thread by saying that,<br>
<br>
I believe that there is a God because believing in the Chaos of evolution and submitting to the hopelessness of NO afterlife is just too horribly depressing for me to go on living. (I really mean that)<br>
<br>
What is this whole existance of ours worth if we are only here to work, propagate, grow old and fade away to dust? Should I be ok with being insignificant? Should I be contented to go on living knowing that nothing I do matters and the only reason we are here is because of some goo or ooze from billions of years ago? <br>
<br>
If I sound arrogant in my belief in God it's because I HAVE to believe- otherwise I question my very existance and the hopelessness is just too much for me.<br>
 <br>
I <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> choose</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> to believe in the evidence put before me which offers me hope, love and a prospect of a Heaven- and I need those things just as I need my very next breath.<br>
Argue that all you want.<br>
<br>
IMO- When it comes down to it- My belief in God and his son Jesus gives me hope. I respectfully won't tell you what your not believing in God gives you as I really have no idea.  I will continue to cling to my hope- I need it.<br>
<br>
Best wishes to you all and my highest regard and respect to you for your comments, they were very well thought out and elegantly presented.<br>

Dunkk, I very much respect the above statement. I have no desire to &quot;deconvert&quot; believers and I certainly feel that if religion helps people and is not destructive to others then nobody has any business trying to take that away.<br>
