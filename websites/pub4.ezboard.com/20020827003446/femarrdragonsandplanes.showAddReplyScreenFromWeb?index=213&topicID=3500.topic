<br>
Reddoak, do you know what a fanatic is? I am sure you know what the word means, but have you ever actually met one? Most people, almost all people,<br>
will quit is they cant win. We can call that a 'NORMAL' responce. But it isnt<br>
the only responce. Do the following names mean anything to you?<br>
Lexi, Priss, Justicia, Shadon, Lyra, Barak,Jyleal? Those are just the ones I can remember.<br>
They all left the server for the same reason. They didnt like the way things were going. It doesnt have anything to do with ME, per se. It has to do with wanting<br>
to have fun. They wanted to play. And people were making it un-fun to play.<br>
Everytime they went somewhere to do something, since they were not part of the<br>
'established order' they were not very codially told to leave.  These were MY freinds, and in my way I contributed to them leaving. And I miss them.<br>
When I hit level 50, after certain unhappy events, I was a level 50 player with no group. Not because I wasnt asked. I was asked all the time. But because<br>
the 'powers that be' had a lock on the clerics. The 'powers that be' didnt like<br>
ole Chiteng. People now can say anything they like, my reply is you dont know <br>
@#%$' You could NOT do anything fun, without a cleric. Period.<br>
That was the way it was. I was shut out. So I left, when the next server opened.<br>
I had hoped that things would be diffrent there. They were. They were far worse.<br>
The top guild was usurped by the ebayers, and I was excluded again.<br>
Until I got them all banned, for ebaying. You see I dont always lose.<br>
The six top players on the server gone. But it was a hollow triumph. Some other guild, that didnt ebay replaced them. so after a long time I returned to Emarr.<br>
Almost all my freinds were gone. The few that were left, didnt really want to<br>
acknowledge me. It was 'too risky', because certain muscle had been flexed<br>
while I was gone. An example had been made of Justicia. <br>
<br>
Do you actually know why certain people hate her?(him?)(never was sure)<br>
Because she got screwed over on a PoH raid and when she happened to be in zone<br>
on a totally different day and raid, there was a party wipe, oddly enough by the<br>
same people that had screwed her over. So she refused to ress them.<br>
She refused to allow them to tell her what to do with her character.<br>
That is all. They shut her out. They also made damn sure that anyone who grouped with her knew that it might not be a singular event. Hard for a cleric,<br>
even level 53 to solo.<br>
You know, that kind of situation just lights a fire in a crusader. <br>
There is another reason, but I promised Owynn I would try to avoid bringing it up.<br>
<br>
But in any case, I see that kind of a power lock as an absolute evil. My money<br>
is just as green as theirs. I have every right to play. So did she.<br>
Parnum was another sad case. But apparently he is happy now. He was not happy<br>
when I returned to the server. He had been cut out. The reasons dont matter.<br>
What matters is that it was the same power block that enforced it.<br>
I found him wandering the server, grouping with pickup groups, trying to find something fun to do. Abandoned by his former comrades. Since then, more infor mation has been provided. But at the time, that is how It looked.<br>
<br>
So I ask you Reddoak, do you know what a fanatic is? I blame THEM for the loss<br>
of my freinds. I rage against the power. Yes to all outward appearance you can <br>
say I have accomplished NOTHING. But you cant know that. No one can say<br>
how things would have been, had I not been here. Hammering away.<br>
But more importantly, they win because people give up. People fight for a while<br>
and then they realize things wont change, and they realize they are not having fun,<br>
and they leave. The 'powers that be' win. Those that oppose them vanish.<br>
They have tried to make me vanish many times. Several times I did. But always some fool comes back and lights the fire. If I dont vanish, they have not won.<br>
Sure they HAVE defeated me. I will never be allowed to play or take my place<br>
in the ranks of the mighty. So in that sence, yes they win. But there are other<br>
battles to be fought. <br>
<br>
Tell me Reddoak, since we are playing this little mental exercise. If you totally agreed with me on every level. Would you dare to say it on this forum?<br>
Would you? Do you know what would happen to you if you did? Would you face that for principle? That is what I do Reddoak. I fight for PRINCIPLE.<br>
And I know I am right. I wont give it up until all the malefactors are gone,<br>
(getting to be an actual possibility, there are not many left)or I find a different crusade.<br>
<br>
<br>
As for Nuldar, I cant speak for him. I assume he would prefer that WE settle the issue and not involve him. If you ask me what I think, I would guess that he is dismayed that we all cant get along. But Nuldar knows more than you do.<br>
Certainly more about ME, than any of you.<br>
He knows more than I do. Although he doesnt talk much you would do VERY well <br>
to listen to him when he does. I didnt say he 'gave me permission' I said<br>
I explained my options, and he said he understood. That is not at all the same thing.<br>
<br>
If everyone left me alone, what would happen would be, I would post, it would get buried,and that would be that. NO I did NOT say I would stop posting.<br>
But the endless BS that passes for dialogue would not occur. I think that would be a better result. I cant say if I would chime in on other posts. I have given it no thought.<br>
<br>
As for the condesending tone and word choice:<br>
<br>
To me the truth of the ugliness on Erollis Marr, the greed and avarice,<br>
the back stabbing, cheating, exploiting, ninja-looting, training (fill in the blank)<br>
To me the truth is so obvious, so pervasive, that it cannot be denied.<br>
Yet I can get no one to acknowledge it. I can give you 15 names, of people<br>
that KNOW damn well, that their teamate has done bad things, and they say<br>
'we dont care'. People who are not evil themselves, but they allow it.<br>
Over time my attitude has hardened. My contempt for such creatures shows.<br>
My answer to 'we dont care' is 'well I sure as hell DO CARE. So get out of my way'<br>
But they dont do that either. They happily throw themselves in the way.<br>
That is why I call them 'sheep'<br>
Have you ever been to Montana? I watched a heard of sheep fall into a 20 foot<br>
gully, because the alpha-male fell in, and they all followed him.<br>
I have that picture in my mind, ALOT, when dealing with people on Erollis Marr.<br>
<br>
I realize that you are just trying to get me to quit. But I have indulged your questions. If you have any others depending on time, I will consider them. <p>“It is clear that the individual who persecutes a man, his brother, because he is not of the same opinion, is a monster.”

After reading all of that, you hoenstly do make a lot more sense to me than before.  I understand firsthand the results of jerks in the game ruining the fun of others.<br>
<br>
As for this:<br>

Yes, if I did agree with you on every level, I would say it on this forum, regardless of the consequences.  I've put up with my share of bullies, both in real life and in game, and I am not that willing to back down to someone else that pushes me around.  However, as I have not experienced the events you have firsthand (I only started playing EQ in April 2001), in my eyes I cannot justify carrying out a crusade to seek vengeance on those that have caused my friends to quit.<br>
<br>
I recall your first labeling of me as a sheep... I posted in the &quot;Should Mitch be Banned?&quot; poll that I think she should stay, that she added a lot of spice to the boards.  Your comment was (not the actual words, but close enough) that &quot;That is obviously the reason why she does.  But since when do the opinions of sheep matter? They certainly don't to me&quot;.  I originally had never sided for or against you, but when that point came, I was instantly given a negative impression about you.  I admit that my lack of the past didn't help much, as all your posts seemed to be were ramblings about incidents that happened years ago, and players that had long since retired from EQ.   I can understand now why you did label me as a sheep, and can actually forgive you for doing that.<br>
<br>
As of right now, I'm not going to be hostile towards you any more.  I can understand and even somewhat empathize what you went through.  My post was never an intention to get you to stop posting, I just wanted to get to know why you post, and that's all.  Feel free to continue posting at will.  I still don't agree that your crusade is worth it, but at least I know why yo<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <p><p align = "center"><table align="center">

<br>
Chiteng let's look at it this way, you are the one that always asks for proof whenever someone makes a statement you don't like. You tried to tell us there was some kind of silent majority that believed in your stupid arse pointless crusade but they were too scared to step forth and show their colours. I have repeatedly asked you for proof of this silent majority and you have not been able to provide it, therefore you are a fvcking liar. This is the same way you treat people Chiteng if they can't provide proof to you, even when they do provide proof to you you simply ignore it and call them a liar anyway. How does it feel to be treated the same way you treat other people Chiteng? Eat a fvcking dick up till you hiccup.<br>
<br>
You have no right to cry foul or cry harassment Chiteng, we are just treating you the same way you treat us. Give us the proof of this &quot;silent majority&quot;, if there is no proof provided then we have no choice but to call you a liar.<br>
<br>
You will stop posting if we stop harassing you? And asking big bad old Dwarkarn isn't a good idea because you will never get his compliance? What a fvcking short memory you have c0ck boy. You offered this type of deal a few months ago, I stopped posting about you and never even mentioned your name for a month, yet you continued right along posting your daily doses of verbally malfunctional jism over these boards. You were the one that didnt hold up your end of the deal shitbrick, so don't even bother even mentioning my compliance. The people of this board are too smart to fall for your &quot;if you stop harassing me I will stop posting&quot; bullsh|t Chiteng, you insult them for even bringing it up.<br>
<br>
You are a fvcking liar Sh|teng, the only harassment you get is brought on by yourself, looks like the toll of being a liar is finally showing, why don't you just admit it and apologise to us for it? Or maybe even provide proof of the silent majorit, I mean I am sure it exists right? I mean after all you said it does!<br>

<br>
You know what Chiteng? I agree with you on one point...to a certain degree. Ostracism happens. It happens in games, shool, jobs, the coffee shop, hell even on the highway. One thing I've never understood about people that get upset though (and leave a game they enjoy)....why not pick your toys up and move to a different sand box (ie. Find a new guild, find a new zone, etc.)? If someone wants their little clique, let them have it.<br>
<br>
I've never cared much for cliques. No one person is better than anyone else. Not even you, Chiteng. You may see yourself as being the Holy Crusader of all that is Good, but you know what? You're doing exactly what you're raging against, whether you realize it or not. You have put yourself on a pedestal so high, that you can't let yourself see the "lesser" people. If someone's opinion differs from your own, then they are "below" you, and not worth considering. Tied into this is a question: If everyone's opinion (that isn't in agreement with yours) doesn't matter to you, then why should your opinions matter to anyone else?<br>
<br>
One more quesiton if you will...<br>
<br>
In a world of innumberable problems, why does a problem in a <i>game</i> matter so much to you? Yes, you have explained your actions several times; however, those explanations don't carry enough weight to justify a crusade of the magnitude to which you have carried it.<br>
<br>
Here's a small reality check for you:<br>
<br>
Did you know that 97 people were injured in a train derailment yesterday, six of which were critically injured? Do you think these injured people or their families give two shakes about a game called Everquest? Why not a crusade to make the railways safer? Or a crusade to implement more stringent safety regulations?<br>
<br>
Did you know that 83 people lost their lives in an air show accident in the Ukraine yesterday? Do you think the families of those 83 people have even <i>heard</i> of Everquest? Poor planning, and pilot error is purported to be the cause. Why not a crusade to make the Ukrainian military train their pilots better? Or to make their logistics officers plan properly?<br>
<br>
I'll close this little essay with this,<br>
<br>
What do you hope to "win" with this crusade? Even if you perceive yourself as winning, you've still lost. All of the time that you devoted to researching offender's pasts, observing their behaviour, etc....you'll never get that time back. You say that you're married (it's been a while, I'm assuming this is still the case). The time that you've spent on this crusade you could have devoted to your wife, and/or your family. But you can't now, because that time is gone forever.<br>

I really cant be more clear on this. My objection to what is occuring rest SOLEY<br>
on Kerryn's use of ONE WORD. It would not bother me at all if he would simply use dishonest. Do you understand? A VALID objection such as me being condesending<br>
or belittling, is VALID, how can I object? GO AHEAD hail all you want.<br>
That DOESNT bother me. Being wrong, is NOT the same as being a liar.<br>
I am only WRONG if I accept YOUR and HIS view on that. You dont realize<br>
that I dont accept that. I made 4 posts that clarified my position.<br>
You will never get me to accept that I tried to decieve anyone.<br>
You want to believe otherwise, that is YOU. <br>
<br>
If you have any shred of the intellectual integrity that you try and portray,<br>
you can see that from my point of view you three are delibretly misrepresenting.<br>
a MINOR incident. THAT OFFENDS ME. I will fight back.<br>
It would end if someone would prevail upon Kerryn to stop doing it.<br>
I dont really care what Dwakarn says, he is mindless, his opinion is like sand in the eyes. It obscures not clarifies. But I do care about what Kerryn is doing.<br>

I had hoped that you would have given up and decided just to drop this whole thig but you continue to carry on.<br>
<br>
I think a majority of posters here can understand your frustrations and your desire for justice for those friends of yours that left because of what they did.  It has been three years what good has come of it?  <br>
<br>
What good have you done in the game?<br>
<br>
I think everyone would agree that the halocost was a terrible thing and we would do anything to change that and bring justice to them but guess what there is nothing we can do about it almost everyone that commited it has long since died.  <br>
<br>
Your situation is no where similiar except in principle.  A lot of those people that did these things to your friends have quit the game and moved on.  You cannot change the past Chiteng, no matter how hard you try.  What is done is done and the only thing left to do is learn from the experiance and try and make sure that never happens again.  <br>
<br>
What you are doing is going after people that no longer play the game or in areas of the game that do not even effect you yet.  You cannot bring your friends back and you are powerless to do anything to the people that wronged you and your friends, except be a pest and hijack good threads and by being a pest and stalking them you turn the new readers against you.<br>
<br>
What good is a crusade without followers?  Without any semblence of change? How are you changing the server for the good Chiteng?  Hmm how?  <br>
<br>
They say the road to hell is paved with good intentions and judging by what you have posted I think you could be a poster child for that phrase.  Do not let your crusade turn you into what you depise most what you are crusading against but sadly the change has begun you have begun stalking Kerryn and you have not condemned Mitch for intentionally training when you have done so towards Vendrix, how much further down the road to hell will you travel Chiteng before you realize that you are turning into that which you hate?<br>
<br>
I am sure your wife has already started seeing the change occur due to the fact I believe that being called a liar in the world effects you in the real world and your constant frustration with your unsuccesful crusade to rally the masses towards your crusade.<br>
<br>
Well enough Chiteng, I hope you see the points that myself and others have tried to make you see either nicely or in some cases rudely.<br>

<br>
The way things are right now:<br>
<br>
Kerryn feels he has the right to hop into any thread I post in, regarless of content<br>
and call me a liar. It doesnt matter if its a thread 'I' started, or one a I joined.<br>
<br>
I wont tolerate that. I am able to react. He has stated that he was willing to do something, it was a bit vauge, if I stopped counter-posting.<br>
<br>
But he still will feel free to hop into any thread I start, or join and call me a liar.<br>
<br>
Why are you not jumping on HIM for doing that? I do no more than retaliate.<br>
<br>
I have asked his, politely, as an adult to stop. I have offered him the word dishonest to use in its place. He refuses. <br>
<br>
I am sorry, there is no solace. Things will go as they go. When and if<br>
you hail on HIM for doing the SAME exact things that HE is doing TO ME,<br>
then and only then will your complaint be considered non-partisan.<br>

Don't suppose to go by a nickname Flyback do you? there's a Flyback on EFnet who keeps going in the Athlon channel. Everyone hates him, and he gets banned every time he goes in, but he keeps coming back when he's unbanned. He's threatened to kill a few people so far, despite the fact that he's supposedly highly religious. When people ask how a religious person can want so many people dead, he likes to say things like &quot;too bad it's illegal and a sin to kill people&quot; like that makes it any better to say it.<br>

You seem like you have the same problems that guy does, how many different drugs are YOU on?<br>

Whilst I never met Koryo in game and his attitude never effected me, you hijack good threads in an attempt to further your own personal goal.<br>
<br>
Who do you think is going to by biggest irritant?<br>
<br>
We all have our motives for doing various things but most of us realise when we're banging our heads up against a brick wall. <br>
<br>
You aren't accomplishing anything, you're not engaged in conversation with him. I don't even think he reads these boards. If you say he is an ass then so be it. I can't make that judgement but I'll accept that many people agree with you. <br>
<br>
Personally I believe that in an attempt to dishonour Koryo and anyone else you have fallen into the trap of becoming an abusive player yourself. I know that's not how you want to be percieved. There have been times when you have been right, but you've become focused so much on your target that everything else has gone out of the window.<br>
<br>
Whereas once you said that you found swearing and people being vulgar to be a bad thing you have since degenerated into swearing and becoming vulgar from time to time yourself. Surely you see that you have stooped low to do so in your own eyes.<br>
<br>
You started off by answering any points made against you but I think with all the best will in the world you are not one of life's great debaters. Unfortunately you trap yourself easily and a great example is how this all started. <br>
<br>
You made the mistake of saying that you had possibly posted 5 times in a week and not 30 times. I think you simply forgot that people can track this but I genuinely believe you were surprised to see how much you posted. At this point you were merely wrong but you then get called on it.<br>
<br>
You could have gained a lot of respect here. You could have said, you're right. I realise I posted more then I thought&quot; and we would have taken it as just an error. But you didn't. You had to continue forcing the issue and at that point you became a liar.<br>
<br>
If you want to choose a crusade you could always choose a worthwhile one, but degenerating these boards to get at a select handful of players who mostly never bothered anyone but you makes you the greater of the two evils in peoples eyes. <br>
<br>
I have issues with people on this server just as you do. People that spoilt your fun from time to time, just as they do me. But I feel better at night knowing that in the end I win, they haven't spoilt anything I can't repair.<br>
<br>
As Dwarkarn has stated this has consumed you, I think to a point where it's affecting you in real life also. I think this upsets you more then you let on.<br>
<br>
Ease up Chiteng and I promise you that everyone will ease up on you, including me, and your quality of life will get better.<br>
