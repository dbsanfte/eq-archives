<br>
Well i don't agree with tyra that  teachers, now a days due to teacher shortage any moron with a 4 year degree can eb hired on as a teacher.( and before you say moron can not geta  4 year degree, I say weather you graduate 1 in your class or dead last that degree only says you graduate).<br>
So I am not to comfort with the mind set of theses teachers witha gun when the class spends 45 mins calling her Old woman Wilson.<br>
 NOW some training In hand to hand and a few take down and subission technique i would suportt 110 percent.<br>
 Think<br>
What were these teachers doing while this man walked around Knifing this poor children, probably trampling they students as the dashed towards the exit looking for the &quot;proper authority to handle the situation&quot;.( This is probably what the pacifist teacher would have done).<br>
 Now if  the scholl teacher were trained, in some sort of hand to hand 2 teacher could have easily taken down and subdue  this cowardly son of a bitch before he ended up killing eight children and injuring 21 others.<br>
 This  Training could have also prevent alot of the death in Colonbine, if the teacher were trained to react to this situation.<br>
 &quot;An agresser never expect his victim to fight back when they have the advantage, so when  vitctim attacks the agresor will be stun  at this action giving enough time for the victim to gian the uper hand....&quot; Ashida Kim<br>

<br>
Figure a lot of this has to do with a few things.  Society's penchant for not making you responsible for your own actions is a big one.  Oh he/she has a learning disability, or abused, or misunderstood.  Okay so we're all not perfect, but as the theme song says &quot;Don't do the crime, if you can't do the time.&quot; <br>
<br>
Hinkely goes to shoot the president.  Why?  Because he's in love with Jodie Foster and wants her attention.  So he'll get it from the press, this sick &amp;*^&amp;* has his 15 min of fame, and he gets charged mentally incompetant &lt;sp&gt; and is not to blame because he wasn't in his right mind. &lt;GAG&gt;<br>
<br>
Kids used for how long to do dope deals because they can't be charged as adults, law changes but the mentality is still there.  Kids are recruited and trained by adults, and sent out like guard dogs on society.  And we're surprised at the havok they cause?<br>
<br>
No answers so long as misguided, sick, abusive (&amp;*(s are out there raising children, or hurting children, hunting children. What's that quote? &quot;You have to take a test to drive a car, but any sick (*&amp;( can be a parent&quot;.<br>
<br>
The best I can think of is inform the kids, make them responsible for thier own actions.  Support them.  But when they do something and you can't figure out why...get help! But don't give them that &quot;it's not your fault&quot; BS, rather tell them &quot;okay you screwed up, now what are you going to do to fix it?&quot;<br>
<br>
And enough with the &quot;Bubble Headed Bleach Blonde that comes on at five, and can tell you about a plane crash with a gleam in her eye&quot; crap.  If they couldn't become infamous, how many of these things could be avoided.<br>

<br>
I am deeply, deeply offended.  Are you trying to say that because I choose not to use physical violence against a fellow human being, that I am a coward?  If I am a coward, does that make the people committing these horrendous acts of violence brave?  Who is really brave, the unarmed person facing the armed person, or the armed person facing the unarmed?  I'm not a pacifist because I am a coward.  I despise cowardice -- almost as much as I despise violence.  Is that clear?<br>
I pray that I am never in a situation where someone attacks my students.  But I will tell you right now that I would NOT BE RUNNING.  The first thing I would do is try to talk the armed attacker into putting the weapon away.  If I could not do this, I would request that he let the children go and take me as a hostage.  If he would not let the children go, I would request that he not harm them, but harm me instead.  And if he refused to do that, I'd try to block the bullet or knife with my own body.<br>
Children are precious.  That's why I'm a teacher.  I would rather die myself than let one of them be harmed.<br>

<br>
  In the US you carry a gun, and you justify it by saying &quot;I need it to protect myself against criminals&quot;<br>
<br>
  In NZ we don't carry guns, and we justify it by saying &quot;Our police force will protect us against criminals&quot;<br>
<br>
  Neither method is perfect... but we have a FAR lower incidence of violent crime with guns per capita here in NZ than you do in the US.  <br>
<br>
  Something to think about, yes?<br>
<br>
Cyrus<br>
<br>
  (Yeah, there are other factors as well.  It's not as cut and dried as the data would suggest... NZ doesn't have the same pressures that the US does, or the same opportunities for violence due to it's very low population density, and that's just off the top of my head.  Just thought it was interesting that from the viewpoint of a country that DOES regulate it's gun use, and ALSO has a heiritage of gun use, that the two are not mutually exclusive.  Please feel free to drown me out in a flood of rheoteric now).<br>

<br>
No I DO NOT want my children in a school where wigged out teachers are packing weapons.<br>
<br>
The mentality of todays parents boggle me.  I have a daughter, and when she was in 2nd grade she had a friend that wanted her to bring a knife to school, so her friend could stab a kindergardener. <br>
(&amp;*%^*(^&amp;%&amp;^%&amp;^%&amp;^%% I went off.  This was my baby! And that Kindergardener was someone's baby!<br>
<br>
Involved the school, the officer at the school, my daughter, my daughters' afterschool daycare center.  For a period of oh 3 months, I showed up at her school, at her daycare, and made sure this child, and mine, knew I would not tolerate any type of discriminatory, horrid, anti-social behavior.  I informed my daughter that someday someone might have something against her, blonde hair blue eyes, and how would she feel if they treated her that way.  The child that had become my daughter's friend was being raised by a single mother with gang affiliations, so I don't believe she got much direction at home.  This is what our children have to deal with EVERY SINGLE FREAKIN DAY.<br>
<br>
No I don't believe that guns should be banned from those individuals that have proven themselves competent enough to use and maintain them.  However, I am for a waiting period and background check.  If you've been proven manic depresive, paranoid, convicted of a violent offense, it'd be wise not to arm these people.  True these people can get a gun through blackmarket, but it does make it a bit more difficult for them.  Stricter laws on dealers, and more innovative safety devices for legal guns in the home.  Crackdowns on blackmarket dealers. Step by step possibly we'll see a decrease in accidental shootings, and the mentally ill or morally depraved getting thier hands on a loaded gun....or is that just wishful thinking ::sigh:: <p><Center><IMG SRC="http://www.lof.ukhq.co.uk/sigs/belgar.jpg"><BR><IT>
