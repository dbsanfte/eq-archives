Yet while looking for some sort of outlet for thier rage have turned this into a &quot;Wich Hunt&quot;. Then targeted a freind of mine, as a face they could put to a login an anonmyous login.<br>

I Hope you all enjoy randomly pouring over your hatred, and pointing fingers at people, and now entier guilds.<br>
<br>
I shall enter my old state of lurking this board.  (which BTW is how I saw this, not by any statment you made on our guild page.  which I did not see, and will not read)<br>

And for you Raedwulf I have enven changed my auto sig to a more fitting quote.<br>

<br>
I did not tell you how to live your life, I said here are two suggestions <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  (I mean this in the best possible sense).<br>
<br>
As for why do Christians all think we need Jesus in our lives? <br>
<br>
I cannot speak for all Christians, that would be horridly presumptuous, however I will give you my belief.<br>
<br>
Answer:  <br>
<br>
1) Because we all do need Jesus!  We all need the love and hope that Jesus gives us.  And I mean unconditional love.  Love that will never change, never leave you, never betray you, never let you down.  No human on this earth can ever provide that.  I personally, wanted and needed that love in my life, and I have found it.  I have been a Christian since age 15, but I was not walking with God for many years until recently.  I am so glad I am back on track, my life has much more hope and meaning now.<br>
<br>
I also personally believe that all people need that, but that is my belief, and I will not thrust it upon anyone.  I will, however, always try to show you that there is a choice!  We were given free will.  You can choose Jesus or you can refuse him.  You do have that option.  I would not want to be without Him.  If you do, that is your choice.<br>
<br>
2)  The second reason we all (meaning Christians) speak of this is that it was a command of Jesus himself.  He basically commands us to witness to the world and show you that there IS a choice here that you can make.  Speaking for the Christians that I know, myself included, it is a great joy to share the gospel.  No, I do not force it upon those who do not want to hear it, no I am not perfect, yes I make msitakes and basically am like all other humans in this world.  But I have the love of Christ and He does comfort me, and of course I would wish that for any and every person.  All I ever desire is the opportunity to show someone the choice.  It is always their decision.  <br>
<br>
Again, I do not speak for all Christians.  Only for myself, though I am sure some agree with me.  Some do not. <br>
<br>
Someone also, I do not remember who, said something along the lines that this is Mythology.  I do not agree and in fact there is quite a bit of scientific and historical evidence that is non-biblical that documents this.  However, yes, many people have different God(s).  Whether all Gods are God (meaning one) is obviously a reliogious debate which I have netiher the knowledge nor desire to discuss here.  However, I do know of many sources to which I can point you or people whom study this if anyone desires more information on the scientific and historical evidence.  I am not a scholar in this area.<br>
<br>
Now, I shall not speak further on this subject at this time.  This is not a religious board or one in which I wish to cause a religious debate of any kind.  This is my personal belief.  It does not need to be yours.  However, it is my opinion, and as such I expressed it <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
If you or anyone else wants to discuss it further, feel free to email me and we can go into more detail.  As stated before though, I don't believe this is the appropriate place for a spam on this subject.  Though from my long long post, I kinda am breaking my own edict (sorry about that).<br>
<br>
Btw, I'll add you to my prayer list tonight.   /smile<br>

Got your name wrong.  Sue me.  I'm more of a troublemaker than Mors?  What a bunch of crap!  Your continued trivializing and rationalizing of his comments make you seem even more complicit in his conduct.<br>
<br>
I didn't come to your board and flame you and Umbrae, I just let your guild know you both were saying things over here that were embarassing to them.  Not a flame, and I stand by it.  If I had the misfortune of being associated with you, I'd be embarassed.<br>
<br>
I didn't choose a random thread on your board.  I simply posted in the public forum there in order to get the attention of your guild members in the most active such thread.  You and they can argue they weren't justifying your comments, but the fact that all they claimed was that you weren't Mors, something they couldn't possibly know for certain, suggests their lockstep response was without thought or inspection.  It is intriguing that they've failed to address the fact that you've agreed with Mors initial comments, and even taken it further.<br>
<br>
Nope, not gonna leave anyone's guild out of this.  If you are pathetic enough to try and lessen the gravity of this situation with your sick sense of humor, then I will hold it against anyone that would continue to condone your conduct and associate with you.  They're bad decision to stand by you under these circumstances is beyond foolish. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uraedwulf.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Raedwulf</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 274<br> <font color=#E9D756>(9/13/01 8:12:21 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=139.topic&index=86>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Damnit</span><hr size=1> Umb:  &quot;Simple logic?&quot;  Where's something logical in your statements in support of Ibiar?

&quot;...one of those fucking crossbred Afghanistans...&quot; <br>
<br>
I think there is A LOT of hatred in that statement as well as bigotry.  I've felt a ton of anger coming through these posts. The &quot;fuck you&quot; this and the &quot;fuck you&quot; that.  Can't anyone find another word to express themselves with? When I use language like, to this day (I'm an adult in my 30's) my mother says &quot;Only unintelligent people use language like that.&quot;  There are so many other words we can use that will actually make people stop and think!!! &quot;Fuck you&quot; will only get a &quot;Whatever&quot;.   We are all saddened and affected by the events of Tuesday. We have all lost a lot! Innoncence for one thing - Brothers and Sisters, by the thousands, for another.<br>
<br>
If only we could redirect this anger and put it into something more worth while, like Tolerance.<br>

No one needs jesus. He's a figment of your imagination. He doesnt give you shit, you give it to yourself. Religion is about finding &quot;god&quot; in yourself. If your soul is so weak that you must find love in someone else?  HE DOESN'T GIVE THAT TO YOU. If you have it, than he didnt give it to you.<br>
<br>
You found love in jesus? I found love my girl. Ive been a agnostic since i was born. Ive been walking with myself for a long time. It has more hope..you gave yourself that..jesus didnt. Did jesus save everyone in NYC?  dont think so.<br>
<br>
People dont need jesus, they can live on their own with no subconcious jedi mind shit.  I dont refuse jeebus, I just have no purpose for him. If im in a building that gets hit by a plane...im gonna die whether or not im a celibate god loving pope, or a gay fag using a baby jesus buttplug from <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://divine-interventions.com/">divine-interventions.com/</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--> <br>
<br>
Jesus commanded you to come here and tell us to be christian?  RIIIIIIGHT!  What is the great joy in going to a church where an old man who doesnt get any pussy is telling you how to live your life. He then tells you that your going to hell unless you give 20% of your income to the church so they can build a bigger church? Thats retarded. Granted there are some churches that give their collection to the needy...those churches kick ass, but the rest are a pile of bullshit. <br>
<br>
Christ doesnt comfort you. What about all the Jews, satanists, Islams, etc who live fine.  Jeebus doesnt comfort them...The comes the better question...what about the starving Christians. You claim jesus watches out for you, comforts you, etc yet there are starving lil children who are jesus freak, yet people who deny god eat better than them.   What keeps you comfortable is in your brain...you think jesus loves you, and if thats the function that makes you feel special..then yippee for you..but jesus is dead. The Jews kicked his ass, and you should be thanking them for creating your fucking religion. Damn jews...created a cult...<br>
<br>
For those that agree with you...they're better than you...they didnt post about it. <br>
<br>
<br>
Dont add him to your prayer list, while your at it, why the hell do you pray? &quot;Oh Jesus, look after those victims families in this time of need&quot;  I bet thats on half of yalls prayer list these last few nights...What about the millions around the world who are suffering everynight...did you pray for them for the past however many years?  Did it work? Are they still on the street? Instead of praying for the families why dont you work an extra hour or however long you pray/goto church and donate them some money, they are gonna need it. Also, if you have to pray...pray that the victims died quickly and were resolute with their lives.......blah blah blah<br>
<br>
BTW....Not everyone makes msitakes....we make mistakes<br>
<br>
Ya know what..the best form of population control is the back alley, a big black man, and a coat hanger...<br>

I feel so sorry for you!  You obviously don't know what you are talking about.  I am not even going to comment on your ignorant reply - however, I do have a couple suggestions.<br>
<br>
1)  Read more carefully.  I never mentioned my religion.  Jesus is not a religion.  Catholicism is a religion.  Protestant is a religion.  Where did I ever mention my religion?  I don't always believe in religion.  Religion is a man made thing not that of God.  If you were actually informed you would have learned this/  /shrug.  Don't confuse the two.  Being &quot;religious&quot; does not mean you actually believe.  <br>
<br>
<br>
2)  Don't presume to think that just because you haven't found peace and don't believe in anything, that I have created some type of fictional reality for myself in my brain to &quot;feel special&quot; as you put it.  You cannot know what I think or feel.  Just I cannot know what you think or feel.  I found my hope in Christ, if you do not, then that is your choice.  And make no msitake (mistake - I did that just for you) it is a choice.<br>
<br>
3)  Read some scripture befire you  attempt to quote it or interpret it.  You, quite frankly, did not understand what I wrote.  Yes, Jesus did command it.  Go study the bible, even if it is for the agnostic sense of proving me wrong in your own brain.  Then come back when you have more biblical knowledge.  (Btw, I do not mean this to rebuke you, just to calmly let you know that you need to understand and be knowledgable about something in order to debate it, otherwise your arguments are completely without thought and basically resemble something that comes out of the hind quarters of a donkey - hot air).  (Well ok maybe not hot air, but you get the point).<br>
<br>
Mors, I am not coming back to this board.  If you really want the answers to your questions like where was God when the planes crashed, I challenge you to email me.  I would happily answer any questions you have that I can, and refer your question to those more knowledgable when I cannot.  My email is posted on my ezboard profile.  Whether you agree with me or not, that is your choice.  However, I do advise you to at least investigate the available information before spouting off about something you have not studied.<br>
<br>
Besides I believe what I believe.  You are not going to change that.  I am not trying to change your belief.  I am not attacking your belief.  However, I know I am going to heaven when I die.  Can you say where you will be and believe it with certainty?  If so, fine.  Good Luck.  <br>
<br>
Btw, it never says you have to give 20% or you go to hell.  Like I said, study and understand before you attempt to debate on something like this.<br>
<br>
Lukaria<br>
<br>
Btw, yes I do pray for all those in need every night.  And yes, there are specifc groups that pray for the things you mentoned.  I suspect however, that doesn't make you happy.  I put Seann on my prayer list because I want him to investigate and decide for himself.<br>
<br>
Oh and btw, God and Jesus are one.  Did you know that?  Study it and maybe you will.<br>
<br>
Goodbye.  Wont talk to you again unless you email me.  MAke sure if you do that it is actually well thought out and not meaningless.  Chatter is very confusing.<br>
