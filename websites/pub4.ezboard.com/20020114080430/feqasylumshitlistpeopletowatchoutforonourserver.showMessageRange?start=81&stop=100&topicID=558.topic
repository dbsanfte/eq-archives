<br>
I, for one, think you should just give it back, and work to repair your reputation. The longer that weapon is in your hands, the worse people will think of you. To be perfectly frank, (and who doesn't want to be Frank? He's a cool motherfucker), I think it will be a long, long time before you're trusted by anyone. And that's if you really make an attempt at fixing this.<br>
<br>
As it is, you didn't score any points with me when I noticed on Malden's website o' doom that you were chatting it up with him while he was training the Spectres around the Oasis zone.<br>

I go into oasis and see that Lum is there, so in OOC i ask him if he has resolved his situation and then all hell broke loose. Everyone in the zone starting in on him. I felt a little bad until he said that he was getting the 4k together. I asked him why he just doesn't give the item back and then he replied &quot;Because then I lose&quot;<br>
<br>
WTF is he losing?????? I said wouldn't you be regaining some of your integrity back??? He responded by saying that would never happen.<br>
<br>
Oh well I see now why this guy is such an ass. How hard is it to just give the frigging thing back???<br>
<br>
What an idiot. Needless to say I was real happy that everyone in the zone was giving him a hard time. <p>Enstoleburr Greyhawk<br>

Apparently he and Brash have talked and he would be happy with the money. So for now I would like to ask that everyone please give him the benefit of the doubt and not harrass him wherever he goes.<br>
<br>
I really appreciate how all of you are standing up for one of my favorite people in the game, but harrassing him furthure doesn't fix the situation. Lets wait and see what Lumi does then we can decide how to hand it from here forward.  If he does what he says he's going to do then he has proven that he wants to fix things. If he does not then he will probably be up here for quite a while. In either case there is no need to /ooc him in whatever zone he is in if ya don't like him. Just dont group with him, and trust that most ppl read what is posted here on the boards. <p>Eshtara Le'Gaia

Troll Thief and Liar.</span><hr size=1>     Luminesence, in your last post you seemed confused on why people are reacting the way thay are; are treating you the way they do. What I don't think you realize is that this incident involves more then you, or Brashear, or the Weapon; in fact, it goes way beyond all of that.<br>
<br>
    This whole incident involves Trust, which is a concern and a fear to any person playing. You have to trust the people you Group with, Talk to, and conduct Trades with. And at times, it has to be blind trust. You want to trust this person, but have no real reason to, and you are worried you will get burned. Because, lets face it: No one wants to be the victim.<br>
<br>
    Despite if you think what you did was right or wrong, in the eyes of Brashear, his friends, the Chosen Council, and the people pf Norrath; you have betrayed that Trust. To further that, your seemingly callous and uncaring attitude has only damned you further. <br>
<br>
    You have struck a very sensitive nerve amoung the community; and have volunteered yourself as a target to focus their fear and anger. And now, that Weapon has become your &quot;Scarlet Letter&quot;; and a calling card for the comminuty for future ridicule and harassment. And everyday that you keep that weapon, is another day that will ensure a public cry for justice.<br>
<br>
    Despite the justification, these are the facts. The reaction you are witnessing is a message to you; and anyone else that considers simular behavior. The message is this: This type of behavior will not be condoned or tolerated.<br>
<br>
    My personal recommendation to you is this: Return the Weapon to Brashear and apologize, to him and him alone. If you cannot, then pay him his Platinum immeadately. The longer you keep the weapon the further you damage your reputation; and confrim the fact that you cannot be trusted, and your word is worthless. The community will not forget, or forgive until you do.<br>
<br>
    If you truely wish redemption, the &quot;love&quot; you spoke of, then you need to prove that you can be trusted. Unfortuantely, Bad deeds are remembered longer then Good ones, and it will take a long time (if ever) for people to change their opinion of you. But perhaps, if you begin with caring and selfless acts within the game; and are sincere in your actions, perhaps peoples attitudes will change. But don't count on it anytime soon.  <br>
     <br>
 I hope you consider what I have said, and do the right thing. <br>

You cant lose what dosent even belong to you. You deserve everything you get, you truly do. And btw I am pleased I upset ya, I must have hit a truth you dont like to think about. The reason I said you parents are lacking is because even 4 yr olds usually have more compassion and sense of social skills than you do. They know enough to value people over things. You make it painfully obvious your parents taught you NOTHING! They both should have thought seriously about not attempting to try and parent, the result is simply to hideous and here we all are. Already I see comments from people dismissing you as a complete waste of human skin. You prove that your apology is so fake when recently you refer to Brashear as some dumb guy you got wurmslayer from. And of course the fact that you havent returned it says you arent sorry at all, and that lame comment &quot;but then I lose&quot; is stupid. It isnt yours to lose firstly, and secondly are you too dumb to see how much you have already lost?

What day did you steal the wurmslayer?  And goodness I see armour in that SS of you that Worthy took.  Are you telling me you got all that stuff in that one day of begging?  And those weapons you are selling in Obnoxious' SS?  Did you get those begging also?  Or did you steal them too?  It amazes me you say you had nothing that day you begged from me.<br>
  You are the liar Luminescence!  You step in it more and more each time you open your mouth.  Just give back the wurmslayer, you will never be able to save enough money as you will never see another group.<br>
  You may save a yourself a shred of a decency if you give it back. <p><img src="http://www.cyberarmor.net/images/sigs/garnette.jpg"></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ugarnettewolfury.showPublicProfile?language=EN>garnetteWolfury</A> at: 6/6/01 6:09:57 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uigottomuchgameforyou.showPublicProfile?language=EN>igottomuchgameforyou</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>p0\/\/3r-p0sT3r!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(6/6/01 6:59:04 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Luminescence.

The group leader said he was gonna invite him, I alerted him to the fact that said was all over the shit list for duping a guy out of a wurmslayer.  Promptly the group leader returned to group looking for tanks 19ish.

Troll Thief and Liar.</span><hr size=1> Lum... I have been reading this post for a while and since I don't know you personally I can only judge you by what you have written here.  From what I have read you are a person who gets his/her enjoyment from arguing with others.  You have expressed many ideas and then the next day turn around and say something totally opposite of what you said the day before.  So I have a few questions for you.<br>
<br>
<br>
1. You say you have play the patience and kindness game before and always had it ruined by someone else.  Well... you taking the StaminaSlayer (TM)  from the person and not paying for it isn't the least bit wrong in your book?  You are ruining the game for someone else.  You stated that you apologized to the person you took it from thus you have to think what you did was wrong or you wouldn't need to apologize.  Does another wrong make a right?<br>
<br>
2. You say you want people to stop hating you, but yet you say you don't care what they think of you and verbally attack people on the board.  Let's be honest.... Do you really care what your fellow gamers think of you?<br>
<br>
3.  You said if people like you didn't exsist... what kind of people do you mean?  I am guessing since many of the people was calling you a &quot;ass&quot; (yourself included) that this is what you meant by &quot;people like me.&quot;  I will tell you if there wasn't assholes out there... this world would be a better place.  Don't you think so?<br>
<br>
I like to know a little about the people I group with in game and I like to trust some of these people as friends and know they can be counted on when I need their help.  From what you have showed me thus far is that you can't really be trusted as a player.  And from what I can tell not many people that have heard about you and what you did would care to have anything to do with you in the future.  True you can always make another character, but how long till this kind of thing happens again and you ruin that character's reputation... or you may not.  It's your choice what you do and how you do it.  But as long as you act the way you do now... you'll not be grouping with me with Lum.<br>
<br>
My advice to everyone else is to keep letting his actions speak for himself and to ignore him as long as he acts this way...  He is only doing this for the attention and as long as no one is paying him that attention he will have less fun and hopefully re-think what he is doing or move on.<br>

Troll, THief  amd Liar. And he cheated me !!! </span><hr size=1> Oki he realy are a scum bag....<br>
<br>
I was running thru oasis and saved a Trolls life. His name was Luminescense, he was so low on HP and would have died if i didnt have helped him. <br>
<br>
THere he was standing with a WURMY and almost full suit of crafted. He was asking how kind of sword i had and i said Yak and Crystalized. He was asking the price and i gave it to him. He asked to see crystalized and i put it in the trade window. He was putting 792 sp there. Stupid me ( me tupid norwegian girl) thought that was 792 PP andthat is a awesome price for a crystalized. so i was thiinking, oki let the lowlvl troll have it and i can sit in EC and buy a new one. I pushed the trade button...<br>
<br>
So suddenly i understand what a stupid girl i was. i had sold the sword for 792 SP. <br>
<br>
/bonk Bedory<br>
<br>
I was asking him to redo the trade. The answear was no, it wasnt his fault that i was so stupid. We had a long discussion. Suddenly i saw him at docks. He was dieing again, i thought i had to save his life, if not im sure the redo of the traid would fail.<br>
<br>
So again i saved his butt.... He still didnt want to redo. So there i stod without a second sword and only 100pp. So i thoughti  could offer the 100pp for buying the sword hje had got for 7 pp.<br>
<br>
Nope he didnt.... but if i gave him my crafted vambraces and bracers, and my piercer pluss my belt. he would be nice to me and redo the traid he said.<br>
<br>
After a long discussion and talking about this list (saved his life one more time) we did  a trade with all my 100pp my piercer and belt.<br>
<br>
After that i heard from guild that he was a well known scammer. And i heard about the wurmy. i asked him if he regulary scammed people, and he was answear yes to that. I lied to get that wurmy !! he said (logged that ).<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
So stay out of this bastard. Let him not have any fun time in Norrath. He is now located in LOIO, tell your guildis NOT to group with him. No  one shall give this stupid trool a change to survive !!<br>
<br>
Looking forward to freeze this bastard out...<br>
<br>
