<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> The US did crush Japan... resoundingly...<br>
<br>
165,000 US troops died fighting Japan... 1.1 million Japanese troops died fighting the US... US Navy was 5600 warships strong in 1941(and the largest navy on the face of the earth)... the Pearl Harbor fleet was a very tiny portion of the US Pacific Fleet... it was 46,400 warships strong in 1945 ... larger than all the worlds Navy's combined... twice as many as the rest of the world... Japan lost 3 times as many planes... 4 times as many ships... 8 times as many troops... civilian casualties 10,000x plus...<br>
<br>
Japan was utterly wasted by the end of WWII... if thats not a crushing... I dont know what is.. even without the Atomic Bomb... the US totally crushed the Japanese Empire... had we never bombed the Japanese mainland, Japan was so weakened and without the resources to rebuild... unlike the US that was able to triple the size of its navy in a single year by 1942... in 1943.. it had tripled again and the Naval battles by 1944 were so lopsided, that Japan's navy was confined to its own original waters to fight a last stand at Okinawa<br>
<br>
The North African US troops were said to have lacked training... for N. Africa... not for combat... even as untrained as some might suggest... the US troops in Africa WHOOPED the superior forces of the Germans.. untrained??? I dont think so.. they were a little unprepared for the territory and weather... but they learned very quickly... The British there had been there, trained there, for hundreds of years... the US got there and in a few months learned desert warfare... and were praised for their military prowess in the ensueing battles... the were the elite forces on D-Day... battle hardened from Africa<br>
<br>
Germany's Navy was tiny to begin with, and its losses to the US Navy, not even counting its losses to the British, was a 25 to 1 ratio... The US Navy creamated any German naval confrontation... as did the British... The Italian Navy was even smaller and even less effective. IN 1942-1945... the US picked off any German sub that dared to leave the Baltic Sea... All known german subs in the Pacific were sank to the last...<br>
<br>
For arguments sake, say Germany and Japan had both bordered the US... in 1939 when WWII was actually considered a war, if they had invaded with the military they had on hand. Japan would've lost its entire navy within months. Germany's within weeks if not days. Allowing our Navy to surround and bombard the hell out of them within the first few days of the invasion.... Our Air Force by 1941 was larger than both Japans and Germany's combined... Our Ability to rebuild military hardware exceeded Japan and Germany's combined by a huge factor... It certainly would've been drastically more costly to the US.. Germany's tanks would have been difficult to defend against... no argument there... as our tanks were so much smaller and less deadly... but our Air force was extremely effective in taking out german tanks.. even before we developed the p51<br>
<br>
N. Africa was proof that our smaller tanks, against larger German forces, could win... Patton was no genius.. but he was effective... Rommel was a genius... and had alot of power to fight with... but the US prevailed against superior odds... against superior tanks<br>
<br>
The US lost 130,000 troops fighting Germany... and killed 800,000 german troops... We lost half what the german's did in aircraft... we destroyed 3 tanks of theirs for every one of ours they destroyed... I think we did pretty good against Germany.. especially considering we did it on their turf.. the advantage goes to the defender...<br>
<br>
Russia killed 1.4 million german troops... but they lost 13.1 million... best trained???? NOT... The russians were being pushed back and held at Stalingrad... but they werent able to hold it, until the US supplied them... once their troops had guns, they were able to stop the German advance, with the help of a second Winter... and the US invasion of Anzio... Once the US was in Europe on land... the Russians were able to rally, being that the Germans pulled 450,000 troops from the Russian Front to reinforce against the US, British and Canadian's push into Europe.<br>
<br>
The US sat outside of Berlin, waiting for the Russian's to get there, so that per treaty, the Russian's could march into Berlin first... they sat there for 3 days, taking casualties so that the Russian Army could regain some pride.... Russia did not liberate any country until after D-Day... and not until Romania conceded to the US and joined the Allies for the second time. After that, Russia was able to push the Germans back, then conquer Hungary. Finland, who was at war with Russia at this time, though not as part of the Axis, conceded a ceasefire and withdrew from the war.<br>
<br>
Only 4 nations killed more troops than they lost.. US, Britain, Germany and Japan... between those 4... the US killed far more Germans and Japanese.. Britain retains a positive score here as well, but not as lopsidedly as the US does...<br>
<br>
History measures Germany's strength by how it was able to conquer nations like Poland, who's army hardly even had guns... they rolled over the Netherlands, whose army was 1/100th the size of the Germans... they beat France... who was considered the strongest army on the face of the planet at the time... in 1939... in 1940... Germany was recognized as strongest.. ... by 1941... the US showed who was really the strongest... Germany's strength is misleading.. given their opponents... its easier in hindsight to see germany was not all that strong... in hindsight, America amazed the world with its ability to regenerate from damage... While Japan was losing planes and ships faster than they could produce them... the US was producing ships and planes faster than they could lose them... in fact, in many instances.. we overbuilt... post WWII we had alot of excess hardware<br>
<br>
Attrition plays a huge part in war... back then anyways... and Attrition was our friend back then... I cant remember who it was, but someone of some importance from the Axis, that survived.. commented that the US was like a Hydra... every head you cut off, two sprung to take its place...<br>
<br>
Another example of how not strong as we thought germany was... 250,000 german troops invaded and held Norway... then a couple years later in 1944... 30,000 Norwegians routed that 250,000 German army right off their pennisula... while we can make excuses, such as most of that german army was green, and the Norse were battle hardened... it stands as another example of the truth of the german army strength.<br>
<br>
As strong as germany was... they crushed Poland very quickly... they killed 9 polish to every 1 german soldier killed in 2 weeks... but 90% of the polish army was equiped with a bladed weapon and hand muskets for firearms... go figure germany won... But back then.. people were ohmigod... I cant believe they beat poland so quickly... but when you learn the Poles had no guns... it makes alot more sense.<br>
<br>
Anyways... its all heresay... but given what did occur... and what each nation had in its power, considering all the factors... I very much believe the US could've beaten Germany and Japan by themselves... at great cost though.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ulurikeen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lurikeen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 169<br> <font color=#E9D756>(12/31/01 10:17:30 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=258.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: WWII and American Contributions in Europe.</span><hr size=1> Andmunn,<br>

I don't know what you are discussing on the &quot;other board&quot; but what do you think is being said in the long nationalistic posting you provide?<br>
<br>
Personally, I find it distastefull, such as the following line:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> &quot;Russia killed 1.4 million german troops... but they lost 13.1 million... best trained???? NOT...&quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Are we Americans supposed to feel proud that we fragged 800,000 Germans and lost only 110,000 troops when compared to the millions of lives lost by the Russians? It sickens me that some even entertain such obvious nationalistic bullshit. I think we US citizens have much to be proud of and don't need to tout our strengths against the losses of other less fortunate countries. <br>
<br>
Rather than claim our superiority in the face of the suffering of our other WWII allies I would have liked to have read a tribute to the millions of Russian allied with the US to wipe out Nazi Germany. It is obvious (according to the post you provide) that the Russians made the ultimate sacrafice when they could have simply surrendered to the Nazis claiming they were &quot;untrained&quot; and not able to fight. Instead, they were brave warriors willing to die to protect their homeland against the Nazis. My two coppers. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>Lurikeen Mali'Kyre<BR>

There is the link to the board. Perhaps you'd like to add your own input. I've been very fascinated in WWII, however, i need to comment when anyone makes statements (in that post) like &quot;we owe our freedom&quot; to one country in particular.<br>
