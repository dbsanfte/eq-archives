<br>
<font color=fff00>Why spend hours upon hours of leveling up to get the same exact excitment you can get from owning in a match of CTF or TF with your clan.</font><br>
<br>
I don’t think it’s the same as CTF or TF in that those are closed environments, always the same and very confined in their own respect. Its easy to learn the maps, they really aren't that big. Imagine a game of CTF or TF on a battlefield the size of West Karana (with lots more trees, hills, forts/keeps), that’s about one-third the size of the frontiers[PvP zones].<br>
<br>
When you login to a game of CTF or TF, both sides know the objective, what the other team is fielding(number of people) and exactly when the fight will start. In a battle of RvR, you have no idea if 10 players are invading you or 100 until you actually get in there, nor do you know when they’re coming. As the invader, you have no idea if you are about to take a fort completely by surprise (with zero player defenses) or if there are 20 Archers just waiting to take your head off when you get in range.<br>
<br>
<font color=fff00>will a GM be there to watch all the battles and award the people who showed the most skill a prize? will random items drop when a battle has been won? will a NPC spawn once the war is over that the winners can only engage that drops loot? how will people be rewarded other then some cheesy point system?</font><br>
<br>
If you're going to purchase Luclin, then you're diving into a ‘cheesy points system’ even more than you’ve been for the past 2 years. You’ll be able to trade your exp[read: cheesy points] for additional skills. What is gear? Gear is a series of items that enhance your stats, both primary and resist. Its all cheesy points, it’s always been.<br>
<br>
In RvR you accumulate Realm Points for killing people(you even get a point for being killed, participation is rewarded), these realm points can then be ‘traded-in’ for things just like in EQ(at least I think, no RP rewards were in beta). The way RPs were explained since the get-go was, people who participate in PvP will be better than those that don’t, the points can be turned into character enhancing abilities or additional stats. Everyone who PvP’s has the same ability to reap the rewards, not just people who win a /random or it was their day in the loot rotation.<br>
<br>
<font color=fff00>I see no end game, therefore to put days and days and days into leveling is futile</font><br>
<br>
End game is in the hands of the players for the most part, its what we make of it. Unlike the AI associated with big dragons, Dain or Tormax, players have the ability to alter tactics at the blink of an eye – we can think. A strategy that let you take a keep in 5 minutes today might get you wiped out in 2 minutes tomorrow, its not a nerf its player tactics and that makes for a more interesting end game to me any day. <p><b>Vendrix</b><br>

<br>
The expected end-game is taking over forts and relics from other realms.  One realm invading another realm and defending your own realm from invaders.  <br>

<br>
It's not quite the same as a FPS.  In a FPS it's more of who sees who first and gets off the shots.  In RvR it will usually be more than one person, usually a group, taking on other groups.  This leads to groups working better together at a team and less reaction time.<br>

<br>
If you go into DAoC expecting loot for all your time, you should stick to EQ.  Most of the good loot is player made, and you can buy pretty good items from merchants.  There are mob dropped items that are good, but not nearly as many as in EQ.  <br>
<br>
I guess you could consider forts and relics as loot.  Relics give bonuses to your realm if you control them.  However if you are looking for mobs to require alot of PCs to kill just for loot, I would stick to EQ.  There are a few places(zones) in which mobs require more than one group, but those places are not common.<br>
<br>
The realm points are the &quot;end-game&quot; rewards in DAoC.  Not all the rewards for realm points have been added, but Mythic stated that a player who participates in RvR(and gains RPs) will be more powerful than someone who does not.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> I see no end game, therefore to put days and days and days into leveling is futile.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
You can't really compare DAoC's end-game to EQ.  EQ is based on getting loot and killing the same mob over and over again.  Tactics don't really change, so after your 3rd or 4th killing of a mob does it get tiring?  Apparently you don't think your 100+ days leveling to kill the same mob over and over again was futile, so maybe others will not think DAoC leveling is futile.  In DAoC the enemy AI will be constantly evolving their tactics because you are playing against actual humans.<br>
<br>
EQ and DAoC are concentrating on different gamers, and it's hard to compare the aspects.  If you are looking at getting loot by killing mobs, in turn making killing those mobs easier next time they pop, then EQ is still the game for you.  DAoC is more for people who enjoy ever changing challenges.  RvR battles that change everytime you participate, rewards being less loot-centered(forts, relics, RPs).<br>

1.)  You can't see the names of people in other reams.<br>
<br>
2.)  If they somehow found eachother on the battlefield and decided to repeatedly kill each other, I suppose it's possible.  But the 15 minute run from the nearest bind point to the battlefield would make it pretty tedious.<br>

<br>
The only reason I talked about loot in my post to the extent that I did, was because loot was a big part of your post.  Loot from RvR, GM giving out loot, mobs spawning after RvR for loot, ect.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> I dont wanna play a game where Mythic dangles this carrot about how much of a blast RvR PvP is suppose to be in front of my face just to find out it is a big crock of shit. if I put 2 years(like EQ) of my life into a game I want something back for what I have put in. I say loot cuz that is the easiest way to distinguish between someone who has put time into a game and who hasent. I really like the idea of trading in RPs for stats and skills, I will have to keep up with friends on how that developes. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I'm not sure what all the rewards for RP will be in DAoC.  The way I see it is this, what has kept you in EQ was the loot.  You kill a mob and get some loot, wait X days and kill the mob again, repeat until you have all the loot you want.  <br>
<br>
In DAoC you will kill PCs in other realms for RPs.  After you accumulate a certain number of RPs you get X as a reward.  It has been stated that people who PvP, and get X, Y and Z from RPs, will be more powerful than those that don't.  <br>
<br>
Loot is not as important in DAoC, but there are other things that do reward you for playing/putting in the time.  You will receive bonuses for RPs, not loot, but still something that shows who has put in time vs. who has not.<br>
<br>
As far as putting 2 years into DAoC to find out it sucks, that won't happen.  If you powerlevel in DAoC, like in EQ, you will be high level in a month or two, in which you can personally try RvR and see if it is fun, or boring. <br>
<br>
Hope that helps with what I was trying to say.  You know all the aspects of EQ, so I was just trying to explain the aspects of DAoC.  Some people will still enjoy EQ, and not care for DAoC at all, others will do the opposite.  You can't please everyone all the time.<br>
