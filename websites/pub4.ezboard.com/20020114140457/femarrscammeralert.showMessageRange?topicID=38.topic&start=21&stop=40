I was with a few of my guild Insurrection in MM.. Pig-R-us was in the zone.. when he saw all of us there he asked to join our guild.. right away.. I did what I normaly do and refered him to one of our officers..  as a joke realy.. and he was busy I guess he asked us to group him and see what this guy was like.  We invited him to a group and was playing with him..  later in the castle as we faught.. and there was a standing order on randoms.. he said that the Black Claok mob spawned and ask us to go kill it.. a 55 shaman that was with us.. siad sure Ill go with ya.. the rest were medin.. they killed it with no prob.. he looted.. and never said anything about randoming it.. in guild says.. we discussed his attitude.. and we decided he was a putz.. one of the members there even said watch him log now.. and low and behold he said &quot; I have to log for a while.. the bitch.. (my mom) is yelling at me&quot; when I saw him later I told him that he would never be a part of our guild and that if he ever needed any assistance from us he should consider it no help..  he asked why I felt this way.. I told him that he basically ninja looted from us.. he siad that no one in the group could use the Hooded Black Claok.. I was playing a monk at the time.. and the item is ALL/ALL so there was a lie..  he then said please please blah blah balh.. I told him your on ignore now..  later I saw him again.. and he said I'm realy sorry about what happened and he stated that he &quot;deleted&quot; the hodded cloak.. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    anyway.. he needed a res then.. to which I did not res him..   It is my thought that this player is a low teens person and has no concern for anyone other then himslef.. so in closing and dealings with him should be at a HIGH RISK..<br>

After a while we dicided to let him group with us. He led us into the secret passage next to the graveyard with no warning at all led us downstairs. Our whole party was feared and raped. Right after he asked us to help him get HIS corpse when he got us killed. No warning of what was downstairs b4 we went down. Hope hes learned his ways! but form what i see he hasnt.

The simple reason is that Im competing for the person most likely to dual Pidnus today and win.<br>
<br>
Ive now clocked up a stunning 7 victories over him cos I just cant resist the &quot;Pidnus has challenged you to a duel&quot; message as he does when I tell him what a freak he is.<br>
<br>
It goes like this. I was in Highkeep at level 34. My group were fighting in the warrior room and Pidnus being level 39 at the time was soloing the guard room. The server had just come back online after a patch and we were quick to our camp. So was Pidnus. However several minutes later the zone began to fill which is when the low 20s that usually camp the room started to form up. Pidnus stated that the 6 of them would have to wait till he was done. He mentioned he would be done fairly soon as he only had 3 bubbles in this level to go.<br>
<br>
I immediately petitioned him because in my opinion 6 good people shouldt wait for several hours whilst one takes a room he is far too high for. The gm concurred and Pidnus was told to move on. The 20s took over the guard room.<br>
<br>
Pidnus then annouced in shout &quot;Warrior room...dont worry about the stair spawn. I have it now.&quot; My group were not worried. We were quite looking forward to it spawning again.<br>
<br>
After 3 Pidnus KS's and me giving him as many verbal warnings I told him in no uncertain terms what he could do with himself. He gave a lot of agro and I petitioned him again for the use of profanity and KSing. Then after 30 mins of no Gm response I issued my first EVER duel. Pidnus told me I was a &quot;fucking coward&quot; to issue a duel with a full group to back me up. He walked off.<br>
<br>
I went back to fighting and after a few room spawns I was down to less then 2 bubbles of health. Which is when the level 39 pidnus accepted the duel and started laying in to me. My group who were engaged in a large fight at the time unilaterally told me to break off and waste the little sod.<br>
<br>
Given my low health I used my lay hands and proceeded to smack hi around some. Despite the 5 level difference I dished him some major damage after rooting him and blinding him. I dont even think he saw me long enough to hit me.<br>
<br>
At the end of the fight Pidnus ran. I tried to root him in full spawn but to no avail..he ran away to the guards where he waited till he had fully healed. I remember having lost no more than 1 bubble and all in all I was a little miffed Id used my lay hands.<br>
<br>
Pidnus then called his friends to lend him two yaks and a fbss. He came back down again no less than 4 times in what can only be desribed as uber gear. He'd borrowed it all to beat me. All times he waited till I was at half health or less. Finally a root held for a decent length of time and I blinded hiim and finished him off. Multiple cheers went off from round the zone. Pidnsu came back to loot his corpse and issued a second duel. I saw no point. He then proceeded to swear and scream that Id had a complete heal of my group (er..lay hands dickhead) and that I was using unfair tactics (flash of light)He did some KSing and then a gm turned up. Pidnus received his first soulmark.<br>
<br>
Several times since then Pidnus has claimed spawns that have previoulsy been taken. He has attempted to form a second group to take Sol Bs pool room and as a result Ive accepted that duel far too many times. Not once have I lost. Every time he screams I cheat. 2 days later he wants another go.<br>
<br>
He is now with League of Omisan and I hear a lot of comments that all his guild are the same as him and that theyre all cowards and cheats. I strongly doubt this. I have no experience with the League and I can only think that their poor reputation comes from counting Pidnus as one of their number. <br>

I had a huge rant on him months ago and I still remember why I wrote the damn thing.<br>
<br>
Several months ago my guild was dong a Mistmoore raid for the sole purpose of getting me some Granite for my armor quests (my guild is awesome like that).  My guild was assembling outside when all of a sudden I get &quot;Pidnus is inspecting you&quot; followed shortly by &quot;Pidnus has accepted you to a duel to the death.&quot;  I decline because he's anon and run into Mistmoore.  He sends me a tell a bit later and asks why I didn't duel him and I told him that I don't duel anon people.  He gives the typical LOL response and I go on my merry way with my guild.  <br>
<br>
We then were in the jail area when the Avenging Catiff (or whatever) spawned, my friend Thistlecrown goes up to make the trade for his EBW when out of nowhere Pidnus runs up and starts to attack the thing.  We shout and ask him to stop but he kills the thing anyway.  He then runs off and proceeds to train Mistmoore...  Five times...<br>
<br>
Next day he's in Crushbone offering to Powerlevel people for 50pp per half hour session (I was trying to finish a silly Paladin Quest that was totally useless to me but I wanted to do it).<br>
<br>
A month or so goes by and he asks to join our guild...  We laugh at him and go our way.  <p>Islington Angelwatch <br>

He usd to be in Tunares Guards but he quite.  Still disapointed we didn't get the chance to give him the boot.  Basicly he had decided to sell me Crested MM Shield for 300pp over guildsay.  Later he decided to try to get more money out of it and backed out of the deal.  Not a realy big deal but I was not overly happy.  Well after letting him know he was being rude to a fellow guildmate he decide to go through with the trade.  A few minutes later he gave me a tell that he was not going to sell me the shield and did I think he was doing the right thing.  Well I took it back into guildsay and told him no.  At this point he began cursing in tell and quite the Guild.  Needless to say he was on ignore and we were rid of him.  Thanks to Boldershoulder a few days late I had a Crested MM Shiled given to me because I did not have the 300pp on me.  So just beware of Pidnus.<br>

Has he seen this page? Can someone kindly point him to it? Can someone also point Zule his new guildleader here so he can see it. Ive yet to see him online.<br>
<br>
He did it again. I was in Sol B Pool Room this weekend when in walks the aformentioned loser and starts killing mobs. The first thing I have to say is they con green to you , you coward. The risk is minimal, the reward the same, yet its what you do cos you cant solo anything blue, your ineptitude being bigger than your attitude. <br>
<br>
So I asked you very nicely didnt I? Despite all our past disagreements I said &quot;Pidnus these are our mobs, could you please %^&amp; )(&amp;&quot; Yet all you do is move off into one of the adjoining rooms ( which is all part of the same camp ) and start again. It wasn't my fault you got petitioned, its just a by-product of you being an arsehole.<br>
<br>
Then, listen to this folks, he runs into the PR with a mob on his tail and less than 1/2 a bubble of life screaming &quot;HEAL ME. HEAL ME&quot; So heres what I do for you Pidnus.<br>
<br>

Pidnus at this time is dotted by a shaman and I still refuse to heal him. I just walk away, yet Pidnus starts by telling me &quot;PALADIN...HEAL ME.&quot; Constaspam. Guess what....I dont heal him.<br>
<br>
Sliver of life left and luckily he gets away with it, im still rolling round on the floor laughing myself silly. At this point he sends me a tell &quot;Your reputation is ruined&quot; Of cousre I repeat it to the zone and it gets a lot of laughs.<br>
<br>
I then spoke to a member of Arcana to ask for their leaders name as he's joined them. After a few requests to different members I get a reply. Zule leads Arcana. Two minutes later I get a tell from Pidnus so Zule, if you see this take note.<br>
<br>
Pidnus tells you 'So you want to speak to my guildleader do you, go ahead he's my real life friend and he doesn't care what I do. Ill take what I want'<br>
<br>
As I say Ive not spoken to Zule so please don't think of him harshly on this.<br>
<br>
Finally after bugging Derrit in the Window Room for a while KSing mobs again he goes to Qeynos.<br>
<br>
5 hours later and Im in the King Room when he does it again. He tries to KS the king who we managed to agro back onto us. It dropped a RMB that otherwise he would have got. He then does this <br>
<br>
Pidnus shouts 'Is Efreeti taken?'<br>
3 seconds passes <br>
Pidnus shouts ' Efreeti is now officially camped..I am taking it'<br>
Grisel shouts 'We're in Efreeti you prick' (or words to that effect) <br>
Pidnus shouts ' You didnt answer so Im taking it now. Leave the room'<br>
<br>
Ask Grisel about this if you will.<br>
<br>
Zule, I will speak to you in game. If Pidnus is right and you support him in this then my estimation of Arcana drops. If you dont support him, then please be aware, hes been kicked out of more guilds then anyone can count. They see his attitude a few times and boot him. If this is an attmept to take him in despite his past grievances in attempt to change him then good on you but please note that he isnt changing much irritating a full zone again. As I say I have no grievances with you or your guild and all that Ive met have been polite and competent. Pidnus is neither. Hes about as wanted on E Marr as a fart in a space suit.<br>
<br>
If people think I started the entire incident please read my earlier post and think why Id be a little tired of him.<br>

I responded to Pidnus's little efreeti /ooc as yes, we were working our way to efreeti ATM. ( or something along those lines),And i missed Grisels claim on efreeti, i barely caught what Pidnus said during the fight we were in. And then Roark mentioned what a real peice of work Pidnus was.Then poor grisel(sp?) comes barreling by with all his new Imp Protector friends, which really ruined our day. We died several times that day, mostly due to the bad packetloss that was happening. As i understand it Grisel was trained by someone and was trying to make it out alive , so not trying to shit on him .<br>
Anyway , i just wanted to add some veracity to what Kerryn was saying. Pidnus, you are a sad, sad little man.<br>

He offered some junk for an FBSS I was auctioning for plat and wouldnt take no for an answer.  He kept putting the junk in my trade window although I didnt want it and couldnt use it but he insisted it was worth big plat.  No one I have ever grouped with will group with him and mentioning his name draws so many bad responses I cant believe it.  How can someone have generated this much ill will? I think he has achieved 'Legendary' status and must be recognized as such.<br>

When I saw Grisel, then the bat room fill with hella mobs I assumed the worst of him (made the assumption that he was grouped with Pid). <br>
<br>
In any event, if you are reading this Grisel, I apologize. I didn't take any of this to /ooc or /shout, nor did I even send you a tell but nonetheless, I made a premature assumption on your character and an incorrect one at that.<br>

<br>
i was in mistmoore when he ninja'd the cloak<br>
<br>
i seen the group message that he had looted it and felt a sharp pain right away<br>
<br>
but i said in group wooot!<br>
<br>
i mean this was a guild raid and we had told him all items are going to guild unless no one needs then well random with you<br>
<br>
we told him this because he had followed us for 45 minutes litterally begging to join and was causing us more harm out of group<br>
<br>
<br>
so anyway i was all stoked because i was prolly gonna get a chance at the roll and was all happy<br>
<br>
i say come to random it<br>
<br>
no answer<br>
<br>
i ask zeppo where he is and he says he is outside the castle<br>
<br>
i send pid a tell<br>
<br>
no answer<br>
<br>
<br>
he made it outside the castle then guess what<br>
<br>
<br>
pidnus has gone linkdead<br>
<br>
<br>
i petitioned and spoke with a gm and we waited for him to log back on<br>
<br>
<br>
he did 30 minutes later<br>
<br>
<br>
gm talks to him and he says since we were all gone he figured that we thought he was trying to steal it ( he was instructed not to loot)  so he &quot;destroyed it&quot;<br>
<br>
lil scum sucker got his way with us that day<br>
<br>
but his level means he is running out of new faces<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
oh one other thing he did<br>
<br>
<br>
warrior buddy of mine is standing around<br>
<br>
he comes up and says &quot; i got this new (insert ranger  weapon here) and wanna see how it does... will you duel me then ill camp&quot;<br>
<br>
warrior buddy has almost no gear on because he is selling stuff<br>
<br>
they were both same level.... 35<br>
<br>
well warrior with no gear is no match for a ranger kiting him<br>
<br>
im getting tells from the warrior near the end and go to find him and im too late as he dies to a dot<br>
<br>
fucking ranger snare kited him and warrior didnt think a thing until he got low and all the prick did was dot him<br>
