YOU CAN'T CLAIM CAMP ON A FFA MOB! is this concept so hard to understand?</font><br>
	<br>
Verant also enforces a PNP policy that basically says we all have to share spawns and camps because there are no real "camps", meaning that if I want to take a group to camp village in velks when it's already camped I CAN!  But, fortunatly, we still have respect and understanding (for the most part on our server) so that we dont have to work like that.<br>
<br>
<font color=yellow>My guild may or may not have the same attitude i do on this subject. I don't know, i haven't asked them. and didn't realize that my voice all of a sudden represented my whole guild.... i didn't give up my individuality when i joined them.</font><br>
<br>
You seem to be setting the guidelines and rules of conduct for our server, whats so bad about assuming that you speak on behalf of your guild?  You say you are an individual... well individually you believe that this is a FFA mob and the people who "camp" it deserve no respect... I individually hope that you realize that the people with the attitude such as yours are the reason why this "quest" is so painful and difficult to complete.<br>
	<br>
<font color=yellow>now... by your "claiming camp" stupidity... you are actually making the RF spawn 10 times harder and more wasteful than it actually needs to be. You are making clerics sit there for 6 days for no reason.</font><br>
<br>
Let me repeat... the people with the attitude such as yours are the reason why this "quest" is so painful and difficult to complete.<br>
	<br>
I sat for 3 days, I have had friends who sat for 5-6 days, and I can say that by doing such they proved themselves worthy of their epics as compared to someone who prances in and claims "FFA!".  I honestly cant say that I would have wanted it any other way for myself, I would have felt very undeserving if I would have not made the effort that it took to complete my epic quest.  Not only that I can say that as frustrating as those days were, how tired I was, and how strung out I was after finally getting through it... it was the most fufilling thing I have ever done in game.  <br>
<br>
Aishen said it better than I could have possibly said it... "You see, even if a mob was FFA and I was fully in the right (according to the *unspoken* rules of the server regarding FFA) to gank the mob from some poor sap who's spent days camping that spawn, my conscience wouldn't forgive me".  <br>
<br>
Does that mean that how I did it was the right way?  No.  I just think it's the most rewarding.<br>
<br>
To me camping Ragefire is not stupid, to me it's a great way to spend time with your friends and guildmates (assuming you have any that will give their time and effort to see you through the period of time that you are there).  The reward of sitting through ragefire, for me, was not getting my epic... it was seeing just how damn wonderful my friends and my guild really are AND I got to see just how supportive other guilds and other clerics on our server can be.  <br>
<br>
As far as referring to my opinion (or anyone's for that matter) as stupid, I could say the same for you, however, Im not trying to be disrespectful, Im stating my opinion as you are yours.<br>
<br>
Like many people have said: it may be a FFA mob but a majority of the clerics on our server respect and treat the mob as a camp when a cleric takes the time and effort to "hold the camp".  To each his own, I dont think that you're opinion is wrong, I just honestly hope that if it comes down to you fighting over the mob with someone who's spent days in the zone waiting patiently that you make the best moral decision possible.<br>
<br>
I dont think the mob is difficult to obtain, unfortunatly you have people who are inconsiderate, uncompassionate, and disrespectful who decide to make it hard for those who actually believe that they will be able to make it through it like so many others have.   <p>Baroness Syldra Marlowe<br>High Priest ~ Affliction<p><font size=1>
It's probably wrong to believe there can be any limit to the horror which the human mind can experience.  On the contrary, it seems that some exponential effect begins to obtain as deeper and deeper darkness falls- as little as one may like to admit it, human experience tends, in a good many ways, to support the idea that when the nightmare grows black enough, horror spawns horror, one coincidental evil begets other, often more deliberate evils, until finally blackness seems to cover everything.

<br>
Just another opinion of mine is this... <br>
<br>
I understand you're not representing your guild with your views on the camp, but this is something I have always been a firm believer in...<br>
<br>
Everything you say and do while you have your guild tag attached to your name reflects upon your guild as a whole.<br>
<br>
If and when you get your ragefire how you go about it will reflect upon you as a player and your guild.<br>
<br>
The number of guilds and clerics who came to SF while I was "camping" ragefire is almost astounding.  I had guilds come in numbers claiming that they would have no respect for Ragefire as a "camp" and that my time spent was irrelevant because the mob is "FFA", they changed their minds and backed down,  Whether it was because of their morals or because of other reasons it is something that I am still thankful for.  <br>
<br>
I had a cleric from PC parked at the spawn for hours upon hours on the final night of my camp who's intentions were unknown to me at the time.  It kept me on my toes and suprisingly enough when Ragefire spawned I was posed no threat by this cleric, he simply offered his help for the fight.  <br>
<br>
Its amazing how much respect a player and a guild can earn by being kind and respectful to their fellow players no matter how easy it is to be selfish and greedy.  Keep that in mind too.<br>

Why, because someone that has days to blow sitting in front of a tv screen has more of a right to a mob over someone that had the forthought and knowledge to time it? Sounds pretty silly to me.<br>
<br>
Like I said, anyone can camp it. But its only really camped if they have the force there to kill it. <br>
<br>
Arguing about the sematics of one person calling it a camp? heh, one persone does not equal a camp against a mob of that size, it equals a scout. They are not there to solo it, they are there so they know when to call in friends and guildies.<br>
<br>
You want to waste time arguing about it, go ahead. But that is how it stands. Ragefire is a FFA mob now under verant rules and its how the server as a whole recognizes it.<br>

<br>
So if a cleric has 6 people total in SF and they claim it as a camp its ok?<br>
<br>
Or 8?<br>
<br>
Or 12?<br>
<br>
Or would a cleric need to have 30-40 people present at the time?<br>
<br>
If I had 2 groups of people sitting with me in SF and I claimed it as a camp would you respect it any differently?  From the sounds of it... no.<br>
<br>
FFA = it doesnt matter who's there: first to engage, first to have the force, whoever gets the kill... everyone's opinion of FFA can vary in some way or another.  Same with what justifies one being able to call it a camp.<br>
<br>
<font color=yellow>So other then them moving the spawn has anything changed other then the fact people have forgot were all here to play a game, we all have things we want, and we dont all have to screw each other over to achieve those things....? </font><br>
<br>
Tokum brings out an argument that brings a whole new twist onto things... what does make it any different now other than the accessibility of the mob?  Nothing... all the greedy people are now just given an excuse to call FFA and step on toes because its easier to do so.  It's always been FFA (according to Verant's rules) just moving it made players lose the morals and respect that we at one point of time had for one another. <p>Baroness Syldra Marlowe<br>High Priest ~ Affliction<p><font size=1>

I see the free for all mob point. What the server has done to Ragefire has made it just to a point that its always going to be the bane of every clerics existance. Its nice you got your epic an you had friends their to help you. I also know that clerics have stepped away from that spawn even their with the force to kill it. While others would come in an gank it with one group.<br>
<br>
Really its not a matter of right an wrong. Its a matter of a persons choice. Personally I would never gank someone else but that is just me. Shrug<br>
<br>
I take what people say an I leave what people say based on my opinions an dealings with them.<br>
<br>
I know one thing though. EVERYONE will ALWAYS fight over this stupid dragon til VERANT changes it again. Maybe if we spam feedback it can get changed YET AGAIN.<br>

<br>
No, some of our server still respects it as a camp, so saying "the server as a whole" see's it as FFA is innacurate.<br>
<br>
There is no such thing as a "camp" period, ANYWHERE, however, on our server we still do "camp checks" and we respect people who are in one perticular place for one perticular purpose (in most cases).  Perhaps you'll remember this the next time you're in CT camping sewers and another group sets up across from you and tells you they have just as much right to be there as you and "its FFA" because, well, it is.<br>
<br>
Verant didnt set up rotations on our server for Trak and VS, our server did.  Will Verant force a guild to follow in the guidelines of the rotations that we have made?  I doubt it.<br>
<br>
Verant has a PNP policy, they support FFA, does NOT mean that everyone on our server agrees to it and that we all believe it is the right way to do it and it does not mean that it's the way our guilds function or how people on our server as individuals choose to behave.<br>

It's probably wrong to believe there can be any limit to the horror which the human mind can experience.  On the contrary, it seems that some exponential effect begins to obtain as deeper and deeper darkness falls- as little as one may like to admit it, human experience tends, in a good many ways, to support the idea that when the nightmare grows black enough, horror spawns horror, one coincidental evil begets other, often more deliberate evils, until finally blackness seems to cover everything.

<br>
 You can call the RF spawn what you want, but from what I have seen most people on this server respect it as a camp if someone has been sitting there for days on end. I'm really impressed that the larger guilds usually try to help that person.<br>
<br>
Whoever feels like it is more than welcome to come in and yank it from that person, but the majority of people on this server will help that person should RF spawn rather than try to take it from them.<br>
<br>
In Verant's eyes, yes its FFA but most people on this server are good hearted. If I didn't already have the cleric epic, I would be one of those sitting there trying to claim the camp because I know that most people still respect it as a camp and would help me should RF spawn rather than coming in and taking over.<br>

You had to clear the Fire Giants as soon as they popped and you had to get help to do that.<br>
<br>
Now you don't. You can sit there on your ass and claim you're doing Ragefire and hope that the people you need are online when he pops.<br>
<br>
Most of the &quot;KSings&quot; that have happened as of late have been exactly this. People sat on their asses claiming the Ragefire camp, and being there for RF's spawn. At this point they say /gu RF popped. Can I get some help please? and their is silence.<br>
<br>
They do a /who GUILD all and get about 4 members online at that time.<br>
<br>
The opposing guild that gets there does a /who &quot;campers guild&quot; all and see those 4 members and think &quot;Sod this&quot; and they attack.<br>
<br>
So the camper watches as another cleric completes their epic, possibly gets a little bitter and argues with the opposing guild, then they go back to their camp, all hard done by, hoping that next time RF pops there are forces online that will get there.<br>
<br>
Although it's not nice that someone posts that they've been KSed 5 times it kind of signifies that that guild is not ready to have an extra epic at that moment.<br>
<br>
There were talks for Ragefire and the idea of a camp and rotation fell through. To say that most people wanted a rotation is incorrect. Most wanted it FFA but said they would respect a rotation. This is not the same thing.<br>
<br>
Because of that it remains a FFA mob. As Aishen say's some people respect that camp and that's great, but some guilds have decided that they either cannot or will not camp in SF 24 hours a day for 7 days and that they will engage if nobody else has. <p><CENTER><A HREF="http://ak.lonelygamer.com">

It shouldnt be a matter of "the spawns up fvck everyone lets get the kill before anyone else can!" <br>
<br>
There is no right/wrong way, there is no solution.  Clearly its going to come down to personal prefferance and morals.  <br>
<br>
If a cleric has camped the spawn for 3 days and the mob spawns and they CANNOT get enough to fight then they're put in the position when they should "give up" their camp but no one should "TRY" to take it away from them.<br>

<br>
Using that belief, whoever spawns him, owns him. And the first person to spawn him, owns him.<br>
<br>
However, the reality is a little different.<br>
<br>
Yes, whoever spawns him, owns him. And yes that is first come first serve...<br>
<br>
But the real question is who has the right to spawn him?<br>
<br>
It is simple common courtesy and respect, really. If someone has gone through the trouble to have the spawnpoint watched 24/7 for days on end, they should be given reasonable time to gather the force and spawn him.<br>
<br>
First group there with sufficient force is BS. Ragefire is a frustrating camp and running over someone who has to put in more effort because they are in a less organized or smaller guild or because he spawns during their guilds off hours is incredibly rude.<br>
<br>
Likewise if you are camping him and when he spawns you know you have no hopes of gathering sufficient force for many many hours, pass on it to someone who can.<br>
<br>
Common Courtesy and respect. Period.<br>

We all know who the guilds are that KS Ragefire, it's pointless to point fingers and shout &quot;You SUCK&quot;, perhaps if people had some damn respect for each other this camp/FFA spawn (whatever) might not be such a trauma.<br>
<br>
The people getting shafted by this FFA attitude are the smaller guilds, you know the type I mean, you see one of thier clerics sat there and do a /who all &lt;guildx&gt; and say 'jeez only 4 people online that means I can just bully in and take Ragefire when he spawns'. Any of you guys ever heard of a fine invention called a telephone? guess not. Some of the smaller guilds have to have a phone tree to wake members and get them online, or just plain get them to log. Sadly some people have such a bug up thier arse about getting 'thier' epic they forget that there's real people sat on the otherside of that avatar, and real people have real feelings and can be hurt by your actions.<br>
<br>
The least some of you guys can do is give the other cleric sat there chance to get thier people online and have a go at Ragefire.<br>
<br>
I think what would be a good thing would be to set up the Ragefire Anti-rotation thread, if a guild KS's RF, they get posted, then we can see who KSing guilds really are, lol even if we know most of them <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
