I think that we all deal with things in our own way...<br>
<br>
Many play now or for now to deal.. having a moment of any kind in game to show a unity is nice... If you would rather NOT be a part than fine.  For you to come in hare and say it is tasteless i do not agree with.  I am sure we have or could have lost friends (who were friends in game) in this horriffic event.  Why is it wrong to honor them in game?  If i recall there is a staff member for SOny/VI that has fmily missing.. <br>
<br>
How is this blending RL with VR??<br>
<br>
On the other end of that connection we are all humans and we all have feelings.. why should now be any different?<br>
<br>
<br>
I for one would love to give blood but for medical reasons my Dr. has siad it may not be good for me to do at this time.. I will as soon as i can.  My point being.. we all want to do something.. whatever it is.<br>
<br>
No act of kindness is too small.. or wrong. <p><font color=magenta>Fori Shadowmoon</font><P>

<br>
<br>
Give blood.<br>
<br>
But NOT for the next 3 months.  In a few months, when the hype dies down, the Blood Banks will be low as usual and calling in their few regular donors.  Much like anything else, out of sight and out of mind.  By that I mean that in a month or two people will be getting on with their lives and forgetting to donate.  Or coming up with reasons to not go down for the half hour it takes.<br>
<br>
So if you wanna help, do it.  But not for a while.  Make a real commitment.<br>

<br>
First off, my joke was OFF topic, read it again.  It had nothing to do with the topic, nor was it to make light of the topic, it was to give me and possibly another a smile after all this sadness.  You want to spend the rest of your life wallowing in depression because of what happened, go for it!  At least I don't call you &quot;sick fuck&quot; for doing so.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  I think the melding of real life and virtual reality is for sick fucks actually Dauragon. It was no joke. A reality check might show you this kind of shit is seriously twisted in most normal people's minds.

<br>
Who said because someone wanted to join hands with their friends across the world (since some of my friends are in different countries) through the use of a VR world is sick?  Why is it ok to come here and post what you think about it and not go out and write how you feel on a REAL message board.  But of course you have no problem with people posting their feelings of the event on this message board, you don't call them sick, even though this message board is just as Virtual as Norrath.<br>
Maybe you didn't realize that doing an in-game ceremony IS taking away time from PLAYING your character.  As I already stated, some of us HAVE gone to real-life ceremonies, read my posts.  Some wanted to do more.  I understand that you feel that a virtual character in a virtual world should not have anything to do with RL.  But if you realized that most people would only do something like this so they themselves can show respect with those they can't physically be with at this time, therefore simply using the character as a tool and the game as an arena.  Please lets not get into a debate of exactly HOW significant these ceremonies you speak of are and who they are significant to.<br>

<br>
What you call a bizarre kiddy parade to some is just a group of friends using the game as a medium to join together and not let the distance we live in real life be a barrier to us doing something together.  Don't worry, I won't have trouble forgetting you.<br>

<br>
Don't assume you know how sincere someone is in their gestures.  What makes you think you can just log off EQ and make money?  Not all of us are paid hourly and can earn overtime.  In fact, some of us have donated quite well.  <br>
<br>
How exactly is this &quot;toying&quot; with real-life issues?<br>
<br>
Think about people like this:<br>
<br>
You had given blood<br>
You had donated money<br>
You had visited ceremonies in your area<br>
<br>
Yet you wanted to be part of a ceremony with friends you can not physically be with, and the only avenue you have is EQ.  <br>
<br>

<br>
Lets see, go ahead and call me a &quot;sick fuck&quot; for thinking it was nice for someone to honor people.  What shall I call you for not reading and jumping to conclusions?<br>
<br>
I want you to quote me when I said *I* would hold a service?<br>
<br>
I will save you the time, I NEVER DID.<br>
<br>
Until you know how often I work, or how much money I earn, how much I donated or anything else about my real life, keep your pie-hole shut about it.<br>
<br>
I love how everyone comes here assuming people have not donated money or blood.  Is it too hard for your brains to concieve that people want to do more than you?<br>
