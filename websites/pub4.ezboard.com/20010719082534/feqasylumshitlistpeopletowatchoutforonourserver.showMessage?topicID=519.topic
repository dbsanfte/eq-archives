Not many times - and the time or two that I have - I was concerned with his constant wining in group say about either loot or xp, but dealt with it as understanding as I could be in that not all are the same, and I can understand for wanting return on investment of time.  But at the same time - someone that cares only for self (or so it seems) is a peave of mine.  Since this time or two - I have never grouped with him again - and if LFG I do not invite him to my groups - or if wanting to get in a group - I do not join his.<br>
<br>
Now - the case and reason for listing him here:<br>
<br>
Obviously Sebilis is becoming quite the crowded zone.  I mean - entrance looks like Karnor's castle.  There is much tention in securing camps and what not.<br>
<br>
So - here is the problem.  Disco Hall was open.  The cleric in our group called Dhall as did Seoken.  Common enough.  But the reality is this - that our full group was there and he was desperately trying to form one out of scratch.  He would shout 'Moving to disco hall as soon as we get one more' - 'Disco Hall looking for one more' and so forth and so on.<br>
<br>
So being a debated issue - and hello - the game truely is first come first serve in many ways - yes there is respect - and I respect others as well as others have respected me - but a contended camp spot with one group ready to move and the other still forming - we move out.<br>
<br>
We make it past the door - charge the 2 frogs at the top of the ramp ... and what to our suprise did we see ... Seoken blasting past us - full speed - <br>
<br>
Ok - a race - NO BIGGY.  He get's there first - he can have it.  I am one not to hold onto things - and those of you that know me on the server - know this to be true.<br>
<br>
BUT - instead of taking the mobs down by the rock - he TRAINS them back over us.  It was more than the 3 mobs at the rock too actually - i dunno - musta grabbed some from the bridge - but we got about 4-5 adds.  Chanter goes down - I go down - Wizard evacs rest of team - and I head back in.<br>
<br>
Seoken is FD and obviously I am upset - so I don't act in the most civil manner due to anger, and ooc what happened and the normal blah blah blah stuff starts.  So I shut it - cause I realize what I am personally doing - and is pointless.  Seoken /q out - and DOES not come back.<br>
<br>
So I invis to get past the shaman mobs - (thank goodness no wars were up) and drag bodies.  And not only did I find my body and the chanter's body - BUT alas - Cretain's body - who was in Seoken's group.<br>
<br>
Regardless of my feelings - I don't want peeps bodies laying all over seb - so I drag Cretain's body to the zone and get him rezed.<br>
<br>
Now - this might seem like day in day out - get over it stuff.  And forgive me if I seem presumtious about posting this here - but I have waited 2 days thinking and mulling this over.<br>
<br>
The reason I am listing Seoken is not cause we were racing to a camp - I understand that part of the game - and to be honest would have gladdly backed out if he had called and had a full group or a group on the way.<br>
<br>
The reason is this:<br>
<br>
A)  He blatently trained us to wipe us out.<br>
B)  And worse - he let his own team mate die - for his agenda.<br>
<br>
He never came back - for hours after that - and believe you me - i was / all seo periodically for awhile.<br>
<br>
Oh - here - even though Screenshots can be altered - let me show you a statement by Cretain - his group mate for the evening:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://home.kc.rr.com/istrahd/slist.jpg"><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>
<br>
Cretain apologized.  Thank you bro - apology accepted.  I feel sorry that Seoken led you to your doom without letting you know what was going on.<br>
<br>
Seoken - your actions in the past of selfish interest are very real to me.  And these 2 actions - training my team ON PURPOSE and worse - leaving someone you commited to be in a group with dead and not attempting to get their body summoned - or better yet - you dragging it cause you are a monk - solidified the fears I had about you.<br>
<br>
Can you change - I sure hope so.  Do you care?  I don't know.<br>
<br>
I did notice today that you are no longer guilded - and wonder what your old guild would have to say about you.<br>
<br>
Regardless - you are here.  And don't plan on getting a good remark from me to my friends for raids or groups.  I understand return on investment - but blatent selfishness - I have no room for. <p><center><Table width=550 border=0><tr><td valign=top align=center colspan=2><center><img src="http://www.kerinakreation.com/images/sigs/istsig.jpg" border=0 alt="Guild Leader of Dark Whispers"></center></td></tr><tr><td valign=top align=center><i><font color="red"><b>Istrahd V'Zarovich<b></i><br>58th Defiler<br>Dark Whispers<br></font></td><td valign=middle align=center><font size=-1><i>"I am The Ancient, I am The Land.

Anyhow, even if Istrahd had not given such a convincing account here, I cannot think highly of anyone that he would deem shitlist-worthy.  I don't think there's a more kind and forgiving person on the server than Ist, he gives necros a bad name. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

  One issue I would like to bring up though is that just because he isn't guilded doesn't necessarily make him a bad person.<br>
  I for one recently left a guild myself for personal reasons and I would almost guarantee that 90% of my old guild would speak very highly of me.  But I have to say that I have felt pretty self concious about not having a guild tag, exactly for the reason Im posting here.  Because people believe if your not guilded you are socially unacceptable.<br>

I agree - just because you are not guilded - does not make you a bad person.  BUT, when a person acts selfishly, and I see they don't have a guild tag over their head anymore, that makes me wonder.<br>
<br>
Adjani and Sinn, <br>
I believe the guild was RoTA if my memory serves me correct.  That said, please bear in mind - I am not making a statement on the guild at all but on the person and that my memory might not be correct on the tag (but I coulda swore that is what I saw when I was in Skyfire that one time). <p><center><Table width=550 border=0><tr><td valign=top align=center colspan=2><center><img src="http://www.kerinakreation.com/images/sigs/istsig.jpg" border=0 alt="Guild Leader of Dark Whispers"></center></td></tr><tr><td valign=top align=center><i><font color="red"><b>Istrahd V'Zarovich<b></i><br>58th Defiler<br>Dark Whispers<br></font></td><td valign=middle align=center><font size=-1><i>"I am The Ancient, I am The Land.

<br>
In his race to beat your group to the camp he could have messed up and aggroed. I find it highly unlikely that the couteous, selfless person I knew in EoN is capable if intentionally doing what your describing. Maybe it was just a mistake, and he just /qed out and didnt think want to log back on. If I knew that I would not have anything to do in Seb then I would not have logged back on. <br>

Bro - I didn't nec. intend my one post to make it permanant.  The point of the list is to report actions that are listable.  One instance.  Everyone has bad days - and if not supported by the community - it will be removed.  I am ok with it (it meaning the rules of the list).<br>
<br>
Youo,<br>
<br>
Bro - As I am your friend - then know my heart.  I don't usually cause a ruckess - and to be honest - as stated to Cidric - I am reporting a listable offence.  How do I know he trained me?  First is this - I am a fairly observant player.  In fact - I help chant a lot (sometimes too fast for a chanters taste) so I try to be aware of my surroundings.  Heck - if i see AOE stun not working on a mob or mez not sticking - I ST the thing or do something to piss it off at me - better me dead than the chanter.  So - I watched Seo run past me to the bugs - do a circle - and bring the bugs up to the steps.  Secondly - please note the graphic I posted - Cretain apologizes for the train.  He knows - cause he helped cause it - but didn't realize what his leader was leading him to do.  I mean - Cretain was abased that he was a part of something horrid.  So bro - that is how I know.<br>
<br>
I am willing to let by gones be by gones - heck - even though Venen doesn't play as much if at all anymore - you guys can recall the long list and stuff that was there.  In the end - Venen and I made peace.  It isn't that hard.<br>
<br>
BUT - I am going to report deliberate selfish acts that hurt other people.  Whether supported byt he community - or a one BAD day deal - time will tell - and if he is innocent - and just had a bad day - this post will be gone in a week. /shrug <p><center><Table width=550 border=0><tr><td valign=top align=center colspan=2><center><img src="http://www.kerinakreation.com/images/sigs/istsig.jpg" border=0 alt="Guild Leader of Dark Whispers"></center></td></tr><tr><td valign=top align=center><i><font color="red"><b>Istrahd V'Zarovich<b></i><br>58th Defiler<br>Dark Whispers<br></font></td><td valign=middle align=center><font size=-1><i>"I am The Ancient, I am The Land.

Oh, and don't go bashing the guildless, since I am in that state as well.  Basically the only guild I ever been in doesn't really exist any more.  Only alts with a few primaries are in it to keep it open for those that are still looking for a new home.  I however chose to leave and start looking for a new home without my old guild tag over my head.  Is that a crime?  It been about 1 1/2 months and still seems really weird to me. /sigh <p><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#FF00FF"><b><I>Tsulyra Shadowhawk</I></b></font><br>

Youoway: had nothing to do with his guildless state or the fact that he was looking for a new guild, just that his method for doing so was clearly in poor taste.  He posted cookie-cutter apps on several guilds sites each saying how much he liked the particular guild and how much he wanted to join, when it was clear he just wanted in a big guild without spending the time to get acquainted with members, learn how the guilds worked and pick one that suited his personality well.  Also, tool was supposed to = fool (was a typo <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ), and I would say it was indeed a foolish a way to try and gain entrance as is evident by the replies he received to his posts. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ubrambler.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Brambler</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://eqbrambler.homestead.com/files/3dlgowu2.jpg BORDER=0> at: 5/15/01 3:47:20 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/beqasylum.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=cidric>Cidric</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>h0x0r!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(5/15/01 2:36:00 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Seoken - Your selfishness reveals itself!</span><hr size=1> Istrahd,<br>

I was not implying anything on your part. I have seen many posts snowball with replies concerning non-relevent information. The post quickly lose focus and appear to be more of a Salem Witchhunt. <br>
<br>
There is a level of condemnation (and justly so) associated with the shitlist. These additions which add little to no real benefit to the post damn the person by volume. <br>
<br>
If there is additional information regarding this or other incidents, it should be added, but anything else should not be necessary. My intent on my first post was to give a clear perspective on why Seoken was Guildless.<br>
<br>
Hopefully, Seoken will get news of the posting here and reply in person.<br>

Istrahd is an extremely nice person from what I've seen and also fair minded.  As a matter of fact his entire guild is to be commended for their behavior.<br>

I was told today that this post was on here today and feel it's very unnecessary.  Ist, I cannot exactly remember what happened that day.. but I can clarify things here for you and everyone else because I was not at fault here.  <br>
<br>
That cleric and I both called the disco1 camp in Sebilis that day.  I don't know who had called it first, I thought I did, but could be wrong..anyway he sent me a tell saying whoever got a group ready first should take it.. I said &quot;ok&quot; and got my group members to head down.  We headed down behind another group(which was Ist's group) and stopped.  Someone in my group ran on ahead while the others stayed back, THAT person was the one who agroed several frogs over.  <br>
<br>
For that to happen was not my intention.  I believe we started to fight the mobs and a few people died in the other group.  I honestly don't remember much else like why I logged offline, but it certainly wasn't to avoid you Ist.  I wouldn't do such a thing as train a group intentionally and then log.  Your group got trained by accident, not by me I add, and I ask that you please not think any less of me because of it.  I hope this clears things up for you all and this post can be forgotten. Thanks.<br>
