I believe this is where Christians get into trouble because of the &quot;holier than though&quot; attitude.  Each Christian seems to know what is right and wrong and many times it is different.  That is why it is important to encourage people to read the Bible, pray to God, have a close, personal relationship with God and He will show them the way.

<br>
That is the exact watered down religion I hate.  Baptism is not in the eye of the beholder.  Baptism is what God says it is, or its just getting wet.<br>
<br>
God set down a law so no one have to wonder if they were saved.  He makes it clear how to be in a proper relationship with Him.  If someone is truly longing to follow his commands appropriately then they will follow His word.  He will not "convict them to be baptised" except through His Word.  <br>
<br>
Why would God inspire the Bible if He was going to go against what it says and create their own means of salvation?<br>
<br>
If you say God loves people so much that He will nullify His own laws then your god is a liar, but I know that MY God isn't.  Not only that but you are saying that God loves them enough to make an exception, but didn't love Jesus enough to spare Him from the cross.  Pretty vain if you ask me.<br>
<br>
When people don't want to change their sinful lives they pull out things like "Christians are hypocrites" or "dont judge me" or "they act holier than thou."  As if those stereotypes nullifies any true christian.<br>

<br>
Thats a nice theory but don't forget these verses:<br>
<br>
4 There is ONE body and ONE Spirit, just as also you were called in ONE hope of your calling;<br>
5 ONE Lord, ONE faith, ONE baptism,<br>
6 ONE God and Father of all who is over all and through all and in all.   (Ephesians 4:4-6, empahasis mine)<br>
<br>
There is one baptism.  The baptism described in scripture, which is not sprinkling.  Now if sprinkling was also okay then that would make 2 baptisms... or did I lose count?<br>
<br>
Now, if you don't believe in God then thats different.  I am not going to discuss the existence of God currently.  IF, however, you do believe in God then his desires are pretty clear. <p><table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" height="1">

<br>
You missed the point.  I asked for love from you, not doctrine.<br>
<br>
I'm don't think its worth it to argue about this subject.  <br>
<br>
But, I shall answer you this once.<br>
<br>
I do not agree with you on the subject of losing salvation, mostly because I already pointed out the main difference between our two beliefs - which comes right down to the issue of &quot;grace&quot;, what it is, and how it actually acts in our lives. <br>
<br>
Its pretty obvious that our respective churches/religions teach two different things on this and we both feel we are correct.  If you really want to know what I mean, read the book &quot;Walking in Victory.&quot;  Its a good description of walking according to the spirit (and btw includes lots of information from Paul <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  )<br>
<br>
As for baptism.  The bible also uses the phrases &quot;baptized into fire,&quot; &quot;baptized by the spirit .. through faith,&quot; and Jesus asks his disciples if they can undergo the same &quot;baptisim&quot; as Him when he goes to be tortured and crucified - I am pretty positive he wasn't talking about water there.  The word used for baptizing in the bible is actually &quot;baptizo&quot; and is used not only for the ritual of baptism but also for &quot;immersing someone into&quot; something.  You must look at the context of the passage in order to determine its usage.  <br>
<br>
I do know, however, of a few established religions who think  baptism is sufficient for salvation.  I, however, do not.  Like I said, I don't really think this is the place to argue this.  <br>
<br>
I do not agree with your view, it has been presented to me before, I've read the relevant scripture, and I've agreed with what I've been taught and what I had previously concluded.  This was something I did indeed look at, as it is a belief of my husband's best friend's gf - it has even caused a rift between them somewhat as she is very adament about this.  Of course, any other belief means her family isn't saved, so I am sure you can see the problem right away.<br>
<br>
Either way, I've been baptized so this argument is moot.<br>
<br>
I would greatly appreciate the love being shown now, not who is right.  We could argue this all darn day and honestly, I don't think we'd agree on it.  You are being much more literal than I, thats ok /shrug.  I am letting this go now.  If you want further discussion, feel free to email me.<br>
<br>

Would you clarify exactly what a Christian moralist (I think thats what you called it) is?  Otherwise, your post in which you use this is really really generalizing.  <br>

Sorry RL is way busy, give me a day or two and I'll get back and answer a couple questions, but speciifcally the one you asked me <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Don't know if you'll agree with me, but I'll give my point of view.<br>

<br>
Truthfully, I was obviously generalizing, but let me define the word for you.<br>
<br>
A Christian "Moralist" is one who is concerned with regulating the doctrinal beliefs others have concerning morals, or regulating what others think is "good".<br>
<br>
If I were to say that your system of beliefs concerning salvation were not true I would also be making a moral judgment against you. I would be saying that your system of beliefs are not good and that you are going to hell. <p>Lurikeen Mali'Kyre<BR>

<br>
You want love so I will give it to you, I will continue to point out your misuse of scripture.  Love does not stand back and watch someone go to hell.<br>
<br>
I have no desire to read your book "Walking in Victory" but you can feel free to support your opinion with scripture.  I haven't taken the time but I am working on a web page... so I am not saying you have to, but rather I don't care about some one else's book.  Scripture is my reference so if you want to recommend reading do it from there.  I don't say that to be harsh but rather because we have 2 opinions and I don't see a need to interject a third.<br>
<br>
<font color=yellow>I do know, however, of a few established religions who think baptism is sufficient for salvation. I, however, do not. Like I said, I don't really think this is the place to argue this. </font color><br>
<br>
Of course not.. there is much more involved but baptism is 100% essential.  Read Acts 22 and the account of Saul/Paul.  Notice how he is commanded to go and be baptized.  Recieving a visit and the spirit from Jesus wasn't even enough.<br>
<br>
Let me help here:<br>
<br>
<font color=red>Galatians 3:26-28</font color> - Baptized INTO Christ.<br>
<br>
<font color=red>Mark 16:15-16</font color>  15 He said to them, "Go into all the world and preach the good news to all creation 16 Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved, but whoever does not believe will be condemned. <br>
<br>
<font color=red>Romans 6:3-8</font color><br>
3 Or do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus have been baptized into His death?4 Therefore we have been buried with Him through baptism into death, in order that as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, so we too might walk in newness of life.5 For if we have become united with Him in the likeness of His death, certainly we shall be also in the likeness of His resurrection,6 knowing this,<br>
that our old self was crucified with Him, that our body of sin might be done away with, that we should no longer be slaves to sin;7 for he who has died is freed from sin.8 Now if we have died with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with Him<br>
<br>
<font color=red>1 John 5:7-8 </font color>  7 And it is the Spirit that beareth witness, because the Spirit is the truth. 8 For there are three who bear witness, the Spirit, and the water, and the blood: and the three agree in one.<br>
<br>
<font color=red>Acts 2:38 </font color>- Peter said to them, "Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ so that your sins may be forgiven; and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.<br>
<br>
+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+<br>
<br>
Can you read these and tell me where you get the idea that baptism is a nice thing to add but that it isn't necessary.<br>

<br>
This is exactly what I mean.  You disagree with someone and you go into &quot;attack mode&quot;.  My relationship with God is not your place to judge!  <br>
<br>
If baptism must be followed as it is in the Bible then I think we should all gather at the river!  <br>
<br>
I was baptised originally by sprinkling and then later chose (for myself through prayer) to be baptised by immersion.  I'm simply saying Cendan that it isn't your place to tell someone they aren't saved!  You are not the final judge and when Christians run around telling people they are going to Hell because they aren't doing things as &quot;Christians&quot; see fit, it is wrong!<br>
<br>
Share the good news!  I don't believe that includes judging.  <br>

<br>
So what about people on the Earth that are born in places that have never heard of the bible or anything of the sort (maybe not so much now a day, but like a few hundred years ago lets say, time doesn't matter to much)... <br>
<br>
They live their whole lives without ever hearing a single word of &quot;God&quot; or any type of religion.  They just live their lives.  They were never baptised or anything, because they have never even heard of it?<br>
<br>
Will they be &quot;saved&quot; as you would put it? <p>Tuan {Cupcakes} the Vicar</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ucendan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Cendan</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/image/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 515<br> <font color=#E9D756>(2/6/02 8:25:15 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=269.topic&index=150>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Expectations and consequences of God</span><hr size=1> Tealdare you are the only one missing the point.  I don't have to pass judgement, God already has.  If He says that something must be done to be saved then it must.<br>
<br>
So, let me get this straight.  You think we should teach people the gospel but then not tell them how to take what is offered?<br>
<br>
You think teaching the whole gospel is judging?  Read your new testament, people were constantly taught that baptised = saved, not baptised = unsaved.<br>
