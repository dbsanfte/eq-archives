<br>
Kills were easy.  We had a marvelous group of people for both raids everyone followed directions got the kills with ease.  <br>
<br>
But loot... of course there has always been bickering about how I reserve loot to minimum classes... but tonight was great not to many people had issues with that, few people decided not to come which was the best way to deal with it, so there were no problems with my loot rules in general.<br>
<br>
Vox dropped 1 Bag, 1 Bracer, 1 RBB, 1 horn... nothing anyone could really bitch about.<br>
<br>
Naggy dropped 2 books, 1 scale, 1 bag, 1 shield and one Prayers of Life... only had 2 pallys on the raid... had 2 bards 1 warrior.  Figured, hell, everyone will be happy this is damn good loot... BUT...<br>
<br>
Had someone bitching and pissing a fit that 2 books dropped and we only had 2 paladins there and that I wouldnt let their main roll on it since they decided to use an alt instead of their paladin... its not my fault you didnt bring your paladin.<br>
<br>
Had 3 monks rolling to trade in tink for Naggy bag (here's the HUGE issue)<br>
I did a /shout with the 3 monks in the order that they sent me tells... randomed it fast because I knew no other monks had a tink to trade...<br>
randomed it and # 1 came up... and I gave the bag to that monk... randomed the tink bag<br>
All of a sudden I get a tell saying "why didnt you call numbers" /em is confused so I say "I did, scroll up" then all of a sudden I have others saying I didnt.  However, it did go through on my screen so I did the shift up arrow enter to the /shout that I sent... went through again.<br>
<br>
So I asked others if they seen it everyone said no.  <br>
<br>
So anyway I explain that I did in fact /shout it and that Im sorry no one saw it.  However one person continued to bitch and rant in tells calling me a thief saying that I am stealing from people to give things to my friends bla bla bla<br>
<br>
I dont even know the monk that won, nor do I favor him over any other monk that was there.  So eventually I tell this guy to fuck off.<br>
<br>
Anyway... that pissed me off.  A guildee said that it was probably lag... and that was why it only went through on my screen.  So from now on I'll /shout it more than once just to make sure everyone sees it.  I do /shout the randoms (raider + #) more than once when there are more people (so no one misses the random) but in this case I knew there was no one else so I did it once and randomed just to be able to move on and go to the next time.<br>
<br>
I started Vox at 8pm est and it was after 6am est at this time... 1.  I wasnt in the mood to be bitched at and 2.  I wanted to get these raiders who had been there since BEFORE I logged on out of there.<br>
<br>
My other rant is that people always send tells harassing over what the loot was (since I dont announce it til everyone is res'd) and when you tell them this and they continue to spam it it pisses me off.  If Im not going to tell the entire raid wtf would I tell you?  <br>
<br>
Then even though you announce who can use the items and who can random the items they BEG and BEG to be in on the roll even when its not for their class... I hate beggars!<br>
<br>
Then you get people who demand and I mean DEMAND that their alts/mains or friends get to random on items EVEN if they werent there.  And when you say NO they get pissed or badger you to let them in on the roll thinking that if they beg enough they'll get their way.  Now the only exception to this would be "hey I want to play my warrior but since you need clerics I'll play my cleric if I can roll for my warrior instead" THEN an exception might be made.<br>
<br>
Then you have the winners who only roll to sell the items... and the others who get pissed at me for letting them roll.  A lot of people understand when I tell them "I dont know what they're going to do with the item if I say "if you're going to sell it dont roll" they're not going to say they intend to sell it... but a lot of people still get pissed at me because Im not godly enough to prevent this sort of thing.  All I can do is avoid these people on future raids... there's not much more I can do about it.  I cant deny someone a shot at the random just because someone ELSE says they are going to sell it and not use.<br>
<br>
Anyway... Im not saying "feel sorry for Jexi bla bla bla" Its something I choose to deal with... but perhaps some of these raiders will read this and realize what they are doing isnt cool.<br>
<br>
I'll continue doing the raids, I'll continue dealing with the assholes because its fun despite the annoyances.  Especially when tonight I was able to help get 3 people epic pieces.<br>
<br>
To all those wonderful people who have never done any of the above said things (and there are tons!)... I love you all /hugs<br>

You leavin the game to the Vultures then? Damn dude, I have  alot of respect for you , don't dissapoint me like that! We need more peops like you or the game can go to the dogs!<br>
<br>
 Jex, don't let em get you down. This kind of stuff happens all the time and it's not your fault. It is however part of the price you have to pay to be a leader, and heck you should know that better than I do. I have seen these kinds of problems in the game since the first successful Naggy raids. <br>
<br>
Guilds that are percieved as very tight have these issues. Don't go second guessing yourself and triple telling everyone everytime you do anything..that will lead you to think like Kerna! <br>
<br>
The more you bend tried and true principles to suit the greedy masses the less effective you become. Be consistant , and roll over these 'mistakes'. Personally I would have just resent the shout the first time anyone bitched. I would have then said &quot;Look this was shouted. Here is what I shouted.&quot; I would not have asked anyone if they heard it. Screw them I sent it! The fact that they did not see it is not my fault and the rules for the loot were clearly laid out in the beggining of the raid.<br>
<br>
Some adjustment may be neccesary(improvement is a consistant goal for me), when about to give the loot out you might shout the names of the people In the random or the decision and say &quot;going once&quot; &quot;going Twice&quot; or some such. Something like that was how a leader of the last raid I was in handled it and it helped make things clear. But, generally stick to your plan and be consistant in your actions. Reasonable People will have a hard time disagreeing with consistant fairness and adherance to your already laid out loot rules.<br>
And unreasonable people? Fuck em!<br>

<br>
Dragon raids are the lowest form of pickup raiding for the reasons that Jex describes.  The value of some of the loot is disproportionate to the difficulty of the mobs and the experience of the raiders.  And so you get whiners and loot whores and scammers.<br>
<br>
However, dragon raids are also the place where many players begin to build -- or destroy -- their reputations.  If someone is a pain in the ass on dragon raids, people will remember that.  If someone is helpful and competent, people will remember that, too.  In the long run, reputation will often be more important than any of the loot dropped by Naggy or Vox. <p>Sagemon Prayeth<BR>

If they're harassing you in /tells about wanting special treatment, call them out on it in public.  They'll get shouted down real quick.  Everyone wants to avoid the loot-whores anyway; way as well let people know who they are.<br>

Then take your own advice and don't fucking read it.  He has a problem with Jex's bitching, you have a problem with his bitching.  What's the difference? <p><a href=http://www.afflictionguild.com/profile.php?username=Carathos&charactername=Carathos>Carathos Ollathir<BR><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/bthedruidsgrove> 60th Druid<BR> <a href=http://www.afflictionguild.com/>~Affliction~</a>

<br>
Tell them to leave you the fuck alone and if they think the loot should have been done differently that they can lead their own fucking raid.  You can then proceed to leave them in the zone without a port out and exclude them from any raid you do thereafter.<br>
<br>
Also a neat touch if you're the mean sort.  Is when you DO host another raid that they sign up for, you can add their name to the roster and then just not bring them so they waste their entire day and have nothing to do <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
This should solve most of your problems <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>

Fuck off all of you. You don't like how Jex does her loot rules on her dragon raids, dont go, lead your  own and shut the fuck up.<br>
<br>
To Jex:<br>
<br>
I have an idea, Start recording peoples names that give you a raft of shit on your raids and post their names here. That way those of us that know and respect you can avoid those people in the regular day to day game. Maybe if people start having their names posted publicly and they are put out in the light as being the lowlife scumbag loot bitches they are they will begin to feel the shame they ought to. Or better yet Add to your loot rules that if you spam the loot randomer with whiny ass begging to roll, you will be dropped from any rolls.<br>
<br>
<br>
Selfish whiney ass loot wieasles suck.<br>
<br>
<br>
That is all<br>
