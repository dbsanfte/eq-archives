How's this stat for you-All our social programs combined from Aid to families with dependent childeren to school lunches to housing assistance amounts to 50 billion a year. That's roughly $415 a year from each person. $1.14 a day.  However each year corporations take nearly 170 billion in federal tax funded federal handouts. That's $1388 a year from each tax payer going to pay. Over three times the money &quot;wasted&quot; on welfare programs is dumped into CEO's laps to do with however they choose, and that stat was from '96 when there was a democrat in office.<br>
<br>
The average person who goes on welfare is on welfare two years total. They usually want to work. The welfare system was created to help people rise up from poverty, and I think it is a true testament to the vision the founders of America had. That America is a land of oppurtunity. The average welfare recepient will pay more in taxes than they ever took out. I wonder did Enron pay more in taxes than we are going to spend on there trial and on the unemployment we will have to pay there workers. Not to mentions all the perks and kickbacks Enron probably got as they had freinds in high places.Did the banks involved in the savings and loan scandal pay more than we paid to bail there ass out? <br>
<br>
BULLSHIT this is anything like welfare, this is the rich taking advantage of power. Welfare is the poor struggling to make something of themselves. The world once ran where the rich did not have to kickback anything to the poor, it is called feudalism. America was founded on the beliefs that wealth was something one worked for. The poor don't become wealthy off of welfare, but the rich become untoppleable when they are allowed to use there money to govern. <br>

To me each of these things are wrong .. I shouldnt have to pay my money to bail out the poor , or to give breaks to the rich corporations.. that said to me they are two sides of the same coin.. yes the corporation is the bigger heavier side , but nonetheless , the same thing to me .. <br>
<br>
On the thought that welfare is people struggling to make something out of themselves , I sure as heck dont see that living in Atlanta ... I see the people on welfare staying there and not trying to get jobs ect .. i am sure some do use it to get back on the track that they want to be on .. America is still a place where wealth was someting someone worked for , it always will be ... <br>
<br>
/shrug  i guess my views on all this is convaluted (sp) so i will just bow out of the conversation more than likely .. <br>

<br>
I am a Voltairien. A believer in the humanity, in the human kind. With his low and his high points.<br>
<br>
There are poor people. There was and there will be. Poorness, unemployement, living in the street IS NOT something you choose to do. Sure, there are a small percentage of people who like to live like that, but think a bit and you will agree with me that this is not a life to live like that.<br>
<br>
The same goes for people leaving with the help of welfare association or programm. Do you realy think that the majority of those people like to live like that?? Being told what to do, to look for a job, to beg for some money to feed the kids... Human being hate to beg. Again, a small percentage like that and take advantage of the system.<br>
<br>
History has a lot of exemples that welfare is a need for society. Capitalism and economy know that there will always be some part of the population who will need help from the society to live. This is a result of every economic-politic system. Even communism in his paradisiac form, the on we we will never see due to the human factor, would have those "poor souls". They can be monetary impaired, physicaly inadapted, mentally insufficient, etc. they will exist in every type of society.<br>
<br>
The rich HAVE to pay for the poor. In a way or in another. You, american people more than anyone else, leave by the christian principle. Those principle (which are good for some, but do not enter in this subject PLEASE) lead the human to think to his brother. To care of his akind.<br>
<br>
Love it or hate it, rich people rule the world. Those same people knows that if they let the poor ones thinks too much, they are in danger of a revolution and they DONT want that. Welfare will continue to exist for the sake of our society. Rich will continue to pay for the poor, just to be sure thay are still in the camp of the rich.<br>
<br>
Sad vision of the world, but, halas, true one. I dont like what I just explained, and I try to fight it in my own little way. Sure, I am realy happy to not be in the "poor" camp. Sure I am not a revolutionnary (teenage dreams wear off not so long ago), but I believe in humanity and I hope we can help our children to change for a better. <p><center><img src="http://members.rogers.com/stellarthief//nosfy01.jpg"><BR>Officer of The Phoenix Crusaders - Guild of Erollisi

One day you may break your leg and be unable to work for an extended period of time. In that time you will be happy for the welfare money you get.<br>

By they way before anyone starts telling me how they have insurance, any insurance policy will pay a percentage of your wages minus the state welfare, which they expect you to claim, adn you will because typically you get about half your normal salary. <p><CENTER><A HREF="http://ak.lonelygamer.com">

Well said my Swiss friend. We here in America tend to villify that which does not have a voice. When our countries figures for debt come up this year it will be environment, and social services which will inevetibly take the blame for our deficit. I'd gladly pay twice the price of the missiles we chuck by the dozens into the sand in the middle east to see a condor fly over head or a young woman leave an abusive marriage without fear of not having shelter or food for her infant daughter. The welfare system will never be totally destroyed. The big corporations want to villify it here in America to push towards there modified version called work-fare. They do it in Wisconsin. It is modern day indentured servitude. Big Business can hire these people at low wages and get a tax break for it. These people then get a gov't kickback. Then instead of hiring full time help they can lay-off these temporary employees and rehire from the pool. Another program similar is the new prison work programs. Companies can hire prisoners at twenty cents an hour to do work for them. Calling to make plane reservations, you may be talking to a rapist. In my opinion those jobs should go to qualified workers and they should get full pay.<br>

<br>
Ellie you must have noticed by now that I say things in a certain way to get<br>
attention. This issue is BIGGER that that, we dont have time to sort thru<br>
what I really mean. So I am just flat out telling you. <br>
<br>
Before 1972 when the EPA was established there were little or NO regs on industrial<br>
waste. Industry did NOT regulate itself in any way. They just moved if the heat<br>
from the locals was too much. It was cheaper to move that to clean it up.<br>
<br>
The whole idea of the super fund was to make it expensive NO MATTER WHERE YOU WERE. The locals were no longer the primary irritant. That way the companies<br>
could not economically blackmail a community into silence.<br>
<br>
Sure I dont like Republicans but I hardly hate Bush. I dont even know the man.<br>
So far every bill I have liked he has passed.  He has ALSO passed alot of bills<br>
that I didnt like. But he didnt do that alone. <br>
<br>
I used to work for Toro. In Windom MN. The public dump there is a superfund site.<br>
Because TORO dumped all that pretty green paint that they like on their lawnmowers into the site. It leaked into the ground water and started killing livestock. TORO was forced to pay for it by the EPA. Picking up and moving <br>
away from Windom would not have allowed them to escape. The cost was horrendous. The site is now certified as 'stable' (whatever the hell that is)<br>
<br>
Without the Superfund that would not have happened. Toro has EASY 11 major<br>
plants all over the USA. They would have just closed down the one in Windom<br>
and shifted production. That type of thing is what I am fighting here.<br>
<br>
So no I dont hate Shrub, I just think he is an idiot. The distinction is important.<br>
I DID hate Nixon.  My tag line is for ME not this issue.<br>

As for Ted Turner, as far as I can see he is on the side of the Right<br>

And as for Ted Turner being Right wing..dude what planet are you from?  Between him and Fonda you have Liberal to the power of 2.  It's only been about the past year that Hanoi jane has had a change of heart about the F*ed Up shit she pulled in Vietnam and has begun to make public statements saying she regrets being a stupid bitch.  You guys should read the text of Ted Turners public remarks he made regarding the Sept 11th attacks and how the terrorists were &quot;Brave&quot; and that the Bush was basically a dictator.  Pretty much summed up good ole Teddy claims we have no right to defend ourselves and that the Sept 11th attacks were justified and necessary.<br>

I'm not going get into the whole Democrat/Republican thing.  I don't care what party the president belongs to when it comes to this.  He could be the most liberal Democrat ever, and I'd be outraged.  Anyway, while Eltherion's point certianly does make a lot of sense abstractly, I think I know the difference.  The difference has to do with _choice_.<br>
The poor do not choose to be poor.  I am poor.  My total salary for the past tax year was under $4000.  Although I am not on welfare, many of the working poor need the help.<br>
However, the polluters knew what they were doing.  They chose to make these horrendous mistakes.  And now they want to get it all tidied away without paying?  Bullshit.  Their mistake, they should pay.<br>
Will I pay to have pollution cleaned up if I have to?  Of course I will; I want to leave my children a better world, one more liveable than this one.  Do I think I _should_ have to pay for it?  Hell, no!  I make barely enough to live; these companies make billions of dollars a year.  They can affore dthe cleaup far better than I can.  They made a mess, they should have to clean up after themselves.  My mother taught me that as a child; a pity it didn't sink in with these people.<br>

<br>
That's a fair question. And my answer is no, the victim should not have to pay for being the victim.<br>
<br>
However, that's not what this is about. The portion of the Superfund program at issue deals with what happens when the polluter and other responsible parties cannot be forced to pay the cleanup costs. Someone has to pay for it, or it doesn't get cleaned up.<br>
<br>
Let's use Toro as an example. They dumped all that green paint into the ground, threatening the ground water. They should have to pay to clean it up. Under CERCLA, they're going to have to.<br>
<br>
But what if Toro had gone bankrupt? Suppose that the EPA drags every last cent out of Toro's bankruptcy estate, its insurance carriers, and everyone else it can find, and the cost of the cleanup is still $25 million more than what the EPA collected. Who picks up the tab for the rest?<br>
<br>
Up to now, much of it has been funded by a TAX on industry. Bush is proposing that the tax be reduced. In other words, the question isn't whether Toro should have to pay for the cleanup, but instead is how much General Motors and Ford and hundreds of other companies should have to contribute to clean up someone else's pollution.<br>
<br>
If the tax on industry is reduced, the difference will be made up with regular tax dollars. Remember that those dollars include corporate income taxes paid by industry, as well as personal income taxes paid by the employees, officers, and shareholders of the companies in question.<br>
<br>
So this has nothing to do with a victim paying for being a victim. The question is how much industrial companies should have to pay in taxes to clean up pollution that they didn't cause. Before I formed an opinion on that issue, I'd want to hear both sides of the argument, not just a slanted article by some reporter for Time.<br>
<br>
If all of that is too complicated for you, I understand. It's a lot easier to ignore the hard issues and focus on simplistic rhetoric about &quot;victims having to pay for being a victim.&quot; <p>Sagemon Prayeth<BR>

Ok except I dont want to pay it. I want those other guys with the deep pockets to pay it. I am not a wealthy man(at least by my standards) Little things<br>
like a new computer, make a dent in the budget. A corporation is an abstract.<br>
Liability isnt easy to pin down. Enron is a case in point. They apparently had two years to loot the store and get out of town. No one expects to recover diddly<br>
out of it. If companies simply didnt pollute, there would be no problem.<br>
The Superfund initiative is more than 'just saving cash for a cleanup'<br>
It adds a direct cost to the act of polluting. Sure GM can claim they didnt<br>
pollute Dayton. But they DID make the cars that use the tires that Dayton makes.<br>
I used to live near Long Beach. It was a cesspool. Those mining rigs were everywhere. In a traffic jam if you were stuck on the highway it was a risk to<br>
your immediate health. I have no idea if the rigs are still there.<br>

Kudos to Sage for at least getting Chi to admit that he was totally misphrasing the issue and that it really came down to regular taxes or other companies paying for unfunded cleanups.  Chi you may as well have said, &quot;Yeah, ok, I was lying about it just like the rest of the liberals do, the real issues is that I wanna make sure I don't have to pay for anything....&quot;<br>
<br>
Zariel if you made $4,000 last year then you paid NO taxes at all....so you aren't paying for anything anyway.  But your whole argument boils down to your &quot;these companies make billions of dollars per year and they can afford it more than I can&quot; statement.  <br>

Corporations are just pools of people's money working to produce something and give people jobs.  A corporation is not a person, it is a tool.  And if you have the forsight to actually save any money in a retirement account then likely your money is in some corporation.<br>

A corporation is an entity. An entity that can hire lobbyist and usually is controlled by 10 or fewer people who may control other corporations. The average persons 7 shares in IBM doesn't make him truly an owner of IBM, no more than the fly whacking against my window is my pet. <br>
<br>
I have a crystal clear idea how corporations work, that is why I put money in the bank or in bonds because I refuse to fund my own raping. It's not class envy. I could give up my job go back to college for free and get a degree in anything and be hauling in 6 or 7 figures. I instead focus on my arts, something I feel cannot be taught or monetarily valued. <br>
<br>
Interesting you should try to point out the old conservative gripe about double taxation, well over 20% of my income goes to taxes, whereas a millionaire brokers is taxed fifty percent. Now the vast majority of the rest of my income is going into living expenses which is taxed again via local sales taxes. Whereas the minority of a millionaire's funds pay for living expenses, therefore a greater percentage of my money is going into the tax pool, so excuse me if I don't feel sorry because Ken Lay couldn't handle the remaining billions of dollars the government didn't tax. <br>
<br>
If Zariel made $4,000 last year, the vast majority probably was taxed, just not at the income tax level. I am betting he still paid gas tax, sales tax, maybe cigarette tax, as well as others. Speaking of the those, why do we have a cigarette tax or a gas tax? So the people who use the stuff the government deemed costly end up paying for it. Why do I pay more for car insurance than a woman my age with a different car? Because people who fit my description are what cost the insurance company the most in payouts. Corporations who produce toxins are what cost us the money in clean up so I see no problem in making them the party to pay. Do you think anyone is forcing people to invest in Monsanto, or even forcing Monsanto to produce substances nature cannot breakdown? They make a choice to do so, just as I make the choice to smoke. I am willing to pay the tax on that.<br>
<br>
Conservatives always try to make us believe it is taxes that bankrupt corporations, while the rest of us try to figure out how to keep a checkbook balanced with a paycheck half the size of our bills. Taxes have never, <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> NEVER</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->, bankrupted a corporation. The S&amp;L, Enron, all of them went under because of poor investments, and self serving management. Corporations don't exist to give jobs no more than a plantation existed to give black people a place to live. Its not like the heads hire us out of generousity. They hire us to make money, plain and simple. Why do you think corporations lay off after record profits? Because they know we cannot survive on unemployment and will look for another job than they can rehire at starting wage.  <br>
<br>
I have no problem paying for the government, I just think the rich should be forced to pay their fair share. They can afford the lawyers to hunt for the loopholes, I cannot. So it is our jobs as the ones stuck with the burden of taxes to watch those who dance upon the system they have used, abused and corrupted alll the way to the top. <br>
