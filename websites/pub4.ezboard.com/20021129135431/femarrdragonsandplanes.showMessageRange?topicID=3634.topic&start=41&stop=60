Gudanak is a level 42 rogue who was lucky enough to have Affliction hook him up with the Lodizal map piece on Friday when he asked for it. =)<br>
I camped Stormfeather this past weekend for 59 hours STRAIGHT(with family members logging me on when I had to go to work), during that time period the people that spent the most time around the SF camp keeping me company were Razer, Weegit and Gudanak. All three of these people respected my grueling camp as it went on and on and on...I was under the impression that it was a respected camp and NOT a FFA like Lodizal/RF because it was soloable.<br>
<br>
Anyway point is, Gudanak probably spent at least 20 hours there just BSing with me waiting for me to get the hell out of there. I was actually kinda glad when I heard he got the camp next...Then some ass steals SF out from under him. /sigh Some people will do anything for their own advancement. &gt;&lt; <p><center> <a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=102563"><img src=http://www.wwnet.net/~mriley/kogurwarlord.jpg border=0></a></center> </p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/utrechdashadowknight.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Trech Da ShadowKnight</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 763<br> <font color=#E9D756>(9/17/02 11:18:47 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3634.topic&index=45>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> .</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> So, since I paid the same for my parking permit as my fellow 30,000 students at the JC, and i dont have time to look for a parking spot, I can have their car towed just so i can park?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Sorry you havent grasped it yet. Crypte didnt have Razer &quot;towed&quot; away.

<br>
How many times do I have to explain this? my first post outlined it all pretty well, you just didn't take the time to read it and understand it...<br>
<br>
3 people in line for stormfeather. Guntalak or whatever was #1, Razer was #2, Crypte, showing up last, became #3.<br>
<br>
#1 died. Most people might think that giving #1 the map piece is going a little far. Most people would, however, respect that someone else was second in line, and would let them kill the thing. What #2 does with the map piece is #2's business, and in this case I would have let #1 loot it.<br>
<br>
being nice and respecting the 2 of us would have resulted in 1 of 2 things. either I would have killed the mob and looted the piece for myself, or I would have killed the mob and let the first person loot it. Both of these options were unnaceptable to Crypte, because neither of them had a chance of me giving the map piece to Crypte, so therefore he threw respect out the window in the name of phat lewts.<br>
<br>
And I am sick and tired of all this bullshit about &quot;I pay the same as you, I deserve stuff just as much as you do&quot; because it is ONLY used when dealing with a FFA mob and only when someone complains about a persons actions and lack of respect.<br>
<br>
These people will not pull this @#%$ or anything remotely like it on any non-ffa mob, because if they did a GM would be called and they would get in trouble for it. but since the gm's call this a FFA mob, or call the old ragefire a FFA mob, the people feel inclined to do whatever they want to kill the mob because they know a GM won't do anything about it.  <br>
<br>
Now they are stuck with a different problem. Doing what they've done may result in people getting angry and calling them assholes and whatever. What do they do now? they turn around and say &quot;pity me, I work many hours a week and can't play as much as the people I disrespected. I still pay just as much as them, so I deserve the mob as much as they do, but because I am an unfortunate soul, I am allowed to do whatever is neccesary to get what I want, how DARE you question me.<br>
<br>
It's unfortunate that I am in a guild that cannot do the big boss mobs in SSRA Temple. I pay just as much as magister players do, so I deserve a Khalshazar just as much as the rogues in their guild do, so I should be able to go ninja loot one next time that mob is killed because I don't have the manpower(time) to go kill it, how DARE you get mad at me for it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ukordailkneebasher.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kordail Kneebasher</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://home1.gte.net/res02gxq/spiny.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 525<br> <font color=#E9D756>(9/17/02 11:38:25 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3634.topic&index=47>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> ...</span><hr size=1> Wah. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uvalleycrest.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Valleycrest</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 17<br> <font color=#E9D756>(9/17/02 12:02:15 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3634.topic&index=48>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Crypte = ASS. stormfeather rant, ignore if you want :P</span><hr size=1> I don't think it matters what kind of camp it is, whether it's FFA or what not, he has his set of values and they conflict with yours.  I agree with Razor however and I think of the horror the world would become if everyone had the &quot;if no rules were broken, why are you bitching&quot; attitude.  He chooses to act the way he did.  I see it as tasteless. I don't want any association with people who act this way.  So I will not have any association.  Arguing over someone's personal code of conduct is going to go nowhere because some have the &quot;if it's not illegal, it's not wrong attitude&quot; and will not be able to see far enough past that to understand that what they are doing is wrong.  Some people play this game for different reasons.  Razor plays for the fun of a job well done, not by getting the phat lewts but by being a member of a community.  Others will play to get the best items all the time no matter who they step on in the process.<br>
<br>
How about this analogy?  I'm sure someone will find one off the wall instance where it will not hold true but here it goes anyway.<br>
<br>
You're standing behind someone in line at the grocery store.  The person in front of you reaches into his wallet to pay for his items but in the process he loses $100 bill or 100 pounds or whatever denomination is considerable.  He looks around but cannot find it (not even sure that he did lose money).  You watch the whole thing unfold and decide to let him keep looking.  He doesn't find it and leaves.  You pick it up and keep up...No laws were broken.  You have a legitimate right to that money.  But you're warped mind still thinks that isn't wrong?  Fine, I'm glad I don't know you.<br>
<br>
Some people who think no injustice was done I think like to play the devil's advocate role.  They also like to use an excessive amount of exclammation points and question marks.  That doesn't make me give your post more attention, why do you need to do that?  Do you want to give people the impression that you are yelling at all times? <p>Yalladar Valleycrest<BR>

That, as you've stated, would be ninja looting. This is a rule carved in stone. It is a something that you agree to everytime you sign on to everquest. What your failing to relize is that I never agreed to any sort of line/waiting list. I did not KS Stormfeather, there for have broken nothing I have agreed to.<br>
<br>
Something else...Neither me or Razer as of yet has mentioned anything about playtime. So where is all this coming from?<br>

First off these analogies are getting really stupid.<br>
<br>
What your asking isnt really right, should be more along the lines of &quot;if the guy in front of you got shot and died would you help him with his groceries or pay the cashier for your own&quot;.<br>
<br>
Guess thats not really any better than the rest of them.<br>

<br>
would I have given the map piece to the afk person if I killed storm? uhh, research the quest before you speak. it's a no-drop piece that cannot be chained, so I would get to decide should I wait for the afk person to come back from being afk to loot before it rotted or let someone else loot it. since it is the last piece I need, I would loot it before I would let crypte loot it since I put the time into camping it. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=138154"><img src="http://www.tbaytel.net/scaryf/images/everquest/razer.gif"></a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ugulyennmeerkat.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gulyenn Meerkat</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 354<br> <font color=#E9D756>(9/17/02 1:12:28 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3634.topic&index=58>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> Like Jem said.

The only point I was trying to make is that just because something is not against the rules or law for that matter doesn't make it right.  You may have been obeying the rules, but it doesn't mean that it's not wrong.  You have your own set of ethics, I have mine.  They're definitely not the same.  Congrats on being in the wrong place at the wrong time.  I hope that your map piece was worth it. <p>Yalladar Valleycrest<BR>
