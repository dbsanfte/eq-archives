 Now THAT is a bullshit response. Be careful Laoke, you are starting to sound as pompous as Popplo. <br>

You are saying exactly this:<br>
<br>
It's OK to train if you are an @#%$ by nature.<br>
It's OK to train if you are &quot;smart enough&quot; to be in Midnight Fury.<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
<br>
Point out to me exactly where I said, or implied that please?<br>
<br>
I'm still waiting.<br>
<br>
What I am saying is that actions have consequences. You killed 2 out of 3 members of Popplos group. You @#%$ up and they died as a result of your incompetance. Then, you pack an attitude and say 'It's not my fault'. You deny responsibility. <br>
<br>
That is what infuriates me, on so many levels. You where the direct cause of something and yet you have the balls to stand there and say &quot;I did nothing wrong&quot;. If you did nothing wrong, then I would be the first to say Popplo was outta line.<br>
<br>
For the love of the Goddess, take responsibility for your actions damnit!<br>
<br>
Quote:<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
 You have just insulted a whole group of people(my guild) for no reason whatsoever than to defend your arrogant ass of a friend.<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
<br>
Actually, I did it for a very specific reason. That statement I made could be taken many ways: either he's too smart to be in Storm of Dragons... or not smart enough. The implication could be, I agree, that as a guild Storm of Dragons is barely smart enough to realise that fire is hot. However, I don't really think this is the case. <br>
<br>
However, your friend Umbraes statement &quot; To any MF member I ask, are all of your officers this stupid?&quot; could be taken the same way. Boot hurts on the other foot, doesn't it? Umbrae insulted Midnights Fury, so I gave a little payback. Look back on my posts: I gave you ample room to avoid hanging yourself. You could have shut the @#%$ up. You could have admitted partial responsibility. You could, for the love of god, apologised for killing his group. You chose to do none of these things.<br>
<br>
So be it. If you chose to act in a childish and thoughtless manner I have no problems with holding a mirror up to you.<br>
<br>
Quote:<br>

<br>
<br>
Nope. You're letting your pride cloud yours. A pride, I might add, that seems to be digging you deeper every post you make.<br>
<br>
Popplo's not blameless here.  I'd be the first to admit that.  My main point is that you could have avoided this so very, very simply... but you decided that you weren't going to take any crap from Mr 60th Level Uber-Guild Member.<br>
<br>
  Those consequences of your actions can be a real bitch, can't they?<br>

<br>
  No.  I've never had a bad pull that killed someone not in my group that I failed to apologise for and attempt my best to make right however I could. <br>
<br>
  Oh, and my snowboard instructor, national champion ballroom dancer, incredibly bad poet, qualified massuese, self-taught computer geek, gainfully employed arse can't sing or play an instrument to save myself... my voice broke at puberty and I lost my singing voice and my spot in the local choir.  I'm failing to see why you brought real life into this discussion, other to claim that somehow you're better than I am.<br>
<br>
  You probably are.  The difference is that in a computer game, I treat players as people and take responsibility for my mistakes.<br>
<br>
  I'm probably not explaining my viewpoint clearly.  Let me give you a real world example.<br>
<br>
  A year ago, an old flatmate of mine was murdered, brutally.  Her body was dumped in the bush, 3 hours walk from the road, and her dog was thrown off a cliff so that people wouldn't get suspicious.  Her boyfriend who did the deed kept us in the dark for a month before we worked out what had happened.  When he came to trial, he claimed that he'd blacked out under drugs that they'd both been taking, and that when he came to she was dead.  The defense argued that as he was acting under diminished responsibility, he should only face manslaughter charges.  They succeded, and he'll be out on the street in under 3 years.<br>
<br>
  He took no responsibility for his actions.  He didn't see that he chose to take the drugs, his actions lead directly to the death of someone who you would have probably liked... she played classical guitar and had the voice of an angel.  He didn't see that he was responsible for her death. <br>
<br>
  That, I find UTTERLY abhorrent.<br>
<br>
  That is why I'm so strong on taking responsibility for your actions.  I don't mean to compare a trival incident in a video game to someone bring murdered:  I'm just trying to explain why I take this sort of thing so seriously.<br>
<br>
  You, and your friend, brought the guilds into it.  You killed Popplos group, and didn't even apologise for it.  And you're surprised when someone gets pissed and takes revenge?<br>
<br>
  It's not what I would have done.  But it's certainly nothing that I'm going to criticise Popplo for: as far as I'm concerned, your actions gave him every right to treat you as he was treated.<br>
<br>
  Oh, incidentally, if you check your logs I think you'll find he warned you before each train.  I'll happily admit that it probably was about 5 nanoseconds before the train... but at least the formalities were followed.<br>

<br>
I didn't die, my wife didn't die, my guildie didn't die.  I kept right on exping about 3 hours after the incident at the entrance.  I got a yellow and a half last night in 6 hours.  I feel bad about Umbrae but I certainly don't take responsibility for that either.  All in all it was a fun night.  Better than watching TV.  <br>
<br>
"No. I've never had a bad pull that killed someone not in my group that I failed to apologise for and attempt my best to make right however I could. "<br>
<br>
You honestly believe that under different circumstances(i.e. he technically trained us first...he pulled adds onto us, difference being we didn't die) I would not have apologized?  I'm not a bad guy believe it or not.  <br>
<br>
"I'm failing to see why you brought real life into this discussion, other to claim that somehow you're better than I am.<br>
<br>
You probably are. "<br>
<br>
Nope.  You are wrong.  I brought RL into it because you seem to be taking this way too seriously, and I hoped to introduce some perspective...that neither of us is better than the other.  Your absolutely arrogant statements about the superior "inteligence" of Midnight Fury demanded it.<br>
<br>
"The difference is that in a computer game, I treat players as people and take responsibility for my mistakes."<br>
<br>
I don't doubt this.  Popplo doesn't though.  His mistake was failing to ackowledge a "faggot group" and just waltzing through their camp.  His group members could have said "excuse me" as well, but they didn't.  Therefore once again, I see no reason to take responsibility for the actions of the terminally stupid.  <br>
<br>
"Let me give you a real world example"<br>
<br>
<snipped><br>
<br>
Overboard Laoke.  This is a very sad story but does not relate to this situation in the slightest.  The person he killed was innocent.  Popplo isn't.  If you fail to see that the whole thing was his fault then you are deluded beyond recovery.  I hate when people take potshots at uberguilds...but the attitude you have displayed here is doing nothing to dispel the myth that uberguilds believe they own the servers and can do as they like.  I take more offense to your statement about Storm of Dragons than I have taken from any of Popplo's actions last night.  <br>
<br>
"You, and your friend, brought the guilds into it. You killed Popplos group, and didn't even apologise for it. And you're surprised when someone gets pissed and takes revenge?"<br>
<br>
For the record, Umbrae is not in Storm of Dragons therefore she wasn't speaking for any guild.  I do not speak for my guild either.  I'm sure most of Midnight Fury are nice people but it's the loud, stupid f uckwits who train people in cold blood that stick in my memory.  <br>
<br>
This has all been said before.  I really don't like where this all has gone.  Can't we keep it confined to me being a shi tty monk and Popplo being a stupid, arrogant ass?<br>
<br>
Gloriana,<br>
I am not the first poster.  I did not want this posted to the boards to begin with and had nothing to do with her murder of the language. (j/k umbrae) She is someone who came to xp with us(she's a damn good necro ya know?).  A very nice person, but she doesn't speak for me.<br>

<br>
  Now.  Where, exactly in here can you draw a line and say I stated that Midnight Fury is more intelligent that Storm of Dragons?  I <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> delibrately</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> avoided that.  I'll grant you, the implication is there if you want to take it that way... but hey, after Umbraes crack &amp; your statement of &quot;I wasn't responsible&quot; I wasn't really in a mood to be particulary nice.<br>
<br>
  I'm admit that had I realised that Umbrae was not a member of Storm of Dragons I'd likely not have made the comment. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> I don't doubt this. Popplo doesn't though. His mistake was failing to ackowledge a &quot;faggot group&quot; and just waltzing through their camp. His group members could have said &quot;excuse me&quot; as well, but they didn't. Therefore once again, I see no reason to take responsibility for the actions of the terminally stupid.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
  You killed 2/3rds of his group and you claim you are not responsible?  Thats an interesting attitude.  One I don't agree with.<br>
<br>
  I'll grant you Pops could have been politer about it.  Mental note:  after I convince the rocks to bleed, make sure Pops understands basic rules of ettiquette.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Overboard Laoke. This is a very sad story but does not relate to this situation in the slightest. The person he killed was innocent.

<br>
  You're the one who brought RL into this.<br>
<br>
  Let me get this straight.  Popplo walks past a group in Chardok, heading deeper.  You get a couple of additional mobs from him that don't wipe you out... OK, that's his bad. He doesn't apologise.  That's his bad.  You then attempt to pull something past him, die, and wipe out 2/3rds of his group.  Thats your bad.  You don't apologise.  That's your bad.  You don't offer to res him.  That's your bad.  You give him attitude when he asks what the hells going on.  At this point, what the HELL did you expect?  A nice pat on the back for standing up to the nasty, evil uber-guild member?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> I hate when people take potshots at uberguilds...but the attitude you have displayed here is doing nothing to dispel the myth that uberguilds believe they own the servers and can do as they like.

<br>
  The attitude that people should take responsibility for their actions?<br>
<br>
  Well, in that case sign me up for Uber-guild uber alles 2002!  I don't believe that uber guilds own the server.  Time and time again I've driven the point home that both parties where at fault.  My whole thrust of the argument is this would never have happened had you not killed his group and not apologised.  I didn't think it was a particulary hard concept to grasp!<br>
<br>
 As far as the comment about Storm of Dragons goes:  you're not any more, or any less intelligent than Midnight Fury.  Make you happier?<br>
<br>
  I realise this is a foreign concept to you:  but had you apologised at the time rather than laying the blame on Popplo... this would never have happened.  I doubt you'll apologise now, and I -know- that Pops will never apologise to you.<br>
<br>
  Can't say as I really blame him for that.<br>

<br>
If Umbraes(?) group parked themselves right on the first bridge - would you not move past them, or pull stuff through them?<br>
<br>
camping in the only pullpath is generally a very bad idea ...<br>
<br>
pulling right past another group who is breaking an area without having proper agro on the mobs you're pulling is a bad idea....<br>
<br>
having a puller who dies on a very simple pull is a bad idea ...<br>
<br>
@#%$ with popplo is a bad idea ... <br>
<br>
using 5-10 hours of your time by making a fool out of yourself/entertaining the server with your whining rant instead of only loosing the 30 mins of xp you would have lost if you went back to xp'ing right away is hilarious ...<br>
<br>
Your group killed one of his group by acting like total noobs, he gets pissed and basicly tells you to not pull through him again or he'll train you. Then you get all pissy, telling him to shut up about training or you'll train him. /boggle<br>
Varanuss gets into an argument with Pops, and i'm pretty sure varanuss wasn't trying to apologize for killing Xanagg ....<br>
<br>
He then killed one of your group (by training) cause he was pissed(at your group). He goes back to killing stuff - you run to the nearest msg board hoping for support because you died and lost 30 mins of xp or so. <br>
<br>
someone is taking this game a little too seriously ...<br>
<br>
And no, i probably wouldn't have trained people cause they acted like asses. <br>
<br>
All in all an entertaining read, but kinda pathetic at the same time that the only fun rant to read only involves 1 death by very sloppy pulling, some insults/threats and one death by train. <br>

You gonna train someone back that doesn't give a @#%$ to begin with?  Maybe if you did it Vendrix's way and made them spend hours of their time getting their gear back, but otherwise, what are you gonna do?  I guarantee you that in real life social settings Popplo is a different person.  You don't just walk up to someone you don't know and just take something away from them without a reaction.<br>

That's what this thread is about.  It's about assholes who want to play a social game, but not take responsibility for their actions.  It's about a total lack of respect for another human being.  It's a pity more people don't see that, or even care. <p>Carathos Ollathir<br>

What the hell is that supposed to mean?<br>

First off, we all have opinions, who are you to say that ours are less valid then yours? Yes you can disagree with them, yes you can ignore them, but why in the world would you frequent this message board when you don't care about what any of us think?<br>
<br>
Secondly, on the 'if it was anyone else and not an uber guild member' part, F that, I do not condone training, never have, never will, it is messed up to do that to someone and it does not matter who does it. The only exception to this is people like Ewle, while two wrongs did not make it right, I sure as hell loved it that time.<br>

Call me a hypocrite if you like, sure, but at least I am not an @#%$, and I still have my morals. Something I don't think Popplo can say. <br>

I don't have any envy for MF, or any other guild thats more 'uber' than my own. I will choose to air my views if i see fit however. This is Rants and flames on a messageboard, it's kinda the done thing.<br>
<br>
My views on players are based on their actions and attitudes, not their guild affiliation. As such popplo certainly rates rather low, right alongside the idiot who tried to Killsteal the orc camp in EC when I was but a little warrior. Popplo apparently doesn't give a damn what people think of him, luckily I'm not too bothered that he doesn't beg forgiveness of me either &lt;shrug&gt;<br>

For the record I've never considered training or otherwise attempting to ruin a persons evening of entertainment. I guess maybe I'm in that minority that tries to consider the person behind the avatar and their feelings, plus i would personally feel bad about myself if I stooped to people like popplo's level. <br>
<br>
Yuck, sounds rather touchy feely, oh well.<br>
<br>
Oh and can you and Laoke please stop with the bullshit about 'not trying to judge people by your personal moral code' or whatever, saying that people replying to these threads are wrong to make any judgement is a judgement in itself.<br>
<br>
Anyway, you've quit Eq haven't you? Bad enough getting yourself so worked up about an issue when it actually has some affect on your life, now that it doesn't... &lt;shrug&gt;<br>
<br>
One of these days I'll post something in which I don't shrug I suppose.<br>
<br>
&lt;shrug&gt;<br>
<br>
Oh well,<br>

Truly laughable Celdor, I stopped reading after that seeing that. Seems you didn't have any more comebacks for any of the points I raised so now you go into &quot;none of what you say matters&quot; mode.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Question. Could someone explain why we say/type @#$%,fvck, and other such things instead of the actual expletive? Think maybe we could just get a drop down box so we can pick our own? <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Bikthar the reason for seeing a lot of peoples curses appear as $#%#$% is because since the Community Supporter subscription we are now forced to have a profanity filter which scrambles curse words. <br>
<br>
This is why most people type fvck to get around it.<br>
