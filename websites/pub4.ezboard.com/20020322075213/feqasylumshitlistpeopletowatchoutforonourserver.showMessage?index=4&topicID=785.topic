I realize that once they accept the title of GM they get an automatic Neg 75 INT and Neg 75 Wis ( yes i'm joking, but you all know what I mean ), but they have comformation ( not just heresay ) of the trade being made with nothing back in return.  <br>
<br>
Seriously though, isn't there anything they can do to help?<br>
<br>
I know if there has been items going both ways they probably couldn't because then there would be the argument that maybe he just decided later that he didn't like the price or something, but when it's obviously a mistake and the person won't return it, the GM's really can't do anything?  Why?<br>
<br>
Before you start flaming me, yes I realize he messed up by hitting trade, yes I realize that he shouldn't really be doing trades with &quot;switich to a mule&quot; type deals anyway, but be serious, have none of you EVER just handed something to someone and hit trade?  /eye  <br>
<br>
Didn't think so, I do it with food and lowbie equipment ( that i'm giving away ) all the time.  He made a mistake, we all agree on that, but this Ubbarlewtz ( which just SOUNDS like a thief to begin with ) probably saw the two of them standing there, had seen them both auctioning, and assumed that a trade was about to take place so he got in between them.  With this guy ( I forget the name of the person who has his item stolen ), lagging, he probably just didn't see our thief, and made his mistake.  <br>
<br>
Reguardless, it's still wrong to keep something that isn't yours.  People had me things all the time, sometimes I don't even notice it came from someone I don't know right away.  BUT, when Lagingtrader_01 sends me a tell asking if he gave me something, and I check and see that he did, I give it back lol.  Ubbarlewtz is being listed here because he would not give it back and lied about having it.  If I ever do that to someone ( which I never would ), I hope they list me here too.  Yes it's their fault for hitting trade, but it's not their fault that the person who got it has no honor.  <br>
<br>
I can't remember his name at the moment ( but i'd know it if i saw it ), but there was that one guy ( nine realms thing I think, /cheer again NR <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ) who admited to taking the stuff and his defense was, well he hit trade so it's his fault.  I just seem to be seeing alot of &quot;well that sucks but you hit trade so it's kind of your fault&quot; posts about this kind of stuff lately.  Yes, he made a mistake, but it's NOT his fault that this ubbarlewtz has no honor.<br>

If they did they would have very little time to help people who were suffering from bugs in the game mechanics.<br>
<br>
It would be very time consuming for the GM to have to get both sides of the story from the individuals in the ordeal, then read through back logs to find out what really happened, just so that they reclaim the items then give them to the new person.  I'd bet lots of petitions would soon become people just realizing they made a bad deal after agreeing to the trade and demanded a refund.  Maybe on Legends they'll up this kind of service, but doubtful. <p><TABLE BORDER="0" CELLSPACING="0" CELLPADDING="4" width="600" align="CENTER">

<br>
How many cases like this does it take for certain people to realize that you shouldn't trust people to have the same set of moral standards as you do by default?<br>
<br>
I'm sorry, I do not mean to flame the author of this thread and I hope you are able to see this, but now it is time to narrow your big blue eyes and see things from a slightly more realistic perspective. <br>
<br>
By all means, I condemn the actions of this &quot;Ubbarlewtz&quot; (really, who would take a guy with a name like that seriously? I know I wouldn't in a thousand years anyway..) and I know that had it been me that had receieved the item I would have returned it, not because I am a knight in shining armour (an ogre in dull blue armour, actually) but because I cannot stand having a guilty conscience.. Not everyone is bothered by this phenomenon, though, as can be clearly seen in EC nearly every day. Yes, I too have been &quot;scammed&quot;. By Law, anyone remember him? Hehe, thought so. I was very bitter in the aftermath but in the end it was nothing but a lesson. Trust your guildies, trust your close friends. That's what you have them for. But choose your guildies and close friends carefully.<br>
