Was it not AD trying to take Phinny a few weeks ago when your first attempt failed?  We wanted to move in, we had the forces and we backed out so you could try again?  Granted, there were not many people their, so your forces where not very big.<br>
<br>
All said and done, I know the GL's did not want this to happen, and I do know that most of us feel bad with the situation that started in SF and has become today.  I can not speak for them all, but I can say it wasnt done on purpose.  I have respect for everyone in this game, well most of the people i meet, but in order to gain respect you have to earn it.  Once again, please accept my apoligy as a grey even though I wasn't there and am not sure of all the details.  The only reason I apoligize is because I know that the greys would never purposly take someones camp ( even if ragefire is NOT a camp ) And yes, we have backed out OF MANY RAIDS, due to another guild being there.<br>
<br>
So can we get off our high horses?  It wasnt done on purpose, no matter what you guys think.  And i do want to tell AD one thing, Im a cleric in GL's and I have decided that my epic isnt worth this much turmoil.  So there, one less person to compete with.  Now I know why the greylords have no epics in their guild. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   BS like this just kills one's spirit.<br>

<br>
Your attitude in the beginning got tempers rising a little, but not much. Then an unguilded cleric came and threatened to manaburn rage when he popped, which got everyone in AD angry. GM came, GM say, GM said &quot;ffa, figure it out&quot; at which point PC and GL decided that they could come in and do whatever they wanted and nothing could be done about it.<br>
<br>
Let me recap...<br>
<br>
4 hours before GM came, 3 pc people, 2 hours before GM came, 5 pc people, GM arrived, still 5 pc people, GM left after telling us not to bother her about it again, boom, 20+ PC people came.<br>
<br>
4 hours before GM came, less than a handful of GL people, 2 hours before, still less than a handful, gm comes, wow, still less than a handful. GM says &quot;don't bother me again or noone gets ragefire today&quot; and we get swamped by 25+ GL peeps.<br>
<br>
Yes, the single unguilded cleric got us angry enough to petition, but it was the actions of PC and GL when they heard the GM's verdict that pushed us and got us really mad.<br>
<br>
And also, can anyone back up what they are saying about our cleric swearing at people in tells? I just wonder, because I never saw him say anything bad to people in OOC, and in fact when I made a joke in OOC to reply to someone else, I said &quot;Welcome to EverQueue: You're in our line now&quot; that same Cleric told me in guild chat to NOT do that, and others were telling the few other people I saw who were arguing in ooc to stop doing it to. so I just don't see why these same people would turn and start telling people off in tells when they didn't even want to see any of us talking to the other guilds in OOC. <p>If I was an Everquest character, I'd be:<br>

The real problem with this mob is just that there isnt one rule book there is 3 or 4 or 5 rule books. We as a server have tried to make 1 book out of all of those others, because as a server we agreed that sitting in SF for 5+ days to claim a spawn is junk and no one should need to go through that. Well, we couldnt agree on one set of rules so instead we have to fall back on VI's rules. I read every post in 20+ pages of debate and discussion about RF when we had the town hall meetings. If someone wants to try again to make 1 set of rules I will read and post my opinion again and sincerely hope that some amicable agreement can be reached. I really hate the stress of RF camps. Until then there is one "universal" book of rules and that is VI's. <br>
<br>
 Also Alderac - I understand how frustrating it can be to hope for something for a very long time and then not get it. The PC cleric who was also camping RF has camped it for 4+ days straight and not gotten it, has camped it several weekends where it was due but never popped. For single days and needed to go out to a bussiness dinner and it popped and someone else got it, taken off work to camp it, has passed on it because she wanted to be nice... So if you are laying claim on the camp because of all your hard work, please dont be blind to the hard work of other's. I am not trying to start a "who's woe is bigger" contest with this, because honestly, under the rules of VI, it doesnt make a difference. I just wanted to point that out to you. <p><center> <IMG SRC="http://web.tampabay.rr.com/staticpulse/Velondra.jpg"> <br>60th Ranger<br>Proud Dragon Bait of Phoenix Crusaders <br>Beloved of Neijek Domisilva </img> </center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ubanadassoulfinder.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Banadas Soulfinder</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 21<br> <font color=#E9D756>(7/29/02 12:26:36 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3495.topic&index=185>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Goldi</span><hr size=1> A few days ago a RL friend told me about this incedent with RF.  I decided to get on the boards and check it out, since it was making such a big stink.  After reading everyones posts, I decided to say something because i can see that may different people's feelings have been hurt via this incedent.<br>
<br>
A couple weeks ago i had an incident with a player that caused me to decide to retire.  When i first started playing this game I played for the ENJOYMENT it gave me.  It was my first online game with other people playing in VR around me.  I LOVED IT.  Then i got serious with it.  6-8hrs a day, camping this, camping that.  Getting very pissed when i was KSed, wanting to bite peoples ear lobes off, eat there children, ect...  Well back to the incident that night.  I was KSed again, the guy trained me with the adds he picked up from the KS mob, and i died.  I was mad as hell.  Stormed around the house, wanting to kick the three legged dog and such, when i though to myself, what the hell am i getting mad at a GAME for.  I started this game for ENJOYMENT.  With all the BS that goes on in RL, do i want to come home after work and have another cause for stress?  I decied no and retired myself.<br>
<br>
Why am I saying this?  Because i think that everyone reading this should take time to evaluate the GAME.  I realize that to some EQ is more than a game, but to have it come down to this kind of ludicrious name calling and such is very childish.  I have Friends in all 3 guilds mentioned above, that is why i am rambling like this.  Next time you are all in game, running by each other, and your tempers flare at each other, try and remember that the person you are looking at started this game for enjoyment, just like you did.  This kind of stuff takes the enjoyment out of the GAME for everyone.<br>
<br>
While this post prob doesnt make much sense, i just wanted to get across that this is just a game, the more people try to play for enjoyment, the better the experiance will be.<br>

Sure, PC was there before for a couple hours while we were, sure they said &quot;it's a FFA camp, first with a force to engage and NOT kite it gets it&quot; which angered people. sure someone may have responded in a bad way to that comment.<br>
&lt;Razer quote&gt;<br>
<br>
Guess what, it IS a FFA mob. I am sorry if you don't like hearing it but it is not an excuse to harrass people. An unknown percentage of people wanting it to be a camp does NOT make it a camp. Until there is a guild concensious, it will remain FFA. (btw, I personally am for making it a guild rotation if done right)<br>
<br>
If you have the force already there to engage the mob, Phoenix Crusaders will NOT gank or attempt to KS. We will sit back and let you have your chance. Your flames are pointless. A GM ended up rolling it because AD basically pissed off everyone in the zone.<br>
<br>
For the love of God, get that thru your heads.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
For Muulkeia,<br>
Guess what, leaving a guild right after you get an item like that is going to piss people off. (I even pushed for you to get that VS staff) (fyi, Can we kill Muulkeia? thats like a duel or something, not RL, so don't be so melodramatic) I got over it and I don't even think about it. What is your excuse?<br>
<br>
Btw, there were some people that were mad at DG from a long time ago and some of it was carried over by a few members. Certainly wasn't everyone or even a majority. And in many peoples eyes in PC is that DG has come a long way with any previous conflicts that nothing negative is said about them anymore by anyone that I have seen. I personally get along with many of their members. (Your blankets statements obviously show you are trying to personally flame PC) With the way you are acting, I am glad you are no longer in it.<br>

<br>
NO cleric deserves the epic over another cleric. Arguing camp vs timing it is merely a matter of preference and personal opinion. Both arguments have valid reasoning behind them but it is still a FFA mob in either case. If you are not the first there with the force to engage him, its not your mob.<br>
<br>
Arguing that a cleric in a smaller guild is more deserving than another cleric because they are in a larger guild that has many cleric epic is lame. The personal benifit to that cleric is just the same. The benifit to the guild may be different but that does not diminish its personal value to that cleric and does not give one the right to it over another.<br>

<br>
I have nothing to comment on about the incident this thread discussed.  I just finished reading almost all (skipping those w/o paragraphs <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ) of the posts here, and haven't yet read the other RF threads.  I will comment on this thread's content though.  It doesn't make for good press for ANY of the guilds involved. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :\ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":\"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Sefa and a small band of us tried to find a happy medium that would solve this problem months ago.  I helped moderate a few (2?) of the Town Hall meetings.  <br>
<br>
It ALMOST looked like we had a consensus  (not a perfect plan, but one nearly everyone could agree to - a practical compromise), and then things fell completely apart.  Mainly because of a few specific large guilds refusing to honor the plan that a lot of effort and consideration were put into developing.  The small &amp; medium guilds were (understandably) united in seeking a plan to solve this problem.  Several of the larger guilds (including some &quot;ubers&quot;) agreed to abide by any consensus reached, which was courteous and reassuring.<br>
<br>
The plan still failed. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  This episode is just another byproduct of our server not having a community solution.  /sigh<br>
<br>
Maybe the expectation (ugly that it may be) should be to /petition every day for a GM sanctioned random of interested parties for a RF spawn.  No one would ever have to camp for more than 24 hours, and it would alleviate the bickering.  The second place random winner would be allowed to have a raid force on stand-by in case the first force wipes (to ensure no spawn goes to waste).<br>
<br>
Just a thought.  I'm sure many (including myself) find Verant involvement in these issues distasteful.  Maybe we can do better.  Is E. Marr ready for another attempt at creating a plan for civility on this spawn?<br>

I should check some fact before I accuse the AD guild leader.<br>

I quote myself<br>
<br>
 /quote I know for a fact, that there are many good players in AD. Some of them have posted here as well, BUT I must say, that if a member of GL had used the same language and been calling names like the AD guild leader, we would have deguilded him on sight.<br>
<br>
 Since Dalamarn was sending a mail to the GL leader I wrongly assumed he was guild leader of the AD guild. I just found out that this is not the case.<br>

<br>
People respect one of them.<br>
<br>
If people are not going to respect that someone was there first, suck it up and find something else to do, then why on earth should anyone respect when they are camping something?<br>
<br>
You want a fun exercise in futility. Try this.<br>
<br>
You don't respect camp &quot;A&quot;<br>
<br>
That means I don't respect your Camp &quot;B&quot;<br>
<br>
That means you in turn don't respect my camp &quot;C&quot;<br>
<br>
And so on... Ad Nasuem.<br>
<br>
People will get pissed at all the bullshit that is going on, realise that the game is supposed to be fun, then realise that dicking over REAL LIFE PEOPLE is wrong. I don't care if you are a single cleric there who has 6 mana burn wizards, or 80 people. <br>
<br>
If they are there first suck it up and Wish them luck like you mean it and move on. <br>
<br>
Else we go back to exercise A and more good people leave the game and the dickheads rule.<br>
<br>
If it is a guilds stance to not recognise the effort and call FFA on ragefire then to be fair Don't recognize thier effort on ANY camp. Find out where they are Take you XP group and @#%$ up thier life.  Then be ready for them to come @#%$ up yours.<br>
<br>
Fair is fair isn't it? <br>
<br>
I didn't play on a blue server to have things like this happen. <br>
<br>
Be a decent human being, relise that others are playing on the playground as well And Stop Shitting on the Swingset.<br>
<br>
Don't be a dick to your fellow gamers. Stop @#%$ people over because you feel more important than them. Put yourself in thier shoes a minute. Hell HELP them get ragefire, Make a damn friend instead of an enemy.<br>
<br>
Running over another to get something you want in game is a piss poor thing to do. I wish for just one week I had a true uberguild full of pissed off zelots whose only purpose in life was to show people just how getting run over makes people feel. I would hate myself afterwords, but maybe some of the holier than thou mutherfuckers would get a clue.<br>

SHORT versoin.. tired of typing it.<br>
<br>
I've stated multiple time my view is my own.  I also cussed NO ONE in game.  I brought it to R&amp;F, which is what this is here for.<br>
<br>
Instead of replying to posts outside of R&amp;F which were done to keep the guildleaders OUT of R&amp;F, I get no reply, but instead an influx of members posting here.  Some were very well spoken and much cooler with the situation than I could be.  Others just tried a pathetic attempt at spindoctoring, trying to make AD look bad to take the attention off of them for their guilds' actions that day.  This is both fairly obvious and sure to fail because people see how WE treat people in game.<br>
<br>
I know a few awesome people in both guilds, they still have my respect and know they can call on me.  They would have wished us luck and kept walking that day (more likely would have offered to help).  THe others for the most part have lost what respect I (and others here apparently) held for them and no amount of trying to badmouth AD is going to remedy that.<br>
<br>
I'll end by saying that something needs to be done about this spawn.  As it stands, there is nothing to stop Ubergiuld_01 with 20 clerics from coming and taking the next 20 RF spawns at the last second becasue they have more firepower than anyone else.  There needs to be a rotation placed on this (dont give me that &quot;it's a kunark dragon like the rest&quot; garbage.. this is a static spawn, not a random wandering pop).<br>
  <br>
To any clerics that are unguilded or in small guilds, feel free to send me a tell and I'll add my firepower, as I'm sure many others will as well.<br>

Especially you, Odark, Luminaire, Alderac, Froog.<br>
<br>
From the moment I came to the RF camp your guild constantly had members coming and running up to sit in front of me or just stand in my way. I don't care. Alderac asked me why I was there. And I said I was camping RF to see if he spawns. He's FFA, this I know. If he spawned, yes I would have called friends there. From which came how I'm such an @#%$ that I won't respect your camp, etc, etc. Then I had quit the bit of spam inspecting going on from Luminaire, Froog and several other of your members. I warned you all to stop, and you continued. That is when I petitioned, and why I petitioned.<br>
<br>
I didn't care to get in an arguement, and was going to let the GM handle that matter. Which I did. But after the GM spoke to your guild leader to see what was going, Bloodwolfe, she decided to let us handle it. Fine by me, I was at the point to just leave until member's of your guild started with the whole behavior.<br>
<br>
From the moment you started this post you made a crusade against GL, and PC. Once it blew up in your face you began to push it on me, saying it was all my fault. The fact is, it isn't. And no matter how much you try to twist what I say, you've already proven it thus far.<br>
<br>
I'll leave you with this, I've been KS'ed on Ragefire. And until it's FFA I won't respect a camp for him. Yes I will sit there and metaphorically 'camp' it, but it does not mean I deserve any special 'one shot' deals. First with the force, is the first allowed to engage.<br>

I for one do not know any AT members, and really have not vested interests in defending or justifying any actions they could do.  The fact is, PC or GL clerics could be posting about how they were wronged by those who would not respect their work and I would be have just as much a problem with it.  Its not about AT, and its not about AT's innocence or guilt.  It is about how lack of respect for others particularly in the instance of this spawn negatively effects the rest of the server.  <br>
<br>
I have read some posts here stating how if PC and GL do not respect the RF spawn, they should not in turn be respected on their own camps.  Unfortunately, while part of me likes the eye-for-an-eye approach, that sort of philosophy is what causes this situation.  I don't give care one bit if AT did not react positively to your presence, and I don't frankly care if they called in a GM to solve the situation.  You were wrong to be there, and the justification of the claim does not rest at all on the actions of AT.<br>
<br>
And Sabiien and the rest of those arguing that they just don't feel like respecting the camp and others hard work because they were KSed... to be real brutal, grow up.  Being KSed must have sucked, and you of all people know how much it sucked... so you go and do it to others? What sort of reasoned, rational response is that?  The entire claim that he is FFA because you got KSed is like stating that any other camp in the game is FFA because someone stole your orc pawn in CB once.  It sucks that you were KSed... now exercise just the tiniest bit of empathy, and consider what you are doing to others when you do the same.<br>
<br>
PC, GL, or someone like Sabiien who decide that because their time online has not been roses and tulips they are justified in inflicting the same upset and hurt on others are what causes the problems with RF.  Respect it as a camp, give even one iota of actual compassion for folks going through what you went through, and stop with the claims of FFA. <p>Malevant Faeshadow.

<br>
I can not recall any one saying that PC feels that Ragefire is FFA because we were KSed.  We consider him FFA because the &quot;town hall meetings&quot; of a few months ago dissolved and he became a FFA to the Server.  There are links to it up above among all these other posts.  I am sure that you can read them and see where just about every single major Raiding guild at the time backed out of the Lottery/Rotation system as soon as the first guild said that they would not respect it.  That is where FFA became the server standard.  <br>
Not from PC, not from GL, not from Aff, not from KX, not from CE, not from DG, not from MF, not from Mag, but from all of them saying no I do not want to wait 3 months before my &quot;turn&quot; comes up and I get a shot at him.  If I catch him up and I have force I will take him.<br>
<br>
Do you really want a rotation on Ragefire?  Think about how long it takes to get a shot at VS now a days with 20 something guilds in it on a 3 day spawn it takes about 2 to 2 1/2 months to get a shot.  Well most of those 20 guilds could give Ragefire a run for his money so imagine upping that spawn time to 6-7 days per turn.  That limits it to 1-2 spawns a week.  5-6 a month.  Three months per round.  The rotations currently in place were setup when only 2-3 guilds could kill the mobs.  That is not the case with Ragefire.<br>

I can tell you this much, if the server as a whole can agree on a system, PC will respect that system.  But 15 people on a rants and flames section does not make a server consensus.
