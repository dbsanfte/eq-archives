<br>
I had not heard anything about Mitch when I joined the guild. Xastlin was one of the founders, I knew Jaeden from Lost Legion, and Mitch I had met I belive 3 times before in almost 2 years of playing &lt;At that time&gt;<br>
<br>
First time I met Mitch  I was about level 40ish. I traded Mitch a FBSS for a swirlspine belt. And Gave Mitch a Earring of essance to try and trade for me since she got the better end of the deal. I was supposed to go something like I give you a FBSS and the earring. you give me the Swirlspine and trade the earring for something a thief can use worth a bit more than the earring to make up for the FBSS/SSBelt trade.<br>
<br>
The next time I met Mitch she was in DB I belive. Xastlin was also in DB and Jaeden was as well. After DB Broke up &lt;?? or whatever happened&gt; Xas Came back to Lost Legion, and Jaeden came with him. Mitch I lost track of Other than to ask every now and again if she had gotten anything for the Earring. and to say hello when I passed her on the street.<br>
<br>
Then I joined Rage of Angels &lt;Was denied, so became Avatars of Rage&gt; I would have been in the origanal 10 I belive if I wasnt out of town that sunday I think it was.<br>
<br>
Mitch had had the earring for some 7 months by then. And While I had not forgotton about it It was not a priority, I don't know what she did with the earring during those seven months. &lt;I belive she wore it when she needed the MR but I am not privy to that info&gt;<br>
<br>
After I was booted from AoR I asked for the earring back. I got ignored and sorry I am busys a few times &lt;Lots of East commons time there. I checked. Anon doesnt hide you when in the same zone&gt; But I again shrugged it off but it was still bothering me.<br>
<br>
Then I saw her at the Fir Vie bank. Asked her for the Earring Since she was never going to come to me, and I was never going to see anything for 9 months of use of it. Mitch ignored me for a bit and after I sent her a long tell she gave me the earring. She was honorable in that.<br>
<br>
Shame I trusted her in the first place though. Mitch is out for one person only. Herself. At level 60 My net worth on all my charecters is probably 1/1000th of Mitch's,yet Jaeden says I am a loot whore. What a load of crap.<br>
<br>
Mitch earned all of her shit though. Through clean fair trades, and shoddy, take advantage of you trades. And Trades for dragon loot, and the best items in the game. And now she is 5 k Richer for a bracer that she didnt own. And who knows what crap floated around from the AoR loot. &lt;2 GEB's Just vanished, sold for guild funds I belive. Yet I gave 2 of our clerics 1000 plat each, of my own coin, in peradots to make sure they didnt run out on raids. I guess even when she steals it from people it is earing it to her. I mean stealing is effort too right?<br>
<br>
The whole time I just wanted to play with my friends, and go do things. I was sometimes a pain, sometimes bossy, and othertimes the model of a good little soilder. But I did mouth off and got slapped down for it. So be it. She had the power and it was her right to boot me. But she will not have any other say over me now. So hell with her and her slimy two toned reputation.<br>
<br>
My opinion of Mitch is my own. I am not forming it on he said she said and rumors. I am forming it on 12 months of sporadic contact with her &lt;Mainly reading the boards&gt;and a 6 week period of talking with her almost every day in guildchat.<br>
<br>
My opinion is wholly based on that. It is as follows. I don't care if you are a guy or a gal. I don't care what country you are from. On the boards you are a whiny, self serving, attention whore, who stirs shit up like it is an art form then basks in the glory of it. In game you were a passable monk with a fair grasp of tactics &lt;Not at all inventive though&gt; Fairly poor communication skills &lt;due to the billions of tells&gt; and the desire to only grace us if it was something that would benifit you. &lt;2 exceptions I think to that over a 5 week period&gt; If I met you on the street in real life I would get away from you as quickly as I could, and check myself for airborne illnesses and verify that my wallet wasnt missing.<br>
<br>
That awnser the question Chuk?<br>

Feather... Mitch was known by a few from Circle of Twilight (very small and old guild which (s)he was actually a founder of) as someone that was always a bit shakey.  Mitch claimed to be about helping the guild but was seeing auctioning items that would benefit other players (as did a few others as well, but the names escape me).  I personally trusted and defended Mitch until I noticed that the game was more important in the end.  <br>

Read the bit where I think Mitch should return the bracer.<br>
<br>
What I said, was that i find it entirely understandable that something like this would put mitch's back up, and after (according to Areo) a grand total of TWO attempts to get the bracer back, both times Mitch was busy, I find it alittle premature to come here and start spouting shit for which we have no proof.<br>
<br>
How about I come onto this board, and post some totally legitamate flame, against... Chukzombi for example. And i finish it off with something totally UNPROVEABLE which sounds terrible?<br>
<br>
&quot;Hey I was in Traks Teeth the other day, and just when I found uber_mob_01 Chuk came along and KS'ed it off me. (pretend that happened, and get ready for the best bit) I would have thought Chuk would want to be nicer to me after he ninja-looted that Magi Earth Staff from Hate to chain for his twink mage!&quot;<br>
<br>
The first bit might have happened, the second bit might be a total load of crap. But lets see Chuk prove his innocence to everyone here. Its impossible, and i have given you no truth, but you know what, people would probably believe me... its just got to be worded right.<br>
<br>
Alot of people dont like Mitch here, and alot of them are willing to believe whatever nasty things people will say. Using this kind of baseless accusations inorder to ruin someones rep and get your own way is bullshit.<br>
<br>
Mitch should give the bracer back, Areosa should stop being such an twerp.<br>
<br>
If a friend asked, I would lend them money. If I ask for it back and they dont have it on them, i dont think punching them in the kidney when they turn around is going to speed the process up. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/unirecnadthetrademaster.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Nirecnad the Trademaster</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 992<br> <font color=#E9D756>(6/16/01 11:45:15 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Mitch</span><hr size=1> I don't have a problem with either of the parties involved.

  Ok this is really sad that there are 10 pages about this one incident that happens on EQ every two min.  I think it would be helpful to remember a few things:<br>
<br>
 1. Like in RL there are stupid people, greedy people, nice people, fun people, mean people, etc....though in EQ there seem to be a larege number of people who are stupid, greedy, and mean just cause they can be like that online.<br>
<br>
<br>
 2.  This is just a GAME!!!! You lost a magical bracer worth 5k pieces of platinum that in RL means jack. It isn't like he stole your car or made you lose your house.<br>
<br>
<br>
 3.  How many times have you read the message from the gm's telling you not to trade items with other players without having an item in the trade window?? I hate to say it but if you want to get pissed about someone not giving you stuff back in EQ then only give stuff to people you know and trust in RL who play eq with you. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ulordnaos.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lord Naos</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 374<br> <font color=#E9D756>(6/19/01 1:41:52 am)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.io.com/~charon/sig.jpg heigth=100 width=100></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Mitch</span><hr size=1> I like Mitch<br>

Did hell suddenly freeze over?<br>
<br>
'Is all well in EC tunnel land?'<br>
<br>
Things were not well ever since the first banded went on sale, downhill from there<br>
<br>
'Did everyone finally realize Red Dwarf is THE British comedy?'<br>

Hell freezing over !<br>
<br>
First, we postulate that if souls exist, then they must have some mass. If they do, then a mole of souls can also have a mass. So, at what rate are souls moving into hell and at what rate are souls leaving? I think that we can safely assume that once a soul gets to hell, it will not leave. Therefore, no souls are leaving. As for souls entering hell, let's look at the different religions that exist in the world today. Some of these religions state that if you are not a member of their religion, you will go to hell. Since there are more than one of these religions and people do not belong to more than one religion, we can project that all people and all souls go to hell. With birth and death rates as they are, we can expect the number of souls in hell to increase exponentially.<br>
<br>
Now, we look at the rate of change in volume in hell. Boyle's Law states that in order for the temperature and pressure in hell to stay the same, the ratio of the mass of souls and volume needs to stay constant. #1 So, if hell is expanding at a slower rate than the rate at which souls enter hell, then the temperature and pressure in hell will increase until all hell breaks loose. #2 Of course, if hell is expanding at a rate faster than the increase of souls in hell, then the temperature and pressure will drop until hell freezes over. So which is it? If we accept the postulate given to me by Sweething during Spellcasting 101, "that it will be a cold night in hell before I go out with you" and take into account the fact that I still have not succeeded in going out with her, then #2 cannot be true, and hell is exothermic<br>

<br>
you assume, indirectly, that having no mass = unable to move<br>
<br>
This is incorrect in that light has no mass and yet travels<br>
<br>
therefore i refute your hypothesis!<br>
<br>
so all the planets and asteroids and stars and dust = 20% of the matter that SHOULD be out there....who the fuck stole the other 80%????<br>
