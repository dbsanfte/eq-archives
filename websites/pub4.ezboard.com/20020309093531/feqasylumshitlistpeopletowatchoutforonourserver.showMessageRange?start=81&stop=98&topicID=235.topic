I consider myself pretty good at it, even though its a difficult place to pull there is only one route for 5 groups to pull in. Cross pulls can easily happen in there, and you can get into trouble fast. <br>
<br>
That being said:<br>
<br>
My position is if I screw up pulling I reach down, reattach my nutz and take it like a man. If you get mobs on you its your fault, not someone's else's. People sitting in a zone, or medding at a camp did not make a mistake and aggro a bunch of mobs...you did, therefore you deal with it or die.<br>
<br>
The only person responsible for getting you in a situation where you would have to run to the zone is yourself. The solution is easy, dont go aimlessly wondering around dangerous places. If your pulling and you mess up, deal with it. Your group can always drag you out and get you a rez. <br>
<br>
I spent many hours learning how to pull for this simple fact that running mobs to a zone full of people was not an option for me. It actually made me a better puller. Granted people make mistakes, but judgeing from what Istrahd said you know very well the consequences of your actions.<br>
<br>
Just remember if you get mobs on you, its your fault no one should pay for your mistake but yourself. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/udeolyenvie.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Deolyen Vie</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>h0x0r!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(1/14/01 9:59:08 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=235.topic&index=86>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: RADIC</span><hr size=1> &quot;The solution is easy, dont go aimlessly wondering around dangerous places&quot;  That is EXACTLY how he caused alot of trains.

<br>
This is to answer the brother excuse that I have seen people use time and time again. You are responsible for your account. That means you are responsible for how other people use your account. <br>
<br>
So you want to be nice to your brother and let him play your character, that's great good for you. If he acts like a total ass which according to you Radic happens all the time, its your fault. You gave him access to your character. That would be like me giving my pin number to my ATM to someone and not do anything after they steal from me over, and over again. <br>
<br>
If your brother is unwilling to stop playing your character, change your password. You are responsible for the integrity of your account.<br>

<br>
Kianea has the just of it: She is giving Radic a second chance, but is keeping him on a short leash.<br>
<br>
How many of us have done something and regretted it? How many of us have ever regretted their actions too late? How many of us were not believed when we said something we knew to be true? How many of us were never given a chance to prove it?<br>
<br>
What Kianea is doing is giving Radic a chance to prove himself, you already know that she will take any complaint against him seriously, as she has already stated. If Radic wants to play he will play, regardless of whether or not he is in a guild, in fact I daresay that him being in a guild reduces the likeliness of him doing something bad, after all it gives him a reason not to. A guild that is kind to him will make him happier, and will also encourage him to be better.<br>
<br>
As for all of these posts that are flaming him... we get the idea, these posts are useful to a point, but after saying the same thing over and over again it degrades to meaningless bashing. The points covered are this: He has stolen something (ignoring any opinion held on situation specifics), he has trained people, and his word is doubtful, and then some personality flames. If you have anything other than these things to add then it gives us more to judge him by, other than that, the point is well taken.<br>
<br>
Give him a chance, let him prove himself, and simply report it if he does something bad.<br>

     It was this guild that gave him a second chance that he used Play Nice Policy against.  He also begged for money directly from guildees and even from me, but I said nothing.  I've pesonally witnessed him getting in way over his head in Lake of Ill Omen and causing trains, but I said nothing.  I saw him try to use Play Nice to take a camp a guy had been at for a week anfd then get mad at the guy for not sharing the camp (GBS camp.  He can't use GBS, but nor could the guy that was camping it), I said nothing.  All of this while he was getting a second chance.  He has had more than just two chances with me.  From experience dealing with him I can tell you, it is NEVER his fault.  Always someone else's fault.  I'm not kidding when I say he is the most selfish EQ player I have ever seen.  It's always me me me with him until it's something bad then it's always someone else.<br>

Don't come on here and tell me you were VERY upset when you know good and well you thanked me for saving you the trouble. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ulivak.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Livak</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>h0x0r!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(1/19/01 9:47:04 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=235.topic&index=95>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> BACKPEDDLE?</span><hr size=1> Alright Deoylen...That line has officially pissed me off.  <br>
<br>
Your tells to me?<br>
<br>
I WANT HIM REMOVED NOW!<br>
<br>
ARE YOU GOING TO REMOVE HIM?<br>
<br>
Are you going to Remove him or what!<br>
<br>
<br>
meanwhile I&quot;m trying to talk to different people about what happened, INCLUDING Aendiin, and I did reply at one point I would remove him, but i ALSO added, but i need to find out from him and the others before i did, or do you have selective hearing?<br>
<br>
and as for thanks? perhaps you are confused. I was glad you brought it to my attention, and yes personally?  It WOULD save me alot trouble to not have him guilded, but i ALSO told you it wouldn't have been fair.  How MANY times have i said it wouldn't have been fair.  Being a guild leader isn't about what is easier...<br>
<br>
as for your temper and ego? <br>
<br>
I&quot;m only wondering why in the hell I didn't see it earlier.<br>
<br>
You can kindly Guildremove yourself at your earliest convience, if you are going to think yourself above ANYONE in the guild...I had thought well of you until you seemed to have outbursts with anything having to do with Aendiin.<br>
<br>
I would rather not have come to this, but every time i see you post on this list, it's as if you are trying to boost yourself as you bash him...and there is nothing you can say that can make me think it is right.<br>
<br>
And you are most likely right that there are several things i do not know about him...But ONLY what happens now, and in the future will have any effect on my actions.  To do otherwise is wrong.<br>
<br>
Perhaps i'm  just a weak willed little bitch, but I can't justify what happened...nor how you heart what you wanted to hear, then reacted on it.<br>
<br>
I stand my my post and my decision. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/udeolyenvie.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Deolyen Vie</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>h0x0r!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(1/19/01 11:32:45 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=235.topic&index=96>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: BACKPEDDLE?</span><hr size=1> I don't think myself above anyone PERIOD.  Me and Radic have a long history, you have none with him.  Of course I judge him more harshly than others.  I've seen alot of the stuff he has done with his own eyes.  I did nothing about it at the time.  I waited until I talked to you.  I logged on specifically to talk to you and you said that you were going to remove him.  He then walked right passed me as I was in NRo tunnel.  I've never done anything but right by you and your guild.  I am not abusing a friendship and would NEVER do that.  You tell me you are going to remove him, he walks by me as we are talking, I ask if you want him removed, you say yes, so I removed him.  Then you tell me thanks for saving you the trouble.  This post is the FIRST time you have said one word to me about it since then, because now you realize it wasn't the popular decision.  If it were such a big issue with you then you would've said something then.  Radic has earned my disrespect.  Do you think I'm the only one who posted on this 95 response shit list thread?  Do you really believe it was always his &quot;brother&quot; that did all those things?  I don't.  I am a stern person by nature, but I've given him more than just a couple chances.  He had more than just a couple chances long before he ever recreated another char (because he had screwed up so bad with his last one nooone of his level wanted anything to do with him.  I didn't do that either, he did, er &quot;his brother&quot; did).  Am I more harsch on him than someone else?  YES!  Is there a good reason for that? YES!  I respect those that have earned is and I disrespect those that've earned it.  And don't take the high road on me because you won't have anything to do with RoA (an entire guild) based on bad experiences with them.  So what makes that different?  I made no guild decisions without expressly asking you.  No invites and sure as hell no disbands.  I always talked to you first and this is no different.  Doesn't really matter now because I've left the server, but please don't accuse me of being a selfish person.  Ask anyone that knows me and they can tell you it just isn't so.  All these people can't be wrong.  Do people deserve a second chance?  Yes, but not a 3rd and 4th and 5th.  And my final words, I would not abuse a friendship EVER and I'm sorry one was broken over this. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ucoramoor.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Coramoor</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>The Valiant</span><br> <font color=#000033>(1/20/01 2:59:31 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=235.topic&index=97>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://geocities.com/killerkebab/cor.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: BACKPEDDLE?</span><hr size=1> I think all of you are in loved with him /giggle <p><center><img src="http://www.geocities.com/killerkebab/samurai.jpg"></center>

<br>
Why?  well he WAS the other person there...and I'm sorry but I wasn't just going to remove him.<br>
<br>
as for highwater?  BS, and you know it.<br>
<br>
As for unpopular he was removed?  with a few of the members yes...With some who have been there a long time, No...and when you removed him, right after i was telling  him he would not be removed Just yet, but he should give me a reason why i shouldn't seeing he's on probation.  What do i have to do? suddenly announce he's been removed and act like i had a clue it would happen Right then and there :P  Fun, let me tell you.<br>
why did i announce it?  Many tells regarding it that You put me on the spot for.<br>
<br>
Damn politics deo...and damn you too.<br>
<br>
I'm not going to defend myself or my actions to you any longer.  I brought this to the shitlist because you posted something that was considered by everyone else to be an exageration...I will not come back here to post, so feel free by all means to bash away Deoylen, you have an open target, and I'm not going to bite back.<br>
