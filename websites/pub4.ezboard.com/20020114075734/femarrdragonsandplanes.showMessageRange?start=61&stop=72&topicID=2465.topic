<br>
As for asking my group, once again I DID and no one knew ANYTHING about Molt or Zel switching char. Heck like I have stated a friend of mine was in on this raid from the time it left Nagafen's Lair and he, too knew nothing about you switching.<br>
I also asked a few of the other naked raiders running to Permafrost if they knew what was going on, THEY too did not.<br>
<br>
<br>
There is a post stating that how could I help from FV, but I stated (SEVERAL times now, must be selective reading) I made the run from NK to Permafrost so YES I was there for the last half of the CR helping out as much as I could. Was I suppose to sit in FV and hope to get a rez, since no one I talked to knew what was going on or run up there and do what I could to help everyone else? (Well I chose to run back to permafrost to help out, sorry if this was the wrong thing to do. I think I roleplay just a bit much.) Oh and if I wasn't in the zone how could I shout that I wanted my corpse or attempt to rez myself (which is how I found out the rez timer ran out)? I assure you I came back, thinking it was a ffa CR the whole way. When I got into Permafrost is when I found everyone else there and figure my services would be needed down in the Kings room.<br>
<br>
Oh and as for zel's problems, it does happen, happens to me quite a bit and it is a pain. =(<br>
<br>
Believe me I knew Arch was a leader too, I did look for him, but had NO idea that I should try who all gorn, nor did anyone else I talked to, like I said the people I talked to (in my group AND others) had NO idea what was going on...COMMUNICATION. I am not asking for someone to hold my hand and lead me around, I am saying that the people I knew to look for were not online. No it was not stated in chat, just loot, strategy and groups, mostly loot.  <br>
<br>
IF I was to EVER lead a raid that went wrong (I may someday, but not for quite some time!) and had to switch chars for money transfers I would ATLEAST let my group leaders know and expect them to COMMUNICATE with thier group (ESPECIALLY if I am making an exchange with thier alt, or they dropped zoning) I did lead a guild &quot;raid&quot;, not really a raidable place but I needed something from there (LGuk, I needed the Cav), set a time and asked them to join me, which they did so YES I know the pressure involved in leading a raid, setting up groups (thre were 3 on this one), planing on where to go (I did have help since, to this day, I don't know Guk that well!), and what to do!<br>
<br>
I will also admit I did make a mistake, not binding. (I have NEVER rebound myself on Naggy and did not know that Vox was SO much different, this was my first!) I did correct this on the second failed attempt I was on, and the third raid , the one that took her down, we casters were told, BIND HERE. Made me uncomfortable, alittle but I do not second guess any leader of a raid I have been on. (Especially Kerna who has a nice running record against this vile beast!)<br>
<br>
AND LASTLY, I was in on the raid that finally took her down as was Ironlute. So IF I am such a bad player, why did you stay seeing me (heck I was the crap buffer, which was an honor considering the leader of that raid has been here and posted as well.) I was actually afraid I would not be welcome all things considered. Thanks again Kerna for having me and having faith in me to do MY job, when so many people like to blame me for the lack of COMMUNICATION that got me here, and posting. It was a GREAT raid (and an honor to serve under you YET again, I was on Naggy with you as the leader, I also look forward to serving under you again!) and amazingly enough no one in my group died, I MUST have done MY job! (though I admit, I ALMOST did die, I wish I knew who saved my butt so I could give them credit for it, Thanks!)<br>

Tuasai Skywatcher<br>
45th Level Cleric of Erollisi Marr <br>
Dragon Slayer, I know it will happen one day (&lt;name of dragon&gt; has been slain by Tuasai)<br>
<br>
Oh an let me just say a few thing to Parum, like yes 42 IS too young for dragons but not many Clerics will do Naggy the leaders kind of take younger clerics cause they will go. It was an honor to serve under Golems on my first dragon raid EVER at 42 and no I don't know him personally! <br>
yes shit does happen and sometime you just have to vent, thank goodness for this message board. teehee<br>
You are right I should have asked about binding, but on Naggy I never had to rebind myself so being fairly new to raiding was not aware that Vox was so different!<br>
And no offense taken Parum, I know I am not one of the gimpy ass idiot to whom you refer (and I have never had the pleasure of serving with you, yet!=), though I am still kinda green when it comes to raiding, Tormentcia knew this and was VERY helpful in breaking me in!<br>
I don't think I would like Everquest if I was one of those people who had to be told WHAT to do, and WHEN! I do not think I would have survived in KC for 3 hours (at 43) without the great group I had there or with them having to tell me how to heal (though I did learn one thing there about 54th level warriors and thier amazing cripling blows disc when beserk, and BELIEVE me when they found out (I was not anon or roleplay) they were amazed that we lived, so I think that does say something about my healing abilities! =)<br>

I recall that Moltaenya and Gorndax, I believe, did say who they had switched to when they made the switch in Permafrost.  A lot of people heard it so if you had typed something like &quot;/shout Where is Archaeon or Moltaenya?&quot; you would have gotten an answer.  Also in the chat room I remember Moltaenya or Gorndax (as Archaeon) saying something like &quot;Moltaenya, Gorndax, and Khaliz will be giving out instructions...&quot; so hint hint there about who the raid leaders were.  Some other people from the raid switched characters to help out with Corpse Recovery, too (Demmorg switched to his necromancer, I think, for Mana Twitching)...  you can't blame them for trying, right?<br>

Thats not a bad record at all, I have never led a dragon raid and I commend you on the patience and knowledge you must have to pull them off succesfully. However bragging the way you appear to be makes you look less than classy, I mean really you killed a bunch of pixels, do you think you are going to be remembered for that in 5 or so years time, or get your story on the front of a newspaper?<br>
<br>
While your record is impressive, you must always remember there is always someone else who has done better. <p><img src="http://users.bigpond.com/raymies/rolesig.gif">

lemme get this straight, you are bitching over a 3 hour CR?? you said earlier you've never done planes, if a 3 hour CR twists your panties, you can't hack it in the planes. i've seen some hate and fear raids go really really bad and have a 6 hour CR easy. i have had to leave my corpse in hate and pick it up when another guild went up there and cleared first floor and TL me out. the way you break these plane raids, unless you can handle a jailbreak, is you run in and die on purpose, and hope 1 or 2 clerics make it alive. if you can't go to a raid and expect exp loss, you shouldn't be there<br>

<br>
A) Everyone puts their record at the end of their sig when they are actively raiding. It helps encourage new people to sign up.<br>
<br>
B) If vox is a paint by numbers raid, so is every other raid in this game, it's called <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> STRATEGY.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
C) I only attended 3 Vox raids before I started leading Vox, and 1 Nag raid before I led Nag. Never been on the net to get ideas, would not know where to look.<br>
<br>
D) If <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> anyone</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> can lead a Vox raid, answer me this. In the last 15 raids on Vox, 7 have failed, 8 have won. All 8 victories have been led by myself. The other leaders are experienced and have killed her before, and take more people than I do, they know exactly the same as me. Why did they fail?<br>
<br>
I win because I take the time needed for the battle. I spend time recruiting to make sure we have enough people to kill her, while not making the loot rolls absurd. I run my raids as a dicatorship, if you can't follow instructions, get the hell out.<br>
<br>
This was the first brag I have ever done on any post about my dragon slaying. It makes me feel good to be needed. If you don't like it, I can come visit and shave your eyeball with a deli slicer.<br>

You heard em!  A Deli slicer!<br>
<br>
*stands behind Kerna with her fists up*<br>
<br>
anyway... I'd just like to say that I've been fortunate to go along on most of Kerna's Vox raids and one of his Naggy raids... and I have yet to see someone with the leadership style that he has... he's very VERY excellent at leading and getting things done... in game if the name "KERNA" is mentioned people usually say "omg that guy is feking awesome" because he's GOOD!  I dont think he's standing there with his thumbs in his ears his fingers waving his fingers saying "nah nah nah nah nah I killed vox X number of times" I think he's just saying "hey I've done it, done it right, and I've done it more than once" and hey... there's nothing wrong with that.  With his style, skill, and leadership abilities (YES SKILL) I would go on any raid, any quest or any "event" that's lead by this guy... that says something... because Im not the only one... when there were pickups being made... a TON of people said "I wont come unless Kerna..."  and hey... that was cool.<br>
<br>
<br>
And as far as the sig at the bottom showing the "score" yeah... if someone was posting VOX 5 ME 2 I dont think I'd be too giddy about going on a raid that they are leading =P<br>
<br>
So anyway...<br>
<br>
does it really bother you that much ANYWAY?  I think this whole thread is "amuzing" yet ridiculous.  But hey... Im just one person and my opinion doesnt mean squat =)<br>
