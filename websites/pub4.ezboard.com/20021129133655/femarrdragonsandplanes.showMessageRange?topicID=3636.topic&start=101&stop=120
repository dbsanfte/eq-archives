Ive been guilded with you on and off through different guilds over the past 2 years.  I dont know a single time that I havent seen you stir @#%$ up over something.  Ive never said anything about it up until now. <br>
<br>
STFU ... if you dont like the way things are going in this &quot; GAME &quot;  do us all a favor and quit.  <br>
<br>
I was guilded in CE when AoR merged and you went with, that was about a year and a half ago.  I left CE due to my not playing enough and I didnt want to be a burdon on the guild, like you are.<br>
<br>
Now just stop your bitching and grow up.  Your complaining about people being young and immature, well your the one that isnt acting your age.  What are you 4?  geez man grow up and take your deguilding like a man.<br>
<br>
thats all, good luck <br>

<br>
why not make a new name? even if it would be pretty easy to find the new poster...beeing that in every post the person would bitch about something, try to get people to care, and say &quot;i dont need your support.&quot; when no one is giving it to you anyways. besides...if you did make a new name anyways---people only need to look for someone that is so into themselves beeing right and above everyone else...to find you.<br>

he accepted that risk. You see there is far more to the issue with CE than I am <br>
willing to say here. Til knew who I was and what I was like before I entered CE.<br>
He knew because he was guild leader of Dawn Brigade also. Of which I was a member. In that guild YES I WAS invited. <br>
<br>
No he did NOT take me aside before entering CE and tell me that his officers were<br>
sancrosect and could not be challenged. If he had I would not have joined.<br>
I assumed (WRONGLY) that the guild rules applied to ALL members, not just<br>
non-officers. <br>
<br>
After roughly four months I decided to try playing again. At that time and ONLY<br>
at that time Til mailed me asking me to stop posting on the Emarr board.<br>
And I did. However I did notice that Hoppkins continued to post. He still does.<br>
At that time Hoppkins was NOT an officer. So I mailed a formal complaint to the guild leaders asking WHY is the policy not enforced in Hoppkins case.<br>
Til has a habit of removing posts he doesnt like from the guild board. I asked him<br>
if I had lied in my post. He said that didnt matter. That is where he lost my respect. The truth is ALL that matters. Why cant the guild members see when the guild leadership is inconsistant? If it doesnt matter why not let them?<br>
The truth is that he didnt want to come down on Hoppkins. In that case, he should have told me that. He didnt. So I told them that it was not fair to ask ME to refrain from posting, WHICH I HAD FOR OVER TWO MONTHS, and not ask Hoppkins to also. I have e-mail to back this all up BTW <br>
<br>
In any case the responce was - 'say whatever you want, we are not babysitters'<br>
My responce was immediate, I posted within seconds of getting that e-mail.<br>
<br>
The entire issue escalated from there. Hoppkins continued (and I am sure will continue) to post.  Each time breaking the policy that he tried to force on me.<br>
<br>
I dont agree he is special, I think hes a punk. <br>
<br>
The reality is that CE has no policies. There is no protection from an officer that doesnt like you. If that had been stated to me clearly before I entered the guild<br>
I would have laughed at Til and walked away. <br>
<br>
If Til actually expected me to follow guild policy, he HAD to enforce that on<br>
all members. In which case I would have done as requested. <br>
<br>
************************************************************<br>
<br>
If some ass punk LT tries to force a man who doesnt wish to be there to dig<br>
a trench 3 feet wide and six feet deep, just because he tossed a butt on the ground. He is showing poor judgement. It is VERY important that an officer<br>
evaluate what is 'reasonable' in his decisions. If this happened to me<br>
I would demand a court martial and a board of inquiry. I would claim extenuating circumstance. I would be very likely given an article 15 and invited to depart.<br>
If you think that they send men to jail for throwing cigarette butss on the ground,<br>
all I can say is where does that happen?<br>

Everyone knows that training is a punishable offense. It is a Rule/Law of EQ and is stated as such in the PnP. Failure to read the PnP is not an excuse becouse ignorance of the Rules/Laws is NOT a defense. The person broke a Rule/Law of EQ and should be punished, correct? Why does this not apply to the scenerio you presented? The person broke the Rule/Law of the base and should be punished.<br>

Sigh, I guess if a person keeps talking long enough they are bound to paint them selves into a corner.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> One day he is out on break smoking a cigarette. He tosses the butt down.  Some snot nosed 2nd Lt tell him to dig a trench six feet deep and three feet wide to bury the butt in. The same 2nd Lt acts surprised that the guy demands a<br>

<br>
And if instead of a 2nd LT, it had been a Major, who happens to be a vet?  Or what do you think that nobody over the rank of 2nd LT as given out a punishment that is too harsh for the crime?  Do you think everyone over the age of 40 is a capable leader simply becuase they have been around for 40 years?  Hm, is this punishment even that bad?  Considering a carelessly discard item can give away information to the enemy(like how long ago someone was in the area, the fact that patrols go by there, even the nationalty of the person.)  Even if the guy thought the punishment was to harsh, that doesn't give him the right to disobey the order.  It's not an imoral or ilegal order, so you suck it up and do it.  Thats not to say that this 2nd LT isn't going to be talked to by his superior officer, doesn't matter if he gets busted down to private for making the order, if you defy it your ass is grass.  <br>
<br>
The fact is that 60 year old men can make stupid calls.  Their great age doesn't make them some how exempt.  If that was the case people would simply be premoted becase of their age.  One of the nice things about EQ(other then the fact thats its a GAME and not the army) is the fact that people usualy get premoted based upon their preformance, and prejudices often don't factor in.<br>
<br>
I've seen some kids that play this game, and run around being assholes, getting off on @#%$ with others.  Guess what, I've seen grown men do the exact same thing.  <br>

<br>
When hopp posts on any topic Its usually british humor or sarcasm or irony all to get a laugh (Hopps one of the funniest people I have ever met, and I Mean that in a good way) He doesn't start flames on players or guilds or contribute to the fires on other threads. Hoppy is a great guy and doesn't come to emarr board to start anything. Most posts anyone in CE makes on these boards are more of "non flame/rant" posts alot of us use the Auctions and sometimes we post in general or R and F. I don't feel that is a bad thing, just about noone causes trouble on those boards, I know hopp doesn't, and that is who is in question here. I've personally never logged into the R and F and said hmm who can I flame/rant on today or look for a topic already and just want to add fuel to the fire. After all its just a game where we are suppose to be having fun.<br>

Your loyalty is touching, but your logic is misplaced. Even if what you said WERE true, the policy says NO MEMBER.<br>

Setting that issue aside, it doesnt justify him harassing me in a raid.<br>
Nor does it justify the guild leadership refusal to make him stop.<br>
<br>
I do not admire his behavior, I dont think he is funny. The policy say NO MEMBER.<br>

No man is above the law. Yes its a game, and Til protects him now. But life has<br>
a way of throwing a few curves.  I think it might do you some good to ask Ice <br>
for a list of Hoppkins posts, hes good at that type of thing you see. It might just open your eyes a bit. No offence intended. <p>“It is clear that the individual who persecutes a man, his brother, because he is not of the same opinion, is a monster.”

I know...</span><hr size=1> I know you dont care, but I have been reading this thread and one thing jumps out at me..<br>
<br>
<br>
In this case,  IT REALLY IS only a game.   The only &quot;laws&quot;, &quot;rules&quot;, and &quot;guidelines&quot;  are those that Verant imposes, creates, hides behind. <br>
<br>
Any rule created by the players is meaningless and following those rules is purely voluntary since nothing really will happen ify ou don't.<br>
<br>
DOn't get me wrong, in this case okay you feel you were wronged,  but man the power you are giving these people.  Whether they did or did not do these things is meaningless.  If it really bothers you why the hell do you keep the guild tag?  What purpose does it serve?  <br>
<br>
I really am not trying to bash, if it comes that way I am truly sorry but. . I just don't get it.  I saw the same thing when I ran my guild for nearly 2 years.  I had many many friends there but the pedestal they put me on frightened me,  the power they gave me. . a virtual leader was absolutly frightening.<br>
<br>
Why are you doing the same?  So some guy has a guild, makes some rules and breaks them. . it is a GAME.   Just as you said you deserve to play the game the way you wish to play it so don't they.  If they made the rules, or are favored by someone so they get off,  that is their right. (NOT Saying it is right or wrong, integrity comes from standing behind your word and your self made rules)  but it is their right to do what they want in their guild.<br>
<br>
There are no rules for how guilds should be run, there are no rules for how a guild should treat their members.  Quite frankly anyone who ISN&quot;T happy in any guild but sticks around is either an idiot, or a leach trying to get @#%$ out of the guild as much as they can.   There is no other reason for it.  A virtual group of people, with meaningless except for in the virtual world rules, betters you as a person in NO WAY shape or form.<br>
<br>
You can't put on a resume &quot;Single handedly straightened out Guild X&quot;  You can't pick up a date (I know you are mrried you know what I mean), it does nothing for you.<br>
<br>
If you think they are pricks, let them be pricks it is their right.  They have no obligation to change how their guild works or treats people because you don't like it.  It just doesn't work that way.<br>
<br>
It isn't designed that way.<br>
<br>
As skiltair said.  Guilds are for the most part monarchies and in some cases benevolent or not so dictatorships.<br>
<br>
Cliques WILL form,  it is a trait of guilds that has to be accepted and worked with.<br>
<br>
It is just the way it is, and in a virtual world, with no &quot;tools&quot; for guild management, you aren't going to get much more. You can't. Human nature won't allow for it.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Sorry, wordy and all. . but while you are pissed, and in your mind rightfully so,  why waste the effort on something that really, honestly and truly, makes no bit of difference? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uchiteng.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Chiteng</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 1929<br> <font color=#E9D756>(9/18/02 11:17:37 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Lulen</span><hr size=1> Hmm have you been in the service? You make it sound like you have. I fear I come<br>
from an era before sexual integration of the armed services. I dont like officers.<br>
My favorite targets are 2nd Lts. They think they have all the answers and they dont listen to the non-coms. Ok that is the way it WAS, possibly NOT now.<br>
<br>
If it had been a vet Major, I hope to hell he would know better. How the hell did he get his braid? If he was a combat vet I am certain he damn well WOULD know better. People like that dont last long in combat, in the USarmy. Maybe Jarheads<br>
put up with it, but not grunts. Most officers I know let the NCO handle the discipline problems in any case. Which would mean a punch in the face for the<br>
infraction we are talking about. Ever seen a pissed master sergeant? I have.<br>
It was a unpleasant experience.<br>
<br>
Now I am talking about draftees here, people that didnt ask to be there.<br>
They dont see article 15 as punishment or the army as a career. they just want to go home ALIVE.<br>
 <br>
I dont know anything at all about the career army. I dont want to.<br>
I can see that if you WANTED to be there, you might actually be stupid<br>
enough to dig such a fooking hole in the ground.<br>

They know the truth of what I say. Til may control the guild board but NOT this one. I question his decisions and his leadership. Not everyone is willing<br>

Yes its a game, but is a lie in a game less somehow than a lie in RL?<br>

 My boss pay's me because I'm good with clients, can do the job well, and can fix the server or any computer that has problems saving him 6g a year. That makes me a well paid executive whilst you are an asskisser. I'm glad we could draw that comparison.<br>
<br>
<FONT COLOR=#c2cafc>So where are all the people who scream at anon posts?<br>
But its ok when they flame Chiteng. Yeah thats what I thought.</FONT><br>
<br>
I disagree with Ice. It was a very cheap shot and more then that it was unfunny, if Nuldar is reading this I will second Chiteng's motion to have that post nuked and no, I'm not doing that to prove Chiteng wrong.<br>
<br>
<FONT COLOR=#c2cafc>I suspect that Mitch for all her faults, (which are many)<br>
Can play a monk better than you can, AND beat you on any MMORG where you both played. That matters to me Igota.<br>
<br>
You are too willing to see her bad side, and apparently unconcerned about her good<br>
side.<br>
<br>
You may have noticed that I respect very few people. But Mitch I do respect. </FONT><br>
<br>
I played with Igota once and he struck me as a very competent player. Mitch and I shared a bat cave in Sol B once when she was soloing. She seemed competent but because she chose a relatively easy place to gain her EXP then I couldn't give a full report on her skills. However this is a pretty pathetic excuse for having respect for someone. The fact of the matter is that Mitch is a lying pyscophant whilst Igota is honest, trustworthy and funny. All qualities your idol lacks.<br>
<br>
P.S. There is only one way to beat a "massively multiplayer online role-playing game" or MMORPG for short. It's not to compete in Vex Thal of the Plane of Ubergodliness. It's to have fun and socialize whilst facing a series of challenges. You failed at that.<br>
