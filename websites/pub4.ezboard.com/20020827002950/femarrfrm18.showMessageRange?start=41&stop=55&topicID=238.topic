<br>
<font color=Yellow>I think everyone has the right to lie to questions they feel pressed to answer but don't want to.</font color><br>
<br>
Interesting view point.  I find it slightly alarming that you choose qualify it.  A lie is a lie, so are you saying that a lie is good or bad?  Despite Kytherion’s wishy-washy-whatever-works-for-me opinion on this.  Its black and white.<br>
<br>
The problem with your view point is that if you say a lie is okay then how do we know when they are telling the truth.  Do you really want to elect a president and hope that the things you elected him for are actually the truth this time?<br>
<br>
<font color=Yellow>Did Clinton lie on the stand? Yup. Is it against the law to lie on the stand? Short answer yeah. Long answer no. There is precedence (and that is big in legalities) where charges of perjury have been dropped because the person didn't know (s)he was lying,(oh Bill knew I won't argue that), where the question was misunderstood,( I doubt he misunderstood), and even when the person could prove he wasn't receiving a fair trial.( hmm that one could have worked but man how much longer would the trial have drug out. thank you Bill for not choosing this route).</font color><br>
<br>
So you are comfortable with this precedent or no?  If so then lets get rid of witnesses all together.  You can’t allow one person to lie and one person not to.  <br>
<br>
I find it funny that people find it disgusting when people are trying to use the World Trade Center tragedy to make money and then say its okay that Clinton lied on the stand.  Are you really not aware of the fact that lying and cheating and stealing are all tied together?  Integrity is integrity, and lack of it is also … lack of it.  You are the ones that are encouraging the opportunists, and then you don’t understand how someone could do that… whatever.<br>

So if we must communicate that way Cendan Thinkinleast, i will oblige you.<br>
<br>
OK here goes your enlightenment for today. There are virtually no absolutes. A lie isn't always evil. A lie to protect the innocent is actually what i consider a good thing. I have no problem sleeping at night after telling children about Santa Claus, few do. If I came across a car wreck and found a decapitated woman and another wounded panicked person I find it would be in bad taste to be blatantly honest there. Those are gray areas. Its not morals, your right, its common sense. The presidency should not be a figurehead position. It is a job. Does it bother you when your employer lies? I don't elect a president to keep track on his personal life so if he lies about that I am not worried. I elected a president to do a job. If he is a lieing sack of shit i can still tell if he is doing his job. I look beyond the headlines. It isn't hard with millions of radio, television, print, and internet journalists it is quite easy to see what is going on. I do compare presidents. Comparison is how we make judgements. <br>
<br>
I am very comfortable with those precedence. You would be more comfortable knowing that people who answer wrongly to questions they did not know the answer too, or who weren't recieving fair trials could be punished for perjury? Lying politicians and greedy businessmen are a by-product of a caapitalist-democratic republic. One does not neccesarily beget the other. Capitalism, not people who assume dishonesty is a part of humanity ever since we developed communication skills, is the reason we have oppurtunists. <br>
<br>
An employer can ask you if you were accused of a crime. An employer though is staring down the barrel of a multimillion dollar lawsuit if they ask you about who blew you and went and confronted the suspected. <br>
<br>
Clinton was not a good choice, he was our only choice. Especially in his second election. I would rather have a man whose moral faults are sexual, than a man whose moral faults are racist. His opponent, Bob Dole, was the last Congressman to vote against the civil rights ammendment. I find a blow job a lot easier to deal with then segregation. Maybe if i were a repressed white male like niudar i might favor seperate drinking fountains, but alas I am just a man. <br>
<br>
So please cite for me an example in which our country actually suffered because THE PRESIDENT LIED ABOUT SEX,<br>
and please try not to rehash the thing about not trusting our leaders. The Russians could trust a drunken Boris Yeltsin. The colonists could trust a horny, slave molesting Jefferson, and bastard producing Ben Franklin. Perhaps an example stating another country was so apalled by our morals they cut off talks with us. Maybe an example where distrust in the honesty of the president caused businesses to leave the country. <br>
 So you see until you can get a grasp on what an issue is and what the job of the president is you are just going to keep buying into partisan propaganda bs. I suggest not only looking past the headlines but polishing up on history because where we are going can be determined by where we have been. Our best leaders have done things that are immoral in at least someone's eyes. So the original statement questioned was &quot;How are Democrats going to destroy the country?&quot; We know in retrospect with certainty that his lieing did not destroy the country no matter how much it blurred the line where the minority thought black ended and white began.<br>
<br>
PS to save you the trouble of having to think up new insults and a legitimate answer i have included here some distortions of my screen name for you to address me by that will surely send me crying to the bathroom and perhaps cause me to see that there really is a true evil and satan was pulling the strings on clinton.

<br>
<br>
No, we're talking morals. Let's go over a few common sense exceptions, that occur in the real world, where real people live. Just like the president!<br>
<br>
I'll put them in multiple choice format, for the sake of fun.<br>
<br>
<br>
1) Domestic Terrorism<br>
<br>
Let's say the FBI informs the president that they have located the source of the anthrax mailings, and that within a few days, they will be prepared to execute a raid in order to capture the people involved.<br>
<br>
Reporter: &quot;Mr. President, have we made any progress on the anthrax investigation?&quot;<br>
<br>
A) &quot;Why yes, Mr. CNN man. We've located the bastards and have them under surveillance even as we speak.&quot;<br>
B) &quot;No comment.&quot;<br>
C) &quot;What?&quot;<br>
D) &quot;No progress whatsoever. I apologize sincerely.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
2. Espionage<br>
<br>
&quot;Mr. President, do we have spies in Country X? A country whom we are not at war with?&quot;<br>
<br>
A) &quot;Why yes! We do! How did you know?!&quot;<br>
B) &quot;No comment.&quot;<br>
C) &quot;Shhh!&quot;<br>
D) &quot;Now why would we need to spy on our friends in Country X? Don't be silly. Nope, no spying activity.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
3. Warfare<br>
<br>
&quot;Mr. President, where will our troops strike next?&quot;<br>
<br>
A) &quot;Right here! (points to map, indicates true target)<br>
B) &quot;No comment.&quot;<br>
C) &quot;Your house, bitch.&quot;<br>
D) &quot;Right...here!&quot; (points to false target)<br>
<br>
4. Dating and Marriage<br>
<br>
&quot;Do these jeans make my ass look fat?&quot;<br>
<br>
A) &quot;I could land a squadron of WW2 bombers on your ass.&quot;<br>
B) &quot;No comment.&quot;<br>
C) &quot;Enormous. I can feel the tides shift when you get into bed.&quot;<br>
D) &quot;Nah hun. Looks superfine.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
Now, Cendan. Your ideal president answers either A to everything, with the occasional B. Which would either get him impeached or shot for treason.<br>
<br>
My ideal president answers D for everything, which makes him a big fat liar. But, it's important that we win wars, maintain stable foreign relations, catch bad guys, and not get kicked in the crotch by our girlfriends and wives. So it's important that our president be...<br>
<br>
...COMPETENT...<br>
<br>
rather than...<br>
<br>
A FATHER FIGURE FROM A 1950s SITCOM.<br>
<br>
<br>
Right. Merry Christmas.<br>
<br>
<br>
(Query: Integrity = always telling the truth or integrity = always doing the right thing? Shucks, why didn't the Beav ever address this issue? Must be nice to live in a black and white world.)<br>

<br>
When its all over all I am going to see is that you won't think it through because despite you seeing what I think as idealistic and based solely on morals... the alternative is to say its all okay.  It is not okay.  Telling the truth isn't easy all the time, and I don't think anyone does tell the truth 100% of the time... but that does not mean that I will ever be in a position to say "yeah, I can see why they lied, I would have to."<br>
<br>
Oh well, hope you have a happy holiday.  By the way, the answers would depend on who is asking but for the most part I would say that the answer to 1,2,3 are "B", and 4 would be a variation of A,B,C, and D.  First off I only dated skinny girls.  Second my wife of 4 1/2 years has gained some weight and I love her no less but don't lie to her.  She knows what makes her look big and what flatters her... because I tell her the truth.  Try it, its nice.  I have found that if you tell her something doesn't look great... it doesn't matter as long as you compliment her when she finds the right thing. <p><font color=green><b>Cendan Tankenpriest</b></font color><br>

Nope, a convicted felon or one convicted of a misdemeanor has released to the public at large the nature of their crime in virtue of the people ruling against them.<br>

I do not have to reveal to my employer any personal information at all if I wish. There is no law that requites as much. Indeed, there are laws protecting us (in the US) from discrimination should personal information be shared with a prospective employer.

Cendan, I think you are thinking of the 5th Amendment here which actually doesn't pertain to giving testimony before Congress. In fact, if one refuses to answer a question put to them by a congressional hearing they can be found in contempt and jailed. The 5th Amendement only protects one when questioned regarding a capital offense prior to a grand jury hearing. Short answer, Bill Clinton did not have a &quot;right to refuse to answer personal questions&quot;. He could have flat out told the truth, flat out lied, or took his lawyers advice to word his answer to provide him a large gray area should he had to return to a congressional hearing (provide enough truth to pad a lie). <p>Lurikeen Mali'Kyre<BR>

When it comes to telling lies we are all Pragmatists. The ends truly justify the means. If your wife asked you if she looked fat you would not say she looked like a fat pig even if she is a 300 pounder! Indeed, you would say something like &quot;No! The jeans you sowed together from yards and yards of Denim look good on you! Why would you think that I would think you are fat?&quot; Truly, the attention you recieve from your wife warrants such lies! It is the end we have in mind when it comes to any sociological relationship.<br>
<br>
Imagine, Hilary saying to Bill, &quot;Did the whore Monica blow you? Did she? How could you Bill! I am better looking than that sow!&quot; How is Bill Clinton going to respond? Like every single red blooded married man in the world &quot;Why no she didn't, we didn't have sex! She means nothing to me. Hell, she isn't attractive to me at all like you are baby.&quot; Are such lies morally justifiable? That is the REAL question. The question can't be as simplistic as whether or not it is wrong. Everybody will agree that lies are WRONG. Who really cares.<br>
<br>
Lies are morally justifiable given the situation we are in and if the effect of telling a lie results in a moral good greater than if one told the truth.<br>
<br>
I would gladly lie to protect the lives of my family. I will lie and tell more lies to protect my country. See the point? <p>Lurikeen Mali'Kyre<BR>

Some also felt that though they don't like lies personally, they think its ok for Clinton to lie in any situation, because he is the president and its part and parcel to the job.

Well, thanks for the well thought out answers.  (excepting one).<br>

What I really wanted to see and for others to perhaps notice is the trend.  I was hoping that most people would reply with something that said they think lying is wrong, though they do feel that Clinton was harrassed etc.<br>
<br>
If you look, though, it seems like the trend is that its ok to lie, not only is it ok, its acceptable and even desirable.  <br>
<br>
/boggle  <br>
<br>
I don't know about you folks, but I sure would not want my child taught that its ok to lie because the world accepts it.  Morality should not be subject to the popular trend.  <br>
<br>
In Clinton's specific case, which was of a personal nature, he did not have to lie.  Getting a BJ is not grounds for impeachment, neither is cheating on your wife.  As someone stated, there are many leaders who had &quot;bad&quot; habits, and led &quot;immoral&quot; lives but were effective in their leadership. <br>
<br>
However, all of us have a choice whether to lie or not.  And Clinton did as well.  He chose to lie, and he continued to lie, till the moment he was caught, then he BS'd his way.  <br>
<br>
He acted like the 3 year old who doesn't want to get caught.  He simply didn't want to face the fire.   <p><img src="http://personal.mia.bellsouth.net/mia/k/l/klin2923/Luk.gif">

Lukaria, I think you are failing to see that Clinton had no choice at all. He had to lie given the circumstances. I purposefully answered your poll with very pointed and down right insulting remarks, because I had no doubts you would ignore it. However, when such questions are put to you in a Congressional hearing you can't choose silence. You are forced by law to give an answer or you may be jailed for contempt. Clinton was specifically asked questions of a sexual nature by congress such as &quot;Did Ms. Lewinsky perform felatio on you?&quot; How do you answer that as the President? Hell, you can't even answer if you masturbate or not in an anonymous forum and you expect the President of the United States to publicly admit Monica sucked his cock? /boggle  You just don't seem to get it Lukaria.<br>

<br>
It is called &quot;Situational Ethics&quot; Lukaria and most fundamentalists, like you, can't get beyond &quot;black/white&quot; thinking and see that there are situations in which telling a lie is the right thing to do and is morally justifiable, hence GOOD. I teach my children that there is a time to be direct, silent and lie. Always, with out fail, lie to grandma if she asks &quot;Do I look fat and old?&quot; Tell her &quot;no&quot; and that she is beautiful (eventhough she looks like an ugly man!). Would you tell someone who is threating to kill you and your family where the children are located? Knowing that silence will only force them to search the house wouldn't you lie and say they are at grandma's house for the night?<br>
<br>
Finally, morality is subject to the &quot;popular trend&quot; because it is the majority that make up the &quot;rules&quot; to protect themselves from a minority and to protect their property (amongst other reasons as to why to create rules). There has never been such a thing as the &quot;Moral Minority&quot;. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Even though Jerry Falwell would like us all to think so. <p>Lurikeen Mali'Kyre<BR>

<br>
I have thought it through. I have lived it. There are lies I've told I don't question nor regret. There are truths i have told i wished I didn't. Your answers my dear Cendan to Kytherion's questions would cause people to die. Is that morality at work for you. You see in regards to the warfare question, Der Fuehrer was under the impression that a landing was going to come form the allies north of Normandy so he had troops concentrated there. Ever seen 'Saving Private Ryan' imagine twice the gunpower and troops there.  So to whoever leaked the false information to the nazi's then well thanks on behalf of one gratefull American. <br>
I got a game of hypotheticals to help you here. Murder is bad. It says so in the law of virtually every religon and government, but similarly they all allow for justifiables. <br>
Answer the questions below...<br>
1 would you shoot your own son?<br>
2. Would you shoot your own estranged son?<br>
sound pretty stupid but keep going<br>
3. Would you shoot your own estranged son who has joined a terrorist cell?<br>
4. Would you....terrorist cell and is taking over the plane you are on?<br>
Hmm getting tougher<br>
5. Shoot son if he is aiming the plane at the space needle?<br>
6. Your pregnant wife and young child are in there?<br>
<br>
At which point would it be morally justifiable to pull the trigger. I couldn't do it till 6. the thing goes on but i can't remember it all. At 5 he his going to kill himself me and countless others but i know i couldn't do it. Does that make the person who can fire at four beter than me or me better than them? I don't know. Who am I to judge others. You see there are so many minor ripples and invisible backstories to any situation that it is a horrible flaw to push our morals on others.<br>

Thank you for thinking your answers out a bit and being receptive, but this is where I strongly disagree. I come from a huge family and a small town so it was often that I was around small children and let me tell you the two types. The one whose parents were responsible and the one whose parents were never at fault. Morality came from frank honest discussions with parents and adults for me. Momma taught me right from wrong and the people on the airwaves were distant characters.  I watched WWF as a kid and never powerbombed a nephew through a table. I watched war movies and sci fi and horror and never attacked anyone with a knife. I listened to rock and never ate the head off a small animal. I grew up in the eighties with Rambo, MIA, GI Joe, Alice Cooper, KISS, and a host of other &quot;corrupting influences&quot;. Morality didn't come from the Oliver North trials on tv. It came from family and friends. If you childrens morality is determined by presidents or tv or anything besides you and your circle of intimates perhaps you should turn off there tv and talk to them. I don't mean to seem preachy and am sorry if I do, but morality is a sensitive issue and in my humblest a personal one. If the moralist had there way a lot of the means i used to vent would have been not available. I do agree morality should not be subject to popular trend it should be personal. <br>

Peace and happy new year.<br>

<br>
I don't exactly see where you disagreed with me? <br>
<br>
I teach my son right from wrong.  I impart what I feel are strong moral values to him.  I do this so that when he is older and begins to make those hard choices by himself without Mom and Dad there, that he knows exactly what he is choosing and why.  If he chooses to lie, I want him to realize that he is indeed choosing something that is wrong, and why he is choosing it.<br>
<br>
In my post, I wasn't talking about my son sitting around watching television.  I was talking about the pervading thought that its ok and even desirable to lie that is the norm for many people.  My son will have interaction while growing up with others, whom may think its fine to lie, and in turn, my son shall learn that.  While of course I want my son to grow to make his own decisions, and of course I have some measure of control over his life at the moment - the ultimate responsibility for raising my son is me (and his father).  I am not concerned with my husband or myself.  I am concerned with other parents who teach their children that its GOOD to lie in certain cases.  Eventually, my son will have to make his own decisions, I am simply praying that he makes the right ones and when he chooses wrongly - that he knows it.<br>

<br>
Of course I ignored your post, it was purposely rude, anyone could tell that.  I did not reply as I stated to you before that I will not reply to any posts of that nature.  I am not here to engage in a flame/curse war.<br>
<br>
Lets go over a few things here that I think you are failing to see Lurikeen.<br>
<br>
You state that Clinton had to lie.  <br>
<br>
This is NOT true Lurikeen.  Clinton did NOT have to lie.  He chose to lie.  It may be justifyable or not depending on your view, but he still lied.  <br>
<br>
When asked whether Monica gave him oral sex, Clinton had three choices before him:<br>
1) Lie<br>
2) Tell the truth<br>
3) Say nothing and possibly be found in contempt of court, possibly resulting in jailtime.<br>
<br>
I do not see where the only answer is to lie when he had three choices before him.  He could have told the truth, he simply did not want to.  <br>
<br>
Would I WANT to answer such questions on National Television personally? No.  I didn't like Clinton having to either, but if asked, yes I would answer and I would answer the truth.  <br>
<br>
Also, Lurikeen, having to answer or be jailed is STILL a choice.<br>
It may not be a great one, but he could have chosen that as well.  <br>
<br>
Moving on, I don't see how I am a fundamentalist or how I am a black/white person when it comes to moral issues.  Simply because I believe something differently than you does not make me inflexible.  However, if being a fundamentalist to you means standing up for what you believe and taking a stand against what is WRONG morally, then yep I am one and boy am I glad to be so.  <br>
<br>
Next,  your situational ethics point is good, but I think you have completely missed the point.  Perhaps you need to read a bit more carefully - without the blinders on.<br>
<br>
I never said that people do not choose to lie, whether to make Grandma feel good, or to save the life of your child in the house, or to save your butt if Monica gives you a BJ and your name is Bill - My basic point here is that it is wrong to lie.<br>
<br>
Let me state that again.<br>
<br>
It is WRONG to lie.<br>
<br>
I never said I would never lie.  I never said that in a given situation (the one where a killer is coming after you and wants to know if anyone else is in the house) that lying might not be the better choice.  I simply stated the moral ethic here - its wrong to lie.  You can choose to lie anyway, it might even be justified, it might even make someone feel better, but it is still wrong morally in my opinion.  Just like cheating on your wife, stealing, etc.<br>
<br>
If you really need clarification try this example: Whether you embezzle a million dollars, rob a bank, steal $5 from your Grandma's purse, or take a loaf of bread to feed your kid, you are still a thief in the eyes of the law.  It is a punishable offence.  Would any one of those be more justified than another - certainly.  But no matter how you squirm, its still stealing.<br>
<br>
If everyone lived according to justifications, then pretty soon, I am positive someone would come up with some reason why it was justified to kill their kid, or their dog, or their Grandma, or their Mom and Dad (oh wait a minute, we HAD some cases like that didn't we!).  <br>
<br>
We have laws for a reason.  <br>
<br>
Clinton committed perjury.  He did not have to, he chose to.<br>
<br>
Wether or not it was justified is subjective, some people think yes, others no.  I don't think it was.  I think he made a bad choice in a bad situation.  It might have been the best choice at the time, I don't know, Im not Clinton, how would I know.  <br>
<br>
However, no matter what, it was still a lie.<br>
<br>
Talk all you want at me, but I don't see how thinking that lying is wrong is a bad thing.  You may choose to lie anyways - but knowing right from wrong is very very important in life.<br>
<br>
As for teaching your children about GOOD and BAD lies - don't you want your children to know right from wrong?<br>
<br>
What you teach them, they WILL learn.<br>
<br>
If you teach them it is ok to lie in certain situations, they will APPLY that principle.<br>
<br>
Then you might get :the day they come home and decide it'd be a good idea to lie to you about having sex because it might upset you, even though its your daughter and she's only 13 and doesn't know much about birth control.  Or when they drive home drunk and lie about it because it might make you angry, thats justified isn't it? After all, they had no choice, they might have *gasp* got into trouble for doing something against the law.  <br>
<br>
Of course not, and I hope you think these things are wrong as well, and that lying would be wrong as well in these situations.  <br>
<br>
So where do you draw the line Lurikeen?  How do you teach your child the difference between the right and wrong situation to lie in?  You teach them there are degrees of lying??  And what about other isses that will arise?  Like drugs?  Sex?  Murder?  Are there degrees for these as well?  And how will a 15 year old know when he's reached the point of no return??  <br>
<br>
If all you teach are situational ethics, then how do you teach the difference between right and wrong?  What do you base it on?  <br>
<br>
I just don't agree.  I think lying is wrong, and I don't think that applying situational ethics changes that.     <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ulurikeen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lurikeen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 167<br> <font color=#E9D756>(12/30/01 11:43:07 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=238.topic&index=53>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Lukaria</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> &quot;Of course I ignored your post, it was purposely rude, anyone could tell that.&quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

This will not be a flame war. I guarantee it. Thank you for responding you made some good points. I want to say that it is also rude that Congress could ask a President if they had felatio performed on them in the privacy of their home or office. Don't you? I think Congressmen who asks such questions are being purposefully rude. Just as I baited you, they baited Clinton. Pause and think about how you felt at reading my questions, now think why we should allow a public figure to be humiliated publicly like Clinton was. I don't think it is right. My apologies for being so rude. I wanted to drive a stake into the heart of the matter for clarity.<br>

<br>
Ok... we are going to disagree here. I think he had no choice. I think he and his staff of lawyers knew he would be baited just as I baited you. Guess what, he was. The world is not comprised of people who see &quot;right and wrong&quot; as being as clear cut as you see it, Lukaria. Most people are pragmatists and think the ends justify the means. Furthermore there is a principle here worth supporting. Namely, why should our President ought to divuldge private affairs before a congressional hearing? Monica never came forward and pressed charges. So why even ask? This was dirty politics from the beginning and Clinton had every right to lie in my opinion and it was good that he lied. I would have, too.<br>

No, &quot;black/white&quot; reasoning is not taking a stand on something one believes in. Black and White reasoning is saying things like &quot;Lies are always wrong no matter what&quot;. Is it wrong for me to lie to a killer who enters my house and I tell them that my children are with the grandparents knowing that my silence would force a search of the house?

Ah, the old &quot;Camel's Nose in the Tent&quot; argument. If the Camel puts its nose into the tent then you wind up with the whole Camel in the tent eventually. The fallacy is thinking that if unless everything is black and white then there is no morality at all. I would certainly not provide the same punishments to all law breakers and I certainly don't provide the same type of praise to all those who do good deeds. Why do you think that justifying moral actions leads to acts such as killing Grandma? It is like those who think that smoking marijuana leads to shooting up heroin. I know people who have smoked pot for years and never drank alcohol let alone shoot up! See, we are back to your black/white reasoning. A prime example.<br>

Telling Grandma that she looks good when you know she is an ugly fat person is a &quot;good&quot; lie. Telling the police you had nothing to drink when pulled over for a DWI is a &quot;bad&quot; lie. Why? Because of the effect of the lie. Yes, sooner or later we get caught telling lies. Grandma knows she is an ugly wench so will never want to catch grandchildren lying. She winks at the lie. The police want to catch you lying if you are driving drunk and get caught and lie. They jail you with your lie. See the difference? There is no reward to telling dangerous (bad) lies. That is, there is no moral good that results let alone any good. Lies that can be morally justified are lies that can and should be told. If my daughter could morally justify why lying to me about having sex at age 13 is OK then more power to her. I would let her know that I failed as a parent to discuss with her why she can talk to me about sex. More importantly, did I ever talk to her about sex. The question is then why did she lie? <br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> &quot;If all you teach are situational ethics, then how do you teach the difference between right and wrong? What do you base it on?&quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
An excellent question, Lukaria! I really mean that. =)<br>
<br>
I teach my children that you can weigh the difference between right and wrong based on the effects actions have on others. For example, (and I use the example with my children) if one walks out into the street and smacks down a bystander they are doing something wrong. However, if the bystander asks to be smacked down (since they love pain) and you consent to it, then by all means take liberty at inflicting pain if so inclined. Indeed, I think some have &quot;rough sex&quot; and enjoy it.<br>
<br>
The point is that rational creature have the capacity to judge what effects there actions have against a scale of what is morally permissable. I teach my children that the &quot;laws of the land&quot; is the outline of the scale and fill in the &quot;gaps&quot; with my family's traditions. It is late so I will leave this here. Please do offer ideas about my thoughts. I welcome them. =)<br>

<br>
I am too tired to reply atm except for one thing - <br>
<br>
I think the main difference here Lurikeen is that I have a moral standard in which I believe and one which i strive to adhere to.  I feel certain things are morally wrong because of the effect they have upon each of us as people, on our relationships, on the world, and on our spirit.  Committing these moral wrongs may be justified in cases, and the temporary result of them may indeed be &quot;good.&quot;  I stated this before again and again, but you chose to ignore this.  <br>
<br>
You still miss the point.    <br>
<br>
Absolutely, I feel that lying is morally wrong.  In all cases.  However, if you are asking would I lie to protect the life of my child - yes of course I would. It would still be a lie, and morally, be wrong, but I would choose to lie yes.  Choosing it in order to have a good result does not change the nature of the moral - I believe it is morally wrong to lie.  Period.  <br>
<br>
It is idealistic, of course we all will still lie, but if we have no ideal or moral that we shouldn't lie, then where do we lower our standards to?<br>
<br>
Do you now understand?<br>
<br>
We are talking about two choices in how you live your life really.  Do you have a moral standard and follow it, or do you allow popular trends to dictate right and wrong?  I am not talking laws I am saying popular thought (you know like mini skirts - here today gone tomorrow).<br>
<br>
Last point to make tonight - you took my Clinton statement out of context.  Go back and reread it.  In context, you will see that when I state I would answer the questions if asked, I was referring to a congressional hearing.  Not a public message board.  I never stated I liked the fact that Clinton was asked these questions, in fact I stated the contrary.  I also feel it was dirty politics.  If you read carefully, you will see that.  What I argued was the point that lying is wrong and he did not HAVE to lie.  You disagree with that, fine.  you think the situation forced him to lie, fine.  I don't agree.  Yay, we are all happy to disagree, whoopee, move on.  Your point is not valid Lurikeen about my not answering your personal, rude questions.  I am not the President, and you are not part of a congressional hearing.  Choosing not to answer you is not an indication that I couldn't handle it, its an answer in and of itself Lurikeen.  I will not answer those questions in this forum.  Take me to court and i'll answer if asked and if I swore to tell the truth.  <br>
<br>
You should definitely see the difference here.<br>
<br>
More some other time if I feel like it.  Personally, I think we've exhausted the conversation.  You've stated what you believe and Ive stated mine.  Mine may be stricter or more idealistic, but its no less valid than yours.<br>

<br>
First, I agree with the statement &quot;...certain things are morally wrong because of the effect they have upon each of us....&quot; I think I had stated as much early on.<br>
<br>
I believe that we disagree on what constitutes a &quot;moral&quot;. I think a &quot;moral&quot; is a principle relating to a set of principles, values, and virtues; a.k.a. a system of Ethics. I see our disagreement turning on a perception of what each other's system of ethics may look like. Here is an example:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> &quot;We are talking about two choices in how you live your life really. Do you have a moral standard and follow it, or do you allow popular trends to dictate right and wrong? I am not talking laws I am saying popular thought (you know like mini skirts - here today gone tomorrow).&quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I believe you think that because I am an atheist I do not follow a &quot;moral standard&quot;, that some how I just follow &quot;popular thought&quot;. Of course, I don't know what you mean by &quot;moral standard&quot; so I think that you are following a system of ethics based upon a literal interpretation of the Bible. I think somewhere in &quot;there&quot; is a source of confusion and we are not really seeing what the other is saying. So let me work from my assumptions for the moment... <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> &quot;Last point to make tonight - you took my Clinton statement out of context. Go back and reread it. In context, you will see that when I state I would answer the questions if asked, I was referring to a congressional hearing. Not a public message board.&quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Your point is well taken. Under oath you are saying that you would in fact answer the question. I believe we are talking past each other on this point after reviewing the previous posts. So let me clear up my end. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I am saying that you found the questions I asked rude and insulting. I asked if you would really answer them before a congressional hearing, and doubted you would based upon your responses (I believe the distinction you make between answering such questions in a public forum or under oath really trivializes the nature of the point I was making: such questions are improper no matter where asked and do not deserve an answer). I also pointed out that such questions being asked of the President is equally as rude and should not have been asked to begin with. Dirty politics.<br>
<br>
I think we both agree that the questions should not be asked of the President (or similar questions), again &quot;dirty politics&quot;. We disagree over the end result if the questions are asked. You seem to be saying that the President was morally bound to answer such questions &quot;truthfully&quot;. No other answer would be &quot;right&quot; or &quot;good&quot;. In the case of Bill Clinton there was really only two options: answer the question &quot;truthfully&quot; or obfuscate the issue by telling a lie under oath. Silence is not an option in a congressional hearing. Especially if you are the President of the USA. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  We are going to disagree on the &quot;lie&quot; bit due, in part, because we are mutually confusing each other's view on ethics (very easy to do in a forum like this). Also, we percieve the &quot;moral world&quot; from two very different ethical systems. Neither the twain shall meet, I think. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  However, I believe that Clinton was right in trying to confuse the issue with his answer. I base my view over his lie in part on the point that the asking of the questions was not permissable and should never have been asked. I also believe that any red blooded married man who loves his family should lie to the grave about sexual impropriety to protect the reputation of his family, if he can get away with it. Why? Sex outside of marriage is a trivial thing and is not morally blameworthy. Hence should not be used as a test of morality. The only reason why there is a problem with sex outside of marriage is that the predominate moral view over sex in the USA is based upon an antiquated Puritan principle that sex is a necessary evil resulting from the fall of Adam and Eve. Recall that the view is Eve was cursed by God to bear children because of her sinful act at tempting Adam with the fruit of the Tree, hence the act of impregnation is &quot;evil&quot;, too.<br>
<br>
At any rate, the act of sex between consenting adults is not a moral act at all. It is simply a pleasurable biological function (again, some see &quot;pleasure&quot; as evil, too). I believe it is wrong to politicize sex, let alone force the issue of monogamy as some moral litmus test on our politicians. Knowing that many politicians like to appeal to Puritanical views over the &quot;morality&quot; of sex for political gain, I would have justified lying about the blow job from Monica, too, had I been Bill Clinton.<br>
<br>
I know we will disagree, Lukaria. I wanted to reiterate some points only for the sake of clarity. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>Lurikeen Mali'Kyre<BR>
