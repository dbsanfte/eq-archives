Still, what Chieling did was blatantly and unequivocably wrong.  No matter which way you look at it, it stinks.  Trying to get him banned eh?  Well...good.  I'm not the vengeful or resentful type, but that kind of shit should be bannable. <p>"Innnndeeeeeed!"<BR>

<br>
I have to wonder, Iceclad is a HUGE zone...why an enchanter would mez a mob right next to someone and then run off is beyond me.  Usually running around w/ a few /yell is a pretty good indication if that person gives a flying flip about saving your hide or not.<br>

  Cyril and Gloriana are my friends as well, and I too feel that they'd never screw anyone over for something like this.  There's always two sides to the story.<br>
<br>
  However, SOMEONE handed in the item to spawn the captain.  That person was NOT the same person who 'conned' Storm's Fury into giving them the quest reward.<br>

A friendship isn't a friendship if it can't weather a few storms.  My comment wasn't to imply that everyone in your guild was gonna be held responsible in my eyes for the actions of a few, but I will hold those that were at the incident very responsible.<br>
<br>
Whoever it was that was mad about how Berit and Chieling are being portrayed (forgot your name, too lazy to scroll up)- Kinda sad that the way we are portraying them is the way we saw them acting isn't it? Maybe you should reevaluate what you know about these people, because from the way they acted the other day they aren't worth your friendship, you seem like a loyal and nice person, you don't deserve them.  Whether or not they intentionally trained us, they still acted like asses afterwards, Berit in tells and Chieling by looting an item that wasn't his.<br>
<br>
Mazalo- Dunno about you, but if I was going to train someone who might be afk sitting somewhere, I would sure as hell not mez something, I'd just root it behind the person, or even stun it and gate, either way would be faster than waiting for a 3 minute mez to wear off and hoping the person hadn't realised it was there and left before it broke.  As for the /yell stuff, if you knew Land, he doesn't /yell, he deals with his own problems.  I've never known him to ask for help on anything that didn't take 1 group or more of 60s to take out. <p><a href=http://afflictionguild.com/scripts/member.x?username=Aphroditex&charactername=Aphroditex>Aphroditex Dragonfists</a></b>;  Serenity Z'Chaotic<BR>

Does Chieling have the results of the quest?  If so no matter what else happened that was a bad juju thing to do, and like it or not skews others opinions of everyone who associates with him.  If he looted it, no matter what else happened that was wrong. Trying to address the other things doesn't really matter in the scheme of things. <br>

So one night I'm at the library studying for my Ancient Canadien Topological Astrology final and I notice two girls from the cheerleading squad trying to use the Card Catalogue, so its almost closing time and the librarian is in the back putting away some books.  The 2 cheerleaders seemed perplexed and asked me to help them find something.  After explaining the finer points of the Dewey Decimal system and how it makes life easier, I answer their question by leading them to the magazine rack so they can pick up the copy of COSMO.  Happy to find their magazine, they head for the counter, but then are disappointed to find out you cannot check out periodicals. (The Librarian allows me because I check out magazines for the Science Computer Comic Book Gee Club)  I vouche for the ladies and Marge ,she's the Librarian (and also happens to be an Aries, Thank you Professor Yuradumass, Professor of Ancient Canadien topological Astrology)  So we 3 leave the library and the cheerleaders are overjoyed. Thanking me over and over again, they ask how they could ever repay me.  <br>

<br>
first of all i would like to have some of that stuff you are smoking.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
Now about my mad training skills....<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
I was in Frozen Shadow that day. Zoned out and wanted to run to Kael when a Snow Dervish decided to pinch me.<br>
<br>
So i mezzed the Mob and ran to Lodizal spot and saw(not even in the right spot btw) a low level Necro there with an Oracle robe and no guildtag.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
I should shoot myself because i did not realize that....&quot;THIS MUST BE THE MS LODI CAMPER !!&quot;..<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
Anyway i checked down at the beach and in meantime the mez on the Dervish broke and those damn bastards don't forget you <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
So i run back up there and he is coming for me. The sissy i am i mez him again and heck i did not realize i mezzed him 1 Lightyear away from the necro.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
<br>
Then i ran to the Bridge and hear via shout &quot;YOU JUST TRAINED JENNY !&quot; Jenny ? Jenny who ? Jenny Wong ?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
Then i asked you in tells what the hell you are talking about. Later i think i called you a dick. I think i called you a dick because you acted like a dick, i think.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
If you sat there invis, you should have maybe just killed the Mob and not yell all over the Zone and make a big stink  <br>
about it.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
You agree ?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
I already forgot this crap but i still think it was somehow funny.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
YOU JUST TRAINED JENNY ! will always be one of my favourite ones.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
BTW it's all Hothgar's fault, i grouped far too often with him...<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
And the funny thing is...about 4 Weeks later a combined force of Affliction and MS People killed Lodizal together and acted like grown up People.<br>
<br>
Kudos to Frael for that.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>

Amazing how shit looks different from some one elses perspective isnt it?   What seems like a simple set of coincidences to one person, looks like intentional training to another.  <br>
<br>
Your response on this thread is much more PC than your response at the time of the incident.  Quite believable.  <br>

Well, he's obviously got some beef with us.  Not that I give a damn about Hothgar personally; he plays his game, I play mine.  It's just when I see people make snide comments about my guild, I like to know why.<br>
