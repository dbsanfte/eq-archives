I would have to say that I was in Jeka's group when this happened and was to busy fighting for my life to petition the GM to finalize this stuff.  Since I have spent some time in LGUK lately this kind of stuff from Radic is Repeated every night it seems .  I do not like to post on this SHIT LIST forum, but after reading this thread I have realized that this boy is a arse! It is players like him that makes this game sometimes unenjoyable!  I urge everyone that if this happens again that they contact a GM and refer them to this thread so that they will no RADIC has a bit of a habit at this.  I urge all players of LANYS to outcast this player and warn all your friends! That is how we take care of these situations! <p><B>Ellricc Veinslicer</B><BR><BR><I>Lieutenant</I><BR><BR><B>Order of the Ebon Tear</B></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/urivaliant.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Rivaliant</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>n00b!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(12/7/00 5:49:50 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=235.topic&index=66>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> EEKK RADIC DRIVE ME NUTS!!!!</span><hr size=1> Was helping his group of 3 kill a drovarg sentry in karnors just to be nice and he /shouts STOPS KS'ings ME VENSE to the zone .... hhmm how the hell would I ks them was the first concern and why would you do that.. .

I thank you for your post ... but I still will not budge on my stance ... not that your post doesn't allieviate the tention  of the one Hate incident ... but I have quite a bit of screenshots of me and Radic's alt talking ... (the point is - if you really want proof - I can bear it) and a) the continued tirade about retirement ... I hope he KEEPS his word THIS TIME ... b) A paraphrase to the effect of ... 'I have limited time - and I am not about to die for anyone ... that is why I train' - I understand trains happen Radic - believe me - I do ... but to be so SELFISH as to NOT think that other peeps are on a limited time frame - YOU ARE WRONG.  Train me - I have some time ... but peeps like my brother who is a dad of 3 ... he gets 2 hours in the afternoon for their nap time - and when you train him - CR is about his game play. (This was his FIRST incident that I am aware of training Lower Tower into Ass/Sup - yes - up the freaking ladder) ... c) don't play me with tells like &quot;Come on ... what do Paladin's stand for ... see ... I would never train ... I am a Paladin&quot;  - what faulty logic ... and on top of that - you admited later that you didn't have time and would train.  You ability to construct an argument baffles me Radic.  Oh yeah - and the &quot;I am a Mormon ... why would I lie&quot;.  Well ... I love Jesus man ... but let me tell you what - I am full of sin ... and people are people ... religion doesn't all the sudden make EVERYTHING a person does disapear and they are all holy and perfect in this age. d)  Why do you always blame your brother ... it is always your brothers fault ... but note ... later you said you would train to save yourself time.<br>
<br>
Needless to say - I did ignore you Radic ... well ... your alt ... sorry - but it really gets old after awhile.  You attempt at trying to prove a point sounds like a scratched record.<br>
<br>
So - I wont be taking Radic ... not only because of his ability to train ... but lack of taking responsibility and constant stream of twisted tales.  That is what makes me not trust him.<br>
<br>
My hope would be that with your alt ... or other characters that you would endeavor to be a different person - or he/she will suffer the same fate bro.  It is sad that anything can really be said here and destroy a persons rep ... but the point of this list is confirmations over time ... and if none exist (*thinks of some recent events with Riders*) the thread gets locked and deleted.  Radic, there continues to be evidence against you.<br>
<br>
&quot;Time to make a choice, Mr. Anderson!&quot;<br>

HOWEVER.<br>
<br>
I did not know the old radic...or the one on this shitlist.<br>
in fact I know him only by his alt...who he created...and vowed he only wanted to start over and for a number of reasons, I am giving him that chance.<br>
<br>
For those who know me well, you know how i dislike &quot;trash&quot; in my guild...the &quot;new&quot; radic, abiet under a new name, is a bit ...energetic, and perhaps is too quick to act instead of think, but no more than my little brother Jonath.<br>
<br>
perhaps patience will go a long way, perhaps the two of them will drive me insane?  /shrug.<br>
<br>
anyhow..the radic i know, past null to me, has been going out of his way to help his new guildmates, and although perhaps he's trying a bit TOO hard to prove he's trying to change...the point remains, he IS trying.<br>
<br>
He is now a probationary Member of MagicksGambit.<br>
<br>
I believe in second chances...and no I dont' want to hear &quot;i gave him a second and a third and a ..&quot;<br>
<br>
Give the kid a break..and a little patience.<br>
<br>
If you ask me, that's all he needed in the first place.<br>
You can't expect a kid to act as an adult.<br>

I would be much obliged if you took Radic off of this list.<br>
He's been very well behaived, even when a angry little ranger tried to razz him for standing too close the the precious GBS spawn.  <br>
<br>
Everyone Else?<br>
<br>
If you have so much as an inkling of a problem with him? tell me asap, or any guild officer.  He gets only this one chance from me...I hope for his sake, and mine, my trust isn't so foolish after all.<br>

Radic?<br>

you had better prove me right.  /HUG.<br>

<br>
I've questioned (radic) Aendiin about his past, and he's admitted he has trained in the past, his big screw ups and things he has done and regrets...however, he 125% assures me he did NOT start that train, he said he was standing, when it happened and everyone blamed him. He did mention a name of someone, and it was that someone who started the accusations of saying Radic was to blame.  He's confessed the horrible guk train, the train on elmfall and others, but I really don't think he caused that hate one <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :/ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":/"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

past is past.<br>
<br>
like i said, he's trying to become a new person.<br>
Don't discourage the kid for trying. It's not a lack of heart or honour, more like perhaps not enough thinking through.  Let's hope that changes. so far he's doing ok. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uplurlanys.showPublicProfile?language=EN>PlurLanys</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://hoseroth.tripod.com/plurdot.jpg BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>h0x0r!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(1/3/01 5:03:55 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=235.topic&index=75>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.geocities.com/dokugatiyohali/gdzsntry.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Leo..or...Xian.</span><hr size=1> Wasn't Radic supposed to quit a few weeks ago? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :\ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":\"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><img src=http://geocities.com/killerkebab/plur1.jpg>

Radic has earned a place in the Shit List. He needs to earn his way off.<br>
<br>
I believe in second chances and all, though, I also believe in accepting the consequences for your actions. Joining a new guild and making a few promises on his word (something that also needs to be earned - the respect that one's word means something) that he will change, should not equate to a free ride.<br>
<br>
When people start seeing more posts like Melodist's, then you may have some ground when claiming he is &quot;a new person&quot;.<br>

If your parents are getting divorced and you are going thru a rough time take time off from this game.  I've been there only i was the one getting a divorce.  It sucks...life sucks but you gotta deal with it and not let your behavior affect others.  I will be the first to admit that it isn't easy not to let your feelings come out in a game like this.<br>
<br>
Some of you may remember me others not.  I was the original Darla here on lanys.  I quit tho because there was no way i could juggle all my emotions and the things i needed to get done and play effectively/be useful to anyone.<br>
<br>
If you continue to play more problems will result.  The problem is you prolly don't even realize what your doing.<br>
Please accept this advice .....i have been there and i'm still waiting to see that light at the end of the tunnel and not be filled with emotion.  I got 3 lil boys who are also suffering.  Time to take a break hon.  Come back to the game when things settle down <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
