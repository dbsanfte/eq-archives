Disillusioned by the fact I felt like a total loser I decided I wanted to join the military. Needless to say, by the persuasion of my parents I returned to school and went to a community college for a year. I worked my ass off to pull good grades in order for me to take the next step in college life in order to go onto a four-year institution. I pulled off a 3.5 GPA my second semester at community college and was able to transfer to the University of Rhode Island as a communications major, which was a total shock to me, given the fact that I was expelled from school....I never would have thought I would one day be able to step foot onto another college. <br><br>Well, one week into URI and I feel horrible. I've been in college for 3 years now and I don't know what I want to do with my life. I've had my whole life to think about my future, I've been able to come up with nothing. So, I made a tough decision, something that I have been thinking about for a very long time. <br><br>I've decided to drop out of college and join the military, and hopefully during or after my enlisted time, go back to college and get a degree in a chosen field of study. <br><br>The last time I asked this question people responded that the Air Force was the &quot;better&quot; of the military branches. <br><br>I want to fly. I always have. Hypocritically speaking, from my paragraph up above, I said I never knew what I wanted to do with my life, well, I don't, I only know that flying has always been a fascination of mine. So here are my questions. <br><br>Will I be able to get into a &quot;flight&quot; program if I don't have a college degree? I've been researching and researching the web, and unfortunatly they all say that &quot;most&quot; military flight operators are officers which have college degrees. <br><br>If not...will I be able to choose a military job that has nothing to do with &quot;flying&quot; for instance...say...a military job as an illistrator or a graphic designer...and after my enlistment period has ended, get my college degree and then be able to take military pilot lessons?<br><br>I also have a criminal record. Well, at least I do in my head, I committed a crime and the file was exsponged from my record, which should mean they burned the file and is no longer in their records. Now, this is where I'm paranoid. If asked if I do have a criminal record, am I suppose to answer yes? Or do I answer no because the file is suppose to no longer be there? Does the military have a way of finding these things out after a file has been exsponged?<br><br>Thanks for reading, if you have answers, please reply. I will most likely have more questions...<br> <p><br>Shnarf <br><i>"A Million bleeding hearts, composing prose in blood, to live and die a thousand times."<i><br><br><img src="http://cuongsy.8m.com/images/shnarf01_copy.jpg" border="0"></a> </p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ubrechtbertolt.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Brecht Bertolt</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 513<br> <font color=#E9D756>(1/27/02 7:38:59 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrreallife.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=269.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Military questions, I need advise...please </span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> I also have a criminal record.

You could also of course gain a degree as part of your service - Go to see a recruiter and explain your situation and ask every question you can think of - write down a list of things to ask beforehand so you don't forget any.

He entered the army, being told that he would be eligable to enter flight school in 2 years.  Eight months later he went AWOL because the government flat out lied to him.

I joined after failing out of college and I was not happy. However I a really bad job in the Navy.<br><br>My advice. Talk to non recuiters....look at what jobs they will offer you and then talk to people who work int hat feild that aren't recuriting. They are the ones who will really tell you the truth about what your job does. Recuriters job is to get you in, some lie, some don't. But the bottom line is it is their job to get you to sign.<br><br>Each branch has it's ups and downs. I can only tell youwhat I had to deal with in the Navy. The quality of life was terrible. You will get put on a ship and let me tell you that is no fun. There are requirements to living off base/ship/barracks etc and sometimes you can't deal with the time you will have to wait before you can afford it. The pay is bad, unless you become an officer or til you hit about e-5. You will not be able to afford to live off base without about 2-3 roommates til then. <br><br>THere is the whole, your opinion doesnt matter anymore too. That is hard for some people to deal with. Even if you could come up with a better way to do things, that doesnt' mean that it is the Navy (or whatever brach) way and you may end up working for people you find your intellectual inferiors. I don't know about you, but that jsut irks me.<br><br>Chose your rate, chose your fate...key words to live by when you are trying to pick a rate/MOS in the services. I was a nuclear electrican in the navy. Let me tell you this, if you talk to the navy and you qualify for this job...DO NOT TAKE IT!!!! I don't care if they throw a lot of money and rank at you. It isn't worth it, get out a cacluator and do the math, you WILL make more money on the outside. And do not fall for the if you want to fly, this is a good way to go. They told this to a lot o people. They claim that if you want to be an officer and fly you will have a better chance being a nuke. WRONG! If you are in a critical rate (ie one they are short handed and can't fill easily) you will never be able to cross rate to something else unless you do soemthing dumb to get yourself disqualified. <br><br>Get it in writting. Do not go in undesignated. Get a job offer in writting befo you sign anything. And make sure it is a job you want to do for the next 4 years. There are not a lot of graphics jobs, but you could be a journilist or photographer. I can't think of anything else really close, but others might know.<br><br><br>Mostly talk about stuff with everyone before signing. And if it sounds like it is too good to be ture, IT IS! Get the bottom line and becareful.<br><br>Good Luck in whatever you decide.  <p>Nickle Ante<BR>Guildmistress  <a href=http://www.skidmore.edu/~mhasselb/AM/AMhome.html>Azure Mist</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uaaediasautumnwood.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aaedias Autumnwood</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 125<br> <font color=#E9D756>(1/28/02 12:10:03 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrreallife.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=269.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: re:</span><hr size=1> i was in the air force for three years for sat com/radio communications and enjoyed the hell outta it, i dropped out of school and one day decided hey im gonna do it. Its only 3 years, ill make decent money, get all my necessites(sp) supplied. I ended up enjoying. As far as flying, i havent seen anyone that wasnt at least a Lt flying and most of em that pay grade went to the academy. If wanna be around planes and such just go get your private pilots license, takes a couple months, a little money and boom you can fly whenever you want to(with an airplane of course). But as far as military, if you can keep your ass clean, not be a smartass and handle basic(air forces is the easiest) then you can handle it. As far as the record thing, if they ask tell the recruiter yes, b/c even expunged juvie things come up on the FBI's background check and that all is considered into your security clearance(that can decide how you advance, what job promotions, etc) be honest and upfront. Myu buddy got in and he had been busted and served adult time for grand theft and auto theft.

Good skills to have as a backup, lotta choices for duty assignment.<br><br>Also, tell your recruiter about the &quot;altercation&quot; ... Not a big deal, unless you DON'T tell anyone and they find out ... and they will find out eventually when setting up a clearance.<br><br>All the services will help you with your college ...<br><br>I work in a CINC, so I've been around all the services.<br><br>As far as quality of life (read: cushiness), Air Force is your best bet, and overall, we probably have the most number of technical specialties, although you'll find them in each branch.  I think the Air Force has the least culture shock of joining a military environment after leading a civilian career.<br><br>Navy's probably the best for travel, if you can handle sea duty.  Great technical fields.  Would be my second choice.  Except for the boomers.  they give me the willies.<br><br>From a college standpoint, the Army has the best thing going.  If you're in it purely for college, I say go Army.  They have a program that'll pay for the schooling you received before you joined.  The Air Force didn't do that for me, and I'm still paying off my college loans.  (I still love the Air Force, anyway).  If you like the outdoors, you'll LOVE the field, heh ... or you could just try to get into an AF mobility unit ... Plus, the Army's got alot of Hummers!  Mmm, Humvees ...<br><br>If you were going to join the Marines, you'd have known it by now.  It's an attitude, a personality/character kind of thing.  If you're gung ho, go for it.  If you don't jump in whole heartedly, though, get ready for hell.  The Marines, without a doubt, have some of the strongest comraderie between service members that I have seen.<br><br>Oh, and don't forget about the Coasties ... The Coast Guard has a lot of unique job experiences, if you're the nautical type.<br><br>That's all I got for j00... hope some of the other EQ'ers from services other than the AF chime in, too.

If they offer you something verbally make sure you get it in writing too. Do yourself and potentially me, a favor and don't join until you are ready to make the commitment.<br><br>I have been in the Navy for 13 years now. I enjoy my job working computer network defense(originally I did, and still do, classified communications). I would agree with those above who advise to stay away from flight line jobs. I have seen several shipmates with permanent hearing loss from working flight decks on carriers.<br><br>A great thing about the military(and I believe the Army still gives you most assistance on this) is the benefits you will get to finish your college education. Tuition assistance, GI bill, free Dantes/CLEP tests are just some of the benefits you get to make yourself more knowledgeable and marketable.<br><br>The thing I like about the Navy is all the places I have seen that I would have never seen as a civilian. Bahamas, Norway, Sweden, Germany, Scotland, England, Ireland, Spain, Cuba, Hawaii, Italy, and Australia are all countries(and 1 state) that I would have probably never been able to see working any other job.<br><br>Just like any other job it has it's cons too. Your first couple of years may find you doing some things you won't be crazy about(cleaning, cleaning and more cleaning). And military life is a nomadic life so you never really get to put down roots in one area for a long time(at least in the Navy, other services may be different).<br><br>Overall I am glad I joined the Navy and, if I could go back and do it over again, I would still have joined.

It isnt that bad and look you get to travel (remeber they jsut sent me to Macedonia!)  If you want to fly you can do that in all 4 of the main services.  In a few you can even choose to do Fixd wing or rotary wing.  You do not need a college degree to do warrant, BUT it is highly recommened that you get one, as it makes promotion easier.  I have been in the Army for 10 years and made E-5 (sergeant) in 99'.  The pay isnt all that good, but it does help.  As an E-5 w/ 10 years in I am making $2,130.10 in base pay.  Thats not that bad but yes there are jobs that pay better.  I like the army as I am getting to travel to place i wouldt normally ( I am going to koera in Jan and then to Germany after my tour there), and you can make some good money if you can get a bonus ( I got $20,000 tax free for reinlisting here =D).  Before you finally decide to join up make sure that you go and look at all the services.  Talk to the recuriters, and if you can find other people in those services to talk to and get info from them.  I work on the chinook helicopter and it is a great job.  In my job we are dont go to the feild alot, dont put up w/ doing all of that &quot;Grunt&quot; shit that most others do, but our job is hard nonetheless.  You will end up working alot of late nights and many early mornings, but when you watch it take off adn realize that they wouldnt be able to if it wasnt for you, you get a nice feeling inside.  if you have any other questions about the Army email me and I will do what I can  to help you out.

Sea duty has been some of the most exciting/boring/best/worst times in my life so far.  I have scrubbed thousands of toilets.

I have been to 16 foreign countries, places that I would have never been able to visit on my own.<br>There is no way words written here can accurately describe the military experience.<br><br>You should listen to what the vets have said.  I would NOT listen to anyone who got kicked out or left their branch of service with anything other than an Honorable (not a General, a big difference) Discharge.  Their opinions will obviously be strongly biased in a much different direction than my own, and usually make little attempt at giving an objective view.<br><br>Get it in writing.  Make sure you know what &quot;job&quot; you will be getting.  Do not enlist without a guarantee of some kind of technical schooling.  (In the navy this is called a guaranteed &quot;A&quot; school.  PUSH to get a guarantee of a &quot;C&quot; shcool as well.)   Information Technology and Computer Systems are a hot commodity in the military right now, and the field is here to stay.  If you are computer savvy, this may be a good area to look into in the military.  Free training, with an excellent opportunity for successful transition back to civilian life if the military life doesn't suit you.  <br><br>There are some very good promotion opportunities within the Navy.  Air Force enlisted promotions are generally slower than that found in the Navy, though it is very rating specific.<br><br>Army paygrades are based on a billet structure that I am not very familiar with, but my understanding is you can find yourself getting demoted through no fault of your own if there aren't enough positions within a certain paygrade range when it comes time for you to transfer.<br><br>Marine Corps is a different life entirely.  Strict discipline and regimen, but they enjoy a esprit d' corps that no other branch has.  Promotion there can vary, but their performance evaluation system is the best in my opinion.  You also need to be extremely dedicated to physical fitness.<br><br><br>Do not hide anything from the recruiters.  If you choose a rating that requires a clearance, and darn near anything does now, it will generally turn up.  It may get by a general background check, but eventually (maybe years later) it will come out, your career is over, and you may be charged with fraud.<br><br>Get as much information as possible before signing anything.<br>Take your time.  Talk to vets AND active duty people before you sign.  Do not let a recruiter pressure you into anything.  Pressure recruiting tactics are supposed to be a thing of the past, but the &quot;non-quota&quot; goals are still what performance evaluations are based on.  The recruiter just wants you in.  He doesn't care if you are scraping seagull crap off a flight deck or if you are learing how to operate a nuclear reactor  (though the latter gets him more points). <br><br>Personally, without a bachelor's degree, I don't think you have a snowball's chance in Hell of becoming a military pilot right off the bat.  The army does allow non-degree Warrant Officers to fly helicopters, so maybe you can look into that.  I've heard there is an EXTREMELY high attrition (washout) rate for the program, and the dropped candidates are still obligated to fulfill their service contract as an enlisted.<br><br>There ARE programs to take top notch enlisted into various officer programs, but they are extremely selective and very competitive.  This may be an option for you in the future, but don't count on it.<br><br>My final recommendation is to STICK IT OUT in college.  Finish your Bachelor's degree, even if the major isn't what your truly desired.  THEN you can talk to officer recruiters.  The pay on the enlisted side isn't bad, but it pales in comparison to the officer side of the house after your first promotion.<br><br>Regardless of whether you enlist or choose to try for an officer program, understand you voluntarily give up many of the rights you now have as a civilian.  The Uniform Code of Military Justice is much harsher than the local, state, and federal laws you must abide by in America now.<br><br>You WILL have supervisors you detest.  You MAY have co-workers who become your best friends.  You very likely will be moved away from your hometown and separated geographically from your current friends and relatives.<br><br>If you have any further questions, feel free to e-mail me at cavmn@snet.net.<br><br>Take care! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/bemarr.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=shadowedspawnhatebringer>Shadowedspawn Hatebringer</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 164<br> <font color=#E9D756>(1/28/02 3:17:04 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrreallife.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=269.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Military accession indecision...</span><hr size=1> &quot;Army paygrades are based on a billet structure that I am not very familiar with, but my understanding is you can find yourself getting demoted through no fault of your own if there aren't enough positions within a certain paygrade range when it comes time for you to transfer.&quot;<br><br>This statement is incorrect.  They will not demote unless you screw up.  The army plans all it's personnel movements to do the best to ensure that there are always open slots in your MOS ( not paygrade) to whereever you are going.  You can have problems getting promoted though.  It took me from when I got Specialist in 94(paygrade E-4) until Mar 99 to make E-5.  It all depends on your job and how many other people there are trying to get promoted.

As I said, I am unfamiliar with the Army promotion system.  I have heard stories about administrative demotions in senior paygrades, in cases where there were only a dozen E-9 billets in one field, so when transferred the member takes a bust to E-8 even though his evals are sat.  If Army planning is anything like Navy planning, this ends up happening now and again in some ratings, though by no means would be SOP.  But as I said, these were mainly sea stories from former Army guys that switched branches to the Navy, so I guess they were BS.  These stories were also pre-drawdown, so hopefully that system is no longer in place if it ever was.<br><br>E4 for 5 years?  OUCH.  While that is a possibility in the Navy, it isn't common in my experience except for a few very tight ratings.<br><br>Shnarf,<br>Speaking of tight ratings (those where promotion is slow due to the small number of people in that field, or where the field is overmanned at one specific rank),  anything to do with Graphic Illustration or Photography is tough to get promoted in the Navy.  Navy Patternmakers, Lithographers, and Photographer's Mates have some really screwy promotion times, though most of the guys I've met in these areas really liked their jobs, even knowing they weren't going to get promoted as fast.<br><br>Another really HOT field is security right now, in light of the events on 9/11/01.  All branches are increasing their numbers in these areas right now.  Many of my friends (fellow Sonar Techs) who went to shore duty to an instructor billet have been sideswiped and turned into members of the Auxiliary Security Force (ASF) because of the heightened security posture.  This is one more example of the &quot;Needs of the Navy&quot; taking precedence over your own personal desires.<br><br>Once again, THINK about what you are getting into.  It is very easy to back out in the first 180 days after you sign on, though if you do it means you will never serve in the military again, even in time of war.  After that period, it is tough to get out (honorably) even if you are completely miserable.<br><br>FINISH college.  Look at an ROTC program at your university.  Take a class or two in this area.  Easy to back out of that w/ no pain, and while it isn't really the military, it will give you a taste.<br><br>Good Luck,<br>Frekkels <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ushnarfshnarf.showPublicProfile?language=EN>shnarf shnarf</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_ninja.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 358<br> <font color=#E9D756>(1/28/02 8:37:10 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrreallife.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=269.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Military accession indecision...</span><hr size=1> Thanks for the advice Kidin, I appritiate you detailed information.<br><br>I actually already dropped all of my classes today and filled out a form for withdrawl.

I was also a Nuclear Electrician, but I think I had the best job in the world.  Yes it was hard work, yes I had to do things I did not enjoy, and yes sometimes you work for idiots (although I dont see how this differs from civilian life much).  The thing that does differ is that the Navy took an 18 year old kid who didn't have a clue what to do with his life and didn't have the money (or the grades) to go to college, trained him to maintain, operate, and ultimately supervise others in operating a nuclear power plant.  It turned me into a man with marketable skills that can be used in civilian life.  You don't have to stay as long as I did, but you may find that the job is rewarding and you want to.  I have now entered a new career as the Plant Maintenance Manager of an industrial plant in South Carolina at slightly higher pay than I made as a Senior Chief (E-8)  but with my retirement also, the pay increase is significant.  I will tell you something that many people do not believe but is absolutely true, I have never met anyone who was in the service (any branch) and did not get kicked out, who after 5 years did not wish that they had stayed in.  The comment always goes like &quot;I would be just about eligible for retirement right now....&quot; so take that for what it is worth.

The guys I knew in SF all get out after 4 years for jobs in law enforcement.  It's practically a sure thing that a job as a cop is waiting for you if you keep a clean record.  The SF guys I knew were happy with it for the most part, and there's some comraderie there, that I have seen.  My personal advice to you is only take this option if you're interested in a law enforcement career.  The hours you work are long, odd hours, and alot of the time you'll be bored on watch.  If it's something you're not interested in, you won't be very happy.  Remember, when the recruiter pushes this on you, you don't have to take it.<br><br>I'm a 3COX1 (Computer Operator), and I do Network Architecture, Systems Administration, Web Development (and more) ... Eventually, I'll probably have all the skills I need for an MSE certification.  I work steady hours, and have time for college courses.  I've seen a few guys get out after 4 years to take jobs at places like Compaq doing Sys Admin work on Web Servers.  We're a critical field, high enlistment/reenlistment bonuses.  I really like/recommend this field, and I'd suggest holding out for it.  I had to wait 3 months from the time I approached the  recruiter til the time I shipped out to get it.
