<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
<br>
&quot;Fahrenheit 451,&quot; Ray Bradbury's famous novel of a totalitarian future where books are burned is being acted out in England. But instead of destroying books, authorities seek out and destroy guns owned by citizens in defiance of the national ban. <br>
<br>
Those who remember Bradbury's book know the way that subtle alterations of terminology and a slow erosion of common sense can pervert an entire society to the point that it destroys itself in the quest for perfection. In this case, the perfection they seek is a society without violence, but like all utopian experiments this one, too, is doomed to failure.<br>
<br>
A chilling article appeared recently in the Sun describing how several ordinary, middle-class men were arrested for keeping guns hidden in their homes in violation of the ban. The article was loaded with propaganda terms reminiscent of Bradbury's imagination. Two retired teachers were called &quot;gun-mad,&quot; &quot;gun obsessives&quot; and &quot;gun nuts.&quot; Other arrestees were an engineer and fireman. A photo of Dunblane murderer Thomas Hamilton, labeled &quot;monster,&quot; was included to further vilify and stereotype the violators.<br>
<br>
It is fascinating to read the growing flood of news reports in the British press about the exploding rate of violent crime in the UK, especially gun crime. Many stories about gun crimes mention the harsh gun laws enacted after the &quot;Dunblane Massacre&quot; in 1996. The reporters seem perplexed at the failure of these laws to reduce crime, but never seem to make the connection that would occur to most Americans. <br>
<br>
Scholars Joseph Olsen and David Kopel pointed out a few years ago the uncanny relationship between the enactment of English gun laws and subsequent increases in crime. Even a small child could look at the 100-year graph showing the crime rate vs. gun laws and see the tragic conclusion.<br>
<br>
A new book by respected history professor Joyce Lee Malcom explains how twin attacks on gun rights and self-defense rights have made England into the most crime-ridden country in the developed world.<br>
<br>
The strictest gun laws on the planet have effectively disarmed law-abiding citizens, allowing criminals to run amok with illegally owned guns, knives and even fake guns. Instead of a gun-free society, they have created a situation where guns are more useful and valuable to criminals than ever before. A thriving black market imports guns from Eastern Europe and distributes makeshift guns produced by local craftsmen out to make a quick pound.<br>
<br>
'In the Land of the Blind, the One-Eyed Man Is King'<br>
<br>
Criminals are now certain that citizens have no effective means to resist an armed attack. The gun-armed criminal is thus a king free to rape and plunder at will. <br>
<br>
At least Britain deserves credit for thoroughness. In contrast with American practice, where the rich and famous are effectively exempt from gun laws, English gun controls are so tight that even celebrities are unarmed, leading to many reports of celebrity mansion burglaries and street assaults.<br>
<br>
Attempts to counter this avalanche of crime with more police are hampered by limited budgets and a liberal criminal justice system. Thousands of video surveillance cameras have sprouted everywhere, reducing privacy but failing to provide the desired protection.<br>
<br>
Laws against self-defense have sent to jail Englishmen who would have been hailed as crime-fighting heroes in America. Years of expenditures and sacrifice have simply created the world's safest working conditions for criminals. <br>
<br>
Instead of repealing the counterproductive laws, English politicians prefer to pile on more laws outlawing knives, air guns and toys. Their utter faith in government and their complete ignorance of human nature is stunning.<br>
<br>
Americans have good reason to point at our English cousins and laugh as they laughed at us during the era of alcohol prohibition, but I suggest we thank them for conducting one of the great social experiments of our time. By showing the counterproductive nature of gun control, they are teaching us a powerful lesson. We can only hope they see the light before their society is too badly damaged.<br>

<br>
&quot;ordinary middle-class men&quot; is a rather misleading term, used here as a form of propaganda. These men have broken the law. They are criminals. The Sun probably reflects the view of the majority of &quot;ordinary&quot; UK citizens, being horrified at the collection of illegal weapons. From the slippery slope article you've referenced:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE HTML START--> <font color=yellow>Legal British gun owners now constitute only four percent of total households, with perhaps another small percentage of the population possessing illegal, unregistered guns...<br>
<br>
seventy-six percent of the population supports banning all guns.<br>
<br>
Approximately half of American homes contain a gun, and a quarter contain a hand gun.</font><!--EZCODE HTML END--><br>
<br>
... reinforcing that what may be considered ordinary middle-class behaviour in the US is certainly not in the UK.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE HTML START--> <font color=yellow>look at the 100-year graph showing the crime rate vs. gun laws and see the tragic conclusion.</font><!--EZCODE HTML END--><br>
<br>
So I went looking for 100 year graphs. But I didn't find one, so I had to find some raw data and draw up a graph myself. Here's graphs of homicide rates in US, UK and NSW.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://users.alwaysonline.net.au/mnettle/tmp/homicide.gif"><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>
<br>
Unfortunately, the very high US homicide rates have scaled the graph such that it's not so easy to see the marked drop in homicide rates in NSW and UK around the time of the introduction of gun control laws in the 1920s. I'll cut and paste the following from a previous post I've made on this topic:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> The effects of introduction of gun control laws on crime rates:</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<!--EZCODE CODE START--><pre> 
         11-14  21-30 change  Prob. chance could

USA       7.52  8.58  +14     0.006
</pre><!--EZCODE CODE END--><br>
This shows the homocide rates averaged in 1911-1914 and 1919-1920 vs 1921-1930 in several countries. 1915-1918 is excluded as the homocide rates in countries other than Japan dropped markedly with many young males overseas.<br>
<br>
Gun control laws were introduced in England and NSW (40% of Australian pop.) in 1920, in Victoria (30% of Australian pop.) in 1921, and Queensland (15% of Australian pop.) in 1927.<br>

<br>
The correlations between gun ownership and <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> violent</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> crimes look obvious, and it seems to be uncorrelated to the crime rates for the less violent crimes. I believe that these correlations are only moderatly statistically significant in most cases. It would be foolish to jump from this data and say that gun ownership causes these crimes. There are more factors to crime rates than gun ownership. The correlation between gun ownership and the chance that a burgler will wait till a home is vacant before entering is there, but not too statistically significant either. I don't have the stats skills to tell you what &quot;statistically significant&quot; means in this context. <p>----------------------------------<br>

  Thank you for the detailed information. I too have done a little digging and have found basically the same statistics. It does indeed appear, given the recent adoption of concealed weapon laws in the US, that homicide by way of firearm is going down while raising in the UK (banning firearms).<br>
<br>
The biggest evidence of this is in population per violent firearm related death. <br>
<br>
UK 2001 population approx. 60 million<br>
Approx. death per violent firearm related death = 1,900<br>
One in every 32,000 +\- citizens commit a violent crime with a firearm (decreasing at a lesser rate).<br>
<br>
US 2001 population approx. 285 million<br>
Approx. death per violent firearm related death = 9,800<br>
One in every 29,000 +\- citizens commit a violent crime with a firearm (decreasing at a faster rate).<br>
<br>
Unless my math is busted, it seems that the US averages approx. 1.1 percent higher per population in firearm related crimes then the UK.  <p><B><font color=#00dd00>Rh</font><font color=#00cc00>ea</font><font
