They even knew where but claim they didn't have any specific info on who they were...BS!<br><br>Just give us, the American people, all the friggen facts and warnings so we can decide if we want to travel by plane or by auto or walk! Don't hoard this information behind closed doors to only make the assumption of &quot;Guess we will know when it happens..&quot;<br><br>If the US government doesn't start fore-warning the people of this nation... foreign terrorist attack will be the least of their concerns. People will begin to seriously rebel if they start to think that the people who they pay, with their hard earned tax dollars, are not protecting them or giving them warning when they have it.<br><br>Below I provided a small article for those whom may feel inclined to jump and push this all onto Bush. Yes, this is a right-wing article, but it makes some interesting points and it gives us some insight on how our government works... very scary.<br><br>We like to think that they are totally &quot;all over it&quot; all the time... and they are not.  Even when they have info they still don't have a clue (and in some cases, any concern).<br><br>Bush pleads innocence (Mr. &quot;The buck stops here&quot;)..<br>Clinton pleads &quot;no contest&quot;<br>FBI says they are innocent<br>CIA says they are innocent<br>Daschle wants more information (all the damn time)<br>and..<br>The real innocent ones, the US citizens, get the punishment.<br><br>/rant rant rant!<br><br>/calms<br><br>Here is the article.. It is some good Clinton bashing, yes. But it tells the story of HOW LONG and HOW MUCH TIME we had to INVESTIGATE.<br><br><br>_________________________________________________<br>If you don't recall seeing the blaring post-9/11 headline &quot;Clinton Warned on Bin Laden Hijack-Kamikaze Plot,&quot; it's not because your memory is failing. <br><br>In fact, the big media mostly ignored the story - in marked contrast to today's wall-to-wall coverage of news that President Bush received a pre-9/11 CIA briefing on a possible bin Laden hijack plot.<br><br>And while the warning transmitted to Bush gave no inkling that bin Laden planned to transform U.S. airliners into flying bombs and slam them into American office buildings, Clinton administration intelligence officials were in fact in the possession of detailed information on an al Qaeda conspiracy to hijack several U.S. airliners - including a plan to crash one of the planes into the Pentagon or CIA.<br><br>It was called &quot;Operation Bojinka,&quot; a 1995 plot hatched by an al Qaeda cell in the Philippines with an eye toward blowing up 12 American airliners. Some would be booby-trapped with bombs, like Pan Am 103, others hijacked like the four U.S. jets commandeered on 9-11 and crashed into buildings.<br><br>Though the mainstream press never demonstrated much enthusiasm for the story, Accuracy in Media's Reed Irvine detailed what the Clinton administration knew - and when it knew it - for NewsMax.com last October.<br><br>Citing a Sept. 13 Agence France-Presse report, Irvine noted that Philippine Police Chief Superintendent Avelino Razon had uncovered the plot to &quot;plant bombs in U.S. airliners and hijack others to crash them into buildings like the CIA headquarters.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Razon said [the plot] was found on the computer of Ramzi Yousef, the organizer of the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center,&quot; Irvine reported. &quot;He had fled to Pakistan, but his laptop was found in the apartment he shared with his accomplice, Abdul Hakim Murad. Razon said both were agents of Osama bin Laden.&quot;<br><br>A later Agence France-Press report noted:<br><br>&quot;Among targets mentioned [in Yousef's computer files] was the World Trade Center in New York ... CIA offices in Virginia and the Sears Tower in Chicago.&quot; <br><br>Picking up where Irvine left off, the Washington Post quoted a Filipino investigator who said that as he watched the attack on the World Trade Center on television, he exclaimed in horror, &quot;It's Bojinka. We told the Americans everything about Bojinka. Why didn't they pay attention?&quot; <br><br>Razon told the Philippine Daily Inquirer that after the the Philippine intelligence report was compiled in 1995, it was passed on to the U.S. Embassy and the U.S. Joint Task Force on Terrorism. <br><br>But, he complained, &quot;It was not given credibility. Otherwise, it could have prevented the destruction of the World Trade Center.&quot;<br><br>The Clinton FBI was in full possession of all the frightening facts on Bojinka, but did nothing. Instead, as Reed Irvine revealed, the bureau assured Congress that everything was under control.<br><br>&quot;In testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee subcommittee on terrorism in February 1998, 'Bojinka' - which means 'big bang' - was described by Dale L. Watson, chief of the International Terrorism Operations Section of the FBI, only as a plot to blow up 'numerous U.S. air carriers.'<br><br>&quot;He said that the FBI had identified 'a significant and growing organizational presence' of foreign terrorists in the United States. He swore the bureau had them under control.&quot;<br><br>The Clinton FBI counterintelligence chief told the Senate that as a result of the bombings of the World Trade Center in 1993 and the Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City in 1995, the FBI had developed an 'enhanced capability' to track terrorist activities.<br><br>Is it likely that U.S. intelligence possessed this much information on al Qaeda plans to slam planes into U.S. buildings - and didn't tell President Clinton?<br><br>Actually it is, if you believe the account of his former CIA Director James Woolsey, who said Clinton never bothered to meet with him during his stint as the nation's intelligence chief.<br><br>What about other administration officials, like Attorney General Janet Reno, who certainly should have known about Bojinka?<br><br>There Clinton may also have an alibi. <br><br>During all of 1998 - the same year FBI counterintelligence briefed Congress on the al Qaeda hijack plot - Clinton met with his Cabinet exactly twice: once in January to lie to them about his relationship with Monica Lewinsky, and again in August to come clean about the affair.<br><br> <p><B><font color=#00dd00>Rh</font><font color=#00cc00>ea</font><font color=#00bb00>to</font><font color=#00aa00>n</font> <font color=#009900>St</font><font color=#009900>or</font><font color=#008800>m</font><font color=#007700>ca</font><font color=#006600>st</font><BR><font color=#00dd00>55</font><font color=#00cc00>th</font> <font color=#00bb00>Se</font><font color=#00aa00>as</font><font color=#009900>on</font> <font color=#008800>Ma</font><font color=#007700>gi</font><font color=#006600>ci</font><font color=#005500>an</font><BR><font color=#00dd00>Co</font><font color=#00cc00>un</font><font color=#00bb00>ci</font><font color=#00aa00>l o</font><font color=#009900>f U</font><font color=#008800>nb</font><font color=#007700>ro</font><font color=#006600>ke</font><font color=#005500>n H</font><font color=#004400>on</font><font color=#003300>or</font></B><BR><a href="http://unbrokenhonor.homestead.com/" target="_blank"><img src="http://unbrokenhonor.homestead.com/files/rheaton5.jpg" border="0"></a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uxurion.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Xurion</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#E9D756>(5/17/02 6:31:20 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=299.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Just fvcking tell us, Ok?!</span><hr size=1> maybe i'm wrong but if they tell the public their info the terrorists will be aware of the info as well, therebye making it more difficult to catch the aware individual. if there was some secret pipeline which channelled to america people only then i would be all for that. and i also dont think what i stated is the only reason they dont tell us. it's also to keep mass panic and chaos from occuring.<br><br>Xurion<br>60 Wizard - Retired <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ulithahntalon.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lith Ahntalon</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/image/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 293<br> <font color=#E9D756>(5/17/02 3:40:42 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=299.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Just fvcking tell us, Ok?!</span><hr size=1> I work for the local govenrment, I am a police officer, I am a forensic investigator, I process crime scenes for a living. I will tell you something right now, there are a lot of things the government does not tell you. Why? First, you most likely do not want to hear it. Second and frankly, you do not need to hear it. It may hinder the investigation of a case, it may cause undue panic to the public, it may cause undue pain to victims or survivors of victims, it may let the suspect know we are watching/looking for him, etc. etc. etc. <br><br>My Departmenet is about 400 line officers serving approximatly 250,000 people and communication between the street and investigations can sometimes be a problem. One of our dectectives has a sign on his desk that reads &quot;Somewhere out there a beat officer has the answer to your case, you need only find him.&quot; It is the truth. Field personel make so much contact with the general public on a daily basis and are told so much about what is going on that sifting through what is important and what isn't can be a monumental task. Add onto this fact that if you don't know something is important because no one told you, etc. you get the point. Now this is just in a small agancy. Imagine the amount of informantion gathered by many federal agencies CIA, FBI, NSA, Secret Service, etc. and you get to see the picture. Quite frankly, the federal govenrment is too big and too specialized. Because I am sure these agencies pull in a ton of information and then must sift through it to find what they deem important enough to pass along. A LOT of times much of this information is too general to do anything specific about and the only course of action that can be taken is preventive measures on a wid scale. Problem with this is, it will most likely get noticed by the general public and either cause undue panic (info is not always solid and set in stone), cause some people to theorize worse than the original information (the press excells at this) and cause more panic, or cost money for something that may or may not be true.<br><br>So why not just tell the general public in the form of a general public? Well, read above, people can and WILL cause a panic more often than not, people will criticize if the it is not true and complain about govenrment waste, it could tip off people we are trying to catch thus making them harder to find, etc. I think you get the picture. It is a catch 22 really. You cannot win.  <p><img src=http://eshamlin.home.mindspring.com/lith.jpg></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ulurikeen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lurikeen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 637<br> <font color=#E9D756>(5/17/02 4:13:12 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=299.topic&index=3>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Just fvcking tell us, Ok?!</span><hr size=1> What I don't understand, Rheaton, is just why you are trying to point fingers at Clinton when it was Bush who ignored the warnings? Further, the article you provided seem to be the stuff made for conspiracy theorists and not for those who want to deal with facts.<br><br>The fact is, (and I hate to write this because I would love to see Bush hang) neither Bush or Clinton had enough hard evidence to act on. I think Lith's remarks are dead nuts on (for the most part). Why would the administration alert the public when they really had nothing to go on?<br><br>When I was in college I used to work at a Sandwich shop. Two individuals came in and I could tell they were wearing body armour under their suit coats, so I asked if they were law enforcement. They affirmed as much citing they were FBI agents. I asked what they were doing. They said they were doing their job keeping track of Soviet spies. "Keeping track!" I exclaimed. They both nodded their heads explaining that Washington State had at least a dozen known spies and that they were tracking these spies to see if they turned up moles.<br><br>I had no idea and I doubt anyone else in the commuity knew that we had FBI running around chasing spies. Truthfully, I was comforted just knowing these guys were doing their jobs. I didn't need to know the details. I am sure the details could have possibly been disturbing. <p><center><font face="arial" color="CCFFFF">Lurikeen Mali'Kyre</FONT></center><center><table style='Filter: Shadow(Color=#150517, Direction=225)'><tr><td><span class='Necromancer'><font size=2 color="red" face="arial"><i>NECROMANCER</span></td></tr></table></font></i></center><center><font face=arial></center><center><I>"My eyes will pierce your soul, then I will take your life!"</I></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ulithahntalon.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lith Ahntalon</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/image/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 294<br> <font color=#E9D756>(5/17/02 5:19:10 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=299.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Just fvcking tell us, Ok?!</span><hr size=1> Damn no edit.

If it’s a small town robbery or a national manhunt, it must be VERY difficult to coordinate and execute a plan of action that is fruitful. The examples could go on and on I know.<br><br>Also, I would like to say that am fully aware of the fact that one man, the president, is not responsible. Rather Clinton, Bush or JKF, they all have a very hard job to do daily. Obviously the &quot;point man&quot;, or president, is the one the blame / shame falls on (and should in some cases). The administration in whole and to coordination of such is the key to most answers and problems.<br><br><!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>Second and frankly, you do not need to hear it. It may hinder the investigation of a case, it may cause undue panic to the public, it may cause undue pain to victims or survivors of victims, it may let the suspect know we are watching/looking for him, etc. etc. etc.  <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br><br>I agree with this statement to a certain extent. Sometimes we must be &quot;mums the word&quot; in order to catch the bad guys. However, there is a CONSIDERABLE risk in playing by this rule...and 9-11 is the perfect example. Also, it wasn’t the case with the &quot;suspects&quot; of 9-11....we really had no clues as to exactly who they were. Unlike in Lurikeen's example, the FBI was not keeping tabs on the 9-11 terrorist (spy’s).<br><br>The thinking in &quot;lets not tell anyone for fear of panic or tip-off&quot; works in many cases. Recently in Okla., there was a manhunt for an escaped detainee. The police chief came on the news and said that they really didn’t know where this guy was....2 hours later the escapee was arrested. They didn’t want to tip the guy off and cause him to run. It worked out fine in not telling the public that he may have been in someone's backyard. The reason they didn’t is cause he wasn’t a &quot;violent&quot; criminal and they most likely didn’t consider him armed and dangerous. In that case their plan worked..the &quot;hush hush&quot; plan.<br><br>Since 9-11, we have in place a nice little color-coded warning system. I am guessing that somewhere out there there is a set of cautions attached to each of these colors. &quot;White&quot; for example may mean they have no reason at all to think that something may happen. Red on the other hand may mean &quot;don’t leave your house today&quot;. 3000+ people had to die in order to finally put something like this in place. Why, with all the evidence and information, did we not already have this, or something like this, in place prior to 9-11?<br><br>Post 9-11 has changed the way we live indeed. Yet the threat is and has been the same since what..about 1993? <br><br>The downed aircraft (I can’t remember which flight it was) was brought down by men who had found out via cell phone that planes were being crashed into buildings. This more the likely saved the Whitehouse from being destroyed. In other words...they had warning where as the other people aboard the other airliners had no clue.<br><br>A general alert would have worked fine. A simple &quot;We have reason to believe......yadda.....fly at your own risk&quot; would have at LEAST tipped some people off when the hijackings began. A generalized alert may have kept the terrorist from hijacking that day, but also may have prevented it all together.<br><br>Hindsight is 20/20 I know....but what about foresight? Can we not trust the American people enough to give them warning? Does anyone really think that if they would have issued a general alert or warning that people would have panicked and went nuts? Is it the economy we are protecting moreso then a few hundred people? <br><br>I do not accept the theory that they intended to remain silent in order to catch the terrorist especially since they didn’t know who they were. But what they DID know, or have strong evidence about, is that something was in the making! Something that involved the POTIENTIAL death of at LEAST one airliner full of people....and they didn’t say a word.<br><br>Guys, I'm thinking that it’s better to be safe then sorry. If they had known the terrorist and were monitoring them, that’s one thing....but they (claim) they did not.

Do you sit tight on that information? Do you pass it out? How reliable is the information? How often can you pass that information out and avoid a &quot;boy who cried wolf&quot; syndrome? If you offer enough general warnings people will eventually just ignore them. There is a fine balance to be struck there. There are no clear rules that apply to this kind of thing. <br><br><br>Bottom line, law enforcement's job is to protect the public, sometimes in spite of the public's actions or desires. I know that sounds kind of arrogant but, it is simple fact. Does law enforcement have all the answers? Nope, sure don't. They do they have in most cases at the very least training to deal with situations and in many cases years of dealing with people, situations and experiences that help them do better work to take preventive measures without stepping on the toes of the constitution or the general public. <br><br>I will tell you this, what you see on the local news &quot;crime beat&quot; stories are the tip of the iceberg of what is actually going on in your city. I will give you a perfect example of what I meant by public panic. It does not actually have to be riots and people running in the streets screaming. When the Anthrax mail was first discovered it was HIGHLY publicized our department was FLOODED with calls about every suspicious person, envelope, package, etc. We were called to corners where a UPS or FedEx guy set down a package for a minute while he delivered something else. Of course we have to take these calls serious but, every cook, freak, nut and whacko had a call to make about something, reapetedly. We simply did not have the personel to handle this AND our regular duties. As a result, burglaries, auto thefts, entering autos, etc. rose substantially during this period. Was it a good thing that the Anthrax threat was publicized, in hindsight, yes but it does have results which may not be palatable to most poeple. I am just guessing here but, I bet you would be surpised at how OFTEN something like this most likley crosses any president's desk pre or post 9/11. 99% of the time it is road apples 1% of the time it is not. How do you make a general public notice without desensitizing people? You make these warnings when you have evidence that something will occur or has a very strong possiblity to occur. If not, you simply do not have enough to warrant any ation that is not &quot;behind the scenes&quot; so to speak.<br><br> <p><img src=http://eshamlin.home.mindspring.com/lith.jpg></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ulurikeen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lurikeen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 641<br> <font color=#E9D756>(5/18/02 2:51:56 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=299.topic&index=7>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Just fvcking tell us, Ok?!</span><hr size=1> <i>"Unlike in Lurikeen's example, the FBI was not keeping tabs on the 9-11 terrorist (spy’s)."</i><br><br>Weren't they?

However, we can't then point fingers at Clinton, realistically.

"Conditional thinking" is simply "what if" thinking. We are provided the antecedent for the condition usually from an external source and then iterate consequents for the statement usually to our own loss of sanity. We all know 911 happened and no amount of working through "what ifs" will change it or prevent it in the future. I believe that external threats to the US from rational agents are very hard to predict. Notice, not impossible.<br><br>I believe that the best predictions will result from the fruits of empirical studies (information and fact gathering) of terrorist groups. Even then, I can only guess that such studies would not have given the US enough certainty as to whether or not a 9/11 was in progress. I think we could only know that one was possible. Given the political climate and popularity of tax cuts and slashing the federal budget I doubt seriously the US can find the funds necessary to be proactive and implement preventative measure against terrorist attacks. Even the ramped up airport security is a joke and not a real solution. The difficulty may be in knowing what is the solution. <p><center><font face="arial" color="CCFFFF">Lurikeen Mali'Kyre</FONT></center><center><table style='Filter: Shadow(Color=#150517, Direction=225)'><tr><td><span class='Necromancer'><font size=2 color="red" face="arial"><i>NECROMANCER</span></td></tr></table></font></i></center><center><font face=arial></center><center><I>"Resident Prick with a degree in being a Jerk!"</I></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/urheaton.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Rheaton</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 175<br> <font color=#E9D756>(5/21/02 8:10:28 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=299.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Just fvcking tell us, Ok?!</span><hr size=1> I am by no means trying to say its all Clinton's fault.

Yousef escaped at the time, but agents caught his right-hand man, Abdul Hakim Murad, who told them a chilling tale. <br><br>&quot;Murad narrated to us about a plan by the Ramzi cell in the continental U.S. to hijack a commercial plane and ram it into the CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia, and also the Pentagon,&quot; said Rodolfo Mendoza, a Philippine intelligence investigator. <br><br>Philippine investigators also found evidence targeting commercial towers in San Francisco, Chicago and New York City. <br><br>They said they passed that information on to the FBI in 1995, but it's not clear what was done with it. <br><br>One week ago, two hijacked commercial jets slammed into the World Trade Center, collapsing the towers. Another jet hit the Pentagon and a fourth crashed in rural Pennsylvania. Authorities believe that fourth jet may have been headed for the Capitol or the White House. Thousands were killed in the attacks. <br><br>On Monday, FBI Director Robert Mueller insisted the agency had &quot;no warning signs&quot; of last week's attacks. <br><br>Yousef and Murad both have ties to Osama bin Laden, the man President Bush has labeled the &quot;prime suspect&quot; in Tuesday's attacks. <br><br>Authorities also found on a computer in the Manila apartment details of a separate plot to bomb 11 U.S. airliners on overseas flights. <br><br>Yousef once listed his occupation as &quot;international terrorist&quot; on an ID card, and he has long been considered a disciple of bin Laden. <br><br>Murad was a pilot who admitted he had been trained in Afghanistan as well as the United States. Bin Laden, a Saudi native, lives in Afghanistan. <br><br>&quot;(Murad) was principally recruited by Yousef's group and bin Laden's group to undertake a suicide mission,&quot; said Avelino Razon, superintendent for the Philippine National Police. <br><br>Yousef was eventually caught in Pakistan and brought to New York for trial. He was sentenced to life in prison. Murad is also serving a life sentence. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br><br><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2001/US/09/18/inv.hijacking.philippines/index.html">www.cnn.com/2001/US/09/18...index.html</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br><br>and here is another....<br><br><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A33312-2002May17.html">www.washingtonpost.com/wp...May17.html</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br> <p><B><font color=#00dd00>Rh</font><font color=#00cc00>ea</font><font color=#00bb00>to</font><font color=#00aa00>n</font> <font color=#009900>St</font><font color=#009900>or</font><font color=#008800>m</font><font color=#007700>ca</font><font color=#006600>st</font><BR><font color=#00dd00>55</font><font color=#00cc00>th</font> <font color=#00bb00>Se</font><font color=#00aa00>as</font><font color=#009900>on</font> <font color=#008800>Ma</font><font color=#007700>gi</font><font color=#006600>ci</font><font color=#005500>an</font><BR><font color=#00dd00>Co</font><font color=#00cc00>un</font><font color=#00bb00>ci</font><font color=#00aa00>l o</font><font color=#009900>f U</font><font color=#008800>nb</font><font color=#007700>ro</font><font color=#006600>ke</font><font color=#005500>n H</font><font color=#004400>on</font><font color=#003300>or</font></B><BR><a href="http://unbrokenhonor.homestead.com/" target="_blank"><img src="http://unbrokenhonor.homestead.com/files/rheaton5.jpg" border="0"></a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ulurikeen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lurikeen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 651<br> <font color=#E9D756>(5/21/02 9:33:50 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=299.topic&index=9>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Just fvcking tell us, Ok?!</span><hr size=1> Yup, I have read similar articles.

Shemales and genitals: I present to you some bizarre arse shiit.<br>_______________________________________________<br><br>&quot;While jet fighters drop bombs on Afghanistan in the wake of the World Trade Center tragedy and FBI agents search for the source of anthrax letters, an incredible tale has been unfolding in a Toronto courtroom. <br>  <br>It draws together the threads of a narrative some describe as &quot;stunning and fantastic,&quot; while others wonder if it isn't just the ravings of a lunatic. <br>  <br>The man telling the tale in sworn court affidavits is Delmart Edward Vreeland, who faces credit fraud charges in Canada and in the United States, where officials are attempting to extradite him. <br>  <br>The 35-year-old American claims to be a lieutenant in a U.S. Navy intelligence unit - a spy who says he knew in advance about the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. <br>  <br>In his affidavit, he says he tried to warn Canadian intelligence about possible terrorist attacks on New York and the Pentagon, along with targets in Ottawa and Toronto, but was written off as a petty criminal. <br>  <br>So he wrote the warning on a piece of paper, sealed it in an envelope, and handed it to jail guards a month before the attacks. They opened the letter Sept. 14 and immediately forwarded the information to Ottawa. <br>  <br>His lawyers, Rocco Galati and Paul Slansky, are fighting extradition, telling the court he could face treason charges and the death penalty in the U.S. <br>  <br>In the first stage of hearings, federal prosecutor Kevin Wilson yesterday told Mr. Justice Archie Campbell of the Superior Court of Justice that he was skeptical of Vreeland's claims. <br>  <br>&quot;Is his story possible? I can't go so far as to say it's not possible, but it's not plausible,&quot; Wilson said. <br>  <br>The prosecutor said he has seen no evidence to back Vreeland's claim that Canadian embassy official Marc Bastien was murdered in Moscow in December. Canadian officials said the 35-year-old computer specialist died of natural causes. <br>  <br>So, who is Delmart Edward Joseph Michael Vreeland II? <br>  <br>According to court documents, Vreeland was 18 when he enlisted in the U.S. Navy in 1984. <br>  <br>Two years later, Vreeland says in his affidavit, he joined a special unit investigating drug smuggling into the U.S. by naval personnel. But the navy says Vreeland was &quot;unsatisfactorily discharged&quot; in 1986. <br>  <br>Vreeland also claims he gathered information on a crime family in Detroit and testified against them in 1998. <br>  <br>Late last year, he says, he came to Canada to help smuggle Russian military secrets out of Moscow, including Russia's plan to counter the American 'Star Wars' missile defence system. While in Moscow, Vreeland says, he met Bastien. <br>  <br>Vreeland was arrested by a police fugitive squad nine months ago. While in Toronto (Don) Jail, he met Nestor Fonseca, who was facing drug smuggling charges and extradition to the U.S. The court documents say Fonseca allegedly told Vreeland of his plans to kill a Toronto judge and others. Fonseca was charged with counselling to commit murder. <br>  <br>Galati and Slansky said in the documents that Vreeland should be put into the witness protection program in Canada because he is the main witness against Fonseca. <br>  <br>Galati writes in one document: &quot;Neither myself, nor Mr. Slansky ... have seen anything as incomprehensibly frustrating, inexplicable and irresponsibly absurd. as the RCMP's position that they are not interested in reviewing Mr. Vreeland's information.&quot; <br>  <br>It would appear, Galati says in the brief, that the Canadian and American governments have written Vreeland off as a &quot;nut case,&quot; which he says is a &quot;patently absurd conclusion.&quot; <br>  <br>  <br>With files from Donovan Vincent <br> <p><B><font
