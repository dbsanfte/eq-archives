A guildie made me 2 rebreathers for my epic and was droping them off.  Not knowing that rebreathers needed to be in giant size containers they drop to the ground,  My guildy sees it and picks one up before we have the chance to pick the second one  up,  Newbie_00 sweeps over and grabs it off the ground.  We start asking in ooc for the person to give it back.  That it takes months and 10s of thousands of PP to build the skill needed to make thoose.  No response.  I offer a reward... no response.  I state that the person that picked it up would not be able to sell it due to the fact that there is only maybe 3 people on the whole server that can make them and he is not one of them and would be found out eventually....  bingo,  Newbie_00 shouts the rebreather has been found.  Then I get a tell saying that he wants the reward I offered.  I think,  boy that is f'd up.  But since I offered it I gave him aproximately 1k worth of items as a reward.  We trade and he tells me that he would like me to give him some pp as well.  This gets me pissed.  So I begin to tell him that what he did was wronge that instead of thinking I scored!  He should have just picked it up and asked who droped it.  Biegn a big believer in Karma I tell him to be carefull be cause it would catch up to him,  He begins tell me that he dont think that what he did is wronge.  He considers it survival the fitest.  And he didnt have to come forward ect..  that verant wouldnt consider what he did is wronge and he dont either.  This gets me pissed.  This insignificant little newbie is all messed up.  So I do a guild status on him sence he is anon.  find out that he is is and officer in newbie guild_00.  I do /who all &quot;his guild&quot;  and tell all 3 people that where on at the time what he did. because I know that I for one would like to know if one of my guildies had this shitty attitude.  One of his guidlies trys to make it right with me.  which i apreciate,  but I tell him.  That I really dont care about the items because I consider them strugaling  newbie give aways anyway.  It was his whole attitude that he dont think that what he did is wronge is what made me mad.  A few min later I get a tell from a GM that I have been reported for defiling newbies name.  I explain what happen and at the end of the conversation she tells me that I got my point to his guild and that if this guy ever bugs me again to let her know and she would take care of it.  <br>
Now my question to you all is, did I handle this wronge?  should I have not reported the little thief to his guild?<br>
From my point of view,  I honestly cant believe that he had the nerve to do any thing that he did last nite.  And that he reported me is beyond belief.  As I told the GM,  I should have reported him.  Anyway enough ranting.  <br>

What the hell.  I didn't ask for a spelling lesson.  I was ranting,  it don't have to be coherent.  That's why its a rant.  I know I'm not the national spelling bee champ.  But who cares.  Do I really need to make 3 graphs and make sure everything is spelled correctly and all punctuation is in the right place.  Geese get a life.

I know Allee and Gus BOTH are my friends and I know Gus can stick up for himself <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  and I know Allee did Not mean that to be personal. <br>

<br>
Have you ever heard of spell/grammar check?<br>
<br>
I had trouble paying attention to the content of your post because it just sounded so uneducated.<br>
<br>
now if this was a member of your guild that this *comment* was address to ...you are telling me you wouldn't have anything to say?<br>
<br>
and yeah you are right me telling them to fuck off was no better...but guess what ??? it wasn't ment to be...that's my point =)<br>
<br>
<br>
as you stated...*Allee's post might have been off subject and inappropriate* &lt;----- I don't see anything in her/his post that is appropriate!!<br>
<br>
please don't think i'm trying to get into a war with you..but i wanted to clear up the fact my first post was ment just the way you took it to be rude!!! just like i see Allee's post<br>
<br>
<br>
in other words for those that i have offended i will but it in nicer terms ....who do you think you are call someone else uneducated.<br>
<br>
how's that...if that seems more *appropraite* then i will delete or edit my first post<br>

I get just as upset with some posts but I do not tell them to F off I just think that maybe you could have defended Gus a little better than with a F off .  <br>
Also, to answer your question, I am not in Gus's guild,( we used to be in a great guild together but was dissolved and I consider Gus a GREAT friend and brother. which I would defend Gus with my life if needed, but my other point is that what was said by Allee was to Gus and you did not see me going off on her why? Cuz Gus can take care of himself. If Gus felt that &quot;that &quot; post needed a F off Gus would have said it. I get a little tired of people jumping on a thread to flame someone else that the thread wasnt even about them. I was simply pointing out to you that by responding with a F off to a response to someone else is NO better than the person who responded. That would be like me telling YOU that your a (insert bad name) for telling Allee to F off than where would we be? in some insidious flame war with each other and that would be missing Gus's whole intention of the subject of some Noob that had to pick up an item than hold it for ransom instead of doing the right thing and handing it back in. (could you not just ignore Allee's post and focus on the subject? and let Gus worry about what Allee said?) <br>
Furthermore Allee is not the first person that ever said something about paragraphs and spelling. To some people that is important.  To others it is not. But sheesh to tell them to F off is just a little extreme dont you think?<br>

I have been in similar situations..on both sides.<br>
<br>
When I first started, on the Rathe server, I was playing a gnome. In Steamfont, I came across a bag on the ground and picked it up. Finding that it was an Uber_shield, at least at that time it was I found out, I tuck it away in a bag cause I see noone around. Then a wolf comes up to me, I have only been playing for a couple weeks at this point, and asks if I found a shield..he had dropped it around here (while kiting). I ask him what it was and he describes it perfectly. So, I gave it back....he gave me over 50pp AND apologized for not having more! I was so dumbfounded and new that I took it and /bow, /kneel, /thank.... humming happily all the way to the bank. I would not have thought for a second to keep it, once he described it I knew it was his and returned it.<br>
<br>
On the flip side, shortly after this I returned to playing my first character, a Human Pally in FP. I log on and immediately recieve a tell from someone saying they have something for me. I run to them and they give me like 4 items. I had forgotten I needed to sell, and all 4 items dropped to ground. I picked up one, my benefactor picked up one...the other 2 got &quot;swooped&quot; and my shouting asking them to be returned did nothing.<br>
<br>
Sucks that this can happen and that peeps aren't always honest, but such is life, even in EQ.<br>
<br>
Glad you got your Rebreather back.<br>

I didn't think that I did anything wronge in this situation.  It just bugged the heck out of me, and I wanted to make sure.  I needed to rant about it.  <br>
Tinuvil and Simc you guys are both good friends.  I hate to see you argue.  I think what that Alley person put was inapropriate,  and rude.  Some people just get a superiority kick out of belittling people.  Even if its just for tiny insignificant things that only matter to them.  I don't get mad at people like that,  I feel sorry for them.<br>
Tinuvil Im insulted you keep calling me him.  lol<br>

Allow me to explain where that came from, and then please let it rest.  I am a teacher currently giving finals before the end of the school year.  I have become somewhat disheartened lately of the uncaring attitude that I see flooding the school where I teach.  It appears to me, that education has become very unimportant to many people.  It seems that the way in which a person communicates has also become less and less important with today's youth.  I refer to verbal communication as well as written.  (generalizing:  please don't go off on me and tell me it's not all youth.  I know this.)<br>
<br>
I guess I've become somewhat irritated at the quality of work I've seen from my students, and have let my work feeling leak into my personal life and viewing posts on public message boards.  <br>
<br>
In short, I just would like to see more pride taken in work sent out from anyone to the public eye.  I worry sometimes, that some of the students sitting in my classroom will very soon be the &quot;functioning&quot; adults we depend on from day to day.  I worry because of the effort I see.  This &quot;effort&quot; will not make it in the real world. <br>
<br>
I'm sorry for my comment.  It was inappropriate for the place that it was put.  (The teacher in me came out)  Damn..MISTAKE !! <br>
<br>
I just need those of you who have viewed these posts to understand my mindset when I wrote that.  (At my desk during lunch, catching up on some eq posts)  and just a bit frustrated.  <br>
<br>
I hope you understand and now, please let this drop.<br>
<br>
Hugs again,<br>
<br>
