<br>
Here's the letter (because if you thought the dang ezboard pop ups were annoying, you haven't seen the one that pops up every 30 seconds on eq.com now. Grrr, thats for 'nother rant). Annoyed and annoying Kel comments in bold.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
As we stated in our last Producer's letter back in March 2001, our priority is to focus strongly on communicating Customer Service policies to our customers and to better inform our player community about Customer Service in general. <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> IE. show you what customer service is NOT. </b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->At that time we posted our updated Naming Policy, and have recently posted our Account Security Statement. We would now like to take the next step and post our Reimbursement Policy to clarify any misconceptions players may have regarding it. <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> IE. We reimburse nothing...don't bother us, n00bs. </b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> We have also created a Reimbursement FAQ to answer any questions you may have. <br>
<br>
Please take the time to familiarize yourself with our existing Game Policies. And, in the near future we will be posting additional polices and FAQ's to better keep you informed. <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Happy joy</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Our continued goal is to make it perfectly clear not only what we expect from you as player-citizens of Norrath, but also what you can count on from us here at SOE/Verant. <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Apparently, more policies saying what the CS department will NOT bother doing.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
If you feel a GM is not adhering to any of our Customer Service policies, please feel free to email me directly at gscotto@station.sony.com, or Michelle Butler, EQ Customer Service Manager, at mbutler@station.sony.com.<br>
<br>
Thank you very much,<br>

Reimbursement Policy <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Also known as the Non-Reimbursment Policy TM</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
1. Bind Death Loops<br>
   1.1. Any losses due to bind death loop situations will not be reimbursed, including, but not limited to, corpses, items, and experience, regardless of the magnitude of the loss. <br>
      1.1.1 Note: Please remember to only be bound in safe places. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Oh, like that perfectly safe bind spot right next to the guards my little alt magician has...until some moron pulls the undead citizens, and the guards do NOTHING about them. I counted about five or six deaths in that loop. </b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
2. Characters Level 1-5<br>
   2.1. Characters of these levels will not receive reimbursement of any kind relating to items/coins or experience.<br>
      2.1.1 Note: We strongly advise against giving important items to characters below level 6.<br>
<br>
3. Coins<br>
   3.1. Coins (platinum, gold, silver, and copper) will not be reimbursed, regardless of the circumstance.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> We never learned to count</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>

<br>
5. Deleted/Missing Player Characters<br>
   5.1. Deleted/Missing characters may be restored, but those that were deleted may not be restored with their equipment.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> WHY?! This hits home, as several months Kel and one of my alts were deleted by a family member who was angry with me. Frizznik got me both characters back, intact, aside from a bit of rollback because of the backup files. It took him less than five minutes for the complete restore.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
   5.2. Deleted/Missing characters will not be restored with equipment that has been traded, dropped, destroyed, or otherwise legitimately lost.<br>
         5.2.1. Note: A restore of a deleted or missing character cannot be guaranteed, including any items of any kind that were on the character at the time of deletion. It is imperative you contact the server GM immediately if you wish to request a character restore.<br>
<br>
6. Destroyed Items<br>
   6.1. Items that are destroyed, intentionally or accidentally, will not be reimbursed.<br>
      6.1.1 Note: To avoid accidentally destroying an item, we suggest you turn off the fast item destroy option.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> We can't have our GM's bothering with that.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
7. Dropped Items<br>
   7.1. Items dropped, intentionally or accidentally, will not be reimbursed.<br>
   7.2. Items that fall to the ground during trades due to a full inventory, or due to those items not fitting into a container will not be reimbursed.<br>
   7.3. Any items that are thrown as a projectile, such as items placed in your range slot, intentionally or accidentally, will not be reimbursed.<br>
      7.3.1 Note: To avoid accidentally dropping an item, we suggest you set the item dropping option to never.<br>
<br>
8. Experience<br>
   8.1. Experience will not be restored for any death caused by latency (a.k.a. &quot;lag&quot;), Link-Death, or other forms of disconnection. <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> We all know EQ NEVER boots anyone itself...must be your isp dah-lings</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
   8.2. Experience will not be restored for any unverifiable bug. <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> We know all the bugs. New bugs could never occur</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
   8.3. Experience will not be restored for any death caused by duels, Player vs. Player combat, or NPC attacks.<br>
   8.4. Experience will not be restored for any loss due to a reset to a previous save. <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Mass server crashings NEVER cause rollbacks...its all in your head</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
9. Faction<br>
   9.1. Any reported abnormality of faction will not be altered by a GM.* <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> It's a feature</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
      9.1.1. *Note: There are currently no verifiable bugs that are related to faction. <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Again, we know all the bugs</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
10. NO RENT Items and Containers<br>
   10.1. Any item classified as NO RENT and all contents lost in NO RENT containers will not be reimbursed. This includes summoned items.<br>
<br>
11. NPC's/Corpses of NPC's<br>
   11.1. Any disappearing NPC's, items or corpses of an NPC, will not be respawned or reimbursed. <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Even though, aside from typical corpse decay, poofing NPC's are very well known bu--err, features.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
   11.2. Any NO DROP items looted from NPC's will not be transferred or reimbursed, regardless if the looting was intentional* or accidental.<br>
      11.2.1. *Note: Intentional Ninja-Looting will be dealt with as a separate issue. This only applies to situations of non-malicious looting.<br>
<br>
12. PC Corpse Decay<br>
   12.1. Any corpse lost to normal decay rate, including any items on that corpse, will not be reimbursed.<br>
<br>
13. Quests<br>
   13.1. Items lost in any Quest will not be reimbursed, regardless of the circumstance. <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Such as the Kromrif Military Leggings Quest. Its not buggy at all. You may turn in the harness and the broodmother gets stuck in a loop, or the item merely poofs, or the broodmother disappears, or becomes a dire wolf pet...these are features.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
   13.2. Items that are lost/reward given to wrong person due to Multi-Questing will not be transferred or reimbursed.<br>
   13.3. NPC's in Quests that disappear or are killed will not be respawned, nor will items on the NPC's be reimbursed. <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Poofing is a feature. We all suggest you go to our Harpy's Head Tavern and read about the mysterious &quot;poofing&quot; villains</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
   13.4. Items lost in any Quest performed incorrectly will not be reimbursed. <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Those two gnolls in Iceclad have almost identical names because we are evil</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
14. Trades<br>
   14.1. Items traded to or sold to other players, pets or other NPC's, intentionally or accidentally, will not be reimbursed. <br>
      14.1.1. Note: GM's will not assist with any trade disputes. All trades are considered final. <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Kick Lumi's butt on your own</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
15. Roll-backs<br>
   15.1. Any lost items, experience, or faction due to a reset to a previous save will not be reimbursed. <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Again, this is never our fault, see above</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Should any unforeseen technical issue occur resulting in the loss of items to our player base as a whole, Customer Service will address these issues separately across all servers. <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  We will tell you individually that we will not reimburse you.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
If your situation is not addressed in this policy, please use the /petition command for additional assistance. <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> So that we may add your situation to the list of non-reimbursements</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.Reimbursements of any kind, regardless of the circumstance, are not guaranteed. <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> In fact, from reading this policy, they are pretty much not happening.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Naming Policy <br>
Character Naming Policy <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Or, we've given up on calling this a roleplaying game but we will at least force you to have roleplaying names dang it!</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->(updated 2/28/01)<br>
<br>
Character names in EverQuest should reflect the genre of the game. Original, high-fantasy names are desired. These guidelines apply both to first names and to surnames, and also to the combination of first name and surname. <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> And the combination of first name and surname and pet name and mob name...ahhh fergit it!</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
The following types of names are unacceptable and are listed in order from the worst to the least offensive:<br>
<br>
Vile, profane, rude, or racist names including common swear words, anatomical references, racial slurs, and homonyms of these words. <br>
Combinations of words that produce an offensive result (e.g. Hugeaz, Tug Mcgroin). <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Makes sense</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Names of religious, occult, or significant historic origin (e.g. Jesus, Allah, Satan, Stalin). <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> No research into a meaning behind your name, throw some freaking letters together and call it good, mmkay?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Copyrighted or trademarked names of products, characters, services, or concepts (e.g. Drizzt, Marlboro, Sony). <br>
Non-fantasy oriented names from popular media. These names can be either fictional (e.g. Rambo, Darthvader) or non-fictional (e.g. Garth Brooks, Pierce Brosnan, Ronald Reagan, Michael Jordan). <br>
Common words and phrases that would not be found in the place and time setting of the game (e.g. Switchblade, Phaser, Toaster, Cannabis, Sloegin, Anyone). <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Anyone? Anyone?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Proper names from EverQuest (e.g. Rathe, Karana). This also includes the first or last name of any significant EverQuest NPC (e.g. Dorn, Trumpy, Karn). <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> We expect you to know and keep a list of all NPC first and last names next to your computer. There is no possible way your avatar is related to these NPC's</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
The names of senior Customer Support Representatives or employees of SOE or Sony Entertainment (e.g. Absor, Abashi, Aradune) <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Don't mess with us</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Names chosen with the intent or possessed with the effect of harming the reputation of a player or Customer Service Representative. <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> No Abashisockpuppet or Araduneneedsawoman</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Names containing titles within them, such as, but not limited to: The, Lord, Lady, Master, King, Knight, Sir, Father (e.g. Sirtallon, Lordeagle, Mothermaggy, Darksister). <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> You aren't special enough</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Names that contain sentences (Ikillorcs), phrases (Ontop), or two or more words that do not form descriptive compound words (Petcarbob, Diediedie and Tablechair). Descriptive compound words are allowed in first names and are encouraged in surnames (e.g. Treehugger, Giantslayer). Descriptive compound words (each separate part of the word and the entire word) must otherwise adhere to all other naming rules. <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> We have no sense of humor. Originality sucks. Please change your clever name to Aeodoeithinalar promptly</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Fantasy-oriented names that are easily recognized from popular existing media (e.g. Merlin, Gandalf, Belgarath, Tanis). <br>
Names where the combination of the first and last name form a phrase or violate a previous rule (e.g. Crymea River, Bran Muffin, Story Thyme) <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> I said we had no sense of humor</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
For all of the above, misspellings and alternative spellings of the word or words are also unacceptable.<br>
<br>
If a name is found to be in violation of any of the above polices, a member of the Server Management Team will then use the following process:<br>
<br>
For category 1 or 2 offenses, a GM will delete the character as soon as it is discovered. You will not be notified of this deletion. The items and experience levels on the character will not be restored or reimbursed under any circumstances. Depending on the nature of the offensive name, the account may also be subject to disciplinary action including suspension or banning. A GM will not contact you before disciplinary action is taken. <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Can't you just change the doink's NAME?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
For categories 3 through 13, the GM will contact you either in game or via email to notify you of the character's name change. Please be aware that if you do not choose a name that is in accordance with this naming policy at the time of creation a new name will be assigned to your character and this name will not be changed. After your name is changed, those corpses will not be lootable, and no reimbursements will be given. <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> See our reimbursement policy so you know you share the company of the rest of the Eq population in this.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Conditions for Name Changes:<br>
<br>
First names will not be changed unless they violate the Naming Policy. Players often petition to have their name or surname changed, or to ask for a surname that the /surname command will not allow. <br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Surname Policy:<br>
<br>
Surnames may not contain spaces <br>
Surnames may contain double capitals provided one of the divisions of the name is not a word, it does not create a title or a sentence, or breaks up a real word. <br>
Surnames may contain an accent ( ` ) provided one of the divisions of the name is not a word, it does not create a title or a sentence, or breaks up a real word. This accent is the only non-alpha character that is allowed in surnames. <br>
Any number of players may have the same surname. Players wishing to use a surname that's rejected by the name filter as already in use do not need to seek out the original user of that surname to obtain permission. <br>
Surnames are protected by a Grandfather Clause: If a surname currently exists with spaces, double capitals, or accents, but does not violate the naming policy rules, they will remain unchanged. This is the only case in which a name will be grand fathered.<br>
<br>
Note: Non-words like-- D, Da, De, Di, El, Z, Za, Ze, Zi, L, Le, La, Li are unacceptable in cases where the name contains a normal word, as they are references to &quot;The&quot; and implicate a title, in both cases (e.g. D`Kval is acceptable and D`Basher is not). <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Get in line! Follow the crowd!</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Conditions for Surname Changes:<br>
<br>
The player is level 20+ and…<br>
<br>
Either the surname, or the combination of the first name and surname violate the Naming Policy. <br>
Is getting married or divorced. <br>
Is entering or leaving a guild or family that shares a common surname. <br>
Doesn't have a surname yet, or wishes their current surname to contain double capitals (e.g. McGregor, GaFennix, XacLevir). <br>
Doesn't have a surname yet, or wishes their current surname to contain an accent ( ` ) (e.g. Ka`Trevx, Doli`k, Jan`frik). <br>
Doesn't have a surname yet and the surname they are trying to give themselves is not being granted even though it does not violate the Naming Policy. <br>
Surnames will not be modified for any other reason. <br>
 <br>
<br>
Account Security <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> or, Screw you, we don't care</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
<br>
As the population of Norrath increases, so too do issues regarding stolen or compromised accounts, and/or accounts that have been transferred from one player to another in violation of the User Agreement. These issues - and the time it takes to investigate and attempt to resolve them - hugely detract from the time that SOE's customer service staff have to devote to providing quality customer service to issues that impact upon the gameplay experience. <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Such as writing more policies</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->. Accordingly, SOE must remind all players that:<br>
<br>
(1) Account security -- whether it be password protection, running virus checks, disabling file sharing, or any other element of making sure accounts are not stolen or compromised -- is the sole responsibility of the account owner. <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> We don't even have to do our own virus scans, so nyeh!</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
(2)Any and all stolen and/or compromised accounts that are reported to SOE will be banned, and no items will be reimbursed. Any player found to be involved in an account theft will have any and all of his/her accounts banned. <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Don't bother us, we are busy writing more policies</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Prior to banning any accounts reported as compromised, we will conduct a thorough review of the accounts in question and determine the appropriate course of action on those accounts. <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Which as we've stated, is banning</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->. Accounts will only be banned based on information gathered through our investigation and not merely as a result of external allegations. <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> We thought we heard you say so, buh bye</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
- The EverQuest Customer Service Team <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Luv you! Hugs! Mean it!</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>

WTH? VS faction rollback isnt a bug? I have heard of people who lost their VELIOUS faction due to bugs (fun to have ally to dragons one day, and then zone in and see threatening the next.  But whoops, no bugs there, nonono.)<br>
<br>
And WTF is wrong with naming policy? So I cant capitalize C in NovaCat because 'Surnames may contain double capitals provided one of the divisions of the name is not a word'? Erm this plain sux!<br>

So what would you have them do? make ambiguous exceptions? how is the caster that binds at the WK ogre site and gets in a loop any different?  how about someone who binds in fear?  the reason for this policy is to make a statement... you are responsible for the safety of your bind point.  the safety of the freeport gates is OK, but not as good as at the freeport bank, for example, and its your choice.<br>

Frizznik got me both characters back, intact, aside from a bit of rollback because of the backup files.

again, you're asking for inconsistency.  if its not a documented verant server crash/lag/router... then how can they tell who 'pulled the plug', who 'got disconnected' and who '/q'ed'?  this policy (going LD when the majority of the server and zone stays online) ensures that there is little to no inconsistency in when EXP is restored.<br>

<br>
honestly, kel, i understand your frustration but they can't just leave it up to a GMs mood.  they have to have policies, and policies they can point to.  <br>
<br>
it sounds like you'd be quite happy to have an EQ where anyone who dies can say they lag-deathed to get their experience back (who needs clerics?!), get any weapon they want by waiting for a server crash, be fully reimbursed for their own mistakes (bind loop, trades), walking around with the name &quot;Whydontyou Kickatire&quot;, as they merrily waste the GMs time because they clicked YES I WANT TO DESTROY MY CLOAK OF FLAMES.  /shrug<br>
<br>
that being said, verant CS does indeed need a lot of work. their account security post is scary and i hope is just a scare tactic to stop account sharing.  their log system isn't the greatest and doesn't always prove what it should.  <br>

I don't think Kelyna's post was meant to express outrage at Verant past, present, and future.  In fact as she stated she has had good experiences in which Frizznik and other GM's that helped her.  I think her concern is just that some of the new statements in this CS policy statement may in fact make it more difficult for the GM's to use their own judgement and common sense when deciding whether someone really does have a valid problem.<br>
<br>
*shrugs*  Besides, its fun ripping up &quot;policy statements&quot; that are in essense put in place by / to deal with people who don't have common sense.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Making it sound like any GM who does otherwise on his/her own judgement risks his/her job.<br>
<br>
Let me think of a few recent examples of verant's bad CS, just from my own experience.<br>
<br>
Tistalion has his velious faction reset after he's warmly to both dragons and dorfs.  He has to start completely over.  And, of course, there's no bug here.<br>
<br>
My brother (Lalador) dies in sol b and just logs off.  He logs on 2-3 days later...and his corpse is gone.  He petitions, waits several hours, no response, so he logs.  He petitions many more times over the next several weeks and either is told he needs to wait for Frizz or has to log before he ever gets a response.  Finally I start petitioning for him every day, finally get in touch with frizzy, and am assured that &quot;the corpse decayed normally after 7 days.&quot;  BS!  That's why it said &quot;you have no corpses in this zone&quot; after 3 days right?  Well, Lalador was not reimbursed a single item.<br>
<br>
Draxs, Xanthor, Celina, and who was that leezard shammy?  Draxs completed the entire *absurdly difficult* wizzy epic, and turned in his items, to get...nothing.  Why?  He didn't have a main inventory slot open.  Wtf?  It's a staff, not a bag!  I probably would've quit over something that heartbreaking.  When I did my epic, I did *not* have a main inventory slot open, so I would not have an epic today either if this were to happen with the enchanter epic too.<br>
<br>
Xanthor killed ragefire for the last piece of his epic.  The final blow was done by someone who was LD, and the corpse poofed.  He had to do a large portion of his epic over.<br>
<br>
Celina accidentally gave her pearl to a pet *cringe* to spawn ragefire, and had to do parts of her epic over.<br>
<br>
The leezard shammy (sorry don't remember name, but it was posted all over the boards) had to do most of his epic over because of a faction bug.<br>
<br>
There are so many more, lots posted on these boards.  Verant's CS policy is basically &quot;if there's a bug, it's your fault,&quot; or &quot;better hope you're not the victim of a bug, cause if you are it sucks to be you!&quot;<br>
<br>
It's getting harder and harder for me to justify to myself supporting a company with such absolutely horrendous CS.  It's only a matter of time until I am a victim of some devastating bug or another and am told to go f*** myself by verant... <p><img src="http://www.annastazia.homestead.com/files/adjani.jpg" alt="Adjani Tristesse, Goddess of Lanys"></img>

<br>
it really doesn't matter though... those who dislike the CS will most likely always do so, and those that like it will be the same.<br>

frizzie does an awful lot for people, and verants policy does not say 'no' unless you do something against policy.  which would be dumb.  trading to an npc is unfortunate, but dumb.  getting scammed by a player is unfortunate, but dumb.  hitting destroy on an item you want is unforutnate, but dumb.  and those are the things they are saying 'no' to... to pretty much everything else they are saying 'please petition immediately and we'll investigate'.<br>

Tell me, how does one make fun of people who have no common sense who make policies or those without common sense who need the policies asside from cutting their statements to shreads using sarcasm?  Sarcasm aimed at a person's actions IMO is the _most_ effective means available of making fun of them.  Yeah, it royally upsets some people because it cuts more deeply and more directly at a person than the standard &quot;F u, u r stoopid!&quot;  But this is also part of its power.<br>

<br>
How many times did they have to elevate a petition, only to find out later that the petition was pretty much smacked down because of some stupid arse rule? Stuff that, when I heard it first, sounded like a serious problem. VI is constantly telling the guides some stupid bullshit, lying through their teeth, or just making up fairytales and passing them of as nonfiction. That, or we're told to pretty much shut up and fall in line.<br>
<br>
I'm sick of it. If half of you had any idea how much BS we listen to, and how much we're told we CAN'T help you, you'd quit the game right fuckin' now. Because, to be honest, yes there is CS. Yes, it's dedicated people who are willing to spend their free time to help you. No, they aren't allowed to help you beyond a certain point. No, they aren't allowed to bend rules even a little bit. No, they aren't allowed to help you with any SERIOUS problems beyond sending it furthur up the chain where it, of course, is going to get smacked down.<br>
<br>
See a pattern here? The guides are good, helpful people that want to be there for you. It's anyone that's getting paid that doesn't really give a rat's ass about ya.<br>
<br>
That's just an opinion, mind you....I'm certain there are GM's out there who DO care. I just haven't seen one yet.<br>

It is the people at the top, the one's who make rules that, frankly, are sometimes extremely stupid and limiting. <br>
<br>
That incident with the Broodmother I mentioned <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> did</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> happen. For the record, this is a notoriously buggy quest, and I did a lot of reading up about it before I attempted. I had a group to kill Fergul, saw on track that she was up, ran invis through the caves to reach her, turned in the harness, and recieved the quest message. She started moving, and I informed the zone that I was triggering the Broodmother and to stay clear of the giant fort for their own safety. Everything went fine until the Broodmother reached the gates...and promptly turned to the side and walked off. The two named giants did not spawn, she did not attack, nothing. <br>
<br>
I followed her around as she made two more loops from the wurm caves to the giant fort and back again, but nothing happened. Finally, I petitioned and my group and I went off to kill giants nearby while we waited. About twenty to thirty minutes later, I got a reply from Frizznik. Now, this whole time, the Broodmother had been looping back and forth. I explained to Frizz what had happened, he asked me what the quest message was that she gave me, I told him, and he said he would check it out.<br>
<br>
 Frizz then runs up to the Broodmother and hands in a harness of his own. He gets the quest message, and she again turns toward the giant fort, only to get stuck in the loop once more. He does it AGAIN, and this time the Broodmother despawns. Just poofs.<br>
<br>
I was informed that he was not allowed to respawn her, and Frizz regretfully handed me the no drop harness again, which was all the rules let him do. I was a bit disappointed, but grateful at least that I would not have to do the entire quest over, especially because the initial piece was a gift from a friend.<br>
<br>
With that incident in mind, look at this:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> 13.1. Items lost in any Quest will not be reimbursed, regardless of the circumstance. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> 13.3. NPC's in Quests that disappear or are killed will not be respawned, nor will items on the NPC's be reimbursed. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Now, according to this new policy, if this happened tommorrow instead of a month or so ago, there is <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> nothing</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> that Frizznik could do. His hands are tied, his bosses have decreed that we will have to deal with their buggy quests on our own. To do otherwise risks his job and position.<br>
<br>
I am assuming that this quest has been in game since the release of Velious. My experience with it was not a rare fluke, as I have found clear on every reference to it I can find where player comments are allowed. To add to that, fast forward until about two weeks ago. I completed the quest (though didn't manage to kill that darn giant before he poofed, my group was not strong enough <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ) and afterwards the Broodmother was wandering around as a dire wolf's <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> pet</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->. Broodmother is, to my knowledge, between the levels of 55 to 60...I'd hate to agro that wolf  *wince*. Now, would anyone who died because of this recieve reimbursement? I hope so, but from reading that policy I cannot be sure.<br>
<br>
I'm afraid I cannot see where the majority of the policy is stating to petition a GM, Xian. Maybe we're interpreting differently, but to me, it just looks like Verant is giving the player base a big &quot;don't even bother&quot;.<br>
