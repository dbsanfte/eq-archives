<br>
&quot;Outside of the Holocaust of WWII and the Spanish Inquisitions there have been no siginificant persecutions of Jews. &quot;<br>
<br>
What other persecutions you guys want to know?  Lets try the pogroms in Russia.  Oh, how about modern day France as well.  Also, I believe that Romans forced Jews to convert to their Pagan religions at the time, so there is a pre-Christian example.<br>
<br>
&quot;I would like to know more about Jewish minorities in the Arab countries. &quot;<br>
<br>
what Jewish minorities in arab countries?  When it is so easy for a Jew to get into Israel, why would they live in a hell hole like the other middle east countries?  I know some of the most prosperous Jewish Iraqui families that fled to America because of persecution.<br>
<br>
&quot;Muslims have, through out the centuries have given options to those who they conquer. You can be killed, convert to Islam, or publicly submit to Muslims to earn a writ of protection. &quot;<br>
<br>
Well isn't that sweet of them.  I believe the topic of this post is Israeli politics = hypocratics?...lets talk about hypocrasy.  You are saying that Muslims are better than Jews because they give Jews 3 lovely options.  Death, conversion, or becoming a second class citizen.  Now as you claim, Jews are treating these Palestinians so poorly, yet as you have stated Muslims do the same.  Lovely work here.<br>
<br>
&quot;I have learned so much on this board. Its great to discuss such an array of issues with so many people. There is going to be an Pro-Israeli rally monday at our school and was thinking of attending for a bit to see what kind of things they are saying. I think I have learned enough to hold a pretty good argument. I will make sure to quote you. LOL they will probably be like, &quot;What the hell kind of name is Lurikeen?&quot;(Lurking in the depths of genius)&quot;<br>
<br>
Should be interesting.  Prepare to get your ass handed to you.  Could you possibly video tape it for me?<br>
<br>
&quot;If persecution there was so bad, then please explain the mass exodus of Jews from Europe and Asia to Palestine?&quot;<br>
<br>
Firstly, with the persecution in mind it's the lesser of two evils.  You have Jews from Russia who have just suffered through centuris of pogroms, and you have Jews of Europe who have just suffered through the hollocaust.  Wouldn't you like to get away?  Secondly, returning to the Jewish homeland is a common Jewish idea.  When these people had the opportunity to return, they did.<br>
<br>
<br>
This is not an attack on Palestinians as you have made an attack on Jews, I am merely trying to clear up some gross misconceptions while attempting to be as unbiased as possible.  If you want more examples I suggest you read up, or I would be delighted to provide you with some.<br>

     Well, I thought about Israeli Politics and felt it seemed rather hypocritical so I put the two together.<br>
<br>
     Quote Antheus:  Brutas, I think if you want a bit of history you should ask a historian rather than someone who lets biases get in the way of facts.<br>
<br>
     I like getting both point-of-views.  Especially when someone has a passion for what they are saying.  <br>
<br>
Quote Antheus:  What other persecutions you guys want to know?<br>
<br>
Yes, the Jewish people have been persecuted quite a bit.  Amazing that everyone in the world is bad except for Jewish people.  Poor Jewish people.<br>
<br>
Quote ‘ ‘:  what Jewish minorities in arab countries?<br>
<br>
The Jewish people have lived in many of the Arab countries for thousands of years.  Until recently of course.<br>
<br>
Quote ‘’:  Well isn't that sweet of them.<br>
<br>
His point was that the Jewish people were given the Same options the Christians and everyone elses were given.  Not that it was a just option but that it was a constant.<br>
<br>
Quote ‘’:  Prepare to get your ass handed to you.<br>
<br>
<br>
Well Antheus, you aren’t sounding very convincing.  You obviously don’t agree with what Lurikeen is saying but I don’t see you arguing with any substance.<br>
<br>
Quote ‘’:  I am merely trying to clear up some gross misconceptions while attempting to be as unbiased as possible.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   MAN you sure cleared up some misconceptions on this board.  I thought you might have had something to say but it turns out that you had nothing to offer to the particular forum for debate.  “unbiased as possible.”   ß-------Combine some that passion with something to say and get back to me.  I mean, I liked the big ‘Pogrom’ word and all but Geesh.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rolleyes --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/eyes.gif ALT=":rolleyes"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
     As far as being unbiased, I care for Palestinians and Israelis equally.  (not that I have some special place in my heart for either of them)  I’m not trying to find out who the ‘bad guy’ is but merely trying to understand what the essence of the conflict is.  I find it hard to believe the Israelis are innocent of all wrongdoing while the Palestinians are just ‘bad’ people.  This is why it is important to hear both sides of the story.  Everyone has something useful to say.  People are not blowing themselves up so they can have 72 unpopped cherries in Heaven waiting for them.  The media is playing on ignorance.  This just so happens to be something I choose not to ignore.   <br>

<br>
As if a historian doesn't have a particular bent, or view of the world? I wonder what you could possibly mean.<br>
<br>
<i>"What other persecutions you guys want to know? Lets try the pogroms in Russia."</i><br>
<br>
Yes, the "Pogroms" were indirectly decreed by Czar Nicholas 1 (Pale of Settlement) and officially ended in 1917 when the Bolsheviks took Moscow (most likely ended in the 1920s). They are attributed to the assassination Alexander II, if I recall correctly. It was believed Jews assasinated him.<br>
<br>
You should note that Muslims were also affected and still are to this day. (Can you say Chechnya and Uzbekistan?) I am always amazed that everbody goes running up the Star of David with talk of perseuctions and other religions get left out. Hundreds of Muslims have died in the Old Soviet Empire to this day. Why won't you talk about that Antheus?<br>
<br>
My point remains the same. Even including the Pogroms in Russia we still do not find some over arching world conspiracy to eliminate Jews.<br>
<br>
<i>"You are saying that Muslims are better than Jews because they give Jews 3 lovely options."</i><br>
<br>
Nope didn't say that. I was merely pointing out historical fact. The fact remains that Muslims did devise a plan for tolerance. They are not the demons many want to make them out to be.<br>
<br>
<i>"Should be interesting. Prepare to get your ass handed to you."</i><br>
<br>
ROFLMAO! What a ridiculous statment. By all means give it your best shot Corkie.<br>
<br>
<i>"Firstly, with the persecution in mind it's the lesser of two evils.

Secondly, returning to the Jewish homeland is a common Jewish idea. When these people had the opportunity to return, they did."</i><br>
<br>
First, the "Pogroms" refer to the period 1871-1906 in Russia. Hardly the "centuries" you want to claim. Furthermore, I am not denying that there have been Jewish persecutions. I am saying that generally, Jews have not been persecuted to any greater extent than any other religious group throughout history with the exception of the Holocaust (Don't forget that other races, mostly of color, were rounded up and butchered, too). Now if you want to enjoy a tear session over Jewish persecutions then please don't forget to spare a few tears for the Muslims while you are at it.<br>
<br>
Second, the so-called "Jewish Homeland" you refer to is also the homeland of Palestinians whose families lived their for centuries only to have Zionists take their properties shortly after 1948. Furthermore, if the persecutions of Jews in Palestine was so terrible shortly prior to 1948 then why did we see such a large jump in immigration? Your premise of the "lesser of two evils" is absurd. Are we supposed to believe that those who are persecuted would go to another land knowing full well they will be persecuted?! <br>
<br>
<i>"This is not an attack on Palestinians as you have made an attack on Jews, I am merely trying to clear up some gross misconceptions while attempting to be as unbiased as possible."</i><br>
<br>
LOL. I am attacking Jews now? What a laugh. But I should expect as much from someone like you who wants to see history from one side.<br>
<br>
Good luck in trying to clear up misconceptions. You haven't as yet.<br>
