<br>
To understand better this rant, i'm going to need to fill you in better on the situation i'm living in now.<br>
<br>
For the first four months of our relationship, sex was good.  I could get it 3 times a day NP... but then things started slowing down... I'm now at the point that I haven't had sex w/ my fiancee in 2 months (this is after a year of being together). <br>
<br>
I've tried several things to entice him.  I've met him at the door naked (he asks why i'm naked and sits down in front of the TV).  I've tried  the usual, kissing him where i know he likes to be kissed and such (he just shoo's me away).  I've even tried to entic him in the morn, when he's ALREADY got a hardon (he says he has to pee, runs to the bathroom and then makes a beeline for anywhere but the bedroom, where i'm waiting).  I've tried waking him up w/ sex...... you know kissing down his chest and stomach, you can see where i'm heading? (he covers his dick w/ his hand, WHILE STILL SLEEPING)  tried this method several times.. to no avail.<br>
<br>
At first i thought sex was maybe ... too much of a chore for him?  too much work?  so i tried this one day:  while he was at the computer i came up behind him and kissed him on the nape of the neck, in that tender spot ... that i know he likes... i kissed his neck all the way around as i turned his chair around and sat on his lap, straddling him... (keep in mind i'm wearing nothing but a t-shirt)  i tilt my hips a bit so i can feel him pressed against my pussy.... kiss his lips a few times... and he says &quot;what are you doing?&quot; (like DUHHH) i say &quot;kissing you&quot;  and he says &quot;ok&quot;  he kissed me a few times then pats me on the ass and sets me out of his lap, as he turns around to his computer (before you guys think, well of course.. you just don't interrupt his game like that.... he was emptying the crap from his hotmail acct.)<br>
My idea was... heck if i have to do all the work... by being on top (which is one of my better liked positions anyways) then lets do it...  no go w/ him though.<br>
<br>
So, sex isn't a chore for him... maybe it's boring?   Next time he gets around to wanting sex (after SEVERAL HINTS from me {and me practically having to rape him} he says &quot;ok i'll fuck you&quot;... *sigh*  how romantic) i tell him i want to try some different things... he wouldn't even try the blind fold... he says he's not into anal sex.... he DID try a couple different positions... but we still ended up doing it missionary style... bam, we both orgasm.... i don't get sex for another month. =/<br>
<br>
ok so... it's not a chore or boring... maybe =( he doesn't find me physically attractive anymore.  i ask him... he laughs uproarously and says &quot;where would you come up w/ that idea?!&quot;  (to give you guys an idea, i'm 5'10  big busted, small ass and LONG legs... considered by most &quot;pretty&quot;)  &quot;what gives me that idea?  well, THE FACT WE HAVEN'T HAD SEX IN A MONTH??!!&quot;  &quot;i just haven't been in the mood&quot;  *sigh*<br>
<br>
so... what am i left w/?  not me and it's not the sex we have... maybe he's getting it elsewhere?  I've asked him and of course he denies it... who wouldn't.  Personally i tend to believe him... his time has always been accounted for and i've never had need to be suspicious of this type of thing.  He's not the type and he hasn't exihibited any signs or symptoms of such a thing.  No secrecy, i always know where he is (he calls and tells me)  and i most of the time can feel free to call him (on a land line, not cell) to speak w/ him.<br>
<br>
i'm just at a loss.... am i going to have to live w/ &quot;i just haven't been in the mood????&quot; <br>
<br>
oh, i think i forgot to mention that i'm the type of person who could have sex 8 times a day and barely be satisfied.<br>
<br>
I'm sorry but i just needed to write this down and rant... and cuz i like ppl to read what i write... i'm posting it.<br>
BUT for my own sanity (because A LOT of ppl know me), i'm sorry but i'm going to have to post anon.<br>
<br>
sigh, did i miss something to try? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uanalornesongheart.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Analorne Songheart</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 92<br> <font color=#E9D756>(10/17/01 12:32:22 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://members.home.net/hsheetz/analorne.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: men who don't like sex</span><hr size=1> Couples sometimes go through this.  It's not really something that you can pinpoint.  In order to correct it, you both have to be willing to admit that there is something that needs fixing.  Maybe he's just not there yet.  <br>
<br>
Try talking to him.  Most of all, though...try not to make it a huge issue...sometimes that makes it worse.  I spent the better part of a year &quot;not in the mood&quot;...Just my husband trying to kiss me pissed me off.<br>
<br>
Yes, I found him attractive.  Yes, I loved him.  I just didn't wanna go there and the more pressure there was, the more I avoided it.<br>

I am not telling you to do it, I am telling you to make him jealous. Jealous is one of the strongest feeling a human can feel. And it can awake some other feelings in him.<br>
<br>
But, beware, jealousy is realy a strong feeling and can lead to some tense situation. but if you are so desesparate to write this on a gaming board, then maybe you should try it. <p><center><b>Nosfy Vifargent - The Lil'yoddling Paladin<BR>Officer of The Phoenix Crusaders - Guild of Erollisi

<br>
Some men do not like to be manipulated. I have seen what you describe in<br>
some newlyweds. The wife would bitch and then I would ask my freind who I had know for years, and the upshot was that:<br>
<br>
The thrill of conquest was absent if there were no conquest.<br>
The female in question had started to remind him of his mother(this is VERY bad)<br>
She had several 'reservations' about certain things that limited his inventiveness.<br>
<br>
BUT the #1 biggest reason is they dont like being manipulated. So dont do that.<br>
Even the most satyric man will rebell against being manipulated.<br>
<br>
In young men (ie pre 30) you must remember that they enjoy the chase and conquest. They dont enjoy a 'fun' activity turning into 'work'<br>
<br>
Eventually some of the women had affairs which really shook up the males.<br>
But one of the women commited suicide over it.(having the affair)<br>
I think that is a bit extreme. A nice girl placed in a terrible situation.<br>
<br>
This all assumes that you are not actually a troll and that your serious. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ugurglespitfruggybasher.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gurglespit Fruggybasher</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://dyce.i8.com/gurblip.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 1179<br> <font color=#E9D756>(10/17/01 1:28:40 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: men who don't like sex</span><hr size=1> maybe it just isn't the right person.. if you can have sex 8 times a day and barely be satisfied and he likes to have sex once a month, then you probably weren't meant to be toghether.

<br>
I do however feel the munipulation thing is a bad idea... and to make him jealous is even worse... you want to "fix" a problem... not make it worse Im assuming.<br>
<br>
I have yet to find a guy who's even remotely close to the satisfaction of a warm bubble bath and an entertainment weekly magazine... so I find it pointless to even try.  <br>
<br>
Also, there are several books, sites, and such that can offer some pointers on making or saving a sex life in a relationship... one of the ones I know of offhand that is very popular is funinbed.com <br>
<br>
Personally Im not a pro on the issue but I hear this story a lot... in my line of business its my job to market and promote items/books that will help couples out with this problem.  So I suggest checking some sites online for books/information pertaining to this common problem.  The internet is information at your fingertips... its hard to find decent sites though without stumbling upon your typical pr0n crap but it may be worth the half hour of searching to find something that might suit your needs.<br>

I do feel for you though I'm sorry to hear of your delema but alas I cannot offer any suggestions. This a problem only you and him can resolve. Try getting more involved in his life like meeting his friends, meet him for lunch, different things. This way you can find out what is happening. Maybe work is giving him a lot of problems and he is stressed all the time and just doesn't want to deal with the world.<br>

<br>
All this &quot;make him jealous&quot; or &quot;act disinterested&quot; is juvenile and dishonest.<br>
<br>
If you love him and want to make it work, talk to him.  Maybe his job is stressing him out.  Maybe he's taking medication that interferes with his sex drive.  Suggest counseling.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/bemarr.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=patric>patric</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 901<br> <font color=#E9D756>(10/17/01 6:42:10 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: men who don't like sex</span><hr size=1> I agree with Glori. I dont think married couples should treat each other like that. Im always seeing my brother's girlfriend treat him like shit when she doesnt get her way (try to make him jealous) but he's not man enough to stand up to her though, so i guess its another story all together <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/unirecnadthetrademaster.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Nirecnad the Trademaster</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 1687<br> <font color=#E9D756>(10/17/01 7:22:30 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://members.theglobe.com/brethrena/hehe.jpg http://members.theglobe.com/brethrena/hehe.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: men who don't like sex</span><hr size=1> I suggest you consult Erollisi Marr's own Ladies Man.

wanted to talk sex on a public board....I would also say that<br>
if you aren't married yet you should reconsider.  How people's<br>
sex drives match matters alot in a long term married <br>
relationship.  If you are the type that wants it 4 to 7 times a <br>
week and for him once every few weeks is ok you are not well<br>
suited to each other.  I would say this is at least as important<br>
as as my friend once put...<br>
<br>
&quot;There are places in my life you just don't fit....I have needs you just can't fill&quot;<br>
<br>
I would say find a hobby go out leave him alone kick him off <br>
the computer and come play EQ.  Give it a while. <br>
<br>
If you are already married I think that counceling is in order. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uluviahoodyhooo.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Luvia Hoodyhooo</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 48<br> <font color=#E9D756>(10/17/01 7:38:51 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: men who don't like sex</span><hr size=1> I'd say the post above that said you should get all done up (not slutty, but still attractively) and hang out with your girlfriends at clubs and such is your best bet.  He's taking you for granted, and he's going to continue to do so unless he feels like he might loose you.  Yes, it's along the jealousy line, but it's unfortunate that sometimes things like this are the only way you can get a person to react.<br>
<br>
Of course, you could always just dump him and find someone more your speed.   It would be alot easier now than it would be if/when you're married.<br>
