<br>
On top of all the evidence here, Karaevek is known within the Riders as a pretty decent guy, he has been with us a long time, ever since our merger with the old Clan of Wisdom a long long time ago.  I was awestruck when I saw his name up here and I still am.  Personally I'd like to see the logs up here, and see if there was any harrassment from the OTHER side.  Calling him a foreigner like that does seem a bit rude, especially right after telling him to leave for no reason. I'm not sure how much more evidence we need but I say go for it Holygaurd, have Fritzle post the log and SC.   <p><center>

<br>
After we asked Fritzle to leave (we had enough problems as it was), he started acting like an ass. I asked if English was his second language after he said &quot;Huh?&quot; for the third or fourth time. I wonder if he showed you screenshots of him calling Evryl a queer and emoting that he was kicking her in the head?<br>
<br>
I'd also like to know where you got the information that you can see invis people on track? I can assure you this is entirely incorrect. I am a ranger. I know damned well you can't, unless you happen to be grouped with that person.<br>
<br>
Finally, your theoretical &quot;what if Hadden had popped&quot; doesn't apply: Vamyanu knew precisely when he was supposed to pop, since she had been at the camp since he had last been killed.<br>
<br>
Please, have Fritzle post a log. I'd most certainly enjoy seeing him prove QUITE a few things for me. (That he was spamming us with emotes, calling names, and that we engaged the spawn first.)<br>
<br>
I was willing to let this lie, but since you all seem so bound and determined to drag it on, please, by all means, do so. <p><center>

Being a ass, logging on multiple characters to harrass and insult people along with spamming the zone with your insults is scummy. But attitude isn't SListable. I posted here because Tyral posted and I was involved so I stated my side of things. <br>
<br>
But ya'll seem to be missing the main point of this. The above since it was only once and while a sign indicative of someone that I would not want to group with, isn't SListable. But waiting till a mob is down to less then 75% health but more then 50%. Then nuking it to death to prevent someone from getting the kill. That is SListable and the main reason this is here at least in my view.<br>
<br>
KSing is against the rules. Not our Lanys social rules that everyone seems to follow. It's against the games rules itself.<br>
<br>
See when someone hits something first it belongs to them.<br>

But when someone nukes it out from under you that is called KILLSTEALING<br>

<br>
I had to scroll up to take these screenshots since at the time I was fighting it was a bit hard to do anything else. I was also hoping that once he saw that we had engaged it first he would have the DECENCY to just note what time we killed Hadden and come back and camp it himself. But instead he decided to violate the rules.<br>
<br>
Oh. And BTW. Track does NOT show people who are invisible unless you have See Invisible up. It may have at one time but that is not the case currently. I could not see Karaevek when he used Gather Shadows on my track.<br>

<br>
You guys have no proof whatsoever that he logged on multiple characters.  This is pretty much beside the point though.<br>
<br>
I agree attitude isn't shitlistable either.  Either way you cut it, it's rather like the example (Joe Dr00d didn't port me)  only this post wasn't deleted &quot;right away&quot;.  <br>
<br>
You said you were willing to let this post just lie here, it doesn't matter.  Whether it's on the first page or the last page, the post is still here, and Karaevek has to deal with that reputation of being on the shit list whether he is being honorable or not.<br>
<br>
Did he say &quot;huh?&quot; 4 times AFTER you guys told him to leave for no apparent reason?<br>
<br>
I'm not sure if typing /rude or standing in front of another character and merely bending down is shitlistable, but if it is you might as well put half the Lanys community up here as well. <p><center>
