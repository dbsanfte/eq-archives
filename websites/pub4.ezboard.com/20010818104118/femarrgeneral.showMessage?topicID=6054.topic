I only enjoy it when playing really low level characters. However, having spent nearly two years playing it, and being too skint to do something more worthwhile with my life, like erm.... Hmm, going to the pub ...or erm something, I don't want to ditch it without trying. <br>
<br>
Did anyone else reach this point around 49 and then get into their 50s and love it? I just have a feeling I'm not going to love it at all, and infact feel no compunction to log on and get two orange bubs. My partner got 51, and I watched with horror as his xp bar ground to an almighty halt.  <br>
<br>
I think perhaps if I find new places to hunt I'll enjoy it again. I've tried Skyfire, but it was a bit tough. Seemed like I left the giants in Burning Woods too late, although that place is bloody depressing. Some of the mobs there looked okay, but it was so busy, and Gullerback seemed permanently on the prowl. Basically I need somewhere that a combination of druid(49)/necro(45) and wiz(51)/warrior(48 )  can do by themselves, with the possibility of dragging a group along aswell. Mostly use the wizard and druid combo. Are there any decent places I should try out? <br>
<br>
Any suggestions would be welcome, other than ones that involve Guk or insects in SolB.<br>
<br>
Hopefully, <br>

The only thing that kept me playing was the tight group of chums I'd been playing with for so long.  But post 50, there were fewer and fewer places where we could move in, kill stuff, have fun, then leave.<br>
<br>
Things that got in the way when it came to having fun:  overcrowding, higher level zones geared toward raids rather than single groups, absolutely moronic game mechanics (like taking 30 minutes to get everyone to Howling Stones, zoning in to find everything that's do-able without a rogue is currently being done, having to leave, and then taking another hour or so to gather people in a new hunting spot...the hours spent playing post 50 were also inveresely proportionate to the hours just running in circles), and the generally bizarre and vicious behavior exhibited by people protective of their spawns and loot.<br>
<br>
If you like raiding, post 50's great, as long as you aren't a class that just sits in the corner picking its toenails until it's time to buff everyone again.<br>
<br>
Not trying to disuade you from playing or anything...lots of people seem to enjoy the higher-end game...just offering my particular experience.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uvecartibus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Vecartibus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 20<br> <font color=#E9D756>(7/20/01 11:30:06 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Wanting advice</span><hr size=1> My advice would be to step away from EQ for a bit... experience real life for awhile, or another game you've been wanting to try.  DON'T delete your char / sell your char after you find out &quot; WOW!  There's life outside of EQ! &quot;  Most who've done that (who I know) . . . end up coming back even at the cost of starting over.<br>
<br>
Come back to the game after a week or longer . . . NOT when you feel compelled to &quot;keep up w/the Joneses&quot; but when you WANT to.<br>
<br>
I've taken many week and even month breaks from EQ.  I DON'T like the idea of it being LevelQuest after 50--it's very frustrating to hack, hack, hack . . . just for a teensy move towards your next level.  Perhaps if I could be guaranteed a group w/in 15 mins in OS or any other zone for that matter, EQ would be a different beast.<br>
<br>
I'm currently spending 3/4 of my game time in AO (I have top notch vid cards/computers/Cable modem though).  It's totally different than EQ... EQ isn't worth playing &lt;2 hours for me at level 53.  So, most of the time I have &lt;2 hours to play and I jump on AO (great graphics/sound/LAG), and get a sense of accomplishment.  If you don't have a great vid card/cpu I wouldn't recommend it though.  <br>
<br>
Anyway, I'm SURE I'll be back in full EQ form sooner or later ( I tried AC for about a month too before coming back to the fold).  Someday, we'll all put down EQ and I don't think we can predict when that will be... 2 years from now? or today?<br>

<br>
Unfortunatly, unless your in an Uber guild with the ability to explore the high end game, post 55 really doesnt do much for you. Im a druid so soling is a (very boring) option, as well as keeping the LFG tag up. But waiting for any type of group is so mundane.<br>
<br>
I reside in a small, great group of people type guild, we dont have the numbers or necessary classes/levels to do high end encounters, and people seem to be leaving for that reason as well.<br>
<br>
I used to stay online countless hours just chatting with friends, but it seems most have moved on as well. RL friends have left, online companions have left, so the normal hunting group is gone. Then you have the countless whining,moaning, and loot whorish people out there that just destroy the game in general.<br>
<br>
And if thats not bad enough, you think maybe the life in an Uber guild to see the high end game would be nice, but then you read the R&amp;F section on this board and see thats not even cracked up to be what it once was.<br>
<br>
Lately, even looking at the player populace on the server select screen, shows that there are less people playing than used to be. I assume partly due to AO and its release, and EQ high-end game mechanics.<br>
<br>
Sure you could grind to 60 for the exp, but for what cause? It used to be to see the cool new spells, obtain really cool loot, and have a good time with online friends while checking out new places. Well, the spells are mostly dropped and are sold for extensive amounts of cash, really cool loot requires a raiding force, alot of friends have left the game, and checking out new places is a suicide run without the force to penetrate the area.<br>
<br>
I personally have pretty much taken leave, only to log on occasionally, to look for an adventure group, or try to get guildies to do something insane(hehe),or to wander naked and aimlessly into places I know I prolly shouldnt be. Will wait till SoL comes out to see if some of the enthusiasm regains momentum, otherwise, I spose it will sit on the shelf with the rest of the titles collecting dust.<br>
<br>
Also for those that say, &quot;play a twink or something&quot;., tried that too, but to come to the realization that your still trying to achieve the levels to only be back in the same situation.<br>
<br>
Oh well, I guess focus on career, school, and making more money will bide my time until something else comes along that has that same &quot;spark of interest&quot;.<br>

If you see this give me a shout, i enjoyed knowing you what little i did while in the guild.  Overall my suggestion to anyone burned out would be to take noticeable time off, that is what i beleive the leader of my former guild has done, and many of the people in it too.

I actually like travelling about and discovering new stuff in the game (to kill), only every time I have done that recently, I've ended up wearing some kind of dragon-kin as a hat. Hence my post. <p><font color="#660000">

My first burnout came when my Pally kept dying and took ages to get anywhere, so I made a new main, my druid.<br>
<br>
I am now 53 and very close to 54, and I know 54 is gonna be fun!<br>
<br>
Anyway I got burned out while playing my druid, took a month off and I haven't taken more than a day off since then.  Taking that month off made me realize that I would be wasting the same amount of time watching movies, going to bars, etc.  IE Wasting time ANYWAY!<br>
<br>
At least in EQ you have over 1000 people at any given time, of which at least 50% are good people to chat with, help and do things with.<br>
<br>
I tried soloing and its usually boring, but you dtill chat while soloing, its not so bad.  I also notice post 50 that groups give a lot less exp, so I usually partner.  Of course unless I get in a good group in Velks Lab or something.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I have found many ways to keep the interest, with tradeskills, yes they are boring at times too, but can be fun depending on how you approach it.<br>
<br>
Also some quests I have done have kept my interest, including some of my epic stuff.<br>
<br>
I also find that getting new spells every level is nice.<br>
<br>
Additionally, I have started going on raids and leading raids to see new places.  As a druid you can see most zones that many never see.  Have you seen most of Velious?<br>
<br>
Lots of fun stuff in Velious.<br>
<br>
ANyway to the person who thinks Shadowbane is gonna change your heart, FORGET IT, Shadowbane is just like EQ, kill for exp to gain levels.<br>
<br>
Maybe SWG will do it for ya, no levels, no exp.<br>
<br>
Anyway I try to find things to make it enjoyable, and you also have to find out what excites you.  Whether its playing a different class or race or trying to find new quests.<br>
<br>
As a druid the prayer shawl quest has kept me excited even though it is difficult as hell (YES, I enjoy difficult things, maybe its why I still play)<br>
<br>
Well I hope you stick it out, yes exp is SLOW as hell in 51, best advice, dont focus on the exp and dont hunt in one place.  I also like to just walk by lowbies and sow or SLN them, do you know how excited they get.  I dont know what will work for you, just remember this is an adventure game, so go explore to see what makes you like it.<br>
<br>
Well anyway got to go work on my 5th shawl...<br>
And maybe kill a corrupt brownie! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Verant really has a good sense of how to raise the fun factor exponentially the more time you put into EQ.  You'll never find overcrowding, whiners, idiots or whatnot at 50+ because everyone by then is an expert and knows how to play their class along with every other class to their full potential!  In fact, head to KC or OS and get a taste of the 50+ game, you'll find it's gem you've ventured X years for.<br>
<br>
The fun is only beginning, what seems to be crawling exp is Verant's way of saying &quot;Don't bother with exp, just enjoy the fundamentals again...killing pretty looking mobs and getting the most overweight loot with no concern about your experience!&quot;  <br>

<br>
- Running around in EC bashing all the merchants and guards with Felonius.<br>
<br>
- Killing the high end mobs of EQ (at the time) - ie first Trakanon killing, first Lord Nagafen, first Lady Vox, first Derakor the Vindicator, etc..<br>
<br>
- Grouping with a bunch of friends and talking shit (and killing at the same time).<br>
<br>
I can never profess to having enjoyed EverQuest the way you're supposed to play it.  Killing big shit, talking shit, messing around, not doing what you're supposed to is where the fun was.  Getting xp, exploring new zones, role-playing, adventuring into new unknown places... 5 minutes into that you're fed up with it.  <br>
<br>
The most pathetic excuse for not enjoying EQ I've ever seen is *I'm not in an uber guild, I can't do that stuff*.  I'm sorry but *uber guilds* didn't just magically appear.  They worked to get where they are.  They bothered to do the things others didn't.  <br>
<br>
There are 2 ways to play EQ - 1) To succeed and beat the challenges of the game and 2) To have fun with your friends.  These do not mix.  You can't have your jolly band of flute-players dancing around and killing Vulak`Aerr.  Alternatively, you can't have your battle hardened warriors playing *jump the naked human off the docks and see who goes furthest*.  It just doesn't seem to work that way.  True friends are your friends.  Guildies are your play-friends.<br>
<br>
Basically what I'm saying is - if you want fun, make friends.  If you want success, join or create a guild and WORK to get things done.  You sound like the kind of guy that thinks.. fun &gt; success.  Who says you have to get higher levels to have fun? Took me 93 days played to hit 60 with Grinda.  Pyrastilia was on 190ish played days when I deleted and I had just barely scraped 60.  Being higher level doesn't mean it's more fun.  Just gives you the potential to HAVE more fun.<br>
