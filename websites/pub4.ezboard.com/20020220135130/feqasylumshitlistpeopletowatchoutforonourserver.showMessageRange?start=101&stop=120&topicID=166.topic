I wasn't at the mentioned Phinny raid but I have been on a couple of Glori's in the past and he can get phinny down rather quickly. His patience in waiting for whomever to get the thing rolling shows that he was willing to give people the shot at their pieces. And if he says he was promised a piece, why would he lie about it? Yes he wants his epic but at the cost of his good name.. not likely. You never mentioned why you &quot;no respect&quot; for Glorifundel from the past. Was he too busy to not port you one time? /sob..<br>

BTW i have no clue who uzziel is, but i can't let a good friend like Glorifundel get added to this post for doing jack shit. <p><center><img src="http://www.accesswave.ca/~falwith/Screenshots/Neosig.jpg"><br>51st Season Love Paladin<br>Coalition of Power<br>"One day, man will look back and say that I gave birth to the twentieth century"</center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ureitoc.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Reitoc</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t d00d!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(1/23/02 11:23:40 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=166.topic&index=102>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Glorifundel</span><hr size=1> Bah...Glori on the S***list???

I was on this Phinny raid that went wrong for the entire 4 1/2 hours it took place and I definitely remember it being said (not by glori) that since he is on last piece and HAO had defaulted the mage piece , he would get the wiz piece if it dropped. Funny thing is I wouldn't have even been there if it wasn't for Glori, he asked me to join him and Iris in killing phinny never mentioning HAO. When people were all bickering and leaving I was very tempted to myself but he talked me into staying to help HAO and him not Iris since the raid was being passed to HAO. IMO Glori did everything in his power to try to ensure a smooth raid (even though it wasn't). Now Uzi I saw but never said a word to him so I know nothing about him but to combine him and Glori is just wrong. He is too honorable a person to have his name mentioned here.<br>

As with Neo I have never even seen this Uzi fellow before. Nor was I at the Phinney raid in question. In fact, I do not know Glorifundel that well either; but I do know that he is one of the most patient people I have met to this day, and a clever tactician as well. I was at the same raid Neo mentioned, and Phinney went down quick an painless. No casualties, and Phinney must have lasted, eh, 30 seconds at most? In any case, his patience is unmatched. First hand example - 2 months or so ago he sold me a nifty caster belt for 200pp. I have still yet to all of it back (I will get that 62pp to you soon bud <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ). He has in no way hurried me to get him the payment, and we rarely are able to meet up; at the Phinney raid I payed him all I had on me at the time (138pp) and apologized for the delay - he shrugged it off with a 'np' and a smile. Perhaps I'm not making the best point here - this has nothing to do with raids, granted (and it doesn't say much for my character as well, lol). I am just trying to elaborate on his great style of play - if someone wrongs him or a friend, he WILL make it right at any cost. And as I said, his patience is uncomparable - I have seen few kinder and more forgiving than this wiz, even in the short time I've known him, and how someone could attemp to SL him is simply mind boggling to this humble enchanter. <p><center>Xizoesira Mentalis<br>46 CoP Mind Masher<br>Drunken Jeweler Extrodinaire<br></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ualadinsaneuk.showPublicProfile?language=EN>aladinsaneuk</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>p0\/\/3r-p0sT3r!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(1/23/02 1:45:56 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=166.topic&index=104>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.petedean.btinternet.co.uk/aladstyle.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Glorifundel</span><hr size=1> at the risk of this being a cop chorus....<br>

Glori is not in CoP - we are too young for him....<br>
<br>
having said that one of his alts is in the guild - and as most know, I do not suffer fools gladly and i always follow this board - all credit to glori's alt - this list was posted by him on our boards<br>
<br>
I was not on this raid - even as a guild leader i am a touch too young to be there :) - so i can not comment on what may or may not have happened - so i won't<br>
<br>
all i will say is that glori is not only known to us, but is almost one of us - he has helped many of us in many ways, and almost by return we are glad and proud to help him doing things....<br>
<br>
for the prosecution i will say one thing - and i think glori would agree with me on this - he says things as he views them - personally we have no problem with that - if you do - sorry<br>
<br>
unless a few things get posted here - like a log file for instance - I reckon a few words of apology or even "sorry - may have been a little rash" may well be in order <p><center>

<br>
I know Glori doesn't belong on the slist, because he is one of the least selfish and most giving people I know.  When I was working on Phinny he invited me on a raid with him and said I could have a roll on it as well (after we had  been down there for about 3 hours. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> )  Unfortunately that was a failed raid (I got my staff later that night).  I remember inspecting Glori when he was 52nd and seeing him in cloth armor and some other sad items. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  He's definitely not greedy or a loot whore!!<br>
I remember when I had all but given up on my staff of temp flux, he got a heart of fire from sola and MQ'd it with me, just so I'd have my staff. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

I remember hunting with Lyriannia in my teens. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I would log on and see a cheerful &quot;hello sis&quot; on my screen in minutes.  We grew apart a bit, but I've always enjoyed sitting down and catching up with Lyr.  I remember when one of my guildies had a problem with one of hers (when I was guildmistress of Dark Rituals).  It was a pleasure working things out with her. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

He goes out of his way to treat anyone, in or out of his group, with courtesy, respect, and friendliness.  He is generous with his time and will bend over backwards to help his friends.

I did not meet him with my main but with an alt although at that time main was only 28 or so. Long story short the body was missing in fv, gm was able to recover it after a few long hours, revived me and gated. Bent to loot corpse and was slain within seconds of rezz. Along comes a tell &quot;do you need some help?&quot;, he hands out 100pp to a cleric to rezz me, ports me out of Fv safely to Sro, then will not take a plat in return.<br>
<br>
Since that time we have become good friends and my main was able to catch up to him during a brief downtime. I have been on many the raid with Glor all around norrath as well as grouping with him often and he NEVER is greedy with loot or the like. As a matter of fact i would say he is at the other end of the spectrum and perhaps too generous.<br>

I find it disturbing that you would Sh***ist someone of his caliber who is truely one of the nicest people on this server.<br>
I dont know if you were having a bad day, were frustrated over your failed raid or honestly misunderstood something but you are in the wrong here.<br>

Had I desired to &quot;shitlist&quot; Glorifundel, I would have started a new thread and enumerated the many problems I and others have had with him. However, I choose to keep these things private.&quot;<br>
<br>
1.  posting here = not private<br>
2.  my friends not knowing what happened therefore their opinions don't count?  then why should random people in the SL's opinion count?<br>
3.  Degrading me and Uzziel in turn degrades Iris<br>
4.  If my brother didn't check the SL from time to time I wouldn't have even known I was mentioned here, you NEVER spoke to me about it in tells.<br>
5.  My friends good words don't matter, yet Austriana's good words about you count?<br>
<br>
If you wanted to keep it private you should have kept it there, just because you didn't make a seperate post doesn't make much difference to me, MY name is on the shitlist with a negative event regardless of if its a seperate post or not random people who don't know me will read and then make judgement on the matter.<br>
<br>
if you don't post again I will leave this alone, but for every post you make continueing this I will defend myself.<br>
<br>
Furthermore, did I, or did I not ask you if you wanted us gone?  I clearly remember asking you 3 times politely if you wanted Iris to leave, you could at any time have told us to leave and we would have.  It was your choice to have us there, not mine.<br>

Leaving Glorifundel's name under Uzziell's shit list complaining about him is SLing him, weither it is under Uzziell's board or not, also if your intent was not to SL anyone why post on the SL that makes absolutely no scence to me, if your intent was not to SL anyone post under the &quot;rants and raves&quot; im sorry but to me you seem to be contradicting yourself <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uereiakofneriak.showPublicProfile?language=EN>EreiakofNeriak</A> at: 1/24/02 6:25:01 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ubacanchigua.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bacan Chigua</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>n00b!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(1/24/02 7:12:16 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=166.topic&index=114>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Glorifundel</span><hr size=1> Im still chocked to see Glori name in this threads.

Anyways i know Glori since ages ago (at least a year i think) and im truly amazed about this, he has always been a nice person, caring and polite. I cant think of another reason for him to be here but as a misunderstanding. <p><BR><BR>

I wasn't at the raid in question, but I would stake anything that his actions were entirely honorable.<br>

I have known Glorifundel for quite awhile. He has ALWAYS been willing to help out others whether he knows them or not. I also just recently took part in a Phinny raid with him and just as Reitoc stated earlier Phinny died within moments(literally from the time the call to start nuking went out to the time I hit the assist button to highlight him, he was dead lol.) The raid that you were complaining about sounded like it went horribly for everyone, including Glorifundel, not just you and your guild so please do not drag good peoples names onto the sl just because you had a bad day. Oh and btw, the Phinny raid I took part in was a different one from Reitoc's, so I think that shows he is quite capable of leading raids and I look forward to participating in any others he hosts. Now lets get back to yelling at Uzziel lol.<br>

Not really. But it's time for you to take some responsibility. You can no longer claim  " he does and I don't" as a defense. By having this person who has proved over the coarse of 2 years and levels 1 - 60 that he will strive to KS , harass, backstab and all around just piss everyone off for fun you are promoting his actions in a passive way.  <br>

  If a person steals and you continue to employ them at your shop you are doing two things.  #1 saying it's ok for them to do so because they will not be punished by you. #2 Admitting that you are either to lazy or dependent on them to do anything.<br>
