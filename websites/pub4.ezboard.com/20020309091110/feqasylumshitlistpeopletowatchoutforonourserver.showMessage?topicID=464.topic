This is something that im sure will be solved..if not by me or kiras, by itself. My knowledge on this is very limited I spoke with many people before I chose to log tonight. Mainly two facts stand Nagafen was Ninja looted(everything I was told) except one item?<br>and Vaporise was the character used to do it. Vaporise is a rogue on my brother's account. As My brother is not home yet, (I have left NUMEROUS messages on cell phone to call me). Kiras was very hasty in writing this, I do not hold that against him, I would do the same thing being uber pissed as he is. I would request having Viewers of this post keep an open mind to several possible outcomes ..for example Someone else accesing my brother's password against his consent and doing this. If my brother did give away his account information then it would seem these actions will reflect somewhat and to a certain extent onto him.  Simple outcomes come first and are thought up by the mind before others, Such as My brother looting it, A few facts face he didn't but it is possible he was at a friends house doing it. Or hell..even possible he told a friend to do it.<br>        I am VERY tired, it is VERY late. I have left note for my brother to call me. If he does I will log on and see what I can do. as far as im concerned I have done everything in my power. I do not have My brother's account information..I called verant trying to find it, I lack the neccesary Identification to show it is mine althogh. Being that I don't have past bills pulled out and I forgot which credit card I use , Will research this after school in the morning. Please keep an open mind and Do not assume anything, Assumptions are the tools of fools.<br>      If those choose to flame me on my brother's actions or possible brother's account actions, Do so , I only hope any person with a Twinkle of intelligence Can see what kind of person you are.<br>I have done everything in my power tonight, and Am Now logging.

I was on all evening with Kiras helping him out and watching for _______ to log back in and get out of the dangerous location he was in.  I would like to disperse all the information that I have come across.<br><br>From what I can tell this started on Cicely's Naggy Raid, where a Lvl 25 monk by the Name of Jitsa wanted in on the roll's for Naggy loot who was taging along without invite.  When they had a Wipeout he volunteered to help pull corpses just to find out latter he tried to use that as a reason to be on loot roll.  When he was absolutely turned down, he swore he would ninja loot it.  He did not, or didn't get a chance.<br><br>Second Gleb Ran a Naggy Raid where Naggy was Ninja Looted and they did not catch the Crook.  When Kiras Approached Gleb he didn't know exactly who had ninja'd the corpse, but he had an Idea.  His Idea Matched up with our Crook Vaporise.<br><br>Third He Ninja Looted Naggy Again tonight.  We find out that Jitsa and Vaporise are the same person, and that he is Ultimikik Brother, and that they are all Member's of EoN, though I don't consider that Valid Information, that is Info EoN has so that they can kick him out of the guild, after his Suspension.<br><br>After trying many different thing's, and coming up with lot's of info, Kiras had the Bright idea of Going to Chat and try to talk to a Gm.  He get's back into the game infront of me, and say's he found a gm and she is logging on.  We formed a team and all discussed what had happened.
