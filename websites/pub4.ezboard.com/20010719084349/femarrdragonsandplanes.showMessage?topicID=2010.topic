-----------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
<br>
To give you all a background on what I'm about to talk about, Gulul is a level 51 Ogre Shaman. His RL son plays Gonga, a lvl 30 Ogre Shaman.<br>
<br>
Ober the course of the past week, I've had the displeasure of grouping with Gonga too many times.<br>
<br>
To criticize his personality and playing style are two different things. To put it bluntly, he doesn't know how to play a shaman. Big whoop, he cna always learn. But his personality?<br>
<br>
Well, firs, he goes LFG. Then, I allwoed him to join my group. He refused to follow any directions. When asked for buffs/heals, he would sit quitely. When oom, he would be standing. Also, he would go afk saying he'd be back in a half hour, and stay in groupp. Now that would be minor...if he didn't do it and repeat after being back less than 5 minutes.<br>
<br>
Well, We're at gators, and one person is a Saroe, a ShadowKnight. Someone tells me that a Decayed BP has dropped on the first floor of LMP so I pass this on to my group. We head to CY. I asked Gonga to give me and Saro Invis/See Invis so we coulf quickly get the BP.<br>
<br>
He wants to go.<br>
<br>
&quot;Gonga, you dont ahev to go, we'll be right back, and corpses decay in a short amount of time.&quot;<br>
<br>
But he insisted. While me, Saroe, and the warrior of the group (who also decided to come) are looking for the corpse, Gonga gets lsot in teh maze, but quickly finds CY. He DEMANDS we come back to him and lead him to the corpse. So, I asked him to hold tight, we'd be right back. Gonga disbands when Saroe looted the BP.<br>
<br>
Half the zone (bout 6ppl) erupt in OOC congratulating Saroe on the BP (my group, and the LMP group basically).<br>
<br>
After this, everytime I see Gonga LFG, a group member would suggest that he be picked up. I would explain that he isn't a good choice, but I'll take them if they want. Withing 15 minuts, the group is asking that he be kicked (while hes AFK).<br>
<br>
After that (3-4 days of it), no one would group with him (same faces in CT every night). I mean, the numerous things he did were trivial, that if anyone ahd done them, it would ahve been brushed away. But it was his constant stupidity, and brash attitude in group chat (whe he wasnt AFK) that did him in. Gonga isn't just dumb, hes reminiscent of a near fatal car crash victim trying to relearn how to tie their shoelaces. So we got to liking the current situation, with non-Gonga groups.<br>
<br>
Now, I see Gonga is in a certain guild. He was unguilded the say i met him, in a guild for 2 days after, then all of a sudden i see him in this guild, with a lvl 51 shaman (Gulgul) of the same guild in the same zone.<br>
<br>
I decided, agaisnt my better judgement, to offer some advice on Gulgul.<br>
<br>
I said that Gulgul may be a guildhop, doesn't know how to play his class, and worst of all is greedy and treats groupmates with disrespect. Also, going by the little I know of him, he may not evenw ant to be in your guild in 2-4 days. I know most high lvl guilds twink their lower lvl memebrs, but to protect you from being burned, I suggest you wait till this player (Gonga) proves himself to be a valuable guild member.<br>
<br>
Needless to say, my intent was to caution the guild of Gonga, not start a war or to get anyone booted from a guild.<br>
<br>
However, this is what happens (check link at top).<br>

<br>
Summar of the Screenshots(<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> :<br>
<br>
1) In here, he was questioning if I was a member of the guild Gonga used to be in. He is also questioning me further.<br>
<br>
2-3) In here, I answered his questions.<br>
<br>
&quot;I am warning you to be nice&quot; is not to be taken as &quot;I am telling you to be nice&quot; but isnteas as &quot;I am tryng to be nice by warning you of him (Gonga). A poorly worded reply on my part.<br>
<br>
4-<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Here's a doosey. So much was going on around me, I was not able to scroll far enough up to catch some things he said. So after shot 3, what happened was:<br>
<br>
Gulgul told me he that I am lucky he doesn't know me in real life, or he'd kick my ass for the comment I just made (see screenshot 2 or 3, the dumber than a treestump line). 4-8 is the conversation following that. <br>
<br>
Between 4 and 5, I missed a line where he claiemd I threatened him.<br>
<br>
In SS7, I have a line saying I did not threaten him, he threatened me, and I have a screenshot of it. I went through my screenshots to see that is the one I missed between 3 and 4, but I paraphrased the thing almost exactly.<br>
<br>
He seems to think I threatened him, I was reasonable at first. I never threatened him, nor did I threaten his son (Gonga). I did insult them both (to Gulgul), after the argument had escalated to the point where I could not reason with him. However, there is a difference between threats and insults. He didn't see that.<br>
<br>
I have spoken to a GM regarding this, on the chat server. I didn't /report anything, and if by going by what Gulgul said, all he got in his report me me saying I did not threathend you or your sone, but apparently the brains, or lack thereof, runs in your family. IE, he got a denial of what he was accusing, and a low blow.<br>
<br>
He can gaurantee my account gets banned <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  We'll see. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uglorianafrostglitter.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gloriana Frostglitter</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 516<br> <font color=#E9D756>(6/12/01 12:08:09 pm)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Why people with IQs &lt; 70 shouldn't play EQ (Gulgul)</span><hr size=1> So, basically...you sent a tell to some kid's Dad telling him that you thought his son was an idiot.  <br>

<br>
Still, I would have been awfully embarassed if I had made a faux pas like that.  I think I would have apologized profusely to the kid's dad instead of BRINGING IT TO THE BOARDS so everyone would know what an idiot I was.<br>

I think Medion ran into a little well-deserved parental ire.<br>

<br>
1) Yes, Gonga has a LONG way to go about learning how to play.  I made the mistake of inviting him to a group that was doing UTR afterwards.  He couldn't take suggestions that were helpful to the group.... He couldn't take a joke that actually had the entire group rolling on the floor (my &quot;rules about taunting&quot; hotbutton). So, he wound up disbanding himself and leaving.  OK, so I won't make the mistake of grouping with that child again.<br>
<br>
2) Dude, ya don't insult someone's Kid to their parent's face.  It's parental instinct to protect their kid's and defend them NO MATTER what they've done.  Besides no matter how silly Gonga is, Gulgul is actually a fairly well respected shammy on the server. <p><html>

BTW If my son played EQ and someone sent me the tells you did I would have reacted just like Gulgul. You just don't insult/threaten someone's kid to their face. No matter how bad at EQ they are.<br>

1)I initiated the converstaion, where I had no business to go. I was wrong there.<br>
<br>
2)I should have played my cards right. Even if Gulgul was not Gonga's father, I still should not ahve insulted him.<br>
<br>
3)Gonga told me he was 17, and turning 18 in July. If I had htought even for a second Gonga was younger, you know I would not have reacted the way I did. I would have been more patient and understanding.<br>
<br>
With that sad, I should respond to what was said about me and the situation here.<br>
<br>
Gloriana -&quot;I think Medion ran into a little well-deserved parental ire.&quot;<br>
<br>
Agreed. I have more respect for Gulgul than you think. Any parent should stick up for their child. If I ahd a kid, and I knew damn well he was wrong about somthing, I would still probably take his side. What I said was wrong, and I regret it.<br>
<br>
&quot;So, basically...you sent a tell to some kid's Dad telling him that you thought his son was an idiot. <br>
<br>
You are the idiot.<br>
<br>
God bless ignore, indeed.&quot;<br>
<br>
You tell XXXX &quot;I see you have invited Pidnus into your guild. I would like ti inform you that he is a known scammer and an idiot.&quot;<br>
<br>
XXX tells you &quot;I am Pidnus' father in real life.&quot;<br>
<br>
Gloriana, if this were you, what would you say? No, Gonga is nowwhere near the level of Pidnus, but my point is, so what if the person is his father, it doesn't change the original point. I was trying to warn a guild of a possible...how do I put this &quot;gracefully&quot;...member not worthy of membership? That person being his father doesn't change the point.<br>
<br>
&quot;Still, I would have been awfully embarassed if I had made a faux pas like that.&quot;<br>
<br>
Embarrased wasn't the word. I can't describe what I felt.<br>
<br>
Pinganon - &quot;I read 3 paragraphs of this then my head exploded.&quot;<br>
<br>
Understandable. I divided it up so it would be easier for people to read what they considered worth reading. I knew it would be nothing bu ranting once I hit the 2nd paragraph, and that it would not interest certain people.<br>
<br>
Soulslicer - &quot;I read 3 paragraphs of this then my head exploded.&quot;<br>
<br>
Alright, I'm gonna retype what was in the screenshots.<br>
<br>
Me: &quot;and I feel he is dumber than a tree stump&quot;<br>
<br>
Gulgul repsonded with a threat, which I deserved for insulting his son. So I said:<br>
<br>
&quot;Blah Blah, I apologize for insulting you and you son.&quot;<br>
<br>
I did not continue to insult him or his son after his threat, I did apolozizde. I kept this apologetic tone for a bit, till he started accusing me of threatening him and his son, which I never did.<br>
<br>
Shadon - &quot;Dude, ya don't insult someone's Kid to their parent's face.&quot;<br>
<br>
I didn't know that was his father. But again, that doesn't change the fact that what I said was totally wrong, and again, I apologize.<br>
<br>
Dunwut - &quot;the second you found out that Gonga was his son you should have apologized and dropped it. Continuing on just made you look like the one with an IQ&lt;70.&quot;<br>
<br>
Again, i did apologize, and dropped it. He is hte one who brought it abck up asking if I had threatened him. When I said &quot;I did not threaten you or your son&quot;, he accused me of threatening him.<br>
<br>
&quot;BTW If my son played EQ and someone sent me the tells you did I would have reacted just like Gulgul. You just don't insult/threaten someone's kid to their face. No matter how bad at EQ they are.&quot;<br>
<br>
I would have also reacted the same way. However, my insults didn't really concern his playing ability (like I&quot;m any better at playing my class...), more more around his attitude.<br>
<br>
Manifex - &quot;oh ya? well my dad can kick your dad's ass!&quot;<br>
<br>
You win, I don't have a dad.<br>
<br>
My point is, I did not threaten Gulgul nor did I threaten Gonga. I insulted, but i did not threaten. When Gulgul continued it (defending his son, I know), I sat there and took his insults, because I deserved it. I kept an apologetic tone. Then, he started accusing me of threatening, which i did not do. That is where I lost it. If I were to log on, and see him /telling me the same thing, I'd probably lose it again.<br>
<br>
And is there a chance me and Gulgul could fix things?<br>
<br>
I made a mistake, and so did he (accusing me of threatening).<br>
<br>
Since I was the first to make a mistake, and a serious one,  I should be the first to extend an open hand.<br>
<br>
Gulgul, and Gonga, I apologize for what I said. I truly regret it, and I hope you can forgive me.<br>
<br>
Do I stand by my original belief that Gonga isn't worth grouping with? No, not totally. I won't gruop with him due ot differences in our personalities, and that will likely remain. But I had no right to call him an idiot, and I totally retract that statement I made about him.<br>
<br>
Now, if Gulgul wants to apologize for his threat and accusation, that is fine. Chances are, he said what he said only out of defense for his son, and for that along, I respect him. What happens from here on is his decision. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/upinganonwindrider.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Pinganon Windrider</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 394<br> <font color=#E9D756>(6/12/01 10:00:11 pm)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.afflictionguild.com/scripts/images/Pinganon/Duckicon.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Why people with IQs &lt; 70 shouldn't play EQ (Gulgul)</span><hr size=1> Stop it.

Well, firs, he goes LFG. Then, I allwoed him to join my group. He refused to follow any directions. When asked for buffs/heals, he would sit quitely. When oom, he would be standing. Also, he would go afk saying he'd be back in a half hour, and stay in groupp. Now that would be minor...if he didn't do it and repeat after being back less than 5 minutes.<br>
----------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
seems here you have the low IQ. CT is still a lowbie dungeon. where ppl are still learning the ropes of the game.  if Gonga  couldnt play his character you shoulda told him as much and then booted him from your group. <br>
<br>
Noone willingly ties himself to a fool in a fight.<br>
<br>
The only reason I can think that you've posted this crap is maybe to make you feel more superior. and him and his father more stupid. but at the end i only feel sorry for them and see you as the asshole.<br>
<br>
Who do you think you are to give any advice to anyone anyways?<br>
Maybe once your well known in the world of EQ, but a messageboard reputation means jack.<br>
Besides, I have known a few &quot;guildhop's&quot; as you so blandly put it. better men than you i'd say from this post.<br>
<br>
I bet gogul  will learn alot from his new guild, hmm.... maybe you should do the same.<br>

I just think it is funny that you would tell someone in a guild about one of their members.  That in itself is funny.  He is obviously a low lvl since he was in CT, and he is still learning the game.  Now maybe if he scammed you, or trained your group or some shit that deserved a tell to another member, but not for being a young shaman still learning the class.<br>
<br>
I have seen a lot of your posts and wont say you are an idiot or such, but let me say that it doesnt show much class to mention someone's IQ as being low(even though IQs really dont show jack shit).  Normally you look worse off.<br>
<br>
Oh well, I know gulgul is a reasonable person and would probably just leave it be.

&quot;seems here you have the low IQ. CT is still a lowbie dungeon. where ppl are still learning the ropes of the game. if Gonga couldnt play his character you shoulda told him as much and then booted him from your group.&quot;<br>
<br>
No, my main beef with him was not in his ability to play his class. If I were to say that is my only porblem with a person, I'd be a hypocrite, as I'm no the best Paladin either...<br>
<br>
Here are some direct quotes from my original post, since you obviously didn't read it before.<br>
<br>
&quot;To criticize his personality and playing style are two different things. To put it bluntly, he doesn't know how to play a shaman. Big whoop, he cna always learn. But his personality?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;He refused to follow any directions.&quot;<br>
<br>
When you don't what you're doing, and 3 other people ina  group are tellign you to &quot;follow&quot;, &quot;stay put&quot;, or &quot;wait a sec&quot;, I'm assuming these are simple enough instructions to follow.<br>
<br>
&quot;Withing 15 minuts, the group is asking that he be kicked (while hes AFK).&quot;<br>
<br>
I obviously wasn't alone in my opinions on him.<br>
<br>
&quot;I mean, the numerous things he did were trivial, that if anyone ahd done them, it would ahve been brushed away. But it was his constant stupidity, and brash attitude in group chat&quot;<br>
<br>
And please, reread that LAST LINE<br>
<br>
&quot;and brash attitude in group chat&quot; <p><a href = "http://www.angelfire.com/games2/releases/index.html">Medion Palemoon</a><br>

<br>
Correct. Saroe was new to the zone. Only reason I wanted 2 invis rather than 4 was due to the unreliablity of the spell. I wanted to get him the BP and get out without having to do CR afterwords. (Gonga's faded after opening the maze door)<br>
<br>
Shortly after we looted to BP, I shouted to the zone that a train would be coming from LMP veryshortly, and to please exit the maze/CY/zone ent. so as not to hurt anyone. Afterwords, I healed as many as I could to make amends for any damage done (though no one died thankfully).<br>
<br>
If Saroe had know the way, I would have told him to get his BP, and congratulated him in advance <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><a href = "http://www.angelfire.com/games2/releases/index.html">Medion Palemoon</a><br>
