Need some advice.</span><hr size=1> I'm not flaming, nor am I asking for one. It's a simple question. (I am sure this will end up in R&amp;F so I thought I would save the moderators some work)<br>
<br>
My guild is currently camping RF in sky fire, we've gotten some pretty nasty attitudes from one guild in particular, saying they will KS him. I want opinions from more then one guild on this. RF is an epic mob, and has always been respected as a camp. Is this different now because he's moved to SF? <br>
<br>
I believe he has spawned 6 + times so far since the patch to move him to SF, was he camped by a cleric who's guild later took him down? I don't want to know the in the eyes of Verant crap, because honestly in Verant's eyes there isn't even a camp in a dungeon. King group in os could be petitioned (by an asshole of course) and the guide would have no choice but to share the spawn. Granted this may happen occasionally with jerks, but as a server in general that's not kosher.<br>
<br>
Any opinions? And why? I don't want to spend a week and a half camping him and spend a ton on my phone bill if he pops at 2 am and he will just be ks'd.<br>

<br>
I'd be pretty mad if I camped RageFire for days and then excited guildies /shouted &quot;yay RageFire&quot; and then other guilds got wind of it and, however well organized, popped up out of the blue and KSed it in front of me. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/unosfy.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Nosfy</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 340<br> <font color=#E9D756>(3/1/02 7:10:56 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3108.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Is RF a camp or FFA!

<br>
Though, when RF pop, there is a non-said limit of time to kill him. You have to gather fast and kill him. If you take (hypothetical time) 5 hours to gather, I can see a guild willing to take the spawn. Not that I approve that, but I could understand.<br>

Need some advice</span><hr size=1> Unfortunately, &quot;in the eyes of verant&quot;, is sometimes the important issue despite how we who get stuck camping the mob, make the rules we do. If Verant thinks something is ffa, and we treat it as ffa, someone who is camping it and gets ks'd is less likely to be the one voted for, if a gm gets involved. <br>
<br>
That being said, I am voting for ffa, in all honesty. I personally have not gotten my epic yet either, so I realize that that means that I could possibly get ks'd. I think, however, that we as the clerics, could set up some form of courtesy rules to abide by, but as I said somewhere else, NO ONE should be forced to waste 6 days of their life camping a spot on the ground, only to have it gangked out from under them. So I propose this:<br>
<br>
First team there with the force to kill him, gets him. None of this kiting around until your team arrives, while another team stands there waiting, crap. If you do have the first team there with enough people to make a VALID attempt, you will be given the space to make the attempt. Since as far as I know, 18 56-60s seems to be around the minimum you can do a kunark dragon with. So perhaps we set that as a precedent? None of this stacking the zone with 40s either because thats not a *valid* force.  If you wipe, and are not the only team waiting that particular spawn, it moves on to the next team. There should be no reason why RF depops because of 1 team wiping, no one wins. However if there is more than 1 team waiting after the first team wipes, how about a /ran 100 between the two ranking officers from each team? It obviously is the fairest, since because of the wipe, both teams had more than enough time to gather recruits, so by then, both probably have a valid force. Not to mention, that were a gm to get involved, they would do the exact same thing, they'd simply random it between the groups. <br>
<br>
Feedback would be preferable, flame if you want, though whether I take it with a grain of salt is wishful thinking<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  As a cleric without his epic, I'd be more than willing to adopt a cycle of this form. No one should honestly be ks'd of something they sat 6 days for, but no person in their right mind should be forced to sit a camp this long, then have to be barraged with tells of how they're going to be ks'd either.<br>

You need to post the name of the guild that is saying that they will KS it, and the name of the person who has been talking to you.  If you don't have the guts to post it, and they KS you, it's your own damned fault.<br>

<br>
The guild in question wouldnt probably even know of this post, except for one of their members frequents the boards.  I cant remember the name of the cleric, as I am stuck camping Rage when I should be sleeping, and am not exactly awake and coherant after 10 hours of sitting there.  Anam Kara is the guild, and the cleric is a lvl 60 who's name begins with an A that is about all I remember of her, aside from her major bitchy attitude.  Hell I am the one who's lacking sleep, and can still at least remain friendly.  <br>

<br>
1.  The cleric's character must be there, actively camping it, responding to camp checks.<br>
2.  There is a limit on how long after he pops you have to gather your forces and kill him.<br>
<br>
It has worked well on our server and we avoid many of the problems other servers have in regard to him.  <br>
<br>
I think it is common courtesy to follow those rules, and those who don't are just being selfish.  And there is no reason to bring Verant's rules into this because VI has a solid rule, there are no camps.  It comes down to us as a server acting like grown-ups and thinking of other people, rather than ourselves.

They did not take her kill but the cleric was mean and nasty all weekend and as far as I know fendellar talked to an officer and was basically told "tough shit, it's ffa." There are several points to consider here. <br>
<br>
As several people have said, EVERY camp "in the eyes of Verant" is not a camp. If you are camping anywhere in the world and someone /petitions you the chances are (per the rules) you have to share the camp. This even applies when there is no valid reason. I remember once back at level 20 in HHP someone went LD from our group and 5 minutes later we replaced them, but they logged back on and get bitchy. They then ran a level 45-50 warrior or pally (I forget exactly) 4 or 5 zones just to try to KS us. We both petitioned, and explained he can take a swing if he wants faction, ect. The GM said that despite the fact that he gets no exp and doesn't want faction we HAD to share the spawn. <br>
<br>
 Have to run more later... <br>

Granted it would probably be more hassle for the person running the VS/Trak rotation it would more than likely solve most of this. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ufiesti.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Fiesti</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 66<br> <font color=#E9D756>(3/1/02 8:19:39 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3108.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Is RF a camp or FFA!

<br>
I have a friend who is an officer in Anam Kara.  I spoke with him regarding the issues we had last week and I was not told &quot;tough shit&quot;....I am still awaiting some log files of the issues and I will forward them on to him.  He was comforting and was one of the people that looked out for my sanity for those 6 days.<br>
<br>
I have never ever had a problem with anyone in Anam Kara and I don't want to start now.  The cleric in question is someone who's been on several of our raids and as it's been pointed out, this camp can turn people for the worst.  <br>
<br>
I'm not going to flame her, but yes, she was unkind during our entire week there.  <br>

I know that english is not her first language and sometimes she has problems getting her meaning across so perhaps it's that which has caused the misunderstanding..? Hmmm, did the officers name begin with a T perchance? that would make sense, heh. Whatever tells you may have recieved I'm quite sure AK will never commit a 'true KS' against a guild that is in the process of buffing to hit Rage (for example).<br>
<br>
Speaking personally now though (shouldn't be considered an indicator of guild policy, it's just my position). Why should the fact that a cleric has massive amounts of free time and therefore the ability to camp the spawn automatically engender respect? What about all the really good clerics out there who have jobs and lives which would prevent them from doing so? If the answer is 'tough shit' then that seems about as fair as KS. Everybody'll love me for this but I'm more in favour of a rotation ala Trak or if worst comes to worst the 'sufficient force' arguement.<br>
<br>
Not an expert on camping procedures so if someone could enlighten me?<br>

I was going to put in all kinds of disclaimers and stuff later about how I got my information but I didn't have time. <br>
<br>
 Ok so about RF. <br>
<br>
 Saying that &quot;in the eyes of Verant&quot; it isn't a camp really doesn't mean anything. We play the game, and most people respsect others. People probably don't think of this, but everytime you call &quot;mill camped&quot;, or &quot;bat one&quot; or &quot;pit one&quot; (symbolizing a range of levels at which you might camp something) you are taking a chance that the people you are telling are not arse holes who will call a GM. IN the situation I described above in HHP, the guides told us and we wouldn't believe it so a GM came and finally it was the sever GM who came and said that if we don't have logs of him on another character making threats, then there is nothing for us to do but share the camp. He then proceded to sit there to make sure we were giving this guy who got no exp a fair share fo the gobbos down there. So to me &quot;in the eyes of Verant&quot; or &quot;verant meant for...&quot; are not valid aguments.<br>
<br>
 That said, I can see the wisdom of RF being a FFA where no one camps it and the first force there kills it, but then to ensure they are the first force people will sit a char there to check track or something. That is proably why clerics had to start sitting there in the first place. Personally, I don't forsee everyone agreeing to make it FFA because it cuts out smaller guilds to a degree, guilds who might band together to get this done but couldn't do it apart. Telling 4 guilds and all your friends takes alot longer than telling your guild who might have 40-50 people online, &quot;Hey guys RF is up lets run over.&quot;<br>
<br>
 If clerics and the people of E-marr decided to make it FFA, then I would hope it didnt just turn into ugly chaos. Maybe the first guild with 3 full groups including a cleric who needs it in the zone gets to make an attempt, as long as it is whitin 30 minutes. It might be possible for really together small guilds with allies, like VP/CBA, to manage to get a force there in time.  <br>
<br>
 I don't really care which way that it goes, both ways have valid reasons. But what I don't want to see is 2 or 3 (or 4 or 6) high-end guilds decide because of &quot;in the eyes of Verant&quot; or any other reason, that RF is now FFA. That means if a cleric HAS been sitting there for days they can take RF anyway. In MY eyes, and perhaps no one else's, if a cleric has arranged their schedule and stayed up all night and sat there through thick and thin, they at least deserve a chance to take it. Not all clerics whit thier epic are computer geeks who don't work and just sit at the comp all the time. Fend for instance works and I have no idea how she managed to get off work to do this camp, but I know that it will proabably we awhile before she can do it again... <br>
<br>
 So in closing, as long as everyone respects each other, each way can work. But people must understand that there is not a way (that i know of) to tell and take a vote with all of E-marr to decide it, so that there won't be anyone there camping it. I feel it would be unjust to force E-marr to go FFA by a few guilds taking some spawns from under the noses of clerics who have been camping them and saying &quot;FFA&quot;. <br>
<br>

I myself do not have 6 days to park it in sf and wait for him to spawn, nor would I even dream of asking anyone to sit the spawn with or for me. Isn't their epic, they got no obligation to sit it. <br>
<br>
If he pops, and some cleric is there camping it, but my team is the first there..well, I'm still not 100% decided, but either A, I'm taking it since my force was the first there, or if I'm feeling particularly nice, I'll give ya 30 minutes and 1 chance. <br>
<br>
I've had my pearl for over 7 months, and camped the solb spawn no fewer than 3 times. I've got well over 150 hours logged in that lair and I'm done with camping him. Every attempt I tried camping the solb, I got kicked out by some guild who was on during their primetime, while mine was at low numbers of people online. FG's would pop, and there was no way for me to gather people to kill them, so I was forced to give the lair up. I even got 60th level since I first got my pearl. My time is long past due, I've done my waiting, I've done my helping. Patience is a virtue I no longer have.<br>
