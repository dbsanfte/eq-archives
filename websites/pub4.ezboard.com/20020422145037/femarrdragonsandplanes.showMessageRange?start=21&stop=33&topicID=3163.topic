<br>
 My Original Quote:<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
 Wouldn't it be reasonable to say that anyone who committed murder or any such heinous act was insane? Certainly anyone who would do such things must have &quot;chemical imbalances&quot; in the brain, right? <br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Toxx's Response:<br>
<br>
&quot;I agree, and so does most of the civilized world (except good old America) USA, Japan, China. Those are, (from what I know) the only non-3rd world countries that use the death penalty. I believe most of the world has realized when something like this happens, something is wrong. Death is not always the answer.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
So, lemme get this straight here, Toxx.  You're willing to agree that anyone who commits these terrible acts is &quot;insane&quot; or &quot;chemically imbalanced&quot; and is therefore entirely devoid of responsibility for his/her actions?  I'm in awe at this logic or lack thereof.  I suppose any offenders like these who are innocent murderers/rapists/molesterors should be set free upon you neighborhood then...I certainly don't want them set free in mine.<br>

Those of us who suffer from a chemical imbalance (Clinical Depression here) were born that way.  Sometimes the imbalance doesn't set in until hormones release it during puberty.  However, having a bad childhood or miserable life doesn't give one a chemical imbalance.<br>

I'm not saying they serve no responsibility, I'm saying they are not entirely at fault. If someone is molested as a kid, and they grow up to do the same thing, how can we say the end criminal acted alone, out of his own free will? Granted, you can say &quot;He had freewill!&quot; How do you know this? The abuse he would have taken as a kid would have severely messed up his take on life and reality. <br>
<br>
We can sit here and have a shouting match over the death penalty, or we can drop it. I won't change your views, you won't change mine.<br>

My point here isn't that these imbalances don't exist...I believe they exist in every individual.  My point is that regardless of these imbalances, one is no less accountable for his or her actions than the next person should be.<br>

Perhaps you aren't as radical in your opinion as I had thought you were.  Yet, I think we've come to a point here where we'll agree to disagree.  I could never blame anyone else for something I did wrong, and I don't think anyone else should do that either.  That makes our opinions inherently different, and it seems as though both of us are pretty set into our positions there.<br>
<br>
Thanks for the discussion though.  I always like to hear the &quot;other side&quot; on controversial issues.  On occasion, it has actually altered my opinion, but that is quite rare.  Usually, it just reaffirms my position and gives me more knowledge for the next time the topic comes up.<br>
<br>
At least you're taking a position, and that's admirable in itself, although we still disagree, and of course, I think I'm right. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Stephen Douglass said something to this effect in the Lincoln- Douglass debates: &quot;The hottest places in hell are reserverd for those who have no opinion on controversial issues.&quot;  I firmly believe in that.<br>

Shouldn't ever put Carathos and Arikel in the same room together, then.  Might just explode from all the sexiness!  Certainly most young females would be in despair.<br>
<br>
Nisho, Clinical Depression has many causes, not all of which have to do with a chemical imbalance.  Medication helps those with a chemical imbalance.  Medication cannot help people who have a normal brain in a bad situation.  The only effect of family history on an actual chemical imbalance is genetic.  A child can inherit a genetic predisposition to Depression from a parent or grandparent.  Certainly a bad life can lead to Depression, but until a psychiatrist or similar tells me everything they told me before about chemical imbalaces was wrong and that scinece has been reversed, I'll stick to what I said above.  Having a negative experience doesn't suddenly change your brain's makeup.<br>

<br>
I'm not sure how to get into this without getting too technical, but yes, your experiences do actually change the make-up of your brain.  Various synapses are formed and certain hormonal changes occur based on environmental factors as well as inherent genetic factors.  Environmental stimuli (psychosocial stresses) do indeed alter the brain's chemical and physiologic make-up, and if your psychiatrist told you otherwise, perhaps you need to speak with another.  This is no reversal of science here...this is the science of behavior as it is understood today.<br>
<br>
There are essentially four major types of depression, with similar symptoms in each group.  Adjustment Disorder With Depressed Mood, Depressive Disorders (subcategories include major depressive disorder, dysthymia and premenstrual dysphoric disorder), Bipolar Disorders (also referred to as manic/depressive disorders which also include cyclothymic disorders) and Mood Disorders Secondary to Illness and Drugs.<br>
<br>
Anti-depressant medication plays a role in all four of these types of depression, although psychotherapy is vital as well, and some minor forms of clinical depression (particuarly depression associated with reactive disorders) do not typically call for tx with anti-depressant meds if not accompanied by vegetative signs or significant signs and symptoms which have persisted for more than a few weeks.<br>
<br>
The bottom line for all of these is that to be truly classified as clinical depression, a physiologic or metabolic abberation are considered to be causative, regardless of the inherent genetic or psychosocial factors associated with the origin of the situation.<br>
<br>
Also,<br>
QUOTE:<br>
&quot;The only effect of family history on an actual chemical imbalance is genetic.&quot;<br>
<br>
This statement is certainly not true.  If you understand how learning and environmental stimuli change the make-up of the brain, then this statement can't be true.  Living with a depressed mother or father also contributes to the possibility of the eventual development of depression in an individual based on learning secondary to exposure to these individuals.  It isn't just the genes they pass on to you that pre-dispose you to such &quot;chemical imbalances.&quot;<br>
<br>
So, what's the point here?  I dunno...I lost it somewhere along the way.  Must've been a synapse gone bad or one of my &quot;chemical imbalances&quot; actin' up again.<br>

Find a nice crowded city street...<br>
Bring Yates to it..<br>
Make a BIG display of it.. parade and all...<br>
Then hand out free blunt objects... Release Yates from her mobile cage (not bullet proof mind you)<br>
<br>
She now has a crowd of people wanting to kill her...<br>
Do you think any other sane (or remotely sane) person will want to do something like that (killing in general) if having about 5+ city blocks of people chasing you with blunt objects wanting to beat you with them?<br>
