<br>
So the so called &quot;civilized world&quot; is preparing for a war against &quot;organized international terrorism&quot;...<br>
<br>
George Bush said it will be the first big war in the 21st century, and that he will this war.<br>
<br>
I am just wondering what the goal of this war is...  kill every terrorist?<br>
<br>
Sure, killing Bin Laden might restore some of Americas pride...  but killing him will result in MANY fanatics giving their lives to kill as many innocent &quot;civilized&quot; people as possible...<br>
We are talking about killing an idol here... <br>
<br>
So...  what is the goal?  If there is no realistic goal (one that can be achieved), this war will never end... and how can anyone win a war that never ends?<br>
<br>
And what if the &quot;civilized world&quot; will loose this war...  i dont think many people thought about what the world could look like if this would happen...<br>
<br>
prolly just some random thoughts inside my little malfunctioning brain...  Im just looking help, looking for awnsers to simple questions, but i cant find em on tv or in the media, so i thought i'd give it a try and ask you people.<br>
<br>

<br>
How can we sanction (sp?) killing Bin Laden and his kind, without becoming a sort of terrorist ourselves?<br>
<br>
Dont get me wrong, I want this asshead dead just as much as anyone else. He has violated us as a nation, not to mention he has just plain ruined A LOT of lives by the destruction he has caused, and the loss of family members/friends is unforgivable.<br>
<br>
I, personally, didnt lose anyone close to me in NY (have EQ friends near there tho) , but I just cant watch CNN any more. I watched it for nearly 48 hours straight when this first happened, and Im not sure that I have any more tears to give. Im terrified every single time I hear a plane fly overhead (I live in St Louis, Lambert was among to be allowed to let planes fly).<br>
<br>
My personal take on all this is that we should go in and assassinate his ass. Maybe it will solve something, maybe it wont. But what the American people need right now is to feel better about something, to feel protected, to feel that our elected officials will actually DO something for us.<br>
<br>
hehe, I know I sound girlie, but dammit, we need closure on this whole thing. If not closure, then action. <br>

<br>
No, seek bin Laden's entire company and its defender's then all the hatred will wear a face. And bin Laden's speech liken's to a wind blown across it, felt by it, but a face that is tangible and shoot-able. No matter the number or slaughter, the choice of side and its shared fate is cast in steel upon that face. The face is terror, and murder, and rape, and deceit. You will know this face for it is a human face. {..rambles into incoherent paraphrases and parables of  The Apocolypse}<br>

The outcome will be very subjective. <br>
<br>
  In my own personal opinion, the goal of the American government and the rest of the civilized world will be to disable or limit the ability of these organized cells of terrorists.<br>
<br>
  In order to do this many things will need to be accomplished and will not be limited to Afghanistan and the Taliban. This country and government is just at the center of attention at this point in time and only now due to Bin Ladens presense there. If Bin Laden was in Iran we would all be looking at Iran.<br>
<br>
  Bush is going to sign documents in order limit monetary holdings of suspected terrorists in the US. Hit them in the pockets. How powerful would Bin Laden be today if he did not have 300 million dollars of his famlies money to play with?<br>
<br>
 This is just the beginning of a long drawn out conflict that will last for years and will have no definitive outcome. The more all the world cooperates the easier and shorter it will be.<br>
<br>
  To quote retired General Norman S. &quot;Bush did not just draw a line in the sand, he drove a bulldozer through it.&quot; This was in reference to Bush saying &quot;you are either with us, or with the terrorists&quot;. By not giving their full cooperation the Taliban is choosing their side. If they just would give him up they would avoid a lot of trouble.<br>
<br>
<br>
  In conclusion there will be no difinitive win/lose of this. If we or any other country in the world who helps can reduce the amount of terrorists, limit thier effectivness, diminish thier resources and numbers, then we win IMO.<br>

Let Bin lose his money and see how much of a martyr he becomes...let him roast in the pits he has to sit and tremble in, because he's brought this upon himself and his followers...then lets pull his dirty ass out of that pit and put him to a long drawn out degrading trial.  <br>
<br>
Think it was Rush Limbal that asked &quot;Why don't we see the terrorist faces?&quot;.  Why? Because that's what they want, they are Martyrs to be memorialized.  Kind of like the fact we haven't allowed them that pleasure.  And since suicide bombers, terrorist, religious fanatics have done so much damage, we can't just destroy one faction of them just to have another take it's place.  This type of mentality just has to be stopped all together.  Even Pakistan realizes this now, and disassociating itself from bin Laden's terrorist group.  And very possibly reconsidering the previous use of this type of action themselves (god I hope so).  <br>
<br>
I'm very surprised at Bush myself, I was no fan of the man and his presidential run.  But for now, I'm damn glad a Texan is sitting in that seat and pissed off right now. <p><Center><IMG SRC="http://www.lof.ukhq.co.uk/sigs/belgar.jpg"><BR><IT>
