Many have been arrested. The Israelis are in total control and there is no more fighting,” he told Reuters by telephone from inside the West Bank camp.<br>       Later Wednesday, about 300 camp residents, including fighters, women and children, surrendered to Israeli troops. It was not clear how many fighters were still holding out.<br>       At a nearby Israeli checkpoint, a long line of tanks and armored personnel carriers was parked by the roadside, apparently waiting to enter the camp. <br>       Newsweek’s Josh Hammer reported from a hillside overlooking the camp that some smoke was still rising over the warren of houses inside the camp, but that there was no more shooting. There were even kids wandering around the streets which had been the scene of deadly encounters between Israelis and Palestinians.<br>       On Tuesday, 14 Israeli soldiers were killed in the camp — 13 in an ambush and one in fighting later in the day. It was one of the worst losses sustained by the Israeli military in combat since the 1973 Mideast war. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br><br>Link: <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://msnbc.com/news/677951.asp">msnbc.com/news/677951.asp</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br> <p><B><font color=#00dd00>Rh</font><font color=#00cc00>ea</font><font color=#00bb00>to</font><font color=#00aa00>n</font> <font color=#009900>St</font><font color=#009900>or</font><font color=#008800>m</font><font color=#007700>ca</font><font color=#006600>st</font><BR><font color=#00dd00>54</font><font color=#00cc00>th</font> <font color=#00bb00>Se</font><font color=#00aa00>as</font><font color=#009900>on</font> <font color=#008800>Ma</font><font color=#007700>gi</font><font color=#006600>ci</font><font color=#005500>an</font><BR><font color=#00dd00>Co</font><font color=#00cc00>un</font><font color=#00bb00>ci</font><font color=#00aa00>l o</font><font color=#009900>f U</font><font color=#008800>nb</font><font color=#007700>ro</font><font color=#006600>ke</font><font color=#005500>n H</font><font color=#004400>on</font><font color=#003300>or</font></B><BR><a href="http://unbrokenhonor.homestead.com/" target="_blank"><img src="http://unbrokenhonor.homestead.com/files/rheaton5.jpg" border="0"></a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ulurikeen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lurikeen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 472<br> <font color=#E9D756>(4/10/02 9:41:17 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=291.topic&index=2>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Israeli Soldiers killing Innocent Palesinians again?</span><hr size=1> I agree with you Rheaton.

Freedom fighters or terrorists?  There are very few people in the world who enjoy tormenting, terrorizing, raping, murdering others.  Any type of crime can somehow be deemed terrorist.  <br><br>  Obviously, Palestinine is motivating its people with nationalist proaganda.  Their territory is being occupied and SETTLED by Israelis.  So, for them it is a freedom fight.  However, if it ever became obvious that it was not a freedom-fight and people(like the Taliban) were wearing civilian-like clothes then it is obvious they are taking advantage of the innocent.  THAT is a crime.  IMO, the Palestinians who fled to the Church of the Nativity are trash because they knew if they fled there they would be safe.  <br><br>  The ONLY thing Israel can logically do, is pull out, move borders back to 1967 and if they are attacked by terrorists BOMB the fvcking hell out of those countries supporting them.  Israel is doing bad things also.  They can only try and start over.  Yep, I'm sure they would hate to do that but that is their only choice since Hezbollah, Islamic Jihad and all of those other groups are so deeply intrenched in the surrounding territory.  Give Palestine their land back, allow for America to send economic aid to Palestine, build it up so Palestinians can live a decent life.  Funny isn't it, you don't see millionares or even middle-class folk blowing themselves up do you?<br><br>   All-in-all, they will be finding a reason to kill each other for a long-ass time.  They need improved economic conditions to stop the killings.   Just like gangs in the inner cities of America.<br>However, because they will be killing each other over religious reasons, we should butt the hell out.  Israel is no more innocent or wrong than Palestine or anyone else in this shi+hole of a world we have. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ubrutas222.showPublicProfile?language=EN>brutas222</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 246<br> <font color=#E9D756>(4/10/02 12:00:03 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=291.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Israeli Soldiers killing Innocent Palesinians again?</span><hr size=1>   Just wanted to say one more thing.  If I was in control of a country and terrorists were taking advantage of the fact that I had a policy of avoiding civilian casualties at all cost and the opposing leader took advantage of this by ordering the killing of innocent civilians,  I would order, without hesitation that a big fvking bomb be dropped right smackdab in the middle of a city full of innocent people.  THE ONLY way to stop terrorism immediately is to fight fire with fire.  The only other way to defeat terrorism is to improve the lives of people who are suffering and have nothing to lose by blowing themsleves up.  Give value to life.  Unfortunatly, the latter takes a hell of alot more time.  <br><br>Governments around the world need to recognize the affects economic war has on those caught in the crossfire.  If they don't, countries will be murdered, raped and mugged just like the rich are in a country full of poor.  Simple human nature, not complicated religious ideals.  <br><br>Ever wonder why Bill Gates doesn't go strolling around through Compton?  Well, its the same idea with the rich countries int he world and the poor countries.  <br><br>I have an idea to distribute quality of life throughout the world.  Its similar to the way we put boundaries on sports teams in America.  Of course this idea would not start wholescale, rather, it would begine in a test phase and encourage those to join with government subsidies and tax breaks.  It would be like a company is a team, like the Miami Dolphins;  if the Miami Dophins are the equivalent to Bangldesh's economic gains, they would get the first pick in the draft.  This draft would be a draft of monetary grants and grants of partially open markets.  For instance, if Gateway has the best selling computer store in the country,  then Compaq(because it didnt sell well last year) would be allowed to sell in that location.  Basically, the Spirit-of-competition is such because it recognizes that there is no such thing as a winer if not the loser.  They are dependent on each other and are necassary for evolution, creativity etc......   We need to stop playing unfair.  <br><br>EXAMPLE;  American corporation is to Shaquille O'Neil as Bangladesh is to your Grandma.   Banglesdesh could only win if the world economy was based on laughter.  However, stavation, poverty, hate etc.. are no laughing matter.<br><br>Fair competition will make this world a better place and will give to those who deserve it and not those who want to sit on their ass and play the victim all the time. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ulithahntalon.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lith Ahntalon</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/image/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 267<br> <font color=#E9D756>(4/10/02 2:02:35 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=291.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Israeli Soldiers killing Innocent Palesinians again?</span><hr size=1> Something else to think about.

How can you possibly feel sorry for the 100 or so 'civilians' working in this 'bomb factory' - clearly a place meant to make bombs for more suicide bombers.  If I go around making bombs for people to use to blow up restraunts and bars, am I still a 'civilian'?  Does it even matter at that point?<br><br>Arafat has for years encouraged his people (in Arabic) to commit terrorist acts against Israel, while simultaneously talking peace to the US media.  Bush alluded to this when he and Powell said that Arafat should denounce terrorism to *his* people, *in Arabic*, as opposed to paying lip service to the west's weak minded press in Englinsh.<br><br>Don't forget, it was the PA (Palestinian Authority) that threatened US journalists to make them stop filiming and not report the celebrations going on in the Palestinian areas after 9-11.  Those celebrations never did get much press coverage, and the press clearly went out of its way not to draw any of the obvious conclusions one could make from such observations.<br><br>These facts alone should give people some clue as to what these people are.

Its crucial to understand the 'other' point-of-view when tackling such a complicated issue.  Our news media is extremely biased towards the Israelis and tends to place blame on the Palestinians.  <br><br>  When it all boils down, the Israelis AND Palestinians have dont 'bad' things.  To a certain degree, the Palestinians are freedom fighters, though they have gone about it in a less than honorable way.  The Palestinians were taken advantage of when their land was partitioned by the U.N.  Actually, the UN proposal was significantly different than the present day Israeli borders(That information is provided on a BBC link)  <br><br>Anyway, neither of them are innocent and neither of them are completely guilty.  If you don't see this, you must have a bias.  Ultimately, we should not be supporting Israel as much as we do.  In fact, we should be providing much more monetary assistance to Palestine in hopes that improvement in their lives would stop the hopeless/ helpless attitude they express.  <br><br>  Warangle1, in response to you stating the Palestinians should be pushed out of the country;  they already have been you idiot.  Have you not heard of the millions of Palestinian refugees that Israel would not allow to return?  Have you not heard of the Israeli government encouraging the settlement of the West Bank and Gaza Strip?  I think you are the one with some major biases.  You are choosing to be Ignorant about the reality of the matter at hand.  <br><br>  Do you think the CIA, FBI and other government agencies dont read what the Tehran Times is publishing?  They keep an openmind about what is going on so they can learn the Truth and not what the media is writing.  There are very very few people in the world who are pure criminals(IE someone who lies or hurts someone for the pleasure of it or total disregard of someone elses needs to fullfill their own)  People are feeling so strongly about the Israeli/Palestinian issue because there is an element of truth you fail to see.

Hence the title.  Once again, the Jews are the only victims in the world.  Support them because you owe them, as a responsible Christian you should support God's chosen people.  Right?   I don't agree.  Anyone who uses God's chosen people as a reason to Own or Take is using it in a nationalistic context. <br><br> I was talking to a professor today and she was astounded that the Israelis of all people could act so racially self-centered as they do.  I mean, you wouldn't expect it from a people who had a large percentage of their people murdered in the name of racial selfishness and self-centeredness.  But i guess if they are God's chosen people they can do whatever the hell they want.  Ahh, Zionist nationalism at its best. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/urheaton.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Rheaton</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 120<br> <font color=#E9D756>(4/12/02 10:27:40 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=291.topic&index=20>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Maeri Quotes Tehran Times as a legit news source</span><hr size=1> Aaaaaaaaack!
