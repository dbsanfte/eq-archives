<br>
Something about that bugs me big time....  I heard something about a new ranger epic type weapon... hope it's true... I like being different.<br>
<br>
<br>
If I could have any weapon in the game it would be tolan's longsword of the glade =) I'd use that and my ethereal longsword and be a happy camper forever LOL<br>
<br>
I think they need many different epics maybe like 2 or 3 per class.... and before you go &quot;well it's epic it's meant to be the best&quot; oh come on look at the other droppable weapons out there =)<br>

I've yet to see the stats on it yet... I doubt thats its up to par with either of the quested epics nor tolans longsword of the glade( which there is only one of on the server that I know of and Elidrin has it*correct me if im wrong*)  As for 2 or 3 epics, that maybe cool, but at the same time, would they really be that different?

There really should be a greater variety of high-end, quested weapons in the game.  Why are there not any class-specific weapon quests to go with velious armors?  What about an epic bow for rangers?  An epic staff for monk (maybe turn ton po's into a quest, since it doesn't drop)?  How about an epic drum or lute for bards?  Shaman have an epic spear, but what about an epic staff that procs slow?<br>

There are tons of armor quests in the game now; lets see some more weapons, durn it! <p>Shallandra, 60 Grandmaster<br>

Take the following bow for example:<br>
<br>
Bow of the Huntsman<br>
DMG: 20 - DLY: 30 - DPS: 13.67 (MAGIC - LORE - NO DROP)<br>
Effect: Spirit Strike<br>
<br>
A good well-balanced group of 50+ can walk into Kael, kill Dragonhunter Gleed (53 - 56) and get this bow in an hour or less.  No quest.  No PoA.  No raid required.<br>
<br>
I mean rangers need a good epic bow that has like a 30/35 ratio or something, at least.  Something close to (but not quite) a 1/1 ratio.  Lets face it, 59+ rangers with endless quiver can kick some serious butt; they need a good bow to untap the full power of their archery talents.  The only thing close is a ST drop and, lets be honest, there are currently only two guilds on the server capable of doing that at the moment.  Kind of screws the rest of the ranjahs.<br>
<br>
This isn't a ranger problem either.  The vast majority of items that either compare to or exceed epic weapons drops only in zones of epic difficulty; sleeper's tomb, north wing of ToV, Ssraeahza Temple, etc.<br>
<br>
How many guilds can do these zones?  One or two at best.  Smaller guilds have no way of acquiring alternative high end weapons.  Take the following weapon, the best pre-epic (IMO) for example:<br>
<br>
Nature's Defender<br>
Armor Class 45<br>
DMG: 38 - DLY: 46 - DPS: 16.74<br>
Attributes: +10 STR, +10 DEX, +10 WIS, +25 HP, +25 MANA, +15 DR, +15 PR<br>
Effect: Natures Holy Wrath (Stun + 150pt DoT)<br>
CLASS: PAL - RACE: HIE, HEF<br>
<br>
QUEST DETAILS<br>
---------------<br>
Talk to Guardian of Takish who can be found in the Plane of Growth. Tell him that you are a knight and he will ask you if you will help him in killing the corrupter of life. Tell him you will and he'll ask you to bring him the following items. The Fleshless Skull which drops off the Corrupter of Life who spawns in the Plane of Hate. The last three items all can be obtained in the Wakening Lands, off corrupted beasts. You will need some Corrupted Faun Skin which drops off the Corrupted Faun, the Corrupted Panther Skin which is dropped by the Corrupted Panther, and the Corrupted Unicorn Skin which is dropped by the Corrupted Unicorn. Return with all four items and you'll be rewarded with the Nature's Defender.<br>
<br>
That can be done by the majority of the 50+, higher level guilds on the server.  And, I for one, think thats what the game needs more of: high-end weapon quests.  Though it wouldn't give high-level players easy access to the best weapons in the game, it would give them a chance at alternatives, based on what they can accomplish at the time.<br>
<br>
For players like me, who prefer a specific style of weapon, it would also give us more creative control over characters.  I like 2HB weapons on my monk; as far as I'm concerned, the epic is about half worthless except for stats.  That's just my play style.  Its how I percieve my character.  I like 2HB.<br>
<br>
Which is my curse, for my monk has a RFS and short of the tranquil staff, which is VERY expensive and is a pain to camp, the only upgrades available are in Sleeper's Tomb, Veeshan's Peak, and the northern wing of Temple of Veeshan.  I don't see myself going there anytime soon.<br>
<br>
Personally, I would love to have a Ton Po's Bo Staff of Understanding.  Supposed to drop off of Trak, but it never made it off the test server.<br>
<br>
Tranquil Staff<br>
Dmg: 29 - DLY: 30 - DPS: 19.67<br>
Effect: One Hundred Blows (120pt DD + stun)<br>
Wt: 10.0 - Class: MNK - Race: ALL<br>
<br>
Ton Po's Bo Staff of Understanding<br>
DMG: 44 - DLY: 40 - DPS: 22.25<br>
Effect: One Hundred Blows (120pt DD + stun)<br>
Wt: 2.5 - Class: MNK - Race: ALL<br>
<br>
The weapons are very similar.  The advantage of the Bo Staff of Understanding is that it is lighter, and has a better DPS.  Perhaps an upgrade quest could exist for the TS that would turn it into this weapon.<br>
<br>
In example, maybe in TT there is a new mob named Disciple of Po.  While talking with the NPC, it explains how he came to possess a powerful weapon, handed to him by the great master Ton Po.  He might be persuaded to part with it, should he find someone worthy of it. When asked how to prove one's worth, he explains that one must challenge and defeat the masters of mind, body, and spirit, and give an &quot;offering&quot; worthy to replace that which he shall surrender.<br>
<br>
So a monk would have to go off through Kunark and perhaps the old world or planes to defeat 3 named mobs similar in difficulty to the epic mobs, and, after obtaining the last master drop, go back to the disciple of po.  Upon turning in the item drop(s) and a tranquil staff, you get the Ton Po's Bo Staff of Understanding.<br>
<br>
It wouldn't be so much awarding an item as upgrading it.  Hell, the reward is no better than the Celestial Fists, and the rare component (TS) is very hard/expensive to acquire.<br>
<br>
I could also see racial weapon quests.  For example, shouldn't dwarven warriors have a good axe quest?  That or a hammer.  Trolls and ogres should be able to quest for a kick-ass maul.  Considering rogues can only crit with thrown weapons, there should be some sort of &quot;returning&quot; dagger, with good stats, they can play with.<br>
<br>
Dunno about the rest of the melee, but yah, all the armor quests are nice, but damn... couldn't we have a few more high-end weapon quests too? <p>Shallandra, 60 Grandmaster<br>

There is a monk item as well: All velious monk bracers (SS, Kael, Thurg, and PoG) can cast Pouch of Quellious; the effect creates one no rent, no weight pouch (small items only) and 60 shuriken of quellious, an excellent ranged pulling item.<br>
<br>
As for the arrows... aye.  There should be an item like that in the game.  Of course, with the release of Luclin there may now be.  I wanted an item that would summon bandages for the longest time (BW &gt; cleric, muhaha); seems there is just such an item (no drop) in Grieg's End.  May be some sort of &quot;quiver&quot; that summons arrows out there, just as yet undiscovered.<br>
<br>
On a happy note, however, Luclin-enabled 59+ rangers can acquire a skill through the optional advancement system called Endless Quiver.  This basically negates the ranger's need for ammo.  They need only one arrow of the type they wish to fire, and arrows are &quot;magically&quot; created every shot.  Cool skill.  Reminds me of that old Dungeons and Dragons cartoon.<br>
<br>
Now, if they could make some interesting magical arrows to use in conjunction with the Endless Quiver skill...  Heh, wouldn't that be something? <p>Shallandra, 60 Grandmaster<br>

The Bo Staff existed in the past.  It was destroyed at the close of the kunark beta.  Some people did receive this item, prior to it being removed from Trakanon's drop tables.  It was removed, however, as VI considered it too powerful.  I guess at the time, monk agro being what it was, that could be true.<br>
<br>
With the release of the epic, and NToV weapons though... I see no reason why they couldn't put an item like this back into the game as a quest item, or a VP drop (which it may already be).  Basically just a lighter, better version of the TS.  /shrug <p>Shallandra, 60 Grandmaster<br>

<br>
Actually I go on about much more than that (why would a Holy Warrior of Brell Serilis *REALLY* give a flying fuck about the Marr twins and their causes, anyway?  or a Erudite SK kowtow to anyone but the God of Fear Himself?)<br>
<br>
I won't go too far into my rant, as it is off-topic, but if it were my game, I would not have gone the multiple-hybrid route, but instead made a &quot;Knight&quot; class that had diety-specific spell, armor, and weapon quests, culminating an a diety-specific epic weapon/shield/armor/ability set.<br>
<br>
My first serious character was a Dorf Pally, and I have a strong roleplaying background.  The major reason I dropped him was because in my mind I couldn't justify why a dorf who had dedicated his life to Brell, the Duke of Below, a pretty Lawful Neutral kind of diety, would end up spending the vast majority of his career running around doing the bidding of an essential Neutral Good set of dieties.  <br>
<br>
Anyway, I'll stop now.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Sorry for taking the conversation off-topic.   <p><center><img src="http://www.darke.net/journalpix/bearne.jpg"><BR>

I think some had the SoL damage bonuses eg. +4 fire dmg etc, and there seemed to be quite a few types. Those plus the endless quiver could be interesting. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><br>

With a raincaller (20 dmg) I was getting 200 dmg crits with 8 dmg arrows back when I was still high enough level to do double damage.  I think with a 70-dmg bow (not that I could've gotten one then--this is just for comparison), I'd have been doing 600+ crits on mobs that are standing still *without Trueshot*.  I can only imagine what that'd be like with AA skills and spells stacked on it.  Then there are the stats... I doubt they'd ever let us stack stats like those with those that you find on melee weapons.<br>
<br>
Personally, I'd like to see a nice Karana-only bow (a Raincaller upgrade) go into the game to make up for our lack of the Helm of the Tracker.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><img src="http://home.swbell.net/sdspies/images/caederesig.jpg" BORDER="0" WIDTH="216"

Aye, that is a good knife.  Irks me that monks can't use.  But, on a larger scale, the item was annoying in that the effect was a proc, rather than a right-click effect.  Be hell if your low on bandages, and need some more...<br>
<br>
&quot;Excuse me a minute group.  I need to go kill something for bandages.&quot;<br>
<br>
Hehe... good at lower levels, but in the higher-end game, no thanks.  Right-click item only, please <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>Shallandra, 60 Grandmaster<br>
