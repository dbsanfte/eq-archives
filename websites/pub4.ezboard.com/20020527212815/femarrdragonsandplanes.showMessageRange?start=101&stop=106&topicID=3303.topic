Quote:<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
 When black children see people who look like them, what do they see them doing? They see high-profile sportsmen and sportswomen, they see musicians and actors. They don't see accountants, scientists or doctors.<br>

On TV right?  Didn't her article talk about her influences coming from TV she watched?  What do you see on TV?  Sports people, musicians and actors.  How many white scientists can you name?  How many white acountants do you see on TV?  That's right..you dont see them there either.  <br>
<br>
The scientist part killed me.  I'm VERY science oriented (started college as a pre-med chemistry/biology dual major) and do you know the FIRST scientist I thought about (black or white)?  It was George Washington Carver.  An awesome BLACK scientist who contributed so much to mankind that he stands out more in my mind than any other from my childhood education.  I thought of Einstein next, I'd say that puts Carver in pretty good company.<br>
<br>
To the moron who's comments adorn that article (not you Maeri), if you dont want your children having entertainers as role models, I suggest you look somewhere besides television for them.<br>
<br>

Maybe it's because they stress mathematics so much in their educational structure, or maybe it's from all my asian friends in college that helped me with calc as I helped them program.

<br>
I in know way tried to insult anyones race in any form I was stating public facts and things I know from my childhood. Yes racisim can go both ways but as a White person you can relate in this area in a smaller amount. (im not sure you nor I understand what i just said so let me explain)<br>
<br>
When I say a racial tense area, Im talking about an area where 1 out of 3 people belong to or support the actions of the KKK. Im not talking about some normal black guy living in white suburbia. <br>
<br>
Ive lived on both sides of the fence here so Ive seen how it plays from one extreme to the other. <br>
<br>
Now your post was very good until you had the gall to tell me what I should or should not say about what i know about my ancestors. When i said black history I was specificaly talking about black american history. I am not african and my ancestors mostly came from spain, I could give a flying fvck about what you think I shouldnt be able to talk about. The only reason i said that was because the past has relevance here because the same acts are happening in mordern day america , just in a different form. Im know activist im just a normal guy stating what he knows from expirence and school.<br>
<br>
This is the problem from the original problem and I can sum it all in one word, FEAR. No not every cop is out to get me or anyone else BUT what about the other cop. Life is not everquest where I can con said cop and see if he scowls at me for no damn reason. <br>
<br>
All im saying is that exist and its out there every single day. Most white people i know think the world is just peachy and black people should shut the fvck up anytime we speak out against something.<br>
<br>
im glad that you are teaching your children that hell i wish most people would teach there children that BUT its not like that is it. Labels are out there for the clothes you wear, hair style you choose, piercings, skin color or what color eyes you have. These labels are part of the human psyche plain and simple. Its how YOU as a person judge the other person before approaching them in any form or way.<br>
<br>
You cant tell me you dont make some sort of prejudgemental assumptions about people by there outside appearence. Granted those assuptions can be completely off base and wrong that doesnt mean you didnt have them.<br>
<br>
i never said anyone is out the get &quot;me&quot; lol I live in white surburbia &quot;now&quot; and im having fun with people like that runt mismort. hell hes my best friend in RL and hes white. I was just stating in the inner city areas that was and is the mentality. You have to live there to know theres probably no way i can sit here and type up a procedure for you to understand the inner city black mindset.<br>
<br>
Oh well me go back to work now<br>

<br>
<br>
     I can appreciate what you are saying but, it goes both ways. My first assignment, one that wound up lasting five years, was in the &quot;inner city.&quot; Fresh out of the academy I hit the streets with my FTO (I worked in the county jail for two years prior so I figure nothing can be worse than that). My first week went with a few things like this. 3 AM driving down the street with my FTO (Field Training Officer) 10 year old kids flipping off the marked unit yelling &quot;phuck the police.&quot;, a domestic where the man was trying to kill his wife with a hatchet, we break it up and quite frankly are lenient in using OC (pepper mace) to subdue him rather than a baton or a firearm. Wound up in Internal Affairs a couple weeks later because the WIFE said we used excessive force (yea, the same woman who was about to be chopped up if not for us) and clamed racism in the arrest. A motor vehile chase from another agency wound up stopping in our city this vehicvle while running  from a lawful attempt to stop it hit quite a few parked cars before we finally got it stopped. The owners of the damaged cars were angry at the police for &quot;arresting another black man&quot; and blamed us for the damage to their cars. Yea, it is a two way street, give a little respect, get a little as far as I am concerned. <br>
<br>
     I found the respect thing to be very true. After being released from my field traing program I was given, probably the shittyest beat in the city. about 12 block by 12 blocks in size and there was more dope and prostitution there than you could shake a stick at. I had to earn the respect of the people in that beat. How did I do this? By being consistant, fair, treating folks as I would expect to be treated and doing it by the book. Most of the folks didn't like me still ( I am blond, of German decent with a good German name and grew up in a rural area giving me a thick south Georgia drawl), they saw that I was FAIR and made arrests based on good legal precident and was not trying to railroad them. Those that didn't know me instantly thought white cop cracker, I could see it in thier actions and most of the times words. In my five years spent there I have been called names I still do not know the meaning of, shot at, hospitalized twice, been to Internal Affairs three times on bogus claims, sued once (again bogus) and threatened more times than I can count (in uniform and out).<br>
<br>
There are two sides to the story. You cannot fail to give someone respect and in turn expect to get it back. Even today as I work city wide I STILL get the &quot;oh jeez who is this cracker in uniform&quot; a lot. People want respect, give it back is all I have to say. As a side note though I did run across a goodly number of nice folks on my beat that I would have been happy to call neighbor if the moved in next to me but, for the most part that is the exception and not the rule where I worked.  <p><img src=http://eshamlin.home.mindspring.com/lith.jpg></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uceldor.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Celdor</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 1863<br> <font color=#E9D756>(5/3/02 5:17:12 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3303.topic&index=104>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Cops</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> God, I just love the new highspeed internet connection in my jail cell...<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

As a current 22 yr old, I wasn't in high school too long ago.  From what I saw there, I believe that some black people, including ones *I* would consider to by my elders, seem to believe that being intelligent (i.e., &quot;acting white&quot; or &quot;being an &quot;Uncle Tom&quot;) or using reason over force/intimidation to solve problems somehow diminishes them or makes them a sell-out.  I have a great deal of difficulty trying to figure out how someone could get such a screwed up notion into their heads, be they black, white, pink, green, etc.  <br>
<br>
I personally feel it has more to do with the anger/fear psyche promulgated by many forms of entertainment and fellowship(i.e., rap, excessively violent music/movies/TV shows, street gangs), combined with a lack of parental care and instillation of any real values, such as the right of others to have their property and other beings right to live. <p><img src=http://banton.20megsfree.com/Sigs/EcoFreak.jpg>
