<br>
Barrelrider thinks that Kelewala owed him some money, so he stole a bracer from group loot to pay himself back.  When Kelewala and Wammbamm see Barrelrider later on, they get into an /ooc pissing match with Barrelrider over the theft.  Valric jumped into the middle of the argument and made a total jackass out of himself as usual.<br>
<br>
My favorite passage was this:<br>
<br>

<br>
It's interesting that Valric keeps saying that Wammbamm and Kelewala are the same person when he's getting separate tells from the two of them.  I guess Valric assumes that everyone has multiple identities.<br>
<br>

Shardmoon: yeah, funny stuff, a Kids-Only Rant board sure would be nice. Threads like this are a waste, but the one that really got me was the one warning to look out for an un-named green eyed wood elf warrior because he would date girls in EQ and dump them.... or something... I actually started to try to read and decipher that thread but just gave up.<br>
<br>
Everybody else: what did Valric actually do? I see him referred to as a jerk, dick, etc. by several people, but have yet to see any stories behind it. Met him recently in game and he seems decent enough, and at least his posts here are written well enough, if often annoying (but many people fall here). I also see references to &quot;valric v 2.2&quot; or whatever, so I assume I just know the &quot;new&quot; Valric who is trying to clean his old rep. What did he do? Was he a Mistywolf caliber scam artist? Or did he often loot the SBC, lose the random, log with it anyway, then sell in in EC?<br>
<br>
Yes, I'm a little bored at work now.<br>
