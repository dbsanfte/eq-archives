<br>
If they act on it they are free to accept forgiveness as anyone would.  Once again this goes into the discussion on living in sin vs falling into sin.<br>
<br>
Someone who walks by a store and decides to shoplift has fallen into sin.  Someone who leaves their wallet at home and goes to the store expecting to come home with groceries, as they do every Thursday, is living in sin.  The first can be forgiven, the second must repent (change of heart) before forgiveness is granted.<br>
<br>
Your example doesn't invoke sympathy from me because they don't have to act on it.  Certainly I was attracted to women before I was married and if I had acted on my attraction then it would have been sin.<br>
<br>
God's plan was to create a diverse people rather than clones or robots.  He did so.  <br>
<br>
I am curious here, and this is not meant as an insult or as baiting... just a simple question.  I have an opinion and to prove I am not baiting to come back with something I am going to give you my opinion with the question, so here goes.<br>
<br>
Is it okay for a brother and a sister to sleep together, and even get married (barring local legal interference).  Condition is this... they have no plans to reproduce, even use more than one method of birth control (don't want 2 headed babies after all).<br>
<br>
Now here is my opinion, which is obvious but I want to express my opinion/curiousity of how it relates to homosexuality.  Now, both are detestable to God.  They are not part of His plan.  However, to someone who says "is it wrong to love?" is there a difference?  I don't see how there could be.  I know society accepts one more than the other but the argument could be made that both have been practiced through history, and they have. <p><table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" height="1">

<br>
&quot;Your example doesn't invoke sympathy from me because they don't have to act on it. Certainly I was attracted to women before I was married and if I had acted on my attraction then it would have been sin.&quot;<br>
<br>
Straight people<br>
1) It is sinful to steal<br>
1) It is sinful to act before marriage<br>
2) It is not sinful to act after marriage<br>
<br>
Gay People<br>
1) It is sinful to steal<br>
2) It is sinful for gay people to act at any time (on the same sex)<br>
<br>
See, here is the problem I have Cendan.  You are saying it is not sinful for straight people to act on their instinctive feelings that God gave them about love (attracted to the opposite sex), but it is sinful for gay-people ot act on their instinctive feelings that God gave them about love (attracted to the same sex).<br>
<br>
Your example of stealing is not the same, because it is wrong for -everyone- to act on something like stealing.<br>
<br>
Since you do not believe in anything such as evolution, the only way someone would be born with the ability to love someone else in a sexual manner is for God to give that to them. Right?<br>
<br>
So lets say there are 4 people.  1 straight woman, 1 straight man, 2 gay women.<br>
<br>
The two gay women love each other.  They do not, cannot and do not want to love the man in the same way beacuse of how God made them.<br>
<br>
The straight man and straight women love each other because of how God made them.<br>
<br>
All 4 of these people want to act on their love because it is how God made them.<br>
<br>
According to you, it is sinful for the two gay women to act on this love in <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> any circumstance</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, yet it is not-sinful for the man and women to act on this love given they are married.<br>
<br>
It looks like God has made different rules here.  The people he made gay, they are condemned to hell if they act on their love which God bestowed upon them.  Yet he also made people straight, and they are allowed to act on this love after marriage.<br>
<br>
--conclusions below, for ease of reading---<br>
<br>
Cendan, doesn't that sound extremely hyprocritical of God?  According to what you said, God is setting different rules for people here <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> because</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> he has created them differently in the first place.<br>
<br>
To set the same rules on love for people that were made to love completly different wouldn't make any sense would it?<br>
<br>
Why should 1 person be able to act on the love that they were born with, through God, but someone else it is wrong?<br>
<br>
========================<br>
<br>
About the brother and sister.<br>
<br>
An interesting argument.<br>
<br>
We should first define the type of love we are talking about.  People seem to be born with the ability to love (in general) and the ability to love someone in a different, sexual way.<br>
<br>
You love your family and friends in one way, you love your mate in another.<br>
<br>
It makes sense to say, someone was born to love men sexually or someone was born to love women sexually.  But it is not the logical equivilent to say, someone was born to love a family member sexually.<br>
<br>
After saying that, I still don't know how much of an answer I have.  If a brother and sister <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> truely</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> loved each other in the same sexual way we are describing with a mate, and without a doubt felt the same way about the family member as others experience with other people; then I guess I would have to say it is ok.<br>
<br>
The question remains if it is possible for someone to be born like that.  Maybe people are actually born with a gene determining if they love men or women, and part of this gene also includes their blood line, which makes it so they cannot  be born to love a family member in that sexual way.<br>
<br>
Maybe this gene was mutated to allow for gayness.. and also could have mutated in such a way that their bloodline is not an issue when dealing with their sexuality?<br>
<br>
Who knows, I think the genetic argument could be a good one.  It is possible that this brother and sister truely do love each other in a sexual way.  Their parents passed on some defective gene that allowed for them both the ability to sexualy love a family member.<br>
<br>
Sounds a little out there I know, but it is in the same respect fairly likely.<br>
<br>
All in all, I would say <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> most</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> of the &quot;brother-sister&quot; things are infatuation with someone whom you expirmented with sexually at a young age... They conditioned themselves into thinking it was real love, and may not even know the difference between different types of love.<br>
<br>
The difference between gay love and this is, I am willing to bet that almost every single brother-sister marriage or &quot;love&quot; has come out of sexually experiementing with them at a young age causing a fake infatuation.<br>
<br>
When you look at gay people, most of them are not conditioning themselves at a young age by having gay sex and claiming this is the way they are (although I do believe this is a possible reason in some cases why someone thinks they are gay).  Most of them just feel this way, it's the way they are and they have felt it their whole life and never been comfortable with trying to love someone of the opposite sex that way.<br>
<br>
So overall, I think it's very different saying &quot;is it wrong to love?&quot; in these cases, because brother-sister is caused by infatuation when you don't understand feelings yet.  Gay people usually don't discover until later in their life that this is how they are.<br>

Was jsut curious how you viewed it.  I personally think it would be a hard sell to say that Gay love is okay and Incest is wrong in EVERY circumstance.<br>
<br>
I know both are wrong from a biblical stand point, but I meant from a society view, since more often than not "Fair" determines more than "right."<br>
<br>
I know that my example of stealing was a stretch but in reality sin is sin and God does not view them as different.  I have to point out, however, that God does intend people to resist temptation.<br>
<br>
You say it isn't fair for two hetro to be able to act and two homo not to be able to.  God decides what is acceptable and as far as the "fair" standpoint it doesn't really fly.<br>
<br>
God made all humans and expects us to act in part contrary to our nature.  Our conscience and spirit tell us no and our flesh says yes.  Its very biblical to say that the spirit and the flesh are in constant contrast.  So the added temptation to sin with same sex is no different than other temptations that have been placed within others.  Do I think its fair? Nope.  Do I think that changes how it is?  Another.. Nope.<br>
<br>
Trust me, when I get to heaven I have lots of questions to ask God.  I am curious, do you think Christians enjoy telling people they are lost?  Do you think its a big pride thing, that we are elitest?  We don't have to agree with, understand, or like all that God has planned... but we go along or we don't make it to heaven, which we know we will like.<br>
<br>
OKay, another curiousity question.  Thsi just crossed my mind when I was thinking earlier.  Are there any man made objects that make exact coppies of themselves?  No point to this, just a question.<br>
