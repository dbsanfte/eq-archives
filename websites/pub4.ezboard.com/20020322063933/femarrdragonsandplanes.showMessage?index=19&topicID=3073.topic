Most folks that don't have to use gems to buff, they use their cash to upgrade gear or to buy spells, etc....In other words, they usually make a profit.  That doesn't mean they are greedy loot whores, it's just part of the game.  Gotta make money somwhere, right?<br>
<br>
The cleric, however, has to make a certain amount of cash just to keep the group alive.  Those peridots cost money.  If the cleric isn't taken care of, you don't get your buffs.  So after the cleric's costs are taken care of...don't they deserve to make some profit, as well?  They need to buy spells and upgrade gear, too. <br>
<br>
What it boils down to is this.  I want the cleric's cost covered so my ass can be covered in buffs.  Everyone in the group needs to make a profit.  The cleric isn't greedy....they just have to fork out a whole lot of pp to keep us healthy.  <br>
<br>
One last note....If you have never organized one, ask someone what the cost is for one Hate raid.  It's ugly, I tell you, just plain ugly.  <br>

<br>
One school says that OS is a chance to restock.  That is the reason I never felt guilty when I took all the gems when offered.<br>
<br>
One school says that it is not their responsibility to restock clerics for losses at other camps.  That is the reason I never complained when they just wanted a 6 way split.<br>
<br>
You better not, however, complain in OS and insist on 6 way split and then complain in KC, HS, etc when I don't symbol you cause I am low on funds.  It can not work both ways.<br>
<br>
By the way... I love... absolutely love when I res someone for free and they donate a stack or a half stack of peridot.  It tells me my time and mana are worth something, without me feeling like I am doing it for the money, and at the same time allows me to continue doing my job at less loss to myself. <p><table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" height="1">

Then the items such as quest gems and spells go to those who need them.  After wards the rest is just gone down the list and given an equal amount of the loot spell wise and quest gem wise that wasn't claimed as needed.  Greedy players just irritate me.  Especially when it's a cleric saying they are getting shafted when they know good and well they are getting compensated.  Perfect example of the need before greed was a group i was in had me(druid), 2 warriors, wizzie, chanter, and monk.  Pair of warrior gaunts dropped( I Believe they go for around 3 or 4k)  both warriors claimed they needed them and would use them, but also the wizzie wanted it for his twink.  Needless to say the wizzie ran off crying cause of his greedy nature and has a personal mark with me to where i will not be in a group with him now even if it means I leave the group.  Just my opinion of whats right and wrong.  Some of us would just rather see everything equally done and help those who could use them then used for greedy purposes. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uzoldarf.showPublicProfile?language=EN>zoldarf</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 87<br> <font color=#E9D756>(2/20/02 1:09:08 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3073.topic&index=22>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: How much compensation do clerics require?</span><hr size=1> Some clerics buff too much.

<br>
56 levels of a cleric that DOES get compensated for DOTs = Me<br>
<br>
Once a week I buy 1200pp on Dots.<br>
<br>
Me = Broke most of the time.<br>
<br>
OS is the one of the BEST place for gems.  However, Cleric loot items ( Kunark Cleric Armor? LOL ) are at at much lower ratio than others.  When I go there, what loot am I seeking?  Nada.  Im there to get exp and have fun.  Many melee will move that rbg or css, etc to a twink before spending a weekend in OS.  OS is NBG, as it should be.  But greedy liers abound !  You all know who you are or of someone whom you saw the next day /auct that in EC ...<br>
<br>
MANY places I CANNOT be compensated by loot.  There just isn't any ( HS, Most outdoor zones, SS, Kael, etc ).<br>
<br>
So SOMEHOW, at the end of the week, being compensated fairly ( sometimes overcompensated, sometimes undercompensated ) I have barely enough cash to get the gems I need for the following week.<br>
<br>
Clerics are generally not greedy.  Its not in the nature of someone who has sat and healed someone for 50+ levels, of which 45 levels you get NO compensation, to really care much.<br>
<br>
The fact is, I KNOW the people who are speed looters and loot whores ( yes, you bastages whom say you need something you don't! ).  I avoid them at all cost.  Wich means I can't do pickup groups in OS.  Damn near every group has a greedy player I knew from the past.<br>
<br>
Now the upside is that after 49+ levels, people WANT their cleric to be well equiped, not die, and have plenty of cash for DOTs to keep their dumb asses alive.  So usually Clerics get Money and DOTs from their guilds and friends.  <br>
<br>
And I SWEAR, no druids should even touch the topic of greed ....<br>
<br>
FYI:  I will stay 12 hours in OS and cast Symbol the whole time with no compensation.  I won't even be upset.  However, don't expect me to join your group again.  Furthurmore, its only when Im glutton for punishment that I will grab a pickup group in OS.  At least I know my guildies are not greedy loot whores out to scam their way into loot they do not need.<br>

Even if you had a few deaths, there is no way that the cleric used more than a stack of periodots casting Aego over a four hour period.  I'm guessing that your cleric walked away with several hundred plat in gems above and beyond periodot costs.<br>
<br>
This is a touchy issue that has been on this board many times.  Unfortunately, there are some clerics who make a lot of money on gems and who feel that it is an entitlement.  On the other hand, there are a lot of people who will undercompensate the cleric.  The person who said to just give the cleric the first two or three gems is one of those people.  Depending on the value of the gems, the number of dispels/deaths, and the type of spell being using (Naltron, Marzin, or Aegolism), that could cover the cleric's costs for less than an hour.<br>
<br>
Back when I was in a lot of pickup groups, I was usually the master looter.  I used to shock people by passing out a lot of extra gems in a zone like OS.  A fair number of people would refuse to take them from me, saying that I lost money in other zones.  They were right.  I sometimes took big losses in zones like KC, Chardok, and The Hole, not to mention pickup raids to places like Sky and Fear.  Over time, it probably evened out.<br>
<br>
I've never been obsessed with money.  I never ask for more gems than is necessary to cover my costs, I try to make sure that some of the gems get to the enchanter if Rune is being used, and I never accept payment for a rez.  However, I know that a lot of clerics have a different perspective, and I can't say that they're unjustified.  Clerics <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> do</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> get screwed on periodot costs a lot.  There just isn't an easy answer to this issue, other than simply avoiding pickup groups. <p>Sagemon Prayeth<BR>

In the end, I hadn't expected serious money from gem drops; the cleric was laffin', he knew I was takin' the hit in loot hard, and I had just bought a packload of Tunare sandwiches and SpringWater: now he didn't want any loot except dem gems. Wow! Generous fella must have amassed a fortune in gems, getting magnanimous already.

What the hell does the rogue need a symbol for if he aint pullin? He's got evade. And if he sucks at evade, an extra 300hps aint gonna save his arse anyway. Same with secondary tanks. &lt;shrugs&gt;Once I realized I was getting severely undercompensated in most pickup groups, I stopped symboling every person in the group. Did I request more gems? Nope, didn't see it as helping the situation, nor did I feel like dealing the possible barrage of &quot;loot whore&quot; comments.<br>
<br>
Puller, and any pure caster , and usually the shaman if they're there for slowing, get symboled. And those symbols get refreshed instantly when it drops and they request it. I don't even symbol myself. I'd like to think I'm a good cleric, I do more than my fair share and people typically don't die with me around. Believe it or not, people generally understand why you don't symbol a secondary tank, or anyone else who never seems to get hit. Of course things will change when I get group aego in oh, 2 gold. <br>
<br>
Anyway, I'm rambling. Since I dropped the majority of the pickup groups I join, I'm coming out ahead, and having to turn down gems. I spend approx 450-500pp on 40gems, being a dorf with god awful cha. I take what I need to compensate, with a little extra for doing a damn good job, and push the rest onto the group. Simple as that.<br>

Those who over compensate their clerics and 2.  Those who dont compensate at all.<br>
<br>
I find myself in the position where I am offered to much cash loot and I respond by saying that the dots have been covered and that if the group continues on for some time I'll speak up when I feel that another item might be necessary.<br>
<br>
One thing I know is that there is a big difference in cash loot for different zones/camps.  In Velks I find that there are often no cash loot drops unless you're at a good camp spot.  In this circumstance I'll often cast Pinzarn on everyone but the main tanks (Pinzarn uses jaspers instead of peridots if ya dont know) so it still costs but its not as much of a loss.  Perhaps some will argue that this is innapropriate but I have yet to have anyone complain.<br>
<br>
As a cleric I also know what a profit can be made by stopping for a few moments (inbetween groups) to res people making donations... this helps cover the expenses of groups that DONT contribute or cant contribute as much as it costs.  If Im in a group in such a zone as KC and I get a tell saying "hey can you res me, I'll donate" generally I try to say "no sorry I have to reserve my mana for heals" ~ if group hasnt been able to compensate for costs occasionally I'll say "sure might be a minute I'll need to make sure I have the mana" and then inform the group "hey going to res this guy to help cover dot costs" ~ normally its not a problem.  God knows how much clerics can make taking the time to res someone.  Nothing imho is smarter than taking time to res and accepting the donations to help cover the expense of being a cleric.  <br>
<br>
It seems unfair to me at times for group members to have to sacrifice so much for clerics who seek more compensation than they need when they are, in fact, not the only ones who have costs.  (tanks with shrink potions for some zones, chanters with dots, wizards with TL componants, arrows for the puller, etc... yeah some are minor but they are there)<br>
<br>
When Im not playing a cleric I tend to have dots handy... usually for paying for res's because as a cleric I love being payed with dots for res's and I know others do too.  And sometimes in groups I find that others usually keep dots handy... and many will see that no cash loot is being given and they'll hand me 2-3 dots for the symbols I've casted on them... its something that always impresses me.<br>
<br>
One thing I do see a lot of, which disappoints me, are clerics who dont have dots.  I never carry less than 8 stacks of peridots and 5 stacks of jaspers.  When a group doesnt compensate or if the drops arent plentiful its just something you have to eat up.  There's no reason for a cleric NOT to dot their group, if the group is shitty about costs or is just downright neglectful, find another group or speak up and say "hey dots cost X amount, anyone mind if I get a few of the cash drops to compensate" ~ they wont say no.<br>
<br>
Another thing is that if a cleric says "dots cost so much bla bla bla" it sometimes makes me a bit bitter when they overprice them... there is no reason why a cleric cant invest in a few + cha items allowing them to buy dots at a somewhat reasonable price.  I never pay more than 10.5 pp per dot... there's no reason to.  I just switch my +cha gear when Im buying/selling and then carry on.  No cleric should say they cost much more than that imho.<br>
<br>
Anyway... those are my thoughts.<br>

I have absolutly no problem with giving the first 3 to 5 cash loots to the cleric (this very easily can add up to 500pp). Spell drops in Necro are for the most part not needed by people in group for thier mains (at least in the groups ive been in at necro). So I pass them out much like cash loots (many of those spells can be turned into a NPC in FV and can then be sold for up to 500pp, and many can be sold to merchants for up to 30pp each, that can add up fast). I always do an even split of cash all the way down to silver. Clerics should be paid, but I personally don't think they should get all the gems. Why would I be there beside xp, unless I had the chance to get gems.<br>
<br>
I realize it does not cost me plat to camp in any dungeon, but if people didn't get treasure, they wouldn't bother going to places like that.<br>
<br>
These are never easy subjects, cause everyone wants something. It can easily degenerate into nothing but a fight.<br>
<br>
I have seen some clerics insist on all the cash loot gems, and in one instance it would have added up to well over 2k.<br>

<br>
That can also be as little as 120 pp.  120 pp = less than 10 periodots = not enough to keep Symbol of Naltron or Marzin up for more than an hour.  Unless you're an expert on the value of cash loot gems, you're probably one of the people who screw over clerics, even though you didn't realize it.<br>
<br>

<br>
As far as I'm concerned, the value of a spell drop is what a vendor will pay for it, which is about 10 to 15 pp on average.  I don't hang out in EC auctioning spells, and I've never seen a merchant pay 30 pp for any sub-55 spell.  If I've used a full stack of periodots, it would take about 20 drops spells to compensate me.  If you tried to tell me that the spells are worth more than that, I'd tell you to kiss my ass.<br>
<br>
There are people who make money selling the sub-55 spells, but it requires an investment of time that I don't choose to make.  When I wind up with extra spells, they either get sold to the first merchant I see or dumped into my guild's spell bank.<br>
<br>
As a couple other people have commented, Symbol probably gets cast too much in experience groups.  Not everyone really needs it.  You need it on the main tank, the enchanter, and the shaman/necro if they're converting HPs to mana.  For everyone else, it's a luxury, albeit a useful luxury.  If you don't want Symbol, just speak up. <p>Sagemon Prayeth<BR>

They get compensated with things that drop in the zone typically -- although in zones like Akheva Ruins, one place I love to frequent, I don't have a problem paying the cleric since there isn't much if anything dropping to compensate them with -- so I shouldn't have to pay them for it.  ESPECIALLY if I'm the one doing crowd control, or pulling.<br>
<br>
Not many things bug me more than an inefficient cleric.  If I'm pulling, I'm taking harmtouches for ~6-700 damage, being beat on for 80-150 damage a pop while running back, and have to take a beating for 3-5 seconds while the main tank gets aggro off me.  Best case scenario in a place like chardok, I'll take 6-800 damage per pull.  In a bad case I'll take as much as 12-1300 damage, worste case sometimes as much as 1800 damage.  So what makes the most sense?  Why, remedy or divine light of course!  Don't symbol the puller so you can complete heal them, that doesn't make sense ;p<br>

<br>
I've also noticed that Sage, the shaman gets a marzin or aego if he's slowing, otherwise I'll prolly jus toss a naltron on them for canni purposes. Same goes with necro's for liching. Seems easier to me to simply drop a couple hundred more hps on them, as opposed to constantly casting heal on them to cover lich dmg. Granted both classes have their own heals: necro-tap, shaman-torpor, and both are very good...but low hps=aggro, and if necro's wait till they're extremely low to tap, chances are they're gonna get aggro'd before they get a chance to fire it. And Torpor is an hot, which means it takes time to take effect. if the shammy is busy tryin to cast torpor on an inc call, as opposed to slow first, chances there they get aggro'd as well. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showMessageRange?topicID=3073.topic&start=21&stop=22>2</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showPrevMessage?topicID=3073.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showNextMessage?topicID=3073.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3073.topic&index=70><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/gfx/addReply1.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.emailToFriend?topicID=3073.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.threadControl?topicID=3073.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/deleteThreadFire.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=3073.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=3073.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub4.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="emarrmessageboardrules">Message Board Rules<option value="emarrlinks">Links<option value="emarrupcomingmmorpgs">Upcoming MMOG's<option value="emarrfrm18">America Under Attack<option value="emarrfrm19">Dark Age of Camelot<option value="emarrgeneral">General<option value="emarrfrm17">Funny Stuff<option value="emarrbazaar">Item Bazaar<option value="emarrscrollsnspells">Spell Bazaar<option value="emarrfrm15">Shiny Things<option value="emarrfrm14">Bargain Basement<option value="emarrdragonsandplanes">Rants and Flames<option value="emarrfrm13">Dragons and Planes<option value="emarrroleplaying">Roleplaying<option value="emarrroleplayingoocforum">Roleplaying - OOC Forum<option value="emarrscammeralert">Scammer Alert<option value="emarrsignaturecorner">Test Forum<option value="emarrreallife">Real Life<option value="emarrothermmorpgs">Other MMOG's</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#E9D756>- </font><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/bemarr>Erollisi Marr, The Queen of Love</a><font color=#E9D756> - </font><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes>Rants and Flames</a> <font color=#E9D756> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><form method="post" action="http://affiliates.allposters.com/link/redirect.asp" target="_top">
