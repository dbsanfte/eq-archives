You are the kind of folks who make this game enjoyable.<br>
<br>
Second:  I don't think that the majority of the folks on this thread have any right to criticize anyone else's social skills.  The put-down's and insults tossed out in the very beginning at Veeta, and later at some of the more tolerant voices, demonstrate perfectly the cliche, &quot;the pot calling the kettle black.&quot;  <br>
<br>
Third:  I cannot believe that folks are making a big deal over the possibility that the female character, Veeta, is being played by a &quot;he,&quot; when half of the female characters in this game are being played by guys (and many won't admit it) - so what?  They have wisely figured out that higher-level males are more likely to pass on unsolicited help and equipment to lower-level female characters...DUH!  (&quot;I love being a girl...&quot;)<br>
<br>
Fourth:  Everyone seems to be sharing analogies, let me share mine - a family says they are the victims of a house fire and have lost a great deal, so they appeal for help.  I give them some nice clothes and other items that I decide to donate rather than resell.  A week later, I run into this same family selling those same items I donated for the cash, while sporting a brand new, more expensive wardrobe.  <br>
<br>
Do I have the right to be outraged?  NO!  Why?<br>
<br>
1)  I do not know the circumstances nor do I know how many other folks may have responded to their plea - folks who may have donated wayyyy better stuff than mine.<br>
<br>
2)   I gave them a gift - period.  I do not get to decide how a gift is used or not used.  If I have attached agendas and expectations to a gift, it is no longer a gift.  It is the same thing with lending, I must do so with the mind set that I may never see the money/item again.  That way, if dire circumstances come up or if I am duped, I can write it off as an opportunity to demonstrate kindness to another who may have needed that example.  If I cannot achieve that mind set, I either cannot afford the loss or have no business lending.  If I do anyway and I am hurt, it is my own fault.<br>
<br>
Along the same vein...<br>
<br>
I must only give away something which is comfortable for me.  For example:  If I give money to a street drunk, he would probably spend his &quot;begging money&quot; on alcohol.  DUH!  As a long-time recovering alcoholic, I know that many street people are chronic alcoholics so that is not comfortable.  My solution: If they ask for my help, I offer them help they may need but may be different than what they have asked.  Instead of giving money, I will offer to take them to a nearby store and buy them $20.00 worth of food, gloves, etc... Those who need it take me up on it and thank me.  Those who do not go on their way.<br>
<br>
Regarding EQ, I will admit that I am NOT comfortable just handing out plat to folks who beg for it.  However, I will tell newbies the ways in which they can earn my pp.  As a master baker, I always need foraged and looted items and I pay well for them. If they choose to beg instead, they can beg from someone else with no rancor from me.  Veeta has never asked me for equipment, money or any other kind of &quot;hand-out&quot; through any of our interactions on EQ.  Quite the contrary, she approached me selling batwings.  When she discovered that I was a Druid who needed them for both lev and baking, she wisely put me on a &quot;client list&quot; and contacted me regularly when she had a good supply.  Quite enterprising, in my opinion, and demonstrated a high level of initiative.<br>
<br>
Finally, I found the outrage expressed on this topic fascinating.  Why?  Because no one here was really harmed in any of this...no one was &quot;trained&quot; in EC...no one was emotionally abused (other than Veeta and those who even hinted at supporting her, even before there was any mention of alleged &quot;evidence&quot;)...no one was cheated in a trade or sale...even if all of the negative stuff is really true.  So, why all of this anger?<br>
<br>
I think that some potential real-life issues may give Veeta a knack for pushing buttons, probably unintentionally.  However, I think the reaction says more about the folks holding the resentment than it does about the target of their anger.  It's easy to treat those people who are popular and likable with kindness and respect.  The true reflection of character is how one treats those who are unpopular and/or more difficult to understand.<br>

Ok.. I have read and re read this post since it was started... I am probably the last person you would find here defending Veeta. I for one am not his/her biggest fan. (this is from in game issues that have nothing to do with this type of thing), and Calibriede has hit the nail squarely.<br>
<br>
In game I could not figure out why Veeta irritated me so much. He never begged from me. He never &quot;expected&quot; me to do anything for him, but from the get go he irritated me. Now I realize it was because of his &quot;manner&quot;, the way he presents himself, and his inability to take advice without getting defensive. But this is not the topic.. on to the topic at hand.<br>
<br>
My opinion is slightly tainted with my annoyance with Veeta but I am going to try my best to be objective.<br>
<br>
I don't believe Veeta was scamming.. I have seen the evidence and most of it is rather circumstantial and could be interpreted in several ways. <br>
<br>
1 He said he didn't care about his body rotting... <br>
<br>
On occasion, when I have had something happen and am very frustrated about it. I have gotten upset and said awe fuck it I don't care about it anyway.. Even if I did really care.. Look at it this way.. You've lost your body (it happens).. you're new to a guild... Do you really want to seem like a annoyance and keep them looking (although it was probably more annoying to tell them he didn't care, he made a lousy choice).. I will tell you that I know that he kept looking for his own corpse long after he told the guildie not to worry about it.<br>
<br>
2 how could he have nothing if his inventory was full and who was the transfer for anyway?.. <br>
<br>
He had transferred his warrior equipment to an alt for a bit, so that alt would have some armor, and played the alt.Then decided to play his warrior again and was transferring the equipment back. In his inventory was most likely what we all carry.. Backpacks full of food, water and supplies (I know I carry alot of shit besides my armor don't you) when the original transfer to the alt was done.. He most likely did not bag it just transferred over and put it on..<br>
<br>
Was he an idiot for not checking to make sure he had room.. HELL YES... <br>
<br>
3 When jeka gave him the equipment he told Jeka he was going to sell it to get better equipment.. and he was told he didn't have to return the equipment.. before he was given equipment by some here, was he in cloth with a rusty?.. welp... yup he was.. I saw him... for 2 days until he was given some help here...<br>
<br>
Like I said.. while I consider Veeta an annoying little shit.. I do not believe he was scamming.. His bad grammar and spelling makes him come off that way. (Veeta there are free downloads on the Internet to help with that.. Use them)...<br>
<br>
Will I give him anything? Hell no.. not because I think he is scamming.. only because I don't like him but that is my choice.. If Venen wants to help that his his choice (or is it her..)<br>
<br>
one last statement then I am done.. I saw some of you flame people on this topic because they don't post here and you called them Noobes...<br>
I have played this game for well into 2 years now and this is my first post on this board. Does that make me a newbie.. no... Just because someone doesn't post here does not mean they are new.. I have also seen someone comment on Level. Just because someone is not 60 does not mean they are new either.. after 2 years I am level 41..Why because I quest and help people and tradeskill and chat and just plain enjoy the game. ok all I am done.. see you in game <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

<br>
I also think that the reasons much of this was given to me/us were a)  We never did ask for anything and b)  We are nice to people.  When I do run into beggars in the game, I tell them that the need to take the initiative to make their own money and just be really nice to folks in the game.  That will be the best incentive for folks to give them things.  Also, be nice to EVERYONE, not just higher-level folks.  You never know whose alt you may be addressing!  &lt;grin&gt;<br>

Just gotta catch me when I am bored I guess. <p><center><img src="http://www.danos.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/jellah.gif" width="577" height="162"></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uvenen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Venen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Boardaholic</span><br> <font color=#000033>(2/18/02 8:16:12 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumrantsandravesbalancingissues.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1664.topic&index=213>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.crocker.com/~denise/amflag.gif  WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: somoene stole my $hiot</span><hr size=1> The job of the strong is to help the weak. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ufran9876.showPublicProfile?language=EN>fran9876</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>w4nn4b3!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(2/18/02 9:22:02 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumrantsandravesbalancingissues.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1664.topic&index=214>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: somoene stole my $hiot</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> The job of the strong is to help the weak.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

That just encourages more people to be weak and lazy.  The REAL job of the strong is to encourage and teach the weak to learn to be self suficient. <p><center><a href="http://www.guildmagic.com/character.cfm?ID=33587"><IMG SRC="http://members.home.net/fran98765/tinile.jpg"></a><br>

<br>
1)  As far as noobs just getting in the game:  I do encourage self-sufficiency by paying high prices for farmed/foraged items.  Jellah has his own slightly-sick-but-entertaining way of passing on money &lt;grin&gt;.  Others will pass on plat or equipment for favors, etc...  All of these are ways to help noobs get ahead a little without just giving them everything outright.   <br>
<br>
2)  Veeta, as I know her, is a different matter.  She proved herself to me as a very self-sufficient and enterprising individual.  For her to have an unfortunate loss like that in the game is difficult, and I don't blame her for asking around.  People had the choice whether or not to give, but should have done without expectations or strings.  That way, no one would be disappointed. <br>

<br>
I think many people here are willing to help people.  Jeka and others did.  He did so without expectations or strings.  I believe people were upset that Veeta was caught in lies.<br>
<br>
Yes she proved her self to be a "self-sufficient and enterprising individual." Most politicians are as well.  Lies and deception work.  She was caught, and apologized for it.<br>
<br>
She was helped on a few occasions that were documented here.  When she lost a corpse of items she seemed rather apathetic, knowing there someone else would help re-equip her.  And, for a time this was true.  I think now, it was abused and it will not happen again.<br>
<br>
She should work on making a new name for herself.  <br>
