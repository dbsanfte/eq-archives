Being a leader has very little to do with intelligence.  A good leader is a good listener and not some schmo who thinks he has all the answers.  Societies impression of intelligence is way over-rated.  Look in some history books to see what 'smart' people have done when given power.  Even complicated decisions boil down to (usually) two different options.  The answers are usually right vs. wrong.  It doesn't take a genius to make the right decision, it takes wisdom.  In my opinion, everyone is a genius in their own right.  It just so happens that society puts a certain status on intelligence and athleticism as more important than other abilities.  For example, what makes the best ping-pong player in the world less athletic than michael jordan?  His status.  Not trying to flame anyone here, I agree, he is not the best speaker we have seen in the white house.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/urittdabard.showPublicProfile?language=EN>rittdabard</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 22<br> <font color=#E9D756>(3/1/02 6:50:30 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=279.topic&index=23>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Politics of war</span><hr size=1> Actually, I was just poking some light hearted fun at him.

<br>
Intelligence is not over rated I just think many people's intelligence is over-rated.  I'd disagree with you on about your entire post brutas.  Even simple decisions usually have an almost infinite number of options not just two, let alone complex decisions.  A good leader is one who makes us belive there are only two and he is for the &quot;good&quot; one and his opponents support the &quot;wrong&quot; one. That is how our system has survived despite all its flaws. The democrats and republicans pick certain issues to focus on and they draw our attention to them and try to point out the othersides flaws. This also helps them to avoid certain touchy subjects. Every election a third party or also-ran Dem/Rep candidate somewhere pops up and mentions campaign finance reform and both sides take up the issue only to drop it after election. I think one of the flaws in America is our inability to ask for other options than just the two sides. <br>
<br>
As for the ping-pong player, well that analogy reminded me of the scene in Kingpin when Woody Harrelson escorts his Amish protege into the national bowling tournament and the Amish guy looks on at a bunch of bald, fat, beer-guzzling men and says &quot;Look at 'em. Those are some of the finest athletes in the world.&quot; I think that athletecism like intelligence to some degree is about perspective. I bet some Chinese people might think the ping-pong champ was more athletic than Jordan. (Assuming the best ping pong player is Chinese).<br>

Quote Brutas:<br>
Even complicated decisions boil down to (usually) two different options.<br>
 I understand your point about a decision having many different options, but I think &quot;boil down to&quot; express that ultimately we arrive at either yea or nea.  &quot;usually&quot;  Of course we must first sift through the sand to find what we are looking for.  <br>
<br>
 Quote Ritt:<br>
Intelligence is not over rated I just think many people's intelligence is over-rated.<br>
<br>
  So when making decisions, intelligence is the key role for finding the correct antecdote for solving the problem?  Hmm, I'm not saying intelligence isn't important in making decisions, but I do believe that wisdom is more important.  If intelligence is the over-riding factor then what are so many people of lesser intelligence doing here?  For an example I will use an intelligence scale form 1-10.  (I don't prefer IQ test as determining Intelligence)  Ok so do you thin the person with a 9 for an intelligence will have a better chance of survival in an armed conflict than the person with a 5?  During combat don't think that the 'smart' officer is going to make all the decisions.  I imagine you wil probably say, &quot;No, the better Trained person will survive.&quot;  Then I ask you, does training depend on a persons intelligence?  I think you can see where I'm going with this.  Intelligence is important but so many people in our society are shuned as not important because they don't have the 'credentials' as others might have.  The credentials of 'intelligence' like a degree of some sort.  Dumb people have ben surviving since the dawn of humankind.  Take Trech for example <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   JUST KIDDING TRECH <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Quote Ritt:<br>
  A good leader is one who makes us belive there are only two and he is for the &quot;good&quot; one and his opponents support the &quot;wrong&quot; one.<br>
<br>
  No that is a politician with alterior motives.  A good leader does not attempt to trick his followers.  Unless he knows it is within their ideals of the moral good.  The politician on the other hand, might attempt to trick his followers for HIS own good.  Take Machiavelli for example.  What you are descibing is a good Manipulator.<br>
<br>
Quote Ritt:<br>
That is how our system has survived despite all its flaws.<br>
<br>
I agree with you to a certain extent.  When it comes to a system which involves humans, choice is put into the equation.  THE biggest variable that we know of.  So the ping-pong effect as you describe is a game played by politicians which is eventually won by the person who 'Looks' like they won.  Very true.  Sad to say, but true.  Yep at first you might have several isues but eventually it comes down to Either/Or, Yea or Nea, Democrat/Republican.  So your words prove my point.  <br>
<br>
  The main point I was trying to make is that peoples perceptions are, for the most part, pretty sad.  But you can't expect Michael Jordan to beat that Chinese ping-pong player no more than the ping-pong player beating Jordan at his game.  Hence everybody has their special place no matter how their abilities, athleticism or intelligence is percieved by society.  The elderly are a great example of this.  Society treats them as if they are worthless because of their lacking condition of health.  Elderly people ALWAYS have something important to say.  But we tend to ignore them because of their status.

President Kim Jong II. This stuff about saving the peasants is kinda a load of crap don't you think? The U.S. has shown no interest in South American dictators or African militants unless there is an interest at stake. In fact we have overthrown democratically elected leaders in South America and instituted facist military regimes that promised to better protect our capitalist interests. <br>
<br>
We always used to use those words, (petty, cruel, despotic, probably insane, pathetic excuses for leader) to describe Castro. Is he less a threat now? Castro would almost look like a saint when you stand him next to the guy the U.S. tried to empower there. Fact is people like Escobar, Somoza, Lumumba, Sukarno, Arbenz, Mossadegh, Sihanouk were good leaders with flaws, like all humans, that the U.S. overexaggerated to use as excuses to oust them and put in leaders who would support our strip mining of thier countries in exchange for weapons. I have nothing wrong with pointing out the short comings of leaders, in fact I think it is a citizens duty to keep the world leaders on their toes, but when any criticism that even remotely equals the @#%$ we've slung about Castro or the Arabs is said about our leaders out come the &quot;love it or leave it crowd&quot; to @#%$ all over Jefferson's ideals of how a nation should be run. <br>
<br>
Remember America's original motto? You know the flag with the snake.  &quot;Don't tread on me.&quot; That is the way America should and can be run. We should not be a pre-emptive attacker. They want a war, bring it to us and we will level them. No nation on this planet posesses the ability to wipe us off the planet, despite what many doom-prophets may cry,  save oursleves. China or Russia may but their leaders have the common sense the third world leaders do not and will not initiate a war for fear of global retribution. Perhaps we will realize the world doesn't much like our war-mongering either before the world decides to act. I don't think the collective nations of this planet give a @#%$ about U.S. popular opinion at election time when they see the havoc some of our haphazard foriegn policy has wrought. <br>

  Pretty soon, we will learn to work for justice world-wide and not just declare war only to create a moral reason for such an act.  I can understand some reaosn behind what we do.  Basically, if there is no possibility of an economic payoff, we don't get involved.  When we do get involved, we destroy our economy to a certain degree.  If we did that once for all of the worlds problems, we would destroy ourselves.  So who the heck knows.  We do some good things and do some bad.

I want to point something else out. OK get ready...Hitler was a genius. Did anyone reading that have an angry knee-jerk reaction. I know when I have said that before I have been nearly killed. Do not get me wrong I don't agree with much of Hitler's idealology, but he was an incredibly effective and progressive leader. Hitler pumped a lot of money into science and technology. That stuff is not told to us though. We are only told about the evils of his reign. <br>
<br>
I see America gradually becoming the Germany that impowered Hitler. We are becoming more and more nationalistic, and showing less respect for other nations. We are becoming more willing to set aside ethics in order to promote our own industry. We have shown no hesitation in protecting American businesses' interests overseas. We seem to take less and less personal responsibility for our own shortcomings. These are the traits that lead to Germany's fanatical devotion to Hitler. Adolph Hitler didn't create those traits in his people, he harnassed those characteristics to get the full support of the German people. I am very afraid that this is the only side of America that other countries are seeing. <br>

There are similarities that can be drawn.  About American business, I find is disappointing that we don't know the impacts it is having.  Alot of it has to do with cultural diffussion that naturally takes place in a capitalist society.  It causes much heartache for all countries who travel through the transition.  Much of this is why Bin Laden can find supporters so easily.  IMO we force it too much on other countries, whereas we should use an implosive strategy rather than an explosive one.  Through the transition the Middle Eastern countries face, political systems would collapse or come close to it if we weren't so economically aggressive.  Being this way allows them to direct their frustrations against us in a nationalistic manner.  Just as 9/11 did for us.  <br>
<br>
Hitler was a genius,  though I believe everyone is a genius in their own right, Hitler used passionate speech to rally a hurting people who were no more guilty of anything wrong than England, France or Russia.  Germany definetly got the shaft in WW I.  Supossedly, much of America's involvement was due to Zionist politicians who brought us in WW I to help England who in turn made a deal with the Zionist Jews to carve out a Jewish territory(Israel).  In fact as far as I know, there were just as many Americans searching to help Germany in WW I as there were England.  Or almost as many.  <br>
<br>
I don't see us becoming as nationalistic as Hitlers Germany because we have a two party system that will always find fault with each other.  But I think your point is interesting because of the correlation of our policies having so much to do with Israel. The more and more that happens, the more I see our government becoming corrupt.  Our politicians are sellouts to whoever can offer them the most money.  There is some genuine  policy making but the majority of it is geared to appease not the voters, but the people who contribute monetarily. Today's society scoffs at the idea of conspiricy because the media has gradually exposed the 'nutballs' who attempt as shedding light on some of these inportant issues.  In todays world, you have to have a picture, video tape or recording of something to prove it orelse you are deemed as 'weak-minded' or downright crazy.  <br>
<br>
Why isn't anyone asking Why did our security agenices have notice of suspicious trvallers and do nothing about it?  Why did the large majority of Jewish workers at the trade center get a phone call not to go to work that same morning?  How did Israeli security agencies know as much or more than our security agencies?  Why didn't non-Jewish workers get a phone call?  Why is this not a topic for the media to cover?
