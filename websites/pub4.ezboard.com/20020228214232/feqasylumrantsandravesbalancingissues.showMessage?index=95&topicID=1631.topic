My group was fighting down into chardok via the door/observer route to see what we could camp when we came upon the BK camp, things looked good, nobody there, nobody claimin it anymore in camp checks.  Looked fine, we moved in, killed the BK and surrounding mobs.   We knew there had been a group calling that camp earlier, but after another camp check and nobody calling it we assumed they ported out.   <br>
<br>
Then I get a nasty tell from a rogue in your group about how I am a KSing whore or some shit.  I'm like &quot;what?&quot;  Turns out the group camping the BK (your group) was all dead down the hall and we never even saw their little bodies cause we didn't pull from their camp site.  My group didn't contain a cleric (or chanter for that matter), but I offered to pull their bodies to zone for them.  I volunteered my group to fight to zone with their dead bodies but they were just too upset about us taking their camp and refused help.  It was really outta proportion, since we never had any verbal contact with them before the hate tells started.  I'm sorry Jellah that you felt wronged, that was not my intention.  We offered to leave if your group was coming back, but half your group camped for the night at that point after getting their bodies rezzed.  I really didn't understand it.  I even offered the rogue who was so outspoken a spot in the group at the BK, but he refused.  Sometimes it's just impossible to make people happy.  I don't actually remember talking to Jellah at all in fact, which is probably why she hated me so much.  She never asked what I was doing, or even deigned to talk with me.  Want childish?  That's childish. <br>
<br>
I've rescued groups from wipeouts in chardok a lot.  it's my favorite zone for hunting and I know it well.  When people die or wipe out at the BK camp i'm usually campin observer and we clear on down there to drag and rez em.  I get thanks usually for helpin, but sometimes people are just rude.  <br>
<br>
Figures, the one time I had a misunderstanding, someone would bring it up and say &quot;see?  He's an undesirable anyway.&quot;  <br>
<br>
Thanks Jellah.  You don't play anymore eh?  I'm sure it was all my fault.  Lanys lost another stellar chanter who couldn't control a camp and got her group wiped out.  Gimme a break, that accusation is as bogus as the one you leveled at me, so get off yer high horse and kindly haunt some other board if yer not gonna even play.  <br>
<br>
Some of the others who posted stuff that they dont like me, well, I don't remember them at all.  I have no idea what they got upset about, and frankly I don't care cause I don't know them. <br>
<br>
I'm generally nice to friends, groupies, and noobs, but I have been known to call people noobs for messing up.  /shrug. It's just a favorite word of mine i guess.  I wish people would stop takin such offense, since I call myself a noob when I mess up.  <br>
<br>
Thanks but I wasn't the one at fault with the Verix incident.  My group had some bad luck and wiped, FL steamrolled us.  Those are the facts.  <br>
<br>
Not like it matters, my friends got me a MQ of Verix later that night.  I'll go to VP with my friends and guildies.  I dont have shit to prove to the rest of you.  <br>

find a newbie that wants a bind in Greater Fay and cast lev on him, have him jump off the one of the platforms and bind him in mid air. Then dispell him and let him enter a death loop. <br>

Wish I could find the original post that he stated all this but I'm on my lunch break and didn't have alot of time to find it. I remember it well because I was embarassed that someone like him was on the same server as myself and he was a fellow shaman too :( <p>Bukar Tigerclaw<BR>

That wasnt the case with Chardok incident.  Jellah's group had some bad luck and whiped, Land steamrolled them.  Those are the facts.<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
Wow makes you wonder, right?  Only different between 2 incidents is that you word them differently trying to make yourself look better, and the other party worse.  You say Jellah was sending you nasty tells? Oh I doubt your shouts to zone about FL being KSers were much nicer.<br>

I remember the incident very well as i havent played much since then and im not sure if i can agree with Landragoran. <br>
<br>
I know myself pretty well and i doubt i started my conversation with him in a rude manner. The times i am rude i usually have a reason, like someone acting like an asshole. <br>
<br>
As i remember it Landragoran with his group moved down the tunnel to our camp (we were camping just above the Captains room in the tunnel) and stopped to chat for a few minutes. I used to know Landragoran as I was his guildleader a year ago or so. As far as i know when this happened he remembered me and this would be the reason he stopped and talked with us before he moved past the BK camp which was dead then .. because we killed it.. this usually indicates someome is camping it.. we also told him what we were camping etc.. <br>
<br>
&quot;It was really outta proportion, since we never had any verbal contact with them before the hate tells started&quot;<br>
<br>
How you can say this im not sure, or maybe i dont understand what you are saying? we did have verbal contact.. we did talk and i thought you were a friend.. or something like that.. until you did what you did... I was not rude when i first sent you a tell, i asked what you were doing and when i understood what you were up to.. yeah.. i was upset. People acting like fucking assholes tend to make me upset. <br>
<br>
Yes you offered to drag our bodies to zone, and i would not accept your &quot;help&quot; as i dislike you.. is that strange? I had no trouble pulling the damn corpses to zone from tunnel.. rogues have this funny ability called hide which combined with the other ability which is sneak.. make this pretty easy.. <br>
<br>
&quot;but sometimes people are just rude&quot;<br>
<br>
Yes, but some people are rude more than others... right Landragoran? you should know ... you have always come across as pretty rude to me.. but we didnt bitch about it, we didnt run to the boards and cry about it because it wont do much good... Jellah just thought it was very ironic of you to go do just that when someone does to you what you did to us.. I wouldnt have been very upset if it wasnt someone i kinda knew and thought deserved a little respect.. if i happen to see you again in EQ i know what to expect now though.. guess thats a good thing atleast. <br>

Isnt that camp stealing? YOU did NOT call for another camp check, we had friends in the zone the whole time. Our cleric had gated out to the zone in for chardok, the cleric was not out of zone for more than 30 seconds. This came to our attention cause the druid friend of ours in the other group saw the BK was no longer on track.<br>
<br>
We did not jump to conclusions, maybe the BK was too far for the druid to see? But the druid doubted that since he could always see when he was up from where he was. The BK was killed MINUTES after we died. What you did was plain and simple camp stealing, while not against verant policy, it is considered by the community a shitty ass thing to do. Seems to me you knew we were camping it and did in fact saw that we died and moved right in ready to say &quot;oh I didnt know&quot;. You DID NOT offer the camp back. Trust me, if you had apologized and offered it back, it would have been annoying to lose the one spawn of the named but at least would have been better and we would have camped it still.<br>
<br>
I didnt talk to you, I find it bad to have multiple people sending tells to a person over a dispute. Group to group arguing is chaos and never resolves anything. One person from our group talked to YOU, one person in your group. What he got was that you were not gonna give the camp back and were basically being a jerk about it. So our choices are, 1) we can sit and argue or...2) we can move on to somthing fun and get rid of the total annoyance we are feeling. We chose 2.<br>
<br>
BTW, from what I understand, the mob you are arguing about with Givin, is definitely different as it is a FFA mob and your group could not handle it and had taken its two shots. It isnt exactly a camp per say. What you took from us was a named exp camp. We could handle the camp we were in, that is not to say we wont die from time to time. But our cleric was in the zone, our rogue on his way and then boom we would be back in business.<br>
<br>
We didnt accept the help, cause we truly didnt need it, we simply wanted our camp back. Our rogue was able to pull the corpses and our cleric was able to rez fine. The only real problem we had here was a group taking our camp over within 2 min of dying.<br>
<br>
Call me childish for not talking to you, but I think it is childish for a bunch of people to send tells to one person over a matter that needs to be resolved. We did not take it to public channels as you did either. We did not come to the boards to make it even MORE public as you did either. I bring it to the  boards now cause your post and the irony of it hit way to hard.<br>
<br>
I ask you , why would I make all this up? Why were you in our camp to begin with? you already had gone past the camp, why would you be in it 2 min after we died? Those are good questions as far as I am concerned, and we were sopposed to feel better that you would be willing to move our corpses out of your way so you could camp our camp?<br>
<br>
I repeat the question WHAT WERE YOU DOING KILLING A MOB YOU KNEW TO BE CAMPED? WHAT WERE YOU DOING IN OUR CAMP WITHIN MINUTES OF US DYING? You did not call a new camp check, our cleric knows this, the other group knows this. Our cleric zoned back in to wait for our rogue just to call our camp in any camp checks. <br>
<br>
Seems to me the community had your number now Landrogoran. BTW just a note on the incident with Givin, I dont know him or any members of fallen legacy to my knowledge anyway. That mob is not a camp, its a FFA and your group had taken two shots, you were too low to do it. Not right to hold the mob up from people who need the mob so you can practice and goof around. Plenty of other camps to do that at. I am sure if you hang around a zone where wipe outs happen you will surely get a camp, the same way you got the BK from our group. We had a named exp camp that you took, givin killed an unengaged FFA mob that you had taken two shots at .... there is a difference. you camp stole, givin killed a mob he had every right to. <p><center><img src="http://www.danos.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/jellah.gif" width="577" height="162"></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/undian.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ndian</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t d00d!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(2/4/02 1:59:20 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumrantsandravesbalancingissues.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1631.topic&index=104>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Givin, KSer with a rotten attitude.</span><hr size=1> Land, if you're ISP is so &quot;shitty&quot;, then you shouldn't be anywhere near VP much less go in there.

But that still gives him no right to bitch and moan at them for killing the mob when no one claimed the camp. I would understand if I was camping something, my group died, and another group came in and took the camp over.<br>
<br>
Why? Because no one was there to respond to camp check. So that group had no clue if it was camped. Simple as that. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=59818" target=_blank">Kodylan</a> Stompioras

I was pretty upset that they took the Verix spawn as I had camped his PH on several occasions without seeing a pop, and was pretty miffed that they wouldn't respect my camp.  <br>
<br>
As to the Jellah/Maxander thing, I believe I have explained myself.  it was quite a while ago and I may not have all the details perfectly correct, but I do remember being upset that I was only getting secondhand information from someone in my group instead of being able to actually talk to someone in Jellah's group.  As for why we were there so fast?  Well as I recall we had gone up to Observer camp and I was pulling as usual.  I usually pull down the ramp, keeping mobs inc always and slowed for the melees to chew through while I go get more.  So I get down to BK camp and the BK is up, I don't see their group anywhere.  I do remember now that I didn't do a camp check, I did a /who command to see if anyone from that group was in zone.  They weren't, so I figured they had finished and zoned out.  They were camping a significant distance down the hall from the BK camp, so I couldn't have possibly seen their dead bodies.  I was like, cool, BK for us!  And I pulled it, group killed it, we moved down.   <br>
<br>
In retrospect I suppose the folks from FL could have done the same thing, and during the 5 minutes my group was absent from the zone they might have just claimed the camp/verix pop.  If that was the case I can understand it a little more.  Doesn't make me much less aggravated tho, since I contacted them immediately once they were there and let them know I had been camping it.  At that point the cleric told me Givin was claiming to have been camping it for hours, an obvious lie.  This was all before they started killing the mobs that had repopped to get to Verix.  <br>
<br>
As for Malvenia, you really got yer panties in a wad over that incident and I wasn't able to placate you.  Which was frustrating to me, I wanted to resolve it but couldn't.  I guess &quot;You really disliked&quot; me at that point and further discussion was pointless.  Pity, I used to really like you too.  <br>
<br>
I was guilty in that incident of perhaps moving too fast on a camp and not doing enough checking.  Ok fine.  Your group blew it outta proportion from there, probably over exasperation at losing the named?  Big deal really, since he pops like 1 in 3 times and usually drops something crappy and stupid.  <br>
<br>
Again I apologize for blowing up at FL, although I still think Givin did a bad thing by steamrolling me.  I'm not happy with him or the folks who helped him.  <br>
<br>
As for the wiping on verix thing, what can I say?  I obviously suck and am a bad player.  For anyone who wants to camp him tho, I'd watch for adds on the pull if the area isn't broken when he pops.  Verix summons help I think, and he tends to wander around while summoning people with him into moats and such.  I've never seen a mob behave that strangely.  Just a warning for folks who attempt him.  <br>
<br>
P.S. the verix that popped after I logged was killed by my own guildies and MQed to me.  I guess karma was in my favor at that point?  And enough with the cheap cracks on Pengy eh?  He was the one who helped kill Verix and MQed it with me.  Whatever, I'm done discussing this.  <br>

<br>
You also wouldnt have seen our live bodies either then, we died at our pull spot. As for doing a /who all in the zone, our cleric was not out of zone for more than 30 seconds, she is a lucky fast zoner (unlike me), and btw you are aware that groups evac or zone out from time to time if in trouble. If you had done a camp check to make sure, you would have recieved a response that BK was indeed still camped.<br>
<br>
In the end, the misunderstanding was not the big deal, you made it clear to Max that your group was KEEPING the camp. That was the issue that made me upset. Once you realized all your assumptions were incorrect, you decided that since your group was there now you were STAYING. I guess by appeasing us you mean how you offered to drag our corpses, I guess we should have felt ok about you taking our camp then.<br>
<br>

Hmm we did? One group member talked to you, only one, you did not get tells from 6 different people cursing you to hell. We did not take it to public channels as you did with Givin. We did not curse your guild and call them names. We did not come start a rant about you or the incident. Yes Max and the rest of us were pissed off that you decided you were STAYING in a camp you knew dam well we were camping. BUT we left and did not stay and argue endlessly. <br>
<br>
I am done with this, I think Land has shown his true colors and maybe you even learned somthing. Possibly you wont be so quick to do what you did that day in BK, since you were so upset when you felt this was done to you, imagine how we felt..... then realize we didnt blow up even closely to the way you did. <p><center><img src="http://www.danos.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/jellah.gif" width="577" height="162"></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uigottomuchgameforyou.showPublicProfile?language=EN>igottomuchgameforyou</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I live here.... get out.</span><br> <font color=#000033>(2/5/02 1:36:36 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumrantsandravesbalancingissues.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1631.topic&index=111>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Givin, KSer with a rotten attitude.</span><hr size=1> Land you make yourself sound dumber everytime you try to argue with Jellah.

venrix is a rare random spawn.  And if you can wipe out to him you have no business even dreaming about vp.  This is some funny ass shit though, even though I would argue that he isnt an ffa mob, since its basically a rare not entirely special dungeon spawn with a ph in a camp that can easily be taken by 1 group or less if they actually have a chance at vp.<br>
