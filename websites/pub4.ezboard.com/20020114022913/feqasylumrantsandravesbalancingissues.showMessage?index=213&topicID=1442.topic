<br>
Visions knew releasing the sleeper would upset FL.<br>
They did it anyways.<br>
* List Visions reasons 1-1001 here *&quot;<br>
<br>
Bottom line is this, we did something we have been working on for 7 months. We did our first serious attempt that got him to 60% before you even killed Zlandicar, which was about 2 months ago. We finished our quest that we spent over half a year working on because WE wanted to do it for ourselves, not to spite anyone else. We knew we wouldn't be able to get anymore warder loot, we don't do things just for loot. We do things for fun and this was something we worked very hard for. <br>

It may not have been all of you (and to those it isn't, thank you for YOUR tells recently, your friendship matters), but from the tells I got last night from others, and some of them from leadership, I was totally justified in my opinion.  Regardless, it's been a rallying point, for all of us, for different reasons.  I see some fun times ahead of lanys, the warders weren't the be all end all, but it's sad to see them gone. <p><img src="http://www.conquest-guild.com/Elessar/newsig.jpg"><BR>

Remember that long talk we had a few months ago in SK. The one where at the end, I went to the arena with you... Remember the points I made about Visions steamrolling over people at any cost, and how that was totally against my morals. Seems nothing has changed.<br>
<br>
You knew what was going to happen if all 4 warders were killed. You see, there are a few people in FL with a brain too. And we were not shocked that this happened. We talked some about this happening when we first started getting ST keys. And it seemed to me that a fair number of us felt that when we started going into ST, that Visions would react swiftly to drop all four warders.<br>
<br>
Fast forward 6 weeks or so. Two groups of FL members enter ST and begin killing golems. Golems respawn faster than warders, but also need less people to kill. FL cleared to the Master of the Guard, and then dropped him within a few days in ST. Golem farming continued daily, dropping a few Priceless weapons as expected,. and apparently, 1 primal warsword. Suddenly, Friday night, just 7 days after FL kills its first mob in ST, people in FL start getting tons of tells from Visions people saying that Visions was going to kill all 4 warders the following night. <br>
<br>
Sure enough, Visions suddenly manages to find the people to drop all 4 warders. Something they admit they had never succeeded in being able to do before.<br>
<br>
You sit here and repeat time after time that this has been a goal for many months. Even Caex who hasnt been in Visions for many months, but instead was in FL until rather recently, keeps spewing this out. Of course you also have as goals killing everything in the game. So I guess you could say this about everything.<br>
<br>
As for all your various statements about how you dont give a shit about what FL does...<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> HAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Let me repeat that in case you missed it...<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> HAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
There are so many members of Visions that watch us closer than the GM's do that its not even funny. And we seem to have GM's around at almost every big fight we do. There are people in Visions that appear to be downright paranoid about anyone getting close to anything they have had to themselves for many, many months now. But those same people come here and act like they dont pay attention to FL at all.<br>
<br>
I still remember the times when 7D went to kill Zlandicar, and Visions send LilMiss into DN to sit there and monitor everything we did and said. So please stop with the crap about how Visions doesnt care or pay attention to what other guilds do. You not only care, you pay very, very close attention to anyone that might be able to touch the mobs you have had solo for 6 months now.<br>
<br>
There also appears to be another misconception on the part of Visions. We keep being told to be happy because its easier to farm primal now, and that the warder drops were crap anyways. <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> HELLLLLLLOOOOOOOOOO! Get PHAT LEWT out of your heads!</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Not one post in this entire 10 page thread says anything about missing out on loot by any FL member. The only people talking about loot are Visions people. This is not about loot. This is about mobs. And the removal of mobs from the game by one guild just days before another guild would have finally been able to play with one of them.<br>
<br>
So instead of going to Sleepers with 3-4 groups for a few hours to kill 3 Warders once a week, we now have to farm Golems around the clock, 7 days a week, to even have a chance at collecting as much primal for our melee. And you felt we should thank you for that?<br>
<br>
Arduin: go buy a cloo<br>
<br>
Wysper: Dont twist my words. I said that if our roles were reversed, Visions would have been given time to kill warders. We would have eventually dropped all 4 warders, but not for some time. You guys obviously decided to make sure nobody else on this server ever even sees one, much less kills one. HUGE DIFFERENCE!<br>
<br>
Karsys: We didnt ask to be helped. If you thought that you killing all 4 warders was a favor to us in any, way shape or form, you were wrong. And if you DIDNT stop and think about how we would have felt about you removing the warders from the game just before we reached the point where we could kill one of them, then you need to learn a few things about common decency. Unfortunately, Visions keeps proving time and time again that they dont care who they trample over, they will do whatever they want. And the downside to what you did is <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> NOT</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> about loot. Its 4 mobs missing from Sleepers Tomb now.<br>
<br>
Caex: Didnt think you could hurt anyone eh? Did you ask Taliesn? You said he was one of your best friends. Did you even stop to think for one second about asking him how he would feel about this? You keep posting like you have been in Visions forever, but you were in FL less than 2 months ago.<br>
<br>
Kamufuk: You continue to attempt to baffle us with your bullshit. It still isnt working. <p><BR><b>Bigmeeno</b><BR>Barbarian Oracle<BR><i><a href="http://www.fallenlegacy.com">Fallen
