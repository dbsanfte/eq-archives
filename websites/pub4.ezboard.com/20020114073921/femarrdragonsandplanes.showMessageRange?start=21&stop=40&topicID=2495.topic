<br>
Think about the infamy you gain by dropping the sleeper.<br>
<br>
1) you are the only ones on e-marr to do it<br>
2) you permanently (from what I gather) get to lord over people the phat loot that the sleeper drops knowing that no one else on this server will ever get one just like yours.<br>
3) hell just being the people that get to fuck over 2000+ players now that would make some drool.<br>
<br>
It was meant to be killed, and I seriously doubt that they will take him down anytime within the next 6 months. so all you ones that want to farm gear nows your chance.  Yes I said 6 months why, well I think you are all too much of a bunch of play nice pansies to drop this bitch.<br>

You may be referring to the screenshots of Da`Kor releasing the Sleeper (killed all 4 Warders), I believe they were the second guild to accomplish that across all the servers (could be slightly off). <br>
<br>
The Warders have been upgraded since then, and the coding of ST changed. Now when you kill all 4 Warders at the same time, you release the Sleeper and he flies off to do battle with Veeshan and neither he nor any of the Warders ever spawns again on that server. Both Magister and MSF have gotten up to the 4th Warder (MSF first I believe, could be wrong there too), but neither force has been able to kill it.<br>
<br>
Irregardless of all that, the Sleeper was never intended to be killed. (I think I heard somewhere that he's been parsed to have several million HP and a zonewide DT, which means he's not meant to die.) Just want to say that plainly so that the people thinking that guilds have killed him or should attempt to kill him can understand a bit more about him.<br>

#1 Da`kor did not kill the sleeper, they were one of the two guilds to kill all 4 warders before the buff(maybe 3 guilds).  Sleeper is completely unkillable, like Jhaled'dar. Think AoW who DTs.<br>
#2 If you kill all 4 warders, Kerafym is awakened and he goes on his rampage. Supposedly the script is finished, I'll believe it when I see it.<br>
#3 When Kerafym is done, he disappears, never to be seen again. The Warders do not return. As far as I know, Warder drops will not be moved. However, the named golems will now drops more primal than they used to. I do not know if they changed which they can drop(atm they almost always drop 2h primals). <br>
#4 Killing Venanti gives you a new quest. Once Kerafym finishes his rampage, a mob named Melinfen will spawn in WW. You give him a scale(found off certain mobs in ST) and your ST key, and he returns you an item. You can return it to him for a repeatable cycle of items(not just 5, 8 I believe, although I may be wrong). <br>
#5 Sleepers tomb is NOT the endgame. If you want to call anything the endgame its N ToV. Better loot, harder mobs(with the exception of Venanti) etc etc etc. <br>
<br>
To summarize, when you kill the 4th warder you simply hurt everyone else's chances of getting Primal. You may or may not remove the ability to get SoDs, dainty gloves, illusion masks, etc from the game, depending on what info you believe. You get to loot the 4th warder once. EVERYONE is then given the option of turning in a scale from ST along with their key for a pretty good item. The fact you have to turn in your ST key will put even more pressure on some of the most pressured mobs in the game(Zlandicar under pressure from a lot of guilds already, Lenidaria, Sont, Klandi not far behind) when Magister decides it needs to farm more keys to get more melinfen quests(and MS, and Sf, and UI, and everyone eventually).  I wouldn't fault anyone for doing it. Its the progression of the game. I would however ask that everyone /feedback that they think the current setup sucks.  Neutralizing a goal for a lot of players simply because they have not gotten to that point is stupid. As is making people turn in their ST key to delay the influx of items and create more pressure on already overpressured mobs.  Just my opinion.......<br>

PS: Btw, if you want to kill all 4 warders, you need double digit dragonsbane. That means camping that fucking dragon for 3-4 months straight.

And you could theoretically skip the first Warder and kill the last three (last Warder drops better loot than the first) and all 4 Warders and the Sleeper would still be there after the next patch. That'd be one way of getting 4th Warder loot and not perma-killing them. As I understand it though Magister's current goal in ST is the release of the Sleeper.<br>

Sorry, pet peeve of mine.<br>
<br>
When some of you say that Magister or MSF would be screwing over 2000 people by releasing the Sleeper, you're overstating your case by a factor of 10 or so.  There are few people on this server who are capable of going to ST, and the list is not expanding that fast.  How many more guilds do you really think will be raiding ST before the end of this year?  The vast majority of the people on the server will never be able to go to ST, and their lives will not be any poorer for it.<br>
<br>
It's important to remember that Verant believes that EQ has a storyline, though few people seem to be able to discern what it is.  With Luclin coming out in about two months, Verant will have a perfect opportunity to extend the story about the Sleeper.  The counter-quest that Glori mentioned could very well be part of Luclin.<br>
<br>
Finally, don't forget the indications that Verant is planning to release EQ2 next year.  If that's true, the release of the Sleeper could be part of the storyline transition from EQ1 to EQ2.  But that might be assuming too much foresight on the part of Verant. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ukanibaalkorpseem.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kanibaal Korpse EM</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 510<br> <font color=#E9D756>(10/5/01 8:03:41 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.somethingawful.com/cliff/ihateyou/uglycat.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Sleepers Tomb and the 4th Warder</span><hr size=1> MS isnt into releasing the sleeper.  would F over people who are getting keys to get primal now.  why do that?  the items you get from the quest after the sleeper is released arent better then Ntov drops. <p><center><img src=http://eosone.i8.com/kani_sig.jpg></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ujubei1.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Jubei1</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 553<br> <font color=#E9D756>(10/5/01 8:28:28 am)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.midnightsojourn.com/images/jubei.jpg WIDTH=110 HEIGHT=90></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Sleepers Tomb and the 4th Warder</span><hr size=1> MS/SF are not trying to release Sleeper.

The point being that the rewards for releasing the Sleeper do not justify the loss of rewards from the warders.  Kill 2,3, and 4 and leave one up.  You can still say you killed the 4th warder and had the first dropped you would have released the Sleeper.  IMHO, the best option for everyne involved.  But that's my opinion and other will do as they please. <p>Jaeden Grae<br>

  Personally, I'm rather ambivalent about the entire issue.  I think that it's a waste of time trying to kill the 4rth warder explicitly for the purpose of seeing a Verant pet mob DT people, but it's not a waste of time to necessarily kill him because &quot;he is there&quot;.<br>
<br>
  It also seems to me that if one releases the Sleeper, you are actually doing your own guild a disservice in regards to future guildmates who's end game dream may be to see ST (ie: kill warders, maybe they have some warder specific loot in mind, or maybe they just want to see the zone as it was initially).<br>
<br>
  On the flip side, the paltry handfull of warder specific items are not so absurd that one *must* wield any one of them to be happy.  Ya, they've got some rather nice things, but the goal of ST is primal, not gnome masks and resistance stones, and primal doesn't vanish off with the release of the Sleeper.<br>

  If the cycle could be completed and the Sleeper recaptured, life would be good and easy.  If it required 10 ST keys to recapture him, I wonder what the interest would be though.  Maybe whomever releases him should have their DB wiz give up their keys, they are only in there for the purpose of killing the 4rth Warder anyway (not trying to diss the fun a wiz might have in ST or the wiz class, just speaking from a loot perspective) :p<br>
<br>
  Anyway, whatever.  The goal of releasing the Sleeper = waste of time.  Killing the 4rth warder for loot = good challenge.<br>

SYLLABICATION: ir·re·gard·less <br>
PRONUNCIATION:  r-gärdls <br>
ADVERB: Nonstandard Regardless.  <br>
ETYMOLOGY: Probably blend of irrespective and regardless. <br>
USAGE NOTE: Irregardless is a word that many mistakenly believe to be correct usage in formal style, when in fact it is used chiefly in nonstandard speech or casual writing. Coined in the United States in the early 20th century, it has met with a blizzard of condemnation for being an improper yoking of irrespective and regardless and for the logical absurdity of combining the negative ir– prefix and –less suffix in a single term. Although one might reasonably argue that it is no different from words with redundant affixes like debone and unravel, it has been considered a blunder for decades and will probably continue to be so.  <br>

&quot;Irregardless&quot; is one of my pet peeves too.  When you deconstruct it, it makes no real sense.  Just because people know what is meant by it doesn't mean it's valid. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ugilgamelavamar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gilgamel Avamar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 520<br> <font color=#E9D756>(10/5/01 10:18:44 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Sleepers Tomb and the 4th Warder</span><hr size=1> I love you too Pad. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uceldor.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Celdor</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 1236<br> <font color=#E9D756>(10/5/01 11:54:24 am)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> <BR><img src=http://home.austin.rr.com/mav1973/aegishjalmr.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Sleepers Tomb and the 4th Warder</span><hr size=1> Glori, while it is clear that it is considered a blunder, even your description classifies it as a word that can be used in casual/non-formal speech/writing. The fact that it is an equivalent to other words which are generally not used in formal writing (EX. ain't), does not bear on its validity as a word.<br>
<br>
It's a word for casual conversation or writing. I have been known to say it out loud once or twice and I occasionally use ain't as well in my daily conversation. Then again I am from Texas, where we have a very informal manner of speaking. <p><small><br><br><br><br>Celdor Dreamweaver - Bard - Ret.
