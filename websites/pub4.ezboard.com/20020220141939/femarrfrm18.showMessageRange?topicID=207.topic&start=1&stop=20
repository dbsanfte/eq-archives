The Israelis could never get this far in the process...only offering provinces within Israel, and never Palestinian owned land.<br><br>The Bush Administration is only doing this to gain Arab support, but nonetheless....finally there will be REAL progress to end Israeli occupation of Palestinians.<br><br>This is the right move to end terrorism around the world. With Arab support, the cowards involved in the September 11th bombing will be brought to justice, and the Taliban will realize they aren't fighting for any cause whatsoever.<br><br>It bothers me that it took a tragedy for these steps to be made in favor of the Palestinians. It really bothers me. However, this move is one of the greatest ever made by the United States Government. It will protect the United States from terrorism, and it will destroy Al-Queda and Osama bin Laden.<br><br>I found it rather sad when I read this, however....<br><br><font color=yellow>Bush added the two parties needed to get to work "on the Mitchell process" which he said provides a clear path to solving the crisis in the Middle East. <br><br><b>He refused, when asked, to say whether he had been prepared to announce his support for a Palestinian state before the September 11 suicide attacks on Washington and New York. </b></font color><br><br>That's because he didn't support it.

The fact that it's Jews and Muslims fighting right now is a relatively recent developement.  <br><br>The belief that the enmity and conflict between the Jews and Muslims is a linear progression of both Jewish and Islamic history is a colonial construction.  Example: When the British came to India they set up shop and tried to figure out why violent riots sometimes erupted.  They decided it was because of Hindu and Muslim fighting.  In reality, as in the case of Israel, these conflicts were mostly political.  However, it was only once the British said &quot;Hindus and Muslims have always fought each other, always will, and can never reconcile&quot; that a Hindu vs. Muslim identity was created. This is probably the single biggest reason Pakistan ended up being created. <br><br>I'll give you the point that the way the current situation exists in Israel comes from a quite different history, but I will contend that by saying it's an unreconciliable conflict you only increase the division as well as 'sharpen' the identities of both the Israelis and the Palestinians.<br><br>glade<br><br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/umaeri.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Maeri</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 319<br> <font color=#E9D756>(10/17/01 11:10:23 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=207.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://users.bigpond.net.au/nettle/eq/maeri/maeri.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ugh.</span><hr size=1> Prior to the founding of Israel, interactions between Muslims and Jews were generally much more civil than interactions between Christians and Jews. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/upoppensteelfist.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Poppen Steelfist</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 118<br> <font color=#E9D756>(10/18/01 9:08:52 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=207.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ugh.</span><hr size=1> Here Miblis, <br><br>Since Trech apparently has been a bit too busy to respond to this I will finish your unfinished assumption of what he meant.  <br><br>The creation of a Palestinian State must be something that is undertaken with great care..since the U.S. has a very well established policy of not dealing with or negotiating with terrorists.

To create a Palestinian state will be in a way bowing to terrorism.

Did you know that the US had an arms embargo in Israel until 1955?  In fact, our close ties to Israel really only date to *after* the 1973 Yom Kippur war in which Israel was attacked by a dozen or so Islamic Arab states.  It was the US that pressured Israel to stop their counterattack in that war, a counter attack which decimated a military force fielded by Arab states that was larger than the combined NATO forces in Europe at the time.  500 Israelies faced off over 80,000 Egyptians, and about 100 Israeli aicraft faced off over 1400 aircraft from the Arab states.<br><br>At the time, Israel was mostly flying French-made fighters not US fighters.  We only entered the picture when the USSR threatened to directly intervene on behalf of the agressors (Egypt, Syria, Jordan, Iraq, and a host of others).  The US and the UN then pressured Israel to stop their counterattack.  After this resounding defeat of communnist backed forces by Israel, the US began to back Israel.<br><br><br>Modern terrorism and Yassar Arafat were effectively created by the Egyptian ruler Nasser.  Nasser forwarded the idea of using state-sponsored terrorists to unseat Israel, and used the PLO as the source of suicide bombers and fanatics to attack Israel.  He called his Palestinian and Egyptian terrorists Fedayeen.<br><br>The PLO charter repeatedly iterates that their goal is the destruction of Israel.<br><br>I think changing our policy regarding Israel is a decisive victory for Islamic terrorists.  It shows that if you want the USA to change its stance on something, all you need to do is blow up a few buildings or otherwise scare the american people.  <br><br>It would also show that we are not a very good 'friend' of other countries, when the going gets tough we run with our tails tucked.  <br><br>-Dak<br><br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/umiblis.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Miblis</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 173<br> <font color=#E9D756>(10/31/01 1:30:11 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=207.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> WarAngel1</span><hr size=1> <br><font color=yellow>You really should research your facts a bit instead of buying off on the mantran of middle-east politicians.</font color><br><br>Ok so following this phrase, you went off on a historical rampage to show that the United States is what....neutral?

I love how American news-agencies give so much material for both of you to use.<br><br>First of all, I want to point out that you, Kytherion, are a fucking idiot.  Plain and simple.  What was quite a civil argument in this thread, turned into a flamefest which YOU started.  Are you upset that New York and Washington were attacked?  So am I.  Are you going to let it cloud the truth?  Sure you are, kind of like when Vendrix and that fucking whore Justicia decided it would be best to execute all Arabic people in their countries with nuclear weapons.  Read 'A Special Place in Hell' if you want to see me belittle their ignorant asses.<br><br>You want me to elaborate, Kytherion?  Do you have any idea what happened between 1947 and 1960 in Israel?  Any clue whatsoever?  Or no...you only know what's been happening this year.  Jump on the "I hate Arabs" bandwagon some more, fucker.  With each little tiny remark you make, it shows how much more racist you really are.  How does it feel to be garbage?<br><br>Let me school you a little bit on this worthless, ignorant remark:<br><br><font color=yellow>"Oh and guess what, the U.S. proclaiming that they will help shape a Palestinian nation, now, then changing their mind later probably isn't the best idea."<br><br>Haha! Or what? They'll...commit terrorist acts? Use bioweapons? Stop sucking up UN charity? <br></font color><br><br>You can count on one hand how many people it took to kill 6000 people, Kytherion.  Do you realize how dangerous someone is, when they are willing to die?  5 to 6000, that is SOME FUCKING RATIO!  If in fact, Al Queda consists of 2500 loyal followers, start comparing ratios.  If you and most Americans, including myself for quite a long time, believe that we are invincible, then you're dead wrong.  We aren't invincible.  Are we the most powerful country in the world?  Yeah.  However when someone is willing to die, that person is automatically 10,000x more dangerous then you, sitting with your loaded shotgun.  To stop the threat, policy needs to change, and giving the Palestinians land will not only be the right thing for Palestinians, but it will also ensure safety for our country.  That's not cowardly, that's smart.<br><br>Warangel said this:<br><br><font color=yellow>Ridiculous.

I want one valid reason why Israelis are responsible for their being a country on the world-globe named Israel.  See, it doesn't take a right-wing Islamic Fundamentalist to view pure common sense.  Common sense, Warangel1, Common sense.  Take a moment and read all of your historic mumbo-jumbo you have tried attacking me with, and see for yourself why Israel has succeeded.  The Israeli Government, and their 'Prime-Minister-of-the-week-program' is shit.  Plain and simple, man.  I'm not a fundamentalist.  Their government is trash.  The reason it is alive right now, is because of the United States and the United Nations.  Once again, I re-iterate.....they have done nothing for themselves.  Can you begin to understand this?  Surely you carry more intelligence then Kytherion.<br><br>Last but not least....politicians lie, sure they do.  However this time, it could endanger you in your own home.
