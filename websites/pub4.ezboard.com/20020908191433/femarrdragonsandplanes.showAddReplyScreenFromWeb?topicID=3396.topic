<br>
Do I think I was scammed? Either (1) I was scammed or (2) there was a bug of some type, or (3) I screwed it up all by myself and got what I deserved. <br>
<br>
You can read this and it might help you form an opinion.  This is not a flame directed at Freyia, merely my version of what happened, as I saw it, with some guest commentary from Lead-gm Vharyon.<br>
<br>
All stories have more than one side to them, and can be filled with assumptions or even be biased in their reporting, with that said, this is my account of what went down in FV on my chain questing of the Staff of Elemental Mastery: Earth (PoH Mage staff). I knew this was a risky proposition, so was weighing risk vs. reward as I began this endeavor. I did make some mistakes and will list them, even though some are embarrassing, based on the stupidity I showed.<br>
<br>
The story starts with a mage I was talking to (Freyia) that thought a hate staff (for mage epic) was easier to get than PoA crown for her, so she considered selling her staff to get funds for a crown, and would go camp a staff to replace it at a later time, after buying a crown. We came up with 50k as price to have her chain the staff to me. This is early (3:00) in morning Saturday 6/1/02. <br>
<br>
We go to FV after I have paid 1/2 in advance. She turns in staff, I turn in 2 right and 1 &quot;wrong&quot; item. The NPC returns my wrong item telling me it is not the correct item. (this is when i realize something is not going well). After realizing my error, I go to the nearby bank and 4 1/2 min later return to turn in the correct remaining item, still no reward. I figure it is all my fault since I screwed up the quest. I keep my word and pay the balance to Freyia, since I figured to be at fault. I take some screenshots, petition and then I begin my wait for a GM response.<br>
<br>
People have asked: Didn’t you see the text message: thanks for uber_item_01 but where is _02 _03 and _04?<br>
Many of the NPC’s for quests do not respond in any way until they get all items in their possession, so no, I did not.<br>
<br>
She did advise that we camp out and try to get character resets as she had mentioned in a post of hers, but I did not really understand that process so I didn’t do it. She tells me if I had done this all would have been fine, but since I chose not to, all of the trouble is caused by me not listening to her.<br>
<br>
Sounds like I screwed up so I got what I deserved, right? <br>
The plot thickens, read on......<br>
<br>
Over the next few days I continue to petition and talk with various guides (Teagus, Kaithlyn, and Tobryn) all who did a fine job of responding and acting helpful as they took down the information of my failed quest. Finally, I get to chat with Vharyon Lead-gm of our server on Tuesday night June 4. Here is what transpired. I personally think the timestamps of the actions tell a lot, time to put on your detective hats.<br>
<br>
I am typing this as it was said by Vharyon, to me (Bodar) and have all text on screenshots. I still have the screenshots but am not sure how to post to this or to other forums, if anyone actually cares.  Here are some of the specific excerpts from our conversation that sum up the result of my petition. <br>
<br>
Vharyon tells you, 'the issue is you did not turn in all the items'<br>
<br>
Vharyon tells you, 'Also in the logs see Freyia turned in the full complement of items'<br>
<br>
/em jaw drops to the floor and realizes something is amiss.<br>
<br>
Vharyon tells you, 'at 3:14:32 Freyia turned in: Staff of Elemental Mastery, Shovel of Ponz, Dirt of the Underfoot, and Broom of Triflon'<br>
<br>
/em sits in stunned disbelief staring at the text on my screen. <br>
<br>
Vharyon tells you, 'then at 3:17:32 it shows you turning in Broom of Triflon, Dirt of the Underfoot, and Torch of Alna'<br>
<br>
This was where I clearly made a mistake by turning in torch instead of Shovel. What kind of Moron would turn in wrong items? Well, this time I was that Moron. I accepted the fact that I screwed up. I am a person of my word, and since I believed that I caused this quest to fail, and I had an agreement that I made in good faith, I paid the remaining portion of the agreed price, (though I felt like crap) because that was the right thing to do.<br>
<br>
Vharyon tells you, 'then at 3:22:07 you turned in Shovel of Ponz'<br>
<br>
If you notice, there is a 3-minute time lapse from her turning in item (3:14) until I turned in item (3:17), this is info I was quite surprised to get from the GM due to the fact that I turned in my items (even though they were wrong items, within 10 seconds or so of her telling me she had handed in the Hate Staff. If you have ever had a chaining done, you know you do not stand there at the NPC for 3 minutes after being told the other item was turned in before turning in your items. I also had an open inventory slot at the time.<br>
<br>
To further explain this 3-minute gap, here is what was happening during that time.  Freyia was KOS to Firona Drixies and Pilgrims. The quest NPC (Tiblner) wanders the land outside of the city. I had my mage, (Bodar) camped at the bridge and was tracking the NPC with my druid (Yoora). When I got to the NPC I hailed and held him until Freyia came along (with a pet up to fend off attacks from KOS mobs). She began to hail him to hold him while I was getting my mage (Bodar) logged on (same account). By the time I had logged on and run from the bridge to the npc, the timing appears to leave a window in which she could have completed her full handing in of the items (based on the timing on the logs read to me by lead-gm Vharyon). She however, claims otherwise.<br>
 <br>
This is where the conflict arises: <br>
Lead-gm Vharyon says she turned in 4 items, <br>
Freyia contends she only turned in 1 item. <br>
One of them is incorrect here, could it be her? Sure. <br>
Could it be verant/sonyeq/Vharyon/bug? Sure, why not? <br>
 <br>
I have been in contact with Freyia and she seems quite sincere about not turning in the 4 items to complete quest, but I have copy of the screenshot of lead-gm Vharyon telling me otherwise. I typed the exact words of Vharyon to her in tells, and she still contends that his claim is INCORRECT. <br>
<br>
If she did or didn’t turn in the items but the logs say she did, she either (a) has the element of earth knowingly/unknowingly or (b) should have received the element of earth and didn’t, and should petition to get it.  If either of these two things occur or have happened, the only missing piece of the puzzle is the 50kpp. If the gm comes back by recanting what he told me and it was a total screw up then I am out my plat, and have already assumed that to be that case and will accept it.<br>
<br>
As of 6/6 she told me she had not checked her bags to see if somehow she received the element of earth (quest reward) from the FV NPC. If for some reason, she has the power of earth or gets it through petition, the return of the plat would make things all good in my book. I would only be out about a days work to recover my 3 other epic parts. She had pledged to get me a staff in game after this incident, in a show of good faith on her part, but after all of the rants and attacks on her in this and other forums, I know that is no longer the case, since I am at the heart of this “smear campaign”.<br>
<br>
This is Vharyon’s response to me trying to convince him to at least getting my 3 lame items back since technically, I was not chain questing, since his log showed she had completed the quest a few minutes earlier. (I knew this was a long-shot, but I had to try to avoid my upcoming trek back into Najena.)<br>
<br>
Vharyon tells you, I am sorry I can not justify giving you them back'<br>
<br>
I hold no resentment toward the GM or the Guides, I have always been treated well by them. Vharyon did what I needed by checking logs, and giving me the information that I had asked for.  The bottom line was I took a calculated risk and lost this time. <br>
<br>
Freyia had been polite in all of our dealings and has showed signs of sincere concern making her side of the story seem plausible even though a lot of the information makes it look skeptical. I have no need to curse her, I dont hate her, and hope this is somehow just a big misunderstanding. She is upset, and acts as a wrongly accused would. If for some reason the GM’s reverse the information that I was presented I will post an apology, though damage would most likely be past repair.<br>
<br>
I am disappointed to not get the item I was seeking but knew in advance that there was risk involved with any chaining of items, and the re-imbursement policy clearly states if a chaining goes wrong, kiss your items good-bye.<br>
<br>
I’m personally not really even mad, just disappointed, and still really enjoy playing this game. I have been after the mage epic for a long, long time and only needed one item since Jan 02, now I need 4 items. Oh well, back to Najena for me for a bit.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I am out my plat for the risk I took, If something new comes out of this, I will update and change title of post to reflect it.<br>
<br>
Where does this saga stand now?  Freyia is waiting to have discussion with the gm. I would also like to ask people not to harass her in game, because this will accomplish nothing towards getting to a win-win solution.<br>
<br>
Thanks for all the support, And if you want to rip me a new one for being an idiot, that is ok too, because I feel like one already. Sorry this was so long-winded, but feel free to ask questions or comments and I will do the best I can to answer any.<br>

The mage epic sucks pure and simple.  And for all the reasons that you just described, it seems crystal clear to me that you were ripped off by Freyia.  I would like to know if Freyia is currently holding a Power of Earth (or ever held it).  The lead GM can tell you that very easily.  That is the only way Freyia will ever clear this up.<br>
<br>
I don't know you.  I've never met you.  But if you need another to help you get any of these components back, I will assist you in any way I can.<br>

<br>
We all have your minds made about this Freyia person...as much as your willingness to look at both sides of the quarter is admirable, its not going to change things =)<br>
<br>
i'm going to start a fund. i'm throwing in 5k to get Bod his staff chained to him. If more people wish to contribute, send tells to me. Why?<br>
<br>
Sometimes someone screws up a whole community of people. This person in this case is Freyia. and Sometimes the head of this community (the server GM) has no control of the situation. Its now time for a third party to step in (us), and right what's wrong.<br>

Bodar, extremely honest post from the point of view of someone who hasn't played in a while.<br>
<br>
Shoot me a /tell if you need a ranger (no laughing.  stop, no I mean it) to help out recovering your items to the point you lost them.<br>

From what was stated above im sure that you were scammed, why would a GM lie about it anyway, and it was a nice trick of freya to get her epic that way, but not really fair towards everyone else, but then again i disapprove chaining for the epic too<br>

I talked with Darmu and thanked him for the offer of the fund.<br>
Though that was a very cool offer, and I do appreciate it, I will have to decline it.<br>
<br>
Affliction along with some others have once again proved why they are on my port for free list. (except Alekzandr, who I will port to SF glade or Tox &quot;by accident&quot;)<br>
<br>
Thanks also to those that have offered other types of help.<br>
