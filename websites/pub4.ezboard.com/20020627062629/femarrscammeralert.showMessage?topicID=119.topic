was calling for a port while in Thurgadin.   At some point, Baboonga contacted the druid in our group beseeching her to provide him the port.  Not really wanting to inconvenience us by leaving to do so, she quoted a price of 50pp.  He readily agreed.  After the port, he gave her 4pp and told her to &quot;lump it&quot;.<br><br>   To balance this, I did look to see if he had a guild affiliation and contacted the leader who happened to be in game at the moment.  To their credit &lt;should anyone else know his guild&gt;, the leader offered to make the payment to our druid and indicated that they would deal with Baboonga accordingly.  So, should any know of his guild, please do NOT paint them with his dishonor!  It was his, and his alone.   <br><br>   I post this only because with the increase in this kind of dishonorable behavior seeming to have become a habit, it seems the only thing we can do to make it less attractive is if we all make these players known for their conduct.  Perhaps it will send a message?    Ok, I'm an optimist. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ushardon.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Shardon</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 21<br> <font color=#E9D756>(5/13/01 10:41:15 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrscammeralert.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=119.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Baboonga is dishonorable</span><hr size=1> OMG he said he was going to pay 50pp and he only payed 4!

I learn a lesson without having to suffer loss.

People need to put aside the feeling of stupidity they get when they are cheated or scammed and list it so others don't have to feel the same thing.

I hardly know. I hate to see someone scammed out of anything. Even if it is a fs weapon to relpace their rusty weapon on a lvl 9 character. Not only is honour and principle an issue, but very soon in the game the items become extremly valuable if to no one else but the person being cheated out of it. <br><br>I started my guild as a group of friends since most of them were not allowed in the guild I was currently in (an all female guild). We have been very lucky to get quality players and people we call friends. I am not ashamed to let you know that Baboonga was my guild, Azure Mist. As a guild we had been watching his playing and were of the conclusion that he was not the type of person we wanted to represent our guild. Things he said in guildchat and ways he acted lead me to believe that we should remove him. I was going to discuss this with my officers at least before just doing it, if for nothing else but to let them know. When Sefa sent me a tell, my first thought was &quot;Oh no I didn't get him fast enough!&quot; Promptly I sent a tell to my Guild Whip and he was removed. <br><br>46p some might say is not serious enough for guildremoval. However, to me it is. I am very glad that Sefa brought it to my attention. If there is anyone else out there that he has slighted, and I think there very well maybe, I would like to offer my most humble apologies. After he was removed I even got a tell the next day from one of MY GUILD members that he scammed. I was turely outraged! So please beaware of his actions, and if ever anyone of my guild causes problems that are of a dishonorable nature, please don't hesitate to contact me or anymember of the guild. <br> <p>Nickle Ante<BR>Guildmistress  <a href=http://www.skidmore.edu/~mhasselb/AM/AMhome.html>Azure Mist</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/unickle.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Nickle</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 45<br> <font color=#E9D756>(5/24/01 8:03:53 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrscammeralert.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=119.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Baboonga is dishonorable</span><hr size=1> I think this person is also:<br><br>a bard named Ryaal<br><br>and someone named kkal<br><br>so beware of his other characters. and if he is not them, well they are of the same cloth as he so beware still. <p>Nickle Ante<BR>Guildmistress  <a href=http://www.skidmore.edu/~mhasselb/AM/AMhome.html>Azure Mist</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ubelddin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Belddin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 8<br> <font color=#E9D756>(5/30/01 9:19:58 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrscammeralert.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=119.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Baboonga is dishonorable</span><hr size=1> Ok I am a little late on this one.

I can't remember if they were in Azure Mist guild or not, certainly not all of them, but geez, they were begging like hell to loot Royal Armor.  They were on the far other side of the zone from where we were, and they were shouting out to us, &quot;Hey guys, are you killing the Royal Guards?  Well, could you?&quot;  We tried telling them that we didn't want to kill anything in Icewell that would kill our faction, at the time we were fighting those slimes and golem monsters on the Thurgadin A side.  I was wondering why there were level 4-20 players in Ice Well.  In Velious for that matter.<br><br>I told them that if they wanted the stuff so bad, they would have to level up to a high level and ruin their own faction.  One of them, Baboonga or not, was like &quot;Well I do have a high level character, but...&quot; they never told me about their high level character.  A couple days later I had gated back to Thurgadin for some jewel craft practice when I heard Baboonga shouting &quot;I fell down off the bridge and I can't get back up, could someone please help?&quot;  I did my jewelry practice and he was still shouting, so I jumped down off the bridge and cast invisible on him and told him to go through Ice Well.  He told me to go with him and protect him from all the god-like monsters that were in the way.  What the hell?  Those were lvl 55-57 monsters that we fought the other day, how am I supposed to protect him from those?  Well, I invis'd myself and ran up ahead without the poor kid to see what was ahead.  A lot of the stuff couldn't see invisible so far, but when I did find something that could see invisible (I was con'ing everything to see) I turned and ran back to the zone and zoned back to town.  I told him that he was on his own, and even a guildmate of his in Icewell was sending me tells asking me to help.  I couldn't, and they were just getting plain annoying.  So I kept telling them that I couldn't, and they would kill me in moments if I tried being their bodyguard.  Those things quad for 270's!!  They both ended up calling me rude. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :/ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":/"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   So I can't remember the other person's name and all.<br><br>Well, that's my story.

I know I've already run into plenty of good people from your guild.

It would be called &quot;Super Chamcham's Super Worshipping Fan Club Shrine&quot;.  To start, I'd hunt down people like Sarkam, Bradilar, Elnots, Darkwen, Curyldewi, Reviver, Cyke, Namcidem, Capper, and Valrus to become the initial members.  There's no escaping me, you'll all become part of the most superior guild in the world!  You'll all become my slaves!!  All hail Chamcham, queen of all eternity!

My brother is a rogue who just finished getting RavenScale armor. Baboonga asked him if he would trade the Ravenscale for a set of Shadow Knight armor. Obviously my brother said no and ended the conversation. Well, this guy decided to inspect my brother over and over again, which gets annoying after a very short time.<br><br>I ran into him myself in WC at the druid ring. I had just gotten a GhoulBane from a guildmate (yipee!) when I see this guy coming my way.

I figure hey, what the hell. Well, I get to lfay/MM zone, and he starts having me put stuff in the window. I put a few, he cancels, runs at me, then says let me see more, and then says to me. Oh, put more in there, waht else do you have I want to compare. So we do this about 3 times and   the third time it's full. I backup get some distance. Made sure my inventory would take  the items back as well. Sure enough, a second later he cancels and rushes me. <br><br>Well, he then asks to see the crescent blades and how much damage he can do. I kindly refuse, and ask him  why he isn't wearing it all. He tells me it is on his 59 enchanter, and he can't get it right now. Whish is odd, cause why would a rogue not wear myrlo if he had it and instead let it rot on his chanter? Then his mother supposedly has to use the computer and goes LD, an hour and a half later he comes back. <br><br>Then he asks me if I can let him use the crescent's and  when his doctor friend who got called into work comes back, whom now had the myrlo gear &lt;not his 59 chanter&gt;, he will give me the gear AND Gauntlets of Firey Might.
