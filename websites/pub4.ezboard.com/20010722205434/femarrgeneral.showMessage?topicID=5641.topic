Unfortunately, it can also be a painful class. Twisting songs has become close to impossible for me, due to the shooting pains that run up my arm. Sigh. A bard who can't twist songs, shouldn't play.<br>

I was getting to the part of the game to which I was always looking forward, namely the endgame of plane raids and epic encounters. I am sorry to say that I have never killed a dragon, nor a god. I will miss that.<br>
<br>
I am hopeful that I will be able to redesign my keyboard layout, and find a remedy for my arm. (Hey, if Def Leppard can have  one armed drummer, maybe I can be a one armed bard.) If so, and if it does not take to long, I look forward to seeing all my friends in EQ again. In the meantime, I am likely to be absent, although I still read the boards.<br>

I have gotten files, done research, etc. It never occurred to me to look for information on carpal tunnel syndrom.<br>
<br>
Anyway, the good news is that it definately is not a problem with carpal tunnel. The symptoms match a different nerve being compressed, one on the inside of my elbow. It seems that the way I have my keyboard set up at work has required me to sit with my arms on a hard desk surface and this has compressed a nerve, causing pain and numbness. I have changed this setup, and I'll see if it helps. Thanks everyone, I would hate to have to quit while I am still having fun.<br>
<br>
With luck, I'll be back to EQ in a week or two. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>Ziktiny Totenstille<br>

<br>
I have always loved the bard class and after getting bored with my Druid it seemed natural for me to start a bard.<br>
<br>
However, after 40 levels, including some serious charm-kiting in OT my hands and fingers really started to cramp up.<br>
<br>
It got so bad that I could hardly type which is not good considering I use a computer all day as well. It eventually caused me to give up Eq for a couple of months.<br>
<br>
After a few weeks my hands got back in shape, thanks mainly to some serious stretching of hands, elbow and shoulders at least twice a day.<br>
<br>
When I came back the pains had gone but I was very wary of playing my bard again so I got my shaman and warrior up to 51 instead.<br>
<br>
A couple of months ago I went back to my bard for a short while and it was some of the best fun I have had in EQ for a long while.<br>
<br>
Sadly, I took it for granted that my hands would be fine again as I had stopped the stretching exercises after the pain had receeded the first time.<br>
<br>
Boy was I wrong. After a week of twisting the pain was back worse than ever. I have now decided that my health is worth more than my bard and even though it has bought me close to quitting again I have now retired him for good.<br>
<br>
The moral is that you can get around the problem. There is a lot of information on the web showing exercises and stretches that do work to cure the pain. However, do not take it for granted that once you have cured it you will not suffer again. <br>
<br>
When you come back to playing your bard make sure that you keep up with the stretches and do not push yourself if you start to get a twinge again. Inform your group that your hands are aching so that they do not expect you to twist during downtime as much. It is amazing what a minutes rest now and again with some stretching of the hands and arms can do to relieve the pain.<br>
<br>
I sincerely hope that you manage to resolve the problem and that you have a long and happy future with your bard. After all they are the coolest class around.<br>

It it MUCH better IMHP that your table is about even with arm rests on the chair, or maybe even a little higher. Also, slideing the keyboard away to your left down the table to keep your wrists strait helps alot also. When I played at a friends house sometimes I would notice that my wrists and arms start to hurt because his chair was very low, and the keyboard was very close to the edge of the desk. This causes you to continusily hold your arms up, and your wrists are pressed aginst the edge of the desk. <br>
<br>
See if you can slide your desk a little farther away from the wall so you can back your moniter up, to slide your keyboard farther up also. <br>
<br>
I have allways thought that them eurgo-Keyboards were ghey looking, but they might be sometihng for you to look at if your feeling pain. <br>
<br>
<br>
Don't let it hut you. <br>
<br>
<br>
I hope some of this can help some of you. <br>

I started to have it mildly a couple of months ago, but then I started doing yoga classes. (if you have ever thought of doing yoga, go! it is great) After a month of yoga most of my problems were gone, and not just the problems in my wrists, but my knee quit bothering me too.<br>
<br>
Anyway I have slacked off in my yoga classes and pratice at home (bad Nick) and I am experiencing some really bad pains in my left wrist (which is the hand that issues all my eq commands) So streching does help, but make sure it is good streching. Make sure you aren't just playing around and claiming that you strech.<br>
<br>
Yoga is a very good injury recovery and prevent injury excersie. When you do a sport you train certian muscles to do certian things, but at the same time you are neglecting muscles and you are getting tight in other areas. Yoga teaches you how to strech the muscles you use and the ones you don't inorder to be more plyable and give a little more give and take in your body so you are less likely to really injur yourself badly. <br>
<br>
A great book is  Power Yoga by (can't remeber her first name but it starts with a B) Bender. Wonderful book, after reading it I bought 10 copies and gave them out as gifts. <br>

Wrist problems with computers are caused when you have a lot of repetetive wrist movements.  Lesten the amount that you are actively changing wrist position, and you won't have as many problems.  Also, excersizing that wrist is extremely important (and no i don't mean the excersizing you might do with the sears catalogue, hehe).<br>
<br>
Pushups, and various other excersizes are very good for your wrists, and if you do martial arts you'll get a very good workout on those wrists.<br>
<br>
It may take awhile for your wrists to heal, but provided you treat them right it's possible.<br>

But I didn't think anyone would want to hear the explanition on how it does that. However yoga, when you really do yoga and not just play with it, (I will admitt i was palying with it, but now I am doing yoga) is a great way to increase the overall health of your life. If you add it to your routine as a supplemnt to your current sports/activities you willfind that you increase your ability to do your sports better and faster than you ever have and you move your breaking point further and further away. I actually got my hubby to try this to help him with all his knee and ankle problems from marathon running. Let me tell you how hard it was to convince him to do that &lt;GRIN&gt; I had to tell him it would increase our sex life with all the new interesting postions. God men are easy to con.<br>

Oh remebered the womans name...Beryl bender Birch. Power Yoga the Total Strength and Flexibility Workout. It is a form of astanga yoga. There are many different forms such as everything in life, but this is the one i like best. <p>Nickle Ante<BR>
