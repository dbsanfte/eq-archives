Prelude: Lukaria's Ascenscion<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lukaria knelt for her evening prayers in the chapel of light Tunare.  Tonight she prayed for safety and a quick return for her love, Hamuro, who on this very day began a perilous quest.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp As she prayed, a figure appeared in front of her, her robes pure white and gave off a radiance of its own.  Her face was smooth and soft and beauty radiated from her.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Lukaria, my child,&quot; Tunare spoke to her, smiling, but there was something in her voice that caught Lukaria's attention.  Worry, and possibly fear.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Tunare, Mother, what is wrong, why is it that you come here tonight?&quot;  Lukaria said reaching out her hand as if to comfort Tunare.  Tunare took Lukaria's hand in her own with a caressing touch.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Come with me Lukaria, there is much that you yet do not know, and not much time to tell you.  There is a great battle coming, and i do not mean the war that is coming here on Norrath, yet they are one and the same.&quot;  Lukaria looked at Tunare bewildered, her eys fell upon Tunare with confusion.  <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Where are we going?&quot; she asked.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;To where the gods walk, to where the gods wage war, to the realm of the gods.&quot; Tunare answered, the smile fading from her face, and she became very serious, &quot;Will you join us?  Will you help us wage war against the gods of evil?&quot;<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;I will.&quot;  Lukaria answered.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Then come with me, your training begins now.&quot;  Tunare spoke, and pulled Lukaria into her arms and together they vanished from the world of mortals, from Norrath forever.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp CHAPTER 1: Darkness Falls<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rorouni sat down, more fell than sat, he was exhausted from his battle with the Sarnak's at the Lake of Ill Omen.  He then heard a sound from behind him, he turned to look and saw a black mailed fist strieking for his head, he had no time to move out of the way.  The blow from the fist knocked him unconcious.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp When he woke up he looked around, he found himself in some type of prison cell and he heard voices coming form outside, one, an older persons voice that almost sounded familiar. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Is the spike ready for him?&quot;  The older voice said.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Yes Sir, the spike is ready.&quot;  Replied another voice.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Place him on it.&quot;  The older mans voice said.  Now Rorouni could see outside his cell and caught glimpses of who was talking outside.  The older one appeared to be wearing armor as black as night.  Then the cell door opened and rorouni was removed from the cell, and taken to a place where he was strapped into a lowering mechanism and was floted above the spike, he was then lowered to the tip of the spike.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Why are you doing this?&quot;  Rorouni screamed as he was being lowered, only laughter responded his cries.  Once at the tip of the spike the ropes that held him up were released, and Rorouni plummeted onto the spike, his own weight driving the spike deeper into his stomach.  His body stopped sliding down the spike about half way down, his screams echoed through the chamber.  A hand gripped his chin and forced his head up, and Rorouni stared into the old man's face, disbelief in his eyes.  &quot;Why?&quot;  he spoke, barely able to summon the strength to say that one word.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;You are my proof of loyalty to Bertoxxulous, enjoy the rest of your pitiful life.&quot;  The older man dressed in the black armor spoke, then laughed malicously.  His laughter echoed through the champer and into the corridors of Bertoxxulous's Fortress.  Bertoxxulous himself, sitting in his personal chambers smiled.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;You have done well for yourself, and have almost proved to me that you are truely sincere about joining me and my cause.  Don't you think Lady T'Vyl?&quot;  Bertoxxulous spoke to the man wearing the black armor, glancing behind him as Lanys T'Vyl entered the room.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Indeed my Lord, he has, but i told you that when he first came to us.&quot; Lanys responded, she walked up to the man in the black armor.  The man was very short in stature, with a long beard detailing his face, a Dwarf.  Lanys put her arms around the dwarf and kissed him on the lips.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;You did indeed Lanys, but i have one more test for you.  This test if you pass will prove to me that you have truely forsaken your past and all those who belong to it.&quot;  Bertoxxulous spoke, ignoring Lanys's activities with the dwarf.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;I will do as you command my Lord.&quot;  The dwarf spoke.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;You will capture, and bring to me alive one whom you had for so long considered a close friend of yours.  Bring to me the Half-Elf Ranger known as Lillia.&quot;<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Yes, my Lord.&quot;  The dwarf turned and left Bertoxxulous's chambers and smiled, the smile of an evil mind at work setting a trap.  As his plan's came together in his mind as he walked out of the Fortress and entered the lands of Norrath.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Back in his chamber Bertoxxulous watched the dark figure of the dwarf fade into the darkness, then turned to Lanys T'Vyl, &quot;This Hamuro of yours interests me, a Paladin, turned Dark Paladin, this has never happened on Norrath before.  I sence the tides shifting my way, as they did on the planet Draxxul, i had an army of dark Paladins there.&quot;<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;I have to admitt myself that his turn is hard to believe, but his gift to me was, quite extraordinary.  If i may ask my Lord, why did you send him on this as a test.&quot;  Lanys said.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;I need to know if he will be capable of what i would like him to do later on.  If he handles this in such a way, everything will fall into our hands just the way we planned it.&quot;  Bertoxxulous responded to her.<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Chapter 2: The Darkness Grows<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lillia entered the front door to the Guild Hall and saw Esperanza almost immediately.  &quot;Any word on or from Hamuro?&quot;  Esperanza asked Lillia.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;No, i'm afraid not, i couldn't find a trace of him.  Not even his daughter knows where he has gone.&quot;  Lillia sadly responded to Esperanza.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;It isn't like him to be gone this long without any word.  I am worried that something horrible has happened to him.&quot;  Esperanza said, then walked out of the Hall.  Lillia continued to head back to her room.  <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lillia entered her room and went to lay down on the bed, she had been out looking for any kind of sign of hamuro to no avail, many members of the guild had begun to start to worry about him just as Esperanza was worried about him.  A silver glint coming from a desk in her room then caught her eye.  She walked over to see what it was and saw that it was a note sealed with some type of shiny silver material.  She opened the note and read it.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Dear Lillia,<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I know you have not heard from me in some time now, i have found something that i &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp would like you to see, come to the statue on the river near Firiona Vie, come alone, &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp don't tell anyone.  I need your help with a surprise for the guild, so i beg you not to &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp tell anyone.  After you read this note please set it in a fire proof area and the silver &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp material found on the seal will consume this note in flames.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Your Dear Friend,<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hamuro&quot;<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lillia through the letter into the fire-place and the letter immediately burst into flames.  That very day Lillia set out for Firiona Vie.  Two days later she stood beneath the statue on the river in Firiona Vie, alone, and she waited for Hamuro to appear.  No sooner did she sit down than she heard a voice behind her, &quot;Hello old friend.&quot;  Hamuro said with a smile on his face.  <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;HAMURO!!!&quot;  Lillia leaped up and hugged the old dwarf almost strangling him in her arms.  &quot;It is so good to see you again.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;And you Lillia, i have missed you greatly.&quot;<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;So what is it that you need my help with?&quot;  Lillia asked.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Come, i will show you.&quot; Hamuro answered, he turned away and smiled to himself.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;That is a new look for you Hamuro.&quot;  Lillia commented as they walked up-stream.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;I Happened along it as i traveled, it is rather good armor, and it fits me well.  Ah, here we are.&quot;  As they rounded the bend in the river and went behind a large rock they came to their destination.  There on the ground lay the body of a man, who appeared to be dead.  Lillia knelt down to the body to get a closer look at who it might be and to see if he was still alive.  She never got that far, as she began to bend over she felt a sharp pain to the back of her neck and she collapsed to the ground, she looked back around to see her assailant and only had time to see a black gauntleted fist coming to her face.  Her jaw made a sickening sound as it snapped and broke from the blow to her face, and she fell to the ground unconscious.  The last thing she remembered thinking was, &quot;Why, Hamuro, why?&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lillia awoke to find herself shackled to a wall, she was in some kind of prison cell, it was dark inside the cell, and she could tell there was not much room in this cell, barely enough to stand in and she did so.  Lillia pulled herself up to her full height and found the the tip of her head touched the ceiling.  The room was lit by only one source of light, a small barred window in what looked from what light came through to be a door.  She slowly moved forward toward the door, then the pain hit her.  She tried to cry out in the pain but just using her jaw to open her mouth sent pain coursing through her body.  She then realized that her jaw was broben in 4 places, even though she could not move her jaw, she did let out moans of pain.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Ah, the half-breed is awake.&quot;  Spoke a voice that was so familiar to her.  &quot;Heal her jaw, i want to be able to hear her screams.&quot;<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp With those words a man entered her cell and placed his hands on her head and a rush of rejuvinating energy coursed through her and her jaw became whole once again.  When the cleric had finished he left the tiny cell and closed the door behind him.  Lillia pulled herself up to the door of the cell and took her first look out of the cell.  Almost as soon as she looked out she turned and hurried back to a corner of the room and wretched.  <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The door opened again and a dwarf dressed in jet black armor stepped in.  Hamuro reached down and the chains that help Lillia to the wall, in one hand, in the other he put a key to the wall where the chains were fastened.  The chains came undone from the wall and he help Lillia by the wrists where the chains were shackled to her. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;help me Hamuro,&quot; She said weakly.  Hamuro responded by pulling her by the chains out of the cell.  <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp There just outside her cell was a large iron spike, blood stained the metal on the top half of the spike.  From the point of the spike it widened as it went down.  Lillia averted her eyes from the gruesome sight near the base of the spike, but Hamuro grabbed her by the chin and forced her to look.  &quot;This is the price of opposing Lord Bertoxxulous and Lady T'Vyl, and the price of standing in my way.&quot;  At the base of the spike was what looked to be a Wood Elf male, he was laying on his stomoch impaled by the spike, the spike making a hole in his back almost large enough to cut him in two.  <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp What made this sight even worse for Lillia was that she knew who this unfortunate Wood Elf was, Rorouni, member of the Champions of Marr, a guild whose the hope of all of Norrath stood.  Hamuro leaned down to take Rorouni by the chin, bringing Lillia down with him.  As he lifted the chin a moan escaped Rorouni's lips.  &quot;Still alive are we?&quot;  Hamuro stated coldly, and Rorouni spit in his face.  Hamuro let go of Lillia's chin and she fell to the floor and there she wretched again.  &quot;In your position Rorouni, the slightest weight upon your back will kill you.&quot;  With that Hamuro placed his pinky on the back of Rorouni between his shoulder.  rorouni tried to scream but only gurgled up blood, and then even that ceased as the top half of his body slid off the spike, completely severed from the lower half of his body.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hamuro turned to face Lillia and as she looked up at him, he smiled, a cruel wicked smile.  &quot;Shall i have you go through the same fate?&quot;  Hamuro took off his glove and touched the tip of the spike with his finger, and then held it out in front of Lillia, &quot;Sharp, shall it pierce your soft, smooth skin?&quot;  Hamuro got up and pulled her up with him.  &quot;No, unfortunately Bertoxxulous needs you alive.  There is no escape for you,&quot;  Hamuro then led her to a man that had to be the one in charge of this dungeon and spoke to him in harsh tones, &quot;Strip her, flay her skin with the whips and beat her until she passes out, then heal her wounds just enough so that they stop bleeding and let her regain consciousness in her cell, then start over again.  Keep doing this untill i tell you to stop.&quot;<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lillia looked into Hamuro's eyes with a horrifying look in her own, she tried to see any compassion in his eyes, any sign of the Hamuro who she used to know, the Hamuro she had called a friend not two days ago.  She found nothing there in his eyes, just cold, cruel, hatred and evil burned in his eyes.  &quot;Why Hamuro, why?&quot; she said to him as he began to walk away.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hamuro half turned his head to her and said, &quot;A great game of chess is about to begin, all the pieces must be put in place before it can begin.&quot;  <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lillia screamed as they began to rip the clothes off her body, leaving her naked.  she screamed again and again as the whip cracked over her body, and between her cries of pain she heard laughter from the man whom she had called friend.  Deep, twisted, and evil laughter belowed out of Hamuro as he turned his back and began to walk out of the room.  His laughter echoed through the chamber, it echoed through the corridors.<br>

<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hamuro knelt in the Great Hall of Bertoxxulous's Fortress, he knelt in front of Bertoxxulous himself, with Lady Lanys T'Vyl standing not too far behind Lord Bertoxxulous.  &quot;Rise Hamuro,&quot;  Bertoxxulous's coice boomed through the Hall, &quot;You have done well for yourself and proven yourself to me that you are worthy of joining my elite forces.&quot;<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Wait, my Lord.&quot;  A man also dressed in black armor shouted as he entered the Great Hall,  he wlaked up and kneeled before Lord Bertoxxulous then rose again and spoke.  &quot;This Dwarf Paladin cannot be trusted.  So he captured two of his old friends, this does not prove that his heart is truely evil, surely you can sence it my Lord.&quot;<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;I sence nothing but evil from the heart of this dwarf.&quot;  Bertoxxulous replied.  &quot;General Tyros, he has earned my trust, that should be enough for you as well.&quot;<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Without warning Hamuro stood and through his fist into the Generals stomach, the General gasped in surprise as Hamuro's hand penetrated his armor and into his body.  &quot;Let this be a testiment of the evil that lies in my own heart.&quot;  Hamuro said and then reached his arm up into the chest cavaty of the General, up intil his fist clenched around the Generals heart, &quot;As well as a testiment of your failure to Lord Bertoxxulous.&quot;  Hamuro's hand clenched tightly around the heart of the General and he squeezed together as tightly as he could until everyone in the room heard the sound of his heart bursting.  General Tyros crumpled to the floor convulsing as Hamuro's fist came out of the hole in the General's stomach, still holding the crushed heart.  Hamuro threw the remains of the heart to the floor next to the crumpled general's body.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lord Bertoxxulous smiled, &quot;You are now my Black Knight, come with me, i will lay out your task for you now.&quot;  As he turned around to leave the Great Hall, Lanys T'Vyl walked up to Hamuro, put her arms around him and kissed him sweetly and fully.  Then, arm in arm Hamuro and Lanys followed Lord Bertoxxulous into his ante-chamber.  &quot;Hamuro, General Gorndax Dragondorf, he is the single person on Norrath that can stand in my way to complete victory.  His military prowess is well known and well respected, i even grudgingly admit by myself.  I need him out of the way.&quot;<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Then i will go and kill him.....&quot; Hamuro started to say but Bertoxxulous interrupted him.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;No, i want him alive, i want you to capture him, and bring him back here, use that half-breed as bait.&quot;<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hamuro smiled, &quot;I have a better idea sir, and will get rid of another obstacle to you as well.&quot;<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;I'm listening.&quot;<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;She is what holds that fragile alliance together to begin with, remover her from the picture, who i can then better use to trap Gorndax and pull him here without much trouble.&quot;  Hamuro started.  As he continued on with his plan, Bertoxxulous and Lanys both smiled, as they new that with this they were sure to win.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;So then, i will need a human female, that knows how to play musical instruments, one that can be molded and shaped to look exactly like her, with one excepting, instead of that of a pure heart of goodness, she will have a dark heart of evil.&quot;  Hamuro finished.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;All will be ready for you when you return.&quot;  Bertoxxulous.<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp * * * * * <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lillia lifted her head from the floor of the cell, and then the pain returned to her.  For the last two days her flesh had been ripped apart from head to two by the whips, only to be healed up again and again so that they could start all over again.  She heard a sound at the door and she pretended to be still unconscious, then she heard that voice again. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Don't worry my dear, a dear friend of yours will be joining you soon, and when she is here, all hope for Norrath will end.&quot;  Hamuro laughed deeply and vilely as he turned and left her there in the cell, and there she wept.<br>

<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Esperanza traveled through the Commonlands on her way to Kithicor Forest.  She traveled to Highhold Keep for a meeting of the War Council, but she traveled with a heavy heart and a mind burdened with three missing Champions of Marr.  The first one was a long time friend, Hamuro, it has been five weeks since his disappearance, how could he be so cruel as to not even send any or leave any word.  The second missing member was Rorouni, he was last seen at the Sarnak Fort near the Lake of Ill Omen, no one has seen or heard from him for about a week now.  The third missing member is one that also weighs heavily on her, three days ago she left the Guild Hall without a word to anyone, she has not been seen since.  She feels that what is happening to Lillia now is what happened to Hamuro.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp With all these thoughts, she also had the responsibility of keeping the fragile alliance of guild and races from all across Norrath together.  And with all this running through her mind she did not even notice that she had come to the edge of the forest of Kithicor and she stopped in her tracks and looked around.  &quot;Dammit Esperanza you are going to get yourself killed if you don't start paying more attention.&quot; She scolded herself.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Yes you will, old friend.&quot; came a voice from the edge of the woods.  Esperanza looked at where the voice came from, wonder on her face, and she began moving at a quick pace to where the voice came from.  Just inside the forest was a small alcove, where sat a dwarf dressed in jet black armor.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;HAMURO!!!!&quot;  Esperanza said in astonishment and then ran to him and hugged him.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Esper, i have news about Lillia.&quot;  He spoke after she released him from her arms.  &quot;She was supposed to meet me three days ago, i was attacked once i got close to our meeting point and i got there just in time to see agents of Bertoxxulous carry her off.  I managed to follow them to where they took her.&quot;<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Where did they take her hamuro?&quot;  Esperanza asked.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Inside His Fortress.  I believe they plan to kill her very soon now too.  Will you come with me and help me get her out, i couldn't do it by myself, i need your help, your abilities can get us in and out without a trace.  I know how to get back there, i just can't get to Lillia.&quot;  hamuro spoke those last with tears streaking down his face.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Lets go and get more from the guild to help....&quot; Esperanza began, but Hamuro interrupted her.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;No, we don't have the time, by the time we get others and head back to Bertoxxulous's Fortress Lillia may already be dead.  Time is not on our side and it is running out, we must go now, or never.&quot;<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Lead the way then, Hamuro.&quot;  <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hamuro led Esperanza farther into the forest, they came up to a large tree made of some kind of black wood, Ebony, a kind of wood found rarely in any of the forests of Norrath.  Hamuro went up to the trunk of the tree and then proceeded to walk through it.  Esperanza looked at it in confusion and then followed Hamuro quickly.  When they stepped out on the other side they found themselves in a darkly lit tunnel that continued straight ahead.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;This is a tunnel that leads underneath the Fortress, this will take us to the dungeon that they were keeping Lillia in, follow me.&quot;  Hamuro spoke in a whisper.  He led her through the corridor which made only two turns and then ended in a dead end, but Hamuro pressed on a plate on the wall and the wall opened up into a small chamber.  &quot;This is the first room that we must go through to enter the dungeon, once through here we are in the dungeon.&quot;<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Esperanza used her abilities to make them both invisible and they continued on through the room and they entered the dungeon.  To their surprise there were no guards, no others in the dungeon save for the prisoners, which at this time there was only one, Lillia, who they could hear moaning in pain from one of the cells, they quickly found her and with a little work Esperanza had the door open.  Tears filled her eyes when she looked upon the mass that lay huddled on the floor and she went immediately to Lillia side.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Lillia, is that really you?&quot;<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Esperanza!, how did you get here?&quot;  Lillia asked looking into Esperanza's eyes.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Hamuro brought me here, he...&quot;<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;NO, get out, it is a trap.&quot; Lillia said to her, just then the door to the cell slammed shut and the door relocked.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Esperanza stood and ran to the door and saw Hamuro standing there with the keys in his hand, smiling.  &quot;Hamuro, what are you doing, get us out of here.&quot;<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hamuro laughed, &quot;Esperanza, that was all too easy.  You are too predictable, you didn't even think about what i told you, just took it to be truth just because it came from someone you used to know.&quot; <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hamuro then shouted, &quot;Jylez, strip her, we will need all of her items and armor in tact.  Tell Syremon that his model is here.&quot;<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Why Hamuro, why are you doing this?&quot;  Esperanza shouted at him.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hamuro turned to face her, &quot;The great game of chess is about to begin, more pieces need to be placed in preparation.&quot;  He then turned his back on her and walked out of the dungeon.  Esperanza sand to the floor next to Lillia, tears streaming down her cheeks, that wasn't the Hamuro that she had called a friend.  The door to the cell was opened again and three men came in and began striping her of all her belongings, her weapons, her instruments, and her armor were all removed, leaving her completely naked, just as naked as Lillia was laying next to her.  Then after the three men had left another man came in and picked up Lillia, shortly later the screams began again and Esperanza huddled in the corner of the cell, naked, with tears falling from her face.  She jumped with every sound of the whip cracking against flesh and then the sound of of Lillia screaming in pain.<br>

<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Well, Lukaria, we apologize for throughing you into things like this, i wish we had much more time to train you.&quot;  Tunare spoke to Lukaria apologetically, &quot;but i think now that you can see the desparation that we face here.  Our forces are on their heels, trying to hold, but things don't look good, Bertoxxulous and Lanys T'Vyl have gained a distinct advantage and their power continues to grow.&quot;<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;I will do what i can to help, I do see your plight here.  You have shown me some of the ropes of this place of where I will be fighting and what it is we are fighting to protect.  You have also shown me some of the powers i am now capable of as well, being a goddess is new to me, but i will do my best with my abilities.&quot;  Lukaria reassured Tunare, but Tunare just started to cry.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Things are even worse than you know, we have been betrayed on Norrath, by one that we had held in high respect for his dealings with Lanys T'Vyl and Innoruuk, and with his own daughter.&quot;  Tunare spoke through her tears, &quot;Hamuro has now become a Dark Paladin.  It is a rare occurance for something of this nature to happen, it has never before happened on Norrath, but dangerous.  A Dark Paladin is more powerful than anything else on Norrath, it is believed that Shadow Knights are the anti-Paladins, but they only scratch the surface of the power of a Dark Paladin.  On the planet of Draxxul, two hundred Paladins turned anti-paladin and with their combined power decimated the forces of good on that planet within hours.  Bertoxxulous won that planet in a complete route of our forces there, that was the beginning of the balance shifting to his favor.&quot;<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;I don't believe that Hamuro has forsaken the Light and become evil, it is not his way.&quot;  Lukaria spoke. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Then look and see for yourself, let your own eyes view his own actions.&quot;  Tunare returned.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lukaria opened up what looked to be a window out of the thin air, she was looking into a dungeon, the dungeon of Bertoxxulous's Fortress.  Hamuro stood there wearing midnight black armor, a change for him, he was looking into a cell at a woman whom she recognized.  &quot;Esperanza.&quot;  Lukaria gasped, and then listened as Hamuro began to speak.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;So, what are you going to do with me now that you have me here, Hamuro?&quot;  Esperanza spoke.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;My dear Esperanza, you should be thanking me for having you here, at least here you will not be used and lied to, back out there that is all they do to you, i didn't dare say anything then.  Here i will use you, but i am going to tell you how i am going to use you.  You see, you are my bait for capturing General Gorndax.&quot;  Hamuro spoke coldly, another change in him that Lukaria noticed.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;So you intend to trade me for Gorndax.&quot;<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hamuro smiled, &quot;In some areas you are very smart.&quot;  An Esperanza looked daggers at Hamuro.  Hamuro returned the look, &quot;Jylez, i don't think i like the way that she is looking at me, bring her out here.&quot;<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Jylez opened the cell door and two men went in and dragged Esperanza out of the cell and shackled her to a table.  &quot;Her eyes offend me, which one should i pluck out?&quot; Jylez and the others laughed.  <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lukaria looked on in horror as Hamuro plunged his fingers into Esperanza's right eye, she screamed as Hamuro dug out her eye with his own hand, the guards held her down.  The screams continued and then Hamuro brought his hand up holding what was left of Esperanza's right eye.  Lukaria sank to the ground choking on her tears.  Esperanza's screams of pain still filled the air, and Tunare closed the window and the screams stopped, but not in her head.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;And what does Brell Serilis have to say about the betrayal of one of his own champions.&quot;  Lukaria choked out angrily.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Brell has been secluded for some time now, almost from about the time this all began with Hamuro.  No one has been able to speak with him since.&quot;  Tunare responded.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Then by all the gods we shall go have a little chat with Brell Serilis.&quot;  Lukaria screamed.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;You wished a word with me?&quot;  A man's voice came from the entrance of the chamber, Brell Serilis walked forward, calmly.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;What do you have to say for yourself Brell, your champion has turned against you.&quot;  Lukaria spat.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Easy child, you may be one of us but you do not yet fully understand our ways.  That is why I am here, to make you understand what is going on, and why it is doing so.  Now sit and listen, your true lessons of godhood begin now.&quot;  Brell spoke. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;There is a reason for everything that is happenning now, i tell you these things now because you must take my place in watching over things for me, i will need all my powers to do what i have to do next.&quot;<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lukaria sat and listened, she bowed her head as understanding filled her.  A single tear fell from her eye.<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Esperanza lay asleep in the cell she shared with Lillia, Lillia was again unconscious from the beatings and whippings she had recieved not an hour ago.  Lillia's screams still echoed in Esperanza's head, Lillia's pain was added to the throbbing of her missing eye.  <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Esperanza.&quot;  A woman's angelic voice pierced the haze of her pain, and the dream began.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Esperanza looked up at the woman who had spoken her name, Lukaria stepped out from the shadows and into the light.  &quot;Esperanza, i know the pain you go through, unfortunately i cannot give you all the answers, i don't have the time.  All i can tell you is this, Hamuro is fighting for good, no matter what it may look like, he is still on our our side.  When the time comes he will need your help, trust him, i beg this of you, the fate of more than just Norrath rides on his shoulders.  Now i must go, my time here has ended, trust him esperanza, good-bye.&quot;<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Esperanza opened her eye, a tear streaming down her cheek, her missing eye no longer hurt, and for the first time in months Esperanza had hope, a hope she shared with Lillia when she woke.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp * * * * *<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Betrayed,&quot;  Gorndax spat and threw the letter on the table in front of Thayana, who picked it up and read it for himself.  &quot;And what is worse it is by one of our own.&quot;<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;I don't understand why Hamuro would turn to Bertoxxulous and join his forces.  Then to capture first Rorouni, then Lillia and then Esperanza, this makes no sence to me.  What will you do General?&quot;  Thayana asked.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Call a meeting of the Champions, and call the war council together, i will make known then what i will do.&quot;<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Thayana left the room and began to summon the war council and the Champions of Marr together.  Eight hours later General Gorndax addressed them all in the Great Hall of the Champions.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;As you all know, Esperanza failed to make it to the last meeting of the War Council.  Esperanza has been captured by an agent of Bertoxxulous.  That agent was also a member of our very own guild.  Hamuro holds Esperanza hostage, he has offered me an axchange, me for Esperanza.  Hamuro also holds Lillia captive, if i do not offer myself for exchange, he will kill Lillia and Esperanza.  And so i will go, i will offer myself in exchange for Esperanza.&quot;<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The room errupted into chaos.  <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Why would Hamuro do such a thing?&quot;<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Who will lead us?&quot;<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Who will lead the armies?&quot;<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Gorndax shouted, &quot;Quiet, please, i will have quiet.&quot;  The room immediately became quiet.  &quot;Anyone can lead the armies against the forces of Bertoxxulous.  But Esperanza is the heart of this alliance, without her everything we have fought for so long and hard will crumble to ashes.  So tomorrow i will meet with Hamuro at the edge of the Kithicor Forest.  Be there with me, to show that we stand as one against the forces of evil.&quot;<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Gorndax stepped down and left the room.  For long moments the room remained silent, then everyone slowly began to file out of the chamber.  Until only five remained in the room.  Kharne, Hakko, Adrena, Dinsk, and Mortulin all sat facing each other in silence.  Kharne was the first to break the silence.  &quot;It would appear that truely dark times have fallen upon us and evil is standing at our back door.&quot;<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;What are we going to do about this?&quot;  Hakko asked.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;I say we follow Hamuro and Gorndax back to wherever it is that Hamuro will take him,&quot;  Adrena said.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;We can then break Lillia and Gorndax out from wherever hamuro is holding them.&quot;  Mortulin added.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Lillia,&quot; Kharne thought to himself, &quot;I will get you out of there, no matter what it costs me&quot;<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;So, we are agreed, we will wait in hiding when Hamuro meets with Grondax and the rest of us, and after the exchange we follow them.&quot;  Dinsk confirmed the plan with them all.  Then they each in turn nodded to each other and left the room.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp * * * * * <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Morning rose in the dark forest of Kithicor, the rays of sunlight just beginning to penetrate the foliage of the forest as the sun rose over the hills of the Western Commonlands.  The sunlight glinted off of Hamuro's black armor, and then off of the deep blue armor of Esperanza as they both waited along with five other soldiers from Bertoxxulous's Fortress at the edge of the forest.  Across from them stood the ranks of General Gorndax's forces, forty Champions of Marr stood behind their fearless leader.  Gorndax began to walk forward and Hamuro made a motion behind him, two guards brought out a sack, and walked to the forces of the Champions, &quot;If you attempt to follow us, this is all that will remain of Lillia when you get to her.&quot;  Hamuro shouted and the two guards unrolled the bag and Rorouni came out of it and slammed to the ground.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hamuro then turned to Esperanza as Gorndax reached the halfway point, &quot;Go to your people.&quot;  Esperanza then began to walk toward the Champions, as she passed Gorndax she gave him a grave look.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;It will be alright Esper,&quot; Gorndax said to her.  They then continued on their ways.  Once Gorndax reached Hamuro he was disarmed then bound and gagged and then knocked unconscious.<br>
They then proceeded into the forest.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp At the same time Esperanza reached the Champions and Thayana stepped out to her, he began to cast one of his spells, after he had finished he looked at Esperanza, &quot;Wait, you are not Esperanza.&quot;  At that Esperanza unsheathed one of her blades and slashed Thayana across the chest, he fell to the ground, his life's blood flowing from his gaping wound.  Namcidem ran up to Thayana and as he crouched over him to pray for the powers of healing from his god Esperanza plunged her second blade into his back and Namcidem collapsed to the ground still conscious.  Esperanza turned with both blades in her hand as two more Champions came forward, Feyanna began to cast a spell but before she could finish Esperanza flung her dagger at Feyanna, the dagger plunged into Feyanna's throat and she gagged on her own blood and fell to the ground, dead.  Esperanza caught movement out of the corner of her eye and saw Emrystone trying to get behind her, she lunged at him, her attack much more powerful than his defense and Esperanza's blade sank into his heart.  She heard someone casting a spell behind her but when she turned around she found that she couldn't move, She had been stunned by Narvil.  Esperanza felt something heavy hit her from behind and then she collapsed.  Namcidem stood over her fallen form clutching his chest where her blade had gone through, because of his powers the bleeding had stopped and most of the damage from the wound had been repaired.  Thayana lay unconscious but no longer breathing, the essence of his life staining the ground, Feyanna lay dead Esperanza's dagger still plunged through her throat, and Emrystone lay dead as well.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Everyone else stood there in a daze, they still couldn't believe what had just happened.  They bound Esperanza and took her back to the Guild Hall, where they put her into a prison cell till they could figure out what the hell had just happened.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp * * * * *<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hakko led the way through the forest following Hamuro and his men, Kharne followed close behind with Adrena, Mortulin and Dinsk.  Suddenly Hamuro stopped, he turned around and seemed to look straight at Kharne.  Hamuro seemed to sigh, then spoke out loud, &quot;Kharne, why do you bottle up inside you your true self, why do you pretend to be good?  Let go, let your true nature again take its roots in you, be what it is in your nature to be.&quot;  Hamuro then turned and continued to walk on.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Ok, that was strange, how did he see ......... &quot;  Hakko began to say and then cut off suddenly as he began to spit blood.  He looked down to see the tip of a spear sticking through his chest.  Suddenly the spear was no longer there and her gurgled and spat up more blood as he fell to the ground, dead.  <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Adrena, Dinsk and Mortulin stood there in shock as they watched Kharne stab Hakko through the back, and as their companion fell, Kharne turned on them as well.  First he began to attack Adrena, his spear slicing into her arm,  Mortulin and Dinsk closed in on him and he was soon overpowered and brought down.  They bound him and made sure he could not reach any of his weapons. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;What the hell just happened?&quot;  Adrena almost shouted.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Hamuro must have done something to Kharne, some kind of spell.&quot;  Mortulin replied, &quot;Whatever it was, we now lost Hamuro's trail and any hope of rescueing Lillia and Gorndax.  We better head back, you two take care of Kharne, i will carry hakko back.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp * * * * *<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Back at the Guild Hall the bodies of Feyanna, Emrystone, and Thayanna were being prepared for burial as Mortulin walked in carrying Hakko, &quot;What happened?&quot;  Rocx asked as she looked upon the body of Hakko and shook her head, tears welling up in her eyes, not for the first time this night.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;I should ask the same here.&quot;  Mortulin responded, &quot;Adrena, Kharne, Dinsk, Hakko and I followed Hamuro to try to rescue Lillia and Gorndax.  Hamuro saw us somehow and must have cast some sort of spell on Kharne, Kharne pierced Hakko through the back and then attacked us.  Adrena and Dinsk are taking him down to the prison for holding until we can determine what happened to him and why.&quot;<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rocx began to visibly cry as she related what happened with Esperanza's return.  Mortulin laid Hakko's body with the others and then staggered out of the chapel.  That evening a service was held for the four champions who had died this day, many tears were shed that evening as darkness descended upon the land.  Rocx, who preformed the ceremony could barely make it through the ceremony herself.  Grief ripped through the hearts of all the Champions there, the grief of the loss of four members of their rank, three of whom once sat in the chair of an officer.  The worst grief of all, was the grief of betrayal, betrayal by Hamuro, betrayal by Esperanza, and betrayal by Kharne.<br>

This Cannot be.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Welcome to my fortress, General Gorndax Dragondorf.&quot;  Bertoxxulous said smiling standing from his throne in the Great Hall.  Gorndax stood in chains not ten feet from where Bertoxxulous stood smiling down at him.  <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;So what will you do with me now? Kill me?&quot;  Gorndax spat in defiance.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Oh, eventually you will be killed, but not before my purpose for you has come to an end.&quot;  Bertox replied to him calmly and then turned to Hamuro.  &quot;You have done well, My Black Knight, take this Dwarf to join with his companions, then return to me in my chambers, i have plans i wish to discuss with you.&quot;<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Yes, My Lord.&quot;  Hamuro spoke simply and quietly, then bowed and turned to lead Gorndax down to the dungeon.  Once to the Dungeon Hamuro took the keys from the prison master and took Gorndax to the same cell that held Gorndax's companions.  Hamuro then removed the chains from Gorndax, had his Armor taken and a robe given to him, then Hamuro opened the door to the cell and Gorndax looked in and saw two forms lying in the darkness.  Hamuro pushed Gorndax into the cell, closed and loked the door behind him.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Gorndax looked down and recognized one of the forms as Lillia, he knelt down next to her and found that she was awake, &quot;Lillia,&quot; Gorndax whispered, &quot;Are you alright?  No, i can tell that you are not, but at least you are alive.&quot;<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Gorndax?  Hamuro got you too?&quot;  She said weakly.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;In exchange for Esperanza yes.&quot;&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp   Hamuro laughed as he said that and Lillia began to cry.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Then you were tricked just as I was.  Esperanza is here.&quot;  Lillia said and pointed over to the other form lying on the floor, &quot;But i warn you, she has been harmed far mor than I have.&quot;<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Gorndax turned around and looked at the other body, he slowly began to turn her over and she turned the rest of the way without his help.  Gorndax gasped and began to cry, &quot;Erperanza!  Your eye?  What happened to you?&quot;<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;My eye offended him,&quot; she said looking out the small cell window at Hamuro, &quot;so he plucked it out.&quot;<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Without standing or turning Gorndax spoke to Hamuro, &quot;I swear on all that is good and holy, you will never again in this life set foot on the soil of Norrath Hamuro.&quot;  Hamuro laughed.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Make threats when it is I who is behind those bars.&quot;<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Gorndax put his arm around Esperanza and helped her into a sitting position.  &quot;It is alright Gorn,&quot; She said, &quot;I feel now like i can see better with one good eye, than i could with two.  Everything that has happened has been done for a reason, though it may not be apparant at this time, the reason is still out there.&quot;  Gorndax looked at Esperanza with a confused look on his face.  Esperanza put her head on his shoulder and whispered, &quot;you will understand when the time comes.&quot;<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Well Hamuro, it appears that you have tortured these two to no end, is this my fate as well?  Physical torture?  I can deal with that.&quot;<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Yes, i know you can.  That is why your torture will be a psycological one.&quot;  With that the cell door was opened and men came in and picked up both Esperanza and Lillia and took them out of the cell.  Moments later they both began to scream in pain and Gorndax ran up to the cell door to see what was happening.  &quot;You will not be tortured as they are, this is your torture, the fact that you have all your strength and yet you can do absolutely nothing while your friends are put through much pain, and all you can do is watch.&quot;  Hamuro then turned and left the chamber, the women's screams echoing after him, and he smiled. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;STOP IT, STOP IT DAMN YOU.&quot; <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp * * * * * <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Come in Hamuro, have a seat.&quot;  Lanys said, leading him to a padded couch where two could sit in comfort.  Bertoxxulous sat himself into a chair across from the couch.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Hamuro, you have done me well, and now it is time to fill you in on what i will need you to do next.  Which is how i am going to win this war as well.  Already my forces march on Norrath and soon full scale war will break out.  Thanks to you and your well thought out tactics you have left our most dangerous oponent weak in its command staff.  There is also an underlying reason that i wanted all three of them here alive.  In one days time i will open a rift into the plane of Charbidos, the Plane of the Demons, and i will form a pact with the demons there and they will help me win this war in one fell swoop.  To forge this pact, I need the sacrifices of three pure hearts, the hearts of the three that you have captured for me are the purest of all.  Their blood will form the bonds i need to win the ultimate victory.  So now this is what I need you to do for me, when i open this rift i will be making the promise to these demons of the sacrifices, i need you to carry out the killing of them.&quot;<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;I will do as you command my Lord.  Will that be all?&quot;<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Now i sence that you and Lanys wish some time alone, go, spend your time well.&quot;  Both Hamuro and Lanys got up and left Bertoxxulous's chambers arm in arm.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp * * * * * <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Kharne,&quot;  Esperanza whispered to her companion in the cell.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;What do you want?&quot;  Kharne replied harshly.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;I want to escape from here, i am sure that is what you want as well.  Alone we can not succeed, but together it will be easy.  Are you with me?&quot;<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Very well, but just untill we get out of here, then we go our separate ways, got it?&quot;  Kharne replied.  Esperanza nodded.  &quot;Well, why don't i get the door then.  You can make us not seen?&quot;<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;I can.&quot;&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Kharne began to search his clothes for something and then with a smile pulled out a small leather container, &quot;My spair lock-picks, never leave home without them, never know when you might be in a jam like this.&quot;  He walked up to the door and began his work, after a moment there was a click and the door swung open.  Arois looked up from his seat at the sound of the door and started to get up but then his head slammed against something hard and he sank to the floor unconcious.  Esperanza and kharne quickly grabbed there items that had been locked away in a chest near the cell, then as they were ready to head out they both heard the sound of two female voices coming down the stairs heading to the prison chamber.  They both quickly hid themselves and waited for the two to enter the room, it was Rocx and Solarii.  When they saw Arois on the floor unconcious they rushed to his sideand knelt beside him getting ready to say prayers of healing to their gods.  They never had the chance to finish them.  <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Esperanza charged out with two swords that she found lying on the floor at Solarii.  Solarii stood up to face Esperanza and attempted to defend herself, but she stood no chance against Esperanza and Esperanza buried both swords into her chest each puncturing a lung.  Solarii cried out in pain and fell to the ground.  Rocx turned and moved to help Solarii but was stopped short as the shaft of a spear protruded through her just above her stomach and just below her heart.  Kharne pulled the spear shaft out from Rocx's body and she slumped to the floor looking at kharne with eyes that were more hurt from his betrayal than from the wound he had given her.  Kharne and Esperanza then disappeared as Esper began to play one of her songs.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rocx then crawled over to Solarii who while still breathing was very close to death.  As Rocx reached Solarii, Arois stirred from his state of unconsciousness, when he saw what was before him he quickly moved to help rocx and Solarii.  &quot;Remove the swords from her body.&quot;  Rocx spoke, spitting blood.  &quot;I must heal her quickly or she will die.&quot;  Arois removed the swords from Solarii's chest, and then he understood what Rocx had said.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;You can't!&quot;  He exclaimed, &quot; if you heal her now in your state it will kill you.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Every Cleric knows that the power of Resurrection uses the energy of the gods to transfer a part of their own life force into the one who is being Resurrected.  One of us will die here today, both of us if i do nothing.  I have accepted my fate.&quot;  Rocx crawled close to Solarii, her own life blood pouring out of her, and she craddled Solarii in her arms and then began her prayer to Brell Serilis.  Arois pulled both of them into his arms and cried as he said good-bye to Rocx.  Rocx finished her prayer and kissed Solarii on the cheek, the last of her life force went through her kiss into Solarii's still form.  As Rocx's breathing became shallower Solarii's grew stronger.  Solarii soon began to breath the regular breath of sleep and then slowly opened her eyes.  Rocx had entered an even greater sleep, the sleep of eternity, and as Solarii realized what had happened she grasped hold of both Arois and Rocx and wept, wept for the sacrifice Rocx had made for her that she may live.  Solarii and Arois wept together.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp * * * * *<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lanys left Hamuro's bed later that evening, leaving Hamuro to rest.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Hamuro.&quot;  A voice spoke.  Hamuro sat up and looked around his bed chamber, seeing no one he laid back down to sleep.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Hamuro.&quot;  Came the voice again.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Who is there?&quot;  Hamuro said sitting up again.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Hamuro, remember your oath.&quot;  Hamuro did not know how but somehow that voice seemd familiar, and he knew that the voice did not come from his room, but from the depths of his heart.<br>

&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Chapter 9: Remembrance, The Dark Path.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp As Hamuro laid in his bed, the voice again come to him, &quot;Remember your path,&quot; The voice was that of a man, a deep and gravelly voice.  Hamuro closed his eyes and the dream began.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hamuro was at home, with his daughter Shasa, who less than a year ago had been rescued from the clutches of the Dark Elves who were using her in a plot to give new life to their god Innoruuk, The process had changed her from a High Elf to a Dark Elf, a state in which she has lived ever since.  She now serves as the new High Priestess of Tunare, with Lukaria's ascencion.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp A soft knock came to the door of the house and hamuro went to answer the door.  When he opened the door a sence of awe enveloped him, as a Dwarf dressed in bright shining armor entered the house.  Hamuro closed the door behind him and then knelt before the Dwarf that all Dwarves knew, Brell Serilis.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Please, Hamuro, rise, i come here on urgant business.&quot;  Hamuro rose and offered Brell Serilis a place to sit, and then sat and waited for the god to speak. &quot;I have come here to ask something of you, something that is going to be very difficult for you.&quot;<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Ask it my lord and it will be done.&quot;  Hamuro replied, &quot; My life is...&quot; Brell stopped him with a motion of his hand.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Before you answer this i want you to know everything that is at stake, everything that what i ask will involve.  This is the hardest thing i have ever had to ask.&quot;  Brell paused and looked down as if he was summoning the courage to speak his next words.  &quot;I want to ask you to forsake your vows to me, become evil, so that you can infiltrate and get close to Bertoxxulous and his partner Lanys T'Vyl.&quot;<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hamuro could do nothing but stare at his lord.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;I need you to stop them from completing their plans, for if they succeed all good on Norrath, and many other worlds will cease to exist, and evil will reign over the entire universe.  I cannot allow this to happen.&quot;<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hamuro looked up to his Lord and spoke, &quot;If this is what you wish me to do, then i will do so.&quot;<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Brell shook his head, &quot;You still do not understand all the consequences of what i am asking.  First to be able to even get close enough to Bertoxxulous you must abandon everything good about yourself, your love for your friends, for Shasa, the love you have for your Guild.  And even that wont be enough, you must have a heart of evil within you.&quot;  Hamuro looked down as what Brell Serilis had just told him began to sink in.  &quot;Take my hand, i wish to show you something.&quot;  Hamuro reached out and took Brell's hand, and in his mind Hamuro saw world after world and then Brell's voice came to him, on all these worlds goodness struggles against evil in a perfect balance.&quot;  More worlds began to be pictured to Hamuro, &quot;These worlds have just recently fallen to the might of the evil of the combined forces of Bertoxxulous and Lanys T'Vyl, Good still exists on these worlds in small pockets of resistance, but they still exist.&quot;<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Another world pictured itself in Hamuro's mind, &quot;This world is a world that has a wonderful treasure upon it, whoever controls this world be it good, be it evil, whoever is in control has the power to completely destroy all sources of it's opposing force, should Evil gain control of this world all traces of goodness throughout the universe will be completely wiped out.  If good controls it then all evil can be destroyed.  It has been in my charge and many other gods of good that this world cannot be allowed to be controlled by either side.  There must always be a balance between good and evil.  Norrath is the key to this world, whoever controls Norrath will gain access to the Treasure Planet.  Bertoxxulous has conquered many worlds in search of the key to this world, and now he has found it, and he plans to uleash a war upon this world.  But to ensure that he will gain victory he plans to open a rift into a Demon Plane and summon the power of the demons to sweep across Norrath, and through the Heavens where the gods themselves do battle.  With these forces at his command there will be no way to stop him.  This is what is at stake, if you do accept this you will be sacrificing everything you hold dear to you.  You may even have to fight against many of your friends from your guild.&quot;  The images in Hamuro's mind vanished and he was again in his house. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hamuro lifted his head, tears in his eyes, &quot;I understand all that you are asking me, I will accept this mission.  Everyone has a destiny, perhaps this is mine.  Let me talk to my daughter for a moment.&quot;  Brell nodded.  Hamuro went into the other room to talk to Shasa.  Moments later she came running out, stopped to look at Brell Serilis, tears streaming down her face, then ran out of the house.  &quot;I am ready.  But tell me, how do i become evil, i cannot on my own betray what is in my very nature.&quot;<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;There is an Artifact on another world known as the Heart of Darkness, once inserted into your own heart it will begin to take over, transforming your heart into pure Evil.&quot;<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp One month later Hamuro returned from his quest to find this Heart of Darkness.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;From everything you have told me about this Heart, how will i be able to fight it so that when the time comes i can return to my goodness and be able to stop Bertoxxulous and Lanys T'Vyl.&quot;  Hamuro asked Brell Serilis as the prepared to insert the evil Artifact into him.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;I will be with you always, Hamuro, when the time comes you will know, but you must fight with everything you have to come back to who you are now.  Knowing this, and knowing that you will most likey have to betray your friends in the guild, are you still willing to go through with this, there is still time for you to reconsider.&quot;<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;As i said a month ago, everyone has a destiny, i know now that this is mine.  I am ready.&quot;  Brell Serilis nodded and began to insert the Artifact into Hamuro, along with a small of himself.  He knew that bringing Hamuro back from this evil, Hamuro would need a fragment of goodness to hold onto, he just hoped that it was enough.  <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Suddenly a black tendril shot out from Hamuro and struck Brell Serilis, he screamed and fell to the floor.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp * * * * *<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hamuro shot up from his bed as he woke from the dream, he shook himself fiercely, and found that he had to wipe away a tear from his eyes.  He stood and got dressed into his Armor and then grapped his weapon, he headed to where the three Champions where being prepared for the sacrifice he was about to make to summon the Demons.  Hamuro reached the room where he was to kill them and found them arranged in a triangle laying upon stone slabs, chains binding their arms and legs to the stone.  Lillia was unconscious, Gorndax and Esperanza both watched as Hamuro entered the room and went to stand next to Gorndax and prepared his blade for the final strike to complete the ritual.  <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp A guard came up to Hamuro and stated, &quot;They are ready.&quot;<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hamuro raised his sword above Gorndax.  &quot;Hamuro,&quot; Came a woman's voice to his mind, and then a face appeared in front of him in his mind, it was Lukaria.  &quot;Hamuro, come back to us, remember your love for all of us, your love for me.&quot;  Hamuro closed his eyes as if to shut the picture out of his mind, then the image of his daughter shasa appeared and she spoke to him, &quot;Remember your love for me, come back to me father.&quot;  More faces went through Hamuro's mind, Rocx, Lillia, Ariell, Esperanza, Clarina, Kharne, Hakko, all of his friends, then one face looked back at him, Shasa's, then another, Lukaria, &quot;I love you Hamuro, come back to me.&quot;  Lukaria spoke, her voice carrying deep into Hamuro.  <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hamuro screamed as he brought his blade down onto Gorndax, there was a loud sound of metal hitting stone, and then his blade stopped.<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Eoman stood in the war room in front of Narvil, who had been elevated to the command of the Armies of Norrath, Eoman continued speaking his report.  &quot;All of our armies are in place in Qeynos, Freeport, and on Feydwar.  Enemy armies have also begun moving.&quot;  Narvil sighed hearing this news.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;So it begins.&quot;<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Ariell is also waiting outside for you, i believe you wanted to speak with her?&quot;<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Yes I did, You had better get back to your post, and send Ariell in when you go.&quot;<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Yes Narvil, may everything go well with you, and i will see you at the end of all this.&quot;  Eoman replied and then left the room.  After Eoman left Narvil got up from his desk and went over to the table that displayed a map of Norrath.  At that time Ariell entered the room.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;You wanted to speak with me Narvil?&quot;  She asked.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Come, look at this.&quot;  Narvil said and pointed to the map.  Ariell walked over and looked at the section of the map that Narvil had indicated, it was the continent of Feydwar.  &quot;The Armies of Bertoxxulous are massing in ther area known as Crushbone, Orcs, Goblins,  Dark Elves, and all manner of Undead from all over the continent.&quot;<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;But we have our forces in place to stop them&quot;  Ariell replied.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Yes, but no one to command them.  With Gorndax and Esperanza gone and many others amoung our ranks have fallen due to Hamuro's treachery and betrayal.  That is why i have asked to speak to you.  I would like to put you in charge of the Armies of Feydwar.&quot;<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;ME? I have no ability or qualities to lead an army.&quot;<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;You do.  You care about a great many things, and people will follow you because of that.  I have faith in you, and i need you, please.&quot;<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;I will do my best.&quot;<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Thank you Ariell, or i should now say General Ariell.  Choose three people to take with you as your lieutenants.  Hold them off from taking the continent.  They will most likey go after Felwithe first, then to Kaladim, as it is the Elves that hold off the access to the Dwarven homeland.  Now, go quickly, the enemy is almost ready to move from the reports that i have recieved.&quot;<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;I am on my way now then, Be safe, my friend.&quot;  Ariell gave Narvil a hug and then left the room.  Ariell then went to get her three Lieutenants, Gallinar, Lenexa, and Krace.  As they prepared themselves to leave, Clarina came to Ariell's room.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Ariell, i would like to go with you, it's my homeland as well, i want to be there to defend it.  My family and friends are there as well.  I know it will be dangerous, but no more dangerous to me than to you.&quot;  <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp From behind Clarina came another voice.  &quot;We will keep her out of trouble as well.&quot;  Clarina turned around and saw Takar and Mindler walk up to her.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Ariell spoke, &quot;All right you three, we leave within the hour, be ready.&quot;<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp * * * * *<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Be healed Lukaria&quot; A woman's voice spoke above Lukaria's body.  Lukaria felt a warmth rush into her, she opened her eyes and saw a dwarven woman looking down at her with a smile.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Rocx, isn't it?&quot;  Lukaria spoke.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rocx smiled and nodded in reply, &quot;I saw what you did with Hamuro, now at least i understand what is going on a little more.&quot;  Lukaria, with Rocx's help got to her feet.  &quot;You have to be more carefull, you are still new to all your powers.  We don't need our General here dying cause she doesn't know the limits of her own powers.  We need you at the front, Brell Serilis is doing ok now, and the war is beginning out there.&quot;<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Everything now rests on Hamuro, and the ability for his friends with him now to forgive what he has done, he is the hope of Norrath and for all us gods.  He must defeat Bertoxxulous now.  But all we can do now is hope. Let's go Rocx, i will need you at my side for this battle to come.&quot;<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp * * * * *<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Ariell and her companions arrived in the early morning hours in Felwithe where she took over the leadership of the armies there.  She was also met with a wonderful surprise, an army of Dwarves had came to help with the defences of the forest, for they knew that if the Feydarks fell then nothing would stop the destruction of Kaladim.  That evening Gallinar burst into Ariell's study, &quot;I think you should come take a look.&quot;  Ariell followed Gallinar at a dead run, untill she reached the top of the wall and looked out over the forrest.  There where Kelethin stood, rose a large plume of smoke. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;It can't be,&quot; Ariell gasped.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;It is, Kelethin is burning.&quot;<br>
<br>

&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp CHAPTER 11: TO FIGHT EVIL<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Gorndax felt the rush of air from Hamuro's sword and he waited for the blow that would kill him, but the blow never came, instead he heard the clang of metal on metal and then metal on stone and suddenly Gorndax could again move his arm.  Shortly after that came the same sound and his other arm was freed and then his legs, he was completely free.  As he struggled to reorient himself he heard the same sounds coming from the other two stone alters where Lillia and Esperanza were chained down.  Finally his sight came back to him and he saw Hamuro standing near him, Gorndax moved quickly and before Hamuro knew it he had his hands aournd Hamuro's neck.  &quot;Kill me and kill any hope that Norrath has left.&quot;  Hamuro choked out at Gorndax.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Esperanza recovered and looked over weakly at the two struggling dwarfs, &quot;Gorndax, listen to him, at least give him the chance to explain his actions.&quot;<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp With her words Gorndax released Hamuro and said, &quot;You have untill we can get our armor and weapons back on to explain yourself, and i may still kill you.&quot;  Hamuro nodded and then moved over to Lillia and laid his hands on her.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;She is almost dead, Brell, give me the strength to heal her wounds, give her your strength as it will be greatly needed in the hour to come.&quot; As Hamuro spoke his hand began to glow a soft white glow and anergy and power and life force flowed into Lillia's broken form covering her in a soft white light.  When the light faded she was whole again, without a mark on her form from the lashings and beatings she had taken while held prisoner.  Hamuro then went over to Esperanza and again prayed to Brell for his healing touch and she too was healed leaving no marks of her imprisonment here, except one, the one thing that could not be healed, her missing eye.  &quot;Come,&quot; he finally said, &quot;I will take you to your things, and as we walk and you dress i will explain everything.&quot;<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hamuro led them to their clothing, weapons and armor, and while they dressed he explained from the beginning all that had taken place and why he had done what he had done.  <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Why could you not tell us, we are your friends?&quot;  Lillia asked when he had finished.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Because had he told us, the Bertoxxulious would have been able to find out much easier.&quot;  Gorndax responded.  &quot;But how do we know that you have truely overcome this evil artifact that you carry with you now?&quot;  Hamuro could only look at him in responce.  &quot;At the first sign of any betrayal then, you will die Hamuro.&quot;  Hamuro just nodded.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Wether you believe what i have just told you or not, i intend to face Lord Bertoxxulious, alone if i have to.  He cannot be allowed to proceed with what he plans.&quot;<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;You will not have to fight alone Hamuro, I will stand by your side.&quot;  Esperanza said, standing as she finished getting her armor on, Lillia stood next to her.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;I too, will fight with you Hamuro.&quot;  Lillia said clasping Hamuro's shoulder.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Madness,&quot; Gorndax spat, then moved to Hamuro and place his hand on his other shoulder, &quot;I guess i am in with you as well, let's go kill a god.&quot;  All four of them then walked out, Hamuro in the lead.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp * * * * *<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;The time is almost here.&quot;  Lanys said, &quot;By now the blood of the three companions should be staining the floor, the sacrifice to the demon gods has been made.&quot;  <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lanys T'Vyl and Lord Bertoxxulous stood in the center of a vast chamber.  Wide columns lined the walls of the chamber.  In the center of the chamber was an alter surrounded by a black circle, it is hear that Bertoxxulous and Lanys T'Vyl stood, performing the last rites of the ritual that would open the gateway to the realm of the demon-kind.  In front of them was the stairway the led Hamuro and his three companions into the dark chamber.  <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Upon seeing Hamuro Lanys moved up to him from the alter, &quot;Well done, my love.&quot;  It was then that she saw the three that accompanied him, &quot;TRAITOR!!&quot;<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Espeanza and Lillia came up to Hamuro's side, &quot;Let us take care of this one, you and Gorndax go after Bertoxxulous himself.&quot;  With that they moved in and engaged the evil woman as Hamuro and Gorndax moved on to Bertoxxulous.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;You are a great deciever, Hamuro, bearer of the Dark Heart, but you are still too late, the demons have already been summoned and will be here soon, you have failed.&quot;  As Hamuro and Gorndax stepped within the dark ring encircling the altar, an earthquake struck the chamber. The floor surronding the dark circle split apart and a great chasm opened separating the dark circle from the rest of the chamber floor by four feet and the sound of shieking demons could be heard from within.  Hamuro and Gorndax charged the evil god, but Bertoxxulous was ready, with a flash Hamuro was flung across the room and slammed into the wall, Hamuro sank to the floor unconcious.  Gorndax closed in on the god, Bertoxxulous drew his sword and engaged the General in single combat.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lillia and Esperanza fought a desparate battle against the daughter of darkness Lanys T'Vyl but found themselves losing ground.  Lanys forced them ever closer to the chasm, her swords whirling about her to block and parry her attackers attacks and then landing attacks of her own wherever a defence was exposed.  As the neared the edge of the chasm Lanys delivered a crushing blow to Esperanza's head and she collapsed in a heap leaving Lillia to fight her alone.  Lillia looked to her fallen friend and her eyes narrowed in determination and renewed strength.  Both women had tried to use their spells to aid them but found that in this room their magic did not function.  And so Lillia pressed on her opponent with furiosity, Lanys was caught off-guard by this new round of attacks and was forced to retreat her position.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Gorndax fought with furosity against the dark god but was no match for him, Bertoxxulous parried every blow Gorndax threw at him, and then returned by landing devastating blow after blow.  With a mighty swing Bertoxxulous sent Gorndax's sword flying through the air and with a vicious punch sent the dwarf sprawling to the floor, his wind knocked out of him.  Bertoxxulous stood over him his sword raised to deliver the death blow, &quot;This is the price of defying me!&quot;  His sword arched down on the dwarf struggling to regain his strength, and was met with the ring of steel on steel as another sword materialized out of nowhere above Gorndax.  &quot;YOU, TRAITOR, now i will kill you with my bare hands.  Hamuro stood there in front of the dark god and smiled.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;My destiny has already been chosen, and now i will send you to meet yours.&quot;  Hamuro spoke calmly.  Their swords clashed, Bertoxxulous fumed with rage and anger and sent rage filled blow after blow at Hamuro who calmly blocked them.  But Hamuro soon began to lose ground, never finding the opportunity to strike with his own attacks.  Another blow pushed Hamuro ten paces away from the dark lord and to the edge of the chasm.  Hamuro looked up at the dark Lord and smiled raising his sword above his head, Bertoxxulous charged,  his blade pierced through Hamuro's black armor into his lung and through his body.  Hamuro grabbed hold of Bertoxxulous's wrists as the momentum of the charge carried him over the edge and into the chasm, only then did Bertoxxulous realize his mistake.  Hamuro grabbed for the edge of the chasm and caught himself from falling,  Bertoxxulous clung to the hilt of his sword as the demons rushed up from the pit, the demons grabbed hold of Bertoxxulous and wrenched his grip from the hilt of the sword stuck fast into Hamuro's chest.  The Dark Lord screamed as he plummeted into the pit.  <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hamuro began to slip from the edge of the chasm, the pain from his wound overcoming him, but just as he began to fall a hand grasped his and then another, and they began to pull him up from the chasm.  As he reached the top of the chasm the scream of a woman pierced the air, Hamuro and Gorndax looked over and saw Lanys T'Vyl disengage from her battle with Lillia and run to the edge of the chasm where she leapt over sword ready to come down on the unprepared Dwarves.  Suddenly a blue armored arm reached up and grabbed hold of her leg and caused her to come to a stop over the center of the great chasm, she screamed as she began to plummet into the pit after her master Bertoxxulous.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lillia went over to Esperanza and helped her to stand, putting her arm around her to support her.  Gorndax finished pulling Hamuro out of the chasm and then began to remove the sword from his chest, Hamuro cried out in pain as the sword came out and Gorndax began to speak, &quot;Brell, bring down your life force onto your servant who sacrificed so much to see that evil would not rule this land or any other land, give him your blessing and restore his strength.&quot;  As he spoke his hands began to glow a soft white and that glow began to spread over Hamuro's body untill he was completely engulfed in the pure white light of the power of Brell Serilis.  When the glow faded the two dwarves stood and then leapt to the other side of the chasm.  &quot;Come on, it is time for us to get out of here.&quot;  Hamuro said, holding his chest where the Bertoxxulous's blade had entered &quot;I know the way.&quot;<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hamuro led them to the passage that he had used many times under the orders of the Dark God, but as the entered the teleportation room they were spotted by the guards who came after them. &quot;How many are there?&quot;  Lillia asked.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Twenty or more.&quot;  Gorndax replied, &quot;We'll never make it out of the fore...&quot;  It was then that he noticed that Hamuro had stayed back at the door into the room with the teleporter.<br>
&quot;Hamuro, no, it's suicide.&quot;<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;The porter is there, just press that button while standing on the platform, go, i will buy you time.&quot;  Hamuro said.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;We can't allow you to do this Hamuro,&quot; Lillia said stepping up to him.  &quot;you will never make it passed so many, not in your condition.&quot;<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;GO, you are needed by many more.  My destiny is complete, yours has just begun Lillia, go now, i will hold them back long enough for you to make your escape.&quot;<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Gorndax went up to Lillia and took her by the hand, &quot;come, let his sacrifice mean something.&quot;  With those words all three stepped onto the platform pressed the button and activated the platform, as the began to dissappear Hamuro turned and charged at the guards coming after them.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp * * * * *<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Eoman looked up from the western walls of the city of Freeport, and as he looked toward the Lavastorm mountains his heart froze and he began to shake in fear as a massive beast with wings colored in the red of blood and fire rose the dragon known as Nagafen.  Nagafen let out a great roar and began his flight toward the commonlands.<br>
<br>
<br>
