I check everything I have in my account and in the stuff I am carrying to see if I didnt have anything I could do something with. I found, hidden away in the bottom of one of my backpacks, a Greater Lighstone. So, having nothing better to do, I take out my spellbook and memorize the spell that will take me in the area known as North Ro (I am a Wizard). Upon my arrival in North Ro, I head out for the Oasis, after answering the questions of an ignorant young Human. After crossing the Oasis, I end up in South Ro, I get my bearings and head for the encampment some of my fellow Dark Elves hold there. One of them rewards me with a research book when I bring her one of those lightstones. Dont ask me what she does with them, though, as I have no idea. After giving her the stone, I turn around and, much to my amazment, see the Ancient Cyclops far away in the distance.<br>
<br>
As I get near him, I ask myself &quot;Can I take him?&quot;. I am a Wizard of considerable skill, having achieved the 35th circle, I wield elemental powers with some potentially disastrous results to my foes. But, the Ancient Cyclops is a force to be reckoned with, and I have my doubts still. After a short while of questionning myself (and amazement he has not yet been brought down by someone else), I come to the conclusion that the risk is worth the reward, and I begin to cast a spell. The Cyclops roared with rage when his feet got entangled in the roots I had magically called to my aid. His skin began to freeze under the power of my Ice spells. The fight lasted for a good while, he broke my roots 2 times and beat me up some, but I finally killed him. After the fight, I was shaking. The fight had been rough, and I was wounded. He had also taken almost all my magical energies to kill. So I headed towards his frozen body on my shaking legs. As I searched him for valuables, I found what I had hoped for: The ring of the Ancients!!! Word quickly spread out among my Order that I had killed this beast and found the ring the little midget in the Mountains was looking for.<br>
<br>
But that was not all, for Hasten also wanted a shadowed rapier (which only lasts a short time in the possession of someone else than the denizens of shadows) and 3250 pieces of gold! Now, do not ask me why he wants only gold pieces, it's a lot heavier than the equivalent in platinium, but who am I to question the weird fellow? So I set out with friends to gently ask some shadowed men for one of their rapiers. As you all could guess, the didnt want to give us one, so we had to use force. After a while, one of them was finally carrying this piece of equipment, so I had the pleasure of relieving him from it. I then went to the Mountains of Rathe with a friend (to help me carry the incredible ammount of money) to look for the little Gnome known as Hasten Bootstrutter. After a while of questionning people, it was obvious that Hasten wasnt around this time. And as it was getting late, I decided to make camp for the night.<br>
<br>
On the following day (ooc: Sunday), when I woke up, I quickly searched my bags. As you could guess, the rapier was gone. So I waited for my friends to get up (they sleep very late usually). After a good deal of waiting for one of the friend I would need most to help me in my quest (He's an Ogre Shaman, she he has the strenght to carry the considerable ammount of gold, and the spells to help us catch Hasten), we set out to one of the Shadowed Men encampements. We had to kill a few more to get one of their rapiers (they are slow learners, heh). So, with the rapier in hand, the gold in my friend's pockets and the ring on my wrist (Cyclops have big fingers <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ), we head for the Mountains of Rathe. Upon our arrival, we quickly learned that another group of people was looking for him, so we offered to let them know if we ever got a hang of him, and they did the same. (ooc: 2 minutes after zoning in, I met one of Hasten's placeholders simply named &quot;a drake&quot;. I quickly dispatched him and crossed my fingers) After a short while, we heard that the gnome had been spotted, in the area where Hill Giants liked to play... So, taking summoning all our courage (or foolishness), me and my friend head out to the area. When we got there, the other group was already there and they were keeping him busy with a game of chess (<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ). In my eagerness, I must've made a movement the little guy took as a threat, because he started pounding on me. As you all can guess, he made short work of me and I was soon headed to meet my Lord. On my way up, I heard an angelic voice (I do not need to tell you, as a Dark Elf, they are painful to hear), telling me that she would help me come back. So, this High Elf lady (Grrr) called her god (I do not even want to hear who it was, I feel soiled now) and he granted me another chance. If he only checked who he was helping... Anyway, the people there kept the midget busy with a game long enough for me to come back and do business with him.<br>
<br>
So, I now have a pair of Journeyman Boots. Be careful all, because I can now come up on you faster than ever before! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :evil --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/devil.gif ALT=":evil"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
(ooc: I want to thank all those who helped me with this. Nashkel, Reptilicus and Ellricc for the 1st night of Shadowed Men camping. Kilamar, and Floob for the second night and for the help in finding Hasten and carrying the stuff. The person who kept Hasten busy with Hails in the HG area until the 2 groups looking for him got there. Cinadina for rezzing me after my clumsy mistake. And her and her group too (I know Bodhi was there, and another one of whom I forgot the name) for staying until the rez effects were gone. I am happy I finally have those boots. I have been extremely lucky this week end for all of that. Thanks all!) <p><font color="#FF6600">

<br>
As I was travelling through Oasis, I saw this &lt;cough&gt; Wizard and saw the boots he had that made him move VERY fast. I decided that I wanted these boots for myself. I had run up to the wizard you was immediatly scared out of his mind...him being so weak, me so unbelievably powerful. He tried to cast his feeble spells, to no avail. He tried to run but felt the might of my axe as it cleaved him over and over. And as I was wiping the blood of my axe, I tried to take these boots, only to see they were glued to his feet. I softly cursed as I mummbled, &quot;At least another wizard dead...&quot;<br>
