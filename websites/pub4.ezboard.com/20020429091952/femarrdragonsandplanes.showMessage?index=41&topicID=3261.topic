<br>
I completely agree that something as objective and mystical as <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> life</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> can't be defined. Whether or not you want to play a video game all your life, sail the 7 seas, or climb Mt. Everest, is all equal and more then adequate. But, is life about adequacy?<br>
<br>
Your life can only be measured by what you achieve within it, and you can't achieve much playing a video game 14 hours a day.  Perhaps if any of you would actually die a happy man knowing you had a level 60, then that would hold validity. Life is precious, and while no one can tell you how to live it, there's a vast difference between surviving and living. <br>
<br>
I despise extreme analogies as much as the next guy, but if your child grows up and decides he has to collect empty tooth-paste packets, so he quits college and hunts for spare change down at the beach for hours on end while collecting a welfare check, all so he can collect his pile of toothpaste, you're going to have a problem with that.<br>
<br>
Extremities allow us to see that lines can be drawn. Not have to, but can. And while I can fully understand you not wanting to listen to someone come on your turf, and hypocritically bitch at you for playing EQ while they catch their 5th consecutive hour of television, you guys have to realize that playing 15+ hours a day, just so you can have the biggest virtual @#%$ on the server is not a life, and your losing your most precious commodity if you can't see that.<br>

Would it be reasonable to argue that spending quality time with friends constitutes &quot;having a life&quot;?  I would say so, based upon most of the examples of &quot;having a life&quot; that people give.  Certainly some people play Everquest in order to spend time with friends.  I happen to be of the opinion that online friends will only rarely be as true as RL friends, but some people have clearly proven that it's possible to form bonds in game that are as strong as those formed in RL.  Da`Kor are a good example.<br>
<br>
Even disregarding the fact that we can't seem to define exactly what constitutes &quot;having a life&quot;, there seems to be reason to believe that one can do so while playing a lot of Everquest.  The comparison given to collecting toothpaste packets is silly not only becuase of it's extremity, but because it is completely dissimilar to playing Everquest.  It's just not social.  Not to mention the fact that it's not something any reasonable or rational person would consider fun or interesting, and Everquest is. <p>Arikel, n00b thane of The Grey Legion <BR>

You collect them (loot), it takes a long time (downtime) and you have to be wary of KOS red cons (bag ladies looking for change)<br>
<br>
Regardless, I never made the argument that Everquest is wrong or 'not having a life' within a casual standpoint. For those people who play EQ socially or within a reasonable amount of time (whatever that amount of time may be) is more than fine.<br>
<br>
But I see people who've been playing way less than I have, and have 3-6 unpleveled 40+ characters, several of them 55+. I realise this isn't the norm, but it's rather common in our little society, and you just can't achieve that playing a few hours a night. I also see hordes upon hordes of level 60+ characters, hordes of NToV gear, etc.<br>
<br>
With all the NToV capable guilds in Everquest, I'd say casual gamers, (<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> true</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> casual gamers that is) are the exception, not the rule. I mean it's pretty blatantly obvious when an entire populace has a different set of rules for 'casual' gamers than any other populace on the planet. How many hours was UI in the Planes back in their pharmfest 2000? Was it 50+ straight? Something like that.<br>

<br>
Take the couch potato, or people who surf sports radio broadcasts for hours a day... do they have a life?<br>
<br>
Hmm... what of the book worm? The movie afficiando? The body builder? <br>
<br>
Basically, what is considered "casual" will depend upon what a person views as a <i>hobby</i>. Anyone who has a hobby will spend hours a day at it. Some of us game, others have sex. Errr... well, I think I am changing hobbies now.<br>

<br>
I think i could put up a pretty valid argument that everquest is not in fact social. The fact the you are sitting home alone, for 12hrs a day, with a pizza next to the computer, isn't what I picture as a &quot;social&quot; endeavor. Being &quot;social&quot; is a lot more, imho, then just &quot;chatting with someone online&quot;. Is chatting on the phone 12hrs/day social? nah.<br>
<br>
Other then that, do i think you can have a &quot;life&quot; when you play EQ 12hrs/day? (the requirnments for many uber guilds). For me, the answer is no. Obviously, this is influenced by my perception of what &quot;having a life means&quot;.<br>
<br>
But, when i was in Midnight Sojourn (and before i left EQ), i realized i was sacrificing my REAL LIFE for a game.<br>
<br>
Sitting, clicking &quot;connect to Erollisi Marr&quot; while the servers were down, sometimes just doing that over and over for an hr or more (and i wasn't alone), I realized i had some sort of problem =)<br>
<br>
When i skipped friend/family occassions (and for anyone who is an uber guild and says they don't skip special occassions is a lying like a son of a b****), i realized something wasn't right.<br>
<br>
When my parents and friends would ask me, so what did you do this week, and i had to lie (i do'nt think my parents would of thought hihgly of me saying &quot;I killed Vox tonight after 22hrs of straight playing, oh yeh, and i forgot to eat&quot;) i realized something was wrong.<br>
<br>
When i did a 12 hr raid on Christmas Day, and New Years Eve with the guild, i thought, maybe i should be doing something else on the most festive of holidays.<br>
<br>
Anywho, i'm not gonna blab on and on, but when i played EQ for 12hrs/day, i DID NOT have a life (and frankly, i cant see how anyone who plays that long can have a &quot;life&quot; by my definition). I sacrficied real life occasions, lied to friends/family, missed classes, etc... and the fact is, most people who dedicate 12hrs/day playing EQ, do some or all of those things (and i know a lot of people who are guilty of those traits).<br>
<br>
Nonetheless, some of these people are still my good &quot;online&quot; friends, and i definately am thankful i met them. However, since i've left EQ, my grades have shot up (woohoo graduating finally), i've travelled europe, and going to australia for 3 months this summer, i've dated (unheard of when i played - hon, do you want to watch me raid veeshans peak), and generally, i'm having a better time then i played eq. <br>
<br>
And, from hearing people who have &quot;left&quot; EQ speak of there life before, and after leaving eq, i think most people find there life after EQ much more enjoyable.<br>

I actually believe I have a life, and a very fufilling one at that (for a 17 year old).  I fulfill all &quot;social requirements&quot; to having a life, that is, volunteering somewhere (juvi. justice), holding down a job, playing/coaching a sport year round (mostly every week day), and getting good grades in school (preparing for college).<br>
<br>
On the other hand, when i'm not with my friends on the *weekends*, I am pulling 8-12 hour EQ days, but at the same time, I do have a life.  And I do agree with Ablazen whereas someone pulling 12 hours a day 7 days a week probably does not meet &quot;social requirements&quot; for a life, does that necessarily mean they do not believe they have a life?  maybe they dont care?  some believe that life is more or less a pointless journey (/cheer juvi. justice system lessons), going from enslaved high school to college / career where, they believe, its more or less impossible to have fun.  I'd assume they think its better to have fun with their life in their way than to just do what peopel expect.<br>
<br>
As for the sacrificing RL issues to play the game, even I do that once and a while.  Classic example is the day after midterms in school, which is basically a &quot;day off&quot;.  As apposed to going to school for the donut party in Calculus class and the newspaper crossword in Journalism, i'd just stay home.  I'd never quit my job / soccer over EQ, but a day off from the stresses of life every now and again (one a month?) is half expected IMO.<br>
<br>
Also, i'd like to commend everyone who posted (Yall and Lur. especially) on keeping this a discussion as apposed to a rant.<br>
<br>
Parum<br>
<br>
p.s. I frequently take weeks off from EQ at a time (as in this week) to fullfill my &quot;social requirements&quot; to having a life.<br>
<br>
