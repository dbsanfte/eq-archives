I really think this is all a product of misinformation.  I was at the SRo portal after the servers came up when Drall and Khelder agreed on how they were gonna set up the camps.  There was no &quot;invocation&quot; of the lame Play Nice Policy by either guild.  It appeared to me to be a simple agreement between two guild leaders, which was executed according to plan.  In the wee hours, when everyone got a bit tired I think we did take some jabs at each other in /ooc for a little while.  But I also remember for certain that when Inno dropped the folks from Affliction were being very cool about it sending us congratulations.  That was really nice of you guys by the way.  Also, when we ported out everyone wished everyone else good luck and everything continued to be positive.  Then we somehow come to this.<br>
<br>
I am uncertain of two things.  First, I don't know where the info came from that SF invoked the lame PnP which we have publicly denounced.  That is just factually inaccurate.  Second, I don't understand why an MS officer has chosen to referee a &quot;dispute&quot;(does a dispute even exist) between Affliction and SF.  Maybe this was just a forum for some personal issues to be vented.  Maybe it was just a big misunderstanding.  I'm not sure.<br>
<br>
I agree with Nic.  There is no need to flame MS.  I'm told it's a good guild and I'm told Trill is an excellent leader.  I also like Jubei.  We were Chevaliers together way back when.  However, when an officer of another guild refers to us as all being &quot;trash&quot;, it's a little difficult not to take offense.  I think these comments were made out of character.<br>

<br>
Who are you to judge anyone?<br>
<br>
Hence we killed Innoruk solo as a single guild with 32 people and instead of posting something positive or not saying anything at all, you have to find something to rant about, childish, extremely childish and I am not quite sure what your true motives are but I have a solid idea.<br>

<br>
Thought i'd add a little imput to this thread, as I've always spoke my mind. Two specific points come to mind:<br>
<br>
1) Congrats on the slaying of Innoruk. After failed attempts, it's nice to show that persitance payed off. In fact, I had been conversing with several SF and wishing them luck for the raid. Congrats<br>
<br>
2) On that note, although you did slay Innoruk, i must comment on 1 fact (take it as you wish). SF has been in hate 3-4 days out of the last week, and although you were 'on a mission', perhaps it should have been taken into consideration that other people would like a 'shot' at Inny, or more likely, be allowed a 'shot at the zone' solo. SF had several chances in Hate before (and at Inny), and they failed (nothing implied). Perhaps it was time to let affliction have the plane to themselves, or some other guilds. Personally, i dislike sharing planes, mostly because of the lag, crossing 'ooc' messages, and perhaps even pulling errors which can happen as a result. These probelms will hopefully be solved with the expansion.<br>
<br>
Comment Bevo: Well Said<br>
<br>
Comment: Yadan (*smiles*)<br>
<br>
As a note to Yadan particularly, I've always felt that doing a 'dragon' or doing a 'plane' is significantly different. There are several guilds that are 'planes' capable (which requires 18 people to break/hold/farm). However, to do a dragon, you need twice as much as this (usually <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ), not to mention specific gear, and specific classes often to succeed. This is where the prime difference is between a dragon/plane is. In fact, I believe Nagafen was up for about 2 days after a patch (the day we killed vox) however no one took him down.<br>
<br>
Anyways, i'm done, congrats all who got some Phat L00t, but more importnatly, congrats on taking Inny.<br>

<br>
Rhamel flamed my whole guild last night.  He accused us of farming, and training.  Ok, as for farming: Affliction goes to a plane once a week.  Hate was our one plane for the week, and that was it.  However, Storm's Fury has been 3 or 4 times.  Does anyone else see any logic behind Rhamel's statement? (I am not flaming SF for spending that much time in Hate, I am pointing out that I hate hypocrites).  As for training, we had been neutral for 30 mins, discussing things in the guild and not pulling anything, yet Rhamel accuses us again of training your pulling path.  I'd like to quote Haknukum and say &quot;Roses are red, violets are blue, Rhamel can't pull and blames it on you.&quot; *Cheers Hak*<br>
<br>
Lastly, one comment you made to us really disturbed me last night Drall.  You told us to go back to farming our own corner.  What were you implying by this?  Are you accusing my guild of farming Hate?  If so, you are terribly mistaken, my friend.  We did come for loot, yes, but going to a plane once a week for one spawn is hardly farming imo.<br>
<br>
btw, I would like to tip my hat to Yadan for being a very mature individual throughout the night, and congrats to SF on your slaying of Inno. <p>Eurmuthur Edgecrusher

<br>
Blessed for you to say you have never begged for gear... ROFLMAO Yes, you don't beg, but instead manipulate men into giving you them.  So I give you credit on your skills in manipulation, but no credit in your skills as a player.  My biggest regret was talking you into staying on the EM server when you thought about starting over, but in retrospect, I realize now that is just another one of your stupid ploys for attention that you seem to need from any and all that will give you it.<br>
<br>
And Drall... i think the second time, or was it third, when you disbaned SF and were guildless for a while, I distinctly remember you saying that you wanted to join our guild or Da`Ice.  To bad no one wanted your greedy ass =)  And as for my motivites, I used to think you were a cool guy, but then I started reading the Emarr board and saw how you chose to insult people and then I learned who you really are.   <p>Jubei Kibagami <BR>

For some reason he seems to have problums with SF,Drall, and Blessed. To my knowlage no one in SF has done anything to Jubie in the past, but if they have its up to you as a reasonable person to confront them with these things. not to flame a guild as you have here.<br>
<br>
 As to farming and the rest, well I belive that farming is happening and there is no way to stop it. Ppl will go into zones and set up camp for items they need and stay till they get them. Thats unfortunitly part of this game. To accuse ppl of it dosent stop it to whine about it only helps you vent and piss others off.You cant tell me that you Jubie have never farmed stuff just as I cant tell you that I havent. Because by deffintion alone we are all guilty of it. I belive if you read the rest of the posts here you will see that PnP was not used and I know none of the ppl in SF would ever use it to try to ruin another guilds raid.<br>
<br>
 Now on to the Rhamel issue. Rhamel is an excellent puller. He has proven it time and again in the planes. Ablazen is correct in the fact that with mutiple groups in the planes it becomes incressingly harder to pull clean, but to my knowlage none of our pulls ended with Affliction being trained or any of there monks taking the hit. Tempers did flare towards the end with a 5 MOB train going up the ramp to Inno, we do not know were it came from but I belive it was a crossed pull that caught the back end of our ppl going up the ramp. Rhamel did lose his temper and /ooc somthing unfourtinetly I was in the Arena when that happened and I  belive appologies were given afterword. As for lag well what can I say ppl LD all night it happens we lived with it and so did affliction.<br>
<br>
 As to all of us in SF being scum, dirtbags or whatever you want to call us, I wont justify this with a response. Drall is an outstanding leader and has all of our support and confidence.<br>
<br>
 If you do feel you need to complain about our guild or one of its members. Please direct it to that individule, or to Lith who is our guild officer in charge of complaints.<br>

<br>
     I keep trying to post on this and I get something else handed to me to do at work. <br>
<br>
     Anyway, Jubei I would like to say up until your post on this thread I had the utmost respect for you. I will give you credit for saying that your post does not represent MS (being friends to a few of MS members, I respect your guild for those few people I know are great people and I know they would keep only the best of company). One thing you forgot to omit was at the end of your post, stating you were a proud officer of MS. What conclusion are people supposed to come to?<br>
<br>
     I will qualify now. I was not in on the insertion to the POH nor for 90% of the raid to kill Inno but it is my undrstanding that some sort of arrangment was made with Affliction for the raid. As Ablazen and Rhamal have pointed out there are inherent problems with 2 guilds in a raid on a plane (pulling problems and LD problems). This was endured by all involed in the POH. Yes, maybe there is a better way to handle this in the future, any feedback from anyone would be greatly appreciated. <br>
<br>
     As to our being in POH several times this week. Yes, we were, but as someone stated earilier, they were not loot runs, they were what you might call training runs for the big fight. Learing the zone, getting our tactics down pat, etc. Was this unfair? Probably, and for that I apologize. However not many guilds do planes runs during the week (I could be wrong correct me if this is so). If these runs had been loot runs, I and a lot of other SF would be wearing a lot more planes gear than we are now. Yes, we got loot but it was not our primary function this week.<br>
<br>
     Drall greedy? I can go along with that. If wanting the best for those in your guild and wanting to be with them when they reach new heights beyond the norm is greedy, then Drall is one greedy bastard and I love him for it. <br>
<br>
     Farming? I think Zalig pretty much summed that up. <br>
     <br>
     I would like to give major props to the members of SF for the kill of Inno (I went LD after casting one heal and wasn't able to get back in time for the kill, you bastards killeed him too fast<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  and maybe it was just poetic justice being I wasn't there for most of the raid<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ). <br>
<br>
     I would like to leave this in saying that ANY problems with SF members should be taken to me. If you could do this, your cooperation would be greatly appreciated.<br>

This is more a paraphrasing of something above, i care not to look for at the moment.<br>
<br>
But now Lith is stating that one should contact him no matter who the problem is with i.e// &quot;ANY problems with SF members &quot;. <br>
<br>
I'm just inquiring why you have 'one official problem dude', and why cna't problems be resolved on a face to face basis, without a 'moderator' of sorts.<br>
<br>
Anyways, congrats on your achievement, and congrats to Drall for oraganizing the event.<br>
<br>
&gt;However not many guilds do planes runs during the week<br>
<br>
This was not true before, but is not true now) I think the planes are taking every day of the week now.<br>

     First of all thank you for the correction on the planes runs on weekdays. As I stated, I could be wrong.<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
     As to the issue of a mediator. You bring up a good point. One should first try and work it out with the person in question it is always the best way to handle things. Should the problem not be solvable with said member and you feel you need to speak with an officer I would be the one to speak with.  Perahps I misrepresented myself and thank you for catching that. As to why I am the person to speak to otherwise, it is so Drall can concentrate on other issues concerning the guild. Nothing more, nothing less.<br>
<br>
<br>

Lith Ahntalon<br>
<br>
P.S. Problems concerning the guild as a whole can be brought to any officers attention.<br>

Also ablazen I meant in response to you saying deal with thing's face to face, well look at jubei and his public rant/flame without even talking to me heh.<br>
<br>
Bottomline I could give a fuk less what he think's, sf beat and destroyed inno, and correct me if I'm wrong but less daice noone on emarr has even fought him yet beside's sf. <br>
<br>
GM praos and zintlit's were there to cheer us on and grat's us for being the second guild to not only fight inno but beat him to on em and cheer us for doing it as one guild as well.<br>

It is making the split a little icky in places. But if you have any spent any time pulling, you'd know what is seen in north and south.<br>
<br>
North contains:-<br>
Fetid house<br>
Fetids (i forgot the first part <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  )<br>
Scarelings<br>
Shiverbacks<br>
Spinechillers<br>
Amy warriors<br>
Amy knights<br>
Glare lords<br>
Nightmares<br>
Phoboplasams (sp) and as to note on the Vermiculated armor, on the afore mentioned raid which Affliction and i clashed on, a Phoboplasm dropped Rune Etched boots and Vermiculated vambraces ON THE SAME MOB.<br>
And in addition the temple, which contains random mobs.<br>
<br>
South contains:-<br>
Frightfinger house<br>
Boogey house<br>
Gorgon area<br>
Scareling tower<br>
6 Amy Knights<br>
Fright<br>
Dread<br>
Terror<br>
Additional roamers of:-<br>
Spinechillers<br>
Scarelings<br>
Shiverbacks<br>
Amy warriors<br>
Amy knights<br>
Boogeymen<br>
Gorgons<br>
Glare lords<br>
Worry Wraiths<br>
Thought Bleeders<br>
Fetids<br>
Samhedian (sp)<br>
<br>
Its a little uneven, but its mostly a fair split. And if your groups are on good terms, they might let both groups in on the random -shrugs- It would matter on the individual group.<br>
<br>
Ahhh well.<br>
Have fun all.<br>
