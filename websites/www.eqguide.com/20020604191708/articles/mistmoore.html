      </a><b>Mistmoore Castle</b></h4>
    <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
      <p>What better place than here to go and slay dark elves to your hearts
      content? Maybe Neriak, but Mistmoore Castle offers better loot and not
      quite the risk involved in the dark elf homeland. Hunting is available for
      those of between the levels of 18-50. I would venture to guess this is one
      of the three zones I has spent the most time in; Split Paw (both before
      and after the take over) and Kithicor Forest being the others.<a href="../articlesold/images/mistmoorelg.jpg"><img border="0" src="../articlesold/images/mistmoore.jpg" align="right" width="206" height="155"></a></p>
      <p>There are as many as 12 hunting spots that can be identified within
      Mistmoore. It is an outside area so all druid spells are at their peak
      here - especially the wind series and Harmony, which you will use if you
      have half a brain. I also personally believe there is an experience bonus
      here and most of my friends will agree. Not sure if it's a bonus due to
      the zone, due to the fact that you are typically slaying casters, or a
      perceived bonus because most nights we had a never ending flow of kills.
      Another nice feature of Mistmoore, for clerics and necros at least, is
      many of Mayong's minions spawn as undead during the night. So pull out
      those undead spells for those freaks. The downside of this is if you are
      trying to invis or camo through certain areas you may get by all but one,
      then you are in deep trouble as everyone will see you after the undead one
      blows your cover.</p>
      <p>The problems with Mistmoore that I typically see are twofold. The zone
      huggers or runners, cowards, as I like to call them, make life rough for
      many people. The second issue is the upper level soloing crowd that is
      there to farm items from the zone and will train rare spawns out to the
      zone or get in over their head often and train the zone rather than die
      themselves. People like Neaoi on Fennin built great reputations for
      themselves for this sort of behavior, constantly training or kill stealing
      for his own personal gain. I have never understood what sort of idiot does
      this when it is much easier to gate out while in trouble rather than let
      your foolish mistakes kill others.</p>
      <p>For the Mistmoore beginners there is the lake area. Right inside the
      zone and down the hill you have an abundance of bad guys available, dark
      elves and a few gargoyles. These are the same gargoyles you find in the
      Ocean of Tears. The trick to this area is to use Harmony and grab one of
      the corners to the left of the entrance and pull there. You do need to
      learn the pathing here, as with many places in Norrath it's as buggy as it
      was before release and this causes deaths almost as often as trains from
      the cowards. Right past the lake area is a tunnel that runs back to the
      graveyard area and depending on how many people are around you may be able
      to pull from there also. Make sure you have someone on snare duty at ALL
      times, this goes for anywhere in Mistmoore.</p>
      <p>Past the tunnel area is the graveyard and secret room area. The
      graveyard has plenty of spawns to keep one good group busy all night,
      possible two depending on size, age, and makeup of groups. Within the
      graveyard is a shadowman. He is one of the good guys as far as shadows go.
      Killing him hurts Temple of Ro faction, as he is part of a necromancer
      quest there. You may also raise Temple of Ro faction by giving him the
      flower that spawns in the first crypt of the graveyard's mausoleum. Facing
      the mausoleum, the back left wall of the graveyard is a false wall. This
      is the passage to the secret room area. It consists of 3 rooms, all
      closed. To open the 3 rooms you must use the door that is straight ahead
      when you enter this area. It will open all 3 rooms at once and it may get
      ugly. The cleric ingot drops in here, or appears, for one of their quest
      armor pieces. Also in this room is the passage to the tower area you saw
      when you first entered Mistmoore and strolled down to the lake.</p>
      <p>The first set of stairs is fairly empty, most days. The avenging
      caitliff walks this path and has some nice shoulders for the melee types
      as well as being the quest person for the maid and butler fangs to receive
      Electrum Bladed Wakizashi. Further up the stairs you will run into a few
      more of those vile smurfy type elves as well as some gargoyles. When you
      reach the top of the stairs you may continue right or left. Lots of rooms
      with different bad guys and this is also one of the paths to Lasna Cheeron,
      who sometimes has the diamondine earring.<a href="../articlesold/images/entynilg.jpg"><img border="0" src="../articlesold/images/entyni.jpg" align="right" width="206" height="155"></a></p>
      <p>Back down to the graveyard area and you can exit through the gate and
      go straight ahead into a passage that requires an immediate right hand
      turn and then a descent. This is the courtyard area and typically has 3-6
      guards, sometimes with pets. This is a good spot for a group to hold, and
      have a little fun. To the left is a winding small trail that leads up to
      the castle. However, directly behind them you will see a passage up that
      leads to a few more elves and then some gargoyles that guard Enynti at the
      very back area. She is part of an enchanter quest for the mask from the
      Temple of Ro, however I have found that she doesn't drop the rune near
      like she used to in the good old days. ;-)</p>
      <p>Making your way up the trail to the castle doors you will be greeted
      with a full entourage of Mayong's women. Typically they are not happy
      about visitors. The best tactic I was ever shown here was to camo past all
      of them and cast Harmony from the back portion of this area and then pull
      the front one down the trail to your group that has cleared the courtyard.
      Personal experience tells me that you need to cast Harmony on the ones at
      the walkway into the castle for best results first, then the ones on the
      wall, then go pull. However - WORD OF WARNING - there is a roamer that
      walks along the walkway in and out of the castle. If he sees you and is
      alerted he runs into the castle first and brings LOTS out after you. It is
      typically a lower level pledge or initiate and if he spots you its best to
      gate, run, or die. Do not cast on this guy. Let him walk away. You have
      been warned. Keep this in mind if you are starting the Harmony cast and
      see him walk out of the castle gate, interrupt your self, back up and
      pray.</p>
      <p>Ok now inside. I do not suggest anyone pull from or fight in the first
      hallway. Take the right or left turns and go around to the main entrance
      area where you will see stairs to go up or an archway forward guarded by
      gargoyles. Against this wall, facing the archway, with your backs 100%
      against the wall is pretty safe for reinvis or camo if anyone needs it.
      This is also a halfway decent place to clear this front area. It can get a
      little rough at times, but an absolute blast. Also remember to snare. It's
      almost crucial to have an enchanter with you. I am pretty biased in the
      fact that I believe it's crucial to take Cailette with me anywhere so who
      knows how the rest of the world manages anyway, certainly not me. Too many
      casters around for a root type crowd control to be very effective.</p>
      <p>Past the archway you have an opened music room area full of the poor
      gypsies Mayong has enthralled. These are not your average gypsies as they
      are also werewolves at night. Very, very rarely they have the claws and
      pelts Karg in Everfrost is looking for to make the gloves and cloaks, but
      they do have the talon that the South Karana centaurs would like for the
      crafted breastplate. Miss Davissi also makes her appearance in this room
      from time to time. Bards are very familiar with her and what she carries
      for them, the Mistmoore drum. She is an enchanter and a pretty good one.
      She has actually charmed me, taken me through the entire castle and tower
      and made me break up 3 groups before charm ever broke. It was the longest
      charm ride I have ever been on and the most destructive. So beware of that
      issue if you do take her on. Back at the front of this area you had
      alcoves both right and left again. The left one is the conference room;
      the right one is the piano room. I will come back to the conference room
      later.<a href="../articlesold/images/musicroomlg.jpg"><img border="0" src="../articlesold/images/musicroom.jpg" align="left" width="206" height="155"></a></p>
      <p>The piano room has a few of those cute elves again as well as a door to
      the outside garden upstairs. This garden is filled with more of the same,
      but if you enter garden and turn right you can run over a bit and find the
      fountain. This is the home of the Damphrye, where the hooded black cloak
      comes from. Pretty much always camped and sometimes they are keeping the
      garden clean out of boredom.</p>
      <p>Back into the castle and through the gypsy music room area is a door.
      This door opens into a small hallway, which widens right up ahead. As the
      passage widens there are 4 gargoyle guards in each corner. This area also
      has a lower level roamer, like the front gate area. Leave them alone if
      they don't see you. He or she has a habit of screaming and running into
      the conference room and bringing all his higher level friends. Inside this
      area is a door to the left that opens up into the conference room area.
      This room has 3-6 visitors, some with pets, and is where the Gypsy
      Ambassador is typically found. If you have the gargoyles cleared it is
      possible to camo, open door, target someone near door, back up, open door
      and cast harmony from outside this room. With practice you will figure out
      where is the safest spot to do this, but be prepared for a few failures.
      They are called learning experiences or some call them deaths.
      &lt;snicker&gt;<a href="../articlesold/images/conferencelg.jpg"><img border="0" src="../articlesold/images/conference.jpg" align="right" width="206" height="155"></a></p>
      <p>Continuing back down the hallway where the gargoyles you will round a
      corner and come to some doors on the right wall. This is the kitchen. The
      cooks here are TOUGH. Much tougher than many of the others in the castle.
      The kitchen has 3 possible spawns, 2 of them being cooks, and the other
      quite often having a pet. You are getting closer to one of the most
      heavily camped spots here so this area may be cleaned out, but don't count
      on it. Past the kitchen is another room on your right and a passage. The
      room is the home of the butler; the right passage is the path to the
      maid's quarters. They are rare spawns and this camp can get tedious,
      however it can be fun if you have a good puller. On slow nights our group
      was able to pull the maid/butler, kitchen, gargoyle hallway, conference
      room, and the gypsy's music room. Our largest pull here is probably about
      12 at once between pulls and respawns, which doesn't begin to compare with
      some of our Kithicor nights, but was a lot of fun nonetheless. It was
      actually started by a doofus we added to our regular team who kept making
      trains because he kept casting camo while our bard was running mana song.
      So he continued to walk out of the room truly uncamod and ignored the fact
      we kept telling him that and he kept getting spotted. What a moron that
      guy was, but it was rather comical to see him say &quot;brb&quot; and
      within 30 seconds /shout Train to zone! One of those times I went grabbed
      his train and brought it back to alleviate our boredom. A good tight group
      can rock the castle, but it takes a puller with a clue, an enchanter that
      understand their class, and a team with balls of steel. I have been
      fortunate that I have had all of that for sometime. We typically did this
      sort of mass pull and long fights with Cailette (enchanter), Spliner<a href="../articlesold/images/maidslg.jpg"><img border="0" src="../articlesold/images/maids.jpg" align="right" width="206" height="155"></a>
      (cleric), Wyrd (ranger), and myself. The other 2 slots were filled off and
      on by other friends of ours that knew what craziness we caused up here. I
      would never do this with a pickup group, ever. We never trained the zone
      and we used my Succor spells very rarely.</p>
      <p>Ok, that covers the first floor of the castle. Now back to the main
      entranceway where the stairs when up to the second floor. Go up, through
      door and left and you will come to a couple of alcoves with various
      critters. I suggest leaving them alone if you can get by them. The next
      main room is the Princess and throne room. This is another fun place to
      be. Total in the room is about 10. If you are absolutely lucky you can
      harmony the back half and only fight the front, but don't count on luck.
      Your best bet is to bring lots of firepower, say your prayers, or call us.
      Cai, Spliner, and I did this as a threesome one-day. My pulse still races
      thinking about that one. Not only was it a nice experience ruin for 3
      people, but it was a time of fear and that makes it all worthwhile. In the
      times we have killed the Princess she never had anything of worth. She
      used to drop a very nice mace that was pulled a long time ago or is so
      rare everyone believes its been pulled. Back behind the throne is another
      door and this will lead you to some bedrooms, hot tub, the Troll SK that
      has the hilt for Soulfire and more fun stuff. I spent a little time back
      there, but most of our time was spent in all the other places. One note of
      caution though, in the bedroom that is connected to the hot tub I was
      never able to separate the bedroom spawns from the hot tub spawns. Only 2
      attempts so it is quite possible I just hadn't figured it out. We did not
      have any paladin friends we needed to do this for so I never did go back
      and try again.</p>
      <p>If I missed anything you think should be disclosed please drop me a
      line. Yes, I know I left out some. That was intentional. I wanted give a
      decent guide to my favorite Castle, but I didn't want to ruin it.
      Hopefully, I didn't give too much away.
