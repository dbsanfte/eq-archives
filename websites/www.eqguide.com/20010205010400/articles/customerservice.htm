      Originally posted (03/06/00)</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#800000">This was originally posted almost a
      year ago. Though the guide program has improved over the last year, I
      believe its still an important reminder that we are customers and good
      service is all we have ever really asked for from any company.&nbsp;</font></p>
    <hr width="50%" color="#800000">
    <p align="left">It is an absolute shame that last nights events happened
    within a week of me being told by a Verant representative that as a
    customer:</p>
      <pre>&gt; You don't DESERVE an answer.  You DESERVE to be heard, but 
&gt; you don't DESERVE an answer.  We can't answer every e-mail 
&gt; that appears. It's that simple.</pre>
    <p align="left">It is a shame because the distaste has just festered in my
    mouth since that statement and it is very hard to keep an open mind when a
    prominent individual in the company publicly states this sort of disregard
    for the people that pay his salary.</p>
    <p align="left">So lets start there. First off EVERY customer deserves a
    response to their email. Every single one of them. The argument was made
    that I have no comprehension of the email received by Verant. Well, lets
    back track on who I am then. My previous job was with America Online. I was a team leader involved with the customer service issues of member support.
    That having been said I can assure you that with somewhere near 200,000
    players Verant does not get the mail that AOL with close to 20,000,000 users
    gets. The point is a valid one that time restraints may prohibit good
    customer service at times, but even an auto responder set up for all **@verant.com
    email addresses would be better than the black holes I have emailed in the
    past. And just because time prohibits it does it no way equate to
    &quot;you don't deserve&quot;. That is poor customer service and a total
    lack of regard for the people that support your product. I have the original
    post this snippet came from if someone wants to debate the issue. I didn't
    bother to respond publicly to his statement then because I felt like he had
    just validated my angst more so than any response I could have made.</p>
      <p align="left">So lets skip forward to last night... standing on the
      stair case in Solusek Eye I had a mishap with a real life issue (read as
      needy cat wanted attention) that caused me to fall in the lava below. So I
      first went for an immediate meditate (to load gate or levitate) and found
      I couldn't due to persistent damage. DOH! Ok still calm, no panic needed I
      still have more than 4 bubbles of hit points left. Start swimming. Anyone
      that has ever grouped with me knows I am relatively calm in bad spots. 42
      damage every 3 seconds or so to whittle down 640 hit points equals about
      45 seconds. That is a lifetime in Norrath and many decisions and options
      can be weighed if you remain calm.</p>
      <p align="left">So I swam down some tunnel.. first time really in Solusek
      so I have no idea where I am going, but since I have been an active list
      serv and message board member since release and before I have heard many
      stories. I know somewhere in the lava areas there is a pseudo ledge,
      praying I can find it I hug the walls as I swim trying to climb up them.
      No luck. Then a bad situation gets worse. I zone.</p>
      <p align="left">Loading Please Wait....</p>
      <p align="left">You have entered Nagafen's Lair</p>
      <p align="left">Oh ^%$#! First off it seems I am eternally stuck
      within my first 2 bubbles of 28th level so I am at least 10 levels to
      small to even be here. I try to swim to the surface and find I am stuck. I
      can't see up, I can't move (at least to the best of my knowledge I wasn't
      moving) all I can do is try as I watch unconsciousness take over and then
      death.</p>
      <p align="left">So let's review. I have no idea where my corpse is except
      that it is in lava near a zone point from Solusek Eye. It is now in
      Nagafen's which is filled with shamans that can see invisible and whoop my
      &quot;no armor, too weak for this dungeon&quot; butt in seconds, so I can't even go
      look. Trust me we tried.</p>
      <p align="left">My long time partner has a much more optimistic attitude
      towards customer service and literally begged me to petition and state my
      case. I refused for a while, due to past experiences, and we enlisted help
      from anyone we could find. I also am a firm believer that in a
      role-playing environment there are certain hazards that are just that...
      hazards. I know, through friends in the guide program, the amount of
      pointless petitions guides get and due to that I tend to use that petition
      option as few times as I possibly can, but there are always exceptions to
      everything. I was going to do everything we possibly could before I went
      to that extreme.</p>
      <p align="left">WOW! Let me say I am still in awe at the assistance
      offered and attempted on my behalf by absolutely strangers! Many people
      deserve credit, but most importantly I want to recognize Dadugan and
      Juonon. These guys had NO REASON to assist. NONE. What can a 28th level
      druid offer 2 guys that are 15 levels above him? Ok, well maybe taxi
      services in a short while, but that's it. And of course they have it
      anytime they want.</p>
      <p align="left">I got tells from all over Norrath as my plight got spread
      throughout the world. People I didn't even know where sending suggestions
      and ideas. Most having had a friend with this experience before and <u>most
      having had a guide pull them</u> out after hours of frustration. Two
      others that deserve credit for continuing to check up on me and/or asking
      around for ideas are Tgerry and Muradin. Thank you both and to anyone else
      that took the time to offer ideas and kind words.</p>
      <p align="left">One thing I could not take was watching Dadugan's health
      dropped as he helped try and get to my body out of the lava and corpse it
      back out. He couldn't do it. Judging by the expertise and nonchalant
      attitude this was not his first time in doing this for someone. Eventually
      I couldn't take seeing his health drop and I know I would have felt
      horrible if he died so we went our separate ways and I was left at the
      mercy of the guide program.</p>
      <p align="left">Now it gets worse, for a moment at least. First petition
      is answered and I am told there is nothing that can be done, &quot;use
      levitate.&quot; Hello guide. Did you even bother to ask any questions? No.
      You gave me your canned answer so you could log and end your shift. When I
      pestered him the answer changed to &quot;a GM can, but I can't&quot;. So I
      asked for it to be escalated. He said he couldn't since no one was on.
      Then why did you tell me first there was no options, then secondly there
      is one option, but it is irrelevant to me? So I asked him to add it to
      the GM que for when there was one. No response. He logged..</p>
      <p align="left">I am not including his name due to the fact I see no need
      to blast a guide that does a piss poor job, he knows who he is and if
      Verant cares they can check petitions last night and see. I have
      screenshots of our conversation to back up this article also.</p>
      <p align="left">So my frustration and bad attitude towards poor customer
      service grows immensely. I know from other guides and friends that
      exceptions are made daily and that basically he just didn't want to hassle
      with it.</p>
      <p align="left">Next step. Repetition. Main reason I repetitioned is a
      guide that I have had a past GREAT experience with as another character
      was online. I was just praying she would get the call. She will get her
      name plastered here, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE don't bug her. I would hate to
      see a guide get 1000 tells because she does her job well. That is not fair
      to her. I am only stating her name because she deserves credit for a job
      well done! She is Shria.</p>
      <p align="left">Shria responded to the new petition and immediately began
      asking questions as to the nature of the situation. The first guide never
      asked one question. Just said too bad so sad. Explaining that I can not
      even walk past the first room of the dungeon I zoned while under lava and
      that we had enlisted multiple people to assist and they were unable to get
      to my body she went to check it out. She found I was in a bugged section of
      the zone and that even in perfect conditions I would not be able to
      retrieve it. She attempted to do so using her &quot;mortal&quot; powers
      and could not either. She even explained (covered his ass as customer
      service people have to do for others sometimes) why she felt I got such a
      poor response from the first guide. Sorry Shria, your points are taken to
      heart, but he just wasn't doing his job. You on the other hand did. You
      asked questions. You evaluated the situation and based your decisions and
      your actions on the issues at hand. Not on a macro answer of &quot;we cant
      do that it's against policy&quot;.</p>
      <p align="left">Shria and I spoke for about 15 minutes as she checked
      things out and heard my explanation of the situation. Being able to assert
      that my corpse was basically in a bugged location she had me file a bug
      report as to what happened and assisted me with getting the corpse at
      least in an area of Nagafen's I could loot it. She turned a horrific
      experience into one I will remember positively for the rest of my EQ days.</p>
      <p align="left">Now is this a risk or hazard of the game that should just
      be seen as a death and left alone? Well, maybe. A couple of reasons I
      don't think so...</p>
      <p align="left">1. I am a pretty level headed player and did all I could
      to find a way to get to safety and still died. Now zoned into a dungeon I
      can't even fight my way through to find my corpse. A ledge placed inside
      the lava areas, or walls you can climb at least out of damage areas would
      alleviate that issue.</p>
      <p align="left">2. If I had not been able to retrieve my corpse I would
      have lost countless items and hours of playtime trying to replenish them.
      A few items I would never be able to replace... i.e. nodrop quest items
      from quests I am too big to do again or have had faction go bad with due
      to other quests.</p>
      <p align="left">In my case I play 8-10 hours a day average. I have many
      friends in Norrath and multiple characters so could have probably very
      easily come up with 3000 or more platinum in a day or so to try and
      replace everything. Ligge has never been twinked. I was not looking
      forward to doing it either, but to play with the people and in the areas
      for my level it was going to be an almost necessity, especially with the
      new right of way policy.</p>
      <p align="left">Guide: &quot;Umm excuse me Ligge why are you camping
      Lenrel?&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">Ligge: &quot;Because I died to lava and this worn great
      staff and patchwork is not quite enough for a level 28 to fight anywhere.
      So I am getting an RTS and snakeskin&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">Guide: &quot;Please leave, you must come back or buy your
      stuff&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">Of course, due to friends, massive hours I can play, and
      the twinking we would have had to do, that would not have been the case.
      However, lets look at &quot;Little Johnny&quot;..</p>
      <p align="left">Johnny has been playing since March 16th. He is a level 24
      druid who solos mostly because he only gets to play an hour a day due to
      school, homework, and part time job. With that sort of time allotment
      grouping is NOT an option. He has been hanging out fighting Tentacle
      Terrors in Najena and has grown a little bored and decided to explore a
      bit in Lavastorm an stumbles onto Solusek Eye.</p>
      <p align="left">Upon entering he makes his way down the stairs to the
      first platform near where the Cinder Goblins tend to be. No MOBs around so
      he stands for a second, can't con anything to even know what level the
      dungeon is, and BAM train come around the corner and he freaks, backs up,
      and SPLAT... lava. Swims like I did and ends up in Nagafen's. Has little
      or no friends in Norrath due to his hour a day issue. So he has no choice
      but to petition. The ordeal from start to finish took me 3.5 hours last
      night. Over 2 hours for me from the first petition until resolution.
      Johnny doesn't have that time. Johnny loses everything and reasonably
      can't recoup it very easily.</p>
      <p align="left">Johnny will quit. Johnny will bad mouth Verant, 989 and EQ
      to all of his friends. This is the Everquest customer base and by all
      means the 989 customer base with Playstation games etc etc. If
      he had gotten the same response I had from the first guide the damage
      would have been done and probably irreversible. An unhappy customer tells
      10 people, a happy one tells 1.</p>
      <p align="left">Well, unless you are me and have this site, I tell 1000s
      of people either way.</p>
      <p align="left">To kind of wrap this up, if that is possible, Shria
      redeemed many months of bad customer service caused by past guide
      experiences and poorly made Verant developer comments (the you don't
      DESERVE an answer) in about 15 minutes of time. How did she do that? She
      LISTENED to the customer and asked questions. So for those of you guides
      that see this, its really an easy thing to do, listen, ask questions, put
      yourself in the customers shoes, and evaluate the situation. I had
      absolutely no way of recovering my body without a guides assistance. None.
      After Shria checked this out she found out that to be true. The first
      guide didn't bother.</p>
      <p align="left">Another thing that comes out of this is to remember when
      someone calls for help, <u>help them</u>, next time it may be you. I know
      that there have been many times I have stopped whatever I was doing to go
      assist someone that I didn't know, but I knew I was one of the best
      available (levitate, SoW, cure poison, disease, etc)&nbsp; to help them so
      I did it. Did I receive anything for all those altruistic moments? Yes,
      last night people did the same for me... almost brings a tear to your eye
      doesn't it.&nbsp; ;-)</p>
      <p align="left">And a note to Shria... hopefully this gets passed to you
      eventually.. THANK YOU. Thank you for taking the time to ask questions,
      thank you for taking the time to evaluate the situation. Thank you for
      being a guide. If there were more people like you the world would be a
      better place. I truly hope this article doesn't cause you any difficulties,
      but damn it people deserve to know there are guides like you out there.
      &lt;whisper&gt; That proposal offer is still open, but I really don't
      think I could truly quit hunting Tier'dal... &lt;wink&gt;</p>
      <p align="left">And a note to Brad... you made a comment last week about
      the &quot;right of way&quot; policy and that it would be at the discretion
      of the guides to determine how to resolve each issue. I also understand
      that guides are forwarding all cases straight to GMs. Going by what just
      happened to me... that is badly flawed. First that first guide had no
      discretionary ability to determine anything since he didn't even take the
      time to ask one single question. Secondly, there were no GMs online so he
      couldn't have forwarded it up for some that does have discretionary
      abilities. The issue you responded to was concerning a level 38 camping a
      level 32 spawn and you said that he would be ok because he still got
      experience. I asked 2 guides and they said they have no way to determine
      who gets experience from what. You do because, well its your world, but an
      average guide does not have your knowledge. Anyway it all revolves around
      providing adequate customer service and I truly believe you have that in
      mind due to comments you have made before, its a shame some of your
      cohorts don't seem to be of the same mindset. So if we are going to leave
      issues to the discretion, which I don't disagree with, of the guides/GMs
      give them some more tools to do their job.</p>
      <p align="left">You know what? Even if Shria had determined I was in a
      &quot;too bad so sad&quot; situation I still would have left last night a
      happy customer due to her at least taking the time and pleasantly checking
      things out for me. A little concern shown goes a long way.</p>
