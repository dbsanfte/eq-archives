      <p>As you can likely guess, as soon as I passed the 8th
      test of knowledge in my craft, and had learned the beginnings of
      transmuting metals, I quickly apprenticed myself to a well-known jeweler.
      I would like to thank Liriela, the first Teir'Dal resident of Rivervale
      (Ligge took me home to meet the folks) for her kindness in talking the
      Teir'Dal scribes into letting her borrow the scroll for me to study. I
      stayed with my Master listening to his teachings and watching his
      techniques until I had passed the 21 tests he set for me. It was both a
      joyous day and a melancholy day when my Master told me that I now had all
      the knowledge he could impart to me. I was now on my own to learn the
      secrets held by each gem and each metal combination.</p>
      <p>As, Ligge and Kjella can tell you, during those early days after
      leaving my Master, I scraped and saved every coin I came across. I spent
      lots of time in the taverns talking with travelers to see what sort of
      jewelry they would find of greatest use. It was my habit to gather up my
      coin until I had enough to pay the scribe keepers to let me study the next
      rank of spells I would need to continue study in my craft. Once I had
      gathered their fees, I would rush off to purchase silver bars. I would
      then proceed to the nearest lapidary. I went slowly learning the
      properties of each gem, which would take what sort of a setting, which
      stones had which innate magical qualities. I had to start with the least
      expensive stone until I had learned its secrets.</p>
      <p>Once I had passed the 12th test of knowledge in my craft, a strange
      comet, or at least the gnomes in the Lesser Faydark told me it was a
      comet, passed over Norrath. It swept across the face of the lands, near to
      the surface. In it's passing, it changed the magical properties innate in
      all the gems found in the land. After hearing that the comet had changed
      the nature of the stones, I took all of my remaining funds and quickly
      tried crafting some items with the stones whose nature I had already
      mastered. Finally, many of the pieces of jewelry the tavern patrons had
      mused of having were possible!!!! And the birth of a merchant jeweler had
      happened. However, an unfortunate event happened at this point in my
      crafting career. While running through RunnyEye with a bag full of newly
      crafted jewelry, a goblin must have snuck behind me and emptied my pack. I
      loudly proclaimed the wares I had crafted for any who were interested in
      them in the Plains of the Karanas and found to my embarrassment that all
      my wares were gone. Flat broke =(</p>
      <p>Well, after crying over my losses in the fine brew that Ligge gave me,
      I decided to focus on my studies to learn more of the process of
      transmuting metals. This decision turned out to be a good one, since it
      allowed me to mass up a small pile of coin to spend learning the secrets
      of the new metal, electrum, that I could transmute once I had passed the
      16th test of knowledge. It took all of my small pile of coin to learn even
      the basics of the metal electrum. I must confess though that I did have an
      eye towards items that the tavern patrons had mentioned wistfully in my
      earlier days. There had been many a druid who sighed about bracelets that
      would capture an animal friend's attention long enough that they could
      cast a magical charm over them. Of course those of my own craft also
      sighed wistfully over such bracelets as well, but we also coveted
      bracelets rumored to add both our life essence and magic energy, while
      adding a small protective shield. And well, jade is just such a pretty
      stone, and we enchanters can be a rather vain crowd. Others who practiced
      the magical arts mentioned an interest in wearing jade as well. Various
      priestly types had heard rumor of magical earrings which would whisper
      words of wisdom in their ears. Monks had sighed over rings that would make
      them move with such agility that their foes would not know where they
      truly stood. So I spent every spare moment that we were not out
      adventuring and learning the lands working on my skills at forming the
      transmuted metals and gems into new creations. Then I would find a corner
      of a local tavern and display the goods I had crafted.</p>
      <p>I was beginning to build a name for myself as a merchant jeweler by
      this time. I always kept a pack full of jewelry on me as I ran about the
      world adventuring. I would call out my wares for any nearby who had an
      interest to inquire. I found that I generally earned enough to keep
      crafting and increasing my skill by offering my wares for purchase. Now,
      the knowledge of transmuting gold was in sight. That would be my next
      goal, since there were even more baubles that travelers had mentioned on
      their wish list available for me.</p>
      <p>As soon as possible I set myself to achieving the 24th test of
      knowledge in my craft. I memorized the scrolls explaining how gold could
      be transmuted, then ran to buy bars of gold and gems. Again I started with
      the least expensive stone that crafted a product that I'd heard others
      dreaming about in the taverns. Again, I carried a variety of pieces on me
      at all time. By this time I had definitely built myself a name as a
      jeweler. I was very fortunate in having a partner, who was able to travel
      easily, which gave me more exposure in more places as we went from place
      to place seeking adventure. By this time I was making a slight profit at
      my crafting, so I started saving for the rumored expense of gaining the
      skill to craft platinum jewelry. I'd heard tales of fortunes of 10,000
      platinum pieces burned in not time crafting platinum.</p>
      <p>I almost gave up crafting as I started closing in on the skill level
      needed to craft platinum. Those skill level to get into the range to try
      crafting platinum are long, expensive and time consuming. They burned
      through much of my savings. But I did finally get near the point I could
      start attempting crafting platinum pieces. I had long since passed my 34th
      test of knowledge. Platinum is an unusual metal. Although it may seem to
      be transmuted correctly when casting the spell on it, often times when
      combined with the various gems the metal and gem break into bits and are
      lost beyond repair. Even after gaining the ultimate in knowledge of
      crafting, these pieces often fail. I will discuss pricing, haggling and
      twinkie jewelers in another article.</p>
      <p>In retrospect, in giving advice to an aspiring jeweler, I would suggest
      waiting a bit to begin crafting. If I had not been partnered with Ligge,
      many of my expenses would have been higher for many different things.
      Ligge kept us both fed with his skill in foraging nature's bounty. He was
      generous with me when we gather loot from our vanquished foes, always let
      me have items with magical properties we came across in our travels first.
      He also saved any and all gems he gathered a booty for me to practice
      with. So in terms of pure start up costs, I was fortunate in my youth. I
      would suggest any aspiring jeweler wait until they have earned their
      surname before starting to craft. The other thing I have noticed is that
      as more and more people pursue jewel crafting as a trade, fewer and fewer
      people have need of items. I again was fortunate in being able to turn my
      profits back into my craft. I am not certain that a new jeweler would have
      the same success I did, when training my skills.</p>
      <p><font SIZE="2">A few more words of advice for any aspiring jewelers out
      there:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Your reputation is your trade.</li>
        <li>Be fair, but firm.</li>
        <li>Price where you are making a profit so that you may stay in
          business, but not so that you are taking advantage of your fellows. My
          prices currently reflect the average cost of making the item with 10
          to 30 platinum profit margin built into it. I currently trade mostly
          in platinum jewelry, with special orders done for special friends.</li>
        <li>Leave the lower end markets to those learning the trade. You
          struggled through it too.</li>
        <li>When you are on a streak where nothing you try shapes itself as you
          would like, stop. Being stubborn can cost you the ability to stay in
          business as a jeweler.</li>
        <li>Most importantly, become a jeweler because you love to see the
          beautiful pieces you can create. Jeweling is time consuming, a labor
          of love. It is not a path to quick riches. Only a select few will get
          rich jeweling, and there is little market for pure cash transactions.
          However there is some satisfaction in being able to &quot;treat&quot;
          your group to a trip to the Plane of Sky….. I keep dreaming of it.</li>
        <li>Use any secret mojo you think helps you to successfully craft the
          pieces you are working on…. You never know, there might be something
          to it &lt;wink&gt;</li>
      </ul>
