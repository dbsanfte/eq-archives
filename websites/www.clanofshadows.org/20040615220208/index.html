Snake poo tastes horrible. I think, I think I really hate you both for your neglect, all this time and not even one note back while your only son sat torn, and ... well, torn's bad enough. <BR><BR>I've left the temple now, crawled through sand and rocky hill on my hands, unable to move my legs, with the occasional passerby taking enough time to fuck me in the ass, which has been numb for seven weeks now, but not staying long enough to throw me a CH, or a partial CH, or whatever the hell that sad excuse for a CH is that shaman get. <BR><BR>Heh, I guess that's just shamans though, all talk. I mean, you can feel their spirit dog pets going in more than you can the average shammy. When you're smaller than a ghost, you have a negative penis. Anyways, yah, where was I? <BR><BR>I guess, I'm living proof of the reality of the term "fucking their brains out" these days. I'm surpised I don't have a hearty cocktail of snake, ogre, ranger and others love pudge forcing my brains out my ears. <BR><BR>I haven't been able to feel much lately, physically or emotionally, then again, I did steal some pills from a member of SotN, so, that might explain it. The crazy stuff I saw them do... it was crazy. <BR><BR>Dad, ever seen a man try and make love to a brick? For a moment around those guys, I actually envied my current fate. <BR><BR>I got it by the way, stole the sword the same way I got the keys to my first car from my old high-school principal. After jerking the emporer guy off until he passed out, I just picked the thing up and walked away. Thanks again dad, I could have never done it without all you and the mailman taught me, I know you'll be proud. <BR><BR>Mom on the otherhand, I'm sorry, I know how much you cried when I talked about dad and the mailman but, don't feel bad for me, I learned a lot and yeah, like all training it hurt, but, I think it helped me become a man. <BR><BR>I still miss all my friends back home, at least, those I exposed myself to frequently. There's a certain bond you make with someone when you tie them up and slap them with your dick for a few hours. Heh, what goes around comes around I guess, my cheeks are still red from my time in Ssra- ... Cheraiz... the temple. <BR><BR>Now though, I know full well I'll never have to go back there. I'll never have to cope with the cold touch of a warm stranger, I'll never have to respond to a foriegn, gruff voice huffing into my ear at 5am. I've bent over more than Micheal Jacksons kids have by now. I've probably taken more cock too =/ <BR><BR>I'm never going back, that's for sure, it smells worse in their than my room did after mom and that vah shir girl used it for the PPTA meetings. Why the PPTA was composed of only two women I'll never know. You guys sure did like your tuna... <BR><BR>I'm almost to shadowhaven now ... a nice man put me up for the night after... putting himself up for the night. <BR><BR>I think I'm gunna give up on being a paladin, man-sluts are much more appreciated. <BR><BR>Life is worse than my deepest nightmares, and better than the most wholesome of daydreams. <BR><BR>My ass hurts so fucking much. <BR><BR>~Prawn. <BR></FONT></SPAN><BR><IMG src="http://clanofshadows.org/killpix/February%202004/Prawn.PNG"><BR><br><HR><br><BR><br><P align=center><FONT color=#cc66ff><FONT color=white>More Artwork brought to you by&nbsp;Marken!&nbsp; (Who bots a l33t cleric, not fuckhole druids named "Whazz")<BR><BR><SPAN class=postbody><IMG style="WIDTH: 600px; HEIGHT: 363px" height=690 src="http://loganthirteen.hypermart.net/fenlaanfinal.jpg" width=629 border=0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR><SPAN class=postbody><IMG style="WIDTH: 500px; HEIGHT: 360px" height=720 src="http://loganthirteen.hypermart.net/atyour.jpg" width=418 border=0></SPAN><BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <IMG alt="" src="http://loganthirteen.hypermart.net/markreyneava.jpg" border=0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <SPAN class=postbody><IMG style="WIDTH: 333px; HEIGHT: 214px" height=546 src="http://loganthirteen.hypermart.net/axon.jpg" width=579 border=0></SPAN><BR></SPAN></FONT></FONT><FONT color=#cc66ff><FONT color=white><SPAN class=postbody><BR><br><HR><br><BR></SPAN></FONT></FONT><br><P></P>This is a CoS Brain:<BR><BR><FONT color=#cc66ff><FONT color=white><SPAN class=postbody><FONT color=white><SPAN class=postbody><IMG style="WIDTH: 444px; HEIGHT: 278px" height=507 src="http://loganthirteen.hypermart.net/Icelyb.jpg" width=784 border=0><BR><BR></SPAN>This is a CoS brain on drugs:<BR><BR><br><P><IMG style="WIDTH: 514px; HEIGHT: 351px" height=464 src="http://fenlaan.clanofshadows.org/pics/Ice.jpg" width=548 border=0><BR><BR>Any questions?<BR><BR><BR><br><HR><br></FONT></SPAN></FONT></FONT><br><P align=center><FONT color=#cc66ff><FONT color=white><SPAN class=postbody>CoS is an&nbsp;Equal Opportunity Recruiter.<BR><BR><IMG style="WIDTH: 502px; HEIGHT: 316px" height=314 src="http://clanofshadows.org/killpix/February%202004/gangsta.jpg" width=314><BR><IMG src="http://clanofshadows.org/killpix/February%202004/Ozz.PNG"></SPAN></FONT></FONT></P><br><P><FONT color=#cc66ff><FONT color=white><SPAN class=postbody><FONT color=#cc66ff><FONT color=white><br><HR><br><BR>Although CoS is now raiding the Elemental Planes regularly, we still have several backflagging agreements.
