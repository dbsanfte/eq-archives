I don’t think I care about much these days. It’s come to the point that I show up to this cold, unforgiving place week after week, only to be reamed worse than Stacy Valentine in … well … in everything she’d ever had a part in.<br> There are several of those weird talkers here...<br> Dad, it’s like the dentist office, except it’s not my teeth being drilled. ;__;<br> Yeah by that I mean it’s my ASS!! Snakes, men, women, even rangers have had their turn. I haven’t the slightest idea why they would, the last ogre who came by even said I was lose and well you know about -rangers-. At least, I think mom does, I know what happened when dad was hanging out with that Beastlord.<br> I swear this fucking Sword and Shield are harder to get to than a Straight Edge prom date!!!!<br>I’m sorry, I’m sorry but it’s just, it hurts mom, and I don’t just mean my ass … some crazy enchanter tried to jam his snake in my eye. I wish I had a visor. Everyone else gets a visor, and all I have is this piece of shit that looks like an old football helmet.<br>I mean, I really thought this year, after he took me behind the enchanted village and told me he had a special candy-cane for me I’d get something cool from Santa. It didn’t even taste like peppermint.<br>Nothing tastes like peppermint anymore.<br> I guess this is growing up…<br><br> ~Prawn.<br><br> </FONT><SPAN class=postbody><FONT size=2>Dear Mom and Dad:<br>Hey again. I know it's been a long while since I last wrote, and I'm sorry. Don't hit me, it won't happen again, or will happen again. I hate when I confuse myself. Anyways, I got those cookies you sent me, they tasted a bit funky. Were they macaroons? <br>I'm still in the temple, but this time no one's here but the snakes, oh and like, seven of those guys who talk weird, and this ranger who keeps staring at my ass. I don't understand why, maybe he thinks I'm gunna crap myself.<br>Is it common for rangers to look at other guys butts? I know I've caught dad doing it a few times, but he's a beastlord. Dad, maybe you can field this one for me? Why do you and your ranger friend always check each other out? Are you practicing for when you see a darkelf?<br> Anywho, I'm getting kinda sick to my stomach, I ate some pills I found on the floor while waiting for this emporer guy. He sure is slow. I hope he's not like Santa and makes me sit on his lap... last time I went to the mall Santas lap was all pokey, and I never did get that Megazord I wanted for Christmas. He kept calling me a bad bad boy... Santa's weird.<br>Gotta go mom and dad, some guy's inspecting my equipment ... and it feels wrong.<br>Take care!<br><br> ~Prawn<br><br> </FONT></SPAN></FONT></FONT></SPAN><SPAN class=postbody><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT color=#ff9933><SPAN class=postbody><SPAN class=postbody><FONT size=2>Dear Auntie Marcus:<br> The two women said I should leave my equipment elsewhere, and I started to cry. This letter may be stained with teardrops and I'm sorry.<br>For the last two hours I've cried a lot.<br>The first time was when that ranger stopped starring, I didn't know rangers had backstab. I'll tell you this, I now know why it's so damaging. It's a plug and jolt thing, there's no cuddling like when I used to sleep over at your house.<br>Speaking oh which, how's uncle Greg? Does he still boss you around? Does he still beat you? I remember hearing you groan and cry out those nights I stayed in your basement. I don't know why you keep him around Auntie, he's nothing but bad news. <br>Have you two moved into a house yet? You always said how much you liked comming in through the back door when you were younger, and I know you've lived in an apartment for, for forever as far as I can remember. It was so confusing.<br> I get confused a lot, like this woman this morning asked me why I wasn't a bard. She kept saying guys with inadequet equipment tend to sing to express their emotions, so I should be a bard. I didn't understand it cause, well, I have pretty cool armor. At least I think it's pretty cool. Unfortunately I've gotta go, that rangers back, and I think he's trying to rob me, cause he just grinned and took off my greaves.<br>I hate this place Auntie.<br> I hate it so much.<br><br> ~Prawn<br><br> </FONT></SPAN><SPAN class=postbody><FONT size=2>Dear Fluffy, the stuffed bear I sodomized in my youth:<br> Hey guy, it's been a long time. You miss me? I know there have been nights I've missed you. <br>Okay, okay, joking aside. I think I'm in this temple for the long run fluffy, and it's looking bleak. I'm still pretty much alone. That ranger earlier got his bag and took off like I was a McDonalds drive through. I can truely say I know what it's like to feel used. Because of this Fluffy, I wanted to apologize to you, for all those nights I did the same.<br> You deserved more, you deserved love, I should have lubed my stick but all I did was shove. <br>That one was for you old friend. The rejection passed, as most things do, and I got over it the way dad used to help me feel better. I played with myself until my junk went numb. It was like highschool all over again.<br> The stragglers still watch me, like I was the last peanut M&amp;M, and they were some kind of nut munchers. I'm scared, and I really wish you were here. No, no, I wish I was there Fluffy, there in the shed where the mailman taught me how to love.<br> I always wondered what happened to him, have you heard anything? Of course not ... you're inanimate. Most of the beautiful things are, they don't lust, they just lay there, content, and dead.<br> This place makes me wish I was Fluffy.<br> And I don't mean content.<br> My bum hurts.<br><br> ~Prawn.<br><br></FONT></SPAN></SPAN></FONT></FONT></SPAN><FONT color=#cc66cc><SPAN class=postbody><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><SPAN class=postbody><SPAN class=postbody> </SPAN></SPAN></FONT></SPAN>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</FONT></P><P><FONT size=4>Wanted to share some of our latest Artwork with you fine people, compliments of Marken:</FONT> <IMG style="WIDTH: 255px; HEIGHT: 215px" height=344 src="http://clanofshadows.org/killpix/November/Marken%20Art/Ass.jpg" width=317>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <IMG style="WIDTH: 212px; HEIGHT: 220px" height=570 src="http://clanofshadows.org/killpix/November/Marken%20Art/Zeemus.jpg" width=560>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <IMG style="WIDTH: 197px; HEIGHT: 229px" height=570 src="http://clanofshadows.org/killpix/November/Marken%20Art/MnL.jpg" width=427>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <IMG style="WIDTH: 484px; HEIGHT: 432px" height=978 src="http://clanofshadows.org/killpix/November/Marken%20Art/Mistress.jpg" width=924></P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>&nbsp;</P>    </font></td>  </tr>  </table></center><br>
