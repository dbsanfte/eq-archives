The Grand Historian next to him will tell you what to say to him if you hail him. Borannin will ask you to bring back to him four frost giant toes. Frost giant toes seem to drop randomly of all frost giants. Giving him the toes results in faction changes (+Coldain, +DainFrostreaverIV, -Kromzek, -Kromrif) and a Burlap Coldain Prayer Shawl. He says to bring the shawl back to him in one months time and he will have more for you to do, so this is probably the start of a quest series.<BR><BR>Burlap Coldain Prayer Shawl&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<BR>LORE ITEM MAGIC ITEM NO DROP<BR>AC: +1 Wis: +1 Int: +1 Cold Resist: +1<BR>Weight: 1.0<BR>Classes: All Classes<BR>Races: All Races<BR>Inventory Slot: Shoulder<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<BR><B>Cloth Coldain Prayer Shawl</B> <BR><BR>You say, 'What task'<BR><BR>Loremaster Borannin says 'Every year the Dain replaces the trophies in his trophy room. There is a reward given for the best new trophy obtained. I intend to win this year and I will upgrade your prayer shawl for assisting me. Fill this box with ten Kromrif heads and bring me the combined contents along with the burlap shawl. I will submit the best one for the Dains consideration.<BR><BR>He then gives you a Preservationists Box. Fill the box with 10 Kromrif Heads and hit combine to make a box of Preserved Kromrif Heads. Then give Borannin Preserved Kromrif Heads box along with Burlap Coldain Prayer Shawl.<BR><BR>Loremaster Borannin says 'Ahh, some fine specimens indeed, Devastation. I will have the best of these mounted at once, wish me luck in the contest! Before I forget, here is the Cloth Prayer Shawl of our people. Before long I will have yet another [chore] for you to complete. Be sure to keep checking.<BR><BR>Your faction standing with Coldain got better<BR>Your faction standing with DainFrostreaverIV got better<BR>Your faction standing with Kromzek got worse<BR>Your faction standing with Kromrif got worse<BR><BR>Cloth Coldain Prayer Shawl&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<BR>LORE ITEM MAGIC ITEM NO DROP<BR>AC: +2 Wis: +2 Int: +2 Cold Resist: +2<BR>Weight: 2.0<BR>Classes: All Classes<BR>Races: All Races<BR>Inventory Slot: Shoulder<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<BR><B>Woven Coldain Prayer Shawl</B> <BR><BR>You say, 'What chore?'<BR><BR>Loremaster Borannin says 'The council agrees that you have demonstrated a disdain for our enemy, the Kromrif, that rivals our own. They now ask that you demonstrate your loyalty to the Dain by humbling yourself and serving our people. Give this, my seal, to Mordrin. He will instruct you further.<BR><BR>Borannin tells you to go to Mordrin, but that is a typo, he really means Mordin, the guy in the butcher shop.<BR><BR>You say, 'hail Mordin Frostcleaver'<BR><BR>Mordin Frostcleaver says 'Ah, hello there, and welcome to me shop, Halfling. Ye'll have to excuse the mess but I've been havin a bloody good time here lately. . . HAR HAR, ye get it? Anyways, thanks to you offlanders I now have a selection of some exotic meats never afore seen here on Velious. In addition to supplyin' the freshest meat in Thurgadin I also offer tasks to would-be hunters in the wastes.<BR><BR>I gave Mordin Borannin's seal and he said the following.<BR><BR>Mordin Frostcleaver says 'Hullo Soandso , I see you've signed on for a bit of food service eh? Well we can always use an extra pair a hands here dat's fer sure. First things first, warsh yer grubby mitts an cook up dinner fer good ol Leif. Shouldn’t be too tough fer ye, he has simple enough taste. Make him a Tundrabear sandwich an lemme know when he's been fed. Dontcha ferget ta give him this with his meal.<BR>Your faction standing with Coldain &amp; DainFrostreaverIV got better<BR>Your faction standing with Kromzek &amp; Kromrif got worse<BR><BR>He gives you a napkin named "Leif's Napkin" is No Drop.<BR><BR>You say, 'What is a Tundrabear Sandwich?'<BR><BR>Mordin Frostcleaver says 'Dat's easy, ye just take a slab a dat Tundra Kodiak meat and a jug a sauce, put it in da oven, den combine the product with a loaf a bread in a mixin bowl an there ye be.<BR><BR>Get a Tundra Kodiak meat, put it in oven with sauce and make "Saucy Kodiak Meat" (name?). Put your creation in a mixing bowl with one loaf of bread, which Mordin sells, and combine. If your skill is high enough you get the sandwich. Turn this in to Guard Leif with the napkin and get a "Used Napkin" back. It is also No Drop.<BR><BR>Give the used napkin to Mordin and get the next part of the quest. He needs you to make some Snow Bunny Stew for Trita Coldheart (name?). You get "Trita's Napkin" (No Drop).<BR><BR>You say, 'What is Snow Bunny Stew'<BR><BR>Mordin Frostcleaver says 'Simple enuff, getcherself two hunksa Bunny meat and a jug a sauces. Stir 'em in a mixin bowl, then put spices and two flasks a water with it and cook it in a pot. Mmmm, zesty!<BR><BR>The tough part here is finding a mixing bowl. I searched several cities including Thurgadin for a mixing bowl or even a mixing bowl sketch or mold.<BR>Once you mix the ingredients in the bowl and get your "Saucy Rabbit"(name?) you put that, one spice, 2 flasks of water and a pot into the oven to make the stew. The pot can be made with the smithing skill, and maybe even pottery, although I hadn't worked on that at this point.<BR><BR>I gave the stew to Trita with the Napkin and received a dirty pot in return. I gave that back to Mordin and was given the next part of the quest.<BR><BR>Next you need to createan Ulthork Meat Pie for Brita. You receive Brita's napkin, No Drop.<BR><BR>You say, 'What is Ulthork Meat Pie?'<BR><BR>Mordin Frostcleaver says 'Hmm, lemme look that one up. Been awhile since I made one. Here we are, two Ulthork meats, a vinegar and a spices in a mixin bowl. Put yer meat mix, a clump a dough, an a pie tin in da oven an yer good ta go.<BR><BR>This requires 2 Ulthork meat, and the problem here is that if you're not careful you will eat the meat. Most of the items you need to collect or make are edible. I could not find any snake eggs in Thurgadin for the clump of dough, so I ported to Misty Thicket to get them. The pie tin is another stumbling block here unless you are good at smithing and pottery, or you have a friend who is. To smith the Pie Tin you first need to make a ceramic lining, so your pottery has to be trained somewhat. I had relatively good success with a 25 pottery, whereas my smithing is in the low 100's and I don't think the pie tin is trivial to me yet. Luckily the pie tin, and the pot in the previous step, are regular items that anyone can craft and give to you if you lack the proper skills.<BR><BR>Turn the pie and the napkin in to Loremaster Brita in the back of the Library and receive a dirty pie tin which you take back to Mordin for the final step in this quest.<BR><BR>The final task is to create a Snow Griffin Souffle. The person you are making this for is none other than the Grand Historian Thoridain himself, so it has to be made well. I have worked my baking up to 115, and I don't remember the soufflé being trivial to me.<BR><BR>You say, 'What is Snow Griffin Soufflé?'<BR><BR>Mordin Frostcleaver says 'This one's a bit tricky, ya toss four snow griffin eggs and a pack of spices in de oven. Ye must bake it just right or it's all gunna be wasted. When yer done bring it to Thoridain and if ye did it right he'll give ye his special seal. Just show Borannin that seal and yer shawl and he'll know that yer finished in the kitchen.<BR><BR>So now you need 4 <?xml:namespace prefix = st1 ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags" /><st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Griffin</st1:place></st1:City> eggs. I had never seen any drop up to this point, but I haven't killed a lot of Griffs either. I set out and with a little help was able to get 4 eggs to drop in about 3 hours. It would have gone faster, but I had trouble finding the Griffins. All in all I'd say we got the 4 eggs in about 12 - 15 Griffins, maybe even less.<BR><BR>Once you've made the soufflé turn it in to Grand Historian Thoridain with the napkin.<BR>Grand Historian Thoridain says 'My compliments, Soandso, what a wonderful dish! Please accept my personal Seal as a token of my appreciation. May it give you power over your adversaries.<BR>Your faction standing with Coldain &amp; DainFrostreaverIV got better<BR>Your faction standing with Kromzek &amp; Kromrif got worse<BR><BR>He gives you his Seal to give to Borannin with your second Prayer Shawl.<BR><BR>Loremaster Borannin says 'Well done Soandso, the council will be impressed with your effort. Here is the woven prayer shawl, wear it with pride. I know there is talk of great plans for you, be sure to come back and ask me what the council has [brewing].<BR>Your faction standing with Coldain &amp; DainFrostreaverIV got better<BR>Your faction standing with Kromzek &amp; Kromrif got worse<BR><BR>For those who want it summed up, here is a shopping list of items you will need to do the whole quest. This assumes no failures, so plan accordingly:<BR><BR>1 Tundra Kodiak Meat (Non-stackable)<BR>2 Jug of Sauces (Stackable)<BR>1 Loaf of Bread (Stackable)<BR>1 Mixing Bowl (Container)<BR>4 Snow Griffin Eggs (Stackable, No Drop)<BR>3 Spices (Stackable)<BR>2 Snow Bunny Meat (Non-stackable)<BR>2 Flasks of Water (Stackable)<BR>1 Pot (Non-stackable, Not a container)<BR>2 Ulthork Meat (Stackable, edible)<BR>1 Vinegar (Stackable)<BR>1 Snake Egg (Stackable)<BR>1 Bottle of Milk (Stackable)<BR>1 Cup Flower (Stackable)<BR>1 Pie Tin (Non-stackable, Not a container)<BR><BR>Woven Coldain Prayer Shawl&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<BR>LORE ITEM MAGIC ITEM NO DROP<BR>AC: +3 Wis: +3 Int: +3 Cold Resist: +3<BR>Weight: 2.0<BR>Classes: All Classes<BR>Races: All Races<BR>Inventory Slot: Shoulder<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<BR>Seal of Thoridain&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<BR>LORE ITEM MAGIC ITEM NO DROP<BR>AC: +3 Wis: +3 Int: +3 Magic Resist: +3 Cold Resist: +3 Mana: +30<BR>Weight: 1.0<BR>Classes: All Classes<BR>Races: All Races<BR>Inventory Slot: Ranged Weapon<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<BR><B>Fur-Lined Coldain Shawl</B> <BR><BR>After you finish the third quest, Ask Loremaster Borannin 'what is brewing?'<BR><BR>Loremaster Borannin says 'Ahh yes, good to see you again Soandso . I wish it were under better circumstances that we meet today. For<BR>some time now we have sent teams of our finest rogues to gather intelligence for the Dain. Tanik Greskil is one of our best. He was recently sent into the heart of Kael Drakkel on a very important mission and has not returned. He is now long overdue, and fearing the worst, our wise council has asked me to dispatch a rescue party to determine what has become of him and return him to safety. I have decided to give you this opportunity to build upon the trust you have earned from the council. Will you accept this mission?<BR><BR>You say, 'i will accept this mission'<BR><BR>Loremaster Borannin says 'The council will be pleased to hear of your acceptance, Soandso . Scour the regions surrounding the city of the<BR>Giants. Discover what happened to Tanik and, if possible, return him to Thurgadin. If you are successful, remember to hand me your woven shawl. We seem to be running low on them, but I must say Mordin has never had so much help in the kitchen. Anyway, I will eagerly await word of your findings. Good luck, and may Brell protect you.<BR><BR>If you wander around the Eastern Wastes near NEG 6644 POS 4337 you will hopefully eventually see a message "the snow crumbles away revealing an injured coldain" or something like that. This reveals Tanik Greskil.<BR><BR>You say, 'hail Tanik Greskil'<BR><BR>Tanik Greskil says 'Outlander! Thank Brell you've found me! I am the last surviving member of my unit. Our mission was somehow compromised, the bloody Kromrif knew just where to find us... I can't imagine how they knew. I was barely able to escape with my life and wandered into a trap here. I am badly hurt and need your help.<BR><BR>You say, 'i will help'<BR><BR>Tanik Greskil says 'Quickly, give me a vial of Velium Vapors so I can return home, I am in desperate need of some attention from our clerics.<BR><BR>You say, 'what is velium vapors'<BR><BR>Tanik Greskil says 'Drat! Are you telling me you don't have one with you? Run back to Thurgadin at once and speak with Frundle, she can make you one. I will do what I can to stay alive. I may need to move about a bit to keep from being discovered. Hurry now outlander, you're my only hope.<BR><BR>You say, 'hail Frundle Frenkler'<BR><BR>You say, 'what velium vapors'<BR><BR>Frundle Frenkler says 'Ahh, you come seeking my family recipe? After all you've done for our people it's the least I can do. First you must fashion a velium vial, then combine the vial with two small pieces of velium in this jar. That's all there is to it. Please keep the recipe a secret.<BR><BR>You say, 'what velium vial?'<BR><BR>Frundle Frenkler says 'I'm no potter mind you, but if I remember correctly it's a small brick of velium, three crystalline silks, and two glass shards. Then you'll have to finish up by firing it in a kiln with a high quality firing sheet.<BR><BR>Small piece of velium and small block of velium can be looted on Ry’Gorr Minors in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Crystal</st1:place></st1:City> Caverns<BR><BR>Crystalline Silk can be found on spiders in the same zone. So basically, Up to here, it’s rather easy.<BR><BR>1) Combine a small (7 lb) brick of velium, three unstacked crystalline silks and two glass shards in a pottery wheel. You will receive an Unfired Velium Vial.<BR>2) Combine the Unfired Velium Vial and a HQ firing sheet in the kiln and receive a Velium Vial (yes they misspelled it).<BR>3) Combine the Velium Vial and two unstacked small pieces of Velium in the Velium purifier. The Velium Purifier disappears and you are left with a Vial of Velium Vapors. The vial is a lore item and has one charge of gate to Thurgadin.<BR><BR>The vial is trivial at skill 130.<BR><BR>Do not camp the spot where Tanik Greskil is… because i did it, and got A message: You have been ambushed by frost giants! And two Komriff Death Squad will spawn, and try to kill you.<BR><BR>When you get Tanik Greskil to spawn again… just hand him the vial<BR><BR>Tanik Greskil says 'Thank you, Soandso . I shall be eternally grateful to you. Should you ever require my assistance I pledge to you my aid. Please deliver this to Borannin, it is imperative that he deliver this to the Dain at once. Farewell for now outlander...<BR><BR>Then head back to Thurgadin and hand Boradinn the note and your old shawl, for the new shawl.<BR><BR>Loremaster Borannin says 'Words cannot express our gratitude for your deeds outlander, you have saved a hero of our people from certain death. Please accept this, the Fur-lined shawl, as a token of our sincere appreciation. You are indeed among the most highly regarded Humans to set foot in Thurgadin. The next time we meet be sure to ask me how to further advance your reputation with the coldain.<BR><BR>Fur-Lined Coldain Prayer Shawl&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<BR>LORE ITEM MAGIC ITEM NO DROP<BR>AC: +4 Wis: +4 Int: +4 Cold Resist: +4<BR>Weight: 2.0<BR>Classes: All Classes<BR>Races: All Races<BR>Inventory Slot: Shoulder<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<BR><B>Silk Coldain Prayer Shawl</B> <BR><BR>After completing the Saving Tanik Quest, say 'What can I do to further advance my reputation with the coldain?'<BR><BR>Loremaster Borannin says 'Dilani ! Thank Brell you're here. I was about to send one of my Lorekeepers looking for you. It appears that the information Tanik acquired is most perilous indeed. The Dain has called an emergency session of the council and I must attend. We don't have the luxury of waiting for an appropriate task to arise, you must advance as soon as possible. Unfortunately, I have neither the time, nor the components to fashion the next few shawls for you. Ask Rexx Frostweaver about the prayer shawl and follow his direction carefully.<BR><BR>You say, 'Hail Rexx Frostweaver'<BR><BR>Rexx Frostweaver says 'Hmmm, ye be one o them offlanders, don't ye? I've heard some strange tales o yer kind so don't be tryin' any funny business with me. I know the value of a platinum piece and I'll not get cheated by yer foreign coin.<BR><BR>You say, 'I am here for the next prayer shawl.'<BR><BR>Rexx Frostweaver says 'Gather five strands of crystalline silk thread and combine them in a<BR>sewing kit to make a crystalline silk fiber. Take this container and combine a glowing shardworm bile with three of the fibers to form a piece of glowing crystalline silk. Five pieces of glowing crystalline silk sewn to your fur-lined shawl will yield a beautiful silk shawl. Become a master in the art of tailoring before risking all you've worked for and be sure to let me inspect your work when it's complete.<BR><BR>The thread drops from spiders in Velketor's Labrynth and the shardworm bile drops from shardwurms in the Great Divide.<BR><BR>Silk Coldain Prayer Shawl&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<BR>LORE ITEM MAGIC ITEM NO DROP<BR>AC: +5 Wis: +5 Int: +5 Cha: +5 Fire Resist: +5 Cold Resist: +5<BR>Weight: 2.0<BR>Classes: All Classes<BR>Races: All Races<BR>Inventory Slot: Shoulder<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<BR><B>Embroidered Coldain Prayer Shawl</B> <BR><BR>You need 1 Woven Giants Beard, 2 Siren Hairs, 2 Manticore Manes, and 2 Drakel Dire Wolf Whiskers.<BR><BR>First go to Betti Frostreaver and say 'What embroidered prayer shawl' and she will hand you a pattern that is used for the 6th step.<BR><BR>Next go to GD near the Wizard Spires near Eastern Wastes zone and kill the Wolfs that pat around there. Most of the time you'll find someone killing them for faction with the Codian. It's a semi-common drop but is No Drop. While your killing those Wolfs /Auc your buying a Woven Giants Beard. It is Lore so most of the time someone will let you loot one off a giant or will give you one if they sell it to you the common price is about 50 plat for one. I got both whiskers in about 20 mins and the beard during that 20 mins. Also you can sometimes find a beard on a merchant they sell for about 130 plat.<BR><BR>Next zone over to Eastern Wastes this is where a Tracker is helpful. You need to hunt down 2 Manticores and hope they drop there Manes. The Manticore Mane is dropable so you can purchase one if your lucky. Or find a merchant selling one, I had to hunt for mine. Manticores roam the entire zone but are most common near the Great Divide zone area but are still semi-uncommon to find normally only 2-3 are up in the whole zone. Out of the 6 I killed I got 4 manes. Took about an hour to kill 4. BTW these are blue to a level 49. And, was a hard Fight for my Ranger that is really twinked up. Easy if your planning on kiting it since most of the people that are doing this quest are casters.<BR><BR>Lastly, killing Sirens. Head or Gate to Cobalt Scar. There is 2 main areas these are at that I know of behind the Skyshrine ramp down at the waters edge you can see 3 from above + 2 in the water a little bit deeper. And near the <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Sirens</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Grotto</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Cave</st1:PlaceType></st1:place> underwater there is 4 guarding the cave. These are NOT Fun. Bring a group with you if you can. But always remember your friends will turn on you FAST. These things are Enchanters and will Charm your friends and turn them on you as well as nuke you hard. So it makes pulling hard for them.<BR><BR>Now that you've collected everything you need place the beard, 2 manes, 2 whiskers and 2 hairs into the kit. This will make a Thread.

The rune's creation is nearly impossible for even the most skilled of Coldain craftsmen. You should be exceedingly proud. Many have attempted this feat and nearly all have lacked the skill, faith, patience and persistence that is prerequisite for what destiny holds in store for you. You are now ready to use this pattern to construct the sacred rune's casing and complete the runed shawl.<BR><BR>You say, 'what casing'<BR><BR>Talem Tucter says 'Combine two platinum bars, a small piece of velium and the casing pattern in a Jeweler's kit.
