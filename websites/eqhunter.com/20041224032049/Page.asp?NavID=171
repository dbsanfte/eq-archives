Combine two high quality tundra kodiak hides and two high quality snow cougar pelts in a large sewing kit to make the blanket. The item was trivial at skill 82. Turning this in will get you a Copper Coldain Insignia Ring and the following factions: Coldain better, DainFrostreaverIV better, Kromzek worse, Kromrif worse, and some xp.<BR><BR>Copper Coldain Insignia Ring&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<BR>LORE ITEM MAGIC ITEM NO DROP<BR>AC: +1 Str: +1 Magic Resist: +1<BR>Weight: 0.1<BR>Classes: All Classes<BR>Races: All Races<BR>Inventory Slot: Finger<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<BR><B>Silver Coldain Insignia Ring</B> <BR><BR>You must first do the Garadain's Blanket quest to get your copper ring. After that, Garadain asks you to take the axe he gives you to his nephew Boridain, and bring back proof that he is ok, along with your Copper ring. This requires going to coordinates -2446, 1544 and giving Boridain the Axe. At this point, he will start trying to find his Rabid Kodiak. Which means he wanders around and gets in trouble. You must keep him from dying. I highly suggest a minimum of two people for this, so one can fight and the other can keep following Boridain. Some of the mobs we had to fight were blue to a 52, btw. Eventually, a Rabid Kodiak will spawn. Kill it, loot the rabid pelt, and give to Boridain. You don't have much time, as he will despawn in a minute or two after the kodiak is dead. He will give you back a Broken Axe. Take this Broken Axe (this is your "proof" for Garadain) and your Copper ring back to Garadain to recieve a Silver ring. There was xp but no faction for completing this quest.<BR><BR>Silver Coldain Insignia Ring&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<BR>LORE ITEM MAGIC ITEM NO DROP<BR>AC: +2 Str: +2 Magic Resist: +2<BR>Weight: 0.0<BR>Classes: All Classes<BR>Races: All Races<BR>Inventory Slot: Finger<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<BR><B>Gold Coldain Insignia Ring</B> <BR><BR>This is the third quest in the Garadain series. This time, he wants you to make him a nice knife. You need a flawless walrus hide, a wooly rhino tusk, and a skinning rock. The walrus hide is actually a high quality walrus hide, and the tusk is a horn. These can be found on the appropriate mobs. The hard part is the skinning rock, which spawns randomly on the ground. Once you have all three items, combine them in a forge to make Garadain's new knife. (Trivial at 65) Once you have the knife made, take it and your Silver ring back to Garadain for the gold ring. He then gives you the quest for the platinum ring, the details of which are still unclear. This is the third quest in the Garadain series. This time, he wants you to make him a nice knife.

He wants you to get him a hammer to smith the knife you just got for him. He gives you a note to give to Tain Frostbite, however, you really want to give it to Tain Hammerfrost.<BR><BR>If you head straight out from the dragon bone bridge in the eastern wastes...you will very soon (after the first hill) come to a small dwarven cleric named Tain. <BR>Giving him the note does not do much, but if you hail him, he'll mention that he was ambushed by frost giants and he desperately needs [help]. <BR>If you say "I will help you" he sits down (I think he actually despawns and respawns immediately, which may be important) and says "they will be here soon! Kill Grhek and give me his vial".<BR><BR>4 Frost giants, and one named giant....spawn not too far and run up to kill the dwarf. They are all blue to a 56 <BR>If you can kill the named Giant, you can loot a blue vial ALL/ALL no stats. (it had a name..for the life of me I don't recall it...). Tradeable.<BR><BR>If the dwarf despawns and respawns before you can give him the vial, you get nothing. If you give the vial to him before he despawns (or perhaps after triggering him again) he gives you a Coldain Smithing Hammer, a no drop lore item with no stats. Take that back to Garadain along with your gold ring and he will give you the platinum ring.<BR><BR>Platinum Coldain Insignia Ring&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<BR>LORE ITEM MAGIC ITEM NO DROP<BR>AC: +4 Str: +4 Magic Resist: +4<BR>Weight: 1.0<BR>Classes: All Classes<BR>Races: All Races<BR>Inventory Slot: Finger<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /><o:p></o:p></FONT></SPAN></P>

Garadain asks you to go intercept a rygorr messenger who is carrying invasion plans. Garadain instructs you to give the invasion plans to a coldain lookout in his camp. He also tells you to intercept the invasion force and kill the leader, an orc named Scarbrow. When you give the lookout the plans, a veritable horde of orcs attacks Garadain's outpost. Scarbrow leads a force of 2-3 rygorr invaders (lvl 42-44) and 2-3 rygorr oracles. (lvl 42-44)<BR><BR>Without your assistance the orcs will probably wipe out the dwarves, however this isn't good because the dwarves can out damage you, and thus cause Scarbrow's corpse to poof when you do finally kill him.<BR><BR>The trick is this: The orcs spawn about 100 yards from the camp. You must intercept Scarbrow before the dwarves agro. You can let the dwarves kill the other invaders, and I highly suggest it, because 7 43+ mobs are a pain. Scarbrow himself is about 47th level and is a shadow knight. Anyway, get Scarbrow away from the action and kill him there while one person kites the other orcs. There is some risk here in that the oracles may sow themselves and they can do some real damage with spells if you try to kite them. But doing it this way only required 3 people, whereas killing all 7 toe-to-toe would probably require 2 groups, even if you had an enchanter.<BR><BR>Scarbrow drops his head and a Frozen Orb, a very nice range slot item. Giving his head and your platinum ring to Garadain results in the Obsidian Coldain Insignia Ring.<BR><BR>Obsidian Coldain Insignia Ring&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<BR>LORE ITEM MAGIC ITEM NO DROP<BR>AC: +5 Str: +5 Magic Resist: +5<BR>Weight: 0.1<BR>Classes: All Classes<BR>Races: All Races<BR>Inventory Slot: Finger<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<BR><B>Mithril Coldain Insignia Ring</B> <BR><BR>This is the sixth Coldain quest. Garadain wants you to find out what happened to the coldain invasion force that tried to attack the giants a while back. No evidence has ever been found of their demise. Garadain wants 2 things, proof of their demise, and proof of the demise of their killers.<BR><BR>For the proof of the demise of the Coldain, Korrigan the undead coldain is the NPC you want to talk to. He spawns at night at the dwarven hut near Icefang, the named dire wolf. Talking to the undead coldain reveals that the coldain elite forces were the victims of a very nasty trick by the rygorr. Before the coldain could mount their attack on the giants, Rygorr shaman charmed the coldain's wolves and turned them on their masters. During the conversation with Korrigan, Icefang respawns as an agro high level version of himself and attacks you.<BR><BR>Stay out of range of Icefang, and he will eventually run over to the orc hut near the bridge. When he gets there, 4 oracles or ry'gorr will spawn along with Poxbreath Yellowfang, a named rygorr. Kill Yellowfang to get a Note from Kromrif. (no drop) The note outlines Rodrick the coldain traitor's assistance in killing the elite coldain.<BR><BR>Near Rygorr keep is the exit of crystal caverns. Every once in a while a Rygorr Emissary will spawn there. If you wait a few minutes and don't kill him, Rodrick will spawn next to him. He is a traitor to the coldain. Kill him to get his Head (no drop).<BR><BR>Turn the head, the note and your obsidian ring in to Garadain Glacierbane for your mithril insignia ring.<BR><BR>Mithril Coldain Insignia Ring&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<BR>LORE ITEM MAGIC ITEM NO DROP<BR>AC: +6 Str: +6 Magic Resist: +6<BR>Weight: 0.1<BR>Classes: All Classes<BR>Races: All Races<BR>Inventory Slot: Finger<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<BR><B>Adamantium Coldain Insignia Ring</B> <BR><BR>Garadain asks you to rescue Corbin Blackwell. Kill Warden Bruke for his Shackle Key (no drop) and then give both the key and your mithril insignia ring to Corbin Blackwell. He will make his escape. (And give back the ring). You must protect Corbin until he reaches Dobbin Crossaxe.<BR><BR>Along the way 4 rygorr and 4 giants including Commander Bahreck, a named giant, will attack Corbin. You must keep him alive. Once he reaches Dobbin, Dobbin will thank you for rescuing him and tell you that he will give you a note for Garadain if you show him your mithril insignia ring.<BR><BR>Giving Dobbin the ring results in a note. Give this note back to Garadain and he will reward you with the adamantium ring.<BR><BR>Adamantium Coldain Insignia Ring&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<BR>LORE ITEM MAGIC ITEM NO DROP<BR>AC: +7 Str: +7 Magic Resist: +7<BR>Weight: 1.0<BR>Classes: All Classes<BR>Races: All Races<BR>Inventory Slot: Finger<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<BR><B>Velium Coldain Insignia Ring</B> <BR><BR>This is the 8th Garadain quest. It is an all out war against Chief Ry'Gorr and his troops.<BR><BR>Garadain says 'Very Well, Kaladur , give me the Adamantite ring and I will give you the marching orders. Once the orders are given to Gloradin in the next hut, we will be underway. You then must follow me to what will be our battleground. I must warn you, I will hold your ring until the head of Chief Ry'Gorr is given to me. If we fail, all will<BR>be lost... for both of us.<BR><BR>As you can see, the 8th quest is tough. You only get ONE chance to do it right. Once you give Garadain your ring, you must kill Chief Ry'Gorr, loot his head, and give the head to Garadain. Ry'gorr only has a head during this event. I am unsure if you can do the quest if Garadain dies. Most likely, if he dies during this event you won't be able to complete the quest. You only get one shot at this, because you lose the ring.<BR><BR>This battle involves 30+ rygorr, including some low 50's. This probably requires a well-tuned team of 55-60th level snare kiters, or alternatively a full 30+ PC army.<BR><BR>Velium Coldain Insignia Ring&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<BR>LORE ITEM MAGIC ITEM NO DROP<BR>AC: +8 Str: +8 Magic Resist: +8<BR>Weight: 1.0<BR>Classes: All Classes<BR>Races: All Races Inventory Slot: Finger<BR><BR>Effect: Shield of the Eighth (8pt DS)<BR>Type: Triggered<BR>Charges: Unlimited<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<BR><B>Coldain Hero’s Insignia Ring</B> <BR><BR>Hand Seneschal Aldikar the 8th Coldain Ring (Velium Coldain Insigna Ring) after a short dialogue he will say 'Will you accept this task outlander?<BR><BR>You say, 'I will accept the task'<BR><BR>He will hand you a 6 Slot container and ask you to put Rodrick's Dagger and the heads of the Traitors.<BR><BR>We need 6 items<BR><BR>1) Rodrick's Dagger (Eastern Wastes)<BR>2) Murdrick's Head (Great Divide)<BR>3) Barradain's Head (Eastern Wastes)<BR>4) Peffin's Head (Eastern Wastes)<BR>5) Doldigun's Head (Kael)<BR>6) Juliah's Head (Icewell Keep)<BR><BR>1) Dagger.

Pass up his room, there is another room deeper in on the right. Set up camp there. Harmony the room. Have a lvl 60 pull him from max range and pull in to the group, he will not depop in there. If you have any adds have someone aggro them and pull them out of the cave. Make sure Davin Fatfist returns to his spawn spot or Murdrick will not spawn.

Trivial confirmed at 248.<BR><BR>4) Peffin's Head. Hand Note to Peffin, in Giant fort, in EW, She is invisable. She will respawn and run out, she is very glitchy you may not see her, just don’t attack until she respawns a second time in front of the fire. 3 Giants spawn inside the hut, they see invis, are 51+, harmony, CoH, or gate to get out. Peffin will be standing right in front of the fire at the bottom of the hill. She has 5 Giant guards 51+ and all are rooted, you can no longer pull her or her guards. Kill Peffin and loot her head and a note to Doldigun.<BR><BR>5) Doldigun's Head at Loc neg 850, pos 1150. Doldigun can be found in Kael. He can be spawned by saying "the Dain shall be slain for the peace we must obtain" Hand him the note and he hands you a Juliah Lockhearts Ring.<BR><BR>If you attack him he runs and 2 guards show up. Several Giants will spawn, I think at most 2 at a time. Keep killing these giants until Doldigun respawns. Once he does kill him and loot the head.<BR><BR>*** He does not seem to spawn if the giants are up **<BR><BR>6) Juliah's Head. Hand Juliah her ring. She will respawn and hits for 350's the other Dwarfs do not aggro. Kill her and loot head, she also has a chance of dropping a necklace, and spells.
