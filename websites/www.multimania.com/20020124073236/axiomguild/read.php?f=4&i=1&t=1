Date:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11-03-01 19:54<br>
<br>This quest is for all paladins (only), starting around lvl 30 or 35. <br>
<br>
Be warned that this quest (in fact, one quest for each part of the armor) is VERY long, difficult and involved. But any true paladin will want this symbol of faith and power that only a holy knight could wear !<br>
<br>
1. The armor :<br>
<br>
Ro armor pieces are described below :<br>
<br>
Helm of Ro : AC 13, +8 WIS<br>
Boots of Ro : AC 11, +35 HP<br>
Vambraces of Ro : AC 11, +6 WIS, +10 SvDis<br>
Greaves of Ro : AC 13, +6 STA, +10 SvCold<br>
Bracers of Ro : AC 9, +5 SvMg<br>
BreastPlate of Ro : AC 20, +4 STR, +10 SvFire<br>
Gauntlets of Ro : AC 12, +6 DEX, +10 SvPois<br>
<br>
Note that AC is slightly better than standard Fine Plate armor, and that all pieces are not NoDrop, so you can sell or buy them (but it's far more fun to do the whole quest by yourself !).<br>
<br>
2. The overall quest process :<br>
<br>
For EACH part of the Ro armor, you will need to repeat this process :<br>
<br>
- Create a bar of Ronium from various components (this part is the same for all pieces, and must be done EACH time)<br>
- Get the mold for the piece you want to make (different quest for each part)<br>
- Combine the Ronium and the mold in a forge (you don't need a blacksmithing skill), and Voila! you get the Ro piece...<br>
<br>
3. How to get a bar of Ronium :<br>
<br>
This is a very long and difficult task, and it must be repeated once for EACH armor part. So it's better to find several of each components needed when you can.<br>
<br>
To make the Ronium bar, you need to combine into a Cauldron of Ro :<br>
- one Sands of Ro<br>
- one Melatite<br>
- two bars of Enchanted Platinum<br>
- one Soil of Underfoot<br>
- one Mistmoore Granite<br>
<br>
To get the Cauldron of Ro, go into the Temple of Solusek Ro in Lavastorm (entry beyond the great lake of lava, on other side if you look from entrances of Solusek A and B). This is a pure NPC zone with no aggressive mobs, unless you have very bad faction with good people (which would be quite strange for a paladin). In the temple, search for a dwarf named Lord Searfire. Consider him. You need to be at least amiable to him (faction : Temple of Solusek Ro). If not, you need to build faction by :<br>
<br>
- killing shadowed men (in West Commons, South Karana, Lesser Faydark, ...) : very long<br>
- give 30 gp (maybe 3pp works also) at a time to Rathmana Allin, Erudite NPC located in a small camp in NW <br>
<br>
corner of South Ro zone<br>
- give 4 dervishes rings at a time to Ortallius, a friendly orc NPC located in the same camp as Rathmana Allin.<br>
- go into Mistmoore Graveyard, take the flower on the coffin in the small building (beware traps on the side), exit the building and give the flower to the friendly Shadowed man Ssynthi behind the building.<br>
<br>
I have build my faction by giving dervishes rings to Ortallius. <br>
<br>
When your faction is high enough, return to Lord Searfire and ask 'What strange alloy ?'. He will give you a Cauldron of Ro. Keep it in a safe place.<br>
<br>
How to gather all needed components for Ronium :<br>
<br>
4. Sands of Ro :<br>
<br>
This is an uncommon drop from Sands Giants in Deserts of Ro and Oasis. Just kill Sands giants with a good group, or auction for them in these zones or at tunnel. Sands of Ro is not No Drop, and can be bought for 10 to 20pp. <br>
<br>
5. Melatite :<br>
<br>
This is a rare drop from Gnomes bots in the small mining camp of Solusek A (near Fire goblins). You must kill  CWG Models MB and MC. Each can drop one Melatite as rare drop. Beware that these guys are around lvl 35, that live gnomes will help them, and that killing them will drop your faction with steamfont gnomes. If you don't want to kill them, you need to auction for Melatite in Solusek, in Lavastorm or in tunnel, but it's a difficult stuff to get. I bought some for 20 to 50pp each.<br>
<br>
6. Enchanted Platinum :<br>
<br>
Easiest part, but costly : buy 2 bars of platinums in a jeweller shop (Kaladim, Freeport, Qeynos, ...). Each goes for 110 to 140pp depending on your charisma. Then find an enchanter level 34 or above to enchant your platinum. This is a sample spell of level 34, without any component needed. Give a small donation to the caster for his work.<br>
<br>
7. Soil of Underfoot :<br>
<br>
This is a combined item from 4 Fairy dusts. To get dust, just kill fairies in Greater Faydark (simple but quite rare), or in Lesser Faydark : There is a small Fairy village at West side of Lesser Faydark zone. Just go to Mistmoore zone (without entering MM zone), then follow again the South wall towards WEST, turn at SW corner, follow the West wall to the North for some time, looking carefully to not miss the Fairies village (or you will run directly into the brownies camp). Loc must be +1200, -3800. Just kill fairies (beware of multiples aggros), dust is an uncommon drop. When you get 4 dusts, turn them to Priestess Ghalea in Cleric Guild of North Kaladim. She will give you a Soil of Underfoot. You must have Kindly faction with Clerics of underfoot to be given the Soil. If your faction is not high enough (even me, Ainurdolin MithrilForge, dwarf Paladin of Brell Serilis, had to build my faction !), build it by turning Bone Chips to Gunlok Jure in the paladin guild of Kaladim (large building behind cleric guild). <br>
<br>
8. Mistmoore granite :<br>
<br>
This is an uncommon drop from some gargoyles inside Mistmoore. It's NoDrop, you will have to go there yourself (I know, it's a deadly place, must be the zone where I died the most).<br>
You need to hunt gargoyles INSIDE the castle. The gargoyles near tower at bottom of ramp, or inside pit near entrance of castle DOES NOT drop the granite. Best place to go is at 2nd floor, by the graveyard and jails. <br>
<br>
Second room after the jails is home of 2 gargoyles. Else everywhere in the castle you will find many gargoyles.<br>
<br>
9. Creating the ronium :<br>
<br>
You just need to put into the Cauldron of Ro : 1 sands of Ro, 1 melatite, 2 enchanted platinum bars (in 2 different slots, not stacked), 1 soil of underfoot, 1 mistmoore granite. Press COMBINE, you got one bar of Ronium. Remember... You need oe such bar for EACH Ro armor part.<br>
<br>
Note that you can buy or sell Ronium bars for more than 1000 pp. But very few players will buy or sell this...<br>
<br>
10. getting the molds :<br>
<br>
Remember, you need a specific mold for each Ro armor part, to combine one ronium bar and one mold into a forge.<br>
<br>
You need to go to Rathe Mountains, at a nice Paladin camp located around (+3000, -800). Each NPC here will speak about a specific Ro armor part when hailed. Just answer with the Ro part that was inside brackets, and if you have good enough faction with the specific paladin guild, the NPC will give you info about the quest to get the mold. If not, you will need to build faction with this paladin guild before going further.<br>
<br>
Also, an interesting thing to note : giving the items to the NPC for getting one mold gives also great xp ! I gained nearly 2 blue bubbles at lvl 39, for each mold I got.<br>
<br>
11 : Mold for Helm<br>
I don't know which faction is needed (mine was good enough at start of quest). You need to loot 2 undead cyclop skulls. These undead cyclops are semi-rare spawns in South Karana (best to use ranger or druid to track them, else use Sense Undead spell)à and around lvl 35. Pretty easy to solo above 35 with Dismiss Undead spells, a ghoulbane and maybe a LoH ready... These skulls are NOT NoDrop, you can buy them (try to auction in South Karana). Turn the 2 skulls to the NPC in paladin camp of Rathe to get the Mold for Helm of Ro.<br>
<br>
12 : Mold for Boots <br>
Kill a rare spawn in South Ro named Sand Giant Hussam. He's pretty feeble, even if he looks like a normal Sand Giiant. His common drop is Kilij Plans. Just turn the plans in Rathe Mountains to get the mold for the boots of Ro.<br>
<br>
13 : Mold for Vambraces<br>
You need good faction with the Temple of Life in Qeynos. If needed, go to Qeynos and turn 2gp at a time to Lashun Novashine in front of the temple of Life (in North Qeynos). If not here, wait a few minutes, he will come back. This will take FOREVER ! Another method, when your faction is at least indifferent (will not work before) : have another player creates a mule character in Qeynos (warrior), and enter the pool under the Temple of Life. Hunt the Koalind fishes here and kill them (with buffs, quite easy even for a lvl 1). The uncommon drop of the fish is Koalind scales. Let your paladin loot the fish, and gives the scales to the NPC knight turning around the pool. You will gain better faction very quickly. Why do you need to use a mule character ? Because killing the fish first LOWER greatly most Qeynos faction, included Temple of Life. <br>
<br>
When your faction is high enough, all is not done : you need to find 2 rotten shark meats from plague sharks in Erud's crossing. Just take the boat from Qeynos to Odus, zone, then jump in the water and search UNDER the boat. You can also use a druid or ranger to track the plague sharks for you. The meat is uncommon drop, so you will need several attemps to get 2 meats. Also, beware of killer sharks wandering around, that are far higher level... Rotten meat is NOT NoDrop, but I really don't see why players whill have one and sell it...<br>
<br>
14 : Mold for Greaves<br>
You need one head of NightFall Giant. This giant is a rare spawn in West Commonlands. Difficult to find, as the sheer number of players in this zone make difficult for such a giant to survive for long. Good thing however, the head is NOT NoDrop, so you can try to auction for one...<br>
<br>
15 : Mold for Bracers<br>
You need to find 2 Nets from goblins Net Masters in Lake RatheTear. Those gobs are semi-rare spawns, they wander in water, and are most often grouped with a skeleton pet. They are soloable around lvl 40, but they are casters, so be careful. The net seems to be the common drop.<br>
<br>
16 : Mold for BreastPlate<br>
<br>
This is the masterpiece, but probably the most difficult mold to get... You need 2 Dark Cauldrons, looted from Ancille Cooks in Castle Mistmoore. The cooks spawn in the kitchen (2 spawns at once in the room) and have a quite long spawn rate... The Cauldron is an uncommon drop, so a single spawn will probably not be enough... Be careful, the cooks have Harm Touch (get clerics or LoH ready). And you will need a full group around lvl 40 to get there safely, with at least a cleric and/or an enchanter. The kitchen is deep inside MistMoore...<br>
<br>
17 : Mold for Gauntlets<br>
This one is quite easy. You need 1 Locket looted from Sentry Alchin in South Karana. Sentry Alchin is a knight who changes to a werewolf at night. It's better to kill him in werewolf form, as I heard that it will not give you bad faction. I was unable to find him in werewolf however, so I killed him in human form and lose some faction with Qeynos guards (not too much however). You can solo him around lvl 40. The Locket is the common drop, and is NoDrop.<br>
<br>
18 : Combine : <br>
<br>
Just go to a standard forge (not cultural). Click on it to open the combine box (box must be named Forge, not any specific racial name). Put into it one mold, and one bar of Ronium. Combine (you do not need any smithing skill. Maybe put 1 training point in smithing, just to be safe). You get one Ro armor part. Grats !!!<br>
<br>
<br>
I already have done some of these quests :<br>
- Gauntlets, Helm, Breastplate and Greaves. I still need Vambraces and Bracers, and don't want boots (Dwarven Work Boots and Journeyman Boots are way better ;-D)<br>
<br>
I will happily help any paladin of the guild (Grimscyth ? Skotos ?) in these quests, and will try to give more details if needed.<br>
