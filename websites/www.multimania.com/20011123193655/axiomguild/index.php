<h2><a name="071101B"></a>Raid : Castle MistMoore</h2>
<p>We plan to have a new raid into Castle Mistmoore on November, Sunday 11th . 
  All characters level 30 and up could join. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Starting time should be 11 AM Central (12 AM East, 6 PM CET, 
  10 AM MST, 9 AM PDT, 1 AM JAP).</b></p>
<p>Mistmoore is a great place to go for several quest items. I think most paladins 
  from the guild will like to loot Mistmoore Granite and Dark Cauldrons for Ro 
  armor quests, and Hilt of Soulfire for Soulfire quest. Several other classes 
  could need stuff (Mistmoore battle drums, Essence of Moonlinght, etc...). </p>
<p>Try to be there before starting hour to avoid delays for grouping and get organized.</p>
<h2><a name="111101A"></a>Debriefing after Cazic Thule raid</h2>
<p>8 members from level 25 to level 42 joined on Saturday to raid the Lost Temple 
  of Cazic Thule. </p>
<p>Two groups, based on levels, were formed, and stayed together to explore the 
  dungeon. First fights inside Courtyard, then in the maze, then around and on 
  large Archon pyramid were ok, and we proceeded inside the Archon pyramid. This 
  strange place was quite confusing, and after a few looks inside, one member 
  fell into the water at the base of pyramid. With no mean for this poor fellow 
  to exit by the way we all came, we all jumped into water to search for another 
  exit (map told us that a complex sewer system was available below). </p>
<p>The water was populated by many crocs, and soon, with the difficulties of fighting 
  into water, and the scattering of members jumping from the top of the pyramid, 
  2 members died. Other swimmed inside the sewers, but get confused by the intricate 
  maze of cubical rooms and tunnels flooded with water, and 2 others friends soon 
  were lying on the ground of the next cavern near the sewers. Remaining members 
  then fought repeatedly the mobs around (crocs, lizard men) while draging corpses 
  to this area.</p>
<p>It took us almost one hour to drag all corpses, fight some mobs, use invis 
  to gather and drag all bodies to the zone. Some choose to leave at this time, 
  some grouped again to hunt into Throne Room for some time.</p>
<p>Several lessons could be learned from this :</p>
<ul>
  <li>Death is always a possibility and is part of the game. Everyone should accept 
    it.</li>
  <li>Fighting inside an unknown place is far more dangerous than in a well known 
    area, even if each mob is not too dangerous.</li>
  <li>Fighting as a whole group is KEY to victory : single puller, no scattering, 
    all tanks focused on same mob, will accelerate the fights and reduce the risks.</li>
  <li>Quite all group members (me included) made some mistakes during this event. 
    We should learn from this :-D</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="101101A"></a>RAID : Lost Temple of Cazic Thule</h2>
<p>We plan to have a raid into the Lost Temple of Cazic Thule on November, Saturday 
  10th . All characters level 20 to 35 could join. Members above that could help 
  for crow control, pulling and spawn breaks, without grouping.</p>
<p align="center"><b>Starting time should be 2 PM Central (3 PM East, 9 PM CET, 
  1 PM MST, Noon PST)</b></p>
<p>Lost Temple of Cazic Thule is an underutilized dungeon with lot of Lizard Men. 
  Several mobs drops very good loot for rogues and for SK. Nice xp til lvl 35, 
  but this dungeon is famous for the deadly trains all the way to the entrance, 
  so we'll need to pull carefully and fight as a very united group. We should 
  be able to discover and camp most if not whole dungeon.</p>
<p>To go to Temple of Cazic Thule, bind at Freeport (good races), then head to 
  NRo, Oasis, SRo, Innothule (hug the RIGHT wall til zone), then the Feerott. 
  Temple zone is at middle of South wall of Feerott zone, on a long island on 
  south part of river splitting the Feerott zone in two. Another path could be 
  South Karana, Lake Rathetear, Rathe Mountains then Feerott. Binding is also 
  possible at the Arena near Lake Rathetear. Evil races could bind in Ogguk, North 
  of Feerott.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some good maps of Temple of Cazic Thule could be find at <a href="http://www.eqatlas.com/cazicthule.html" target="_blank">eqatlas</a> 
  and <a href="http://www.eqmaps.com/m2/cazicthule5.jpg" target="_blank">eqmaps</a>.</p>
<p>As always, try to be near Temple before starting hour. We could not afford 
  to wait one hour more for all to be there. </p>

<h2><a name="291001A"></a>Raid in ToFS aftermath</h2>
<p>The raid in ToFS is done. Valiant members were there in two groups, one for 
  lower levels (under 40 : Leaddil, Canelle, Zilore), and one for higher levels 
  (above 40 : Iegien, Nunnen, Fardain, Skotos, Grimscyth, Ainurdolin). </p>
<p>After a trip to the tower (by boat from north Desert of Ro for some, and by 
  Nunnen Airlines port for others), we all entered the 1st floor and began to 
  hack and slash the various undead found there. Each level is locked by a key 
  that must be found on the lower below. Key to 2nd floor is kept by a Large Undead 
  Gnoll that spawns after enough undead are killed. We got the key after nearly 
  45 mns of ininterrupted fight, and proceeded to the 2nd floor. </p>
<p>This floor is a large library filled by ghostly students, scholars and teachers. 
  An Angry Librarian should randomly spawn after kills, and drop the key to 3rd 
  level. Unfortunately, we never managed to found him, and we were only second 
  after a group already seeking the key. So after more than 1 hour of killing 
  (good xp for lower group), we choosed to leave and call it a day. We did suffer 
  a loss during the fight : Nunnen, wandering alone in a dark corner of the library 
  as most halflings do, was burned to death by an undad caster without notice 
  from anyone. He managed to recover his corpse quite easily (after a run from 
  bind point in Oasis) but losed the xp (no cleric available near, and floor difficult 
  to reach anyway).</p>
<p>We were all ported back to RiverVale by Nunnen to share loot (some magic items 
  : gnome skin armor mostly, and pp). We now have the key to 2nd level (ryonea 
  has already ALL keys) and could try again soon to gain the key to 3rd level, 
  where better loot and xp still avaits us...</p>

<h2><a name="261001A"></a>RAID IN TOWER of FROZEN SHADOW</h2>
<p>The raid into Tower of Frozen Shadow (ToFS) is today, Sunday 28th. All characters 
  level 30 and up could join. Please look the great posts of <a href="profile.php?id=21">Ryonea</a> 
  posted <a href="read.php?f=2&i=3&t=2">here</a>.</p>
<p align="center"><b>Starting time is 10 AM Central (11 AM East, 5 PM CET, 9 AM 
  MST, 8 AM PDT, midnight JAP).</b></p>
<p>Tower of Frozen Shadow is located on Velious (you should have the extension), 
  in Iceclad zone. To get there, either take the raft departing from North Ro, 
  to small island, to IceBreaker boat, then walk from island to island until you 
  see the tower. Or use a wizard or druid port to nearby island (short walk and 
  swim). Try to be there before starting hour to avoid delays for grouping and 
  get organized. REMEMBER ALSO THAT DAYLIGHT SAVING TIME SHIFT IS ON SINCE TODAY 
  IN MOST COUNTRIES, don't get wrong.</p>
<p>Have a look at ToFS maps (maybe download and print them if you plan to join) 
  :</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.eqmaps.com/m2/tower_level4.jpg" target="_blank">Map 
    of 4th floor</a>.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.everlore.com/ShowScreenShot.asp?id=389769" target="_blank">Map 
    of 7th floor</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Seems quite difficult to find maps of ToFS, that's all I have.</p>

<h2><a name="290901A"></a>Forums section still in ' Work in progress' status</h2>
<p>I am adding a section with Forums/Bulletin Boards functions 
  for guild members. This section IS NOT working yet. You can use it (try if you 
  want, will allow me to test some more), but your registration and messages posted 
  could be erased at any time (think of it as a 'test server' like in EQ)..</p>
