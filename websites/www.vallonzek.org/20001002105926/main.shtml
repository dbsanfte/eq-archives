If you're anything like I am, and playing on the Race War servers, you're
tired of these makeshift alliances with rival teams that suddenly break
down in a matter of minutes.  I think the problem is that Verant has failed
to provide a story line behind the Racewar server, and simply just let it
run on it's own.  Well, here is <A HREF="http://www.tallonzek.org/articles/rw_history.shtml">a story</A>
that I am making up on the fly, but
that can be used to help set the stage for the RW Servers.

	We had some server configuration problems that just got ironed out.  So now, VZ players have their

	(TZ will get this too).  Now send in those events so I have something to post!  Our numbers are
	dwindling, but racewar isn't dead yet, just in line with a "normal" pvp server.  The VZ guild

	to the server.  I will create a common (shared between TZ and VZ) message board soon.

New Servers 8/2/99 5:45 pm
<P>
We recently brought up the new Tallon and Vallon Zek servers. There is no guarantee if the new servers
exceed capacity that we will keep them on-line. We are going to gauge the player load tonight, and if need
be, bring up a third server, possibly as early as tomorrow afternoon. 
<P>
As we mentioned in last week's patch message, the Vallon and Tallon Zek (PvP-teams) servers are in a
*beta* stage of game development. By this, we mean, due to game-related properties, unique only to the
PvP-Teams servers, we reserve the right to make any changes to game play, sweeping if need be.

I logged on today to find that one of my biggest gripes had been fixed. My Prayers answered. My Pet
actually defended me in a PVP battle against a player higher in level than myself. Before this, pets had the
same +/- 4 level restriction as Players did, making the levels just before a new spell teir VERY difficult to
defend against PVP attackers. My poor level 22 pet just would not help me if a lvl 27+ person attacked
me. Well, this has all been changed and confirmed by a GM. <BR><BR>

 <font size=+1><b>Two Servers to Open</b></font><P>
While Verant may have wildly underestimated the number of people playing on Tallon Zek, they are trying to make ammends
by launching two servers.  Verant "hopes" to have these servers(named Vallon Zek and of course Tallon Zek) up by Wednesday.  I think this will take an act of God, but 
I can hope and pray like anyone else.  I would also like to take a second to share my experiences with some of you from the race war
server.  Firstly, I started off playing a Dark Elf.  This turned out to be a horror as immediately upon logging in, there were over 200
players sitting in the Commons and a friend sitting next to me telling me that there are about 300 in the 3rd quarter(WOW).  It took me 
45 seconds after actually handing my guildmaster the note before it had registered with him.  Now, I am on a multi-t1 line.  This was 
unbearable, I can only imagine how horrible it was for those on Modems.  Ok, so finally I begin to go outside to get my first kill(Laugh).
My first experience on walking outside was that there was 3 skeletons someone had trained to the front entrance and were slaying people
as they zoned out.  The gaurds you say?  Well, there was so much server lag, the guards were so lagged out, they were spinning in little 
circles and probably laughing at all the newbies being mercilessly slaughtered.  Well, after 30 full minutes of not finding anything to 
kill, we headed over to the ecommons to find the conditions there no better.  At this point I said forget about it, logged out and continued
to play my other characters.  Thirty minutes later, <serverwide message> Aradune - Tallon Zek will be coming down.  I can only imagine the 
cries of chaos and shouts of horror across the newbie lands of Norrath.  However I DO think that Verant made a good move by doing this.  
That is hardly anyway for someone to play that game and certainly not the game that Verant had in mind.  I do disagree with Verant not 
opening two servers in the beginning.  There was more then enough hype to warrant 2 or even 3 servers.  I think we will all see more of the
same come this wednesday.  5000 may have been an immature number due to the number of people that couldnt get in or had already left. I still
forecast from 3000 to 4000 per server on both Vallon Zek and Tallon Zek.  This will probably be no better and I would think it best for 
Verant to have at least 1 other server ready to go for such conditions. But alas, I dont think this is going to happen.  Basically, I am telling
you to prepare for more of the same this coming wednesday.

		Well, folks, we totally underestimated the number of people wanting to check out the PvP-Teams
      server and the demand is far too great for one server. Unfortunately, we were forced to bring
      Tallon Zek down soon after its launch because we had more than 5,000 people online at once.
      While the servers were still running, there was lag and the areas were simply too crowded - you
      players deserve a better environment than that. As a result, Tallon Zek will remain down until we
      can get an additional server (which will take at MINIMUM one week). I apologize for the
      inconvenience, and I'm sure many of you are frustrated by this. In the end, though, it's better to
      wait for more resources than to leave Tallon Zek up.

Humans will satrt in it. There will be "Strong" faction hits on the RW
server but they are removing them from RZ and the regular servers. So people
who kill allot of elves  better not stray to close to a elven guard. As it
stands now, Looting will be same as RZ for now, though they may change it.
It is really still up in ther air. As for the release date... "soon" is the
official word and the unofficial word is at best, monday probably tuesday
unless some other problems arise on the Test Server. Right now they are
fixing the problem that people who kill half elves get a faction hit
against the humans. So they gotta get rid of those problems first he said,
and then they will bring Tallon Zek live. So hopefully if things go well,
the server will be up by Tuesday.<BR><BR>

 <font size=+1><b>Rallos Zek PvP Petition</b></font><P>
   Although some would argue after reading the message board that the primary faction in
   the race war aren't going to be Shorties vs Evil, but instead "red" vs "blue" players,
   it is important to remember that we are a PvP server, and that problems on Rallos Zek
   will affect us as well.  RallosZek.com has a petition itemizing several of the problems
   as they stand in PvP play, and it will help us all to be aware of and to let Verant
   know that players on both servers wish a resolution.  You can find the 
	<A HREF="http://www.sitepowerup.com/mb/view.asp?Action=Reply&BoardID=108183&Reply=3">
	petition here.

     If all goes well, we will be adding 2 new servers next week. 1 will
     be the PvP (Team) server and the other will be a normal server.

     Firstly, got word that illussion does funny things to your names when doing a /who.  If you are
     in a zone and just do a /who or a /who 10 or the the like it will show your Illussioned race, or
     list you as unknown.  However if you do a /who Baelish for example it will show I really am a
     Dark Elf.  Not sure if this is a bug or not.  But for now its a good way for our cover to be blown
     in enemy territory.
     <P>
     Secondly, I personally was a bit concerned that with Tallos Zek coming soon that Enchanters
     would begin to be perceived as 'over powered' with our illussion capabilities.  I was sort of
     worried that players on non pvp servers would suffer because of a real power which the class
     had on a pvp server.  Especially considering only 2 out of all the servers are pure pvp.  To cut a
     long story short: I spoke with GZ and asked him about this and he said it had been considered
     already and no changes would be made or were being planned at this time in relation to this.

 First, I’d like to thank all of you who’ve been helping out on the Test Server – the testing of the PvP Teams code is coming
 along quite nicely. We’re probably looking at about another two weeks or so of the test server being configured that way, after
 which we will bring Tallon Zek online.

 <font size=+1><b>Race war bugs</b></font>
 Iuons is testing the race war code on the test server.  Here's the results so far:</tr></td>
 <tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>
 <font color=EE5500> 
   Well, I've been busy lately testing the race war code (someone has to do it). I've heard a
   few bugs that I'm trying to get around to testing. Right now, there is four big ones.<BR>
   -Corpse Guarding - Someone dies only to go back to their corpse and die over and over
   from an idiot guarding the body.<BR>
   -Zone Guarding - A group of people sit on one side of a zone so when someone of a
   different team comes in, they get extra shots while the person loads.<BR>
   -Damage over time bug - It's old, and still hasn't been fixed. Cast a Damage over time spell
   on someone and if it kills them, they lose exp.<BR>
   -Charm/Fear Bug - Don't like being charmed/feared? Hit the sit button and you can now
   walk with the spell on. You can also gate and I believe most anything else.<BR>
   For those who enjoyed the information I posted awhile back on the Race War Server, I
   plan to post a new updated one also talking about classes. I know almost nothing about
   PvP, but I've read alot. Hopefully the feedback will tell me if I am wrong. For those who
   want to talk about it, I've created a message board until we get ours back up. It can be
   accessed at <A HREF="http://206.86.100.18:8080/beqlizertempmessageboard">Race War Thougths</A><P>

 Alot of people have sent in some great ideas for surveys.  We hope to include them all, but we 
 have to write the scripts first (and find some time to still EQ).  I expect we'll have the
 surveys up tonight or tomorrow.
