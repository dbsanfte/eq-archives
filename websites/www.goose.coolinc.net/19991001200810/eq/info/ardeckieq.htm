As all journeys start with a beginning, so will mine. Many years have passed and many
battles won and lost. Here I will tell you of my journeys. As I look back on my life and
learn of things that only my gods knew of. I Hope to give you a look at who and what I am.
<br>
<br>
-----I was here:<br>
<br>
I lived in the forests of this place I call home. At one time I had many friends, but
little by little they all changed and went their separate ways. I lived in the forest with
the animals for a long time. My memory passed and those who I knew were no more. I changed
each day into a new being. My life as I knew it had started again, in another time and
form. The only remnants I had were an old tattered tome that I carried with me. It was a
note that I wrote to fellow clan members before my whole life had been reborn. <br>
-----Now my journeys begin:<br>
<br>
I avoided other beings and kept to myself, I felt a strong bond to the woods and animals.
I could sense when others were near and this made it easier for me to avoid them. I was
happy, but something in me was missing, something that moved me from forest to forest. <br>
<br>
I had been wandering the hills and forests for quite some time; not sure where I was
going, but not ever feeling lost. One evening I spied a fire near the foot of a mountain,
so against best judgement I proceeded toward it. Little did I know that my life would soon
be in peril? I stumbled into a camp of dog like creatures, they howled and yipped and
yelled &#147;Halfelf not ruin land!&#148; then attacked me. Unarmed and without knowledge
of my surroundings I became trapped. Heading toward a ridge that was across the way, my
feet had failed me, I ran smack into 3 or more of these dogs that outflanked me. <br>
<br>
Some time later, days, months, minutes? I woke in a cave alone with a brown bear. I tried
to move, but I was too weak. The bear just stood there looking at me, as if he was my
protector. I stared at him for a good long time and drifted off to sleep.<br>
The next time I woke I saw a gray wolf sitting next to a fire that had been built. Still
feeling very tired; I tried to examine myself. Most of my clothes were gone and the
bandages about my body seemed abundant. I found myself waking up many times, but not sure
how long I was out. What only felt like minutes to me could have been days or months?
Opening my eyes for the final time, I saw her kneeling next to me changing my bandages.
She was tall with brown hair and very much a sight for sore eyes. She smiled at me.<br>
<br>
&#147; Well, well, we seem to be getting better by the minute.&#148; She said.<br>
&#147;How long have I been unconscious here?&#148; I asked.<br>
&#147;Umm, well, in and out a lot for about 4 days now. Do you remember what
happened?&#148; she asked. &#147;You suffered a major beating.&#148;<br>
I closed my eyes for a moment and tried to recall.<br>
&#147;I don&#146;t recall much of what happened, I remember dogs or something like
that.&#148; I said.<br>
&#147;Yep, those dogs, we call then Gnolls. I heard the ruckus you started so I went to
investigate. Six on one are not great odds. You are lucky you survived the bashing they
were giving you.&#148; <br>
She then looked straight into my eyes; &#147;If it wasn&#146;t for me you would have been
left for dead.&#148; <br>
Great I thought, what a wonderful thing, to owe a woman a debt of life.<br>
&#147;I shall pay you back some time. You have my word.&#148; I said.<br>
&#147;Well, now that you are awake, and feeling better, I guess I should introduce myself,
I am Cynthia, and you are?&#148;<br>
&#147; I am&#133;? Umm, my name is&#133;? Umm, &#147; I stared blankly at the ceiling.<br>
&#147;Maybe I can help, I have a tome that you had with you when I found you. Take a look
and see if it helps.&#148; She then handed me a torn, wrinkled and barely readable tome.<br>
It read:<br>
~ordred Pendr~~~, Th~~drax, Ardecki-~~~~Goos~~~Bloodbat~~~~<br>
W~iteb~ead, Our final j~~rney to~meet~British will ~~ in 2 days. <br>

~~~~~~~~ ~~~ ~ ~~ ~~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~~ ~ to Britian. We may encounter<br>
som~~~ ~~~~~~ ~~o be ~~~~~ an~ prepaired.<br>
Black~tar~~<br>
<br>
<br>
I looked at it for a few minutes; I was as lost as when I began. I handed it back to
Cynthia.<br>
&#147;What do you think? I can not recall any of this.&#148; <br>
She took it from me and glanced over it.<br>
&#147;Did you write it, or receive it?&#148; she questioned, putting a finger to her lips.<br>
I shrugged my shoulders.<br>
&#147;Umm, you shall be called - Ardecki. Now relax and get some sleep, I am off to get
some dinner for us&#148;, she then spun and left with out a word.<br>
<br>
For the next few days I was allowed to get up and walk around the cave but not allowed to
leave. <br>
Even if I wanted to, there always seemed to be a bear standing at the entrance of the cave
I was in. Tangling with him was not on my to do list. Cynthia would visit me at least
twice a day, for lunch and dinner. We talked about her mostly, since my memory was just
about blank. I asked her what I looked like since my body felt different. The Gnolls also
called me hafelf or something like that. She explained that I appeared to be a cross
between a human and an elf, thus Half-Elf. <br>
<br>
Cynthia asked me, &#147;have you been feeding the bears?&#148;<br>
&#147;No, why do you ask?&#148;<br>
&#147;Normally the bears just ignore us, but this one has been hanging around since we
brought you here.&#148; She replied<br>
&#147; I through you knew him,&#148; I said puzzled.<br>
&#147; Let&#146;s go for a walk. I want to see something&#148;, she stated. &#147;And the
exercise won&#146;t hurt you either.&#148;<br>
We both left the cave and low and behold that bear followed us the whole time. It seemed
to be a giant cave system, along with a flowing river and even a waterfall. After the
second turn I became lost and hoped Cynthia knew where she was going. Finally ending at
another cave entrance.<br>
<br>
&#147; This is the den of Mammoth, He is the oldest and strongest bear of Surefall
Glade.&#148;<br>
I looked at her quizzically.<br>
&#147;OK&#148; I replied<br>
&#147;Slowly walk up to him, &#147;, &#147;What! Are you crazy&#148;. I said.<br>
&#147;Do it! He won&#146;t kill you. I promise&#148; and gave me a quick smile.<br>
<br>
I slowly walked up to this giant bear that could devour me in one gulp. Halfway toward him
the bear that was following us ran past me, stopped in front of Mammoth and growled a low
deep growl. Mammoth growled as if answering. Then the other bear turned around and stood
next to Mammoth. The animals of the forest have never bothered me and they never attacked
me unless provoked. I got kind of nervous when from behind, Cynthia kind of half gasp. I
looked back and she was covering her mouth. Her eyes were wide. The words &#147;he
won&#146;t kill you&#148; kept popping into my head, maybe maul me a few times but not
kill. I kind of smiled to myself and made the last step toward Mammoth. <br>
&#147;Grrowlll&#148; said Mammoth.<br>
&#147;Hello Mammoth, I am Ardecki the Half-Elf, at least that&#146;s what Cynthia
says.&#148; I replied back.<br>
I heard a giggle from behind me.<br>
&#147;GRROOwll&#148;, said Mammoth.<br>
&#147;Well, it was nice meeting you and I am sure we will meet again. Have a nice
day.&#148; I said<br>
Another giggle from behind me.<br>
Mammoth growled again. I turned and looked at Cynthia. <br>
&#147;Ardecki, the bear talker&#148;, she got out between giggles.<br>
&#147;He said you better be nice to me. Or you&#146;ll find some bear treats in you
bed.&#148; I blurted out before my laughter.<br>
We then walked back to our part of the cave and had some food and drink. Cynthia never
said what we went to see Mammoth for. I guess I needed to meet all the bears of the cave. <br>
<br>
The next morning I was awake early, I sensed that Cynthia was coming, so I moved to the
edge of the entrance and planed to scare the pants off her when she entered. <br>
&#147;Boogaboo!&#148; I screamed as I jumped forward in front of her.<br>
She screamed and spinning at the same time a foot landed squarely on my cheek. WAP!<br>
I went sprawling to the floor. <br>
&#147; Holly frigin, I am never going to do that again&#148;, I said as I sat up holding
my face.<br>
&#147;ARDECKI! You scared the begevvers out of me. Are you ok?&#148; she asked.<br>
Pausing a second &#147;Yea, I am ok. But my face hurts like the frigins&#148;<br>
Cynthia kneeled down next to me and laughed right in my face. &#147;Deserves you
right!&#148;<br>
&#147;How did you know I was coming?&#148; she asked.<br>
&#147;I can just sense it. Kind of like a special ability I have.&#148; I replied<br>
&#147;Doesn&#146;t work on Gnolls, huh&#148; she asked.<br>
&#147;It works on most creatures, but I didn&#146;t know what they were and how much they
disliked me&#148; I said.<br>
&#147;Well, I came here early because I wanted to let you know that tomorrow we will be
leaving the caves to meet some people. Today, I want you to roam these caves and learn
them as well as you can. Do not go past the outer waterfall, and don&#146;t let anyone see
you. I will be back tomorrow. Good Luck.&#148; She said as she headed out of the caves.<br>
Not knowing how many tunnels and caves there are I decided to leave a trail. Kind of get a
jump on things. Getting the half loaf of bread, I broke off a chunk and moved to the cave
entrance. Dropped some pieces on the floor and moved on down the tunnel. Dropped some more
crumbs and went some more. I came to a 3-way intersection and while trying to decide which
way to go my friendly bear comes up behind me and eats the bread I dropped.<br>
&#147;No! What are you doing? Don&#146;t eat that.&#148; I said in a humph. <br>
The bear just looked at me. He was smiling. I went back the way I came and he had eaten
the trail. <br>
Mr. Bear was standing there, just looking at me, so I tossed him what was left of the
bread. He ate that too. Going back into my cave I got a stick from the fire and made an X
in the dirt in front of my room. Then moved further up the tunnel and made an arrow
pointing the way I was going. <br>
&#147;AAAA, Stop it!&#148; I yelled as the bear fell to its side and rubbed away the
markings I had made. This is going to be harder than I expected. <br>
Using the Maze method I proceeded down the tunnel always staying to the right. I spent
about half the day doing this, and got the general layout. I hadn&#146;t sensed any people
so I decided to make a run of the tunnels just going whichever way I turned. I came out to
the cave waterfall and stopped. Someone was around. I was cornered, only one way out
unless I went into the water. Sliding into the cool water to get out of sight. Someone was
standing right above my head on the bank. I wasn&#146;t sure how long I could hold my
breath. With in a few seconds he turned and left. I hope he didn&#146;t see me. I moved
down the tunnel and he was gone. I waited a minute or two and then continued my run. Later
that evening I had basic knowledge of where all the tunnels went and how to get back to my
cave. I wanted to go back to the waterfall and check out the pond that was there some
more. Moving into the pond, the water had to go somewhere, I traced the edges and down
near the bottom there was a cave that went into darkness. I wondered where it went. I
practiced holding my breath a few times then decided that I would give it a try. I took a
few deep breaths then dove for the cave. Swimming down its length I couldn&#146;t see the
end. It then turned to the left and went down more. I felt I was past the halfway mark and
if I didn&#146;t see the end soon I was going to be in a lot of trouble. Finally, the end,
but my sight was getting hazy, I didn&#146;t think I was going to make it. Out of the
tunnel and just a few feet up. I couldn&#146;t hold my breath any longer; I inhaled a
mouth full of water. Choking, I lost sight of the surface. My body reacted with a cough
but to no avail. I sucked in some more water. Still kicking my feet I hit the surface.
Coughing up the water which was left and sucking in some air. My body was not treading
water. I looked for an exit, but there were high walls all around me. Clinging to some
jutting rocks I laid there, half in and half out of the water. My lungs burned with each
breath. I for sure would not make the trip back unless I rested for a while. I clung there
for around 2 hours, then the chill was starting to kick in. I would have to do something
or I would be stuck here and probably die. High walls all around me. I could see a ledge
way up but the walls were to steep for me to climb. I decided to try and get back, at
least on the other side I might be found If I don&#146;t make it. I swam around a little
to try and get warmed up. Moving to the top of the tunnel so to make the trip under water
shorter I took 3 deep breaths then went under. Swimming back the way I came, I hoped there
were no other passages that I missed on the way in. Up and to the right I swam as hard as
I could. Within a few feet of the end of the tunnel, something hit me in the back,
knocking what air I had out of me. Turning to see a giant fish moving toward me again.
WAM. It hit me, this time taking a bite out of my side. The water turned a blurry red as I
inhaled a mouth full of water and kicked with all my strength to reach the end of the
tunnel. I was moving blind now, I didn&#146;t know if my eyes were open or closed. My body
was trying to eject the water as I was trying to inhale fresh air. I felt something hit
the top of my head. <br>
<br>
As I found out afterwards a piranha was attacking me. As I lost conscience my body floated
to the surface, where that bear was standing, looking into the water. He jumped in the
pulled me to shore by my arm. <br>
<br>
I awoke slowly and bleary eyed. My side stung and my left arm and wrist hurt and were cut.
Water was dripping onto me from the large wet bear that stood above me. The sullen sound
of the waterfall and exhaustion soon put out my lights. <br>
<br>
&#147;ARDECKI! ARDECKI! Oh my god. ARDECKI!&#148;<br>
I opened my eyes as my bear let out a fighting growl. Still standing over me his hair was
standing on end. <br>
&#147;ARDECKI! No, don&#146;t get any closer, It may hurt him. ARDECKI, get up.
Ardecki.&#148; echoed in my ears.<br>
A low growl erupted from the bear, not letting anyone or anything close. I reached up and
ran my hand down the bears&#146; chest. Its growl stopped short and his head came down to
meet mine in a stare. <br>
&#147;Its ok, let them near, they are here to help.&#148; I said as I patted his chest.<br>
&#147;Reooon&#148; he replied and moved to the side still watching.<br>
&#147;Cynthia, its safe, he won&#146;t kill you, haha, I promise&#148; I laughed
in-between sessions of pain that came from my side.<br>
&#147;What happened?&#148; she asked as she ran forward to comfort me.<br>
Just then a blue light radiated around me and some of my pains went away. <br>
&#147;Did you fall into the water? What happened? Where does it hurt? Are you ok? Answer
me.&#148; Damn it.<br>
&#147;You didn&#146;t go in that water, theres piranha in there. And it&#146;s a dead end
if you go through that cave&#148;<br>
I started laughing and with each laugh it hurt more. <br>
&#147;Relax, I am ok now, Ill tell you my story in a min or to. Let me clear the
cobwebs&#148; I said.<br>
Blue light radiated around me again. <br>
There were 2 other guys with her and they leaned me up against the wall. I briefly
described what happened.<br>
The 2 guys were grinning ear to ear as I explained. Cynthia applied ointment to my wounds.<br>
&#147;So you think she likes him?&#148; said one guy.<br>
&#147;Haha, think. Man she&#146;s in love&#148; replied the other<br>
Both guys just about fell over in their laughter. Cynthia didn&#146;t even look, just
continued and listened. <br>
Freshly bandaged again. They hefted me to my feet and we walked out toward the 2nd
waterfall. <br>
&#147; I guess I failed my tests.&#148; I said.<br>
&#147;Actually, you have amazed me once again.&#148; She said.<br>
&#147; I think we shall take the other path, since we don&#146;t want to make you any
wetter.&#148;<br>
Moving toward a dead end I stopped at the wall and the 2 guys pushed me through. <br>
&#147;Ooout!&#148; he said as he pushed.<br>
The other guy laughing as it happened. We went right through the wall. A secret entrance. <br>
&#147;Welcome to Surefall Glade, Home of the Ranges and Druids.&#148; Cynthia said.<br>
The 2 guys left as we walked around the area. Cynthia showed me the Rangers Cabin, and the
giant tree, which the Druids used. There was also a small hut where you could purchase
supplies and such.<br>
&#147;Talking with the Guild masters of all the things you have told me we have decided to
let you join one of our guilds if you so please.&#148; Cynthia explained.<br>
We entered the Rangers Hut, which was built on stilts in the middle of a pond where the
main waterfall pored. She handed me two books.<br>
&#147;All I ask is that you read these 2 books and then make a decision. I will leave you.
Come outside, Ill be fishing off the pier when you finish.&#148; <br>
I moved into a corner and sat against the wall and opened the first book. After I
finished, I kept reopening the Ranger book rereading and wondering. I sat there for quite
a long time. I had seen Cynthia peek in the door a few times as I sat there, I could track
her movements, as well as the brown bear that appeared outside the cabin lounging at the
end of the dock in the grass.<br>
I got up and went outside, Cynthia was as bright eyed as ever. My friendly bear was
sitting there eating daisies. <br>
&#147;Have you decided?&#148; she asked.<br>
&#147;If you don&#146;t mind, may I keep these until tomorrow, then I will make my
decision.&#148; I said.<br>
&#147;Sure, I think that&#146;s a reasonable request. Lets get some food and go back to
the cave.&#148; She said.<br>
&#147;Come on Bear. Were leaving&#148; I gestured to him to come.<br>
&#147;Errrooorr&#148; he replied.<br>
Back in the cave after Cynthia left I read both of the books again late into the night.<br>
<br>
The next morning I made my way to the Rangers Cabin. Sitting down in the grass with my
feet dangling in the water. Many people moving about doing their daily deeds. I lay back
in the grass looking at the sky listening to the waterfall. I made my decision. I also
wondered what Cynthia would do when she found I was missing again.<br>
&#147;ARDECKI, are you trying to give me a nervous breakdown?&#148; she yelped.<br>
&#147;Noooo. Cynthia, I am not. I have made my decision&#148;<br>
She looked at me. &#147;And&#148; <br>
&#147;I would like to train as a Ranger. Now what do I do?&#148; I stated<br>
She was all smiles, she sat down next to me and crossed her legs.<br>
&#147;Well. I will speak with the guild Masters and tomorrow you will begin training. You
may continue to use the caves as your home.&#148; She said.<br>
We both lay back in the grass looking at the sky. I felt her hand move over and lay on top
of mine. I smiled to myself and I felt really good.</p>
