<p>It now feels strange, sitting as Elder of the Temple, to look back on slightly more
than 300 years of history. Being old, even by Dwarf standards, makes the cold and damp
darkness of night create pangs from poorly knitted bones and other abuses my small frame
has endured, dulling my memories. It is times like now, with the warm sun on me and deep
in the healing of meditation that I can remember well enough to tell of the world as I
have seen it. I can tell of many worlds, but the relevance would elude most, I can tell of
many adventures within these other realms, but confusion of mind would cloud -
understanding would again escape your grasp. This story must be told from the prospective
of history, as my beginning was lost for many years, deep in the nether regions of the
mind, in those places where dreams are born - but my dreams were of faces, names, murder
and treachery! Only after I was well neigh 100 and just coming into my prime did some the
reasons for my occasional nightmares start to slowly come back to me. It is of these early
times I must tell so you may understand the tales that follow. Keep in mind, that the soul
of every sentient protects itself from harm as best it can. I my case, this protection
came in the form of permanent gaps in my previous history - just as well I guess - some
things are best left forgotten so the mind can heal itself and life can go on.</p>

<p>I, for some reason, have always been drawn to chronicle the things I and others of note
have accomplished. This was a strange compulsion, even from my earliest memories as a
youngster of 45. Once accepted to the temple of the Paladin&#146;s, one of my first
passions was the art of writing ( as well as the art of protecting my hide and the ever
present evasion of hunger). True understanding of what a Paladin is and why I
instinctively chose that profession in this life came many years later. Now that I have
the weight of time and memory upon me, I feel the need to lighten them by passing the
understanding on to the next generation to prevent their loss.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>As a youngster in the city of Kaladin, I found I tended to stay on the fringes between
the enlightened and wealthy and darker destitute sides of town. The very idea that a dwarf
was such a small creature among the sentient and non-sentient creatures of this world
never came to mind as all I needed was within the walls of our town. The Evil I knew was
limited to the occasional thief I would chase or bully I would stand up to ( often to my
embarrassment after getting a thorough thrashing as payment for my actions). I believe
everyone knows in their hearts what evil is and deals with it in their own way. What I can
tell you, is life within protected city walls cannot ever provide you an understanding of
worldly evil. Even after I gained much respect within my town, I had no idea that the
perils before me in my coming journeys would cost me so dearly in ways I would not care to
put down here.</p>

<p>In the beginning, I was called the &quot;Orphaned One&quot;, because I could not
remember my lineage and considered weak of mind because I could not remember anything
before the age of 45. Skills my peers had, things they would do naturally were a total
mystery to me. I even had to learn to talk the Dwarf native language because I could not
get them to understand my words. The only reason the elders could believe as to why I came
here was that I was abandoned by parents seeking to rid themselves of a mental defective -
trusting to the kind nature of the Dwarf Race that I would be cared for. For a long time,
even I believed these things. Believe that is, till my past started to surface.</p>

<p>I spoke in the beginning of strange lands and deeds. The only relevant thing I need
impart from those events is that a band of travelers - warriors all - were lead astray by
an evil being called a &quot;British&quot;. I have seen this creature - but that is
another story. These travelers came to this world through a dimensional portal. It was
meant to be a trap for the group that entered it, it worked, all too well. The one
additional hitch was that the creature known as The British was ensnared within his own
trap and was transported to the ethereal realm of the Gods of this world instead of the
world itself - more on this in a moment as we did not discover this till many years later.</p>

<p>Our names in the other world were BlackStar, Thundrax and I was called by Mordred
Pendragon. There was another with us, but he did not survive the crossing.</p>

<p>Upon arrival, we sought to return home. Gradually, we came to realize that we were in
someone else&#146;s world now. Near our landing, we found pieces of a broken crystal and a
stone with strange markings on it. Over time, I assembled many of the stone fragments, but
could only make out the name BR__IN, the rest was too smashed to piece together. We all
agreed that this was the device that brought us here and also was the only thing that
could return us. With this knowledge, despair set it. </p>

<p>We sought shelter in the nearby forest close to a small stream where we found another
band of humans sent here just as ourselves. There was water and plenty of game so we
decided that there was safety in numbers in a strange land. Soon the others began to tell
us of other humans that had once been with them, but, in time simply dissapeared or went
mad and ran off. It wasn&#146;t long after that we would notice a loss in the ranks, one
or more would simply walk away, sometimes for days. Each time they returned, the others
would notice something different about them. They were changed in size, temperament or
abilities. Eventually, one by one , each band member departed and simply never came back..
It seems strange now that we simply accepted this as the way things were supposed to
happen. </p>

<p>The first to leave the group was the largest and possibly the fiercest among us. He
evolved from his past form into a mighty Troll. This creature is empowered with much
strength and makes a formidable opponent for nearly any creature within the world. He
simply awoke one morning , picked up an old rusty ax that lay nearby and walked away. His
departure path was through the deepest parts of the forest and we soon lost track of him.
The last we heard was a bellowing voice of rage and anger from deep within the mountain
region that lay just ahead.</p>

<p>Within a few weeks, I could no longer understand the Forest Dweller, his speech was
strange and his quick movements made me slightly on edge. One night while he was away on
one of his trips, I simply picked up my meager possessions, a portion of the food and
headed off in a direction that felt strangely like the way home. During this trek I lost
all memory of the others and found myself at the gates of Kalidan, broke, starved and at
the end of my strength. Here I was taken in by creatures of my own kind - more out of
sympathy than anything else.</p>

<p>My personal exploits will follow in other sessions, but I must follow this train of
thought while I am still able to keep the events clear in my mind.</p>

<p>In time, there was only one left. He remained within the forest realm.</p>

<p>This forest dweller forgot the reason for his stay, but the forest was his natural home
now. His ability to control animals allowed him to enter even the darkest of the forest
regions with ease. The only thing that nagged him was the puzzled look he would give
himself each time he saw his own reflection. He felt the urge to seek and finish a job
that had been started - but what job? Years later, I realized that this individual, though
changed greatly from his former self, was the one we called BlackStar.</p>

<p>During my future travels, guided by tales of wandering Bards and legends, I came to
realize that the creature known as the British has many enemies in his past life. The
procedure of banishment to another dimension was his punishment of choice - used most
often in ridding himself of those that opposed him. I found that my group was the last of
his victims sent to this other region. Once knowing that there were others with knowledge
of my past I felt the urge to seek them out. This urge was almost as strong as my desire
to be a Paladin, though Dwarf Palidans are rare, I am proof that they do exist. This
persona held me in good stead during my ventures.</p>

<p>Many races accepted me with ease, many respected the honor that goes with being a
Paladin and those that underestimated my abilities often did not live to regret their
mistakes. I eventually located some of my former brethren, save for the one known as
BlackStar. Stories continued to surface about a forest dweller with strange ways that
lived out beyond the wasteland, deep within the hills and forests. None could approach him
without his consent, he had little contact with other creatures but was known for being
fair in his dealings and fond of the creatures within his forest domain. We all knew that
this was our BlackStar. Without another thought, we set off in search of the one of the
few remaining living members of our original group.</p>

<p>In the twilight of my life, I have often pondered how we came to be as we are today.
Most of us changed physically as well as mentally - AFTER we arrived. I now clearly
remember that we were all human when we first came to this world. As I approach the end of
my life, my Palidan God has seen fit to allow glimpses of things that mortals should never
know. When the first group arrived from the foreign land, they were fierce fighters,
thieves, murderers - the dregs of society. The Gods sought the place from whence they came
and found that their world had become a dumping ground for ones that created problems for
a creature that came to be known as British. Many of these early ones were killed or
simply went mad with the knowledge of what happened to them. Not all of the Gods of this
world are without compassion, so it was decided that a means of aiding these unfortunate
ones sent here without hope and a method of trapping the one responsible for the problem
be devised.</p>

<p>It came to pass that the Gods decreed that each new traveler would be transformed into
a creature that best suited his/her temperament. This would insure that the balance of
nature would remain constant as they would be seeded within the existing races and
creatures. In addition, memories of their former lives would be blocked till such time as
each was able too accept their fate by virtue of having built a life here - provided they
lived that long. As for British? Well, the Gods lay their trap. When he created the last
portal rift to send our band through, his escape route was blocked and he was sent here,
to this world. They found him a vile, evil creature in human form. They knew that if he
were to be loosed upon the world in an acceptable form that he would quickly marshal the
forces of this place and eventually could even threaten the Gods themselves. It was the
God&#146;s next decision that created a life long quest for many. </p>

<p>The decision was made to place the British in the form of a Dragon. In this way he
would not be in position to challenge the Gods and was open to the perils of the world
itself. As an added punishment for his deeds, his memories of what he was and what was
done to him were left intact and he was banished to the lonely lost regions of the far
distant cold mountains to suffer his fate and live out his days in cold induced pain. This
drove the British insane and in his insanity he killed all that ventured within his grasp.
</p>

<p>This is where the story of the members of the Guards of Honor Clan begins. This clan is
not unlike other clans as it is made-up of various creatures and guilds from throughout
the world. It&#146;s singular unique quality lay in the fact that almost to a man, they
remember a past not of this world and seek revenge and a rebuilding of the lives that were
ripped away from them. Most of all, they seek peace of mind.</font></p>
