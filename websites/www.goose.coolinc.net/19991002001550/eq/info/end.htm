<b>Black Panther Guild</b><p>

We gather at the guild house, preparing for our annual trek to Lord British's Castle.  This will be the eighth year for the Black Panther Guild.  Our mission of ridding this land of evil has gone well.  Every trick and turn that got thrown at us was caught and dealt with.  Our strategy and training has made us a force to be reckon with.  British is surly steaming over our accomplishments.  We make this trek to talk with British and try to get him to change his ways, but as of yet, he will have nothing to do with us.<br>
 Thundrax, Mordred Pendragon, WhiteBread, Goose, BloodBath, Ardecki-GOH and I walked to Lord British's castle.  Tis locked, as it has been every time we make this journey,  in the 8 years that I have been in Britannia, Lord British has avoided my gaze.  I think of what will happen when I finally meet him.  From the trances Mordred cast upon me, I feel the encounter would not be a happy one.  <br>
We all teleport into the courtyard and proceed into the throne room.  Once again the faithful Lord of Britannia is no where to be found.  <br>
&quot;Rest Black Panther&quot;, I tell my friends.  &quot; We will wait to see if this so called &quot;Lord&quot; will grace us with his presence.&quot;<br>
&quot;I feel once again, our trip is in earnest.  Tis a shame when the ruler of this land can not be seen.&quot;<br>
Then from behind a curtain a lad appeared. Twas not British.  He approached me and said.<br>
&quot;Great Lord BlackStar, Lord British would like to meet with you and your Guild.   He is with Lord Blackthorn and wants me to gate you there.&quot;, he smiled and waited for a response.
The Panthers all stood. Waiting for my response. <br>
&quot;Where is he &quot;, I questioned. <br>
&quot;He is at Lord Blackthorns castle, milord.&quot; he replied<br>
&quot;No need to gate us , We can walk, we have walked this far.&quot; I told him.<br>
He gave a smug look and headed toward the gate.  We followed and he open the portcullis so we would not have to teleport.  <br>
&quot;Sir if you would, please tell Lord British you denied the gate, for he will be very upset with me.&quot; he asked.<br>
Just then a cold chill ran up my back, I could see images of this lad being beaten for not obeying orders.  Then there was something else.  I could not tell what it was.  I gestured to Mordred to be alert and he passed the warning back to the others.<br>
&quot;I will tell British I made you walk.&quot; I finally replied.<br>
&quot;O thank you sir, thank you&quot;, he said.<br>
Into Blackthorns castle and up to the second floor.  For the first time in eight years.  British was in my sight.  He wore his royal clothes and crown, I was not impressed in the least.  He smiled when he saw me and cut his eyes at the lad. <br>
&quot;I made the lad walk British,  He offered to gate and I denied. &quot; I shot at him.<br>
Looking back to me, British smiled again.  &quot;Take leave Lad, get the food ready and return when your done. I shall deal with you later.&quot; British said.<br>
&quot;Take a seat, I am privileged to finally meet the Black Panther Guild.  I have heard of your accomplishments.&quot; he said with a smile.<br>
I locked onto his eyes,  the look and sound were only a cover for what really was hidden deep in British, pain, torment and evil.  With everyone seated I then took a chair across from British at the table.  Mordred had beads of sweet appearing on his brow.  He knew something was a miss.  If something did happen the odds were against us, for British's guards would take our lives with out hesitation.  <br>
&quot;So what great adventures have thee been into?&quot; British asked.<br>
Mordred pulled out a cloth and wiped his forehead.  He knew I would not play fair.<br>
&quot;Well! There are so many. Where can I start?  Just the other day we killed four thieves that were using Your guards to kill the citizens of Trinsic.&quot; I stated.<br>
&quot;My guards?,  I dont think so,  Maybe people dressed as guards?  For the guards of the towns would never kill any one that didn't deserve it.&quot; he replied.<br>
I snickered.<br>
&quot;Sir__?, Lord__?, British!, you need to get out more,  your guards are as corrupt as yo&quot;&quot;BlackSTAR&quot;, Mordred blurted out cutting my words short. &quot;Excuse me, I___ O, Damn, I forgot what I wanted to say.&quot; <br>
Mordred did not forget, for he knew this conversation was going to turn ugly. He was trying to change the course of destiny.  
British's smile was gone.<br>
&quot;Goos____, Blackstar!, The guards are not corrupt and the cities are safe.&quot; he grinned.<br>
&quot;This from a man who does not leave his castle.  You have much to learn and much to see.&quot; I said.<br>
Just then the lad appeared and announced the food was ready.  Mordreds sigh of relief told a story all its own..<br>
&quot;We shall gate there, The lad will lead&quot; announced British.<br>
We all got up and moved to the adjacent room and waited for the gate to be created.  British walked up near me, he was smiling again.  I did not like it one bit, and my senses were still feeling a vibration I could not understand.  <br>
&quot;Follow me.&quot; British said as the gate appeared.  Then stopped in front of it.<br>
&quot;BlackStar.  you have been a hindrance and a burden to me for eight years, and now you will be no more!&quot;  a evil smile raced across his face.  He then said in a calm cool voice &quot;Guards&quot; and stepped into the portal.<br>
A split second later BloodBath was struck down by a guard. <br>
&quot;ATTACK&quot; I yelled as my body filled with rage.  <br>
Just then two energy bolts struck the guard,  I feared these actions would call more guards.   Thundrax sprung forward with ax in hand, diving then rolling toward the stunned guard.  The  ax landed square in the guards chest.  The guard fell to the floor.  
Thundrax then picked up the slain BloodBath and all eyes turned to me.  <br>
&quot;KOS British&quot; I said, then stepped into the gate. <br> The others followed with out hesitation.
The forces in this gate were not normal.  I could see everyone that entered.  Then a bright flash of white light. 
We are all standing in a forest some where.  British was no where to be seen.  I used my tracking skill and could not pick up his trail.  Goose pulled out his sextant and took some coordinates.  We waited for Goose to finish.<br>
&quot;Hold on&quot; goose said. as he checked again.  &quot;Umm,&quot;<br>
&quot;Where are we Goose!&quot; Mordred demanded.<br>
Goose checked the sextant again.<br>
&quot;GOOSE!&quot; Mordred yelled.<br>
&quot; I don't Know, I dont know where the hell we are.&quot; Gooses bellowed back.<br>
Everyone was looking at each other,  I walked up to Goose and asked him to check , then I would check and we would compare readings.<br>
&quot;O.K. your turn&quot; Goose said.<br>
Taking a reading from the sextant would give you coordinates, which you would chart on your map.  Well it appears that the coordinates that both Goose and I got, did not appear on any map we had.<p>

<b>We were not in Britannia any more.</b>
