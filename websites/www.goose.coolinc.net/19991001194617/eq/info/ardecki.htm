<b>Ardecki - GOH</b><br>
<font SIZE="3" FACE="COMIC SANS MS">(by - Mordred Pendragn)</font><p>
<p>
</center>
 Once, he carried the Shield-of-Honor with pride. He knew in his heart that he belonged to a noble cause, destined to cleanse the land of the scumish slime known only as PK&#146;s. These were people that sought out others for the shear pleasure of killing and took much delight in dismembering their prey.  Through his training in the Guard, he knew them to be a cowardly lot, prone to trickery, thievery and masters in the art of mass attack. If you saw one PK, rest assured that others were near and hidden or he had taken refuge inside the sanctuary of a town.<p>

 During his career there were many battles both won and lost. The scars of the lost began to run deep and the 
man-made breaks in his bones sorely reminded him of his failures on cold wet days. It was on one of these days, when the wind howled and snow was driven, that he met a Wanderer who willingly shared his shelter, fire and food. This man boasted of many battles but bore few of the scars and Ardecki began to doubt the truthfulness of the stories and question in more detail.<p>

&#147;Ah ha &#147; the Wanderer laughed, &#147; another doubting Thomas, let me prove to you that there are more ways of fighting that by mere sword and brutish magic.&#148; With this, Ardecki soon found himself out in the cold, in mortal battle with a tree! Try as he might, he could not force himself to stop the fight and he began to tire. After the Wandered recovered from his fit of laughter, he did something and Ardecki was able to return to the fire.<p>

 &#147; What did you do to me - are you a warlock?&#148; Ardecki said through a cold rasped voice as he reached for his sword.<br>

&#147; NO!&#148; replied the Wandered. &#147;I am simply showing you that there is more to the world than what they teach you in the Guard. Stay with me for a few days, share a portion of your food and a small token of your wealth and I will teach you what I know of this&#148; <br>
<p>
 Realizing the things he could accomplish, Ardecki agreed. For the next few weeks, he trained with music, enticement and other arcane arts not taught within the guild. He longed to return to the fold and show them the wonders of fighting without actual combat. He was shown the effect of these musical &#147;Arts&#148; on humans, animals and various beasts of the land. Finally they found themselves at the South Gate of Trinsic.<p>
The Wanderer told him, &#147; return now to your brothers in arms, show them the ways I have taught you and you all will be stronger for it. I am bound for the cold lands of the north on the next tide. I bid you well&#148;  and with this, the Wanderer headed out onto the docks.
<p>
 Ardecki quickly made his way to the guild hall only to be met by his brothers in arms baring his way.<br>
 &#147;Go away evil one before we end your days here and now!&#148; one of them shouted at him.
<br>
&#147;Do ye not know your own brother fool, I am Ardecki-GOH!&#148; Ardecki replied.
<br>
&#147;Ye are no longer GOH, ye have been banned for heresy and molesting the general populace and attacking the innocent - you are now known to us as the EVIL ARDECKI - if we see the likes of you again surely you will die by our hand&#148; the eldest warrior said.
<br>
 &#147;But I trained only to help the clan&#148; Ardecki railed.
<br>
&#147;You allowed yourself to be deceived by an imposter is what you did, you have done evil about the land and now you will be banished - never shall you hold a GOH shield again!&#148; the elder was almost ready to strike Ardecki Down now, so he left for town to find the Wanderer.
<p>
Ardecki ran out on the dock as the Wanderer&#146;s boat was leaving and he yelled out to him <br>
&#147; What has thou done to get me banned by my own brothers!&#148; 
<br>
&#147;I will show you now what I have done&#148; the Wanderer said as he invoked an incantation removing the spell of incognito revealing his true name &#145;Ghost Face-ROT&#146;, As you now see, it is by design that you are as you are now. I, and MY brothers travel the lands seeking new GOH fools that can be driven from the fold. We know the Guard is strong, but we also know that without new members it&#146;s days are numbered.&#148; Ghostface said in a fading voice across the sound of the waves.
 <p>
 Ardecki shouted &#147; I shall hut thee to the ends of the earth, no rest shall I seek till the day your bones lie bleached on the sands and your final death is posted for all to see!&#148;
<br>
Ghost face simply laughed and waved as his boat receded from shouting distance.
<p>
Ardecki made his way to the Keg and Anchor to drown his sorrows. As he sat with his bottle a noble cane and inquired if he could share his table. Ardecki agreed  telling the man that there were few that would do so.
<p>
&#147;My name is BlackStar, and I know much of your plight - I also know the individual you are now drinking over&#148; he said in a quite voice. &#147;I have a guild that could use a man of your talents, and use them strictly for honorable purposes&#148; Lord BlackStar stated lowly.
<br>
&#147;I am beyond redemption, why would you, a noble lord, want me a former GOH within your guild&#148; Ardecki inquired.
<br>
&#147;Let us say, evil is fought in many forms, by many weapons. The curse you now carry can be a blessing if used for it&#146;s proper purpose, and not twisted as Ghostface would have you do. Turn your hatred of him to strength and resolve. Trust me when I say that I know the hearts of men and I know yours to be good - Join me&#148; BlackStar stated a little loudly.
<br>
&#147; I have sworn to kill this Ghostface-ROT , and that is my quest&#148; Ardecki stated. 
<br>
&#147;I heard your oath, but what you do not know is that I know where he lives&#148; BlackStar said.
<br>
&#147;You know where he lives! Tell me now so I may seek my revenge&#148; Ardecki stood, livid with rage
<br>
&#147;I will tell you this thing, but, I want your services first. As I said, I need a man of your talents, besides, there are 5 of them in his dwelling and you would never get past them alone. If you join us, I as Guild Master swear that the day will come and you  will be allowed to take your revenge on your sworn enemy&#148; BlackStar said.
<br>
&#147;The promise of a Lord of Honor I will take, I will follow you and I will use my skills in your service, but remember this, I will bind thee to thy oath when the time comes to settle with Ghostface-ROT&#148; Ardecki said and grasped the out stretched hand of Lord BlackStar.
