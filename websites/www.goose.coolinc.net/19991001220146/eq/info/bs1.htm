<b>The Lore of
The Black Panther</b> <br>
Chronicled by <br>
Mordred Pendragn<p></center>


 This is from a time when stories were handed down from generation to generation by word of mouth. Contained within is an account of these times, scribed by me, as spoken by my Lord &amp; Master - BlackStar.<p>

 Know ye that it is the age of magic, dragons and evil, a time long before the creation of Britannia as you know it today. A mighty war was raging across the world with the leaders of the many factions fighting to gain ultimate control. As it happens, My master was a Serf in the employ of an Evil Master called Sir British. Goose served his duties well, in near servitude to the Evil Sir British, never questioning the tasks given him. For his unwavering loyalty, Sir British guaranteed Goose a place in his new Realm once he became victorious.<p>

 As the years of war neared their apocalyptic climax, The Serf Goose had risen to the exalted rank of Knight and given the name Blackstar to reflect the many enemies who's light he had extinguished from the sky. Sir British was granted, via conquest, the title Lord British. Sensing victory near at hand, Lord British became more and more demanding of his servants but also withdrew into his inner realm to plot his future. On the fateful day that the world shattered, Lord British realized he could never rule the entire world and he went mad with rage.<p>

 As the shard of the world that came to be known as Britannia formed, lord British released his rage upon the hapless inhabitants that remained. He drained the magical powers and life energies from creatures, mages, servants - anyone that displeased him, leaving a pathetic shriveled husk behind. Eventually, Lord British had gained so much Magic and life force that he became near immortal. This immortality did not slacken his rage, but drove it into the torture of the innocent by casting them into a pit of Lions so he could feed his anger from their cries of agony. 
<p>
 Able to stand these atrocities no more, Sir Blackstar confronted Lord British in the Halls of Justice. He implored his master to seek a different path, to put aside his rage and killing ways or else he would have to take up arms against him.  Lord British raged, lashed out at the young knight catching him unaware.
<p>
Sir Blackstar awoke in the Death pit, a place used to sacrifice people to the amusement of Lord British. His gaze drifted through the haze to see himself surrounded by Lord British and his court looking down on him. He found his hands bound behind him but he was able to speak. In the dim corners of the arena came the low snarls and sleek movements that could only be from large cats.
<p>
 &quot;For crimes against Me - I condemn you to a fools death!&quot; bellowed Lord British. &quot; I brought you along - lifted you from obscurity only to have you turn. It is here that I will teach you your final lesson, a lesson on how to die like the ungrateful dog you are.&quot; <br>With that, the cages were opened and the now unmistakable shape of black panthers came into view. Within moments they had seized the helpless Sir Blackstar and began to rend the flesh from his bones.
<p>
 Even through the pain that burned like a hot knife, Sir Blackstar shouted in defiance..<br>
&quot; I Renounce you and your knighthood, I Die not as Sir Blackstar, but simply Blackstar - I curse you and all your kind with my last breath, I swear that if it is possible, I will return to set the scales of justice in balance and come for you!&quot;
<p>
 Shortly after this sight, Lord British began to see visions, have nightmares and be fearful of all around him. He sought to erase his former deeds by placing the blame on others. He created the &quot;Guards of Honor&quot; a mere show of force from poorly trained commoners. He set the law of the land and created safe zones in the land but allowed his guards to only protect to a limited degree and within strict limits. With these minimal restrictions, he knew that his evil would continue to flourish in the Wilds of Britannia but it would look as if he was a force for good because of his protection of the towns.
<p>
 Years later, a young man came from the deep woods, a mighty warrior dressed in Black Plate possessing a fighting style that made him able to defeat all that would kill him. He called himself BlackStar. As his fame spread, legends grew from many sources, some have said that they have even seen him transform into a Black Panther after the death of an especially worthy foe, but, I have never witnessed this. Some even say that he is the ghost of Sir Blackstar that was killed by the order of Lord British for standing up for things that were right; These things my master will neither confirm nor deny. I do know that My master has created a Guild devoted to fighting evil within the wilds of Britannia but the exact manner of it's operations remain a secret even to me. The only thing he will say on the subject - and I quote &quot;.... one day soon, the legions of evil will dwindle, Lord British will tremble and the name BlackStar will invoke admiration and fear in all corners of the land...&quot;
<p>
 So it was said.. So it was written..
