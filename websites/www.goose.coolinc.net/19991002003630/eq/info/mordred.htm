Mordred Pendragn<br>
(autobiography)
<p>
</center>
</b>
 I was well into middle age at the time of the shattering. In the old world, the history of my family line was fraught with greatness, disaster and misery. My father, Mordred Sr. was the illicit son of Otha Pendragon and his sister Morgana. Although my grandfather passed down the sword Excaliber to my father, it was lost when I was ten, during the  Battle of The Moores with Dear-O&#146;l-Dad&#146;s supposed death. With my only claim to fame, Excaliber, gone forever, I sought out the now aged Merlin; who still occupied the caves by the coast, under the ancient Pendragon Castle.
<br>
 Merlin was nearly blind and crippled from a combination of old age and the toll that comes from years of  dabbling in the blacker arts of Magery and Magic. I think he allowed me to stay more out of loneliness and loyalty to my grandfather than wanting an apprentice. During the three remaining years of his life he did try to teach the less painful items of magic, slight of hand, and the art of Magery Battle. All too soon, he passed - he was sitting by the fire one evening and simply said, &#147;... I have reached the fullness of my time here... please take my Book of Spells, use them to better yourself. Maybe one day the fates will once again favor the name Pendragon...&#148; and with that, he simply vanished from sight, leaving only his faded spell book and Wizard&#146;s hat.
<br>
 The Book, for the most part, was unreadable save for a few of the spells. I found that by studying the pages, over time, while wearing the hat, that more and more was readable and I would rewrite the spells, slowly filling the book. The hours were long and tedious and I never figured out if this was by the Old Man&#146;s design or the book was faded just by old age. Either way, I found that as I mastered simple things, that I could start to  understand the more difficult spells, but never close to the level attained my Merlin.
<br>
 In an effort to support myself, I worked a traveling side show as a slight of hand artist and would occasionally provide a feat of magic, if the money was right and the reagents were available. In time, I grew weary about trying to figure out the rest of the book and kept it safely along with the Hat in my sack with my necessities and memories.
<br>
 Then came a time that I witnessed the Shattering. It came as a series of thunderclaps and colored lights like the sun through a prism. When all was said and done, I found myself on a small nameless island. It was there I again began reading the book, as I had only myself to entertain. Even with much struggling, the lack of reagents still hampered my finishing the book. Eventually, a passing ship picked me up and I wandered with the ships owner, Robert. Robert was a seaman for sure, fights of any kind were his fun, but I quickly found that my days of combat were long past and that Magic was starting to take it&#146;s toll on my body as it had Merlin&#146;s. I relegated myself to healing his wounds and navigating for him. 


<br>
One evening Robert failed to return to the ship. Later, I found that he had gotten into a fight in town and was killed by the guards, resurrected on sight and taken into slavery by Lord British. Within days, Robert was forced to sell-off his boat so he could buy his freedom. When  I last saw him he was headed out the western gate, begging for food. I spent the next year using my magic to support myself again, but now, I also used it in the service of the sick, injured and homeless. Many of the local warrior&#146;s scoffed at me for my activities, save one, a curious sort named BlackStar. Often he would just stand nearby as I ministered to the sick or fed the starving. One day he approached me and said, &#147; .. follow me to my home, I would speak with you of things you know not...&#148; Curious, I followed this stranger into the wilderness, something I had never done before nor since.
<br>
 It was during the course of this meeting that he invited me to join the BlackPanther guild. I told him that I would be of little use as a warrior in the battle for light, but, he said, &#147;... there are more ways of fighting, as you should be aware. Look to your books, I and the other Guild members will aid you in learning what you need to know. When you are ready, you may join us in battle with skills that few possess. Remember Mordred, any fool can wield a sword, but, it takes a truly wise man to see his limitations.&#148; It is from that day forward that I have trained in the arcane arts of Magic and Magery. Due to my advanced schooling, BlackStar requested that I serve the guild as it&#146;s Scribe. He said that many would wish their story told and a record of the valiant should be kept. To insure I lacked for nothing, he permitted me to charge 500 Gold for my services and a portion of any booty that was taken on raids I took part in.
