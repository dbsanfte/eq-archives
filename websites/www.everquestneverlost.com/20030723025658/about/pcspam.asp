			Netster.com does not send Spam, never has and never will. Nor do we condone or tolerate the 
			sending of Spam by anyone associated with us. If you think you have received Spam from Netster.com, 
			please read the following explanation of how an unrelated sender can make you believe you have 
			received Spam from us.  
			<br><br>
			Unfortunately, "spammers" routinely try to make you think that a third party has sent the offending 
			e-mail.  There are many ways spammers can do this to hide their true identity. 
			One such method is called "spoofing."  That is where they use a different e-mail address 
			than their own in the "from" line of the message. In order to find out the true origin of the 
			e-mail, try going to "View" followed by "Options" in your Microsoft Outlook and reading the 
			"Internet Headers."  Although not a fool-proof method, you can usually trace the true origin 
			of the Spam this way.  
			<br><br>
			In addition to "spoofing," spammers sometimes use a method called "URL switching" to hide their 
			true identity.  This method is particularly confusing as it requires a significant amount of technical 
			knowledge to get uncover the real source of the message.  We have found an interesting article that may 
			assist you in understanding this method, which you can access at 
			<a href="http://www.pc-help.org/obscure.htm ">http://www.pc-help.org/obscure.htm</a>
			<br><br>
			We operate a free, Web-based e-mail service to which anyone can subscribe.  
			Although we have a stringent anti-Spam policy that we attempt to enforce by use of
			sophisticated software supplemented by manual monitoring, occasionally a user finds a way to abuse 
			the system.  Such users are terminated immediately upon discovery.  If you believe that one of our 
			users is sending you Spam, please forward the entire "Spam" e-mail to us, and we will terminate any 
			user guilty of spamming.
			<br><br>
			Before you accuse anyone of spamming, please be sure to verify your suspicions before taking any 
			action that might itself be harmless to innocent parties.  If you contact other people and wrongly 
			accuse Netster.com of having sent you Spam, those false accusations are potentially harmful to us 
			and our business.  If done recklessly, the making of such false accusations can constitute unlawful 
			business libel and is akin to yelling "fire" in a crowded theatre - something we cannot and will 
			not tolerate.  Instead, we welcome your sincere inquiries and will do our best to resolve any 
			question or complaint we receive.  Please send us any offending Spam if you may receive.  
			As a courtesy to you, will try to show you how the Spam was sent from a party not connected to us. 
			If it appears that you have wrongly accused us of having sent Spam, we expect you to contact anyone 
			with whom you  may have shared that false accusation so that you may retract that statement.  
			<br><br>
			We are very much opposed to spamming, and do not engage in this practice. Some undesirable business people use fictitious 
			links and/or redirecting characters in the 'reply to' section of an offending e-mail to try and fool people that the 
			origin of the e-mail is different than it really is. We want to assure you that this is not us. Again, we do not spam, 
			PERIOD! If you have received a spam that you think we need to know about, please send it to <a href="mailto: technical@netster.com">technical@netster.com</a>, so we can try and track it down.
			<br><br>
