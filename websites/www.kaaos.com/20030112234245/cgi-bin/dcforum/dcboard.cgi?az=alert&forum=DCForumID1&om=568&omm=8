Well you are sucking cock Geo, why should he waste his time being intricate about it? Or maybe you want him to get into detail about your cock sucking, gives you good jerk off material.

I've witnessed your bitchness far too long to not throw in a comment. I hate arrogant cocks who think they're *good* at games. 

Most of the people good at these mindless pieces of shit are insecure shits who need some type of persona to feel all powerful about, compared to others in a massive enviorment, so they're willing to tolerate the fact the game sucks. Size hardly matters. A small group of elite can turn the tide of anything, just because you're in a MMORPG doesn't mean you have to have castles and a large roster to affect the outcome of things.  If you had a group of ten people, that ripped ass, communciated and trusted each other like brothers, while they may not overcome huge forces, they will at least make an impact. And an impact is the only thing you can ask for. The worse thing that could happen is a meaningless existance.  One such as your's, I assure you neither I, or anyone in KAAOS will remember you six months after you yap your last yap, though there are true legends I will probably remember until I'm fifty.
