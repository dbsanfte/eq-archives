         <blockquote>
         The flow of combat is extremely important, too slow (like chess) is boring for almost any modern day gamer. I suck at chess, but I'm sure that even I could push a grand master to 20 moves if I played it defensively enough. I'm with you when you say that healing slows the combat down too much. I don't mind seeing a heal or two in combat (especially group combat), but damaging for 100 hp, then healing for 200 hp is a problem. Heals should be used as a counter against someone who is trying to chip away at your HP. There is no way that heals should be a reasonable counter to someone who's going full out damage.<P>However, combat that is over in less than 5 moves is sucky as well. Strategic combat will take at least 10 moves. A good combat system can let one player win against a crappy player in 6-10 moves, but that should be the bottom. I don't neccessarily see any upper cap on the number of moves it takes to win. Some epic battle between the two best players might take over 100 moves to win. Assuming that every move was an important one, 100 moves to win would be a great combat system.<P>Luck sucks. Period. If you had no luck involved, I'd be happy. If you had just a small amount of luck, I'd be happy. When the entire game comes down to lucky rolls, I won't be happy. Use small ranges of numbers when determining to-hit and damage. That keeps things a little bit interesting and forces people to adjust to that unlucky roll.<P>__________________________________________________<P>1) Combat on the Map<P>This was a pretty big problem in DSO. Granted, it never had definable boundaries, which really sucked. However, even with a definable boundary, it will still suck rather badly.<P>2) Combat in a new Scene<P>NWN used this to good effect. NWN was a realtime game when it came to movement. However, NWN movement was done in what could be called a maze with defined squares. Each square had its own new scene that would pop up if combat was started on it. It becomes a lot different when you have a more open game without defined squares, which is pretty much required of games these days. I don't believe this would work very well.<P>3) Declared Combat<P>This is one of my old ideas. Basically, to start combat you declare combat on an opponent (usually done by starting an offensive attack on him). Combat is done on the map like normal, except in turn-based. The only way that other people get sucked in is if either they declare combat on someone in the combat or if someone in the combat declares combat on them. <P>__________________________________________________<P>1) True turn based<P>Everyone knows this. It has a couple drawbacks. It usually gives a slightly unfair advantage to whoever goes first because whoever goes 2nd will have to adjust to whatever was done before he even had a chance to do anything. The other drawback is time. True turn based is just painfully slow and it really needs to be.<P>2) Split turns between movement and action<P>This was done in the Warhammer series. It made things a little bit more fair. You want to move 2nd and attack first, but you can't do both. When you move 2nd, you can put yourself in the appropriate spot to smack your opponent or not let him smack you. Attacking 1st is an obvious advantage because you can potentially kill before they can attack back. It takes away the advantage of going first, however it slows down combat even more than normal turn based because there's a small downtime when transfering turns and there will be more turns with the movement turn followed by the attack turn.<P>3) Everyone takes a turn at the same time<P>Don't bother. Azmo is right on that one.<P>4) Charge based<P>I can see this working. Spend a point to move, or spend 5 to toss a fireball. Spend 2 points to swing your sword or 5 points to try knocking your opponents head off. It could work, but it would likely be turned aside by the masses just like every other turn-based system would.<P>5) Real time<P>Real-time combat CAN BE STRATEGIC. I believe it is also the only combat system that would be accepted by any reasonable quantity of players. In order to make it strategic, you need to really slow it down, slower than reality. That can also be a problem. Real life fighting is not really very strategic, it is mostly won by whoever is bigger, faster, and stronger. When you apply that to a video game where everyone is just as big, fast, and strong it is pretty pointless. Sure, some games can be fun in real-time, but twitch based combat isn't an option in a MMORPG. That means you would have to take a 'real-time' game and slow it down to slower than real-time in order to make it strategic. Will the masses accept that? I just don't know. If not, the masses will likely never find strategic combat again.<P>Mortarion<BR>god of death and decay
