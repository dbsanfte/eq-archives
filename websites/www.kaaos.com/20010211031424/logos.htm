              <p align="left">In the furthest parts of Dagaz's soul, darkness 
                as deep and muffling as black felt wrapped everything inside of 
                him. Only one sensation broke the nothingness. Somewhere in the 
                folds of his mind, a voice whispered… whispered… whispered…</p>
              <p align="left">What it whispered he could never tell. It droned 
                on deep within him, constantly rising and falling in volume, but 
                always below the level of understanding.</p>
              <p align="left">There were times when he wasn't sure in what world 
                he lived; the pleasant surroundings of the monastery or that complete 
                and utter blackness inside of him. He had written notes to the 
                Master about these experiences, and the Master had written back 
                that the whisperings were merely a reaction of the physical body 
                to the vow of silence that he had imposed on himself. The master 
                wrote that over time the body would quiet itself and submit fully 
                to his will. And so the monk did not worry much about the whispering. 
                But in the deepest moments of night, it seemed to get so loud. 
                So loud…</p>
              <p align="left">Still, no matter. His days were filled with the 
                deepest satisfactions. Even now as he tended the fields outside 
                the temple walls that fed his brethren he felt satiated on the 
                wholeness and goodness of life.</p>
              <p align="left">As the monk worked the soil, time passed and the 
                day waned late. The sun began to sink, becoming a dull red/orange 
                ball. It had just begun to touch the tips of the mountains far 
                in the distance. At the exact moment that the sun touched the 
                mountains, he caught the scent of charring and burning.</p>
              <p align="left">Dagaz closed his eyes for a moment, feeling as though 
                someone had just poured cold mountain water over his guts. Slowly 
                he raised his head and peered off in the direction of the simple 
                village that lay near their monastery. Ribbons of smoke coiled 
                over the village like a striking snake.</p>
              <p align="left">The ronin were back. In the days of the war with 
                the Shogazi the Emperor had recruited and trained many new Samurai. 
                And not all of them had met the standards of honor and family 
                normally imposed. That practice had spawned the ronin. Masterless 
                samurai who had turned to banditry once released from the Emperor's 
                service and had traveled far from the center of the empire, seeking 
                unprotected areas to operate freely in. And at this moment they 
                were burning the people he called friends. As he stood there his 
                jaw clenched, and images flashed before his mind of the screaming 
                villagers fleeing through the dirt packed street. Flames tore 
                at their clothing, and the remorseless ronin rode them down from 
                horse back, swinging their blades and cutting the people down.</p>
              <p align="left">The whispering grew louder, reaching up from within 
                him, and entwining itself around his mind. He stood paralyzed 
                for a moment, but the sound never resolved into words. Dagaz gave 
                a violent shake of his head, and sprinted off to the main temple 
                gate to sound the alarm bell. The smoke snakes coiled deeper as 
                he ran, and the screams of the people began to trickle across 
                the fields and into his ears.</p>
              <p align="left">As he entered the temple gate, he watched the other 
                monks slowly disperse, no words spoken, as was their vow. Each 
                went to find a spot to meditate, avoiding his desperate gaze. 
                Dagaz knew in a moment that they would not violate the purity 
                of their studies and the temple by attempting to interfere with 
                the outside world.</p>
              <p align="left">Dagaz did not find a spot to meditate. As he had 
                watched the monks, the whispering had grown louder. The world 
                was drowned out in the rising tide of whispers. When he next became 
                aware of his surroundings it was night and his feet were taking 
                him across the fields and towards the still burning village. He 
                shuddered in the cooling air, still confused about what he was 
                doing, but unwilling or unable to stop his feet.</p>
              <p align="left">His churning legs carried him into the village. 
                Passing the burned out hulks of former homes, and the occasional 
                mutilation, Dagaz made his way to the center. There the ronin 
                had assembled those of the villagers who remained, and the leader 
                spoke to them in harsh tones. From the safety of the shadows, 
                Dagaz heard him chastise the people for failing to have prepared 
                his "tax" for him.</p>
              <p align="left">Dagaz clutched his robes about him, shivering physically 
                and emotionally as he listened. As the ronin's words ended, he 
                raised one hand, and brought it down. Three men walked out of 
                a hut behind the leader each holding a woman.</p>
              <p align="left">These were the three most beautiful women from the 
                village. Their features were like finest china, their bodies were 
                curved and smooth like the waves of a river. But now their souls 
                were dead, torn from their bleeding vaginas. It was clear that 
                every man among the ronin had raped these women. Their skin once 
                shone with their innocence and perfection, their eyes sparkled 
                with happiness. Now those eyes stared out from bruised and swollen 
                faces like patches of mud in a swamp.</p>
              <p align="left">Dagaz was drawn from his hiding place and he stumbled 
                blindly towards the women. His soul cried out to comfort them. 
                Tears streamed down his face as he walked.</p>
              <p align="left">As he reached the front of the crowd, unaware of 
                how he was exposing himself, the lead ronin noticed. A sneer crossed 
                his face, and he reached out one hand and grabbed Dagaz by the 
                long and black top knot that grew from his otherwise shaven head. 
                Dagaz was oblivious. The ache in his soul from looking at the 
                ruination of these women drowned out everything else.</p>
              <p align="left">"Aaah, one of the monks has come to visit. The purity 
                of your temple too dry for you, wise one? I see by your top knot 
                that you were nobility before you became a monk. I will never 
                understand the rich," he said, laughing. Laughing. Laughing? This 
                pompous fat toad could laugh standing next to what he had done 
                to these women? Dagaz felt sick. He leaned over, and vomited on 
                the shoes of the lead ronin.</p>
              <p align="left">Anger filled the face of this man, and he jerked 
                Dagaz off his feet by his top knot and dragged him to the women. 
                He roared, "I see you would like to save these three, wouldn't 
                you, monk? Well, we shall see how far your philosophies carry 
                you. You may save them, monk." The ronin's teeth clenched together, 
                and his unshaven foul face jutted itself before Dagaz. "The price 
                is one finger for each life, monk. How is your compassion now, 
                monk? One finger for each life!"</p>
              <p align="left">In reply, Dagaz raised one hand, closing his thumb 
                and forefinger into a fist. He laid his other three across a rock. 
                The ronin's face filled fast and hard with a look of fire, and 
                he tore the sword from its sheath, with one motion slamming it 
                down across the extended fingers. Dagaz screamed hard, and the 
                whispering climbed up into his brain in a violent rush. He fainted.</p>
              <p align="left">The monk woke slowly. Smoke filled his lungs. Pain 
                filled his head. He was crusted in blood, and could barely move. 
                Minutes went by, but move he did. Slowly he sat up. Sitting on 
                the ground, his head bobbed and wove as he tried to steady the 
                world. He reached out with his right hand to rest himself on the 
                ground, but as his hand touched the soil, a pain as bright as 
                a red hot nail in a forge jabbed up his hand and his arm, into 
                his heart. The breath was slammed from his body by the flare of 
                pain. In that moment of pain, his head snapped up and his vision 
                snapped into crystal clarity.</p>
              <p align="left">That was when he first saw them. The three women. 
                They lay on the ground near him, each one with their necks almost 
                severed through. Their heads hung onto their bodies by mere shreds 
                of skin. Mouth agape, Dagaz raised his hand before his face and 
                stared at the missing fingers. That was when he noticed it. The 
                fingers had been jammed - obscenely - inside the women, one in 
                each, ragged bloody stumps hanging out of them.</p>
              <p align="left">Dagaz… Dagaz broke. Inside his head, it was an almost 
                audible snap as everything that Dagaz had known and felt and lived 
                for simply cracked like a twig before this sight and this pain. 
                A silence more profound than any explained by his vow rose up 
                around him like walls. The world stilled. It was not just he who 
                was soundless now. The world was robbed of its expression as well. 
                In this purest of silences, the whispering began to rise. This 
                time it rose higher than it ever had, for his mind was like an 
                empty vessel. Nothing of himself remained to hold back the whispering. 
                And in this purest of silences, for the first time, he began to 
                hear words. The monk's face held a small, humble, calm smile. 
                It was clear that where ever his mind was, it was not here.</p>
              <p align="left">The monk rose to his feet, all traces of pain or 
                disorientation gone. He walked to the burning flames that still 
                licked at some of the buildings, and with a beatific smile, slid 
                his three-stumped hand into the fire. It curled up around his 
                hand, crackling and popping as it scorched across the wounds. 
                Dagaz just smiled. And…</p>
              <p align="left">And… the whispering? Yes. The monk's lips were writhing 
                over some almost inaudible set of words. Those few alive to witness 
                it watched as the monk pulled his severed fingers from the corpses. 
                In a daze, the man threw each finger in the fire and let it boil 
                the flesh from them. When they were stripped clean, the monk reached 
                into the flames and removed the bones, laying each one on the 
                ground in front of him. His eyes were lost. His mind was lost. 
                Who could say what controlled him now? Nothing in his actions 
                looked like those of the man who had been. This was something 
                new. And always the whispering. The lips of this new man worked 
                over and over again through some bizarre set of mumbling.</p>
              <p align="left">The monk reached into the ashes of the flesh that 
                had burned off his fingers, and as his lips whispered, the single 
                remaining finger of his right hand, and his thumb sprinkled ashes 
                over each fingers' bones. Power was coursing into the man somehow, 
                and from him into the bones before him. Three flashes.</p>
              <p align="left">In the first flash, the longest finger became a 
                staff. The staff was bone white, but somehow, beneath the white 
                one could see what looked to be a blood red core. And the staff 
                seemed hungry.</p>
              <p align="left">In the second flash, the ring finger became a sword. 
                Its blade was crimson, and its hilt obsidian black. And the sword 
                seemed thirsty.</p>
              <p align="left">In the third flash, the smallest finger became a 
                throat collar. It shone of the purest gold. And the collar seemed 
                to vibrate.</p>
              <p align="left">The monk picked up and donned each item, never a 
                pause in the whispering.</p>
              <p align="left">Suddenly the whispering stopped. The monk rose to 
                his feet, gripping the staff with his one fingered hand and leaning 
                on it. His wild eyes fastened on the villagers for a moment. His 
                hand reached out and grabbed the blade, and he finished the slaughter 
                of the villagers that the ronin had begun. Then he turned and 
                strode off.</p>
              <p align="left">Late that night, this… thing that had been Dagaz 
                caught up with the ronin. The carnage was complete. Each of the 
                dark Samaurai died beneath his blade. The screams that arced from 
                their bodies as the black-handled crimson katana pierced them 
                were unnatural. One with knowledge would recognize the sound of 
                souls being torn from bodies. The scene was bizarre as this monk 
                with the gentle face tore through the ronin, whispering the whole 
                way.</p>
              <p align="left">As each died, the monk would slam the butt of his 
                staff hard through their chests and into their hearts. The bodies 
                would feed into staff. With each death, the monk seemed to become 
                more powerful. The forces fed into him, filling his own body with 
                life, leaving no trace of the body that had been, except in each 
                case leaving 3 fingers lying on the ground. No counterpart now 
                existed in the monk's body for those to absorb into.</p>
              <p align="left">Finally the monk reached the lead ronin, and he 
                smiled as they faced each other. The ronin knew he would die. 
                "Monk. What are you before you kill me?"</p>
              <p align="left">The monk smiled, and broke from a whisper into speech, 
                truly breaking his old vow for the first time in twenty years. 
                "I am what was Dagaz. I am here to whisper into your soul the 
                words that I have learned from deep within me. I am here to spread 
                the comfort of the truth, ronin. You have brought from the black 
                tar of my innermost self the truth. Do you want to hear it?" Somehow 
                the expression on the monk's face was kind and caring, like a 
                parent comforting a child. But with that last question… when he 
                asked "do you want to hear it?" there was a change.</p>
              <p align="left">Suddenly, with no warning the monk was screaming.</p>
              <p align="left">"DO YOU WANT TO HEAR IT YOU PATHETIC MORTAL?! DO 
                YOU WANT TO HEAR THE TRUTH?! THEN I WILL GIVE IT TO YOU, ALL OF 
                IT!"</p>
              <p align="left">The monk's blade lanced outward and was buried hilt 
                deep in the bone of the ronin's forehead. The ronin screamed a 
                horrible, turgid scream.</p>
              <p align="left">Just as the scream started to fade, the monk leaned 
                forward and whispered to the ronin, noticing as he did that a 
                tear rolled down the evil man's face. With his single fingered 
                hand, he wiped it away.</p>
              <p align="left">"I am not the endless babbling that rolls from mens' 
                mouths. I am not the echo in your heads of your own thoughts. 
                I am not the chattering chattering chattering." The monk's face 
                was gleeful and satisfied looking as he spoke. Such a strange 
                contrast, this gentle faced monk happily explaining things to 
                a man with a sword buried hilt deep in his forehead.</p>
              <p align="left">"I am Logos, the true spoken word. Listen for it, 
                ronin. Listen within yourself. Now at the moment of your death, 
                do you hear the true spoken word?" The ronin's eyes widened as 
                he listened and heard.</p>
              <p align="left">"A power beyond your comprehension lives in the 
                spoken words of the abyss, ronin. And the spoken word is this. 
                There is no life. There is no death. There is only the spoken 
                word. So do not cry, sad man. What you think you are losing was 
                never yours. It never existed."</p>
              <p align="left">This thing named Logos screamed out the last of 
                these words, and the golden collar that he wore that was once 
                a finger, which had slowly been amplifying his words as they'd 
                grown louder and stronger ended by echoing these words like thunder. 
                They rolled off the mountains. "IT WAS ALWAYS MINE! LOGOS!" bounced 
                again and again across the valley.</p>
              <p align="left">With a convulsion, the monk reared back with the 
                staff and impaled the ronin through the heart, absorbing his body 
                into the bone staff, leaving only three fingers from his right 
                hand.</p>
              <p align="left">The monk chuckled, and set about the field of battle 
                gathering fingers into the folds of his robe. It was a gruesome 
                sight.</p></td>
