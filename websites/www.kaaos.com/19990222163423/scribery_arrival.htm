        <blockquote>
          <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>THE ARRIVAL</b></font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Sitting upon 
            a large grey stone, an old man looked down at the mass of children, 
            who has gathered around him, who had come to hear one of his tales. 
            A long, knotted grey beard hung down passed the wrinkled skin of his 
            throat, the only hair that could be seen on his head. The old man's 
            eyes could barely be seen behind the thick lenses of his glasses, 
            glasses which lay in the shadows cast by the wide brimmed hat he was 
            wearing. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">With the slowest 
            and most subtle of movements, the old man's frail hands opened the 
            cover of a weathered tome. The children murmured amongst themselves, 
            but one glance from the old man silenced them. As the old man began 
            to tell his story, a story of woe and sorrow, of pain and anguish, 
            the sky above them began to cloud over with dark clouds and the ominous 
            sound of thunder could be heard off in the distance.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> With a storm 
            brewing around them, the old man continued his tale, and the children 
            listened with rapt attention, and more than a couple of them bit their 
            lips as shivers were sent through their bodies from the old man's 
            words. Nodding to himself before continuing, the old man recounted 
            the scariest story he could think of while beads of sweat began to 
            appear on his leathery brow. For, this story brought fear to all, 
            the old, the young, the strong, the weak. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">All feared the 
            horrid tales of KAAOS. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The old man paused 
            in mid verse, leaving the children to their own thoughts as he remembered 
            the tales he, himself, had heard when he was a child. Many thought 
            that these stories were just used to put a scare in children, but 
            the old man knew better. His fingers unconsciously let go of the tome 
            he had held in his hands and they moved to his cheek, tracing a long 
            purple scar which had been concealed in shadow. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">As his fingers 
            touched the scar, he heard his father's words echoing in his head 
            and in front of him, he no longer saw the massed children, but instead 
            he saw himself sitting before his father as his father recounted this 
            same tale. He listened now as if he had never heard this story before. 
            </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The old man listened 
            to his father telling of how the forces which he called KAAOS had 
            once existed in some far off realm. KAAOS, as they called themselves, 
            was a band of the most twisted and warped that any had ever come in 
            contact with, their power being so strong that they were seen as gods 
            and worshipped as them, as well, his father explained to him in the 
            flashback. When they had broken the spirit of those who had lived 
            in that far off realm, KAAOS and a lesser faction began to struggle 
            for control. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The one faction 
            wished to move on, to continue the way of bloodshed and domination 
            against new peoples instead of staying among the spineless. The other 
            faction wished to stay in the same realm where the people lay cowering 
            already. The forces of KAAOS, having made their decision, left the 
            realm of the weak and moved on to new lands where a challenge existed. 
            The leader, one named Malhavok, had brought the most evil and most 
            vile lot with him, leaving the other faction and its weaker members 
            to go their own way. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Thus, KAAOS was 
            born anew, as the movement ended up in the elders cleaning house and 
            weeding out of the weaker members who didnt have the heart. The other 
            faction, chuckled the father as he spoke to his son, became a ragtag 
            band of the slow of wit and weak of soul, who some have heard of as 
            The Mercs. They always strived their hardest to be like their rival 
            guild KAAOS, but they lacked the strength or the wit to survive such 
            a task, and thus they sank into near anonimity. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">His father continued 
            to tell the story, his smile gone from his lips now. While the mercs 
            were always stuck in their own private cesspool of mediocrity, KAAOS 
            flourished. Whereever they went, rivers of blood flowed under their 
            feet. Those who stood before them were crushed and broken, there souls 
            damned to eternal torment at the hands of these Gods of KAAOS. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Then that fateful 
            day came, when the realm that they had conquered was thrown so far 
            into anarchy and chaos, that all of the people were either slain or 
            forced to flee. Thus, that realm ceased to exist and KAAOS was forced 
            to find a new home. A tear began to fall from the corner of the father's 
            eye as he talked to his son. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">"My son," he 
            said, "KAAOS has come here. None of these lands are safe. Even Lord 
            British and his followers are no match for them. We now enter into 
            a dark time.. a time of pain. A time of fear. A time of death." The 
            old man was suddenly awoken from his flashback as a child shook his 
            hand violently. The old man tried to speak, tried to form a reply, 
            but all he could do was gasp for breath and clutch his chest. As he 
            fought against the clawing hand of death, his body began to shake 
            in fear as visions of these dark clad Gods of KAAOS shot through his 
            head.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> Then abruptly, 
            he fell backwards, sprawled on his back ontop of the rock which he 
            had once sat upon. The book fell to the ground with a dull thud and 
            at that instant lightning flashed across the sky and the storm came. 
            Rain and hail began to pummel the earth, causing the children to flee 
            back to their homes, but no child would ever be the same. No child 
            could ever be the same after listening to the story of the old man 
            and after seeing the utter look of terror and anguish that was written 
            upon his face as his life and soul were taken from his body. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Even as the children 
            were running from the storm's destructive power, a new sound could 
            be heard by those who listened. Amidst the thunder and confusion, 
            a low, amused laughter could be heard.. and everyone who heard it 
            knew where it was coming from. As fear swept through the people, the 
            Gods of KAAOS laughed. KAAOS had finally arrived.</font></p>
