<H1>UO - Max Times</H1>

<p>People form communities and role play, and interact as a rule much more AFTER they have maxxed their characters.

<p>When people are not as strong as they can be, they tend to play the game with a focus towards getting better, rather than towards enjoying adventures or conflicts.  They don't stop to talk, they don't hang around, they don't form groups, and they don't take on bigger challenges when there's an alternative of becoming more powerful first by taking on lots of the little challenges.  From a survival perspective it would be stupid to do otherwise.

<p>Now before you go telling me this, I KNOW that it would be more fun if they just played the game instead of waiting till they could be master of the universe to play seriously, but people just don't think that way in general.

<p>If OSI understood this then they would make a world where a good 40 to 50% of it was dedicated to remaining challenging even to maxxed characters, and they would make it much easier than it is now to get maxxed.  The challenges in the game for maxxed characters would require that people be better at using the combat engine and game mechanics to win, rather than simply getting those few extra STR points.

<p>That would significantly speed the formation of societies, cooperative play, COMPETITIVE PVP instead of PKing of the helpless, etc. etc. etc.
