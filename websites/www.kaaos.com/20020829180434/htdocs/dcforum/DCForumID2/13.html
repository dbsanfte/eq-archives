         <blockquote>
           Torm Tar’varas was parched.<P>  Speckles pranced in front of his eyes as he shook away the cobwebs of mead cloying his brain. As sunlight spilled through a shabby, filthy window in the corner, he felt his bare back fitting against a hard, unfamiliar mattress. The sounds of a marketplace beginning its daily hawkings echoed from the earth below the opening. And even though he had never seen the room with his own eyes before, he inwardly knew what type of establishment he was in. <i>Here we go again,</i> Tar’varas sighed to himself. <i>As usual, the prince of Khal’Dustyun manages to spread the fruit of his loins to a whore.</i> <P>  The coming morning left few options. But as he stretched his arm over the smooth, chilled back of the girl beside him, nervous pinpricks danced over his skin. He instantly retracted his hand, staring at the black crusted blood that coated his palm and trickled down his wrist. Small gobbets of flesh, entrenched in his fingernails, dictated what he would see as soon as he turned the dead woman over.<P>  The blonde-haired, deeply attractive girl’s throat was ripped from ear to ear, tendrils of her gentle skin flapping in lithe gusts of wind from the window, her windpipe filled with a scream that would never escape her now deathly blue lips. A trail of blood still feebly fell from the rent veins in the horrid encrusted gap that had once been a neck. And a simple look at the tell-tale marks on Tar'varas’ hand told the story of the night before: a man who had never performed physical work in his entire pampered life had ripped the life from the flimsy flesh beneath him.<P>  Thoughts slammed into the sides of his mind, rushing at him with cruel alacrity. One means of escape presented itself immediately, the window. Yet this was only temporary. Doubtless, his compatriots and the house mistress had seen (and provided for, damn them all) his stumble up the rough-hewn stairs into the whore’s room. This left only one deeply troubling option.<P>  The corpse had to come with him.<P>  Tar’varas threw himself off of the bed and clothed himself, the finest of Khar’Duyun’s tailortry. <i>Fine wear for a murderer,</i> he thought. Grimly, he gathered the sheets and the corpse together, making one huge bloodied bundle. He hefted it onto his shoulder and peered out the window into the street below. The market was not yet in full trade, it would be possible for even a dandy such as he to escape unnoticed into the back alleys of the capital city of Trarsithoon. <P>  <i>A ten foot drop,</i> he thought. <i>Far enough to break bones, without some sort of padding.</i><P>  He looked at the bundled corpse.<P>  <i>I’m already a killer. A desecrator can’t be much worse.</i><P>  The body hit the ground with a crackling thud, soon followed by a pained grunt as Tar’Varas’s form hit the bundle and rolled to the side. Wincing, he attempted to regain his breath, crawling over to the mass of sheets. He hefted them onto his shoulder and jogged limping down the dark, ever narrowing streets of Trarsithoon. <BR>

         	The body only made a small splash as it hit the sewer’s gushing, dank waters.<P>	<i>Nobody misses a whore,</i> Tar’varas thought, trying to justify, trying to console himself. It was only in those moments of self-loathe that he noticed his hands again. The blood had smoothed itself, coating his hands and seeping onto his wrists, stopping just short of his forearm. It had slowly began warming until it was again the same temperature of his own blood, horrifying him with its hot stickiness. With equal amounts of terror and intrigue, he brushed his hand upon the ground. The blood neither left his hand or a mark on the ground, simply remaining, a maligant heat upon his limb. <P>	The future became a quickly shortening tunnel for Tar’varas.<P>	Blinking in disbelief, he slumped against the dank wall and tried to stem the tears stinging his eyes. He withdrew his never-used dagger with one burning hand.<P>	The glint of the dagger threw phantom lights across the moss-covered stone in the alley, the edge tapering to a expertly forged point. This last detail was important to Tar’varas: if his suicide could not be painless, he wished it to be quick.<P>	Trembling, he raised the point to the albin neck that only yesterday had been graced with the finest powders in the Thirdland. That only yesterday had felt the faerun kisses of no less than ten ladies. That only yesterday had the perfume of the Jai’tananess of King Ghaerdol course its lines.<P>	Those yesterdays became a blot of pain as the point was drawn across his neck, his blood intermingling with the whore’s, the stones of the alleys becoming his only vision.<P>	When he next saw those stones, he would sorely wish that he hadn’t.<BR>

                 Death’s a funny thing.<P>	It can be cheated, avoided, and delayed. But never, ever, can it be defeated.<P>	That’s why the unconscious form on the dimly lit, stained wooden table in front of him was such an enigma to Paryon. In fact, this corpse that should have been was nearly scalding hot, his impending death seemingly creating an inner inferno. All logic had been defied.<P>	The finely honed knife had correctly incised the jugular.<P>	The three rusted, filthy buckets beside the table catching the overflowing gore had been emptied and refilled twice.<P>	The eyes were dilated. The limbs were stiff. And yet…<P>	It continued to breathe.<P>	Most curious were the hands, coated with a strange substance that was at first glance simply more of the blood cascading off of the table, but on second consideration was too dark… too… <i>malevolent</i>.<P>	The chirurgeon’s  begloved hands started to rip open the blood-caked purple silk shirt to prepare for surgery, but stopped short. <i>Why should I?</i> Paryon thought. <i>He’s doing a better job healing himself than I ever could.</i><P>	Indeed, nearly before his eyes, the folds of flesh were smoothing, slowly mending. The veins had already regenerated, and the flow of blood was gradually coming to a halt. Mesmerized by the sight, Paryon merely motioned for his serving boy to empty the buckets, refusing to look away from the near-miracle occurring before his eyes.<P>	So mesmerized, in fact, that he failed to see the muscles in the arms and legs slowly begin to relax<BR>

         <blockquote>
         	The serving boy scrubbed out the first of the buckets into the sewer causeway that ran down to the river coursing through the urban heart of Trarsithoon. He threw the useless, blood-saturated rag into the river and started back into the hovel that his master called a ‘haven for the poor,’ whatever that was supposed to mean.<P>	But something caught his eye.<P>	At the end of the causeway, the red rag brushed a white sheet snagged by the bars of the floodgate, both of which sent trails of blood spiralling down the waters’ path. Curiosity besting him, the boy went over to the sheet and peered closer at the wafting edges. His perception was rewarded when a corner fell back and a head rolled out of the bundle, obviously torn from its body only moments earlier by the rushing waters. Paralyzed with terror, the boy watched as the blonde-haired, pale orb barrelled down the causeway and fell into the darkness below on its exodus to the river.<P>	Then the boy heard the screams.<P>	From inside the ‘clinic,’ a pair of screams, one of utter rage, the other of stark terror, intermingled with one another in a cacophony of hate. Rushing inside, the boy bleached in horror at the sight of the silhouettes the torchlight cast against the opposite wall. The bloodied form the boy had found and figured for dead no less than twenty minutes before in one of the labyrynthal alleys had now seized a shadow that could only be his master by the head. Racing to a corner, tightening into a ball, morbid curiosity forced his eyes open as watched the shadow drama unfolding. <P>The form raised a dagger and slit a circle around his master’s head. <P>To even greater yowls of agony, the form plunged its hand, like ebon talons, into Paryon’s face and eyes, straining for purchase on the aged cliff of a head.<P>Even in his most vile, grim nightmares, the boy had never imagined the sound of a skull being torn in twain. Silent, blank eyes witnessed as the old chirurgeon’s face was gradually twisted off of the remainder of his skull, finally releasing with a half pop, half cracking sound.<P>The shadow drama became reality when the form tossed old man’s body to the ground in front of the serving boy, still hidden behind the myriad boxes he kept for his patients. <P>He saw him struggling to breathe with no mouth left to do so, his windpipe slowly clogging with gore and mucus from the now open sinus cavities.<P>He saw his hands clutch for a nose that was no longer there, instead feeling the raw surface of his own brain, a sensation never meant to be felt by a human hand.<P> He saw the bubbles of blood welling up in the exposed throat, until a few moments later, they simply collapsed.<P>The body’s jerkings ceased a moment later, settling into death’s clutches.<P>And over all the silent din of watching the mutilation of the only person of worth to the boy, cackling laughter rang through the building. Cackling that continued as the deranged form leaped around the corner and stared at the boy.<P>“I knew you were there all the time,” it said with a lopsided grin.<P>The boy, scared into shock, merely stared ahead impassively.<P>“Why aren’t you laughing?” it said with a mock frown, blood pouring from its hands over his finely leathered trousers and black scuffed boots. <P>“Don’t you think this is funny?”<P>It held up his master’s face above its own carnally drenched one in a gruesome masquerade., Grinning, laughing, cavorting around the dusty, dimly room, it pranced over to the now still body of Paryon. Straddling it, the form poked at the brain, watching its finger go in and out of the grey mass, and finally dipping out a fingerful and tasting it daintily. He pulled out another fingerful and proffered it to the quivering, catatonic serving boy.<P>“Go ahead. It’s like a fine, vintage wine,” it said.<P>The cackling grew to massive guffaws, and its source bounded out the door, his laughter echoing off the dark abandoned buildings lining his path to hell.<BR>

The remainder felt the cold, moist chill of a spring’s night in Trarsithoon.<P>	One part of the remainder was his left eye, which looked out over the same stones he had seen when his neck was drawn in two by the edge of his dagger.<P>	One part of the majority was his right eye, which saw the world in a myriad of warm and cold tones, all overcast in a mist of white. <P>       One of the warm ones included his right arm, outstretched from his sprawl across the walkway, And in the hand attached to that arm...<P>	<i>Oh no.</i><P>	As his left eye fixed in horror upon the dismembered face of someone he’d never seen, his left leg felt the deep jab of what could only be a surgeon’s scalpel.<P>	Drunk with confusion and fear, he didn’t see its source until he felt the jab the third time. A small boy, no older than eight or nine, was doing his best to separate his leg from his body, with little success. Tears flooded his face as he let loose a pitiful war cry against his nemesis limb. His cries did no good as the wounds closed as quickly as he created the three inch incisions.<P>	Instinct took over as Tar’varas felt his hand, now oddly heavier than it was before, rear back and backhand the boy. The strike sent his small frame spilling across the alley. Knocked out by the force of the blow, the boy’s hand unfolded, sending the scalpel clattering softly down the path.<P>	Tar’varas stood, mortified by his reaction, and began to walk over to the boy. He never made it, as the disorientation from two completely different visions skewed his path, and he was sent tumbling into boxes. And despite not knowing why his hand had talons on it, or why his body sizzled with mercurial heat, or why his eye refused to see reality, he laughed. He laughed at the comedy of his hand holding a mask of an old dead man, of a boy trying to slay him with a scalpel, of whoever would have placed a well-faked corpse in his room at the local brothel. <P>	He laughed at the unfolding reality before him, just because he didn’t like it, and nobody was around to stop him.<BR>

Oh, it was possible, of course, that he would see her again. She wasn’t dead physically, he knew. But the moment she broached his doors, she ceased to exist in Kun’Scha’s eyes.<P>	Then why, he asked himself, did he hold this simple jewelwork before his eyes every night before he went to bed?<P>	Sighing with discontent, he went over to the cupboard and extracted one of his vials, this one for sleeping. The practice of alchemy had its blessings, Kun’Scha thought, but most of them are for the more mundane tasks. He slowly sloshed the green fluid inside, creating a mildly hypnotic effect. He soon shrugged the momentary reverie off.<P>	<i>Ironic how the most mundane blessings are the most profitable. </i><P>He then cast a look over the rest of his distilled collection, including some of the most potent mixtures in the Thirdland. A small smile crept across his face at the sight of the results of his life’s work.<P> <i>But only the unusual can captivate… or kill… or transform.</i><P>	After swilling the contents of his makeshift sleeping potion, Kun’Scha rolled into bed and lay under the richly embroidered comforter, waiting for sleep to whisk him into its arms. But this night, as every night, he wondered what his ex-wife saw in that other man. After all, he did nothing but own a brothel.<BR>					*************<P>	<i>Damn Gar Kun’Scha. Damn him and all his little deviant dealings.</i><P>	Alcohol assauged Urs Partok’s pain at losing perhaps his finest whore, and maybe a bit of a lover, he admitted to himself. But his anger refused to drift away into a mug of ale.<P>	<i>To the abyss with the dragon-buggerer’s concoctions! I told her not to use that stuff she took from him that she said would keep her from getting knocked up. And now, she’s gone off missing, blood all over the place. With my luck, that stuff she put up her hemorraged, and that damn dandy probably panicked and did who-knows-what with her. But no… she was always right, wasn't she?</i><P>Partok took another swig and cursed softly. The longer he dwelled in his cups, the more he realized that she never cared about him, just his long john. <P>	<i>Well, at least that’s one area that I’ve got Kun’Scha beat in spades.</i> He snickered to himself. But it was small consolation as the event had spooked half the rest of his whores into not showing up the rest of the week. <P><i>-end interlude-</i><BR>

The voice sounded oddly familiar, but noone but him and the unconscious boy were in the access alley.<P>	<b><i>It’s over.<P>	You have lost.<P>	Give in.</b></i><P>	Slowly, his body, but not his mind, worked its way free of the debris that he had fallen into. Tar’varas stood mute witness, his psyche beating on the walls of a body that no longer listened. Yet there was one thing holding him back. His entire psyche was not there.<P>	<b><i>That’s right. The boy has what you need to finish Myself. It’s what I and you have always wanted, but you have simply been too proud to admit it. Weakling.</b></i><P>	<i>I’m not a weakling!</i> Tar’varas fired back at his unseen, unfelt assailant. <i>Go back to where you came from! </i><P>	And then the laughter came again, his vocal cords rebelling against his voice. Belly laughs convulsed his body, in a tone never heard before from the mouth of Torm Tar’varas. The laughing continued as his body continued its inexorable march toward the boy.<P>	His hand, now little more than a claw, slowly wrapped around the boy’s neck, shaking him to his senses. The myopic vision of Tar’varas watched as the boy’s eyes slowly opened, no longer surprised by anything he saw. Shock had taken him completely. <P><b><i>The will to live is extinguished. He is more than willing to give what I need.</b></i><P>	The other hand raised back, preparing to take the last vestige of life from the exhausted child.<P>	<i>NO!</i><P>	<i><b>Why? You know that I need it. You know what I and you are now. Perhaps you don’t remember why I am here in the first place…</i></b><P>	A barrage of thoughts careened into Tar’varas, memories of the bloodshed when he was beaten by his father for not being good enough, for not being able to weave magic, for not being able to swing a sword. Memories of the bloodshed when his brother “accidentally” slid his sword through Tar’varas’ arm in swordplay. Memories of the bloodshed when his mother, locked in the dungeons deep beneath the palace, required drink that the king would not give her.<P><b><i>	You always wanted to fight them, didn’t you? You always wanted them to be punished, didn’t you? And I did it, every night, in your mind. And now, I can do it in a very, very real sense.</b></i><P>	The realities he had been trying to shut out for so long finally erupted to the surface of his mind, overwhelming him with their suddenness. So he did not protest when his hand plunged deep into the boy’s chest, splitting his rib cage in twain, white shards of his sternum jutting from the wreckage of his torso. He did not protest when the first blood rained over his head, changing the remainder of his original features as it coursed down over them. He did not protest as the refuse that was formerly human life was tossed down the alley, collapsing in a small, misshapen heap.<P>	And when the black, bloodstreaked troll slid into the darkness on its way to the palace, he even realized that he had enjoyed it.<BR>
