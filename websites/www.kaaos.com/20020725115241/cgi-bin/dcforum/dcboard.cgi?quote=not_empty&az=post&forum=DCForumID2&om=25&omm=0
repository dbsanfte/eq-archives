         <BR>As often happens in the lands, this night was another of foreboding weather, not unlike any other night in the past month. The black sky, pinpricked with points of light shedding what light they could upon the surface of the world, was overcast early with dark, rolling clouds that surely brought rain for the next week. Were it not for these clouds, anyone looking up to the slight gibbous moon waning in the sky might have seen the silhouettes of unbeknownst creatures flitt across the face of the now hidden ornament of the night sky.<P>  All the little creatures of the night were out and about, making their noises, it was never truly quiet in the country of the land. Noises that were natural, but never noticed. The insects shuffling about their business, snakes looking for some easy prey, a cat climbing up a tree to settle down to sleep for the night.<P>  Something could be seen in the distance, and all the noises stopped. It was an unnatural silence, an uneasiness of something that didn't belong.<P>  A figure walking through a field. Could it be him? Is this what is responsible? What might the creatures of the night fear, or know, about this person that kept them so silent at this, the zenith of their activity?<P>  Without an answer, or a question of it's own, the figure came upon an old gnarled tree. The blackened bark of this ancient piece of the landscape was rarely home to anything other than one of the many fungi that plagued the wilderness in damp. Scorch marks from numerous lightning strikes scored the trunk as if someone was keeping tally of the destruction come to this place. The figure sat down on a large outgrown root, but the storm soon forced any would-be observers into shelter.<P><BR>Feel free to add something if ya like<P><BR>The Anvil
