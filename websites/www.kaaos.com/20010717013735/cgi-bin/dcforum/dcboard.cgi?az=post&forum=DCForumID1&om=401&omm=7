         <blockquote>
         "For the record, the "rough crowd" I run with is ONLINE. The people I come into contact with do not feel the need to be polite or maintain manners - use yourself as an example."<P>I suppose the term 'rough crowd' means different things to different people.  If you think a group of mannerless drooling idiots that have learned how to say "I roxxer joo!" constitutes a rough crowd then who am I to argue with you?<P>You know what you remind me of?  You ever see that old Clint Eastwood flick called "Every Which Way But Loose?"  In it there's a gang of bikers who are so pathetic that when they get pulled over by the cops, the officer is laughing too hard to give them tickets.  They start jumping up and down saying "We are evil!  We demand our tickets!  We are badasses! We are rough and tough and we demand you take us in and jail us like the criminals we are!"  You and the Mercs so remind me of that.  "We are SO evil!  We will prove it! We are a rough crowd!  We can cuss and stuff and we have no manners!"<P>You are so mannerless that when I accuse you of being heartless to Ego you go apologize.  Anyone in Kaaos would have said "So?  I'm a bitch.  No shit Sherlock -- I'm in Kaaos.  Your point?"  But no, you run to apologize for being heartless and then the next moment post about how tough you are.  And when I call you on your bullshit you defend it.  Right.  Whatever.  OK sistah -- you win.  You run with a rough crowd.  I concede.  I am scared.  You slay me man.<P>"I don't know what kind of excuses you've fed yourself for your post on the Lum board, well actually I do, they're all right there. "She deserves it", why?"<P>I never said that.  As a matter of fact I said the exact opposite.  Reading comprehension.  Its tough, I know, but if you apply yourself I'm sure that even you can figure out what the little words mean.  YOU are the one that said you deserved the humiliation.  Let me quote from your post: "I deserve to be killed in a game because I cannot defend myself, and I deserve to be called a moron on a board because I called somebody else a stupid asshole. I deserve to have my website and my memories mocked because I made it public, and I run with a real rough crowd."  See how right there you said you deserved to be mocked?  <BR> <BR>"Because umm.... Oh yes, because I thought Ego was using the message board to play a game."<P>Well see, this goes to the heart of the fundamental difference between a bunch of loosers like the Mercs and the guys in Kaaos.  The idiots you hang out with think its funny to say they've died or have some sort of serious illness in real life when they don't and they do it often enough that when ANYONE does it you automatically assume they are being a looser like yourself.  The people in Kaaos don't do shit like that.  They don't need to.  They really are very good at what they do and don't need to feign death and illness to get attention.  The Mercs, on the other hand, emulate festering piles of shit in the hope that they will, at the very least, attract some flies -- that being better than the loneliness they are used to.  <P>"And because Mercs messed up an ONLINE wedding? I have no knowledge of them doing this recently, I recall the Mercs of old descending upon a host in Yserbius where a wedding was taking place and challenging all the guests. When the Mercs hosted a "fight night" in AC they were prepared for people that would want to disrupt the event, they had high level power people on guard at all points to stop the intruders - while not the point of this post perhaps you might want to pass that suggestion on to other ONLINE brides and grooms."<P>Again, let me quote your post.  Consistency is good in fantasy and roleplay.  Also in lying.  You should make note of this.  In any case in your first post you spewed: "So Delusion, who admitted that he knew nothing at all about the Mercs, is quite wrong in thinking they are not roleplayers. They roleplay chaos and evil. They disrupt ONLINE weddings because they are CHAOTIC AND EVIL."  <P>"My first impression from your post is that you really need to take some time off the computer. There is absolutely no distinction in your mind between real life and ONLINE. How unfortunate."<P>Whatever.  You know nothing about me, nothing about my private life, and I, at least, can tell the difference between bullshit and when someone actually does have a scary as all fuck virus.  <P>"I haven't been "humiliated" by any of this."<P>Good for you.  Here's something to chew on shit-for-brains: Either you really are a malicious, unfeeling, souless bitch or you really are/were too stupid to tell Ego was telling the truth. I am going with the latter myself.  I think you are also too stupid to figure out when you've been humiliated.  Or when you've humiliated yourself.  But again, whatever.  Enjoy your illusions if that is what you have to enjoy.<P>"Its really hard for me to get worked up because somebody thinks I missed a time period by 100 years, or because somebody else they're just too cool to have fun my way."<P>Huh?  What field did that come out and why?  <P>"What I SAID was that if I make a move to put something public, and then I tell people about it within that "rough crowd" (aka lacking in restraint and etiquette) then I really have nobody at all to blame but myself for the fall out."<P>No.  What you said was that you deserved to be mocked. See the quote above.<P>"Yes, I DESERVE to have to listen to people like you bellowing about ONLINE weddings and what some group of people that have NOTHING to do with my reality did at some ONLINE wedding."<P>Again, huh?  I made one small post about how you were a hypocrite because you and your guild disrupt roleplay events online but that you have them in real life.  I'm not sure what this has to do with the above statement.  <P>"Since you have shown no ability to seperate my reality from your fantasy I forgive you your childish words."<P>Trust me, you are not in my fantasies.  A fact that I shall forever be grateful for.<P>"Maybe online is all you've got, maybe is where you're best. I use online to supplement my leisure time, not give meaning to my life. "<P>Yay you.  <P>"Be strong. Be happy."<P>Same to ya. <BR> <BR>Myschyf<BR><a href="http://www.lumthemad.net" target="_blank">http://www.lumthemad.net</a><P>P.S.  I went to my first medieval style wedding in the late 70s.  In real life my friends are an odd assortment of techies, actors, larpers and reenactors.  These type of weddings have grown considerably more common since then.  'Roleplay' or 'Period' weddings are extremely common.  These would be weddings that are, in fact, real, but the participants and guests come dressed in a period costume.  The fact that you had a medieval dress wedding does not make you individualistic.  Trust me on this one. Now if you had done something a little less common that might have impressed me.  This past weekend one of my friends that does reenactments went to a WWI wedding.  Now THAT was cool.  They did a small battle reenactment for the guests too.  <P>China your wedding idea is/was fine.  Stop defending it.  It was your wedding and you can do what you goddam well please at your wedding.  If you want to have a wedding where everyone gets naked and prances around a mulberry bush well then you can do that and I wouldn't mock you for it.  I'm mocking you for being a hypocrite and an idiot and it has very little to do with your actual wedding.<P>
