         <b><i>“The whole reason for my initial disgust with KAAOS was based soley on a passed up opportunity at PvP that was laid right at your feet. Granted, you may have seen it differently then I because you werent outside among the newts and I was.”</b></i><P>There are things that need to be done to be and stay competitive. You must remain focused and you must remain dedicated. That particular fight was in an entirely different zone with no KAAOSers involved. We don’t care about anybody but our own. If the Nuets were in our way we would have driven a stake through their hearts. As it was, a “fight” in West Commons did not affect us. This game is fraught with waste and you must recognize it and strive to minimize it. We will not deviate, we will not distract, from our agenda simply to run around chasing every newb in the game. There’s more to being a PvPer than throwing your balls at every swinging dick. If we distract simply to kill some no-name from some no-name guild every time we log on then our levels would be similar to those in your guild and the other PvP guilds will make it their agenda to shove our faces in a pile of shit of our own making. <BR>	<BR><b><i>“Since then ive watched KAAOS and HoW (TCE) climb their way onto the boards.”</b></i><P>We are still leveling, any score we’ve had to this point is from what I would gauge a 10% effort. This isn’t just in our case, this is the case of all the guilds that take PvP seriously. PvP is light right now from the top guilds compared to where it will be when we all finish taking care of business. In a few more weeks you will see the shit really hit the fan.<P><b><i>“You guys simply have a completely different mind set going into this server than I do. You are there to dominate as much as humanly possible in a game that was never truly ment for PvP. Thats fine, if you want to dominate EQ be my guest, it seems be your guilds objective in any game you tackle.”</b></i><P>That’s exactly right, it is our objective to dominate every game we tackle. Every move you make in every game reflects on your guild. A guild does not survive for 9 years by being a punching bag. If you think that means we like to pick on the weak then you still have a lot to learn. Any idiot can kill a lame duck. It means nothing to us. We look for the challenge and we rise to the occasion. Defeating an evenly matched foe time after time after time after year after year after year after game after game after game proves dominance.<P>Existing to pick on the helpless is not dominating, it’s for the weak, as is consistently “playing the underdog”. People who want to play the underdog need excuses for their inadequacies. A victory here or there is simply luck. It cannot be maintained over the long haul but that’s ok for those who like to play the underdog because they can always say “yea well you had more people / you had more levels / you had better gear....I did pretty good though didn’t I?”. No, you didn’t do pretty good, you are a piece of shit. Your job as a PvPer is to level the playing field and to destroy that level playing field time after time after time. No excuses for anybody, the field was leveled. You live and die by your own skill. You must look yourself in the face, you must take responsibility for your own ineptitude. The line must be drawn and you must hold that line. This is where the real PvPer roams, they roam this line. They own this line. They revel in their victories and they bleed with every defeat as they must realize that there is no place to point the finger except at themselves.<P>Every KAAOSer takes being a part of this guild seriously and this guild takes every game seriously. There are very few guilds like this but all true PvP guilds are the same in this regard. The majority of the guilds out there do not have the heart of a real PvP guild..<P><b><i>“Of course im disappointed that you wouldnt accept the war”</b></i><P>A war wouldn’t have proven anything. You would have been stung and stung hard. You had and have no chance for victory in a war with us. It wouldn’t have been a war, it would have been a slaughter. You can argue this all you like but the simple fact is, one of our pets could guildwar your entire guild and win. The highest level in your guild is still very green to me and I was gone for a week and am at the low end of the average levels in our guild. Where is the challenge in that for us? We take war very seriously. If we warred with you we would spend every waking moment making you bleed until there wasn’t a one of you left with the will to log in. In the mean time, every day we delay the real PvP guilds take a level advantage over us. A war with no risk? A war with no challenge? A war with no incentive so that our competitors can take an advantage over us and try to use that advantage to slap us around? I think even a retard would agree that that doesn’t make much sense. Once the xp break at level 52 is reached, and the ceiling is within reasonable range and level advantages are mitigated, then excursions can be taken. <P><b><i>“I cant fucking stand EQ. I hate spending 12+ hours for each fukin lvl. I hate sitting in a room camping some POS peice of loot for another 10 hours.” </b></i><P>You should not be spending 12+ hours for a level. It should take you no more than an average of 4 hours per level from 20 - 30. 30 - 40 an average of 7 hours per level (Hell Levels calculated in). 40 - 50 an average of 9 hours per level (Hell Levels calculated in). Some people can do it much faster, I find this to be a solid average considering distractions and reasonable play time per session. Some people take much longer because they don’t understand the game.   <P>As far as what you do with your time, spending 10 hours camping the same spawn, that’s something you are going to have to work out for yourself. Personally, I use the time to keep moving towards a set goal. The time seems to fly by much quicker and the levels come almost as a byproduct. <P>In anycase, it’s going to be more of the same in Shadowbane. We simply do not fuck around, we take things seriously, we learn the game quickly. We have the heart, desire, and drive to hit our goals. And our goals in every game is to be a dominant force. We have, and always will, stand the test of time. <P>Azmodion<BR>KAAOS
