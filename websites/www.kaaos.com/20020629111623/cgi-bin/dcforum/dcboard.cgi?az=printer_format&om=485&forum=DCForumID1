Someday it'll happen Sb and all who fuckin knows. Well see and maybe me and Kafat can try and get himself some respect again. Dunno...but well see. Old times are hard to forget. <P>/scooby doo<BR>

Kafat, or Fat K1d as we knew him is dead to us. He's all grown up now and has no time for kiddie games, in other words, he's gone from KAAOS.<P>Nurgling, AKA Swiftfingers Mcoy
