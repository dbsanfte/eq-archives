----------------------------------------------------

Hedron sat idly at a tavern on some world, in some universe.  Whatever it was he drank burned as it went down.

The fires of his soul were dampened, and to those who sat drinking in the same room - they saw only a weak drunk in the corner.  Sometimes, Hedron himself saw only a weak drunk.  He felt drained.  The illusion he had maintained until recently had taken more from him than he had ever thought it would.

The price had been high.  High to maintain it, high to lose it.  And now that he had paid it all and been left with nothing, he felt no desire for anything.  The drink in his hand represented the most trouble he would go to for satisfaction.

Still... back in the dark pits of the pupils of his eyes, the fires always burned.  Sometimes brighter, sometimes dimmer.  It was merely a question of what unfortunate soul would awaken the fire again.

Until then, his drink burned more than his eyes, and his soul slept.

Dreaming and death are so similar.  And yet one brings strength back to you, and the other one ends strength.  Dreaming or death?
