         <blockquote>
         While I am personally partial to turn-based PvP systems, this is not a very popular system in today’s market for several reasons. <P>As far as combat area, DSO tried to have turn-based combat integrated with a real-time (out of combat) game in having the combat screen the same screen as the regular game screen. It was a miserable experience as far as I was concerned. Someone mentioned an improvement to that idea by having a definable radius so others didn’t “stumble” into the turn-based area by accident. In theory this sounds good but the simple fact is this wouldn’t be practical due to real-estate limitations.<P>The gold box series idea of having a separate real-time combat screen worked rather well as far as I’m concerned. This is similar to what you are talking about. However, your idea is to have the combat area being a certain distance from a particular PC. I’m not so sure I like this idea though it would depend on the other factors involved within the combat area (NPC interaction, terrain, etc.). In a game like NWN where NPC’s played a role in PvP combat, people would need to jockey for position. In this case, it would be a bad idea to have the combat area based on the position of a particular PC. In this case a definable area would serve better.<P>The one great thing about having a definable combat area is closure. PvP is not simply about killing your opponent, it’s about competition and winning or losing said competition. If someone flees they lost, it means the same as them dying. So who gives a shit if they can flee or not?<P>As far as luck, a certain amount of luck is a good thing. It keeps things interesting. That being said, too many variables and luck having too much influence is a bad for competition. Speaking of variables, variables can be a real problem for balance and competition. Too many variables means less tactical and more luck. What you chose to bring to the plate can weigh the outcome. While this may be fun for some, I prefer that in fight actions do the talking. I like an even or similar set of “facts” for both players. Their in-fight tactical decisions deciding the outcome. Add in “some” luck and it’s their tactical decisions in the face of that luck factor which makes a PvP encounter interesting to me.  <P>I do not like variables such as stats that swing widely in range from extremes. I do not like “gear” that has profound effect on PvP. Stats and gear should be tempered so that there is a small variable which can “enhance” PvP but not weight it too heavily. <P>On speed of combat and healing....Chess is far too slow for whom? Do you think a chess match would last very long if you were playing against a grand master? I personally don’t like PvP that lasts 10 seconds. There are far too many 1 - 2 shot PvP games out there. It’s pathetic. <P>As for healing, healing is fine if implemented properly. Healing is a counter spell. PvP should have counters. However, healing is a bad counter when it is the only counter and when it’s not balanced properly (UO for example).<P>The biggest problem with turn-based games these days is number of players. If you have too many people in one fight it takes too long to get to your turn, there is too much down time. How many is too many? Well, you need to have a few seconds to actually manipulate the keyboard/mouse/hot keys or what have you (to make your move). 5 seconds is not long enough especially if it must be sustained. You’ll miss some moves from time to time, 5 seconds would be too frustrating. You must also consider the CPU carrying out the turns. If it flies through the effects of a turn too fast people won’t be able to see WTF just happened. You’ll need to add another 5 - 10 seconds to every person’s turn for the computer to carry out the turns. <P>So let’s say we went with a sliding timer based on the number of people in a fight. 2 people = 20 seconds to do your turn plus 5 - 10 seconds for the computer to display the results (let’s call it 5 for argument sake). Each turn would take 50 seconds in this case. Let’s say you only get 15 seconds for your turn when there are 4 or more people. In this case, 3 people = 75 seconds per turn and 4 people = 80 seconds. Let’s say it adjusts down to 10 seconds when there are 8 or more people, I don’t think you could reasonably have less than a 10 second timer. In this case, 7 people = 140 seconds and 8 people = 120 seconds. You are at 2 minutes  per turn once you hit 6  people. What if you had 20 people. 20 people = 300 seconds per turn. 5 minutes per turn, that’s a long god damn time. Too long as far as I’m concerned. But as you can see, any more than this is getting way out of hand. <P>So say you push 20 people at 5 minutes a turn. That’s 10 v 10. In this day and age, that’s not enough of an option in one fight. Many guilds are hundreds strong. For my tastes, 10 people in a fight is fine, 20 people in a fight is more than enough but for many people, they will not enjoy this limitation.<P>Lastly, you mentioned different types of turns:<P>You mentioned logical cycle, I like this option best. <P>You mentioned multi-cycle turns (everyone moves, then everyone attacks), I don’t see how this would decrease the total time per round. It does sound interesting though. However, it would have it’s  ’s and -‘s, in lieu of a single cycle turn, from a tactical standpoint. I think it’s a viable option though if implemented correctly. But again, I don’t see how this would decrease the total time per round. <P>You mentioned all turns carried out at the same time. In the logical cycle with a 20 second timer, in essence, you get 40 seconds to “think” about your turn in a 1 on 1. In a 6 on 6 (with a reduced timer) you would get 120 seconds to “think” about your turn. If everyone gets 20 seconds, at the same time, and then all the turns are carried out it would speed up the game obviously. However, you would loose the tactical “flow” of the game. Here again, just as in real-time PvP, you are sacrificing good PvP for faster PvP. So what’s the answer? What are we willing to give up? Well, personally, if you gave me this option or a “real-time” game that has combat “slowed down” a bit I think I would prefer the real-time game. The same time, turn-based, “could” be slightly more tactical in that there are actual visible turns that spell effects can be timed off of but that’s about the only benefit. There are several drawbacks to this system. It doesn’t flow, people move out of position so that selected actions are in fact invalid, you don’t get to see what’s coming thus nurfing counter-tactics. While real-time games suffer from timers being actual time (thus nurfing the tactical value of effect durations) at least you could see the action playing out, you could have casting emotes happening so you could choose proper counters, etc. All in all, I think this is a weak idea. It takes the bad of turn-based and molds it with the bad of real-time. It is a child that received only the bad qualities from its’ parents. <P>I don’t have any real thoughts on your charged base system. This system is basically a real-time system but one where your resource is your “charge”. You consume your resource based on the types of actions you take. Developers can’t even get basic real-time right yet, they can’t figure out how to properly implement and balance resource expenditure. This is why there are no good real time RPG PvP games to date. What I’m saying, basically, is that this “idea” is putting the cart ahead of the horse. <P>Azmodion<BR>KAAOS
