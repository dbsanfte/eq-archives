----------------------------------------------------
The class/level system when multi classing is allowed and there is an easily attainable max level  (NWN/DSO) quickly becomes a system where there is no different classes and no different levels.   Essentially making it a system where there is no class or level.  Those were the only AD&D pvp environments.

Levels - In EQ/AC you had this horrid system where you would camp for xp all day every day.   Someone who had less of a life than you would be able to camp more xp and therefore would be significantly more powerful than you.  To say competitive you have to camp xp all day and not pvp so as not to be totally at the mercy of a skilless fool who did nothing but camp xp.

Class - Also in EQ/AC you had a most fearsome dilema.   If you found that your choice of class (or template) was far underpowered you had to start over, now at the bottom of the xping ladder, with no hope of ever catching up.  Always to be at a disadvantage to less skilled opponents who have more time to kill.


I thought  you had written an article or 7 about the evils of the xp treadmill and such.   I guess that was some other ranting fool.
