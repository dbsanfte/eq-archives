<blockquote>I tried "ladychinabalorswife" - it says its taken. I tried all the various inbetween forms too. So I guess I'll just post here since the only person that I can identify as a bonafide adult that has expressed the verbage of a bonafide child is Myschief. I'm not really sure if she's KAAOS or not, but I know she frequents this board. And this is for all you others that chose take a moment to listen.<P>First of all - I am a roleplayer. I've always been a roleplayer. The curse of my life, and those around me in game, is that I have a random name generator churning out possible letter/personna combinations at all times of the day and night. I have never scoffed at roleplaying, and in fact the Mercs used to be the best god damned roleplayers in Yserbius. They had all kinds of behaviors based upon storylines they made up - hell in DSO they kidnapped somebody as part of a roleplaying plot line. So Delusion, who admitted that he knew nothing at all about the Mercs, is quite wrong in thinking they are not roleplayers. They roleplay chaos and evil. They disrupt ONLINE weddings because they are CHAOTIC AND EVIL. Some of the new ones don't really admit to being roleplayers, in spite of hours of brain bashing at my hands getting them to see that what they do is roleplaying even if they're not tossing out "thee's and thou's". Some of them really suck at what they do. But we're not talking about an entire guild now, we're talking about me. <P>The whole medieval wedding idea was my idea. I worked very hard on it, all my family and friends were kind enough to sigh and give in to another one of my "ideas". Balor was kind enough to sigh and give in. Nobody roleplayed anything at the wedding. Nobody used old english, it was merely a choice of dress. Everything that people wear to weddings is totally fake in my opinion from the tux to the mother of the bride's gown. Why not have people come in something that would inspire conversation and a happy little silly feeling of fun. And it DID inspire just that. Thats all I wanted, and thats exactly what I got. <P>There were no "Mercs" at the wedding. The Mercs are a guild of game players, they don't have Merc Con's, or little beer bashes. My wedding had NOTHING to do with what Balor has created and what I support online. <P>What I also support online is as much laughter and fun as possbile, its a dry and boring place without the wit and creativity and sometimes stupidity of the people that are fortunate enough to have access to this huge world made small. I'm happy that my website was able to supply some laughter, I hope maybe one or two people came away with IDEAS, which is what I truly worship - well besides Balor.<P>So lets all laugh and have fun and be cruel, but don't wrap it up in some kind of a cop out excuse of "Well, they DESERVED it!" I deserve to be killed in a game because I cannot defend myself, and I deserve to be called a moron on a board because I called somebody else a stupid asshole. I deserve to have my website and my memories mocked because I made it public, and I run with a real rough crowd. But NOT because I'm a hypocrite that doesn't roleplay but has a period wedding.<P>Get it? Got it? GOOD.<P>*smirks* (ala Warlord's wench, sorry can't remember your name) ;p It'll bug me for the rest of the night, damn it...</blockquote><hr><b><font size=2>Table of contents</font></b><hr>

You are a hypocrite.  You are an imbecile.  I'll try not to go into the fact that you can't even figure out how to make an account on EZ (easy -- get it??? easy!) boards.  Apparently you didn't even understand my post.  Because um, reading comprehension is HARD!<P>Lets get a few things straight here:<P>One.  You don't 'run with a rough crowd.'  People who run with rough crowds don't have medieval roleplay weddings and buy medieval costumes for said wedding.  They belong to gangs that kill and maim and steal and shoot drugs in real life.  There you sit in your middle class home with your middle class computer and your middle class thoughts pretending to be part of a 'rough crowd.'  You most assuredly are not, regardless of the barbs and insults you throw around on message boards.  <P>Two. As I said in my post, your wedding didn't deserve to be made fun of at all.  No one's wedding does and I've been to some pretty sorry weddings.  Your website didn't provide a laugh and as a matter of fact you all looked like you were having a nice time.  Yay you.  Nice times are good to have.  <P>Nice time or not there are times and situations where I believe (your mileage may and obviously does vary) the good natured (and perhaps not so good natured) insults we throw around on boards like this are not appropriate.  Your wedding was one of those situations.  Ego's illness was another.  Anyone's death would be yet another.  <P>Three.  The very fact that you feel that putting your wedding on display makes you deserving of ridicule just blows my mind.  Woman if you feel you *deserve* humiliation you need help.  Professional psychiatric help.  I would suggest a frontal lobotomy but its apparent you've already gone that route.  <P>Last but certainly not least is your admitted disruption of online weddings.  Regardless of what YOU think of those weddings they are important to some people.  How the fuck would you like it if a group of people came to YOUR wedding and started throwing the food around and beating up your guests?  Then, after your wedding was ruined, these people just looked at you and said "well we were roleplaying being assholes.  If you don't like it tough.  We were roleplaying."   It would pretty much ruin the event for you huh?  I'm just guessing here but I'm thinking maybe.. just maybe.. I'm on the right track.  Of course given your other idiotic ramblings here and elsewhere perhaps you'd enjoy that sort of thing -- it kind of goes with being part of a 'rough crowd.'  <P>Yes, you are a hypocrite China.  More than that, you are a coward.  You and Balor only roleplay where its 'safe' -- in real life.  You don't do it online because you know there's assholes like yourselves that will ruin it for you.  You said "Why not have people come in something that would inspire conversation and a happy little silly feeling of fun. And it DID inspire just that. Thats all I wanted, and thats exactly what I got."  Why not, indeed.  Why not have a little fun.  Aren't you happy that your fun wasn't disrupted by the type of behavior you 'support online.'<P>The fact that you are proud of pking roleplayers who don't have a clue as to how to fight back also blows my mind.  WTF? <P>Cowards.  Hypocrites.  Assholes.  Yeah the Mercs have it all.  Welcome to the 'rough crowd.'<P>Anyway I diverge in beliefs with my Kaaos buddies on this particular issue so I'm probably going to get slammed here.  Nonetheless it doesn't make you any less of an idiot.  <BR>

For the record, the "rough crowd" I run with is ONLINE. The people I come into contact with do not feel the need to be polite or maintain manners - use yourself as an example. I don't know what kind of excuses you've fed yourself for your post on the Lum board, well actually I do, they're all right there. "She deserves it", why? Because umm.... Oh yes, because I thought Ego was using the message board to play a game. And because Mercs messed up an ONLINE wedding? I have no knowledge of them doing this recently, I recall the Mercs of old descending upon a host in Yserbius where a wedding was taking place and challenging all the guests. When the Mercs hosted a "fight night" in AC they were prepared for people that would want to disrupt the event, they had high level power people on guard at all points to stop the intruders - while not the point of this post perhaps you might want to pass that suggestion on to other ONLINE brides and grooms.<P>My first impression from your post is that you really need to take some time off the computer. There is absolutely no distinction in your mind between real life and ONLINE. How unfortunate.<P>I haven't been "humiliated" by any of this. Its really hard for me to get worked up because somebody thinks I missed a time period by 100 years, or because somebody else they're just too cool to have fun my way. What I SAID was that if I make a move to put something public, and then I tell people about it within that "rough crowd" (aka lacking in restraint and etiquette) then I really have nobody at all to blame but myself for the fall out. Yes, I DESERVE to have to listen to people like you bellowing about ONLINE weddings and what some group of people that have NOTHING to do with my reality did at some ONLINE wedding.<P>Since you have shown no ability to seperate my reality from your fantasy I forgive you your childish words. Maybe online is all you've got, maybe is where you're best. I use online to supplement my leisure time, not give meaning to my life. <P>Be strong. Be happy.

"For the record, the "rough crowd" I run with is ONLINE. The people I come into contact with do not feel the need to be polite or maintain manners - use yourself as an example."<P>I suppose the term 'rough crowd' means different things to different people.  If you think a group of mannerless drooling idiots that have learned how to say "I roxxer joo!" constitutes a rough crowd then who am I to argue with you?<P>You know what you remind me of?  You ever see that old Clint Eastwood flick called "Every Which Way But Loose?"  In it there's a gang of bikers who are so pathetic that when they get pulled over by the cops, the officer is laughing too hard to give them tickets.  They start jumping up and down saying "We are evil!  We demand our tickets!  We are badasses! We are rough and tough and we demand you take us in and jail us like the criminals we are!"  You and the Mercs so remind me of that.  "We are SO evil!  We will prove it! We are a rough crowd!  We can cuss and stuff and we have no manners!"<P>You are so mannerless that when I accuse you of being heartless to Ego you go apologize.  Anyone in Kaaos would have said "So?  I'm a bitch.  No shit Sherlock -- I'm in Kaaos.  Your point?"  But no, you run to apologize for being heartless and then the next moment post about how tough you are.  And when I call you on your bullshit you defend it.  Right.  Whatever.  OK sistah -- you win.  You run with a rough crowd.  I concede.  I am scared.  You slay me man.<P>"I don't know what kind of excuses you've fed yourself for your post on the Lum board, well actually I do, they're all right there. "She deserves it", why?"<P>I never said that.  As a matter of fact I said the exact opposite.  Reading comprehension.  Its tough, I know, but if you apply yourself I'm sure that even you can figure out what the little words mean.  YOU are the one that said you deserved the humiliation.  Let me quote from your post: "I deserve to be killed in a game because I cannot defend myself, and I deserve to be called a moron on a board because I called somebody else a stupid asshole. I deserve to have my website and my memories mocked because I made it public, and I run with a real rough crowd."  See how right there you said you deserved to be mocked?  <BR> <BR>"Because umm.... Oh yes, because I thought Ego was using the message board to play a game."<P>Well see, this goes to the heart of the fundamental difference between a bunch of loosers like the Mercs and the guys in Kaaos.  The idiots you hang out with think its funny to say they've died or have some sort of serious illness in real life when they don't and they do it often enough that when ANYONE does it you automatically assume they are being a looser like yourself.  The people in Kaaos don't do shit like that.  They don't need to.  They really are very good at what they do and don't need to feign death and illness to get attention.  The Mercs, on the other hand, emulate festering piles of shit in the hope that they will, at the very least, attract some flies -- that being better than the loneliness they are used to.  <P>"And because Mercs messed up an ONLINE wedding? I have no knowledge of them doing this recently, I recall the Mercs of old descending upon a host in Yserbius where a wedding was taking place and challenging all the guests. When the Mercs hosted a "fight night" in AC they were prepared for people that would want to disrupt the event, they had high level power people on guard at all points to stop the intruders - while not the point of this post perhaps you might want to pass that suggestion on to other ONLINE brides and grooms."<P>Again, let me quote your post.  Consistency is good in fantasy and roleplay.  Also in lying.  You should make note of this.  In any case in your first post you spewed: "So Delusion, who admitted that he knew nothing at all about the Mercs, is quite wrong in thinking they are not roleplayers. They roleplay chaos and evil. They disrupt ONLINE weddings because they are CHAOTIC AND EVIL."  <P>"My first impression from your post is that you really need to take some time off the computer. There is absolutely no distinction in your mind between real life and ONLINE. How unfortunate."<P>Whatever.  You know nothing about me, nothing about my private life, and I, at least, can tell the difference between bullshit and when someone actually does have a scary as all fuck virus.  <P>"I haven't been "humiliated" by any of this."<P>Good for you.  Here's something to chew on shit-for-brains: Either you really are a malicious, unfeeling, souless bitch or you really are/were too stupid to tell Ego was telling the truth. I am going with the latter myself.  I think you are also too stupid to figure out when you've been humiliated.  Or when you've humiliated yourself.  But again, whatever.  Enjoy your illusions if that is what you have to enjoy.<P>"Its really hard for me to get worked up because somebody thinks I missed a time period by 100 years, or because somebody else they're just too cool to have fun my way."<P>Huh?  What field did that come out and why?  <P>"What I SAID was that if I make a move to put something public, and then I tell people about it within that "rough crowd" (aka lacking in restraint and etiquette) then I really have nobody at all to blame but myself for the fall out."<P>No.  What you said was that you deserved to be mocked. See the quote above.<P>"Yes, I DESERVE to have to listen to people like you bellowing about ONLINE weddings and what some group of people that have NOTHING to do with my reality did at some ONLINE wedding."<P>Again, huh?  I made one small post about how you were a hypocrite because you and your guild disrupt roleplay events online but that you have them in real life.  I'm not sure what this has to do with the above statement.  <P>"Since you have shown no ability to seperate my reality from your fantasy I forgive you your childish words."<P>Trust me, you are not in my fantasies.  A fact that I shall forever be grateful for.<P>"Maybe online is all you've got, maybe is where you're best. I use online to supplement my leisure time, not give meaning to my life. "<P>Yay you.  <P>"Be strong. Be happy."<P>Same to ya. <BR> <BR>Myschyf<BR><a href="http://www.lumthemad.net" target="_blank">http://www.lumthemad.net</a><P>P.S.  I went to my first medieval style wedding in the late 70s.  In real life my friends are an odd assortment of techies, actors, larpers and reenactors.  These type of weddings have grown considerably more common since then.  'Roleplay' or 'Period' weddings are extremely common.  These would be weddings that are, in fact, real, but the participants and guests come dressed in a period costume.  The fact that you had a medieval dress wedding does not make you individualistic.  Trust me on this one. Now if you had done something a little less common that might have impressed me.  This past weekend one of my friends that does reenactments went to a WWI wedding.  Now THAT was cool.  They did a small battle reenactment for the guests too.  <P>China your wedding idea is/was fine.  Stop defending it.  It was your wedding and you can do what you goddam well please at your wedding.  If you want to have a wedding where everyone gets naked and prances around a mulberry bush well then you can do that and I wouldn't mock you for it.  I'm mocking you for being a hypocrite and an idiot and it has very little to do with your actual wedding.<P>

You can't make people believe that something that crossed the line of "okay" in this little pretend world was deserved. Thats exactly what your little post on the Lum board was doing. Nobody seemed to be getting the point, or agreeing with the behavior a suppposed neutral top-notch "gaming" site displayed.<P>You've yet to prove your point, and you continue to be rude and obnoxious. Is this a personna or is this just really you? One more time I shall say again - I AM A ROLEPLAYER. I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN A ROLEPLAYER. This was not a "MERC WEDDING", this was "MY WEDDING", I AM A ROLEPLAYER IN GAMES. I DO NOT USE COOL DOOD WORDS OR R33T SAYINGS. See your problem is that little issue of "seperateness". When I'm ONLINE I am a total Merc supporter, why? BECAUSE MY HUSBAND FOUNDED THE GUILD. Also because they're not whiners, lord knows I can't stand a whiner. When I am OFFLINE I am not telephoning my MERC FRIENDS and chatting with them about my plans, goals and ambition. I am not inviting them to my child's birthday party or summer barbque or MY WEDDING. So, when you posted on the Lum board about the raging hypocricy that I have shown as a NON-ROLEPLAYING MERC, and then having the audacity to have a medieval dress-up wedding - YOU WERE JUST TOTALLY WRONG. I have NEVER disrupted an online wedding. I've offiated at a few, so has Balor. Of course the sacrificial virgins did make quite a rucus when we pronounced the bride and groom Man and Wife, but what the hell. WE DID IT OUR WAY. <P>OUR WEDDING WAS BETWEEN BALOR AND MYSELF. IT WAS NOT A MERC FUNCTION. Though I have endless patience for the idiocy of juveniles, I have little for you and your bizarre and quite error-ridden explanation of what "THE POINT" is that people should be getting.<P>You were truly ridiculous in your little essay on how "rough" I am. I said I run with a "rough" crowed - you continue to be a fine example of my point of the people I come into contact with on a regular basis and their lack of anything vaguely resembling civility. Lady China is about as rude and obnoxious as I can make her. However, I am able to put her aside and reach out to people when I know that its a real person thats in need. First you're outraged that I joked with Ego about what I thought was a little game on the board. Then you're malicious about the fact that I apologised if he felt I let him down in any way. <P>Please do try and get a seperation between reality and fantasy. Between peronnas and personalities. Between valid points and imaginary grievances. <P>We can go back to our regularly scheduled roleplaying any time you'd like take your paws off the issue of what I do in my LIFE and what I do ONLINE.
