Since I am dismissed then I will say one last thing to you oh my lord haha.

 You have failed to convince me or anyone else that are goody type players that play for fun and fun only.

You have failed to realize my playing style in saying that I would kill an npc. The only time an npc would be good to kill is when they have something to offer in return such as black sandals in Ultima Online. I am a progressive player and object oriented one at best. Not kill everything one site including pking new players. That is what evil players do right? Saying you will not kill npc's would be going against your guilds playing style. (Such as the bad idea to kill an npc) The one who made the game and the game masters would prevent your team in doing such a thing? I am sure that is not the case. What about your teams idea of not having a fortification in Shadowbane?  Since KAAOS has nothing to protect with npc then how would you be using an npc as a resource? I used npc’s in Ultima to sell my junk as well. It seems like you failed worse that I did when I first made my intro to this KAAOS phenomenon. Of course I will not try to use swear words or ask to see your girlfriends or mamas breasts to boot since you are acting strange and incoherent to my style of play. That is where you come in being stuck with having to name call or give a dare. After all you must stay evil and not be like Darth Vader in episode 3. Stay in the dark side and be happy with it since that is all your team is good at.

Having that written down and done with at least you are listing some stuff and not doing what Hedron does by saying you are a loser. A generic form of a word that is just like saying "you suck". Much like being in a Beavis and Butthead episode when you have to ask yourself in what way do I suck?

Sounds like you are not the weakest link after all but are having problems knowing my gaming style ROFL! I already know your whole teams playing style. Hedron you are dismissed for being the weakest link.
