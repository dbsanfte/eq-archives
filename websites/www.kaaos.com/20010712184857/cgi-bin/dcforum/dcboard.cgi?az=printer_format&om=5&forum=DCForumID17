<blockquote>One thing that bothers me about seemless worlds is that you tend to lose on possibl<BR>e outcome of battle.   Escape.         <P>One of the most important things about playing EQ on Rallos was the location of the<BR> nearest zone line, especially if you were not near friendly guards.   For a warrio<BR>r it was even more important because they could not gate.   But even for a druid or<BR>enchanter who cant shadow step zone lines often mean the difference between surviva<BR>l and death.    Although to a lesser extent UO had zone lines, but recall served the same purpose.   I know DSO had them.  I didnt play AC much, I was working 120 hr weeks during the beta and it didnt impress me enough to get the final, but I found it rather annoying that there were MOBs wandering around who could run faster than any low level character possibly could.   There was just no way to escape, you had to win or die, sometimes if you lived long enough MOBs would give up.   But in a PvP situation that's not going to happen.<P>I fear that SB will fall into this trap, especially for slow moving races and melee types.<BR></blockquote><hr><b><font size=2>Table of contents</font></b><hr>

Let me get this straight, so you were working 20 hours a day (assuming you get Sunday off) and you still had enough time to waste on EQ and UO?<P>You fear too much about SB, for not having seen it yet.

&gt;Escape. <P>Never had much use for it. If Im going to die then it will be talking shit and face to face or face to faces. Id rather put up a fight, regardless of the odds, than piss my pants running for the nearest server line or zone border. Pathetic.<P>But then again, there is no shame in running before any fighting occurs. When you look up and find yourself alone somewhere - or get a bad feeling about a couple of players in the area - well, sometimes its good to get the hell outta dodge. Because once the fighting starts - well, that changes things.<P>&gt;One of the most important things <BR>&gt;about playing EQ on Rallos <BR>&gt;was the location of the  nearest zone line,<P>Yeah, your right about that. You had to kill the lamer gunning for that boundary if you wanted your prize - once they got to that line, turn off their comp and they disappear forever. So knowledge of where that existed was extremely important because 90% of the time attacking someone made them run straight for it. Though - I really have to admit as much as I bitched and moaned about those boundaries and the spineless players who escaped me through it...there was no better pleasure than watching the severly wounded walk and crawl those last few feet to escape and then dieing inches from it. <P>The good ole days =)<P>&gt;There was just <BR>&gt;no way to escape, you <BR>&gt;had to win or die, <BR>&gt;sometimes if you lived long <BR>&gt;enough MOBs would give up.<P>Wait.. is this the Everquest KAAOS forum? Bleh. Not to be a total jerk - we don't know much about the monster AI except that they will have different strategies, triggers, and reactions. Still, in an unregulated PvP world, MOB strategies should always be approached from a group perspective. Its not the Mob you need to worry about, its the two strange players you dont know who have suddenly taken an interest in you being alone and what not. When PvP is king, you should never solo a monster that you have a chance of dieing to - or either barely beating with heavy personal damage. Most players wont be that careful or think that way, which is kind of sad. But then again its not totally unexpected - several hundred still die each year from sticking car keys into electrical outlets or playing golf in lightning storms.<P>&gt;But in a <BR>&gt;PvP situation that's not going <BR>&gt;to happen. <P>Good. The idea is promoting conflict. Easy levelling, inexpensive equipment, item bonding etc etc. There wont be an easy escape - especially for the lazy. Awareness of your surroundings, preparation for attack, pre planned escape routes and meticulous attention to hitpoints, mana, etc save more lives than server boundaries ever could. But its hard to do and it takes work - which is why most people don't do it. Some are just born to be victims I guess. <P>Even with the best laid plans - your still going to die a lot. That percentage of death/escape/victory will rise or fall based on how carefully you spend your hours online. In UO you could be ganked in a second to a group - but there were still ways to be better prepared. In EQ, well you had to really be dumb IMO to get ganked - it was just too damn easy to escape.<P>&gt;I fear that SB will fall <BR>&gt;into this trap, especially for <BR>&gt;slow moving races and melee <BR>&gt;types. <P>Its not a trap. There will be unbalances sure. But WP has said that they will work to fix major unbalances although things will never be fully equal - and I dont think it should be. Sometimes a good offense is the best defense - and if that fails, well just dont leave town with less than 10 in a group. 10 dumb hyenas can still take down a single lion.

Guaranteeing people a safe "out" from every fight is not my idea of fun and balanced player conflict. In EQ, I can see the purpose for it. In SB, Wolfpack has a lot of reasons (in theory) for rubbing out all the cheap escapes. If death's sting really won't hurt so much (for the reasons Vosx touched on), then we should be fine without zone escapes.<P>J.<BR>damned vulpine<BR><a href="http://sb.xrgaming.net/" target="_blank">http://sb.xrgaming.net/</a>

As someone who was there, let me assure you, your wrong. Since it wasn't a declared war it wasn't a formal surrender. However, since the largest problems we faced was the masses of surrendering Iraqi troops. I'd call it a surrender. The vast majority if their line troops didn't fire a shot. Only certain segements of their regular (paid) army did. Moments before retreating I might add.

You stupid ethiopian.  When somebody runs to zone and you have two people with you it is almost sure defeat for them.  Send the person with the fastest zoning time in after them, and the other person waits at other side of zone.  When the person that chases them goes through they attack they person they are after.  This usually causes the person being attacked to zone again.  This causes them to zone right into the other player waiting at the other side.  If they zone back, the other person is on them.  This usually eliminates them.<P>And about guards.  It is a simple matter of having a higher faction than the other person does with the guards.<P>Freeport-  Easy quest in rogue guild increases faction with Freeport Milita.  Killing orcs raises faction with North Freeport guards, and you can turn their belts into the warrior guild for more faction with them.<P>Grobb-  When you enter Grobb, hug the right zone wall until you come to a room with a guard in it.  He says he wants fire beetle eyes.  You can kill lesser scarabs in Feerrott, or fire beetles in S Ro for fire beetle eyes.  But the easier way is to buy them from merchants around Oggok or the gysies in S Ro.  As a reward for the quest you get gems which when sold pays for the price of the fire beetle eyes.  Also on occasion you get a brass earring.  This raises faction with Grobb guards.<P>Cabilis-  Guard next to entrance to Cabilis in Field of Bone wants 4 bone chips.  Give him the bone chips and it raises faction with every Cabilis faction.<P>Oggok-  All ogres are warmly with the guards making attacking ogres naer guards impossible.  And ogres can attack any other race here, unless you have warmly faction also.  In Oggok warrior guild they have a quest for 4 lizard meat or 4 lizard tails.  Doing this gives armor or a rusty 2hs axe, and boosts faction with guards.<P>Neriak-  If you are a dark elf then go to the Neriak Library and give Lokar T'biath 4 red wine bottles at a time.  Each time it boosts your faction with Dreadguard outer/inner which is guard faction.  If you are not a dark elf you can do the Lightstone quest in S Ro.  The guards have 1 more factions (that is right 3 different factions for Neriak guards) which is Indigo Brotherhood.  You can boost their faction by doing quest in warrior guild if you are a dark elf.  If you are not a dark elf then kill wood elf rangers in L Fay, they are all level 25.<P>Kaladim/Kelethin-  Kill Crushbone orcs.<P>Ak'anon-  Kill Minotaurs.  If you are not KOS you can also do scrapmetal quest in Ak'anon.<P>Rivervale-  Any race can do this.  If you are KOS you just have to be about levl 12 so the quest giver wont kill you.  In misty thickit there is some halfling in his hobbit hole who wants bandages.  Give him bandages 4 at a time until you have warmly faction.<P>Mistmoore-  Not a town but great PvP grounds if you are not KOS.  Kill a lot of bards and you ownt be KOS.  The great thing is almost everyone else is KOS to everything in zone.<P>Qeynos-  Kill gnolls.<P>Halas....  Why the hell am I even wasting my time telling you pussies how to kill people?  You will still get owned in PvP, bah.
