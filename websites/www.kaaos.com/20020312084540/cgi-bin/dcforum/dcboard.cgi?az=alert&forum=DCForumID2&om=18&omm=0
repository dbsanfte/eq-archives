Silence...
  
Oblivion?
  
No.  I can feel my limbs.  Move them no, but I can feel them.
  
What is this?
  
How long have I been asleep?
  
A cocoon? A prison perhaps?
  
No. Too conformed to my physical form.
  
Perhaps I'll rest awhile longer.  
  
....
  
  
Vibrations?  
  
Listen. Yes I can do that.
 
....
  
  
Life, all around me.  But this shell holds me firm.  Shatter it? Not yet.  Pass through, that would be much easier for now.
  
Caverns.
  
Interesting..
  
Daylight.
  
Mountains. Children laughing?
  
Yes. A lot of them.  A large city stretches out before me.  Flying carriages, Huge metallic birds.
  
The future Perhaps?  
  
....
  
..
  
Inspection... Returning to my starting point on this rock, it seems to be the core of the planet.  How long had I fell through space?  
  
Time travel...
  
Watching my form float throw space.  Speed up time.  
  
Micro specks of dust cling too the form.  
  
How Long indeed?
  
The asteroid that I am/was floats and falls through space.
  
Stuck in the gravitational pull of a sun so like many others that support life on planets captured by there pull.
  
Stability.  The orbit is no longer erratic.
  
Water?
  
Eons perhaps?
  
Plants...
  
Early life.
  
Man.
  
And all from a sleeping god.
  
Careless to sleep that long?  Why? What could bother me?
  
But to bring life in such a manner.  That is positively amusing.
  
Return to the future.
  
Children laughing.
  
My children?
  
In a way I guess.
  
The core...
  
Held firm...
  
Sleep?
  
No...
  
Shrug
  
The planet that was my cocoon shatters.
  
Sleep..
  
Yes....
