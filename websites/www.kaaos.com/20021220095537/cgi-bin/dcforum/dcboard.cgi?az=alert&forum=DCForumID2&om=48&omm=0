[font size="1" color="#FF0000"]LAST EDITED ON 12-07-01 AT 05:10&nbsp;PM (PST)[/font]

Dawn broke upon the scarred fields of Halket, where the dead lay stiff in the morning mist. Green grass holding back flood waters of blood as the lethal dance of battle grew quiet. Brids of prey silently glided in as if deaths shadow had crawled from the abyss and only the sound of feast caught the cool air. Lances stood naked in the sun, jutting up out of the ground like the teeth of some long forgotten dragon, thier banners tattered and lost to the passage of time. The distinct sulphurous smell of charred men and armour laid heavy, swirling about betraying the presence of arcane magics. 

I watched as the earth wept, rain fell upon my poisoned soul and bloody body. My childhood friend lay beside me, staring accusingly at me, eyes milky he judged me and found me not to measure and wanting more. Yes I was a betrayer, the greatest of all time and well lucky enough to cheat the fates and destroy an Empire. 

Cutting the leather thong from my wrist, I grabbed my sword blade and hurled the cruel blade towards the sun as I crawled from the mosh pit of embattled soldiers and dead or dying. My spit had blood in it, wounded it was a lethal blow to be sure. I remembered the Knight, shining in his silvered armor as he pointed me out in grand melee. Men and sword clashed violently, primal voices spoke to us all, and looks varied amoung each man. I pushed a dying man aside, side stepped an oncoming rush from another as the Knight beckoned me and unsheathed a beam of light which could have only been his sword.

 The muddy earth rushed up to meet me as I struggled towards the Silver Knight. Armor clashed and blades met in savage conflict, as my hilt trapped incoming sweeps. I paid for the death of others ten times ten in number, and worked my tired legs ever onward in the darkening twilight of dusk. Feet heavy as stone I raised my battered shield at the sky and caught several strikes, without even looking I lashed back. Men screamed in agony, and fell like great mountains before me. The Silver Knight so far untainted in the grime of battle stood awaiting my arrival as men fought and died like the rise and fall of ocean tidal waves caught in flux at the edge of a mighty storm. I rode the currents of battle, and clawed a path ever forward, the desire in my heart, the passion of cause, and the soul of a demon fueled my rage. Suddenly I felt a great pain lance through my body, I stumbled and fell to a knee. Like the shattering of mosaic glass I felt pieces of me scatter to the winds. Without hesitation I drew myself up and fought on. Time itself began to slow and blurr the reality I found myself in. The Knight full of grace and nobility stretched out a hand and helped me to my tired feet. There we two stood, taking note of one anothers strengths and weaknesses. I fielded my blade, and gripped my shield tight as our single combat began in earnest. 

Sweat trickled down my face, mingling with the blood and dirt of ferocious combat as I looked upon the visage of my deadly opponent. I hesitated as he leveled his weapon at me, the sound of other battle distant and forgotten. It was as if we two were the deciding fight for the out come of the conflict, yet I was not aware of such an arrangment. 

The glare off the Knights vambrace surprised me and blinded me against attack, and allowed me no save verses his two handed crushing blow. His sword cleaved my shield rendering it into splinters, the crackling wood groaning beneath the force of the blow. I returned with a lightning quick counter strike leaving his pristine silver armor dented, scratched, and split. A howl escaped my cold bloodless lips, as I charged quickly for an opening I found in his defensive stance. I struck upon his mantle yet again with more vigor then the last, yet as if scryed through a crystal ball the Knight stepped back and caught my blade in his hilt thus trapping the weapon. In a foolish move to retain my blade, and free its capture I fell in behind it's hilt and drove forward to topple the shining Knight and deny him his footing. The tactic in it's cruedness worked, as he released my weapon and readjusted for his strike. We two danced this deadly waltz for what seemed like eternity, as the clouds passed over head, and darkness cloaked each of us in fine thread. With only torch light as a beacon to see by we both struggled in vain to breach each others fragile defense and force of will to continue on. 

My sword blade nicked and scarred the Knights armor, as he brought his great sword in a great arc carving a deep wound at my side. The beams of the enchanted great sword shone through the darkness bathing the hill side in an erie glow as if the sun had broke free from it's nightly imprisonment. As the Knights razor sharp sword withdrew from my body a shallow rush of warm air whispered from me. I grasped the Knights armor clad gauntlet, forcing through will alone to hold my own weapon. Quickly my strength drained from the hand which obeyed my commands and numbly I released my weapon to fall at my side. The second blow came at my shoulder severing nerves, bone, and muscle. Leaving me defenseless, wounded, and cripple the Knight tore free of my grasp like a mother from her child. Pushing me aside and leaving me lying in the mud discarded like rotten cabbage. There I laid awaiting deaths swift wings, growing colder and finding my breathing coming in gulps like the suffocation of fish from clear water streams.  That morning a God of Vengence, Destruction, and Pain filled me, and I drank from the chalice of blood.  Renewed in body and spirit I rose that morning to seek revenge.  A force of death imbued with the strength of my patron dieties black shadowy might I sought the Knight.  In my current state as a Divine Avatar of Destruction I swept the lands cutting down the weak and helpless as the cries for mercy rose high enough to scare the Knight from hiding and awaken the cowardly Gods of light to the challenge.
