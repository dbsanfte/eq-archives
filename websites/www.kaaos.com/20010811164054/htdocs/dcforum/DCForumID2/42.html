         <blockquote>
         <font size="1" color="#FF0000">LAST EDITED ON Mar-14-01 AT 09:22&nbsp;PM (PST)</font><p>When I first stepped into the world of Sosaria at an inn in Moonglow, I was weak. I had little money, a few reagents, and no useful spells.<P>I ventured out into the wilderness and soon found myself dead. The foe that had slain me wasn't a fierce dragon nor a Lich Lord, but a mere deer. A fucking deer killed me? What the fuck was this? I was supposed to be a powerful mage, damnit. I decided to try something even smaller, so I attacked a little bunny. Wow, I killed a bunny, whoopety fuckin' doo.<P>I gradually worked my way up and became stronger and eventually was strong enough to kill that fuckin deer. That small feat was the first real joy I had taken in killing. <P>I soon saw some evil-looking people standing on the side of the road. I heard one mutter "Kal Vas Flam," saw flames all around me, then nothing. I thought these people who had slain me must be real good, I later found out the opposite.<P>I eventually became a half-decent mage and joined a guild. It was called Defenders of Justice, I was in the Moonglow division of it, MDJ for short. I hate joined this to get revenge on all those people who had killed all those times when I was weak.<P>After a short while I had developed some rivalry with some of my guild mates. One of them, named Archon, killed me twice in a row. I decided to fight back even though he was more skilled than I was. I toasted his ass! FUCKING WHEEEEE!!! I was considerably weaker than him and I killed him. This was one of the many conflicts I had within the guild, and mainly because of me, the guild was thrown into anarchy.<P>The guild was no longer defenders of justice, but more defilers of justice. I loved this anarchy and rivalry between members. I still wasn't the strongest mage, not even anywhere near it. Despite this, I still kicked ass of those near my own stats and skill points. This is when I discovered the joys of PvP, not when I was maxxed out like most people. <P>Then order came to the guild and most of my rivals had settled down. Damnit I didn't want to settle down. I wanted to talk shit and answer any insult with a bolt of energy. This is when I quit and went solo for a while, and I decided to raise my skill some more.<P>Fighting monsters was boring as hell, yet I wanted to be able to show my true skill me becoming a GM mage. I got bored of this and decided to fuck it and decided to start a new hobby.<P>I started using a spear, I didn't know how to use it very well so my hits were weak. I learned rather quickly, much faster than I learned magery. I eventually became a GM Fencer and decided it was time to do some major PvP.<P>I challenged people who insulted me and such, but none were brave enough to answer to my spear. I decided to join another guild, one that was chaotic like DoJ before the order came. I was out journeying where I knew some PKers were, I would join them. This is when I found out that PKers were skilless fucks who can't kill anything near their own level so they prey on newbies. Some attacked me, I killed most that did. Some attacked me in groups of 2 or 3, I often killed them even 2 against me or even 3 occasionally. <P>One day after killing some worthless PK by the crossroads, some people with the tag of GOW<CHAOS> next to their name saw my PvP ability and invited me to try out for the guild. I was soon accepted and we kicked COP ass together. COP was an order guild who were a bunch of skilless, cheating, hacking, rez-killing, k3w1-d00dz who went around claiming they were the best because they had the most members.<P>We proved them to be quite wrong. For example, 3 of us could take on 10 or so of them and we would win. Being the cowards they were, they decided to surround the healers and killed us if we resurrected since you got rezzed with only 10 out of 100 health and no weapon or armor. This forced us to leave town to get ressed, which was their plan all along. They didn't want to face anyone with real skill so they either all left or rez-killed. <P>The best 5 of the guild formed a group within the guild called Shadow Cavalry. Obviously I was in it, and we just plain owned. I began to feel like a god. Unfortunately I didn't get to savor the pride as I soon left the world of Sosaria never to return again. All that was left of me were legends and horror stories of me.<P>I had become a God. A god of Chaos. That weakling killed by a fuckin' deer had turned into a God. Some claim to be born gods, they forget that you aren't a God if you do nothing. They fall into mediocrity and obscurity claiming they are still gods. If you start from the top you can only go down. That is where they went and will go. I kept the name Fizzle to remember what had happened to other gods and what could happen to me if I let my godliness slip away.<P>One day I stumbled upon a building that looked normal but I could feel chaos, evil, and godliness coming from it. I went in and saw mostly gods like myself. I investigated it further and found that this group had many of the beliefs I did. They named themselves KAAOS Gods. I was a Chaos God, the only difference was the spelling. I decided to join them, despite a few faded souls they had among them.<P>They stuck me in a pit with a bunch of gimps. Some of them had some power but certainly not Gods like me. All I could use was a voice, which was quite a trouble since I usually let people answer to the tip of my spear. I had used words to battle from when I couldn't use force in town, but my words paled in comparison to my proficiency with a weapon. This was strange; I couldn't shut people up if they bothered me, I wasn't feared like I was in Sosaria, I had no way to prove my Godliness. All I could do was hope that the Gods could feel the power emanating from me, but this was hard with no physical embodiment.<P>All I could do was battle with words and wait for the chance to incarnate into a physical embodiment to prove my Godliness.<BR>
