<b><font size=2>Original Message<hr>"Why Everquest and not AC/Darktide?"</font></b><br>
Posted by Kyriel  on 12-05-01 at 08:46&nbsp;PM<br>
<blockquote>Why compete in Everquest, a fundamentally PvM game, when Darktide in Asheron's Call has true unlimited and challenging PvP?  Exping a character to the point where it's viable in PvP isn't the same rediculously boring task it is in EQ, and with the final removal of GEAR/speedhack/client hack/etc by Turbine, there are no longer issues of cheats.<P>All the major downsides of AC (poor graphics, limited class selection for PvP) were certainly present in NWN; I don't recall seeing a non-CL/MU KAAOSer.  On the plus side, it has many of the advantages of NWN, from low system requirements to interesting 1v1 and team v team PvP.<P>With Shadowbane most likely a year or more away, there's certainly time.</blockquote><hr><b><font size=2>Table of contents</font></b><hr>

NPC manipulation and turn based combat are not the be-all end-all of PvP.  In my opinion, a more twitch based scheme is preferable to pure turn based, even timed turn based.  Of course, if you think otherwise, that is a pretty good reason for not being in AC.<P>And yeah.. you do need to keep exping now and then, both to burn vitae and to edge closer to the exp-chain whored characters.  You could of course build your own chain, but that would require somebody to keep leveling.. and KAAOS doesn't have a history of inviting in loads of carebears to provide them with exp.<P>Logical, at least.

We had a small core (2 or 3) of people that jumped into AC and played it pretty heavily.  They liked it, but eventually got bored.  I think the leveling treadmill got them.<P>Although you can become PVP viable in relatively short order (IF someone is twinking you), you then have to keep leveling your balls off.  Ultimately, that sucks.

In the begining, I had some of the most fun in my life playing Darktide... It seems to have lost its enchantment though... With the "uberguilds", whorechains, dishonesty, hacks, and glitches...  I think the duping glitch was the last straw.<P>Sadly, I must say that AC is on its last leg and is almost dead.  However, the people at Turbine definitely had very very good ideas and dreams for Asheron's Call, and I think we will see that in AC2.<P>Asheron's Call has to be the most dynamic real-time "Quake-like" PvP game ever made.  You can dodge spells, arrows, outrun people with your runskill, jump over spells, jump over walls, and many many other things, which is DAMN impressive considering that it is a pretty old game, I believe UO, EQ and AC were the first three big players out there, and I must say that when it comes to PvP, Action, and replayability, AC definitely takes the crown.<P>Unfortunately, I think its time has passed... I know the AC dev team has been going through hell with duping glitches (Anyone else notice that the *best* games are always the ones with duping bugs! eek!).  The first duping glitch they did a good job on fixing... the fix was out before hardly anyone knew about it, I believe I was one of maybe ten that knew about it, and I reported it to them.  The second duping bug took longer to fix, and remained in the game for quite some time, however it was difficult to do (it required crashing the server clusters), so it was not too serious.  The third duping glitch, however, grew completely out of control... I hear now that some of the most prized items now that used to go for hundreds of dollars on ebay are now as common as dirt...<P>Its sad that things like that can ruin a game, and that people are so shallow to cheat and ruin a game like that, but it does happen.  I keep my hopes high for AC2 though -- Turbine definitely has an incredible dev team and good ideas... With all of the new tech, and a more deep involved story line, I believe it will become the best MMO out there...  I know its on my *dr00l* list :)<P>-rob
