Some people have gone as far as to say I do not belong on the public forum. Just keep it to a yes or no answer please.

This is an easy poll guys. If I get enough No's then I will get it. Otherwise stop being a troll to my topics.<P>I had an idea about a new type of game but now I don't think I will share it.

The majority of the no's will be calculated vs the number of yes responses. That is what my poll is for. I am sorry but I can only count one yes or no answer for each person.<BR>

Unless you learn to select and reply to specific points from a long post, I guess I would have to say no.<P>But then, it's none of my business really.  I'm just a silent watcher most of the time.
