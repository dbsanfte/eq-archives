----------------------------------------------------
Hazelden looked around not remembering how he had got to the Plains of Rak'na. Whispering to himself, "My head hurts..."  Closing his eye's and rubbing his head, when his hand came away from his black hair, he noticed that his hand was covered in blood.  From his left, he heard a noise....springing around, to see what made the noise, he beheld 5 figures.  At first he didn't know what they where, but when they got closer, he knew they were orcs.

------------------

Not wanting to show his enemy, the dark robe, his weakness, Isharen spoke, "I have heard that powers are dwindling, but my god keeps my powers strong."  If he hadn't of hesitated at the beginning, the lie would have sounded good.  

When Isharen had awoken this morning, he felt as if he was missing something.  Not really knowing what it was, he went on with his normal duties.  When the daily church bells rang, he started to pray.  To his shock and dismay, he felt as if no one was listening.  Thinking that it must be some sin he had committed, he spoke all the ills he had done, and tried again.  He felt as if he were whispering to a wall....

"I know you lie, Isharen" the black robe replied.  "I to am losing my powers.  I think I know who might be causing this. Do you know of Drakkyn?"

Isharen nodded, slowly understanding what was about to be said.

"Then you probably know that Drakkyn is a mightly blue dragon who can controll the weather.  It is my feeling, and the feeling of the Council, that he is the one sapping our energies."

---------------

Hazelden, not acustom to fighting, didn't know what to do.  He, being a shepherd, had only seen orcs from a far.

The 5 orcs, saw him, and started running after him.

The first thing that came to mind, was to run.  His brain was screaming run, but his legs would not budge.

The orcs where about 10 paces away when, from Hazelden's mouth came a voice.  A voice not his own, "You shall not cause harm to the chosen one!"

The orcs kept on charging, not recognizing or just not caring about the warning.......
