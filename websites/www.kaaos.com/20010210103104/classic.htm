                no one rich, but the fight promised to be exciting. The bloodthirsty

                and waiting. Lilyth's tabby circled warily, a low whine rumbling 
                in her throat. The crowd roared when the Persian pounced, claws 
                extended, and the fight started in earnest. Coins were exchanged 
                again when Xylina's Persian seemed to choke and gag, allowing 
                Lil's tabby to pin her to the ground. Suddenly, the Persian coughed 
                up a hairball, frantically scratched her hind legs at the tabby's

                paws. Xylina narrowed her eyes, gave a smirk that paled the faces 
                of the spectators, and collected her winnings. The knight frowned 
                at the leering mage. &quot;Well,&quot; the knight said, shaking

                has their personal views about Death Matches. KAAOS is attributed 
                with really starting the phrase and determining what its meaning 
                is. Generally its a fight to the death between the two participants 
                with the loser deleting his screen name. Usually these fights 
                occur inside the Death Match Area in the Triboar Arena, but people 
                have been known to change the location because of the wimpy monsters 
                that are at that fight. Just because you go into the DM Area of 
                the Arena does not mean that you are doing a Death Match (although 
                if you die and dont CAD you will have to reroll). Rules about 
                fight etiquite and the fact that the loser will delete are always 
                stated up front so there is no confusion. This happened with Dreamforge 
                and a KAAOS'er, he never stated the fight was a delete fight so 
                he didn't, period. I don't know what the circumstances of Mich's

              <p><font color="#999999" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When 
                we were matched against KAAOS, it was clear that we'd certainly 
                lose. They really are some of the best. The surprise was not losing 
                but being crushed so decisively. It was a truly frustrating couple 
                hours when we couldn't hardly accomplish anything. Truth be told, 
                it's just not normal for Quad fights to end in 5 or 6 rounds. 
                Perhaps we were disorganized, perhaps we didn't fight well as 
                teams... but it's hard to tell when two of your team members punt 
                right away, or if everyone's held within three rounds. Even the 
                smartest PvPer around can't demonstrate much strategy in three 
                rounds while outnumbered. So I really don't have anything to say 
                about our teamwork. </font>

                well have flown across the room. </font></p>

              <p><font color="#999999" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I 
                think I'll make my official goodbye now. I'll be killing my AOL 
                account in the next day or two and then its off to the great beyond. 
                I thought about chastizing several people around here for the 
                recent crap that has come up but, in the long run we all know 
                who's who, don't we? Someone un Ultima asked me to provide a report 
                on the NWN Guilds and what they are up to. I'll attach what I 
                said about ITB to give you an idea of my thoughts and leave it 
                at that.</font></p>

                up with the boot straps and I'm out there somewhere. Those of 
                you who need a hand with UO feel free to give me a call. I'm on 
                ICQ and Email and all that stuff. For those of you that I'll see 
                again, Lets hope we see each other soon!. For those of you who 
                I WON'T see again, it was a pleasure to know you and I'll always 
                have fond memories of my time in the best house in Neverwinter...</font></p>

                to Ultima: ITB (In The Bond) - My former home in Neverwinter and 
                still a close tie. A group reputed for Pkilling and exceptional 
                organization in Neverwinter since its inception in 1992. Massive 
                organizational abilities and aggressive instincts give these guys 
                a reputation bar none in NWN communities. This guild can easily 
                operate on name alone and MOST of the Pkillers in the game pay 
                a great deal of attention to them. <br>
                <br>
                For several years the guild was essentially the monsters most 
                challenging to kill and people dreamed of one day either becoming 
                or beating them. Everyone (at one time) wanted to be an ITB and 
                only the best could get in. Once this policy changed the guild 
                started going down hill. Currently this guild is more concerned 
                with internal strife involving a fight over power and a lot of 
                personnel problems concerning old leaders who cannot give it up 
                and young members who don't know the first thing about how to 
                run a guild. There are very good people here though. Exceptionally 
                skill and adaptive players. One is writing his own video game 
                and that takes all his time. The current GM (Guild Master) is 
                a former truck driver who used to show up in everyone's home town 
                from time to time drawing us all into a tight group of friends. 
                Another former leader is so far up the butt of all the current 
                and former staffers in NW that he knows just about everything 
                about everyone.... he is, however, somewhat delusional about his 
                popularity.&nbsp;(Ed. note:&nbsp;ROFL!!) One is a staff member 
                at Lucas Art's, a game manufacturer.<br>
                <br>
                Another proposed a revolt to throw out the 10 top (eldest) members 
                a little while ago sending the guild into a huge tailspin ending 
                only because NWN was announced as closing.<br>
                This situation prevails in the current mentality of the guild 
                and divisions are insufferable in such a group. Lots of these 
                people (the guild membership) are, in one way or another, being 
                demoralized because of the internal strife and, quite frankly, 
                I don't see an end to it given the personalities involved. As 
                these people become more and more alienated they will begin to 
                break off and look for independent homes. I have notified every 
                one of them that despite previous political adversity I would 
                make them at home in whatever capacity possible here in UO. This 
                might involve you and my &quot;team&quot; or it might not, we'll 
                wait and see what the individual wants. I feel I should let you 
                know that I will go way out of my way to assist any ITB requesting 
                my assistance (without breaking certain confidences of course) 
                No news concerning an &quot;official move&quot; to Ultima Online 
                and they might be going to another game anyway as NWN shuts down.
