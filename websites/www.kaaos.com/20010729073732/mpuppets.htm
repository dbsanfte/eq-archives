                blackened door. Without breaking stride, as the walk up to it,

                on the essence of life. The Main Pit had been a sight, but this? 
                This was painful for Kaelith to look at. Except he couldn't NOT 
                look at it. There was no light in the room. Not a shred except 
                for what beamed in through the doorway from the flickering torches

                pain and hurt that it needed no light to push itself into your

                Prophet of KAAOS rose into the air and beamed a dark and evil 
                light around the room. It silhoueted an evil sleeping form stretched 
                out on a blood stained table. Again without breaking stride, Hedron's 
                foot rose up in a vicious kick, that slammed the table out from 
                under its occupant, crashing it into a wall and splintering half

                mid-air as though nothing had happened. With a slow stretch, he 
                turned and sat up, placing his feet on the floor. Seeming to take 
                no notice that there was no table to be sitting on.</b></font></p>

                large, bean beag chair. It was rather uneven shaped, but looked 
                quite comfortable. The only feature that made it look different

                in even deeper shadows behind Malhavok, unnoticed at first. He 
                leaned forward with a grin.</b></font></p>

                how do you like my little puppet?&quot; whispered Hedron. His 
                expression was gleefull at the thought of what he was making her 
                do... what he would make her do still. His eyes held that sick 
                shine that they always manifested as he walked into his torture 
                rooms.</b></font></p>
              <p><font color="#999999" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>&quot;She's... 
                suitable, Hedron,&quot; whispered the ancient evil back. He paused, 
                diabolical thought racing across his expression. &quot;You must 
                understand I can give you no true opinion without closer observation. 
                Much closer. Perhaps in my lab.&quot;</b></font></p>
              <p><font color="#999999" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>&quot;Certainly, 
                Malhavok. And before the night is done, I can say that she will 
                be available for close observation. She'll be visiting your lab. 
                Of that you should have no doubt.&quot; With a tight little smile 
                Hedron leaned back into the shadows and disappeared again.</b></font></p>
              <p><font color="#999999" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>And
