</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>
<P>26 members of Circle Noir came to Tallon Zek with a plan: to be the dominant guild.  We spent two months preparing for the opening of the server.  We divided ourselves into the essential classes for class balance; set a slow and steady level cap to keep everyone within a few levels of each other and spent time on RZ scouting out leveling spots and practicing with our classes.  We chose to be the dark team because Evil always has more fun.</P>

<P>We were always the dominant guild in our level range and our enemies quickly learned to fear us.  But initially we weren’t perceived as the top dogs on the server.  One guild raced out ahead of us in levels and was a 4 team cross-teaming guild known as Reformation.  When they were on top, cross-teaming was considered acceptable at high levels because everyone considered it necessary to do the planes and the dragons.  As we came into range, all of the high level light guilds and a few dark guilds were allied with them.  The light guilds were counting on them to give us our long-deserved &quot;come-uppance.&quot;</P>

<P>The fact that Reformation cross-teamed really didn’t bother us.  We as a guild didn’t cross-team for the sake of simplicity.  &quot;If you can hit them, kill them&quot; made for a delightfully simple credo.  What did bother us about Reformation was the fact that they had big mouths and the fact that they did not bow down to our obvious superiority.  Tempers flared when we were about 38<SUP>th</SUP> and we told them that we would kill their light members as we came into range.  They told us we would never make it past level 42 and we told them to enjoy the last few weeks of their existence.  One of us was telling the truth.</P>

<P>We hit 42 about two weeks later and the fireworks ensued.  Not only were we fighting them, we were fighting all of the light guilds that we’d routinely humiliated up until that day.  5 major battles and several skirmishes occurred over the course of a week and we won all of them convincingly despite the 8 level disadvantage (which is huge in EQ) and the O so dreaded &quot;invulnerable healing.&quot;   By the end of the week, Reformation had lost about 80% of its membership and we were crowned the new Lords of the server.</P>

<P>The first thing we did was close down Sol B and Guk to anyone who wasn’t on our team.  The only other place the lights had to level was off of the Dwarf NPC’s in Butcherblock.  For six months we had the entire light team leveling in Butcherblock despite the fact that they had us outnumbered three to one.  When they changed Tallon to coin-only, the lights tried to capitalize on the change by refusing to leave our dungeons when we killed them.  (Since they could hunt in full gear without fear, they really had nothing to lose).  Our response was to not let them recover their corpses for hours when we killed them.  We were vilified by many for our &quot;unscrupulous play&quot; but we refused to let people exploit game mechanics to make victory and territory control meaningless.  If you came into our dungeons, you risked losing hours of play time.  We expected no gentler treatment.  Our strategy worked because even though we’d often leave Sol B unattended, you’d rarely see a non-dark in there.</P>

<P>We were considered the champions of the dark team and the source of dark team pride.  And we enjoyed this role and the prestige that came with it.  The 3 other light teams resorted  to cross-teaming in order to give some semblance of competition.  But even their overwhelming superiority in numbers wasn’t enough to take back any of the dungeons that mattered.  They were so intimidated that we once even managed to completely shut down Butcherblock for the entirety of a three day weekend.  To add insult to injury, we killed all of the major dragons and gods months before the combined 3 team coalition despite our lack of key classes.</P>

<I><P>Light Cross-Teaming Laid the Groundwork</P>
</I>
<P>Lights cross-teamed from nearly the beginning.  They had no quality guilds and it was the only way they could give us even a hint of competition.  We didn’t condemn them for it, but we always wished that they would get their act together and break into different teams to make the server more interesting.  A multi-polar power dynamic is always more interesting than bi-polarism…or mono-polarism as was the case pre-Kunark.  Basically the three other teams laid the groundwork for four team cross-teaming through their bumbling incompetence.  If three teams can join together to do things, why not four?</P>

<I><P>Alienation from the Second Generation Guilds</P>
</I>
<P>CN and its friends also began to be slowly alienated from the rest of the dark team.  It started when we began to be regular planes-travelers.  Lights would leap on the opportunity to hunt in the dungeons we deprived them of since they knew we couldn’t come out of the plane of Fear or Hate until we’d finished clearing it.  When we came out we’d find second generation dark guilds cowering at the entrance to Guk and Sol B unable to hunt because the light guilds were in there.  We’d promptly kick them out but they’d tell us they’d be back the next time we did a plane.</P>

<P>To counter this, we started pulling out the stops to put the fear of god into them.  We’d kill them in the efreeti room and the ghoul lord room and we wouldn’t let them or their friends recover their corpses at all.  This sparked some immense battles and the GM’s actually had to intervene on two occasions to save the light team from collapse (the GM ordered us out of the zone for two hours and retrieved their corpses for them).  But what made us truly angry was that some of the second generation dark guilds actually had the audacity to criticize us for not stopping our planes runs at the drop of a hat to come protect them.  One guild even had the nerve to criticize our tactics as &quot;disgraceful.&quot;  That was the point when we stopped caring.</P>

<I><P>Kunark: The Ruin of EQ</P>
</I>
<P>Kunark came out a month or two later.  Many of us had wanted to quit already.  We had nothing left to prove and the game had long since lost its charm.  But we held out for Kunark with the faint hope that it might actually add something interesting to the game.  But what it ended up adding was more lag, more travel time, more tedious corpse recoveries and less pvp.  The world became so large that territory control became meaningless.  We’d kick enemies out of one dungeon and they’d have their choice of five others.  Most of us cashed out at that point and started waiting for the next game.</P>

<P>The few remaining members merged with our allies into a guild known as Infernal Assassins.  They staked out Sebilis and pretty much kept to themselves.  Any lights that came into their zone were demolished and IA took over any zone it wanted.  The rest of the dark team fell into ruin as they had neither the skill, ruthlessness or organization to stave off the 3 to 1 odds.  The 3 team light coalition just continued to be the clusterfuck it always was with a few exceptions.</P>

</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Century Gothic" SIZE=2><P>Pandemonium is Formed</P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>
<P>CN had become friends with many of their more skilled opponents in the months of battle.  Many of our enemies would start hanging out in our IRC channel along with our allies.  Light friends and dark friends came to be seen as equivalent outside the game.  It was only a matter of time before it happened in game once the team concept had lost its meaning and territory control became untenable.  Pandemonium was formed to group with some friends we’d always wanted to group with and to add a bit of controversy and flair to a dying server and a dying game.</P>

<P>The greater TZ community instantly vowed to destroy PDM but of course these were idle threats.  PDM could smash any guild or coalition of guilds pitted against it despite the fact that it is a fairly small guild.  Two months have passed and the only serious attacks have occurred on message boards.  As has always been the case on Tallon Zek…Circle Noir makes the rules…everyone else deals with it.</P>

</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Century Gothic" SIZE=2><P>To Wrap Up…</P>
</B>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P>Azmo has caught a faint glimpse of the golden age of Tallon Zek when territory control really meant the difference between success and failure.  But while Azmo can appreciate the remnant for what it is, we can only see it as the mere shadow of a once great paradigm.  The team concept died with the advent of Kunark and we’ve teamed up with our friends to break the final taboo (which, ironically, we ourselves invented).  Our hope is that this will spark a renaissance of pvp as a sinister &quot;third team&quot; is added.  But as it stands, it appears our enemies are content to confine their attacks to the message boards and gate at the sight of us in game.</P>
