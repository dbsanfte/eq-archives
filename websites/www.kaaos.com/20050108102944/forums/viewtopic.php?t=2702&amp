*****
<br />

<br />
Rot.  Decay.  Blood.  Pain, deep and enduring.  Misery, unimaginable.  Suffering, unbearable.  Time oozed slowly along like so much spilled blood, viscous, lifeless.   The sticky air roiled with greasy, crimson clouds of expelled life, smelling of sulfur and lingering fear.  That smell might have sustained his sanity, if not for the searing pain. 
<br />

<br />
His form lay broken, mutilated beyond recognition.  Bulging sacs of fluid pulsed among the gaping holes in his body, bones shattered, reformed and shattered again in an endless, aimless exhibition.  Consumed by that which he had long devoured, the creature lay writhing in an excruciating, unstoppable self-destruction of overflowing power.  This was his end.  And yet, a beginning.  
<br />

<br />
***
<br />

<br />
Freedom!  At long last, sweet freedom.  Oh, the endless slaughter that awaited them, these pitiful creatures!  Their world was doomed, and they knew nothing of the coming destruction.  The creature Orbis roared in triumph, his excitement growing as the time drew near.  Finally free from the bindings he had struggled against for so long, he now had only one goal in mind.  Death.
<br />

<br />
It had come upon him in his imprisonment, slowly, like the dawning of the sun.  For years he had sought freedom, doing everything he could to break free of his bindings and move back into the plane of his descent.  And now he was here, loathing every breath that was not spent slaughtering those who waited.  <span style="font-style: italic">Almost time</span>.  He rose from the rocks, climbing from the cave and emerging into the sunlight for the first time in centuries.  Stretching to his full height, he released a roar of ecstasy and felt his body come alive with anticipation.  He watched as the sun turned dark, taking on a deep crimson hue and casting long, thick shadows.  His time had arrived...
<br />

<br />
***
<br />

<br />
Life after life, being upon being – all manner of creature fell before the onslaught, destroyed and consumed by the inferno that was Orbis.  All across the planes, in every realm within his reach, he raped, maimed and mutilated, desecrating  their bodies in every way imaginable.  Tearing skin from flesh, flesh from bone, he tore them apart, fist-fucking their gaping wounds with savagery, twisting handfuls of still connected entrails into slimy waste.  When the screams ceased, nothing remained but barely recognizable piles of gore, steaming in rivers of blood…and he moved on.  For years he tore across worlds, rending the fabric between, and laid waste to all he found.  Never stopping, never tiring, he flung all who opposed him across the skies in arcs of blood. 
<br />

<br />
All the while, his power grew – fueled by the ceaseless murder, the endless destruction of life.  He took nothing from his victims,  yet every life ended in savage violence and he grew stronger.  The simple act of killing, the screams, the look in the eyes of every creature as it was raped, mangled and destroyed, the smell of steaming flesh, the taste of newly spilled blood – these were the things of power, the drug that never satisfied, yet they built his strength, sustained his fury as he ripped apart all in his reach.
<br />

<br />
On and on he killed, a decade and more he ended life in a ceaseless orgasm of death, a frenzy of delirious rage which nothing could pacify.  Yet part of him remained the cold, calculating instrument of death he had once been, lurking deep in his consciousness, directing the inferno.  Standing amongst piles of the writhing, screaming masses, bathing in their gore, he created a world of butchery.  Death surrounded him, filling him with a twisted, wild pleasure beyond anything he had known.  Blind within the fury, his world shifted, and he found himself enveloped in silence.  The scream were gone, the thick smell of death vanished.  He was almost shocked into sanity, but he quickly realized where he was.  He stood inside a huge, shadowy cavern, the only light source coming from a river of bubling fire in a crevasse far below.  He stood before a crumbling bridge beyond which lay a massive wall of black stone inlaid with intricate carvings and the bones of the dead.  He stood at the Gates.  And too soon.
<br />

<br />
Looming above, the massive Gates stood closed against him, mocking his effort and denying his very existence.  A stirring in the darkness, and a grotesque form emerged to confront him.  Heaving with the effort it took just to stand still, dripping with blood and gore, Orbis glared as the Gatekeeper approached.
<br />

<br />
A bulbous, yellow mass of flesh, the Gatekeeper stood a head taller than the creature.  His splotchy hide split in places, leaking puss and smelling of rot.  Decay.  Fucking DEATH!  The urge to kill again boiled over.  He fought to stay in control.
<br />

<br />
"YOU HAVE BEEN SUMMONED, CREATURE," the Gatekeeper boomed, his echo carrying upward through the deep cavern.
<br />

<br />
The creature Orbis could only laugh.  Images of death burned through his mind.  This was not how he had expected it to happen.  He could feel it there, inside him, quickly growing beyond his control.  <span style="font-style: italic">Almost there</span>, he thought.  <span style="font-style: italic">All those years, and this motherfucker takes it all away</span>.  His thoughts ran wild, then.  The power coursing through him threatened to take his very existence.  Control.  Silence.  Focus.  And then it dawned on him, suspicion turning to knowledge and burning through his mind.  <span style="font-style: italic">The Gatekeeper's timing is not so good</span>, he thought.  "No one summons me, Gatekeeper," he growled out.  "I am here!"    
<br />

<br />
A smirk.  "Your mindless destruction has not gone unnoticed, little one.  Perhaps I can offer you something more worthwhile." 
<br />

<br />
"The Gatekeeper can offer nothing of his own." replied Orbis.  "State your business, or I go."
<br />

<br />
The Keeper's yellow eyes narrowed.  "First, you will do something for me.  I do not intend to remain in this place any longer, and so…"
<br />

<br />
"I don't give a fucking shit what you intend!  You're a puppet, a fucking imp!  And you're wasting my fucking time!" spat Orbis.  This little intermission was taking too long.  White-hot energy pulsed through his body - years of blood and death consumed - he began to feel himself come apart.  "Your. Business. Gatekeeper." he forced out.  The pain was building, and every word became a struggle.  "I have no patience for your fucking games!" 
<br />

<br />
A rasping laugh.  "You insignificant CARCASS!  You are fucking dirt beneath my foot, and you dare speak to me like an equal.  I can see your lessons will be frequent and painful!”  For all his screaming rage, the Keeper had noticed the slight changes in the form that stood before him, and guessed at once the reason.  Those above him had long been watching this one gain in power -- and that power was known to him.  Doubt began to creep into his mind, and with it came his mistake.  He let it touch his eyes...
<br />
     
<br />
It was over before Orbis became conscious of the Keeper's gory remains dripping from every part of his body.  The energy now ran in searing rivers through his mind and body, crackling around him like lightning.  His breath came in rasping gurgles.  Simply standing upright was a colossal task.  He had seen the doubt in the Keeper's eyes, and he was consumed at once by the thing inside.  Now it dominated his mind, and he began to dwindle, to be absorbed.  The part of him that was still conscious gripped his being in an iron will, and moved forward to stand before the gate.  It did not open.
<br />

<br />
The sound of screaming metal and crumbling stone never reached his consciousness. Nothing remained to him but the roaring in his ears, the white-hot river before his eyes, and the searing pain in his body.  His form crumpled to the stone, well beyond the shattered gate...
<br />

<br />
***
<br />

<br />
Rot.  Pain.  The river of fire coursed through him, and he knew nothing.  All of the destruction, all of the death and slaughter which he had caused, was now consuming him, changing him.  He had basked in the gore of innocents, slaughtered thousands only for the power it created in him.  And that power now ripped him apart, destroyed him.  The pain ceased with the destruction of consciousness, and the creature Orbis was no more. 
<br />
 
<br />
For days it lay still as its wasted flesh dripped slowly to the stones.  What lie beneath was formless, a coalescing mist crackling with energy.  They watched as time slipped by, and puddles of blood and gore became a crust on the stones.  The mist swirled in on itself, crackling and hissing with activity.  Quiet, sickly voices sounded in the shadows, commenting, speculating.  Nothing was more exciting to such as these.
<br />

<br />
Then a pulse.  Light shown through the mist, flickering white.  As the pulse became more steady, it grew.  Swelling into a solid ball of light, it began to spew flames in all directions, expelling energy in an orgasm of power, destroying and consuming those within reach as the fortunate few fled in terror.  The flames roared around the cavern, turning in on themselves and coming together in a blinding flash and giving birth to a mind crushing boom which resounded throughout the region.  
<br />
     
<br />
Rot.  Decay.  Time oozed slowly along like so much spilled blood, viscous, lifeless.   The sticky air roiled with thick, greasy clouds of expelled life, smelling of sulfur and  lingering fear.  The Gates stood silent, a barrier which none could pass.  None but those who had passed before.  Whole again, it stood in the darkness of the silent cavern, the only witness to the birth of a god.  The remains of the unfortunate watchers littered the ground, their gore splattered upon the walls.  Beyond the cavern, more corpses, more blood, more carnage.  The endless path of Caedis, Lord of Slaughter.<br />_________________<br /><img src="http://img74.exs.cx/img74/8985/caedissig.gif" border="0" /></span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>
