         <blockquote>
         It may sound like I have no clue but this was an old post. I have in fact gotten some info on what makes a good guild and I do know what kind of guild or group of players these KAAOS people are. It is about making the game your own and having your own rules or strategy to boot. And it’s about no rules. The kiddies of KAAOS really like that since they can post anything they want. This would be wrong because there could be youngsters that contact this guild and get ideas of profanity and gross taboo words to use. KAAOS makes a bad role model for the majority of gamers that are playing RPG. Making this a public chat would be yet another wrong thing to do when ethics are needed with the Internet. True you get swear words when on the highway of life but this shows how professional gamers have become. In a sentence I would say don’t quit your day job KAAOS. You people are too immature to play a game without swearing or making fun of someone. In every sport there is fighting but that only leads to losing. <P>I don't know how ant saying "This is me being polite. Engage the brain, realize you don't belong here and move on maggot.” would help in this case. <P>The fact that I am learning about every guild that there is and reading before I post does provide proof that I am using the brain and am willing to form a group of players for the common good of the team.  And the other minor fact that this is the public forum part of KAAOS team and have every right to post. I am not trying to be a troll; I am trying to make good productive topics since there are none to begin with. It can be true that KAAOS is trying to be more private and want to keep the gaming secrets away from the competition but this should not be the case since no money is involved. <P>I am NOT fortunate that someone is indeed posting some well thought out sentence structures for me to read. This is because I am used to being "torn to shreds" by at least three members of KAAOS. These members are indeed trolls because they try to start something with nothing added on to prove why this is the reason. For example they may say I am a loser but never give any kind of reason except for not having friends. But do they really know if I have friends or not since this is the Internet? Also, the guild leader has nothing to do with the general forum and is never a contributor with posting ideas. This shows me that this guild is growing stale in comparison to other RPG groupings.<BR>
