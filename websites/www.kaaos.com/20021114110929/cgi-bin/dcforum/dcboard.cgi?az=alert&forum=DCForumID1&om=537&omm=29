Dewd, I think there are like 30 messages above here, where they have all said this you. Please show me where KAAOS has stated they were going to build an Empire? Do you have a NEED to have knuckles rapped against your forward to understand this?

KAAOS is not TCE.
KAAOS plays to kill.

When you are dying in your group to KAAOS members, what are you going to do, respawn at your tree of life, grab your entire city/guild/empire mates to go tear down KAAO's city, ONLY to then discover they do not HAVE a city.

I know I told you this before, go learn a little about KAAOS, you are showing your ignorance. Maybe you just spent to much time in "FICTIONAL FANTASY." Go watch a child's wstern that you can understand. Maybe American Outlaw. Picture KAAOS as the regulators. 

They will harass your supply lines, tear yer city down, and generally gut you in game all just for the fucking fun of it, to see you come onto these boards later and CRY about, and this is what will happen rest assured.

"KAAOS thinks they are so tuff, they killed me ing ame, but can not take what they dished out, because they never built a city, they really suck." I'm not in KAAOS, and you are a dumb fuck who is going to post that exact same message down the road. If not you, some other ignorant fuck just like you, who is to fucking blind by the dic being shoved in his eye as KAAOS skull fucks ya, crying about it.

It's all happened in the past, it's all going to happen again. You are just an amusement, nothing more. And that has already passed.

Div Devlin
