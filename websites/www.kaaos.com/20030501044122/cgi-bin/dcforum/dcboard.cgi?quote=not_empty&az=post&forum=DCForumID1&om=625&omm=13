         I still don't understand why in the world would someone have special places where you can rez your sorry ass. Like Ultima it would be a place where a few guys camp out to rez kill.<P> This would further agitate the player that wants to get back in the game. A mage had no trouble with this, they would hurry to the bank and recall to his house. All that would be needed are regs and a hourse along with traped pouches and maybe some magic cloths and potions. A fighter would have to equip a weapon and bandages and then run to another store to get the damn horse. All along hoping he would not get killed in the process.<P>In Neocron they have less penalties. You can keep you weapon, buy back your armor and other junk, and be replicated to any gene replication area after death. The only down side is the belt which can be hacked but most people dont have the skill. That is the only object you have to go back for. In Ultima you rarely got your junk back since most people could loot in a split second.<P>In checkers you can exchange a piece for a king. In chess you can get your weapon back if you cross the board with a pawn. Ultima Online would not consider changing the rule with being able to keep a weapon when being killed unless you spend a hell of a long time getting a bless item for it. If a 5 time gm got that then a 7 time gm would be useless.
