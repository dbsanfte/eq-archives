Ok.<P>A) The trap was set for anyone, it just so happened that you fell for it THREE times in a row. After I saw what a noobler you were I couldn't resist at that point.<BR>B) Had I known you were a 10 yr. old and/or mentally disabled as you now seem, I wouldn't have bothered with the taunting and repeated gankings.<BR>C) Posting here did nothing to remove the no-skill moron tag.  I honestly don't know wtf you think it accomplished.<BR>D) He is not the first worshipper, the others were just....in the closet. <P>That is all.<P>Rit

Laff...<P>Your selective memory amuses me. The first time we ever fought you lag-killed me a few and had some strong finishes.<P>The next time I ran into you the pwnage was laid down by me, not just in kills, but in a higher score as well. <P>On top of that I seem to remember you 0-9 at one point lol. ;-P <P>Joker_01 you have skills, but 1 v 1 infantry I have transcended you.<P>Rit  <P>
