----------------------------------------------------
To be honest I'm disappointed with the lack of PvP so far on this server, TZ was much more ambitious starting out.  I almost feel like I'm playing a bluebie server, which makes me wonder why I'm not playing with my RL friends on Fennin instead.

I'm not because TCE has a chance to play a game together in decent numbers, and there is a *possiblity* albeit unfortunately slim, that we will get a chance to PvP as a team.  Everytime I have engaged in PvP on SZ so far it has been by myself or helping out an anonymous ally who's getting picked on.  Every single time the enemy has run away and opted to zone rather than deal with the consequences of their actions.

PvP will be much less restricted and much more rewarding in SB, so hopefully these same problems won't persist there.  I never had any hope of EQ being a great PvP stage but for now it's the only thing in which we can gather together in numbers.  Personally, I'm not going to even hope of participating in this level 50+ PvP game of server domination KAAOS is striving for, because if SB isn't at least out in my beta stage by then I will have had my fill of what SZ has to offer nevertheless.  I don't think anyone in TCE is planning for that either.  That said, it as though we are playing 2 entirely different games, and 2 entirely different strategies just make sense for what we are trying to achieve.  In SB I see where KAAOS' SZ strategy would be good for just about any war-minded guild planning to stick it out for the long-haul there, hampered only by the fact that none of us will know SB's advancement process nearly as well as EQ's.

This argument over nutsacks and strategy is pointless.  One is not better than the other; our strategies match our goals.  They both suit both our needs, that's what a strategy is used for.
