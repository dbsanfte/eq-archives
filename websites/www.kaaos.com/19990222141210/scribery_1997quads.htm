          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><b>Death by KAAOS</b><br>
            Kal Mirage - War Knight - Ego Prime - Xylina<br>
            </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><br>
            As darkness began to fall over the realms, with it, the sounds of 
            the creatures of the night began to grow louder. The sounds of men 
            hunting the dangerous creatures and beasts, the sounds of the these 
            beasts hunting the men, the sounds of battle, the sounds of pain, 
            the sounds of bloodshed, and most importantly, the sounds of evil 
            deeds in progress. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Amongst these 
            sounds, one other distinct and unmistakable sound could be heard.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> The sound of 
            KAAOS.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> Their group, 
            consisting of seven Gods and one Goddess, was on the prowl. Whereever 
            they went, death followed close behind. A trail of bloody footprints 
            could be seen marking the soft earth of the Neverwinter Woods as the 
            group moved away from the scene of another of their merciless slaughters.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> As they moved 
            away from the carnage, everyone turned to glance back at their work 
            one last time.. a pile of six mutilated corpses.. two of them charred 
            beyond recognition, and one no more than a pile of bones and ashes. 
            Puddles of blood pooled on the ground around the bodies and all around, 
            rocks and trees were spotted with the crimson red droplets of these 
            unfortunate travellers. One of the corpses clothes seemed to be missing 
            also, the result of some perverted act also.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> The group of 
            KAAOSers began moving on, but for some reason, Slayve was eyeing War 
            Knight and his face was twisted into a demonic looking sneer. The 
            two had a few words and then Slayve pushed War Knight away and they 
            began heading back to the KAAOS Hell Hole.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
            </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Once back at 
            the Hell Hole, everyone began bragging about their take of Souls for 
            the evening. The Dreadlord was fiddling with his serrated dagger and 
            slashing across the air, reenacting a morbid scene in front of the 
            kneeling slaves, ITB Legion and ITB Silver.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> In the middle 
            of the large hall, though, War Knight and Slayve were pushing each 
            other again. They were yelling back and forth about who had rights 
            to the soul of one of the wusses they had killed. As the pushes became 
            shoves, the rest of the room began to break up into two factions around 
            the two bickering Gods.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> Kal Mirage, 
            Ego Prime and Xylina all moved behind War Knight, while Sir Rellik, 
            Tyo Ark and Krynal gather behind Slayve. Then everyone began yelling 
            back and forth at everyone else soon enough everyone was pushing everyone. 
            Just as it seemed as if it was about to come to some nice honest fighting 
            to settle the dispute, War Knight raised his hand and spoke in his 
            loud booming voice, "There is only one way to settle this.."</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> Turning, he 
            pointed to the corner where a large keg of his finest ale sat. Everyone 
            traded looks of confusion until War threw a large mug at Slayve. The 
            demon God snatched the mug out of the air and pushed his way through 
            the mass of KAAOSers, but instead of tapping the keg, he just looked 
            at his mug.. and it filled with a dark murky liquid with tendril of 
            smoke rising off of it. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Everyone began 
            to understand and they all fetched different liquids and substances, 
            mugs, shot glasses, and the like. Within seconds, shots were being 
            downed, new kegs were being tapped, people were yelling back and forth 
            and slamming their mugs down as they called for the slaves to bring 
            them more.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> ITB Legion hurriedly 
            supplied the Dreadlord's team with more drinks, while ITB Silver ran 
            back and forth trying to keep all of Kal's team's glasses full. Insults 
            were being thrown every which way, along with empty mugs and other 
            containers. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Then the first 
            casualties began to occurr. Xylina threw down three more shots of 
            a red, glowing liquid, but then she started to fall back in her chair. 
            The sound of Sir Rellik laughing at her, "Heh! Heh!," brought her 
            back to her senses long enough for her to shoot him an icy stare and 
            hurl all three shot glasses, in succession, at the Dreadlord's head. 
            One after another, all three hit Rellik right in between the eyes. 
            Then in unison, the both of them fell to the floor, slipping under 
            the table.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> Next to go was 
            Tyo Ark. After having downed another mug of War's ale, he leaned back 
            in his chair, two feet off the ground, then he belched. The walls 
            shook with the might of his expulsion of the gaseous bubble in his 
            stomach. The force of the vibrations caused his chair to rock back 
            and his head slammed against the stone floor. His eyes rolled back 
            into his head and blood started pooring from his nose.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> Followed by 
            the vibrations of his belch, was a hideous odor. Everyone else's noses 
            furrowed and tehy shook it off. All except War Knight, who was holding 
            a large keg of ale of his head and chugging it. The foul odor caused 
            his knees to buckle and he fell to the floor. The keg slipped from 
            his hands and came crashing down right on his head, then he flopped 
            to the floor with a thump, his head buried inside the keg.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> Slayve started 
            to smirk and called Ego over for a moment. Ego wondered what was going 
            on but followed anyways. Then Slayve bent over and another loud noise 
            rocked the Hell Hole, followed by an even fouler odor. Kal and Krynal 
            dove under the tables to stay out of the direct path of the very deadly 
            cloud of gas that had been created. Ego Prime couldnt escape though. 
            He inhaled deeply and the fell face first to the ground, landing right 
            on top of ITB Silver. Ego pinned her to the ground and held her there 
            as he slipped into consciousness.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> Slayve, however, 
            let out another loud sound, however this time it was more than just 
            gas. With a pained look on his face, he ran from the room, howling 
            and swearing in some sort of harsh demonic tongue. As the air cleared 
            and the smell disipated, only Kal Mirage and Krynal remained. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Both of these 
            two gods kept slammed down mugs of ale and shots of powerful soulspritzers. 
            Many times it looked as if Kal was about to fall back in his chair, 
            but he kept holding his own against Krynal. Then when it seemed like 
            neither of them would ever succumb to the liquor, Krynal started to 
            cough and sputter, then ducked his head under the table.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> Kal Mirage slammed 
            down one last drink as Krynal continued to puke and vomit all over 
            the Hell Hole floor. When the sounds of his puking stopped, he just 
            collapsed under the table. Kal then stood up and raised his mug, proclaiming 
            their victory to his fallen comrades. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">He then walked 
            over and lifted his passed out wife into his arms, then grabbed a 
            bottle of some blue liquid and headed off into the slightly cleaner 
            and less smelling confines of the Hell Hole, leaving a room full of 
            drunken, passed out Gods under the table. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">As Kal carried 
            Xylina into his chambers and flopped her down onto the bed, the only 
            other sounds he could hear throughout the Hell Hole were the sounds 
            of ITB Silver pleaing for help and Slayve growling in frustration 
            as he ran back and forth down the hallway every few moments, followed 
            by a disgusting fecal odor. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">~~~~~~~~~~~~~
