<blockquote>I was on a raid in EQ (Tarew Marr server) and ran into a level 50+ cleric named Kaaos.  I asked him if he had any ties to the Guild.  I'd run into a guy named Malhavok about a year ago but he claimed he'd never heard of him.<P>Anyway, I kid you not, the guy said:<P>"I don't know anyone in that guild but that's were I got the name <img src="http://www.kaaos.com/htdocs/dcforum/Images/happy.gif">"<P>(screen caps available on request)<P>I told him he was a bit pathetic in taking his name from someone else's guild.  He tried to weasel out of the statement, but I'd already captured it on a cap, so I didn't let him slide.<P>Thought you guys would get a kick out of it.<P>~f</blockquote><hr><b><font size=2>Table of contents</font></b><hr>

On Povar, there was a human SK named Relik. He acted like an idiot, every tell I sent him was responded by mindless dribble. Yes, I know this is the real Rel.<P>Zerackus<BR>KAAOS Ass Kicker
