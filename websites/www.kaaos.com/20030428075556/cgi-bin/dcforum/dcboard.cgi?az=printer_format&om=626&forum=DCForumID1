<blockquote>Some of you may have known me as Messer from EQ tallon zek server a while ago.  Me and some of my old buddies are going to be playing shadowbane and I was trying to hook back up with the guys I used to hunt with...benign, galorious, mothball, etc....  Also was wondering what had been organized so for for a KAAOS SB guild.  Thanks<P></blockquote><hr><b><font size=2>Table of contents</font></b><hr>

Sup Messer...This is Kad...i lurk these boards now and again to see if anyone i know shows up....gnorn did a while back.<P>I am in Shadowbane beta right now....though still killing stupid AI mobs at the moment trying to level up so i can check out the real deal.<P>Leveling is pretty quick....at least sub 20....which is where im still at. Once you get the feel of the game....with a good group ou could level to 20 in a weekend pretty easy. i went from level 6 to 17 in about 7 hours of playtime or so....and thats with me looking around for groups and stuff.<P>actually im kinda interested whether or not KAAOS is planning on checking this game out. I had thought they were in  beta....but havent seen dick about it on the boards...but then...i just read the general forum every now and then. I kinda got the impression they just kinda gave up on the game after all the delays. <P>Though I did see a post recently on SB beta boards by Hedron....so who knows.<P>Last i heard Benign was without internet....but thats been a while. Joker i think is playing BF 1942 and i have not seen or heard about Pig or Galorious.<P>As far as Shadowbane goes...if it lives up to the crap i read by Bonedancer....I think it might be a good game. Will find out more as i get further along in beta.<P>If it does turn out good....I'd be happy to hook up with any of the old WB and kick some ass, or for that matter ...any KAAOS'ers that end up playing it. Though I  only know the same guys you do from KAAOS.<P><BR>Keep in touch with me as it gets closer to release at Tusc@cox.net and we will see what happens.<P><P>Tusc<BR>aka Kadaji<BR>

We probly have 8-10 people who play SB, most of those just occasionally because this build is pretty fucked up.  Lock ups and freezes and lag keep most of us from playing.  Those who do meander through all that crap, are currently running with The Rolling 30's.  Lot of talk on the mail string about MOO by Joker and pig.  I'll tell them to drop by the boards here.<P>Rann<BR>KAAOS

Last time I checked about three months ago Shadowbane had a freeze issue with four or more mages casting at the same time. I am not sure if they fixed it or not. <P>Gods Wrath Clan has SB and SWG back on their forum since both are being played via internet soon.<P>Both games rely on “clan” numbers for the simple fact that you will have to rely upon other players to get supplies. Since the number of characters that can be created is one per server on SWG. The only other way to add another character for your fighting force is to buy another account. This makes it important to gather up people you can trust with different special skills. It is possible to get special weapons from other factions with SWG if you have the smuggling skill. If different factions can trade without killing each other at a neutral zone then this should not be a huge problem.  For example if no one in your clan has a designer to make your next weapon then the constructor has to look around for one which might take a long time.

What's up Messer.  Shin, Cen, Moth, etc. I will try to get in touch with everyone if shadowbane doesn't end up a total piece of shit.  I'm not really interested in getting into the beta, but will play the "finished" product.  Send Tusc an email and he will give you mine.  Not sure if Benign@kaaos.com works.<P>I am currently playing Magic Online and MoO3.<P>Benign

Yo Benign still no email addy that works. Looks like several of the old gang is gonna be playing shadowbane....could have used another month or so in beta but they shipped it. Holding out hope that they get the server stability stuff in order fairly soon. <P>bottom line for me is its a pretty fun game and it doesnt take long to level. if i gotta wade through some stability issues for a bit i'll live with it as long as it gets better pretty soon.<P>email me and let me know whats up<P>Tusc
