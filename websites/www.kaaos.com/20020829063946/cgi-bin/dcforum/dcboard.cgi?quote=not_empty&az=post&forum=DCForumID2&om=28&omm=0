         <blockquote>
         Down a hallway, around a bend, down a long shaft, and behind locked doors a God has slumbered for what seems an eternity. He awakens to find his chambers dusty and unkempt, rubbing his eyes he silently says "damn what happened to my slaves" and looking around the room he sees a pair of legs hanging from above the headboard minus the rest of the body. "Well now.... dont remember THAT happening." -shrugs- "oh well time for some new ones" <P>   As he rubs his face a smirk appears and a glimmer returns to his eye. "Ahh yes it is time to refill the hot tub anew"<P>   A family sits in the middle of a forest not far from thier home, enjoying a beautiful afternoon and having a wonderful picnic, the laughs of the child can be heard around the forest. The mother calls for the child to return to the picnic site and enjoy the food she had worked so dilligently to prepare. Then suddenly the laughter stops, all noise in the forest stops.<BR>A cold chill overcomes the man of the family as he fears that something ill has befallen his daughter. They quickly devise a plan to search the area where the girls laughter had been heard, and as they prepared to mobilize and search they hear a cackle and before they can even process what theyve heard a drip of blood falls on the mothers cheek as they look up a bag falls from the sky soaked with blood from the bottom to mid way up the bag. The woman starts to sob tears of fear and pain for she is sure what the bag contains. She slowly undoes the purple silk ribbon that holds the top of the bag closed and peers down in sheer horror as her eyes confirm what her mind has already told her. She looks to her husband with a blank expression and slowly begins to rise taking hold of what was in the bag and as she ascends the bag falls away reavealing thier precious daugthers head minus her body with a crescent moon carved into her forehead.<BR>    The man begins to run to and fro sobbing and weeping uncontrollably finally falling to the ground and shaking a fist at the heavens he yells "Gods why have you forsaken me, why must you take what little your servants have" he looks to his wife who stands there motionless holding the head of their daughter in the cradle of her bossom. She looks to him with startled eyes and she tries to speak but no words leave her lips. He rises from the ground to ask what ails her but as he rises she begins to fall revealing her reason for sudden muteness as behind her stands a figure garmeted in obsidian black armor with a crescent moon crest and a black hood. an eight inch blade drips warm blood from the second victims freshly pierced lung and back. A toothy smile can be seen beneath the hood. <P>       Fear overcomes the man he is suddenly unable to move. Panic controls his legs as they quiver, shake, and begin to reveal just how scared he is by the puddle forming by his foot.<BR>        The dark clad individual cackles at the sight of the man wetting himself, and stradles the mans dying wife and carves a crescent moon into her forehead as well. The man is still unable to move as he weeps like a child. The Darkness moves towards him in a slow confident stride, standing right in front of the man he leans forward to whisper into his ear....<P>    "The Sleeper Has awakened.... I am the darkness, I have taken your wife, I have taken your child, and all you could do to stop me was to make me laugh myself to death by the sight of your weak bladder. I have no use of your soul today you are far too weak to be taken by me. I am going to let you live with the knowledge that your wife and child died under your assumed protection, and that somewhere out there is the God who did it, and as a reminder you will bear my mark until the day you die, thereby letting everyone know if they harm you they have to answer to me. And no one wants to answer to a KAAOS GOD. Wheeeeeeeeeee!!"<BR>   <BR>        The man walks the realms today a hollow and empty vessel with the scar of the crescent moon on his forhead, the only words he mutters are "the darkness took my family" <P>The Sleeper has awakened.... <P>-=KAAOSDEATH=-<BR>The Darkness
