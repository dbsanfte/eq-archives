<P><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=+1>Meat Puppet Theater is a proud KAAOS&nbsp;tradition
where those who seek to challenge the Gods of KAAOS undoubtedly wind up.
&nbsp;There's usually a &quot;bet&quot;&nbsp;or a &quot;Deathmatch&quot;
involved between the challenger and a KAAOS&nbsp;member. Invariably the
losers wind up here for the amusement of the KAAOS&nbsp;Gods and Goddesses.
&nbsp;Enjoy Meat Puppet Theater. ;)</FONT></FONT>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#800000">Subj: The Meat Puppet Date: 96-02-10 11:29:54
EST </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">From: Hedron</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#800000">Hedron and his meat puppet, Kaelith, wound
their way down the narrow and jagged hallway, more like a split in the
living stone than anything created by man.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#800000">Hedron's long stride soon takes them back out
into a cavernous and more normal hallway (for the Hell Hole), and right
up to a small, fire blackened door. Without breaking stride, as the walk
up to it, a finger on Hedron's left hand twitches, and the door flies open.
They march in.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#800000">They march in.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#800000">My God, what in all the HELLS do they march
into? This one room is some kind of twisted reality. Some kind of gross
warped joke played on the essence of life. The Main Pit had been a sight,
but this? This was painful for Kaelith to look at. Except he couldn't NOT
look at it. There was no light in the room. Not a shred except for what
beamed in through the doorway from the flickering torches in the hall.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#800000">But somehow, that didn't matter. Even without
the light, the contents of this room burned into your brain. The room echoed
with such pain and hurt that it needed no light to push itself into your
head like a branding iron.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#800000">And no blinking of eyes, no covering of faces,
no hiding could shut it out!</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#800000">It didn't seem to bother Hedron. In fact, he
didn't even seem to notice. As he walked into the room, the Twisted Cross
of the False Prophet of KAAOS rose into the air and beamed a dark and evil
light around the room. It silhoueted an evil sleeping form stretched out
on a blood stained table. Again without breaking stride, Hedron's foot
rose up in a vicious kick, that slammed the table out from under its occupant,
crashing it into a wall and splintering half of it into sawdust.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#800000">In the same moment, Hedron's voice rang out,
&quot;Malhavok, get up you sleeping worthless curr! It's time for my meat
puppet's check up!&quot;</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#800000">This was Malhavok's Lab. Once Doc Krypto's.
A legacy of pain and death hung in the room like a thick, oily, evil smoke.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#800000">Malhavok's body, of course, was undisturbed
by the destruction of the table, or the ear-piercing yell of The False
Prophet. He hung there in mid-air as though nothing had happened. With
a slow stretch, he turned and sat up, placing his feet on the floor. Seeming
to take no notice that there was no table to be sitting on.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#800000">&quot;Hedron, anybody ever tell you that you
don't sleep enough?&quot; growled out Mal.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#800000">Ignoring the comment, Hedron turned and swung
the Twisted Cross, embedding one tine of it into the solid stone wall.
It flared into brightness, lighting the rest of the horrid room as Hedron
plopped down into a chair.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#800000">&quot;As expected, I slaughtered the mortal,
Kaelith, in a Deathmatch, Mal. And I cast the spells and rituals as you
instructed to breathe life into him. All is as you predicted. He serves
as a half-aware Zombie, able to initiate his own actions, yet unable to
resist my instruction when I give them.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#800000">&quot;I have brought him here for you to test
the bindings that hold his life in his body, despite the magic of the Deathmatch
chamber. And I have brought him here for you to test the binding that hold
his will in my grip. Malhavok, will it last a full cycle of the moon as
you said before he dies?&quot;</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#800000">Kaelith the Meat Puppet stood drooling and
idle, listening to the words of the Twisted Cross wielder, but unable to
resent them.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#800000">Mal, with an evil smile, stood and stepped
toward the slave. - Hedron False Prophet of KAAOS</FONT></B>

21:25:17 EST </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">From: Malhavok</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#800000">&quot;Well now&quot;, said the tall, bearded,
tall man to Kaelith, &quot;I was wondering when you would be by for your...&quot;check
up&quot;.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#800000">Malhavok let out a long, loud laugh and took
the Kaelith Meat Puppet by the arm and dragged him to a large device that
looked like a very large, bean beag chair. It was rather uneven shaped,
but looked quite comfortable. The only feature that made it look different
was a rather &quot;watery&quot; consitancy it had. It looked as if you
sat in it, you'd fall right through.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#800000">Mal pushed the Meat Puppet into the chair.
Kaelith relaxed for a moment, but suddenly the chair started to envelope
him. His body shimmered INTO the chair and his face contorted in pain,
as his molecules and being forged itself with the chair. Arms turned rubbery,
legs became ooze and melded into the chair. In a matter of 10 seconds,
Kaelith had BECOME the chair.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#800000">Hedron gave a smirk, from his position a few
feet away, and laughed at Mal's little creation. A small face, contorted
in agony looked out from the chair, it's eyes pleading.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#800000">&quot;Oh, but there's more&quot; said Malhavok,
as he unceremoniously plopped his frame onto the Kaelith Chair. A muffeled
&quot;Uuuuuurrgh!&quot; was barely audible from the chair as Mal got comfy
in his new seat. Mal shifted in the Kaelith Chair a bit then said, &quot;Ahhh...glad
I had an extra serving of Legion's +3 chili this evening&quot;. He smiled
at Heddie and lifted slightly off the chair.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#800000">&quot;OH&nbsp;GOD, MAL...NO!!!!&quot; shouted
Hedron as he dove for cover and tried to shield himself from the forthcoming
blast, but it was too late.</FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#800000">Subj: Meat Puppet in the Lab II Date: 96-02-10
21:27:52 EST </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">From: Malhavok</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#800000">The Goddess V1xen, who was artfully removing
the heart of a KEF'er Paladin she had captured the night before, was a
mere 50 yards from Mal's Lab. The explosion shook her from her delicate
work and she slipped, plunging the dagger deep into the bowels of the startled
KEF'er, splattering blood on her royal Drow gown. &quot;Damn it!&quot;
she shouted as she ripped the dagger out of the KEF'ers guts as they poured
forth onto the cold floor. She left the dead KEF'er and stormed down the
hallway to Mal's lab. Poison was in her eyes, and inflicting pain for ruining
her KEF'er, was on her mind.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#800000">She approached the door to Mal's lab. It had
been ripped from it's hinges. She got within 10 feet of the door and staggered
against the wall, at the HORRID stench emanating from the bowels of Mal's
Lab. &quot;Lloth preserve me!&quot; she shouted and ran towards the HotTub
room to wretch.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#800000">NiteRage, Azimer and War Knight who were sparring
in a large room not from the lab, caught the smell as it raged it's way
through the Hell Hole. They were all in mid-cast, when the stench entered
the room. They both looked at each other for a moment, then ran screaming
for the window at the far end of the hall. One raced the other for the
window and they all crashed through it at the same time to the blessedly
scentless moat below.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#800000">Meanwhile, down in the Lab, Hedron who had
been knocked momentarily unconscious from the blast, picked himself off
the floor and made his way over to where his Meat Puppet lay. His Meat
Puppet was back to normal it seemed, but Kaelith, curled into a fetal position,
only wimpered as he approached. Malhavok was nowhere to be found, but a
note lay next to Kaelith.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#800000">&quot;Yer Meat Puppet is fine, Heddy. Your
Spell of Will Binding will hold until the next full moon. I hope you don't
mind him smelling more like a &quot;Spoiled Meat Puppet&quot;, but somehow,
I don't think you will&quot;. ;)</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#800000">Hedron looked down at Kaelith who was still
curled into a little ball, eyes closed, clawing helplessy at the air. Hedron
laughed a cruel laugh, put one hand over his nose and mouth and grabbed
his Meat Puppet by the neck. He hauled him off to his next destination.</FONT></B></P>

Kaelith</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#800000">Kaelith scampered through the hell hole, looking
to and fro for the KAAOS Drugstore. His wide eyes and puppet-like movements
made him an odd sight in that hellish abyss. Puppet-like? No, it was just
his sore bum. While he scooted along, he repeated, over and over, faster
and faster, the first few lines of a song that just would NOT leave his
stupified brain.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#800000">&quot;I'm a little meat puppet, short and stout
Hed's arm's up my arse and it moves my mouth&quot;</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#800000">Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, he squeeked with every
footfall. Wheres that Drugstore?!</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#800000">Ouchouchouchouch!</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#800000">At last he came to it....&quot;Doc Krypto's
Drugstore.....Where euphoria is your best cure.&quot; A great sigh passed
his lips as a bead of sweat dripped off his nose. Rows and rows of cases
filled the place, but there didnt seem to be a clerk about! The Meat Puppet
stood in the center of the huge drugstore and danced about, holding his
bum. &quot;Hello?&quot;, he squeeked. No answer. &quot;Hello?!?!&quot;
He pulled himself up the counter and peered over the top (The gods sure
are tall;x) Noone. He walked over to one of the cases and pressed his tiny
face against the glass. Inside were nothing but boxes and boxes of Preparation
H!! &quot;Yeaaah!&quot;, he cried out and clapped his little hands. Quickly
he ran over and tugged on the handle. It was locked! His face fell and
he jumped back. Getting a little run going, he smacked himself off the
glass. It wouldnt break! Suddenly a fear gripped him, and he looked about,
weeping. Just then, Heddies voice filled the Hell Hole with a great and
uproarious laughter.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#800000">And the Meat Puppet cried some more.</FONT></B></P>

<HR WIDTH="100%"></P>

<P><B><I><FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><FONT SIZE=+3>ITB&nbsp;Circe</FONT></FONT></I></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#800000">As the final blow was dealt, Circe stared at
the figure she had been fighting. Throughout the entire fight she had seen
an evil in him that she had seen in no other man she had ever come across.
As she fell to the ground a shiver went thru her body knowing exactly what
was to come.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#800000">He came closer to her and bent down just as
she hit. Out of Circe's mouth came her true name. With an evil roar of
laughter, Hedron touched Circe's hair and became one with her. A feeling
began to go thru her body, one that she was sure she would never recover
from.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#800000">In a stunned state after being healed, Circe
headed back to the place where she had done battle with Hedron, her master.
She no longer thought of Hedron as a mere mortal which she had once believed
him to be. She now thought of him as her master and god.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#800000">Shaking her head, she tried to get that vision
out of her mind. As she drew closer she saw the same crowd of people which
had been there to watch the battle. Looking thru the crowd of people, Circe
saw a smirk, Hedron's smirk, and his evil dark eyes. Without him even speaking
she knew to go to him, to be by his side. As she stood beside him she felt
his massive arms engulf her body, pulling her close. He explain to her
in a whisper that she would be his pet, but more then that, his puppet,
to say as he wished her to say, and do as he wished her to do.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#800000">And so began Circe's night in hell.....</FONT></B>

<HR WIDTH="100%"></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#800000">Subj: Re: The time is now.... Date: 96-03-23
15:41:16 EST </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">From: ITB Circe</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#800000">The night air outside the hell hole was filled
with its usual foul stench. Only so much blood can slick the walls of a
pit like this before the stench starts to show. But the Gods of KAAOS paid
it no mind. To them the corrupt smell of death was just the sweet air of
home.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#800000">Inside, it was the night of gathering. The
Gods were arriving in their usual haphazard manner, flashing in from thin
air, blasting in through a hole blown in the raw stone, staggering in drunken
from the outside, or even just waking up from the floor they had passed
out on the night before. Screams of mortals being tortured for pleasure
in the background filled the ears for miles around. Any half-sensitive
mage could feel the magical presence from across the realms and stayed
clear.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#800000">THIS my eager readers was the KAAOS Hell Hole.
A coming together of evil that cannot be ignored. Cannot be forbidden.
Cannot be contained. But you know that. You've all dreamt about being God-like
enough to attend and survive.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#800000">Tonight was a little different, though. Tonight,
Hedron (one of the more ancient and powerful of the Gods) had promised
to re-open his infamous &quot;Meat Puppet Theater.&quot; But not a word
was spoken of who he had wrested a soul from.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#800000">The carousing reached epic heights as it does
at every Hell Hole. Gobbets of torn out flesh flew through the air, dripping
blood on those beneath its path and evil laughter rang from every wall.
Magical energies buffeted the Gods as they slammed bolt after bolt of raw
power into each other as minor disagreements flared into death struggles.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#800000">But this was the way of the immortals.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#800000">Still, up to this point, all was as usual.
It was in the moment that Hedron, cloaked in black and grey, walked phased
into the air near the mouth of the Hell Hole that things became unusual.
A quiet... or at least what passes for one in the Hell Hole... descended
upon the crowd.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#800000">Hedron stood in front of all, capturing the
attention of the killers by his silence. A smug little grin tainted his
lips.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#800000">&quot;LADIES AND GENTELE-IMMORTALS! TONIGHT,
AS PROMISED, MEAT PUPPET THEATER WILL BE PUTTING ON A SPECIAL PERFORMANCE!
FOR THE AMUSEMENT OF THE GODS AND GODDESSES, I PRESENT----</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#800000">ITB CIRCE IN HER DEBUT PERFORMANCE OF THE MEAT
PUPPET THEATER!!!&quot;</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#800000">With a flash, Hedron disappeared, and the doors
at the mouth of the Hell Hole slowly began to drift open. Darkness lay
beyond and courtesy of Hedron's magics, not even the eyes of the immortals
could penetrate that darkness. From somewhere inside of it a woman's hand
pushed its way out. Grabbing the edge of one door the figure pulled itself
into the light.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#800000">Tanned and oiled flesh began at the tip of
her toes. The Gods' eyes difted slowly up her shapely leg, tracing the
curves over her flat belly, over her breasts, and up the face of one of
a member of the only guild in the realms to even pretend to compete with
the Gods of KAAOS.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#800000">Writhing and and slithering to some inner song
that none but she could hear, Circe danced her way into the great hall.
The torch light shined off the hot oils that had been applied to every
inch of her, and her lush body undulated beneath the scraps of clothing
that Hedron had applied to her like garnishes on a meal. Her blonde hair
was brushed forward, partially hiding her face. This was the only sign
of the shame that must have been tormenting her in the inner secret portion
of her will that Hedron did not own completely through the ritual of her
True Name.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#800000">From a dark corner in the back Malhavok, former
GM of KAAOS, watched the little scene as Circe's body (as controlled by
Hedron) serpentined past the tables of drunken Gods. Hedron mysteriously
appeared in even deeper shadows behind Malhavok, unnoticed at first. He
leaned forward with a grin.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#800000">&quot;Mal, how do you like my little puppet?&quot;
whispered Hedron. His expression was gleefull at the thought of what he
was making her do... what he would make her do still. His eyes held that
sick shine that they always manifested as he walked into his torture rooms.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#800000">&quot;She's... suitable, Hedron,&quot; whispered
the ancient evil back. He paused, diabolical thought racing across his
expression. &quot;You must understand I can give you no true opinion without
closer observation. Much closer. Perhaps in my lab.&quot;</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#800000">&quot;Certainly, Malhavok. And before the night
is done, I can say that she will be available for close observation. She'll
be visiting your lab. Of that you should have no doubt.&quot; With a tight
little smile Hedron leaned back into the shadows and disappeared again.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#800000">And the spectacle went on....</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#800000">the spectacle went down...</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#800000">And hope died in Circe's breast as she became
the plaything of the cruelest being she had ever known.</FONT></B>
