Well, I was bored so I read that piece of crap article you linked to. If that article is your guide to evil, then I understand why you are so confused. Kmicic has no idea what evil is, he is merely another child who got picked on in RL and wants to take revenge on people in a fantasy world. He's just another lost soul, and soul snatching is not my department.

What he calls evil, I call petty tricks. His god of evil would be something like Loki of norse mythology. Loki is all about tricking people; not nice but not evil. Loki is nothing compared to the devil of the christian religion, pure evil. Evil in a MMORPG is an emulation and/or recreation of the devil. Save the petty tricks of Loki for the children. These griefers that you call evil cannot put fear into me, they cannot even earn my respect, they are not evil.

The makers of that site are also very misguided children. Peglegboy writes a low-IQ but correct comparison of PvE and PvP and somehow the makers of that site decided to call it "Good or Evil in other words PK or not to PK." They don't understand PvP, they don't understand that some of the most ferocious and zealous fighters are on the side of good. PvE is not 'good', it can barely even be considered roleplaying. PvP is not 'bad', it is an important aspect of roleplaying at its most basic level. That basic level is conflict and only through conflict can good or evil (the fundamental players in roleplay) exist.

Me, I think of myself as neutral. I am the god of death and decay. If I happen to help people along on their way to death, there's nothing wrong with that is there? If I happen to love the smell of the rotting carcasses of all those who fight, whether good, neutral, or evil; it doesn't make me evil, does it? If I happen to lose my mortal life and be banished back to the life of a god, it's not evil for me to enjoy watching my possessed bloated corpse rot on the battlefield, is it? If I happen to kill my allies just to watch them decay, that's not evil is it? People run in terror from me as I bring them death. That is my enjoyment. That is my immortal life. That is me. So it can't be evil, can it? You see, I am merely neutral.
