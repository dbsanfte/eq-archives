You are god damn right I said not to zone out. It’s about zone control you dumbfuck. The report I had was there were around 30 nuets  AT the zone line. I’ve been in COUNTLESS battles for zone control and once another team holds a line it is stupid to zone into it, especially if you are zoning into the unknown. We do not need someone zoning out by themselves because they are “curious” and sucking a stupid death before their character is even back under their control. 

You want an example of this? Zone into my line fuck. We will chew your gimp asses up before you even have a chance to pull your head out of your ass. 

Some battles are won without screen caps. They wanted Befallen, we held our line. We were preping up and finding out how many people were were on the other side of the zone line. They poked in, saw us and backed out immediately, and then abandoned their line. I’m not your fairy god damn grandmother and I don’t give a fuck if you are being slaughtered. I’m not gonna run to save your gimp ass in WC. I don’t give a fuck about WC unless I’m in it. But someone comes into MY zone, they will be slaughtered. 

After it was evident that nobody was going to contest us for our zone we moved back in deeper to xp. Meanwhile, all you little gnats hiding behind our ranks were saved from a Nuet invasion. You can post your thank you’s at www.fuckoff.com
