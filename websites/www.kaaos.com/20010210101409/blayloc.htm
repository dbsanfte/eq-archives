                  <td height="600">  <P align=left> &nbsp;&nbsp;Gaming Utopia: Will it Exist? </P>
              <P align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;Has anyone ever thought about where MMORPG's 
                are going today? Are they progressing or are they on a downward 
                spiral that will eventually lead to the death of online gaming 
                as we know it? </P>
              <P align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it is the latter. </P>
              <P align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very harsh statement, but I 
                will explain to you now why this "Utopian Game," the pot of gold 
                at the end of every gamers rainbow, will NEVER be born. It is 
                the masses upon masses of IDIOTS and c001 dUd3s that are running 
                rampant in every online game today. It is the droves of preschoolers 
                running around defacing Massive Multi-user Online ROLE-PLAYING 
                Games. I almost think that the TV Raters have a good idea. Rate 
                Video games, anything that requires an Adult rating, should only 
                be played by Mature adults. Sorry Kids, the playground is closed.</P>
              <P align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp; Role-play in today's Online ROLE-PLAYING 
                Games is not existent. This is due to the overwhelming rush of 
                underage gamers. "Role-playing is Gey0r" Is imagination a thing 
                of the past? What people don't understand is that role-play is 
                not a bad thing.. it doesn't take away from the enjoyment of the 
                game. It GREATLY enhances it. </P>
              <P align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't like to role-play, why do you 
                want to make me. Go play on a Blue (non-PVP) server if you want 
                to role-play." </P>
              <P align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever I hear this statement. I want 
                to grab the person who said it, turn them upside down, and ram 
                their head into the ground until their eyes pop out. This has 
                got to be the most absurd statement anyone playing a MMORPG can 
                ever utter. PvP (Player vs. Player) is dependent upon Role-play, 
                and Role-play is dependent upon PvP. You CANNOT have one without 
                the other. Well.. that is a bold statement.. but the first is 
                true. You cannot have PvP without Role-play. Without role-play.. 
                PvP becomes Pk'ing (Player Killing) </P>
              <P align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;OH my.. (gasps) I said the "Pee-Kay" word. 
                There is a HUGE difference in the two. They are not the same. 
                I get equally upset when someone calls me a PK'er. I am not a 
                friggin PK'er, I have never been a PK'er, and I will never be 
                a PK'er. For the last 10+ years, I have role-played that same 
                character, the same way, and have done the same things. I kill 
                people because I am evil. I role-play an evil character that thrives 
                on the destruction of everything and everyone around him. One 
                of the other problems I see with games today is that online gaming 
                began under the genre of AD&D (Advanced Dungeon & Dragons). AD&D 
                had set "alignments" that your character followed when created. 
                You could be Good, Neutral, or Evil (with a few sub Alignments 
                in between: Lawful and Chaotic). My character, being the Chaotic 
                Evil God of KAAOS that he is, kills at random just for the joy 
                of killing and collection of souls for the spritzers. >;) In today's 
                games, your opponents have no way of knowing your "Alignment" 
                so they just have to judge you by your actions. If my gnomish 
                Warrior was to walk up to someone, and just whack the crap out 
                of them, Am I a PK'er. YES! Why? Because I attacked you. I am 
                an EVIL person. I will just soon kill you as to look at you. This 
                action does not make me a PK'er. If real-time combat allowed for 
                Role-play (which it doesn't) I would role-play it.. but with the 
                system games have now, there is no possible way to role-play this 
                before the situation occurs. This must transpire AFTER the damage 
                is done. By then it is too late. I am labeled a PK'er. </P>
              <P align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;This is what people do not understand 
                in games today. Just because I kill you, does not make me a PK'er.. 
                it could be that I am actually role-playing my character the same 
                way I have always been. This brings me to another point.. </P>
              <P align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;With the introduction of Real-Time combat.. 
                the need for a centralized, Server based, Messaging center is 
                more than ever. I could post my role-play stories, my character 
                bios, tales of my other slayings on this board for all to see. 
                People would begin to recognize names and guilds and Role-playing 
                PvPers would have a chance to live again. There are message board 
                upon message boards flung all over the 'net. Hell.. there are 
                more SB message boards than I have ex-girlfriends (and that is 
                A LOT). If a gaming company was to make an area, on their game 
                site, that allowed for Private Guild areas, General Tales, and 
                Guild forums, the sense of community in that game would grow by 
                leaps and bounds. Players would have one place to go to find what 
                town KAAOS overran that day, Who lost the DeathMatch that was 
                fought outside the TheMercs outhouse. People would have one place 
                in which to LIVE the game they play. It would allow those less 
                fortunate, who do not have 23 hours a day to play, to keep up 
                with what was going on in the game. One kicker though... Players 
                would need FREE REIGN over these boards. Flaming, Challenges, 
                Stories. EQ's Whineplay board is a prime example of what NOT to 
                do. "Flame and you will be banned?" What the hell is that. Flaming 
                is part of the game. It is part of human nature. Competitiveness 
                is the KEY to playing a MMORPG. Without this, you might as well 
                unplug the DSL and play it solo. Granted.. we don't need four 
                letter words flying all over the place, any intelligent person 
                can flame without resorting to profanity, but flames make the 
                game more fun, for those flaming and those reading and getting 
                a chuckle out of 'em. To accomplish this would be so easy, I don't 
                understand why NO ONE has even attempted it. You would need 1 
                staff member to moderate the boards. Hell.. I would VOLUNTEER 
                to do it if a gaming company would put out the effort. I did this 
                for 5+ years in Neverwinter Nights as a staff member. I moderated 
                the entire Message board area. The Public Forums, The Guild Forums, 
                and the Private Sanctioned Guild Forums. It was really not that 
                difficult. Delete a post here and there, issue a warning here 
                and there, but for the most part things went pretty smooth. </P>
              <P align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;In closing.. I would like to say that 
                there is still apart of me that thinks that maybe someday, my 
                (and most others) idea of a Utopian RPG will come to be. My only 
                fear is that *I* will have to fund the damn thing, and until I 
                can figure out a way to "Pee-Kay" my grandmother, that isn't going 
                to happen :)</P>
