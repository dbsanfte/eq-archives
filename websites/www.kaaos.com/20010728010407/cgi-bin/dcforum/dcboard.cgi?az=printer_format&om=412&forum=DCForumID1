But don't let that stop you from hitting any of the PvP servers. There are KAAOS reps on most of them (cept VZ). Maybe you can hook up with Quen Dalk and make it two-some, I hear that thing is making a come back to &lt;laff&gt;<P><BR>SangDraxx<BR>KAAOS<BR>The Serpent Lord<P><BR>

My my, there’s a name from the past. Been a long time since I had a chance to bitch slap you in PvP Tyst. At least yer e-crutch made you a bit more challenging than the LH hut newbs. <P>Come to the new PvP server when it opens. You’ll be starting on equal footing with everyone. The PvP sucks in EQ but at least the ass beatings you’ll be receiving by KAAOS will give you that feeling of nostalgia. <P>Azmodion<BR>KAAOS

The fact ye can kill any level you wish must sound pretty exciting to ye'll.  I think these new PVP rules are right up Kaaos's alley. Been a while since I heard someone cry bout being kilt online.  <P>Got a quick question that I expect ye'll to lie about the answer.  Does it make adifferene which class ye play fer PVP..  I expect to use a Wizard but is PVP that bad in this game that they all suck?<P>BTW&gt; You all Suck!!  Prepare to Die.

<BR>The class you play must be as much about how you want to fit into grouping as it is about how you want to PVP.  In the meantime, here's a brief but inadequate rundown of a few classes until I get bored of typing.  Also, the game changes for all the classes as you go up the levels.  In X range, one calss will have the edge, and 3 levels later it'll change.<P>Necro - best for soloing, you can get xp without a group - solid in PVP and probably PVP king until people get common access to pumice and fat cancel magic spells to shed your dots.  Best pet in the game.  Great OUTDOOR fighter with shadowstep line, not too great in dungeons.  Generalist in groups, not a deeply NEEDED class.  Best grouping ability - give away your manna, and use darkness spells to slow mobs to keep them from running away.<P>Wizard - king of gank.  Best class to catch a wounded player and ace them before they can react.  Other than that, a wizard can often be a punching bag in PVP.  They are great escape artists in outdoor zones with Yonder line so they can be hard to kill if you don't care about sticking around in a losing fight.  Best grouping abilities - evacuate and teleport spells - the taxi cabs of EQ.<P>Druids - the best "everything" class.  Most versatile and very self-sufficient.  Good escape artists in PVP once they get spirit of the cheetah, nice DOTs, nice DD, healing ability, decent equipment options, etc.  Not the master of much of anything but ultimately flexible.  Desired in groups for group teleports, SOW, and since most of them are halfling - blow jobs.<P>Warriors - dead meat in PVP until 50ish with good resist gear and killer damage.  Far better off fighting in an indoor zone where it's hard for a caster to keep his distance.  VERY needed in groups to keep mobs off casters and allow them time to cast.<P>Ok, I'm bored.
