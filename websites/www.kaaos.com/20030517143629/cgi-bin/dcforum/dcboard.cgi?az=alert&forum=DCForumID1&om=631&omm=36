Not really if you only count you and Ritual from the evidence this topic makes. No one else made a comment.[/i]

No, what I wrote was:

[i]"There are a lot of people in this guild with an opinion on what makes for a good PvP game. I didn’t respond because I do not believe you are capable of understanding anything outside your own little opinions. You are blind. In addition to being blind you appear to be deaf, dumb and stupid. I’m sure many others haven’t responded for the same reason, they may as well just talk to a wall."[/i]

My appologies, I forgot you were a retard for a moment. I will translate in simple speech so that you can understand.

"Just about everyone here has an opinion but they didn't respond to you because you are stupid and will not understand anything they have to say."

A little clearer for you now?

[i]"Kind of sad to have two people try to gank me for saying that an item can be used for counter-tactics. One tries to say you can only use those items for strategy instead of a counter-tactic. The other tries to write stuff for the benefit of self and not to share info. Then tries to act or put words into the person who wants to prove a point that there are a lot of “counter-tactics in Ultima. The one making fun of the geo will not prove otherwise because I am right. Since I am right he will not show it on his KAAOS guild forum………. How sad and deprived it is being evil, ROFL!"[/i]

I have not elaborated because you are a lost cause man. You don't understand, well, anything. Everytime I get the urge to elaborate you prove to me (by posting 5 more incoherent replies to the same message before I even get around to replying) that it would be a lost cause. I did write a reply which talked about all those points you tried to make but after I saw this [link:www.kaaos.com/cgi-bin/dcforum/dcboard.cgi?az=show_thread&omm=21&om=631&forum=DCForumID1|post] in reply to Mortarion I knew it was just a waste of time. 
 
Oh, and BTW:

[i]"Counter tactics are counter attacks. Running would also be a counter attack or tactic."[/i]

No, idiot. counter-tactics are not counter-attacks. That is to say they are not one in the same. As far as running away, running away can not be considered a counter-attack or a counter-tactic. It could conceivably be considered a tactic however. Of course, you would be grapsing at straws at that point.
