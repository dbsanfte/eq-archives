				<td colspan="2"><span class="postbody">The men crouched and huddled low together in the flickering, failing lighting of the basement, sweat pouring from their bodies due to the inadequate cooling.  Bombs and munitions shook the entrenchment regularly, the explosions the only other sound present aside from each soldier's labored breathing through the dust filled air.  Hedron gave a furtive glance towards the door before running a bare hand over his mostly bald head, trying to wipe away the moisture that had beaded atop it.
<br />

<br />
No one spoke.  Hardly anyone moved.  Stalk sat hunched over on a hard patch of exposed dirt floor, one decimator on his back, another in his hand.  His eyes, now empty and brooding, stared a hole straight into the ground, Stalk rocking ever so slightly back and forth.  Ericcorp was one of the only men who stood.  He hovered over a shoddy iron table with a myraid of CUD peices and crude makeshift tools strewn across it.  The sweat didn't even seem to bother him as he tried to assemble two incredibly tiny peices of electronics equipment, only to have them break in his hands.  In a rare display of emotion, he slammed the broken CUD into the floor, overturning the table abrubtly in a cacophony of noise.
<br />

<br />
"...it's broke," he muttered in a cynical monotone, having already returned to his stoicisim as he took a seat, propping up against the wall.
<br />

<br />
After what seemed like what could have been an eternity or only a few minutes, Hedron stood, encircled by the men.  He slowly surveyed the makeshift bunker - one of the last Terran entrenchments in the Auraxis system.  It had been almost two weeks now since the Vanu and New Conglomerate had brought to bear massive numbers of BFRs, also known as "Battle Frame Robots", against the Republic.  The Terrans responded in kind, yet somehow the Vanu and Conglomerate were simply able to field much greater numbers than the TR.  At first, it seemed only as if the Terrans would loose their buffer planets, yet as the VS attrition grew, Forseral was put under the heaviest seige it had ever seen.  What seemed like limitless numbers of the ruthless robots streamed through the gates and the TR's own hacked BFR terminals.  There was simply no end in sight.  First it was Eadon, then Bel, Ogma and Caer.  Finally the Terran stronghold of Anu fell, cutting off the supply line from the Sanctuary.  It was then that all hell broke loose.
<br />

<br />
While many Terrans wondered what the NC were doing, the Vanu seemed to be content with letting their other continents fall to the Conglomerate in order to assure the annihilation of the Republic.  Even with Terran BFRs going toe to toe with Soverignty BFRs on the front lines, it seemed like the Republic was loosing ground all the way.  Neit finally fell under seige once the subcapitals fell.  It was an utter massacre.  KAAOS, despite running non stop anti-BFR operations for over three days straight, could not halt the Vanu march on Neit.  With over fifty to sixty of the giant machines at Neit alone, the base was completely leveled.  The NTU's could simply not repair fast enough.  The Vanu left Neit without taking the main computer, not even bothering to attempt to replinish or rebuild it, simply content to leave it to fade into a neutral facility, smashed to utter ruin.
<br />

<br />
KAAOS did not rest.
<br />

<br />
KAAOS only continued to fight relentlessly.  Men did not sleep.  Men did not eat - they only continued tirelessly to defend the shrinking Terran frontlines.  Time became utterly irrelevant.  Rest was the period between death and respawn.  But it was then that the Vanu, with the help of the New Conglomerate, were able to hack into the Terran Sanctuary warpgate.
<br />

<br />
Blood, for the first time, lay strewn across the green fields of the Terran Sanctuary without recourse.  The Hart buildings were smoking husks, entombing the few survivors of the Sanctuary attack and dooming them to a slow death by starvation beneath the rubble.  The lattice links were overtaken and hacked by the Vanu, even as the Conglomerate marched on their home planet of Amerish.  It was thought by the surviving Terrans who still remained on Forseral that the Vanu would withdraw finally to protect their homeland.  
<br />

<br />
Yet, the Vanu march continued on.  And now they were here.  KAAOS, the last few remnants of the Republic were still fighting, still holding out against whatever might come at them.  Without resources, without a place to go, they fought on.  For the first time in the history of the war - death was final.  Death was real.  There was no place left to respawn.  There was no place left for those surviving Terrans to run.  The Vanu were performing an extermination campaign - combing through each gridsquare and eradicating every last vestige of the TR.  Yet still, KAAOS remained.
<br />

<br />
Hedron wiped the sweat from his eyes with one hand, clearing his throat slightly.
<br />

<br />
"They're here," he said.
<br />

<br />
Eric barely pulled back a small camoflauged tarp, exposing the sliver of a hole that led outside as a window.
<br />

<br />
"They've stopped artillery. One to the North. Dual lasers," he muttered, replacing the tarp.
<br />

<br />
Feyd stood, tightening the strap on the deimator attached to his back.
<br />

<br />
"I'll go," he said.
<br />

<br />
Eric's flat expression didn't change at all, nor did many of the other soldier's.  Everyone knew what needed to be done.  Someone always had to die so that the others could live.  It had worked before, and it would work again.  It was the way.
<br />

<br />
Silently the men stood together inside the dirt filled bunker.  Hedron approached Feyd.
<br />

<br />
"We're not going to miss or mourn you.  Just remember-"
<br />

<br />
Feyd interrupted Hedron for the first time in his life.
<br />

<br />
"This is transient.  KAAOS is eternal," Feyd said, completing the mantra that had been burned into his mind ever since the first day of his outfit training.  Hedron smirked as Feyd turned towards the door, pausing briefly to look back on all the faces that he had gotten to know and people he had come to admire over the course of his time with KAAOS.  
<br />

<br />
"Get moving," Eric said.
<br />

<br />
Feyd cracked a grin just as he cast aside the heavy door leading to the outside, adrenaline and implant muscle-surge enhancement coursing through his veins.  He ran wildly across the grassy plain towards the BFR, the decimator over his shoulder bobbing with his gait.  The massive robot froze momentarily, then slowly began to turn to face him.  Feyd pulled forth a jammer grenade and yanked the pin with his teeth, still running like a madman straight at the Battle Frame that towered over him.
<br />

<br />
Heaving the grenade at the BFR with a massive yell, Feyd watched as it impacted the BFR's shields, sending it's deadly EMP shockwave through the robot.  Passing through the phase shield, Feyd shouldered his Decimator, and fired straight at the BFR's knee joint.  The warhead impacted, staggering the machine.  Feyd heard a cheer echo behind him from the vicinity of the bunker, slamming the next rocket into the chamber.  Still yelling, Feyd sent the next rocket into the BFR's chest, the robot now backpeadaling wildly as it's Lasers now flicked up peices of the ground here and there, the disabled computer unable to get a bead on Feyd.  Another cheer rose from the bunker.  The BFR toppled over onto it's back as the movement servos ran amok, shifting the BFR's odd center of balance off.  Feyd scrambled upon the BFR's chest dragging the decimator with him.
<br />

<br />
"<span style="font-style: italic"><span style="font-weight: bold">RRRAAAAAGGGGHHHHHHH!!!!!!!</span></span>"
<br />

<br />
Feyd's scream echoed across the plain as he straddled the cockpit, pulling his finger down on the trigger that would surely end the BFR.
<br />

<br />
Yet nothing happened.
<br />

<br />
The rocket still lay in it's chamber.  The BFR's sensors were slowly coming back online as it's mono eye flickered back to life.  The rocket had been a misfire.  Feyd listened in horror as the movement servos came back online with a disgusting wine.  Beneath the thick layers of protective shielding, he could hear the pilot laughing at him.
<br />

<br />
"No."
<br />

<br />
Feyd yanked the rocket from the decimator.
<br />

<br />
"NO."
<br />

<br />
He grasped it tightly, holding the munition high over his head.
<br />

<br />
"<span style="font-style: italic"><span style="font-weight: bold">NO!!</span></span>"
<br />

<br />
In one swift motion, Feyd went to his knees, slamming the Decimator rocket into the cockpit with both hands.  A blinding explosion issued forth, the men in the bunker immediately hitting the deck as debris poured in through the tarp and into the small makeshift windows.  Slowly, they peered from the window as the dust settled, looking out over the wreckage.  They opened the door and walked cautiously towards the downed BFR, now an ash-covered mess of electronics and sputtering power conduits.  Where Feyd's body had been on the front of the cockpit was now a small outline where the paint had not been melted off of the BFR - there was simply nothing left of the body.  A light breeze picked up, pushing along the smoke from the wreckage gently over the plains.  Silence came over the men as they watched for several moments...it was as if one of them had finally found peace.
<br />

<br />
Stalk whirled around almost instinctively, shoulding up his weapon, the other soldiers soon following suit.  Before the men loomed two BFRs, their weapons charging.  Several moments of silence passed as the two forces stood face to face...
<br />

<br />
With a deafening roar, KAAOS charged.
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">___________________________________________________</span>
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
"Holy shit...where am-"
<br />

<br />
First there was a blinding light, then utter darkness.  Tricking water babbled somewhere off in the distance.  The smell of earth and stone hung in the air with a tinge of rust and metal.  Feyd struggled to consciousness.
<br />

<br />
His vision blurred into a myriad of red, black and grey mixed with glowing oranges and deep shining crimsons.  Trying to move his arms, they felt incredibly heavy, as did the rest of his body.  Looking down at himself, Feyd knew enough to realize he no longer had on his Republic armor, but a robe or simple frock of somekind, and it was <span style="font-style: italic">incredibly</span> itchy and uncomfortable.  After several more moments of trying to remember what had happened, his vision slanted into focus.  The movement of his arms was accompanied by dragging metal.  Feyd looked down at his hands, still calloused and covered in ash from battle, but nonetheless healthy despite what he had been through, yet his limbs lay in chains.
<br />

<br />
"This...this must be..."  Feyd started.
<br />

<br />
"<span style="font-style: italic">Hell?</span>"
<br />

<br />
A voice called from somewhere.  Somewhere close.  Feyd struggled to his feet despite his manacles.  He was inside a cell.  The rough brick walls stood made of the same material of the floor, the only illumination being that of an itermittent torch every few cells down what Feyd could see to be a lengthy hallway which led into a main chamber of sorts.  From the chamber, Feyd could hear the sounds of people talking and conversing, some in strange gutteral languages he had never heard, mixed with the sounds of food being prepared.  An ear peircing female scream echoed from the same room followed by a booming cacophony of laughter as the scream was abrubptly silenced.  Feyd looked through the bars across to the cell from his own.  In it was someone who appeared to be dressed in the same garb as him, yet the man was hunched over in the fetal position in the middle of the cell clutching his stomach, seemingly in a large pool of his own blood.
<br />

<br />
"I...I died.  This has to be hell, right?"  Feyd spoke to himself, trying to grasp it, to make sense of it all.  He leaned his head up against the bars, staring out into the flickering torchlight, his mind wandering...
<br />

<br />
"<span style="font-style: italic">This isn't hell.</span>"
<br />

<br />
The same voice boomed around him, Feyd lurching backwards from the bars, stumbling and hitting his head on the iron slab of a bed that hung down from the wall on chains.  Clutching the back of his head, Feyd watched as the outline of a figure stood looming over him on the other side of the bars.
