                throughout the lands of Neverwinter, the cries of those in pain 
                could be heard. Even the tortured souls of children moaned and 
                screeched. But amidst the cries of pain and anguish, the sounds 
                of anger rose much higher.</font></p>
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> 
                The people of NeverWinter, despite being harassed by the Nazi 
                rule under the Hitler-like leader, NW Snowie, were fighting back. 
                What did they have to lose? Their homes had already been compromised. 
                Even before the loss of their homes, the secret raids of the uncaring 
                gestapo NW agents took place.. No, NW had not gotten better with 
                time...it had gotten worse.</font></p>
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> 
                Luckily these people who were willing to fight until the end, 
                these very people whom were like a family to each other.. they 
                became better and they grew stronger. Whether it be in NeverWinter 
                or elsewhere.. these people would thrive. Well, as long as KAAOS 
                allowed them to, at least. </font></p>

                Amidst the Gestapo... even in these realms controlled by NW Hitler,

                but the power is always there.</font></p>

                stupid ass, fucking Nors and other assorted goodies, yelling their

                the wusses and pussies of the realms, you will be remembered... 
                the rest of you will be forgotten or laughed it. Thus is the way

                may wish to look at and remember.. or block out and repress. </font></p>

                We have the scene of NW Lethe and NW Kishpa, two gestapo agents. 
                Both are anal and bleed from their asses, daily. </font></p>
              <p align="left"><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Imagine, 
                if you will, NW Lethe strapping on her 14 inch strap-on cock and 
                pounding the hell out of NW Kishpa. Imagine Kishpa squeeling like 
                a pig as his stretched asshole was violated by Lethe's massive 
                tool, yelling "Red Vette, save me!" And then having her bitch 
                slap him in response. A cute picture, eh? Perhaps it was Kishpa's 
                pussy it was pounding in and out of, who knows with him? </font></p>
              <p align="left"><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I'd 
                like to bid a farewell to those two plus all of the assorted sluts 
                and other fucking anal losers who played this game and lived in 
                our realms. Good riddance. </font></p>

                this is where the unity was. Not only did KAAOS boast the best
