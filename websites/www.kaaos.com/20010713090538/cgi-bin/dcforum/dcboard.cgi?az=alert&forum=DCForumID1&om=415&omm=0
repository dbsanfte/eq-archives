Well shit, I thought that by now you would have all sodomized each other to death!  But here you still are, working steadily toward that goal as always.  I wish I could come over to the new PVP server on EQ and renew the rivalries of the old days, but realtime PVP just doesn't have the appeal for me.  I'm on the Cazic-Thule server with the two guys I started SOL with (Abyss and Sun), as well as a few other old SOL's.  Soldiers of Light is still around, but I haven't had anything to do with them since I left NWN.  To be honest, my best memories of NWN involve KAAOS, either fighting for or against.  I don't think too many of ya knew I had a KAAOSer other than Mal and Rellik.  His name was Prospal and his only real purpose was to put yet another KAAOS God in the top ten on the PVP Ladder, although Lumen was always above him <G>  Anyway, I heard my guild eventually turned to shit after Abyss and I left.  I don't know if it's true or not, but it was repectable while we were in charge.  Too bad poor leadership took over, from what I've heard.  Anyway, with all the new MMORPG's coming out, maybe one of them will have a decent PVP environment.  Hell, maybe I'll even roll up a Troll Warrior and come over the the new PVP server to hang out with some old friends, but I still don't get much out of PVP in EQ.  By the way, didn't some of you move to Nashville right around the demise of NWN?  Wasn't it Doomers and Hedron?  I know Drk Anjel used to live here.  Not sure if she still does.  I moved up here about a year ago, so I'd like to hear if there's any of ya close.  I've got a wife and kid now, so it would be good to know what parts of town to keep em away from! <G>

P.S. - Let me respond to some of your replies ahead of time...

No, you suckit!
No, I will not bbbbllllllooooowwwwwwww you!
No, YOU worship it.
YeahsureshateverImawussjustshutthefuckup.
Yes, I know you wish you could have found my mother while she was pregnant just so you could rip a hole in her abdomen and fuck me up the ass while I was still a fetus.  Real sorry we both missed out on that one <G>

And for those of you too green to know who the hell I am, I earned the respect of KAAOS a long time ago as a goodie, and then I earned it as a fellow GOD, so take any wise-ass newb comments you can muster up, shove them directly up your overstretched asshole, and go fuck yourself.  

Finally, I would like to end with: WHHHHHHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!
