----------------------------------------------------
Shiva wiped his blade off on his robe as he stood, looming of the corpse.  What was left of the man lay slumped in the corner of the room.  A sheet of crimson now draped the floor where he lay.  His once polished breastplate had been hewed in half, where a blade had entered his left side, and exited on the other.  His head, and the remnants of his left arm had come to rest near the foot of a chair.  Shiva slid his sword back into its sheath, and upon exiting the room, gave the bodiless head a swift kick, sending it skitting across the floor, leaving a trail of spattered blood and bits of flesh as it rolled.

Shiva’s dark figure slipped through the massive oaken door, and out on to the ramparts.  The duke had built his city well.  A huge stone wall encompassed the town on which he now looked.  Gargoyles adorned the gate, keeping their silent watch with blackened stone eyes.

The dark figure stood, engulfed in the shadow cash by the noble house.  The guards that happened to walk in this particular direction did not live more than a moment, as two dark hands grasped their skulls and twisted, as to render them lifeless to be tossed into the murky depths of the moat.  His vigilant wait had come to an end, the light in peak of the noble house sputtered, and was extinguished.

His black cloak billowed above him as he leapt from the wall on to the closest roof, striding across the bundled straw that kept out the rain.  

The doors of the noble house were guarded heavily, for the period of about twelve minutes.  Under the guise of darkness, the figure came; all they saw was a sliver of silver descend from nowhere, and cut them to ribbons.  Each stroke sent another victim to the ground, clutching their jugular or chest as the length of steel entered silently, and withdrew itself almost before its presence was known.

There the figure stood, amidst a circle of slain guards.  A stain of crimson had been left from one of the incisions, and graced the side of his face.  He ran his tongue across the familiar liquid.  He knew its taste well… and its lust.  The veins in his arms began to pulse.  The taste of the blood of another revived memories of battles fought where he had been drenched in it.  The crimson flowed down his brow, across his cheek, and to his lips.  His clothes, saturated with the liquid, clung to his form.  The lust began to engulf the warrior.

His free hand grabbed the nearest corpse, and with the other, used his blade to split open his chest.  Dropping his blade, he plunged his hands in.  The blood-curdling crack of bone could be heard for miles as her tore the ribs away from the victim’s heart.  All the while blood streamed down his arms and cascaded across the folds of his robe.

A switch jerk removed the heart.  It was inherently warm, and he pressed it to his brow.  A sadistic smile crept across Shiva’s lips as the blood ran down his face.  His once pale flesh was dyed a blazing crimson.

He arose and retrieved his sword.  With a blade in one hand, and the deflated flesh of the heart in the other he stormed into the noble house and ascended the stairs.  The bloodlust consumed his will as he began to take the steps in threes, eager to arrive at his next victim.  

The top stair marked causeway to the royal bedroom.  He threw open the door, but the nobles were not to be found.  The walls were painted with blood, and bits of flesh that had been torn off riddled the room.  

A figure stood in front of the bed.  It was more demon than man.  It’s body was adorned by red scales, including its massive tail that had anchored itself around what was perhaps the remains of a human that had been sufficiently gnawed upon.  It was massive, occupying the area from floor to ceiling.  Great horns grew from the sides of its head, much like a massive bull.  Its powerful arms held in their grasp what looked like a leg, frequently raising it to its mouth so that the creature could tear the flesh off with its dagger-like teeth.  The spectacle was horrible to behold, as the demon feasted upon its fallen adversaries.

The God let out a blood-curdling laugh as Shiva looked on.

“You have Kaaos in you meat sack.  I see it in your eyes.  But, whether or not you stand beside me in battle, or I feast upon you like this waste of flesh, is entirely your doing,” uttered the demon as it flung the bone, now picked clean in Shiva’s direction.

And with that, the God rose to its full height, sending furniture flying across the room as it whipped its powerful tail.  Its powerful hind legs vaulted the creature through the gaping hole in the roof from which it entered.

The lord of blades stood in the center of the room, perplexed by the demon.  A vicious smile crept across his face as he faded into the shadows, and likewise disappeared into the night.
