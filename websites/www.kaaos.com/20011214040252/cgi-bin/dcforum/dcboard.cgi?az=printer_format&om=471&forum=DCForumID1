&gt;Oh, when I enjoy a good <BR>&gt;screenshot at the warcry network, <BR>&gt;that shadowbane provided, why am <BR>&gt;I going to donate warcry? <P>Why you're asking the question here, I don't know. But that you're asking it anywhere tells me that I wouldn't want to take your donation anyway, you ignorant skinflint fuckhead.

Such a hypocrite J- go write a 'FUCKING' editorial. I know you, you know me- not by this sig. Its not everyday you meet some halfass ex journalist who never really played games until he was pulled into the game site biz writing for Dr T ripping the hell out of shadowbane until finally he thought it looked interesting, only to change your mind more often than these damn kaaosrs :! WHEEEEe?!  I dare you to reply, just dont do it *be a good boy and listen to mummy- ignore the dude.<P>I weas just shooting shit from my sewer as I occasionally do, and unlike these seasoned kaaosers- j0u just dont know when to stfu. kthnx.<P>Kapn Kangaroo luvs you, if you just accept him as your leader, seeing as he died for your sins and all.

Ok 'kid'  -<P>Thanks for the column, and taking my advice - but it was not I who finally got you off your ass, was it, k!d.. <P>I cant access it atm, it must be those asheron call posters huh? yea..  I bet its a great piece of very terse shit tho.<P>**<BR>__<BR>You really need to stick with 'writing based on material', you just cant seem to handle the pressure - to make a sensible response¿<P><BR>*I find it funny when a writers material can appear to make so much sense when they really dont have much sense at all- outside their material.<P>J_  ,cOok0o ~ undo your vest.<P>_J_
