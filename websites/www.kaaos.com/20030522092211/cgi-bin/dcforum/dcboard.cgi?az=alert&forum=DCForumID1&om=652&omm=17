Technically science fiction is fantasy, which I already stated. And Star Wars had a good mix of sci-fi related fantasy and mystical fantasy, however I still would not classify it as high fantasy. The setting means a lot for fantasy fans. I enjoy sci-fi related books, movies and games (such as FPS and RTS) but I personally am not interested in an RPG based in a sci-fi setting. 

You know, and kind of unrelated to this topic, now that I’m thinking on the subject of sci-fi, I do remember a couple books that were a cool mix of sci-fi and more classic fantasy which I dug quite a bit when I was a kid. I haven’t read them in probably around 20 – 25 years so they may not be as good as I remember. Fantasy has come a long way since then so they probably aren’t up to par with today’s literary works. They were short books if I remember correctly though so might be worth a read if you can find a copy (I’m sure they are well out of print by now). Anyway, the books were called “Hunters of the Red Moon” and the sequel “The Survivor’s”. 

Ahahaha, that and “Death World Trilogy” was good stuff back then. Damn that was a long time ago. 

If you do happen to find them though, I wouldn’t expect any brilliant writing, I was easily amused when I was 10 ;p
