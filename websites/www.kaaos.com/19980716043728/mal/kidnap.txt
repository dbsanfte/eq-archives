Subj:  The SOUL IS MINE!!!
Date:  96-06-15 05:06:52 EDT
From:  Mad Drunk       

    	The pact was made, between the Drunken God of KAAOS, and the Zwei's of
the Shadow Alliance.  In exchange for their souls stolen from the field of
battle, their firstborn child was promised to the Drunk.  A short few weeks
after the pact was made, Sagan Zwei took his first breath of air, and then
the pact was broken.
     	A furious Mad Drunk, paced back and forth across the hard stone floor of
the Hellhole.  Several days had passed since the birth of the child, and it
was apparent that the Zweis and the Shadow Alliance refused to honor their
agreement.  Arielzwei even went as far as to threaten the KAAOS GOD if he
attempted to take the child on his own. With a wave of his hand, MD opened
the gateway between the Hellhole and the realms.  The Drunk was not pleased.
     	Creatures, large and small alike, quickly scrambled out of the rampaging
god's path.  Mad Drunk flew swiftly by them, not even acknowledging their
existence, determined to fulfill the pact on this most unholy night.  He
slowed only once, smashing his flail upside the head of an unfortunate
paladin that crossed his path, and savoring the soul.  An hour later, the
Drunk reached his destination,  the Shadow Alliance Compound.  He would have
the child this night.
     	MD quickly scans the front entrance for guards.  A single guard stands
watch at the front gate, and two others watch above from towers.  The direct
approach would be difficult, and the whole compound would be alerted.  Under
normal circumstances the Drunken God would walk right up, challenging
everyone to battle.  But this night was different, he had to carry his child
out.  There had to be another way in.
     	Looking to his left, past the heavy iron gate and along the ivy ridden
wall of the SA compound, he found his way.  A window on the second level was
open.  Pulling his cloak of Elvenkind over his black garbed frame, Mad makes
his way towards the window, towards the child.  
     	Pulling himself quickly through the window, the Drunk emerges in a
darkened room full of equipment and clothing.  Carefully climbing over the
debris and clothing littering the floor, the Mad God makes his way towards
the door. The first part of his plan was complete.  He was past the outer
defenses.  Now all that remained was the matter of locating the child.  
     	Suddenly the door begins to open, sending a loud creaking noise through
the room.  Halfway between the door and the nearest cover, the Drunk had no
where to conceal himself.  MD crouches down to a knee, throwing his cloak
over his head, and concealing himself in the shadows.  Light floods the room.
The Drunk appears invisible, but his shadow is not.
     	"Who goes there?!?!", a voice demands.
     	Seemingly caught, the Drunken God falls back on his alternative plan.
Pulling a black mask over his face he stands to greet the SA guard.  He
stands, silently, and faces the guard.  Dressed completely in black, and
wearing a black mask, in all appearances he is a BSA.
     	"Follow me, assassin", the voice instructs him.
     	The Drunk chuckles as he thinks to himself.  "Assassin, how true, how
true."
     	Mumbling something bout the stupid BSA types, the guard leads Mad Drunk
down the hallway, heading towards the barracks.  The Drunken God of KAAOS
follows silently behind his generous, yet foolish, tour guide, all the time
searching for his prey.  Then, after only a few short moments, Mad spots the
person who will lead him to the child.  Arielzwei, the child's mother.

From:  AriZwei         

	Mumbling to herself, her footsteps clicking faintly on the marbled floors,
Ariel hurries through the SA Compound.  Realizing that she is late for
Sagen's feeding, she curses her busy schedule and the time that it is taking
away from her precious son.
	Suddenly remembering that she has yet to look in on her newest Shades, she
makes a quick detour past the training grounds.  Standing at the edge of the
field, she sees Redd putting the Shades through their paces in PVP training.
Chuckling softly to herself as she sees the recruits finally notice her
presence and coming quickly to attention.  She walks over to Redd and
embraces him in a bear hug.  "Thank you brother, for all of your help now
when I need it so".  After visiting a few moments and answering the questions
of her charges, Ariel makes her way to the Guildhouse.
	Smiling at the guards chosen to watch the entrance, she assures them that she
will provide them with refreshment momentarily, and thanks them for their
loyal service in this, her time of need.
	Noticing the quiet of the Guildhouse, she smiles softly, thinking that she
and Sagen can have some quiet time together, before laying down for a much
needed rest.
	Hurrying up the wide stairs leading to the Bedchambers, Ariel can hear a
commotion down the hall.  Rolling her eyes in frustration, she makes her way
towards the noises to investigate.  Seeing one of the guards escorting a BSA
in her direction, a look of puzzlement comes over her face.  How very
unusual..  BSA are not normally in the Guildhouse..  But this one is
unfamiliar to her, so she realizes that he must be lost. Noticing the awkward
way he carries himself (not much finesse there) she makes a mental note to
tell Melkor that this particular BSA could definitely use some extra lessons
in movement.
	Smiling briefly, she quickly passes the two brothers, and calling out a quick
greeting, she rushes to the end of the corridor and the entrance to the GM's
bedchamber.
	Rushing inside, a smile of anticipation on her face, she sees the guard
chosen to baby-sit sitting by the bassinet next to the bed.  Hurrying over,
she peers inside a look of delight on her face, her eyes shining. Lifting the
small bundle into her arms, she looks up at the guard and whispers softly
"you may leave us now".
	"But Milady!", the guard stammers, "I am not to leave the young one's side!"
"Please go now.  I am going to be feeding the little one, and most certainly
to not require your presence for that!"  Softening her tone, she adds, "I
will make things right with the Chancellor, young one.  Do not fear."
	Smiling at her gratefully, the guard quickly leaves her with the babe.
Settling back on the bed, she begins nursing.  Singing softly, her eyes begin
to flutter closed as fatigue finally overcomes her.

From:  Mad Drunk       

	"The barracks are just around the corner", the guard starts to tell the
BSA, then stops when he realizes he is alone. 
	The Drunken God of KAAOS follows Arielzwei as she walks towards her
bedchambers, his cloak concealing him in the shadows.  He pauses behind a
stone pillar as Ariel enters her bedchambers.  Moving silently to the door,
Mad listens intently for movement and sound from inside.  The sound of
footsteps send the Drunk back into the shadows.
     	The approaching footsteps of the clumsy guard ring against the stone
floor.  The guard opens the door to the Zwei's bedchamber, steps into the
hall, then closes the door behind him.  He pauses at the door to lock it,
then leaves down the west corridor.  Unfortunately for Ariel and her child,
he failed to notice the Drunk crouching beside the doorway.
     	Mad Drunk steps out of the shadows as the guard leaves the hallway.  The
Drunk knows the child is almost his.  Picking the feeble lock of the door, MD
moves cautiously into the bedchamber.  His god-like vision quickly adapts to
the darkness of the room, as he scans for his prey.       
     	Arielzwei is startled awake by the sound of her child's loud cries.
Jumping to her feet, she runs to check on her child, Sagan.  As she enters
the child's room, Ariel can sense the pure evil in the air, and immediately
regrets dismissing her room guard.  Concern for her child's safety is
interrupted as a powerful hand grabs her by the throat.
     	Carrying the child in one arm, and dragging Arielzwei along by the
throat, Mad steps through the dimension door gateway he created to the
Hellhole.  The magical gateway winks out of existence as he steps into the
hellhole, mother and child in tow.  His fellow KAAOS GODS surround the Drunk,
helping him with his prisoners.  Arielzwei is lead away, and Mad Drunk is
left holding the child.
     	"So Sagen, what shall we do today?", Mad says as he begins to laugh.
And his evil laughter is heard throughout the realms.

From:  AriZwei         

	Ariel awakes with a start, a small cry escaping her lips as she remembers
what has happened and where she is.  Slowly raising her hand to her bruised
throat, she brushes her fingers over it, wincing.  She tries once again to
mindspeak either Melkor or one of her brothers, but to no avail.  Somehow
these cretins have found a way to block this, the most powerful of all her
mage gifts.  A tear rolls slowly down her cheek, and she brushes it away
quickly.  She must not cry here.  No matter what, she must never cry in
this place they call the hellhole.  Strengthening her resolve, she begins
to go over what she already knows.
	They have not been back since they left her here last night.  They did
not leave her bound, but somehow they have blocked not only her mindspeech,
but all of her spells.  She knows that they underestimate her, that they
think her weak.  This is good and can work in her favor, if she can only
figure out a way to take advantage of it.
	Her face takes on a fierce look as she remembers the sight of Mad Drunk
holding Sagen in his arms, as his repugnant brethren dragged her away.
For herself she feels no fear.  She has been through much in her young
life and knows that she can be strong.  But her son...  The mere thought
of the Drunk even touching a hair on his head, is enough to make her
insane with worry.  Pacing back and forth across the small room, her
hands balled into fists, she begins to curse the cretin who has brought
this about.
	Rushing to the door, pounding until her fists ache and the blood
begins dripping from her knuckles, she screams for him.

MAD DRUNK!  COME AND FACE ME, YOU COWARD!

Subj:  Discovery
Date:  96-06-16 14:55:16 EDT
From:  ThundrChld      

     	Pandemonium is rampant in the House of Shadows. Armored troops search
the grounds for any sign of the missing mother and child. From the window of
the keep, ThundrChld watches knowing it will all be for naught. He turns his
attention back to the night guard who is cowering on the floor before him.
"You say that you saw no one during your watch." The soft spoken words do
nothing to allay the fears of the conscript. ThundrChld lowers his head, and
brings his hands before his chest palm to palm. The air in the room seems to
thicken while the temperature drops. The guard stops trembling. His eyes roll
back in his head. A faint shimmering fills the air between the two. 
     	The scene forms. Two figures walk the dark halls. The guard and another
form all in black. The guards relaxed grip on the pike shows no fear or
alarm. A blood red aura sparkles around the mysterious intruder. His movement
is unsure and hesitant as if lost or under the influence of an intoxicant.
The vision fades as if a spell had blocked the rest of the guard's memory.
ThundrChld releases the guard from the spell. The wretch falls to the floor
unconscious.
     	"KAAOS!" The word escapes ThundrChld as if he had been punched in the
chest. "There can be but once response to this despicable act......Black
Shadow Assassins".
	Most town dwellers know of the Alley of Sorrows. Even in full daylight no
shaft of light can breach the gloom of this place. Should any go down it
delivering casks of ale or baskets of bread to the backdoors of the inns,
they find their attention irresistibly drawn to the plaque detailing the
death of a stonemason who worked on one of the buildings. Only the mage
trained would see that the plaque is charmed and that its real purpose is to
distract all notice from the small doorway on the opposite side of the alley.
	Inset one hand's breath within the wall the door has the appearance of not
having been opened since the building was constructed. The bronze bands
holding the thick door planks cut from the tree of thorns have turned
green with age. The stone arch above the door has a keystone with a small
death's head sculpted on it. Beneath this dreaded sign of the assassin stands
a figure clad in black and dark blue. Despite the lack of light it's plain
that there is more than darkness which prevents the eye from being able to focus on the
form. ThundrChld's hands move in a rhythm which only the graveyard crows
would find pleasing. The eyes in the stone death's head begin to give off a pale green
light. As the forces of his casting build, the very air is alive with a
tension that would drop a strong man to his knees. Though the door remains
closed he moves forward and passes through it. Once again the Alley of
Sorrows falls back into quiet insignificance.
	With a grace born of the dance of death the ThundrChld moves down the torch
lit passageway. 2 turns to the right, 1 to the left, 1 to the right. A single
wrong turn would result in being snared in the nets of void spawned creatures
which roam all other paths through this maze. He pauses in front of a
unremarkable section of wall and pushes. Soundlessly the wall swings inward
to reveal a vacant candle lit chamber. He knows better than to try to cross
this warded threshold. From his sleeve he pulls a dagger. The glint of  the
steel blade is muted by dried blood and poison. He tosses a scroll far into
the room and with no break in movement throws the dagger. The spinning scroll
is caught in mid air and pinned to the back of the only chair in the room.
The black ribbon around the scroll is cut allowing it to be read:......

From:  BSA DANCER      

	BSA Dancer looked up from her meditation in alarm...  She had been away
from her brothers and sisters for some time now, and was using her time
alone to hone her mage skills.
	Now, suddenly, in the midst of her peaceful sabbatical, she felt this 
tremendous pain...  Screaming in agony, breathless from the effort to
stay conscious..  Knowing in her heart only one thing could effect her
like this, her face becomes stony as unshed tears of rage glisten in her
emerald eyes.
	Throwing off her cloak, she is the picture of her beloved twin.  Auburn 
tresses cascading to her waist, deep emerald eyes, and a voluptuous 
figure that many men had died trying to possess.  
	Dancer concentrated all her energies on mindspeaking Ariel, but to no 
avail.  Concentrating her energy on her spells, she gets a faint picture
of the past days events.  Horrified that such a thing could happen to 
her twin and nephew, she shakes with rage.  Recognizing the vile creature
known as the Mad Drunk, she knows now what she must do.
	Gathering her things, she quickly teleports back to the city of 
Neverwinter.
	Striding into the BSA Barracks, Dancer draws her dagger.  Piercing an
unfurled scroll on the wall, she departs, ready for the hunt.


******************************************************************

My brothers and sisters...
I, BSA Dancer, have broken my vow 
of silence.  I cannot stand idle whilst my
twin and nephew are in such danger.  
I will hunt the realms until I locate their 
kidnapper and he dies an agonizing death 
for what he has done.  I will not rest or have peace 
until the creature known as Mad Drunk is made 
to pay for his actions against Ariel and Sagen.
I fear the only place where this can be settled is in 
the DM chamber...
  I will seek him out and challenge him at the first opportunity

******************************************************************


Quickly packing her things, Dancer leaves the barracks in a rage

	It was to be a night of bloodshed.  The guild of KAAOS had issued the
challenge to all in the realms.  Meet in Triboar at the arena, and try to send as many
members of their guild to the gate as possible.  Dancer knew that this would
be her golden opportunity.  So many KAAOS gathered in one place at one time.
The Drunk was sure to put in an appearance, for he was rarely one to miss out
on a chance to boast about his battle skills.
	Her decision was made.  This was the night she would avenge her twin's
abduction, and bring Ariel and Sagen home safely to the Shadow Alliance.  Aye, 'tis true
that she was weak and inexperienced (only an apprentice in the BSA), but she
knew that she would never be at peace until her family was safe once again.
	After looking for Mad Drunk for hours, unable to find even a trace, she began
to make sure that his fellow guild members knew of her intentions.  It wasn't
long before Hedron (self-proclaimed KAAOS God) approached her in the Triboar
Inn.  He told her that he knew of the challenge to Mad Drunk, and had another
who would be willing to take his place in the Chamber on this night,
promising her that the result would be the same no matter which cretin she fought.
	After much deliberation, Dancer decided that the most important thing was to 
retrieve Ari and Sagen as soon as possible.  The Drunk himself could wait
until later.  Agreeing to the replacement, she sat down with Hedron to work out the
terms.  There was not much haggling necessary, for Dancer's wants were
simple.
	The return of her twin and her nephew.  Her part of the bargain did require
a bit of thought...  Were she to lose this match, she must give herself to 
her opponent as his slave for the rest of the night.  Thoughts of revenge
running through her mind, she barely hesitated before agreeing.
	Hedron summoned her opponent.  Dancer stifled a giggle.  Lith1um was a very
short, very funny looking little man.  He most certainly did not look
formidable in the least, and she began to feel much more sure of herself.  They left her
to prepare for the battle, and she spent much time conferring with friends
beforehand.  Finally ready, she made her way to the Chamber.
	Upon entering, she carefully prepared for the encounter ahead, praying to
Azuth to give her guidance, and make her strong.  The battle was close.  Surprising
Lith1um, Dancer drew first blood.  The more experienced mage was able to heal
himself, however, so her effort was wasted.  Now the real battle began.
Chasing each other around the Chamber, hiding from the Kamphults and managing to do 
damage to each other at the same time.  Towards the end, both weakened 
considerably, Dancer knew that her fate was sealed.  Taking advantage of the
situation, Lith1um quickly cast 2 cause serious wounds, bringing her down
once and for all.  Dragging herself from the field, she knew that the humiliation
in store for her would be tremendous.
	Lith1um wasted no time in meeting her in Neverwinter and proclaiming himself
her master.  He tossed her a pink frilly dress and made her change from her 
normal assassin's garb.  Humiliated beyond belief, she nonetheless endured 
the ribald comments from passers by, and tried not to think of the
sickeningly sweet costume she was forced to endure.  His next little amusement was to
have her proclaim "Lith1um, you are the kewlest!" every five minutes.  Not only
did she have to say it, she had to sound like she meant it.  Waiting on Lith1um
hand and foot, massaging his back, his shoulders, even his disgusting little 
feet...  When she was told to fulfill her name and dance for him in the 
middle of the square, she thought she was beyond further degradation.  
How wrong she was...
	...Staggering to her room in the wee hours of the morning, Dancer caught a 
glimpse of herself in the glass.  Her eyes widened, and tears fell silently
down her cheeks as she took it all in...  The torn dress, disheveled hair,
dark circles under her eyes...  Knowing that she could not bear to go
through this again. This humiliation, this servitude.  She slowly walked,
mech-like, to her bed.  Lying back on the pillows, she once again found
herself praying to Azuth, this time for forgiveness.  Knowing that she had
tarnished the name BSA, that she had let her family down and would soon
be the laughingstock of the realms was more than she could take.
	Whispering softly, "Forgive me Ariel", she unsheathed her jeweled dagger
and plunged it deep into her heart.  Her life's blood spilling across her
bed, down to the floor...

	The evilest and Kewlest person in da realms (well not as kewl as his brudda),
Lith1um, watched Dancer drive the dagger through her heart from the shadows.
"KEWL", he thought as he danced out of the shadows towards the bed.  He
leaned over the corpse, ripping the dagger free of the BSA's heart, blood
spraying over him. 
	"KEWL, WHEEEEEEEE!!", the little man screamed in glee, wiping the BSA's life
blood out of his eyes.  Lith1um, grabbed her corpse, slingin it over his
shoulder, and made his way out of the Dancer's room at Striders Tavern.  He
paused long enough to throw a note on the bed...

	The Drunk walks confidently into the Shadow Alliance stronghold carrying a
bag in his hand.  He throws the wet sack onto the floor as he turns to leave.
The decapitated head of BSA Jackal rolls out of the bag onto the marble
floor.  Mad Drunk slows as he nears the gateway, then turns back towards the
complex.  
	"WHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!", the Drunken God screams at the top of his lungs.

Subj:  Lager
Date:  96-06-23 18:57:40 EDT
From:  Hedron          

	Hedron whistled as he strolled into the hell hole.  It had been a good day.
Slaughter had ruled and death was everywhere in the realms.  Good people were
screaming in rage and agony.  Yaas, it had been a good day.
	Almost good enough to do as Drunk had requested, and look in on that little
brat that Drunk had brought by.  The weak child of a mortal, the mewling
thing was nothing more than treasure gained in the usual pursuit of blood and
souls.  Treasure, and a red hot spike to shove beneath the toe nails of the
SA.
	The Shadow Alliance was disturbed by the Drunk's kidnapping of Ariel Zwei and
her child..  He'd heard them shouting back and forth in some council meeting
earlier that day as he'd gone by the SA stronghold.  The words "The Plan!
The Plan!" kept rising above the overall turmoil.  In fact, for a second,
Hedron could have sworn that he saw a small dark midget in all white armor
pointing toward the sky and screaming it.  But no, that's ridiculous.
	Ah well, it was no concern of his.  Afterall, if the SA wanted to try and
sneak into the Hell Hole, it only meant that they'd soon discover how much
harder it was to get OUT than IN.
	Stopping his march at the door behind which Ariel was being kept, Hedron
crashed through the portal and walked up to her cell.  The tortured mortal
glared at him like a wet and beaten cat from under staggled hair.  Ah, the
sight of her misery brought a smile to his face.
	The cell was quickly unlocked, and the bedraggled woman yanked out to stand
before him by two KAAOS slaves.
	"Woman.  I'll take you to see your child.  But first you must be prepared
properly."  With that, Hedron hefted the twisted cross, spun Ariel around,
and in one shredding swing, tore a split down the back of her clothes from
top to bottom.  "Take those rags off her, bind her hand and foot, and gag
her," he said to the air as he turned his back on the filthy mortal.
	Ariel, for her part, only breathed in shocked gasps, as she dealt with the
trauma of being told she may see her child while at the same time being
stripped of clothes and dignity.  She managed only to breath out, "Who is
this man?"
	One of the malformed slaves answered her in a quiet voice as he bound and
gagged her naked body, "He is the Lord Hedron.  False Prophet of KAAOS.
There is no more cruelly calculating God in KAAOS.  He and Drunk sometimes
share victims.  I'll offer you only this advice.  Should you have the chance,
before he begins whatever he plans, impale yourself on his cross.  Death is
always the better option with him."
	In a louder voice, the talkative slave announced, "She's ready, Lord."
Hedron, at the sound of that, turned in one flowing motion, and embedded one
of the points of his cross into the skull of the slave with a wet thud.  He
turned to the remaining slave and spoke as he jiggled the weapon from the
head of the dead one. "Take her to the child's chambers, and chain her to the
farthest wall.  Hang this amulet around her neck.  It will sap her of all her
energy, leaving only enough to watch and breathe...  And slave?  Try not to
talk so much as this other one.  A loose tongue must often be cured by
religion," he said as he hefted the twisted cross.
	The slave only nodded and obeyed.
	Hedron cut a door in the dimensions, and that led to the room where the
child, "Lager," lay. He laughed as he thought of it.  Only Drunk would take
the time and the effort to name some foul little mortal gutter snipe,
"Lager."
	With a wave of his hand, he darkened the room to a pitch black that no mortal
eye could see through, but the vision of the False Prophet could not be
denied.  He strode up to the small, barred and barbed cage in which the
infant was contained.  The child's tiny hands grasped open and closed on the
dirty rags that it lay on, and it gurgled and whimpered as all mortal
children do.
	Hedron was disgusted.
	He looked down at the weak worm, shook off his disgust, and smiled as he
reached down and handed this thing his twisted cross.  The baby's grip
tightened around the black steel of the cross, and it froze.  Its mind was
sucked in, for the moment anyway, to the maelstrom of the cross.  It was in a
silent struggle, and one which its tiny mind could not win.
	As Hedron straightened, the woman Ariel was brought in, bound, gagged, and
naked, the amulet hanging around her neck leaving her slack jawed and
drooling.
	The slave, with the help of some other worthless knave he'd picked up on the
way, quickly chained the woman to the farthest wall and exited.
	The room was black as the underbelly of hell's worms, and the woman could see
nothing.  Hedron stood stock still and listened to the breathing of the
mortal mother and the child.  It amused him that they were so close to each
other, and yet did not know it.
	With a decisive walk, Hedron strode over to the mother, and reached down,
cupping the top of her head in one hand.  He felt her neck muscles tighten in
reaction, but with the amulet on, that was all she could do.  In a heavy
surge, he began feeding his black sight into the head of this victim of
Drunks.  Suddenly, in shades of deepest black, she could see.  And if there
were other Gods than those of KAAOS, she prayed to them.  Prayed that what
she saw was not real.
	But it was.
	In her minds eyes, she saw her child in his hovel of a cage, with the twisted
cross gripped in its hands.  From that cross she saw the evil influence of
KAAOS spreading over and through the child... her mortal mind captured it in
the only way it could.  She saw thousands and thousands of maggots slowly
creeping over the body of her child.  She saw them crawling into the ears and
mouth of the helpless baby.  She saw them infesting its brain, and looking
out of its eyes... SHE SAW THEM!!!! AND THEY HAD HER CHILD!!!!!!!!!!!
	Just as her mind tried to slip into fenzied insanity, Hedron fed a sudden
surge into her brain, and knocked her out.  He reached down and unchained her
to take her back to her cell.  As he lifted her, he felt her tears dripping
off her face, and he reached one finger out to lay on her eyeball.  For a
single moment, she flickered into consciousness, and Hedron poured this
thought into her mind...
	"No child, don't cry.  Your tears only boil away on the twisted cross.  It's
your blood that soaks in deep.  Your blood."

-----------------------------------------------{S Twisted -------------------------------------------------------------

	With that, he retrieved his cross, and returned Ariel to the secure cell in
which Drunk had kept her.

Subj:  Busy night for the SA brat.
Date:  96-06-23 23:36:19 EDT
From:  Slayve          


	Slayve made his way through the twisting corridors of the Hell Hole, intent
on finding what he sought.  He slowly crept to the top of the stairs which
led down to "Malhavok's Lab of Wicked Miracles".  The Glyphs and Wards placed
upon the lock were known to him, as well as to all KAAOS, and he banished
them with a blink and descended into the inky blackness below.  His
demon-eyes adjusted to the dark instantly and walked purposefully to the
small cage which hung from the ceiling.  Slayve looked up but could not see
inside the cage from his position.  Slayve growled loudly, bowed his head,
shrugged his shoulders, and his demonic wings cracked through the surface of
his back, pushed his spine inward, and spread to their full 15 foot span.  
	Blood flowed down his back, as he ascended to the cage on leathery, black
wings.  He arrived to it, near the ceiling and peered inside the cage.  A
swollen lump lay inside, barely recognizable.  It was the DemonChild of
KAAOS.
	Sylphee's ill fated brat, stolen by Malhavok, resurrected by Doc Krypto and
spawn of DemoGorgon, Prince of Demons.  Now here lay the DemonChild.
Discarded at the whim of KAAOS, as they grew bored with it.
	"It has been too long, young one" spoke Slayve as he floated nearer the cage.
The lump lashed forward suddenly and ill-shaped, yet razor sharp hands clawed
at him from within the cage.  No eyes were evident, but Slayve felt the hate
emanate from the DemonChild.  
	"I see the life essence of DemoGorgon flows through you still, child" said
Slayve as he watched the DemonChild savagely claw the cage.  "We've grown
weary of you, but perhaps another can benefit from your Royal blood".
	He spoke a silent word and the cage burst open, while the DemonChild was
pinned to the floor of the contraption.  Slayve hovered over the cage,
produced a small needle and stuck it into the DemonChild even as it tried to
raise itself to lash out.  He stuck the DemonChild with the needle, floated
backwards out of the cage, and closed it once again with a mental word.  

---Later---

	Slayve arrived in little Lager's chambers.  He sniffed the air and a familiar
scent of evil hung in the air.  Hedron had been here recently.  "But why"? he
thought.  He looked around the dank chamber but no sign of the False Prophet
or of the twisted cross.  He dismissed it for the moment and made his way to
the crib where Lager lay.
	Looking down upon the Shadow Alliance child, Slayve grinned his wicked grin
and produced the needle from beneath his SOL-skin cloak.  The child gurgled
and whimpered as he looked at it, and it nearly made Slayve wretch.  Human
babies were nearly as pathetic as human adults.  He swallowed down the bile
which rose in his throat and stuck the child in the neck with the needle.
The child screeched, but Slayve pushed the end of the needle and it's
contents into the neck of the screaming brat that squirmed in it's crib.
	"And when you are older, the blood of DemoGorgon will draw you to me, and in
turn to KAAOS" spoke the Demon God.
	The baby wailed loudly as Slayve withdrew the needle and licked the blood
from the end of it.  His good deed done for the day, Slayve left the room and
the Shadow Alliance child, which still screeched in agony from it's crib.
Sweet agony.

Subj:  The Shadow Child
Date:  96-06-23 23:54:51 EDT
From:  BSA Death       

	The BSA breathed fresh air as he was released by an unknown source.  Having
not seen the outer world in well over a year, the BSA quickly basked in the
darkness of night.  He had been locked away and forgotten, for having killed
one of his own.  Now his mysterious liberator having released him, had given
him an order to be carried out immediately.  The order was one that only he
could carry out, but this order was to be his last, for his liberator
promised he would finally be free.   He quickly began his preparations while
the rest of the guild slept for none but his mysterious liberator was aware
of this course of action.  The guild having taken to building an elaborate
plan that was about to unfold would not stand for what was about to happen.
So the BSA had to work quickly.  He gathered the 1 weapon he would need a
dagger and quickly headed out of the Shadow complex.  Once outside he cast a
spell of teleportation through dimensions.  He arrived inside the hellhole in
the very same room the Shadow child was kept.  The child having seen him
looked in his direction, the BSA took the child out of its cage and sat it on
the floor.  The child looked into the BSA eyes with the glitter of innocence
in all newborns.  Then with a swift motion the BSA buried his dagger in the
child’s skull directly in between his eyes.  BSA Death smiled methodically,
his mission half complete the child was dead, now for the final phase which
would finally bring his life in full circle.  He quickly cast another spell
of teleportation between the dimensions and arrived inside the cell of
Arielzwei.  Seeing the shademistress for the first time since his trial at
the banishment, he spit at her and would love nothing more than to kill her
were she lay.  But his liberator had a strange control over him and he needed
to complete his mission to finally be free.  With that in mind he began the
final phase of the mission.  He knew exiting the hell hole was almost
impossible but his intentions were not to exit.  He laid Ariel before him and
began to cast the ancient spell he had been given by his liberator.  A spell
known to very few in the realms.  As he began casting a pain surged threw his
body and blood began to ooze out of his orifices, from his eyes, ears nose,
and mouth.  Boils began to grow on his skin, but he continued to cast.  Steam
raised from his skin as now it was noticeable the reason the boils were
coming to be was because his skin was indeed boiling.  But through the pain
he continued to cast.  While his body went threw these horrific stages the
body of Arielzwie shademistress of the Shadow Alliance began to fade into the
dimensions.  Finally with the last part of the spell cast, BSA Death began to
melt into a glob of flesh and blood and Ariel was transported threw the
dimensions to the out skirts of the Shadow Alliance compound.  There a young
boy was waiting to receive her, he placed her on a small donkey drawn
carriage and took her to the gates of the complex were she was taken in by
some very surprised guards.  The boy walked away and faded into the darkness
of the night till the guards could no longer see him.  Then with the wave of
a hand the boy shot into the skies like a comet, taking his place in the
stars as the god of Magic Azuth.  With that a boyish whisper could be heard,
"You have done well BSA Death, the women is safe the child is dead come home
now you are free."  Then from the rotting pile of melted skin the life-force
of BSA Death shot into the sky to join his mysterious liberator the god of
magic Azuth.  
                                                           
                                                                 THE END
                                                          Rest In Peace Sagen

                                                        The Now Dead But Free
                                                                BSA DEATH

Subj:  Lager
Date:  96-06-25 10:53:32 EDT
From:  Kr0angel        

	Angel watched from high above as the chamber of the human child had visitor
after visitor.  Hedron had come with that miserable excuse for a mother.
The twisted cross in his hands.  Hedron had given the child his gift. The 
screams of the wench filled the chamber.  Angel had almost laughed at her
agony.
	After Hedron had his full of her whimpering, they had left.  The Demon,
Slayve had also come to give the infant a gift.  Angel watched as the little human
boy's system struggled with the injection of demon blood.  Yes, this child would
grow to learn to use these gifts wisely.  For he had the best of teachers in the Hell
Hole.
	Near dawn another figure entered the room.  A dagger glowed for a second,
then cracked the child's skull. The figure turned and left just as quickly as it's
short fat legs could carry it.  Angel floated down from her vantage point.  She
felt the weak pulse of the child.  "FOOL" she whispered.  Always ensure your prey is 
dead.  Angel pulled the dagger from the boy's head, with a nasty sucking
sound it came out.  Angel leaned over the babe and kissed the wound.  Tasting the
blood that flowed from it.  The bone nit back together. Angel focused in on the small
mind.
	Whispering into the child's soul. "Remember this day little one. Remember whom
gave you gifts to make you strong.  Remember who first tried to kill you."
  Angel smiled as the babe reached for her and grasped her hair.
	"Yes, Darlin', Your new mama is here." Angel gathered up the babe and headed
for her chambers. "The sun come soon my little one. We must sleep now,
darlin'."

	"For my gift of life runs though your veins also."

Subj:  Ariel's Journey
Date:  96-06-27 13:47:10 EDT
From:  Mad Drunk       

Days ago, in the KAAOS HELLHOLE.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	The door to the KAAOS slave pen, opened, breaking the dead silence with a
loud creak.  The broken slaves scrambled to the shadows, in hope to avoid the
wrath of their master, KAAOS.  Arielzwei, the newest addition to the pens,
mimicked the other slaves and scuttled to the corner with all the speed her
beaten body could muster.  She watched in fear as the door continued to open,
and she wept openly, when Mad Drunk stepped through the door. Ignoring the
slaves huddled to his side, the Drunken god of KAAOS walked directly towards
her.  She knew her torture would continue again this day.
	Mad Drunk looked down upon Ariel, and was disappointed.  "Had Hedron already
broken her spirit?", he thought as a disgusted look crossed his face.
Finally, after watching her sob for what seemed like an eternity, the Drunk
snapped.  
	The slap rung through Arielzwei's head, temporarily waking her from her
endless babble and tears.  She looked up with anger at MD, he was the cause
behind all her troubles.  "Where is my child?", Ariel asked while wiping
tears from her eyes.
	"Your child?", Mad asked with a confused look.  "Oh you mean, 'MY CHILD'", he
continued, now pointing towards his chest.  A look of pure evil crossed his
face as he finished, "You will see my child, Lager, soon enough".
	Ariel began to scream in denial at the Drunk, but was interrupted as his
powerful hand lifted her by the scruff of her neck.  As they moved swiftly
through the KAAOS halls, she  worked frantically to keep her feet.  Several
times she fell, but the powerful grip around her neck pulled her forward,
pulled her closer to the child.  Finally they were no longer moving, and the
vice-like grip released her.  They were in the child's room.  
	"Today, I will give you a choice", the Drunk spoke as he tied Ariel to a
stone chair next to the child's crib.  "You, or the child?"
	Those last words hung in the air, as MD secured her arms and legs to the
chair.  He opened a bottle of whiskey, sipping on it while he awaited her
answer. 
	The Drunken God of KAAOS didn't have to wait long.  Moving his hands in
spellcasting, Mad Drunk formed a dimension door, to another part of the KAAOS
HELLHOLE, Doc's lab.  The doorway moved silently towards Mad Drunk and
Arielzwei, enveloping them, transporting them.  The KAAOS God and his captive
emerged in the Lab.
	Mad turned to Arielzwei, after today, you will be Shadow Alliance no longer.
His evil laughter filled the air, as he moved towards Ariel, dagger in hand.

Subj:  Re:Ariel's Journey
Date:  96-06-27 14:12:21 EDT
From:  Hedron          

	The half-wit moron slave, ITB Legion, sat in a slobbering slouch on a chair
in Malhavok's lab.  This single slave had managed to survive for years in the
Hell Hole.  It was not through any great possession of intelligence.  In
fact, Legion was probably the most pathetically stupid slave in KAAOS's
stable.
	No, it was through no great ability that Legion survived, it was instead
through focused application.  He seldom thought, but when he did, he thought
about only one thing - "What do my KAAOS Lords require of me?"
	THAT, you worthless mortals, is  the only virtue a mere human is capable of.
Note it well lest you someday end up in the slave pits of the Hell Hole.
	On this particular evening, Legion was jerked awake by a familiar sensation.
A KAAOS Lord was preparing to transport into the Lab.  Legion quickly wiped
the sleep drool from his mouth with his sleeve, and rushed to the center
operating table.
	"Oh yes.. yessss.  Must clean the Lab.  Make room for the next victim."
Grabbing the lifeless body of BSA Dancer, he quickly scuttled, like a
pathetic crab, from the room.  He disappeared through the doorway just as The
Drunk flashed into existence, holding the limp for of Ariel by the neck.
Some mayhem was planned for that evening, and most of KAAOS's mayhem was best
not seen by slaves.  They tended to die so often in the working of it.
	As the noise of Drunk's evil bellowing faded behind him, ITB Legion slowed
his quick pace, and paused to wipe the snot from his nose.  Now that the
immediate danger had passed, it was time to think about where he was going.
He know that Lord Mad Drunk was probably not done with this corpse.  After
all, it was in near perfect condition.  And besides, it looked EXACTLY like
that living toy he had been playing with so much lately.  He probably wanted
the matched set.
	Legion's dull brain percolated.  Somewhere under the mush, he knew that this
corpse was not to be disposed of yet, but what should he DO with it?  As he
stood there, lost in the thoughts of a moron, another slave came wandering
by.  WELL, Legion knew an out when he saw one.
	"You there!  Come here, now!" snarled Legion.  (Oh yes, he was quite the big
man among the sniveling slaves.  I guess every small fish likes a small
pond.)  The newbie slave came scampering up with an anxious look on his face.
	"Yes, Legion?"
	"Take this corpse, and put it in safe keeping!" bellowed Legion with the
fierce roar of... oh, let's face it, of a wet diaper.
	"Yes Legion.  Where shall I..."  But Legion cut off the words of the slave
with a slap that contained as much raw power as your average stirge.
	"Don't question me.  Just get it done."  And the pompous slave stalked off.
	The poor inexperienced slave just shrugged, and began dragging the body.  He
knew where this one belonged.  He'd heard the other slaves speaking of the
holding cell in which ArielZwei was being kept.
	Too bad for this slave that he didn't know that this was BSA Dancer, Ariel's
twin.  But how was he to know?  They were identical!  In fact, they were even
dressed exactly the same!
	As the slave clanged shut the door to Ariel's cell... now filled with the
body of Dancer, he turned to walk out.  Had he but paused for a moment, he
might has seen a certain BSA Death flash into the room.
	Had he but waited, he might have seen BSA Death melt himself into a puddle of
goop in order to transport the soulless corpse of a murdered BSA out of the
Hell Hole.
	It's too bad he didn't wait.  He probably would have found it almost as funny
as the KAAOS Gods would when they discovered the melted fool.

From:  RELL1KK         

	Spritzer!  The smoke-stained rafters shook as the deep-throated roar went up.
Mugs made of human skulls clashed and dagger hilts beat upon the ebony marble
table.  Knives hacked at the great joints of human carcasses and under the
feet of revelers, a gaunt, ill kept child by the name of Lager fought with
hell hounds over the remnants of the God’s feast.
	At the head of the dark table set RELLIKK, DreadLord of KAAOS, Leader of the
evilest band of cutthroats ever assembled in Neverwinter.  The huge God swept
the unruly blond hair out of his steel gray eyes as he arrogantly scanned his
domain.  
	A score of Gods and Goddess feasted here, waited on by bold eyed women and by
trembling ITB Slaves.  Riches from all over Neverwinter were flung about in
careless abandon.  Rare tapestries and scrolls, bales of silk and spice,
jewels and gems of untold value, corpses and heads of various goodie heroes;
all lay scattered about the chamber.
	The DreadLord’s eyes ranged about the room in satisfaction.  No guild leader
could boast a fiercer assortment of warrior mages than he.  A ferocious
fearless group they were, with a latent madness burning in their brains,
ready to leap into terrible flame at an instant.
	Tho he was the Singles and Doubles Champion of Neverwinter, The Son of Bane
had to be ever vigilant around this gang of cutthroats.    As RELLIKK’s gray
eyes swept the room……..they rested for a second on the God known as Mad
Drunk, busily engaged in flaying what once was a young drow child and feeding
the strips of flesh to the young creature known as Lager. 
	This was one who strove for the ultimate power in Neverwinter. This  was
one RELLIKK would have to watch closely…………..or  destroy.

Subj:  sorrow

From:  ArielZwei       

	Ariel paces back and forth in her cell, a look of sorrow permanently affixed
to her face.  There is still fire in her emerald eyes, but the light is
beginning to fade from them.  It has been a week since she has seen her
beloved son or her family.  Mad Drunk and these other ghoulish creatures have
been her only company.
	Days ago, whilst lying on the cot provided for her comfort (hah!), she woke
with a start...  Perspiration beading her forehead and she felt a agony so
enormous, she realized it could only mean one thing.  Jumping from her
makeshift bed, she ran to the door and began screaming for the Drunk.   One
of the KAAOS toadies answered her calls, and after pleading with him for what
seemed like hours, he agreed to find MD and deliver her message.
	Finally making himself available to her, the Drunk swaggered into her cell.
A look of vast amusement in his eyes, he asked her what she needed.  Beating
her fists into his chest and screaming at the top of her lungs, she demanded
that he take her to see BSA Dancer.  Fastening a chain around her neck, he
pulled her from the cell and dragged her further into the hellhole.
	Leading her to a dark and dank room deep in the bowels of the hellhole, the
Drunk pushed her inside, slamming the door and whispering harshly, "5
minutes".  Walking slowly to a table placed in the middle of the room, Ariel
could see the silhouette lying there.  Tears streaming down her cheeks she
looked into the face that mirrored her own.  Noticing the torn dress and
bruises on her twin's body, she began to shake with rage.  Using trembling
hands to brush the hair from Dancer's face, straighten the ruined dress, she
whispered softly, "I love you my sister, go with Azuth".  Placing a soft kiss
on her twin's forehead, she summoned the devil that had brought all of the
about.
	Dragging her back to her cell, the Drunk delighted in telling her how well
her precious Sagen was adjusting to life in the Hellhole.  Stopping at the
entrance to her prison, the Drunk pushed her roughly inside.  Tossing a dress
into the room, he looked at her, a nasty gleam in his eye, and said, "Get all
prettied up Ariel...  you and I are hitting the town this evening".
Chuckling evily, he left her.
	The night was balmy and breezy..  Mad Drunk walked proudly into the square
and trailing behind him, a silver chain around her neck, walked ArielZwei.
If anyone were surprised to see this duo, they wisely kept it to themselves.
MD had a horrendous temper when riled, and even chained as she was, Ariel
could be quite formidable herself.
	It soon became apparent to all present however, that this was not a pleasure
outing.  Not for Ariel, at least.  The Drunk wasted no time in informing the
gathering that Mrs. Zwei was now his captive, and that he held her son deep
within the hellhole.  He seemed to get the most pleasure out of making her
angry.  Angry enough to spit on him, to slap his face.  Finally, she realized
that she had gone too far, when he looked at her and whispered evenly, "one
more slap from you and the child dies.  Do you understand me?".  Looking into
his eyes, she could see the rage burning there.  Nodding her head, she
quickly agreed.
	Looking down and taking her hand, Mad Drunk smiled wickedly and told her,
"ArielZwei, tonight you are in for a treat!" Laughing with delight he
continued, "Tonight you fight side by side with KAAOS!  Prepare yourself for
battle, and don't forget what I said about the child!"
	Looking up at him, resignation in her eyes, Ariel did as she was told.

Subj:  Ariel
Date:  96-06-28 17:20:33 EDT
From:  ArielZwei       

	Ariel's eyelids fluttered as she slowly regained consciousness.  She
could feel the weight of something against her face, covering her.
Clawing with her fingers, and finally managing to free herself from this
shroud, she looks around her.
	She is in what appears to be a cellar of some sort.  It is not the cell
she has been used to these last weeks.  What on earth could have
possessed them to move her here, she wonders.  Well, she'll soon find
out!  Striding across the cold stone floor to the heavy door, she 
begins to pound.  A guard finally comes, and shrieking in terror, flees
to find the Drunk.
	Puzzled by the guards obvious fright, Ariel inspects her new quarters
more closely.  Her eyes widen as she realizes that she is locked in
what seems to be a crypt.  Truly frightened now, she paces back and
forth, waiting for the arrival of the Drunk.
	Within mere minutes, the door crashes open and the Drunk stands
staring at her in disbelief.  Terrified at what appears to be his
shaking rage, she soon recognizes the sound of almost hysterical 
laughter.  Quickly grabbing her by the hand, MD drags her from the
room.

later
---------

	Sitting in an ornate room with Mad Drunk, Hedron, Slayve, and Malhavok,
Ariel's face is a picture of stunned disbelief and grief.  Raising her
face to meet that of the Drunk, she softly whispers, "And you expect
me to believe my own family capable of this tremendous betrayal?"
	"The ignorance of your guards is quite reasonable, considering the
company they keep.  I can understand how they would become confused and
switch Dancer and myself.  They are none too bright, and placing my
twins body in my cell, and my unconscious one in her crypt would seem
almost comical if not for the rest.  Can you possible expect me to 
believe your lies without proof?"
	Rising slowly, a look of triumph on his face, the Drunk looks down at
her and smiles.  "But of course I can prove your family's, and yes, your
own Husband's betrayal!"  Roughly placing his hand upon her forehead,
and uttering arcane words of magic, the MD allows her to see the events
of the last 24 hours.  Slumping into a stupor, the emotions fly across
her face at an alarming rate as the images are permanently affixed to
her brain:
	Sagen...  holding the black cross of Hedron
Her own madness at the realization of what has been done to her son
Slayve injecting the child with his vile poisons
A lone BSA striding into Sagen's room...  plunging a dagger in his skull
The same figure in her cell... teleporting her twin's body to the SA
BSA Death, dead in a heap on the floor
	Her eyes clear and she doubles over, consumed by grief.  As the sobs
wrack her body she receives no comfort from the Demon Gods.  She pounds
her fists against the Drunks chest, repeating her son's name over and
over...  She stumbles as she feels the sharp crack of MD's hand across
her face.  Looking up at him, her face is ravaged by rage and grief.
	Walking to them, Hedron holds out a glass of wine.  "Drink this Ariel,
and collect yourself.  We cannot abide weakness in the hellhole!"  Ari
sips the wine eagerly, and looks up in shocked disbelief as she hears
Hedron continue.  With a smirk on his face and in his voice he whispers
evilly.. "Perhaps we can help you..."
	Looking into the faces of the men before her, Ariel laughs derisively.
"You expect me to believe you can help me?  The only thing that would
help me is the return of my son, and he is lost to me forever! Do you
think me so desperate that I would accept your help for anything less
than having my son returned to me as he once was?"
	Leading her to a chair, and roughly pushing her down, Hedron leans over,
his face inches from hers.  "Of course we can return your son to you!  We
are Gods, are we not?  We have powers you have never even dreamed 
possible, mortal!  The question remains...  How badly do you wish for
the return of your Sagen?"
	Fearing to hope, Ariel looked at each of the men in turn.  They seemed
to be telling her the truth.  "I am desperate to have my son back, you
know that very well.  But I want him as he was before you began your 
nasty little games with him."
	Malhavok and Slayve, finally breaking their silence moved closer to her.
Speaking in turn, they explained to her exactly what they wanted from
her and exactly what she stood to gain.
	"Your son will be returned to you.  He will be the same child that you
knew before he became our guest.  You will have the privilege of
raising him as his mother, and seeing to most all of his needs.  You
will be provided with a small cottage away from the Hellhole in which
to do this," Slayve explained with exaggerated patience.
	Malhavok continued, "Your side of the agreement is also very simple.
The child will be trained by the Gods of KAAOS.  He will learn our 
battle ways, and be educated in the ways of the KAAOS Gods.  But, and
this is very important for you to remember, you must agree never again
to set foot inside the Shadow Alliance compound.  If you break this
agreement, your son will die an agonizing death, and after you are 
forced to watch, you will be given to the KAAOS slaves.  Think
carefully."
	Malhavok waved his hand, and a scroll appeared before the bewildered
Ariel.  "Simply sign in your blood, and your son will be returned to
you Ariel," he whispered in her ear.
	Closing her eyes and breathing deeply, she remembered how much she
trusted her family.  How the BSA had been responsible for the deaths
of two of her children.  How she knew in her heart that no BSA would
dare to harm her child without the approval of her husband.
	Raising her head slowly, looking at each of the men in turn, she held
out a trembling arm to Mad Drunk.  A satisfied grin on his face, he
quickly unsheathed his dagger and slashed at her arm.
	A look of resolve on her face, her blood dripping onto the stone
floor, Ariel signed.
