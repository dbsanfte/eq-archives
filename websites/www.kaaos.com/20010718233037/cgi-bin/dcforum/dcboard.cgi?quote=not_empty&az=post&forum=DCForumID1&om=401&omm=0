         <blockquote>
         I tried "ladychinabalorswife" - it says its taken. I tried all the various inbetween forms too. So I guess I'll just post here since the only person that I can identify as a bonafide adult that has expressed the verbage of a bonafide child is Myschief. I'm not really sure if she's KAAOS or not, but I know she frequents this board. And this is for all you others that chose take a moment to listen.<P>First of all - I am a roleplayer. I've always been a roleplayer. The curse of my life, and those around me in game, is that I have a random name generator churning out possible letter/personna combinations at all times of the day and night. I have never scoffed at roleplaying, and in fact the Mercs used to be the best god damned roleplayers in Yserbius. They had all kinds of behaviors based upon storylines they made up - hell in DSO they kidnapped somebody as part of a roleplaying plot line. So Delusion, who admitted that he knew nothing at all about the Mercs, is quite wrong in thinking they are not roleplayers. They roleplay chaos and evil. They disrupt ONLINE weddings because they are CHAOTIC AND EVIL. Some of the new ones don't really admit to being roleplayers, in spite of hours of brain bashing at my hands getting them to see that what they do is roleplaying even if they're not tossing out "thee's and thou's". Some of them really suck at what they do. But we're not talking about an entire guild now, we're talking about me. <P>The whole medieval wedding idea was my idea. I worked very hard on it, all my family and friends were kind enough to sigh and give in to another one of my "ideas". Balor was kind enough to sigh and give in. Nobody roleplayed anything at the wedding. Nobody used old english, it was merely a choice of dress. Everything that people wear to weddings is totally fake in my opinion from the tux to the mother of the bride's gown. Why not have people come in something that would inspire conversation and a happy little silly feeling of fun. And it DID inspire just that. Thats all I wanted, and thats exactly what I got. <P>There were no "Mercs" at the wedding. The Mercs are a guild of game players, they don't have Merc Con's, or little beer bashes. My wedding had NOTHING to do with what Balor has created and what I support online. <P>What I also support online is as much laughter and fun as possbile, its a dry and boring place without the wit and creativity and sometimes stupidity of the people that are fortunate enough to have access to this huge world made small. I'm happy that my website was able to supply some laughter, I hope maybe one or two people came away with IDEAS, which is what I truly worship - well besides Balor.<P>So lets all laugh and have fun and be cruel, but don't wrap it up in some kind of a cop out excuse of "Well, they DESERVED it!" I deserve to be killed in a game because I cannot defend myself, and I deserve to be called a moron on a board because I called somebody else a stupid asshole. I deserve to have my website and my memories mocked because I made it public, and I run with a real rough crowd. But NOT because I'm a hypocrite that doesn't roleplay but has a period wedding.<P>Get it? Got it? GOOD.<P>*smirks* (ala Warlord's wench, sorry can't remember your name) ;p It'll bug me for the rest of the night, damn it...
