----------------------------------------------------
I am the GM of war guild on GL. We currently have 6 members. 4 of these are 7x, 2 5x. We take on guilds of 80+ on a consistant basis. Couple of reasons for that. First, newbie fuckwads put every character they have in the same guild. So, divide that membership by 5. That gives you less then 16 actual players. More then half of them are never on at the same time, that makes that number 8. Any given three of us are more then capable of taking those 8 down. When the prime time nights roll around we generally all show, making our numbers a full 100%, the fuckwads still can't get anywhere close to 100% of membership cause you can only be on one chr at a time. 

Our requirements are being able to solo a deamon in a cage fight (tough for the mages, easy for the warriors), soloing a bally in the open (easy for the mages, hard for the warriors), and being able to take down ancient worms in pairs (plain hard if your not team oriented), any pair. If you join up with us and pull bone head shit when we are in PVM combat, like holding the ophid fort, we know you will do the same in PVP and you are no longer with us. We play as a group. If my health bar is red lining I have faith that my backup will get that heal there, and I can continue on offense and vice versa when a warrior leads and I back him up. He knows I will cure that poison and get the heal in, he knows it and he keeps on the planned target. 

When the wars were in full swing we had well over 15 guilds we were warred with, the smallest being HSS (now dead and gone) House StoneSoul. H<G, (Highland Guard), HSS, =B= (First Army of Britania), and some other bunch of newbified fucks all camped the Skara bank and waited for us. Over 25 of them, waiting in ambush in town so we couldn't use feild spells (God we used to fuck em up by the masses outside of town). Me, Son Goku, Magus Merlin, and Shroom Boy took all 25 of them down. I've got the screen caps. =B= disbanded that evening, HSS lasted like three more days, and the other newbified fucks all quit thier guild so fast I never even actually knew the name of the guild. Together thier membership total was prolly 250+. We had rules, Role Play before comabt, they broke those rules to try to get screen caps of us dead. We retaliated in horrible fasion, camping their tower and killing on sight as they tried to do us. The 4 of us took down three large guilds and made the 4th peace us within 3 days. H<G is still around, and the leader of then HSS is as well. To this day there can be any number of them in town and I can walk up alone, outnumbered 6,8-1 and they won't say boo to me. 

So.. does guild size matter?

Yes. The large guilds with masses of stupid fucks will always.. let me repeat that for you ALWAYS, lose to smaller groups of well organized players. 

If there is anything I have learned from Kaaos, ITB, Ark, ToM, CvN, hell even the Syndicate's (LLTS for those who don't know) war stone is the that tight groups of smaller players will always prevail. ALWAYS.
