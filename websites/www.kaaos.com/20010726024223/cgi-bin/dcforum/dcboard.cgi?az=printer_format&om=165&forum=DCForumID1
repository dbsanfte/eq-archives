<blockquote>This is some funnnnnny stuff..<P>We musta held the bridge in EK for 4 hours tonight.  Everyone must have been petitioning becuase what shows up?  A GM NPC.  LOL  ANd for the first 10 mins or so... he was INVULERABLE and attacking us.  We unloaded 2 full bars a piece on him.. that is a total of about 16 bars of mana.  Not a scratch.  Here he is:<P><img src="http://home.swbell.net/coryhawk/eq/gm1.jpg"><P>He then takes off the Invul and we proceed to kick the shit outta him.. he gets down to about 1/4 HPS (which took forever) and he takes off running... at about 4x the speed of SOW.  LMAO!  The runs all over the zone healing and then finally gives up and disappers.&lt;p&gt;YEAH for US   we have fought off the GM and won!  Or have we?<P><BR>Next..  3 Brab red cons show up.  They are GM's aswell.  They start laying waste to us without warning.  They kill Tk about ohh.. 3 times.  While camping his corpse. They wouldn't let him loot!  Here is the conversation with them and the Senior guide I was bitching at.  The funny part is they started to roleplay like it was an event,  after attacking us and killing TK twice.<P><img src="http://home.swbell.net/coryhawk/eq/gm2.jpg"><BR><img src="http://home.swbell.net/coryhawk/eq/gm3.jpg"><BR><img src="http://home.swbell.net/coryhawk/eq/gm4.jpg"><P>We eventually kill them with the help of the entire zone.  Took about 20 people to kill these 3 Barb GMs.  They did have nice loot tho  ;)<P><P><img src="http://home.swbell.net/coryhawk/blaysig.gif"> </blockquote><hr><b><font size=2>Table of contents</font></b><hr>

<blockquote>
is to get the GMs in the zone EVERY time we do a raid.  What better form of worship?<P>Really, who gives a shit about losing experience?  It's not like we're level 60 or anything.  Who gives a shit about GMs kicking our asses while invulnerable?  Hell, we have the screenshots to back up our claims that they couldn't be hurt.  Who gives a shit about whether or not they think we zone camped or heard we zone camped?  If you look at the screenshots (I have a couple), you'll notice that there are exactly 2 bodies NEAR the zone line.  One was a druid that we had to kill a second time because he was casting on us AFTER he zoned in.  The other is a guy that was making a run for it (smile).<P>I think the GMs showed up (invisible) long before they came up with this beautiful Bridge Keeper concept.  They saw that we were dominating, WITHIN THE RULES, and decided that they STILL needed to intervene.<P>No sense in whining about it.  Let's just take this on as our new challenge:  We will kill so many people "legally" that they'll ALWAYS have to come rescue the peons.  When we take over Oasis, I'm going to ask them to come see my 10 inch dock ;p<P>Turm

Lol ya the first time the bridge keeper was there he said leave the bridge, I said no and then he proceeded to blast me with a spell that sent me flying halfway across the zone into the middle of EK. He did that 2 more times of which I have all the screenshots. Ahhh what fun.<P><P><BR>SangDraxx<BR>KAAOS<BR>Serpent Lord

*shrugs* Nothing to bitch about IMO, I mean... who really cares anyways.  Would you rather knock around people who dont stand a chance and who you will get lousy loot from, or fight a couple of GMs who actually make you work a bit for the kill?  If they would have stayed Invul the whole time that would have been BS, but they didnt.  Remember, having to actually earn your keep isnt gay, whining constantly is.

<BR>So far, as a guild, our comments have been:<P>1) Let's try and make them do this every time, it was cool<P>2) They shouldn't have been Invulnerable, and<P>3) WHEEEE!! We killed them!<P>That's whining?  What culture did you grow up in, goat-boy?<P>As for what we'd rather have?<P>We'd rather have the GMs not need to do anything.  We'd rather see an organized and cohesive PLAYER group form up to fight back.<P>Organized resistance.  That's what's fun.<P>And it's not some pipe dream.  We weren't killing people who had no chance.  We were killing people who needed to get organized to face us, and they didn't.<P>And trust me, several guilds on the server are even now mobilizing in reaction to our random killing to draw some real battle lines.<P>But if you want to start a fight, you gotta punch somebody in the nose. ;)<P>So what do you want from us?<P><BR>Hedron<BR><a href="http://www.kaaos.com/hedron/falseprophet.htm" target="_blank">The False Prophet</a><BR><a href="http://www.kaaos.com" target="_blank">KAAOS</a><P>...No child, don't cry.

Hrm, "Goatboy", been a while since I've gotten such a compliment.  Anyhow, your point about players gathering together and fighting back is nice in theory, but not one that will be easily accomplished.  Of course thats not your fault, it is just hard in PSWs to get involvement in the form of massive battles.  Timezones, real life, etc, tend to defeat the practicality of huge planned battles.  But, by all means, Good luck in drawing them into battle en mass.  IF that doesnt work out, atleast the Guerilla warfare might be fun.

Hey dumbass - what the hell do you think just occurred at the bridge?<P>Timezones, real life, etc - were ALL coordinated by the fellas that took and HELD the bridge.  Did anyone rush to get a large group together?  No.  Did they have time?  Hours.<P>It does not take that much coordination to get a group of players together to either create evil, or fight evil.  All it takes is someone with half a brain, and a good plan.<P>Soulie

Is that why everyone just runs around by themselves until they find some stranger to twink/buff/give them shit, and whine if they don't?<P>Fact is, most of the really hugely enormous gargantuan FLAMING UBERGUILDS FROM PLANET X are in EQ. Granted, most of them are banding together to do things other than PvP (camping items, slaying huge monsters,) but why drag 'em down for accomplishing what seemed like a good idea at the time?<P>&gt;But, by all means, Good <BR>&gt;luck in drawing them into <BR>&gt;battle en mass.  IF <BR>&gt;that doesnt work out, atleast <BR>&gt;the Guerilla warfare might be <BR>&gt;fun. <P>You'll go to great lengths if you get bored enough and remain a MMORPG addict. These guys have known each other way too damned long not to stir shit up. Never thought they'd be going to EQ of all places, but I never really thought about it that hard.<P>Now, it's like, why not? Beats these guys spending my annual salary on booze and boat rentals. They already did that once this year. At least this way no one really gets hurt.<P>J.<BR>damned vulpine<BR><a href="http://sb.drtwister.com/" target="_blank">http://sb.drtwister.com/</a>

If you want to get technical, guides are never allowed to fight with players. (I am not quite sure on full GMs but I believe that if they are going to fight with players it is a Verant approved quest or event only.)  I know of at least one incidence where guides were "released" from service for fighting players.  <P>*shrug*  I may be incorrect but I believe that is the way of it.<P>WhiteWolf Shadowstalker (aka Sachant-EQ/TZ)<BR>Mistress of Soulz<BR>Knight of the Undead Lords <BR>www.undeadlords.net
