You always were a fucking retard. 

No, it’s not the “anals of KAAOS history”. You want to get technical? Let’s get technical gimp. First of all anals is not a word, it’s spelled annals. Secondly “annals of KAAOS history” is redundant you stupid cunt. Do you even know what annals means? You mean to tell me you come here to correct me?....ME?!! And you don’t even know what the word means. 

What I find most amusing is that you’ve been worshiping at our temple long enough.....You should know by now that if you are going to correct me, me of all people, you had better be SURE of what you are correcting. 

And as far as my testosterone, testosterone has nothing to do with anything. You think I give a fuck about what you think about me? You think I give a fuck about who’s gay or what “looks gay”? This isn’t happy, skippy, fairy land. I don’t give a fuck about anything except spitting on your rotting corpse. You post here at your own risk. If you come here you better accept the fact that we would just assume piss on you as look at you. I don’t give a fuck about you, I don’t give a fuck about “old buds”, and I certainly don’t give a fuck about your precious sensitivities. You can take your little holier than thou attitude and shove it up your ass. 

As far as my reply to Lumen, if he truly was a KAAOSer then he understands my post. 

You on the other hand are a dumb ass and you obviously have no shame, because if you cared about yourself on any level you would do yourself a favor and put a bullet in your head.
