          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">“...mmm...mmmercy 

            lord,” mushed the bloody gash of its mouth. </font></p>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">A sickening crunch. 

            </font></p>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">FORCE and DEATH 

            - BURNING and DESTRUCTION - EVIL and FURY</font></p>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> ....betrayal....</font></p>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> THESE THINGS 

            SCREAM OUT AT YOU. </font></p>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">These things 

            pour from the veins of the dying. The human force - fired and tempered, 

            boiled and extracted, concentrated and eviscerated from the body like 

            the guts being pulled from cattle for the slaughter. Long messy strings 

            of the essence of life yanked out fistful by fistful, dripping with 

            the blood and slop of the creature giving up its spark. </font></p>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">These are the 

            things that punch through human existence, and make their indelible 

            scar on the skin of each damned mortal soul. </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">These 

            are the things that stand above every other human experience.</font></p>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">When a mortal 

            slumbers, these things... THEY are what is felt in the deep night 

            of sleep.</font></p>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Sleep, that mimicry 

            of death. Even death is pierced by suffering. </font></p>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">These things.... 

            these things.... they matter. </font></p>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">And this is a 

            fact. A fact that The False Prophet had come to know. But it had not 

            been easy to learn.</font></p>

          <hr>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> Fire from a 

            thousand pits. That was all his eyes saw. Fire from a thousand pits, 

            burning on the fuels of rage and loss and pain and grief. The smoke 

            that curled into the air was greasy and black with the despair of 

            those who roasted in the fires below. </font></p>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">This was the 

            world. </font></p>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">This was the 

            wreckage of the world.</font></p>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> His nostrils 

            flared as he drew in the smell of destruction, and the sky was red 

            to him, and his soul was dark to him. </font></p>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Yaas.... </font></p>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Hedron stood 

            in the crushed ruin of a temple, outlined in shadow and firelight 

            against the night. His body was taut with a power that he had held 

            contained for centuries. His hands gripped and ungripped in a restless 

            kind of ritual, and he turned toward the boy. </font></p>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The boy, for 

            his part, looked up at Hedron with confused, but confident eyes. After 

            all that had happened, this boy still trusted Hedron, still trusted 

            The Prophet. And this boy was the very last. </font></p>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">But the child 

            knew he was safe. It was this immortal being, The Prophet, who had 

            built, guided and ruled the land for longer than any living memory 

            or written record stretched back. The Prophet had ruled since aeons 

            before this boy had come from the ether of pre-birth. He had ruled 

            for so long that the trust of the people was like a religion. The 

            people believed in him. Had believed in him. Unquestionably. </font></p>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">But their lord 

            had been quiet for centuries, and when he reappeared to the people, 

            he was almost... almost a legend. Old men and women had long dead 

            grandparents who had last seen The Prophet in flesh, and they told 

            tales of him to their grandchildren. Grandchildren who were now grandparents 

            themselves, and were the last to know direct reports of the glorious 

            Prophet. When he reappeared the people revered him as they had before, 

            feeling at last that a piece they had been missing had come back into 

            place. </font></p>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">It wasn’t until 

            after they were dead that their severed souls began to question what 

            had happened.</font></p>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> And now here 

            was the last of the people. A child before his... his God. There was 

            no other way to put it.</font></p>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> Hedron crouched 

            down low, and faced the boy. “Child,” he whispered, “do you know why 

            men build?” </font></p>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The child shook 

            his head. “Child, men build because they know they are mortal. They 

            seek to make something greater than themselves. Something great enough 

            to carry their essence, some part of themselves, down through the 

            ages.” The child watched, and listened, but he did not understand. 

            </font></p>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">“And so men build, 

            child. And I have seen the results of their work. Do you know what 

            that result is? It is nothing. Statues, monuments, temples, ideas, 

            religions, art, literature, laws, governments. All of it becomes dust 

            eventually. Oh, something new is always built, but nothing nothing 

            nothing lasts. Did you know that child?” The child shook his head 

            no. He had not known that, but now that his Prophet had told him, 

            now he knew it. </font></p>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Hedron smiled, 

            somehow cruelly, and said “But there is one thing that lasts. I last. 

            I have endured. Throughout time I have existed, and all things inside 

            me have existed, and all things without me crumble.” </font></p>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Hedron reached 

            out one hand and took the arm of the child and led him deeper into 

            the heart of the temple they were in. “This is the center of the Land. 

            This temple is where the heart and soul of the entire People rests. 

            Come with me and I will show it to you.” </font></p>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">They walked together, 

            the image of a father and his son. Stone columns that had collapsed 

            made grinding noises as they parted before the two and debris cleared 

            itself away. The two of them eventually reached the nexus of the temple, 

            and gazed at a brightly throbbing Cross, its white light bathing them. 

            </font></p>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The light rested 

            on the child like the hand of a mother, and it glared off of Hedron 

            The Prophet like his touch revolted it. Hedron reached out a gray 

            gloved hand, and tore the cross from the deep rich earth it was rooted 

            in, and hefted it like a mace. The white light grayed and dimmed at 

            his touch, and the cross almost seemed to... to whimper. </font></p>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">“Child, do you 

            know what the People have made that will last forever? They have made 

            the memory of their suffering and death root itself in my mind. And 

            I, and my memory, will live forever. Do you understand that in dying, 

            the People have finally achieved the immortality that all their building 

            could never grant them?”</font></p>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> The child, for 

            the first time, waned in his worship of The Prophet, and his eyes 

            cleared. He looked at Hedron, really looked at Hedron. He looked at 

            the set of his mouth, the piercing of his eyes. </font></p>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The silence was 

            unbearable and unbreakable in the way that the weight of a deep cavern 

            collapsing on a man might be unbearable and unbreakable. No matter 

            how desperate the need to do away with it, it would not break. </font></p>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">But break it 

            did. And it broke with tears. They streamed down the child’s face. 

            </font></p>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Hedron had what 

            he wanted. “Yes, Child. I have chosen you, the last of the People, 

            to know it. To know more than the agony of torture, and the despair 

            of death that I gave to the others. I have chosen you to know betrayal. 

            I have betrayed you.” </font></p>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The child’s face 

            flowed with tears, and a small sob broke his clenched jaw open. Hedron 

            whispered... “No child. Don’t cry. Your tears only boil away on the 

            Twisted Cross. It’s your blood that soaks in deep.... your blood.” 

            </font></p>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Hedron reached 

            under the chin of the boy, and tightened his grip. </font></p>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">“NOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!” 

            </font></p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">“NOOO!!!!! YOU 

            CAN’T!!!!!!!!!!!” </font></p>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">“YOU CAN’T!!!!YOU

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">“...mmm...mmmercy 

            lord,” mushed the bloody gash of its mouth.</font></p>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> A sickening 

            crunch. </font></p>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">A crunch as the 

            cross that had been pulled from the ground and pulled from the heart 

            of the Land by Hedron smashed into the head of the boy, the last of 

            the People. As it struck, the white light died, and the arms of the 

            cross were twisted horribly by the impact with the skull. </font></p>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The Twisted Cross 

            was born as Hedron absorbed from the child all that was the People 

            and the Land. And he whispered again from between ragged breaths...</font></p>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> “I am Hedron. 

            The Prophet is no more. I am The False Prophet.” His shuddering, convulsing 

            body crashed to the ground, and the Twisted Cross melted itself into 

            his soul, making itself and its sins his companion forever. </font></p>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Later, much later, 

            he rose, and moved on toward other worlds. The Twisted Cross swung 

            at his side, and the cruel power of the destruction of a world hid 

            in his body. </font></p>
