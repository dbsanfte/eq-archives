<blockquote>Your thoughts are useless.<BR>They do not provoke us to thought.<BR>They are so riddled with moronic typing errors that your message is lost in our thoughts of how absolutely stupid you must be.<BR>Even if they weren't riddled with COMMUNICATION errors, they are still useless.<BR>Why would we want to think about shit like that man?<BR>Go listen to eminem, read his lyrics, and figure out how stupid you are.  Read his old stuff first, and figure out how damn cool he is.  Then read his new stuff, and figure out how damn cool you aren't for thinking he was cool. You useless nitwit.<BR>Bother someone who wants to listen for pete's sake.<BR>Come back when you grow a few dendrites.<BR>Goodbye.<BR></blockquote><hr><b><font size=2>Table of contents</font></b><hr>

Please provide proof of more than ten mistakes over the past month and just maybe I will take a trip to my word document software more often. <P>Provide a few examples and then come back and moan and groan since more and more evil people don't care if spelling is an attribute to have.

This guy reminds me of that lil taco bell dog who follows around the big bulldog desperatly seeking approval...<P>A word of advice Geo, you won't find any approval here.  But then again, maybe you are the type who just loves getting bitch-slapped on a regular basis.<P>Logos

That taco bell dog that would follow a big bulldog?<P>If you can remember that cartoon story then it would of been funny. The big dog ends up following the small dog at the end.<P>Giving me advice but not giving me an ounce of approval. That is very nice of you. Would that be another bitch slap? ROFL!!!
