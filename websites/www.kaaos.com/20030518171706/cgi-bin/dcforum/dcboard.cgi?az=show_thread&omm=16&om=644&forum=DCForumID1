         <blockquote>
         <i>"The only way that senerio could play out is if the three people who were disabled were E-Cloaked. An item, back in the day, that allowed a significant advantage to the person wearing it. Unless, of coarse, that fight was in Southwall... maybe that's why I never saw you fucks. The members of K'wuss were certainly good pvp'ers in thier day, in that game, but citing a win where the items being worn made more difference then the skill of the players is disturbing, at best."</i><P><i>"I realize that it is possible for this to have happened, but it is to no determination of skill. For a quad to survive that they had to be faced with complete incompetence, or just have been lucky as hell."</i><P>I'm going to answer the last first. The Ark quad team fought 21 Quad fights. We never lost any of them. To clarrify it even further, in those 21 fights we only had 4 Arks killed in total. FOUR. To our Quad team, every time we stepped onto the field we faced incompetence no matter who the opponent was. And if you think we only fought the bottom of the barrel you are dead wrong. Sure, we faced some newb squads but we also fought highly regarded teams as well.  <P>As for the first comment, the fight was during the KAAOS/SATAN war. Each guild put 4 quad teams together. The war was to consist of 16 quad matches with each team fighting each other team once. Only 14 were played out, SATAN conceeded the rest. The fight locations of each match was predetermined. Some were in heavy NPC locations, some were in light. The KAAOS quad team that consisted of old Ark members fought in 3 matches. We killed all 12 opponents without taking a single casualty. The match I was refering to was the third of the matches our Quad fought. It was against SATAN's rank 2 Quad team. This match took place in the Lost Hills, in one of the huts actually. We didn't have a choice on locations. This location was NPC light. <P>In this particular fight, E-Cloaks were a non-factor. There were very few, harmless, NPCs. The layout consisted of one large main room, a short-wide hallway and a smaller room to the upper left. Tyo and Dethan were Fumbled and failed their saves in the upper left room. I tried to dispel them but they failed. I then failed a save on a fumble two rounds later. Krynal ran around like an idiot for 2 rounds, running into the wall and then ending up in the hallway. That's when I called him on the phone...."WTF are you doing?". "My mother fucking monitor is out" he replied. I told him where to move and what to cast from that point. Twice he hit 3 of them in stinking clouds (when they moved in on him to harm), preventing them from casting. He re-imaged and globed after they widdled his images down. He tried to dispel us but we all failed again. Krynal lured them close to the walls when their globes were about to drop. They almost had Krynal dead but 2 of them lined up nicely near a wall and as their globes droped Krynal rebounded an LB killing them both. Dethan and Tyo were free at that point and I was free a couple rounds later. We moped up. <P>As far as whether or not we were southwall fighters and that being the reason you never ran into us.....If you never ran into us then you were never a serious PvPer. I can assure you we fought at the most difficult locations more often than not (if it was our choice, we chose heavy NPC locations). Before I was cloaked I was the only non-cloaker in the top 10 of the PvP ladder. Just about all of the top 20 were cloaked, save for a couple. Cloakers below me would challenge cloakers above me rather than having to go through me at the location of my choice. And it wasn't because I would choose SW. I was well known for choosing 14,15 LH against cloakers which was an extremely heavy NPC location. I only ever lost against 2 people at that location (Dethan and Ivan. Both were Arks BTW). I fought well over 300 recorded ladder/tournament matches. I won 5 championships. I won the PvP Ladder pearls for so many weeks in a row that I had people e-mailing me, begging me, not to challenge them so they could have a shot at the pearls. We didn't just fight ladder/tournament fights though. We fought dozens of fights, daily, mainly in our training grounds, the Woods. Ark toll booths were famous. KAAOS was constantly in the sewers, the woods, the lost hills, the arena, and everywhere else serious PvP action was going on. As I said, if you never ran into any of us then you were obviously not much of a PvPer. If you never heard of Mech Roman, Mech Ryman, Victor Ark or Azmodion (all of my alts) then you were not a PvPer. If you never heard of or saw Ark then you were not a PvPer. If you never saw KAAOS then you were not a PvPer. If you were not on the PvP ladder or the WPC then you were not a PvPer. If you never participated in any other PvP tournament then you were not a PvPer. And even if you were on any of those ladders and never fought one of my alts that I listed between the years of '95 and '97 then you were nowhere near the top. <P>If you knew me at all you wouldn't throw out any comments regarding cloaks. I fought for a long fucking time without a cloak. I left post after post regarding what I thought about cloakers, how I felt 90% of all cloakers didn't know a fucking thing about PvP and that getting their cloak only made it worse because they would never get a chance to learn. If you knew me at all you wouldn't even think of spewing worthless shit about southwall. I made my living off of NPC manipulation. <P><i>"NWN was a situation that will never, ever, happen again in gaming. The game was around for a long time with a small player base and PVP was more of an art then anything we will ever see again. New players simply could not stand with the veterans without belonging to a group that could teach them the very essence of combat, leaving the veteran group to control the game. This is not possible in todays game enviroment and no one group will ever rule any game in such a manner in a vastly larger community."</i><P>I do agree with in part with this and I basically stated as much in my second post. Until such time (and that time may never come) that a game company makes a game with a good PvP system that is. There has never been, and may very well never be, another game that can compare to NWN's PvP. And mind you, I do not think NWN's system was perfect, there were a lot of things that could have been done to improve it, to make it even more tactical, to make it even more player skill based. The thing that has bothered me the most is developers did not learn from and improve on the concepts of NWN. Starting with UO, they totally went the oposite direction and have done nothing but bury RPG PvP deeper into a stinking pile of shit. <P>I do not agree with you however, for the most part, that new players could not stand with the veterans without belonging to a group that could teach about combat. The Arks certainly did not have the benefit of learning from veterans. The very fact that we didn't improved the overall quality of PvP as many of our tactics that we adopted over the years started to become commonplace. The core of Ark (prior to Ark) formed a newb guild, as newbs, and learned PvP through the school of hard knocks. Sure, it took a very long time, it took almost a year until we could even compete at the higher levels. Every fight we fought we fought with open eyes and open minds. Then we trained hour after hour, day after day against each other. Testing things we've seen, trying to improve on them. <P>My first post was to give Karst an understanding of what KAAOS was in NWN. My second post was to give him and understanding of how this same guild has adapted to the poor PvP environment we are in today. It was an attempt to elevate the basis of a narrow question "what if someone beats a KAAOSer in a fight" so that he may understand where KAAOS came from, how our mystique was created, and just why the base level of his question was so narrow and a base answer would have little merrit. Take what you want from the post but the bottom line is, KAAOS completely owned a game in a manner that may very well never be repeated. That is our legacy.  <P>Azmodion<BR>Lord of Misery<BR>KAAOS God of Misfortune
