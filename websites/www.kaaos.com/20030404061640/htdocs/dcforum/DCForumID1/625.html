         <blockquote>
         <font size="1" color="#FF0000">LAST EDITED ON 02-22-03 AT 05:09&nbsp;AM (PST)</font><p>Although such a thing would be a lot bigger than anything I have yet attempted, I am slowly beginning to see how it might fit together. The biggest hurdle remains the networking. I don't want to start yet in case I write something and then find it can't be networked. And then, I just unleashed one of my programs on my guild, and 2 out of the 7 who tried it couldn't get it to work...<P>Ideas should be OK though. Some of this stuff has been done before, but not all together.<BR>It should be quite possible to try out multiple ideas when the time comes, as most of the code would be the same for all of them.<BR>---<P>General ideas.<P>The idea is to get as much strategy in as possible, but without slowing things down too much. Chess is very strategic, but far too slow. Healing in a fight slows things down a lot. Also, there are several games where you have to heal every other turn to beat the boss monsters, (which are really much stonger than the player(s),) and this is boring. It should be possible to have a working system that does not include healing in battle.<P>Players would be able to heal themselves and each other, and possibly resurrect each other, when not in a combat situation. A battle would have to have a definite beginning and end, with definite people included. At the start of a battle, the game would have to switch from real-time to turn-based, and back again at the end. In a group situation, if someone leaves they should not be able to come back, otherwise they could get healed. If someone dies, it would be nice to let them stay and watch as long as they like, but to let them leave to get resurrected when they wish to.<P>Too much luck is sad. The effect of a spell should depend on multiple variables, including terrain factors and the players' relative stats. If enough variables are used it will provide the same variety that is normally produced by luck.<BR>---<P>These are 2 ideas for terrain.<P>1) Combat on the map (sort of).<P>Players have to be quite near to each other to start a battle. When one player PK attacks another, the system changes from real-time to turn-based. Each map square becomes one combat terrain square. Players only see others who are in the same battle. Fleeing would probably involve moving outside a certain distance from the enemy, or from the party leader in a group situation. The enemy would be able to follow if they saw the other person was trying to get away. Running is quite difficult, so if someone succeeds they should be protected from being attacked again for a short while.<P>Strategic possibilities from this idea: <BR>Choosing a good place to attack someone.<BR>Trying to edge towards a more suitable area of map during the fight.<BR>Running away, or chasing someone, could have some interest.<P>I don't know if this has been done before; it is certainly unusual.<P>2) Combat in a new scene.<P>Players go onto the same map square to fight. They then appear on a blown-up grid, with suitable terrain features for the area. The size of the combat area depends on the number of people involved. Fleeing could still involve distance, or relative speed changed by spells. This system does cause the problem of an artificial border round the area, which players cannot cross. Another possibility is wrapping at the edges, but that would be even wierder.<BR>---<P>Ideas on turns.<P>1) A true turn-based system.<P>Each player gets one turn each logic cycle. A turn includes some movement and some attacking/defending. If a strong spell is used, it reduces the distance that a player can move. A player can go without a spell, and so move further than usual.<P>An attack would need to take a turn after connecting to have its effect, in order to allow defending. This is a bit unrealistic, but it would be ok.<P>- Select and carry out the full set of actions for that turn :<P>The player who moved first would have a small advantage, but after that it would be fair, as it just keeps going, the same for everyone.  Turns are quite long and complicated.<P>If there were a lot of players, the game would move quite slowly for each one.<P>- 2 stages; players take it in turns to move, then round again for spells :<P>Turns are shorter and simpler, but the player who moved last each turn would have the advantage of seeing everything else that happened that turn before deciding what to do.<P>Still slow for large numbers of players.<P>- Everyone selects an action, then everyone moves :<P>The person who moved first each turn would have the advantage of seeing things when selecting an action as they would be when he moved.<BR>It could perhaps be set up so everyone moves at once, logically if not graphically.<BR>Two stages to each turn as above could help.<P>This would be faster because everyone would do their thinking at the same time.<P>2) Charge-based.<P>A player starts with no charge, and gains it slowly. Moving, or casting a spell, uses a certain amount of charge; the player queues an action and the game waits until they have enough. This could be affected by lag, but it could be set up slowly enough that there is time to think, and people with slow connections can play. A player gets some warning of incoming spells, and if they have planned carefully they can get enough charge to defend against it. This could be used in addition to mana.<P>There could be many strategic possibilites in charge-modifying spells. It would be advantageous for a player to save up longer and do a big spell, but if another player noticed this they could cast a spell to knock a large amount off the saved charge.<P>This system would mean that a player would move at the same rate no matter how many allies/enemies were there. This could be useful, but it could get confusing if everyone was moving at once.<P>I think this idea could be used to spice up a system without terrain, but if terrain is used it is probably unnecessary and unhelpful.<BR>---<P>Thoughts?

         <blockquote>
         While I am personally partial to turn-based PvP systems, this is not a very popular system in today’s market for several reasons. <P>As far as combat area, DSO tried to have turn-based combat integrated with a real-time (out of combat) game in having the combat screen the same screen as the regular game screen. It was a miserable experience as far as I was concerned. Someone mentioned an improvement to that idea by having a definable radius so others didn’t “stumble” into the turn-based area by accident. In theory this sounds good but the simple fact is this wouldn’t be practical due to real-estate limitations.<P>The gold box series idea of having a separate real-time combat screen worked rather well as far as I’m concerned. This is similar to what you are talking about. However, your idea is to have the combat area being a certain distance from a particular PC. I’m not so sure I like this idea though it would depend on the other factors involved within the combat area (NPC interaction, terrain, etc.). In a game like NWN where NPC’s played a role in PvP combat, people would need to jockey for position. In this case, it would be a bad idea to have the combat area based on the position of a particular PC. In this case a definable area would serve better.<P>The one great thing about having a definable combat area is closure. PvP is not simply about killing your opponent, it’s about competition and winning or losing said competition. If someone flees they lost, it means the same as them dying. So who gives a shit if they can flee or not?<P>As far as luck, a certain amount of luck is a good thing. It keeps things interesting. That being said, too many variables and luck having too much influence is a bad for competition. Speaking of variables, variables can be a real problem for balance and competition. Too many variables means less tactical and more luck. What you chose to bring to the plate can weigh the outcome. While this may be fun for some, I prefer that in fight actions do the talking. I like an even or similar set of “facts” for both players. Their in-fight tactical decisions deciding the outcome. Add in “some” luck and it’s their tactical decisions in the face of that luck factor which makes a PvP encounter interesting to me.  <P>I do not like variables such as stats that swing widely in range from extremes. I do not like “gear” that has profound effect on PvP. Stats and gear should be tempered so that there is a small variable which can “enhance” PvP but not weight it too heavily. <P>On speed of combat and healing....Chess is far too slow for whom? Do you think a chess match would last very long if you were playing against a grand master? I personally don’t like PvP that lasts 10 seconds. There are far too many 1 - 2 shot PvP games out there. It’s pathetic. <P>As for healing, healing is fine if implemented properly. Healing is a counter spell. PvP should have counters. However, healing is a bad counter when it is the only counter and when it’s not balanced properly (UO for example).<P>The biggest problem with turn-based games these days is number of players. If you have too many people in one fight it takes too long to get to your turn, there is too much down time. How many is too many? Well, you need to have a few seconds to actually manipulate the keyboard/mouse/hot keys or what have you (to make your move). 5 seconds is not long enough especially if it must be sustained. You’ll miss some moves from time to time, 5 seconds would be too frustrating. You must also consider the CPU carrying out the turns. If it flies through the effects of a turn too fast people won’t be able to see WTF just happened. You’ll need to add another 5 - 10 seconds to every person’s turn for the computer to carry out the turns. <P>So let’s say we went with a sliding timer based on the number of people in a fight. 2 people = 20 seconds to do your turn plus 5 - 10 seconds for the computer to display the results (let’s call it 5 for argument sake). Each turn would take 50 seconds in this case. Let’s say you only get 15 seconds for your turn when there are 4 or more people. In this case, 3 people = 75 seconds per turn and 4 people = 80 seconds. Let’s say it adjusts down to 10 seconds when there are 8 or more people, I don’t think you could reasonably have less than a 10 second timer. In this case, 7 people = 140 seconds and 8 people = 120 seconds. You are at 2 minutes  per turn once you hit 6  people. What if you had 20 people. 20 people = 300 seconds per turn. 5 minutes per turn, that’s a long god damn time. Too long as far as I’m concerned. But as you can see, any more than this is getting way out of hand. <P>So say you push 20 people at 5 minutes a turn. That’s 10 v 10. In this day and age, that’s not enough of an option in one fight. Many guilds are hundreds strong. For my tastes, 10 people in a fight is fine, 20 people in a fight is more than enough but for many people, they will not enjoy this limitation.<P>Lastly, you mentioned different types of turns:<P>You mentioned logical cycle, I like this option best. <P>You mentioned multi-cycle turns (everyone moves, then everyone attacks), I don’t see how this would decrease the total time per round. It does sound interesting though. However, it would have it’s  ’s and -‘s, in lieu of a single cycle turn, from a tactical standpoint. I think it’s a viable option though if implemented correctly. But again, I don’t see how this would decrease the total time per round. <P>You mentioned all turns carried out at the same time. In the logical cycle with a 20 second timer, in essence, you get 40 seconds to “think” about your turn in a 1 on 1. In a 6 on 6 (with a reduced timer) you would get 120 seconds to “think” about your turn. If everyone gets 20 seconds, at the same time, and then all the turns are carried out it would speed up the game obviously. However, you would loose the tactical “flow” of the game. Here again, just as in real-time PvP, you are sacrificing good PvP for faster PvP. So what’s the answer? What are we willing to give up? Well, personally, if you gave me this option or a “real-time” game that has combat “slowed down” a bit I think I would prefer the real-time game. The same time, turn-based, “could” be slightly more tactical in that there are actual visible turns that spell effects can be timed off of but that’s about the only benefit. There are several drawbacks to this system. It doesn’t flow, people move out of position so that selected actions are in fact invalid, you don’t get to see what’s coming thus nurfing counter-tactics. While real-time games suffer from timers being actual time (thus nurfing the tactical value of effect durations) at least you could see the action playing out, you could have casting emotes happening so you could choose proper counters, etc. All in all, I think this is a weak idea. It takes the bad of turn-based and molds it with the bad of real-time. It is a child that received only the bad qualities from its’ parents. <P>I don’t have any real thoughts on your charged base system. This system is basically a real-time system but one where your resource is your “charge”. You consume your resource based on the types of actions you take. Developers can’t even get basic real-time right yet, they can’t figure out how to properly implement and balance resource expenditure. This is why there are no good real time RPG PvP games to date. What I’m saying, basically, is that this “idea” is putting the cart ahead of the horse. <P>Azmodion<BR>KAAOS

         Clarifications:<P>- What I meant with the combat on the map idea was to have each combat group isolated from the rest of the world, though in the same geographical location and possibly visible in some way. People not involved in a battle would probably see those who were involved, perhaps semi-transparent and without any spell graphics. There may or may not be a way of joining in, but if there is, it is a deliberate action, not simply stepping on to that area of ground. People involved in a battle would probably not see anyone outside, as that would distract them.<P>- What I meant by variables was mostly in-battle variables. Each player would start with a similar set of stats and equipment. Stat modifying spells could be used. Terrain factors would also have an important effect on spells.<BR>---<P>I agree now that a definable area is probably better for PvP. Leaving this area would mean running away. This is perhaps one thing where PvM combat could be different. Hunting down a monster or running from one in an involved way could add interest, as monsters are inherantly stupid.<P>Most people don't see running away as the same thing as dying. Even in games where you lose very little by dying, and gain very little by killing someone, people still run away, and the other player is usually annoyed when they do so.<P>On the speed of chess, two new players can take 20 minutes to play a game. Two good players can take an hour. Two grand masters can take hours or days. I would say that that's too slow for a decent RPG.<BR>I agree that 10 seconds is too short though. Perhaps 5 minutes or so would be appropriate.<P>On speed and luck, the game of CyberWars is an interesting one. It is heavily luck-based, but there are clearly good players and bad players. (At the moment, I am a bad player, though there are many other Sabres who are extremely good at it...) Turns are usually 30 seconds or 1 minute, and up to 6 people can play at once. Battles last about 5 to 10 minutes. This is a game that uses two-cycle turns, to good effect.<BR>---<P>Multi-cycle turns wouldn't decrease the total time per round, but each sub-cycle would be shorter, so a player wouldn't have to wait as long to be able to do something. But this idea still doesn't flow as well as the first one.<P>The problem of actions becoming invalid in the system where everyone moves at once could be helped by multi-cycle turns. If everyone selects where to move to, then everyone moves, there has been no interaction yet. The next sub-cycle, everyone does their spells. But this is still not a very good system.<P>A charge-based system without terrain is a possibility for PvM in certain circumstances. In puzzle dungeons, a terrain based system might not work very well. It is probably useful not to allow PvP in these places. There could be dedicated PvP caves with features useful for the purpose.<BR>---<P>The first turns system looks like the most useful, but there is still the question of defending. I have a few ideas, but have never actually seen anything like this before.<P>One idea would be to have defensive spells go off immediately, but for offensive spells to wait until the start of the next turn.<BR>When a player selects a spell, they glow, and it says that they are preparing to cast that spell on a particular target. The target player sees that, and casts the counter spell. The first player's spell is fired off at the beginning of their turn (before any movement), hits the second, and interacts with the counter. Then the first player moves and selects another spell.<BR>There is a question of what happens if the second player instead charges up for a similar offensive spell. They will be hit during charging. In the context of reality, this would probably break their spell attempt. In the game, similarly, this choice could be a silly thing to do, but tactically, striking back does need to be a viable option. Perhaps the spell could just do the full damage, and then allow the second player to do their spell the next turn.<P>I think some movement should be allowed as a tactical defense against an incoming spell. Perhaps moving behind a bush wouldn't stop the spell completely, but would just reduce its effect, depending on the spell. Moving behind another player could be interesting. Some spells could home in on a particular player, and hit whatever they move behind, while other spells could be aimed at a particular place, and have a blast radius. Players would choose a spell and aim it so as to give their opponent as little scope as possible for moving out of the way.<BR>---<P>Perhaps it would be useful for me to build a small prototype, with a few different terrain tiles, a few spells, and some brainless monsters to kill. It may not be networkable, but it would be good training, and may help to make some ideas more solid.

         <blockquote>
         The flow of combat is extremely important, too slow (like chess) is boring for almost any modern day gamer. I suck at chess, but I'm sure that even I could push a grand master to 20 moves if I played it defensively enough. I'm with you when you say that healing slows the combat down too much. I don't mind seeing a heal or two in combat (especially group combat), but damaging for 100 hp, then healing for 200 hp is a problem. Heals should be used as a counter against someone who is trying to chip away at your HP. There is no way that heals should be a reasonable counter to someone who's going full out damage.<P>However, combat that is over in less than 5 moves is sucky as well. Strategic combat will take at least 10 moves. A good combat system can let one player win against a crappy player in 6-10 moves, but that should be the bottom. I don't neccessarily see any upper cap on the number of moves it takes to win. Some epic battle between the two best players might take over 100 moves to win. Assuming that every move was an important one, 100 moves to win would be a great combat system.<P>Luck sucks. Period. If you had no luck involved, I'd be happy. If you had just a small amount of luck, I'd be happy. When the entire game comes down to lucky rolls, I won't be happy. Use small ranges of numbers when determining to-hit and damage. That keeps things a little bit interesting and forces people to adjust to that unlucky roll.<P>__________________________________________________<P>1) Combat on the Map<P>This was a pretty big problem in DSO. Granted, it never had definable boundaries, which really sucked. However, even with a definable boundary, it will still suck rather badly.<P>2) Combat in a new Scene<P>NWN used this to good effect. NWN was a realtime game when it came to movement. However, NWN movement was done in what could be called a maze with defined squares. Each square had its own new scene that would pop up if combat was started on it. It becomes a lot different when you have a more open game without defined squares, which is pretty much required of games these days. I don't believe this would work very well.<P>3) Declared Combat<P>This is one of my old ideas. Basically, to start combat you declare combat on an opponent (usually done by starting an offensive attack on him). Combat is done on the map like normal, except in turn-based. The only way that other people get sucked in is if either they declare combat on someone in the combat or if someone in the combat declares combat on them. <P>__________________________________________________<P>1) True turn based<P>Everyone knows this. It has a couple drawbacks. It usually gives a slightly unfair advantage to whoever goes first because whoever goes 2nd will have to adjust to whatever was done before he even had a chance to do anything. The other drawback is time. True turn based is just painfully slow and it really needs to be.<P>2) Split turns between movement and action<P>This was done in the Warhammer series. It made things a little bit more fair. You want to move 2nd and attack first, but you can't do both. When you move 2nd, you can put yourself in the appropriate spot to smack your opponent or not let him smack you. Attacking 1st is an obvious advantage because you can potentially kill before they can attack back. It takes away the advantage of going first, however it slows down combat even more than normal turn based because there's a small downtime when transfering turns and there will be more turns with the movement turn followed by the attack turn.<P>3) Everyone takes a turn at the same time<P>Don't bother. Azmo is right on that one.<P>4) Charge based<P>I can see this working. Spend a point to move, or spend 5 to toss a fireball. Spend 2 points to swing your sword or 5 points to try knocking your opponents head off. It could work, but it would likely be turned aside by the masses just like every other turn-based system would.<P>5) Real time<P>Real-time combat CAN BE STRATEGIC. I believe it is also the only combat system that would be accepted by any reasonable quantity of players. In order to make it strategic, you need to really slow it down, slower than reality. That can also be a problem. Real life fighting is not really very strategic, it is mostly won by whoever is bigger, faster, and stronger. When you apply that to a video game where everyone is just as big, fast, and strong it is pretty pointless. Sure, some games can be fun in real-time, but twitch based combat isn't an option in a MMORPG. That means you would have to take a 'real-time' game and slow it down to slower than real-time in order to make it strategic. Will the masses accept that? I just don't know. If not, the masses will likely never find strategic combat again.<P>Mortarion<BR>god of death and decay

         The masses don't want strategic combat. That's why it's so hard to find a good PvP game these days. That's why I'm going to be different and say I don't care about the masses. In the end, my programming is to please me. If, eventually, it also satisfies maybe a few hundred discerning individuals in the whole world, that's great. Trying to please everyone is a tactic that has been tried too many times. The choice is between good PvP and popular PvP, and I'm going for good PvP.<P>Anyway, however the system ends up, a player will only end up in a combat situation if they attack someone or if another player attacks them. That's what I was getting at from the beginning. This applies whether the combat is on the map or in a new scene.<P>It seems that more than one idea could work. I may decide to try out several of them when the time comes.

         <blockquote>
         <i>The flow of combat is extremely important, too slow (like chess) is boring for almost any modern day gamer. I suck at chess, but I'm sure that even I could push a grand master to 20 moves if I played it defensively enough.</i><P>A game is boring if the game is boring, not how long a fight takes. Most modern day RPG's take mere seconds to complete a fight, all modern day RPG's are boring to me. Speed does not = good PvP. <P>I had no problem with the pace of NWN PvP but compared to today's games, a PvP match in NWN took an eternity. NWN, for example, took anywhere from a couple minutes to a few hours to complete a fight. When I fought most any non&#8209;tournament fighter in NWN I'd have them dead in 11 rounds or less. Usually less but 11 rounds was about as long as most un-notable PvPers could last against me. That's 7 minutes max putting the average at abound 3 &#8209; 5 minutes. To me this was very quick, plenty quick. It gave enough time for everyone to get their hands dirty and do some thinking. Alternatively, most matches against notable PvPers would last 30  minutes. I've had several that lasted an hour  and one (against Kal) that lasted two and a half hours. You’d think 4 on 4's would take even longer but this wasn’t really the case. Our quad team only ever had 1 match go as far as 18 rounds (which took around 30 - 45 minutes or so). The next longest match we had took 11 rounds (around 20 minutes). Is all of that too long for today’s gamers? Probably but who cares, today’s gamers have no idea what PvP is anyway. This pretty much coincides with your second paragraph but I wanted to elaborate on my GM chess comment. I don’t really have a time frame preference, I just think that combat should get a chance to flesh out. <P><i> I'm with you when you say that healing slows the combat down too much. I don't mind seeing a heal or two in combat (especially group combat), but damaging for 100 hp, then healing for 200 hp is a problem. Heals should be used as a counter against someone who is trying to chip away at your HP. There is no way that heals should be a reasonable counter to someone who's going full out damage.</i> <P>Healing only “slows combat down too much” when it is not balanced properly. Healing is a counter tactic but as I said, it’s not a good counter tactic (poor game design) if it is the ONLY counter tactic or if it’s not balanced properly. PvP is very much about resources. When those resources are not balanced properly you end up with a piss poor PvP design. Health needs to be in line with damage output/resource expenditure. Games that are designed for a certain class to have 1000 health while another class has in excess of 3 or 4k, for example, are simply working off a recipe for failure. It’s not the numbers, hell you could have 500000000 health, it’s the spread. Shadowbane, for example, has too great of a spread on just about everything from health to stats to armor rating to attack rating. It’s damn near impossible, which SB has basically proven, to balance too great of a spread. Additionally, casting and melee systems need to be put on the same page as far as resources. Damage, whatever be the source, needs to have similar costs. Any counters need to take into consideration this cost. This is why healing is so fucked up in most games, nobody balances the cost. In NWN, for example, healing was precisely in line with damage. You had a cost (it took up a spell slot, you want to heal you have to give up a spell slot which means you can produce less damage). A heal spell of a particular level was exactly in line with the damage counter part of that level. If you mem’d all heal spells you would not have enough damage output to finish someone. There were items in NWN that had healing charges and they gimped the fuck out of PvP which is why they weren’t allowed in tournament PvP. They fucked up the resource balance.<P><i>Luck sucks. Period. If you had no luck involved, I'd be happy. If you had just a small amount of luck, I'd be happy. When the entire game comes down to lucky rolls, I won't be happy. Use small ranges of numbers when determining to&#8209;hit and damage. That keeps things a little bit interesting and forces people to adjust to that unlucky roll.</i><P>I agree with you that too much luck is gay but some luck makes things interesting. In NWN I used to bitch and moan about luck. If luck wasn’t involved I felt I’d never lose to anyone. This may or may not have been true, I’m not here to argue that, but the fact is, once I hit my prime I lost around 10% of all my fights in NWN and I would have attributed at least 9% of that to luck. In the hundreds of fights I had I can count on 1 hand the number of fights I had where I was just flat out out-classed in that particular fight. One day, during one of my tirades about “luck” Hedron told me “if there was no luck, and you never lost, you would be bored off your ass, this way there is always a chance you could lose”. You know what? He was right. Many of the tactics I used were to mitigate the luck factor. I would avoid fighting in locations that would turn out to be a slugfest because they put the most strain on your saves. I used Mirror Image more than most and I had several “fake” tactics just so I could keep my images up. I faked like a mother fucker. I did whatever I had to do to keep my images up, hell I was known to dispel my own globe if I felt the pressure of no image. Nobody dispelled themselves. Fuck, I even faked dispelling myself from time to time which could only be pulled off because certain people knew I was about the only crazy fuck around that would actually do it for real. All that shit was to keep people from casting certain spells or doing certain actions that would put me at greater risk of lady luck fucking me up the ass with a strap on. The presence of luck not only made the fights have more flavor because of the risk of losing but also it added to the strategic and tactical depth of combat. <P>Basically a little luck can be a good thing when all else is equal. But NWN had a very tight scope of variables (as far as gear/stats/etc), when you have stats and gear that vary widely in scope and play a big role in combat effectiveness you’ve already got a piece of shit PvP system. Talking about luck is a waste of time, that’s the least of your concerns. <P> <BR><i>Combat in a new Scene <P>NWN used this to good effect. NWN was a realtime game when it came to movement. However, NWN movement was done in what could be called a maze with defined squares. Each square had its own new scene that would pop up if combat was started on it. It becomes a lot different when you have a more open game without defined squares, which is pretty much required of games these days. I don't believe this would work very well.</i> <P>NWN didn’t really have a new scene that would pop up, as in it wasn’t a different map on each square. NWN combat scene was basically a blow up of the out-of-combat map.Yes, there were certain nuances to certain locations that would be different than a location a few squares away but basically the idea was it was a blow up of the area you were in, in an overhead view rather than first person. Something similar to this could be integrated. However, defining a turn-based fight in a real-time area be a little difficult. Though I think it can be done with something similar to what “The Realm” uses (or used to use, haven’t seen that game since like ‘96 or some shit). The Realm had a gay ass cloud in an area which symbolized a fight. I’m not saying there would be a cloud with arms and legs flying out or some gay shit but there could be a beacon. Perhaps others’ passing by could pull up a display which listed the people in the fight and perhaps gave options to join the fight or to watch the fight. As far as re-enterers, the fight beacon would stay until the fight is over, ending a fight would require certain parameters. As long as the beacon of a fight is there it keeps a list of people who were in the fight at some point, they could not re-enter that beacon. I’m obviously making this shit up as I go here so I hadn’t worked out any details for a particular system like this. <P><BR><i>Declared Combat <P>This is one of my old ideas. Basically, to start combat you declare combat on an opponent (usually done by starting an offensive attack on him). Combat is done on the map like normal, except in turn&#8209;based. The only way that other people get sucked in is if either they declare combat on someone in the combat or if someone in the combat declares combat on them.</i> <P>Hmm, I’d have to see it in action but it sounds like it would be a little strange having real-time people standing next to turn-based people. I could see some potential problems (especially with AE’s, healing, positioning, movement, and a few other things). But hell, I’m not opposed to anything, until I see it in action. I do know that a separate screen can solve many problems with integration of real-time (out of combat) and turn-based combat. <P><i>True turn based <P>It usually gives a slightly unfair advantage to whoever goes first because whoever goes 2nd will have to adjust to whatever was done before he even had a chance to do anything.</i><P>I don’t agree that this is an inherent problem with turn-based. Initiative is a serious problem in real-time (most real-time games, whoever initiates has a fucking huge advantage) but not so much so in turn-based. In NWN, for example, because of the presence of NPC’s, going first was not always an advantage. In some spots it was a down right disadvantage.<P><i>Don't bother. Azmo is right on that one.</i> <P>Azmo is right on every one, Azmo is always right ;p<P>Azmodion<BR>KAAOS

         The idea about fight beacons, spectators and re-entering sounds good.<P>It would be strange to have real-time people standing next to turn-based people. And it could cause problems of the real-time person choosing a good position in relation to the turn-based ones before joining the fight. But there will be ways round this. I still quite like this idea.<P>Geo, your perfectly reasonable post was spoiled somewhat by the "So sorry haha" at the end.<BR>Anyway, if someone dies in a game, the usual system is to send them back to a particular place and revive them automatically. However, I have seen a system where the dead player turns into a shadow. They can move about to some extent, watch fights, and talk to other players. They have to walk back to a particular point to get resurrected. It works fine, and realism doesn't really matter.

         I still don't understand why in the world would someone have special places where you can rez your sorry ass. Like Ultima it would be a place where a few guys camp out to rez kill.<P> This would further agitate the player that wants to get back in the game. A mage had no trouble with this, they would hurry to the bank and recall to his house. All that would be needed are regs and a hourse along with traped pouches and maybe some magic cloths and potions. A fighter would have to equip a weapon and bandages and then run to another store to get the damn horse. All along hoping he would not get killed in the process.<P>In Neocron they have less penalties. You can keep you weapon, buy back your armor and other junk, and be replicated to any gene replication area after death. The only down side is the belt which can be hacked but most people dont have the skill. That is the only object you have to go back for. In Ultima you rarely got your junk back since most people could loot in a split second.<P>In checkers you can exchange a piece for a king. In chess you can get your weapon back if you cross the board with a pawn. Ultima Online would not consider changing the rule with being able to keep a weapon when being killed unless you spend a hell of a long time getting a bless item for it. If a 5 time gm got that then a 7 time gm would be useless.

Even though there was a safe area round it, the PKers surrounded this safe area and tried to kill anyone who stepped outside it.<P>Perhaps it would be useful to prevent players attacking someone again after they have killed them.<P>But however it's done, the idea is to have more PvP and less PK. Large amounts of loot encourage PK, as does unbalanced combat. There could be a duelling option, where a player could challenge another with certain settings, and the two could bet items on it if they wanted to.

         <blockquote>
         A balanced pvp would be either the same type of class or a 2 on 2 that would be fair in most games. Every game that is created has a more powerful type of class than another. In Neocron the most powerful are the psi monks or mage just like any other RPG out there. Then the second are the warriors or tanks with the best armor. This would be another goal to have accomplished to make a game fair. There are attempts to have a player with a little of each attribute but these kinds of players fall short at the end with patches taking away the best qualities with the idea. They are afraid of making a player godly. <P>I think the best kind of class would combine the best attributes such as power with spells and having health and some dexterity. Why not have no restrictions on what a character can and can’t have like SWG will created? This way it is all about where you place your skills and not having any limits on how much spells, dexterity, strength, or constitution you want for your base.
