         <blockquote>
         While alot of what you're saying is intelligent questioning of the unknown, and worth thinking about, you're pushing it too hard.  I've thought about and/or asked some of those same questions myself.  But there are a few of reasons it's not getting under my skin as much as it is for you.  Some of these things have been touched on in your exchange with J already and some haven't, but I thought I'd spotlight them a little.<P>Most of this all fits into the category, "you're skinning the wrong cat."<P>1) It's definitely a smart thing to wonder about the skill set of any start-up company in terms of what amount of acumen and business experience they have.  It's this analysis that allows us to decide how much faith we will put in their ability to produce results.  HOWEVER, why the fuck you'd be pissy about WP on this issue is beyond me.  They have proven to the people they needed to prove things to that they have what it takes.  Namely the investors.<P>Have they launched a PR campaign to inform the game fans of their experience base?  No.  Not really.  But if I were them I wouldn't waste any time on that either.  Why the fuck should I?  The fans for the most part love my game concept, the money men already committed, etc. etc.  Any time spent trying to educate the public to achieve goals that have already been achieved is a waste of bandwidth.  In the meantime, they did provide some of this info via interviews and such.  That's plenty.  Would YOU spend time on it if you rant that business Faust?  If you did, I'd question your judgement.<P>2)  On the game mechanics information there are two major blind spots - big fat ones - in what we know about the game.<P>a) Broad conceptual outlines of how they will deal with the various community, mechanical and social challenges of PIGs.  They have repeatedly indicated that they don't want to share these due to the competitive landscape.  You may agree or disagree with that stand, you may think it smells fishy, but it is what it is.  It's not a WHOLLY unreasonable point of view, and I don't really blame them for it.<P>b) Very specific mechanical information that would indicate how that actual game will come together and what the smart moves will be.  I personally consider any attempt to convey this information to be pissing in the wind.  You can't provide some fat list of tables and values and expect most people to assemble that into any real notion of how playability will be.  And on top of that to release those things when they'll only change drastically seems like a treadmill type of task that will have to be done over and over again as they're tweaked until not even the statisticians care.<P>I fully agree that the above two blind spots are the only thing a smart gamer gives a fuck about at this point.  But I also am fairly comfortable with WHY they're blind spots.<P>3) Yes, the recent releases of what cool books to read are not helpful in evaluating the game.  Who gives a fuck?  It's not like they're mounting an advertising effort on it.  The bottom line is that SB has created a fairly friendly atmosphere with their fan sites, and often they just shoot the shit with them.<P>If you combine this with a lack of hard news... you get news updates just like that one.  Who cares?  It's background noise.  It's kind of unimpressive on the front page of the news site, but I wouldn't be annoyed at WP for making the comments, I'd be annoyed with the news sites for treating it like news.  And even then, WHO CARES?  If it' that or a blank page, what's the difference?<P>4)  On the release of the RP background story.  Nope, I haven't read it.  Nope, I really don't care much about it one way or the other UNTIL it starts to become relevant through the game.  But lots of people live for that stuff, and they're catering to that part of the audience.  Once again, who fucking cares if they release it?<P>The bottom line is that<P>A) You're pissed at WP for not releasing more hard info.  But I personally just don't find that lack of info to be unexpected or unreasonable.<P>B) You're pissed at WP for releasing "fluff".  But I don't have a problem with them releasing fluff as long as it doesn't impede development.  AND, I think on blind spot (a) they're making a strategic decision and on blind spot (b) they'd be pissing up a rope to try it.<P>REALLY what I think you're pissed at is the rabid fans for being rabid rather than being reasonably optimistic and interested but intellectually independent.  But did you really expect people to be otherwise?  Welcome to the bell curve.<P>Other than that, I think you just like being pissy and you enjoy the drama of strong position statements.  It sells better in the consulting biz, doesn't it now?  (smile)<P>HOWEVER, I nonetheless find your frothing rants to be hilarious and to bring into relief some issues that while WP probably shouldn't/won't do much to resolve them, perhaps a rabid fan would do well to think about.<P>Hedron<BR><a href="http://www.kaaos.com/hedron/falseprophet.htm" target="_blank">The False Prophet</a><BR><a href="http://www.kaaos.com" target="_blank">KAAOS</a><P>...No child, don't cry.
