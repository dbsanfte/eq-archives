<P>
“NOOO!!!!! YOU CAN’T!!!!!!!!!!!”
</p>
<P>
“YOU CAN’T!!!!YOU CAN’T!!!!!!!!!YOU CAAAAAAAAAAAAAAN’T!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!”

SNAP

<P>
hush....................... quiet....
</p>
<P>
“...mmm...mmmercy lord,” mushed the bloody gash of its mouth.
</p>
<P>
A sickening crunch.
</p>
<P>
FORCE and DEATH - BURNING and DESTRUCTION - EVIL and FURY
</p>
<P>
....betrayal....
</p>
<P>
THESE THINGS SCREAM OUT AT YOU.
</p>
<P>
These things pour from the veins of the dying. The human force - fired and tempered, boiled and extracted, concentrated and eviscerated
from the body like the guts being pulled from cattle for the slaughter. Long messy strings of the essence of life yanked out fistful by
fistful, dripping with the blood and slop of the creature giving up its spark.
</p>
<P>
These are the things that punch through human existence, and make their indelible scar on the skin of each damned mortal soul. These are
the things that stand above every other human experience.
</p>
<P>
When a mortal slumbers, these things... THEY are what is felt in the deep night of sleep.
</p>
<P>
Sleep, that mimicry of death. Even death is pierced by suffering.
</p>
<P>
These things.... these things.... they matter.
</p>
<P>
And this is a fact. A fact that The False Prophet had come to know. But it had not been easy to learn.
</p>
<P>
<hr size=7 width=75%>
<BR>
Fire from a thousand pits. That was all his eyes saw. Fire from a thousand pits, burning on the fuels of rage and loss and pain and grief.
The smoke that curled into the air was greasy and black with the despair of those who roasted in the fires below.
</p>
<P>
This was the world.
</p>
<P>
This was the wreckage of the world.
</p>
<P>
His nostrils flared as he drew in the smell of destruction, and the sky was red to him, and his soul was dark to him.
</p>
<P>
Yaas....
</p>
<P>
Hedron stood in the crushed ruin of a temple, outlined in shadow and firelight against the night. His body was taut with a power that he
had held contained for centuries. His hands gripped and ungripped in a wrestles kind of ritual, and he turned toward the boy.
</p>
<P>
The boy, for his part, looked up at Hedron with confused, but confident eyes. After all that had happened, this boy still trusted Hedron,
still trusted The Prophet. And this boy was the very last.
</p>
<P>
But the child knew he was safe. It was this immortal being, The Prophet, who had built, guided and ruled the land for longer than any
living memory or written record stretched back. The Prophet had ruled since eons before this boy had come from the ether of pre-birth.
He had ruled for so long that the trust of the people was like a religion. The people believed in him. Had believed in him. Unquestionably.
</p>
<P>
But their lord had been quiet for centuries, and when he reappeared to the people, he was almost... almost a legend. Old men and women
had long dead grandparents who had last seen The Prophet in flesh, and they told tales of him to their grandchildren. Grandchildren who
were now grandparents themselves, and were the last to know direct reports of the glorious Prophet. When he reappeared the people
revered him as they had before, feeling at last that a piece they had been missing had come back into place.
</p>
<P>
It wasn’t until after they were dead that their severed souls began to question what had happened.
</p>
<P>
And now here was the last of the people. A child before his... his God. There was no other way to put it.
</p>
<P>
Hedron crouched down low, and faced the boy. “Child,” he whispered, “do you know why men build?”
</p>
<P>
The child shook his head.
</p>
<P>
“Child, men build because they know they are mortal. They seek to make something greater than themselves. Something great enough to
carry their essence, some part of themselves, down through the ages.” The child watched, and listened, but he did not understand.
</p>
<P>
“And so men build, child. And I have seen the results of their work. Do you know what that result is? It is nothing. Statues, monuments,
temples, ideas, religions, art, literature, laws, governments. All of it becomes dust eventually. Oh, something new is always built, but
nothing nothing nothing lasts. Did you know that child?” The child shook his head no. He had not known that, but now that his Prophet
had told him, now he knew it.
</p>
<P>
Hedron smiled, somehow cruelly, and said “But there is one thing that lasts. I last. I have endured. Throughout time I have existed, and all
things inside me have existed, and all things without me crumble.”
</p>
<P>
Hedron reached out one hand and took the arm of the child and led him deeper into the heart of the temple they were in. “This is the center
of the Land. This temple is where the heart and soul of the entire People rests. Come with me and I will show it to you.”
</p>
<P>
They walked together, the image of a father and his son. Stone columns that had collapsed made grinding noises as they parted before the
two and debris cleared itself away. The two of them eventually reached the nexus of the temple, and gazed at a brightly throbbing Cross,
its white light bathing them.
</p>
<P>
The light rested on the child like the hand of a mother, and it glared off of Hedron The Prophet like his touch revolted it. Hedron reached
out a gray gloved hand, and tore the cross from the deep rich earth it was rooted in, and hefted it like a mace. The white light grayed and
dimmed at his touch, and the cross almost seemed to... to whimper.
</p>
<P>
“Child, do you know what the People have made that will last forever? They have made the memory of their suffering and death root itself
in my mind. And I, and my memory, will live forever. Do you understand that in dying, the People have finally achieved the immortality
that all their building could never grant them?”
</p>
<P>
The child, for the first time, waned in his worship of The Prophet, and his eyes cleared. He looked at Hedron, really looked at Hedron. He
looked at the set of his mouth, the piercing of his eyes.
</p>
<P>
The silence was unbearable and unbreakable in the way that the weight of a deep cavern collapsing on a man might be unbearable and
unbreakable. No matter how desperate the need to do away with it, it would not break.
</p>
<P>
But break it did. And it broke with tears. They streamed down the child’s face.
</p>
<P>
Hedron had what he wanted. “Yes, Child. I have chosen you, the last of the People, to know it. To know more than the agony of torture,
and the despair of death that I gave to the others. I have chosen you to know betrayal. I have betrayed you.”
</p>
<P>
The child’s face flowed with tears, and a small sob broke his clenched jaw open.
</p>
<P>
Hedron whispered... “No child. Don’t cry. Your tears only boil away on the Twisted Cross. It’s your blood that soaks in deep.... your
blood.”
</p>
<P>
Hedron reached under the chin of the boy, and tightened his grip.
</p>
<P>
“NOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!”
</p>
<P>
“NOOO!!!!! YOU CAN’T!!!!!!!!!!!”
</p>
<P>
“YOU CAN’T!!!!YOU CAN’T!!!!!!!!!YOU CAAAAAAAAAAAAAAN’T!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!”
</p>
<P>
SNAP
</p>
<P>
hush....................... quiet....
</p>
<P>
“...mmm...mmmercy lord,” mushed the bloody gash of its mouth.
</p>
<P>
A sickening crunch.
</p>
<P>
A crunch as the cross that had been pulled from the ground and pulled from the heart of the Land by Hedron smashed into the head of the
boy, the last of the People. As it struck, the white light died, and the arms of the cross were twisted horribly by the impact with the skull.
</p>
<P>
The Twisted Cross was born as Hedron absorbed from the child all that was the People and the Land. And he whispered again from
between ragged breaths...
</p>
<P>
“I am Hedron. The Prophet is no more. I am The False Prophet.” His shuddering, convulsing body crashed to the ground, and the Twisted
Cross melted itself into his soul, making itself and its sins his companion forever.
</p>
<P>
Later, much later, he rose, and moved on toward other worlds. The Twisted Cross swung at his side, and the cruel power of the
destruction of a world hid in his body.
