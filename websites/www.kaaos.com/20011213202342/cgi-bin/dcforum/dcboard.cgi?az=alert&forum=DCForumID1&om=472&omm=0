Many SB fans are wondering when Shadowbane will start its Closed Beta, so I'll leave a more formal announcement for another time.

While a lot of our development effort has gone according to plans, there have been a few problems that are taking longer than anticipated.
In a project this large and complex, that shouldn't be too surprising. Obviously, it's in Ubi Soft's best interest to get Shadowbane into beta as soon as possible. That being said, remember that beta programs are conducted for very tangible, professional reasons. In this case, we need outside testers in the world so we can stress the infrastructure and tune the game systems. If we aren't ready to conduct those tests properly, it would be a waste of your time and ours to start a beta phase. 

Our network infrastructure is all in place and intense testing is taking place as we speak... The *moment* the last big show-stoppers are fixed, we'll start Beta. The NDA's are ready to go, the envelopes are all addressed, the CDs are waiting to be burned, Wolfpack is eager to see some real players in their world, and the servers are awaiting the first of you to log on.

You all know the wrath other MMOs have faced due to problematic launches, and we're determined to make the unveiling of closed beta as smooth as possible. We're just as eager to get into the world and play as you are, but we will not compromise our commitment to quality in order to grab some quick PR. 

In the future, we will strive to keep you better informed of our schedule and all the latest news.

Wow, it may actually be time to bring the kaaos wolves home from the various worlds in which they are currently feasting...And I don't want to hear shit about my positive outlook on this one.  This is right from the horse's mouth (again).  ;-)
