                                  Faust was always a ego maniac who did not cried 
                                  and spouted off when he didnt get his way. Ya 
                                  wanna know his idea of how this bond should 
                                  deal with Arc's aspirations to lead the bond...here 
                                  it was...&quot;boot him make a web page defaming 
                                  him&quot;.Gee, thats class. &gt; &gt;<BR>
                                  <BR>
                                  Of course, this was within days Faust told me 
                                  that if folks didnt see Smoke as a good leader 
                                  anymore that he would step in and take over 
                                  Smoke's spot.Yes Smoke, at the same time you 
                                  saw him defending you, he tried to convince 
                                  me that HE should take over. &gt; &gt; Of course, 
                                  that idea didnt fly, and, when it did'nt, once 
                                  again, he made his power play by trying to start 
                                  a little inner circle and bad mouthing Arcane, 
                                  Teddi and myself every chance he got. THAT'S 
                                  a bond? Some non-existant self important pompous 
                                  fool who has'nt contributed squat to the guild 
                                  in over two years, and goes around bad mouthing 
                                  folks who are currently running the guild, and, 
                                  while acting on one side to be the biggest supporter 
                                  of Smoke on one hand, is, on the other hand, 
                                  suggesting that HE take over for a while? &gt;

                                  Me? Ya, I can be soft at times. Wanna know why? 
                                  Cause...OOC...this is a group of friends who 
                                  are supposed to be having fun together.Thats 
                                  about it. FUN. Yes, we strive to be the best, 
                                  and, to have inspire respect and fear, but, 
                                  running around playing little power games aint 
                                  what it is about. Folks say I &quot;Politic&quot;...well..maybe 
                                  thats the way you see it, I see it as peacemaking.After 
                                  all, ya can be evil without being a jerk...but...those 
                                  who are natural jerks wouldnt understand that.

                                <P><font size="-1">&quot;One of the problems that 
                                  some of us older ITB's had was that the bulk 
                                  of the posts made by KAAOS members in the last 
                                  few months were right on the money. The fact 
                                  of the matter was, we WERE in bad shape and 
                                  everyone knew it. Its pretty difficult to be 
                                  as cocky as an ITB should be when you have to 
                                  turn tail and run from the public boards. The 
                                  only thing most of COULD do is just look for 
                                  the comedy factor and post about that. It also 
                                  helped that Neurosis effectively reduced the 
                                  overall credibility of KAAOS so much.&quot; 
                                  <BR>
                                  <BR>
                                  &quot;Kaaos might have had better stats from 
                                  PvP competitions and so forth but ITB had NW 
                                  staffers!... I always wondered who thought THAT 
                                  was so cool?&quot; &quot;At one time we had 
                                  to have a secret group of members within the 
                                  ITB's called the Inner Circle. Pretty much the 
                                  only reason we had this group was to keep the 
                                  NW Staff members who were ITB's out of ITB's 
                                  business. When Skorp became GM and an NW Staffer 
                                  in the same month, he tried to shut down the 
                                  Inner Circle. That was one of the main reasons 
                                  why I left the game for a year... I came back 
                                  when Skorp wasn't GM again... I didn't like 
                                  NW Staff running ITB&quot; <BR>
                                  <BR>
                                  &quot;I don't know most of the younger members 
                                  but I did have occasion to fight one or two 
                                  of them when I came back. I wanted to see if 
                                  they were up to snuff. Some were quite good 
                                  but most of them I kicked up down and sideways 
                                  around a PvP... it was really disgusting how 
                                  very bad their skills were, and I was so rusty 
                                  I was a little disgusted with MYSELF most the 
                                  time. What really popped my gaskets was when 
                                  I got handed some Email from the SAME guy I 
                                  kicked the crap out of and he's trying to organize 
                                  a revolt and throw us Elder types out! When 
                                  I heard that he did it after getting advice 
                                  from Skorp, it was Inner Circle time all over 
                                  again.&quot; <BR>
                                  <BR>
                                  &quot;I still think that there are about 80 
                                  members on the ITB roster. I don't think that 
                                  1/2 of them even know that NWN is shut down 
                                  yet. They might have valid AOL accounts but 
                                  they never read thier mail or participated in 
                                  any way. Such was the admissions policy of ITB 
                                  in the latter months, I guess. ::shrug::&quot;

                                  &quot;I feel kinda sorry for Skorp even if he 
                                  is trying to disparage my name and kick me out 
                                  of ITB for stating my feelings on the matter. 
                                  Its like he's the last guy standing in NWN and 
                                  can't realize that its time to pack it up and 
                                  move on... Its got to be hard on him. He's given 
                                  his everything to be &quot;somebody&quot; and 
                                  worked hard for a company that ended up folding 
                                  up and throwing him out on the street. He'll 
                                  never be able to be &quot;somebody&quot; in 
                                  another game. Nobody respects a guy that sells 
                                  out his guild to AOL staff, gets freaked out 
                                  if someone criticizes him about it, and cannot 
                                  let go of a DOS 386 16 color game. They might 
                                  pity him but, he'll never get the respect he 
                                  thinks he deserves.&quot; </font></P>

                                  he booted him. THATS the way to handle things,

                                  welp, IMHO it was handled fairly well, until 
                                  it leaked out. Folks went to senior member's/Officers 
                                  with their concerns, and, for the most part 
                                  it was handled internally.Until it leaked via 
                                  forwarded mail, which, is wrong. Mail is like 
                                  talking man to man...or Bro to Sis, or whatever...and...mail 
                                  shouldnt be forwarded unless its ok with EVERYONE

                                  that I'm not expected to post my feelings about 
                                  how I feel the guild should be run or changed 
                                  during these times. I guess thats because I 
                                  don't agree with Skorp, yea? Well, I think thats 
                                  a bit of bullshit.</font></P>
                                <P><font size="-1">Skorp? Would you ask Cormyr 
                                  what HE'S done for ITB lately? Silent? Vortex? 
                                  How much unmittigated gaul do you have concidering 
                                  I was instrumental in PUTTING you in the GM 
                                  slot? I wrote the ITB Bible, defined the ranking 
                                  system, certified the ITB logo and had my artist 
                                  create it (we were first, as you will recall), 
                                  shit... I can't believe I'm sitting here trying 
                                  to justify myself as an ITB... If anyone who 
                                  knows me DOESN'T think I've earned my wings 
                                  around here feel free to step forward... yourself 
                                  included Skorp... it will do these people well 
                                  to hear your unabashed rantings.</font></P>

                                  of context, you've gone balistic and become

                                  and Skorp. I have opinions about the guild, 
                                  its leadership, and its future and by stating 
                                  them Skorp wants to kick me out.... well fine. 
                                  If I get mail from 20 members (we have 60 or 
                                  so on the roster) I will leave and kiss Skorps 
                                  ass while doing it... otherwise, you can continue 
                                  personally slandering my name but you'll never 
                                  get to boot me.</font></P>

                                  I think that the current problems eminate from 
                                  a mode of leadership vastly dissimilar from 
                                  those that the guild was based on. You think 
                                  that should make me bootable? I'm very impressed 
                                  that you can call me egotistical.</font></P>

                                  and has been blown way out of proportion. Faust, 
                                  no one has ever said that you can't voice your 
                                  concerns. What was said was, the way you previously 
                                  DID voice your concerns was inappropriate. </font></P>
                                <P><font size="-1">Look at your last letter - 
                                  calling a former friend one of the most paranoid 
                                  people you have ever met? Please, drop the personal 
                                  stuff and get to the point: you don't like the 
                                  way the guild leadership has handled things. 
                                  Fine. But because people don't cowtow to you 
                                  and your demands does not warrant a verbal lashing 
                                  by you. If you were really interested in this 
                                  bond, you would be working to strengthen the 
                                  bond, and not creating more inner guild bashing. 
                                  Since when has negativity gotten anyone anywhere?</font></P>

                                  all was to create more inner political strife. 
                                  And, as evidenced by your most recent post, 
                                  I have reason to believe this may be true. </font></P>

                                  when you post it for all to see? My advice to 
                                  you is this: Leave the attitude at the guild 
                                  door. Go out there and have some fun. If you 
                                  feel the need to bash, bash on people outside 
                                  of this guild. But if causing problems for your 
                                  friends within this guild is your kinda fun, 
                                  then please leave.</font></P>

                                  of Skorps unraveling just lately but it is somewhat 
                                  sad as well. My posts concerning feelings about 
                                  ITB's internal strife and its ability to survive 
                                  a move to Ultima Online were, IMHO, professional 
                                  assessments of a situation inwhich I am directly 
                                  involved. The Arcane situation was NOT handled 
                                  properly IMHO and Skorp himself told me it would 
                                  rend ITB to an unreparable state. I'm afraid 
                                  that they only added to the truth of the matter 
                                  when Skorp went ballistic. It was replied to 
                                  by Teddi stating that she wants everyone to 
                                  just get along and ignore any troubles we've 
                                  had or will have and I noted that that post 
                                  took several personal swipes at me as well. 
                                  She stated that I was out of touch and didn't 
                                  know what I was talking about. These same feelings 
                                  sound almost a direct quote from several of 
                                  Skorps posts and emails of the weeks previous.</font></P>
                                <P><font size="-1">I replied to Onyx stating that 
                                  I was tired and sick of being a little pussy 
                                  of a House ITB that used to be tough. Skorp 
                                  chased Onyx off right away. So much for Onyx, 
                                  right? He crossed Skorp and you can't do that 
                                  in ITB, right? I then received ICQ message from 
                                  skorp inwhich he called me an &quot;asshole&quot;, 
                                  told me to &quot;fuck off&quot;, etc. yes, he's 
                                  quite the peacemaker isn't he. I didn't save 
                                  these and didn't even read several but I assure 
                                  you they were considerably less than lucid and 
                                  you could almost hear the foam dripping from 
                                  his muzzle as he screamed and yelled.</font></P>
                                <P><font size="-1">He then forwarded me a note 
                                  calling my more names and within the forwarded 
                                  note/post he twisted every action I'd been involved 
                                  in for the past few months. Saying that I told 
                                  him that many members might not feel that Smoke 
                                  was the best leader (Do you think that this 
                                  was news to Smoke?), that I was asked to take 
                                  control for a while (a thought forwarded to 
                                  me from Master AND Cormyr independently AND 
                                  reviewed with Smoke). He even outlined Arcanes 
                                  actions as &quot;letting us know he was interested 
                                  in a leadership position&quot;. Rather than 
                                  the reality of the situation, a forcible overthrow 
                                  that was outlined in the email we intercepted. 
                                  He threatened (yet again) to quit if (this time) 
                                  I wasn't booted out of the guild. HE CALLED 
                                  FOR THE VOTE TO HAVE ME BOOTED, NOT I. All this 
                                  heaped on me for saying anything to the effect 
                                  of ITB's shortcomings. I'm not innocent of being 
                                  an Evil backstabber... but who doesn't know 
                                  that? Skorp is pretty well known as a backstabber 
                                  as well, are we not Chaotic Evil? He then continued 
                                  to send ICQ messages yelling and screaming at 
                                  me. To this point, I have turned off his ability 
                                  to send me ICQ messages because they just continued 
                                  to get more and more ridiculous. In the last 
                                  one I sent to him I asked what the parliamentary 
                                  procedure would be for an Elder to kick another 
                                  Elder out. He replied that although several 
                                  of the older and more official members of ITB 
                                  would back me (he made a list) he &quot;had 
                                  all the footies and mercs&quot; and he would 
                                  drop us and take them. I'm still wondering where 
                                  he began thinking that ITB had suddenly become 
                                  a democratic guild.... I also, had had enough. 
                                  He is now summarily &quot;ignored&quot;. It 
                                  occurred to me that there is nothing Skorp would 
                                  want more than for me to quit. I am one of the 
                                  few people who have been around enough to know 
                                  when something is bullshit and I'm one of the 
                                  fewer people around that will call him on it! 
                                  Once he gets rid of me and a few others he can 
                                  command and redefine ITB all he wants... THIS 
                                  is what pisses me off... he will be riding on 
                                  the hard work and reputation built by several 
                                  of my better friends and yes, even myself. He 
                                  can stand around and laud the praises of ITB 
                                  but the bulk of the people who built that house 
                                  would not find it a home any more... getting 
                                  rid of me would allow him to forget that.</font></P>
                                <P><font size="-1">In the meantime I chatted with 
                                  several of my friends who happen to be KAAOS. 
                                  As you will recall I set up a working relationship 
                                  with KAAOS so that we could enter a new game 
                                  and work together instead of appart. Skorp put 
                                  this down as a stupid idea but I'm working with 
                                  them already. At my request they kept the bulk 
                                  of it off the boards but of late I've told them 
                                  I didn't care what they did. Skorps shown me 
                                  his true face and at times I wouldn't mind punching 
                                  it out. I was actually impressed with their 
                                  restraint. I've been pissed, waiting for a call 
                                  from Smoke and had few who cared to even listen. 
                                  (If you have not noticed, I'm still pretty pissed)</font></P>
                                <P><font size="-1">Then I ventured onto the Internet 
                                  boards and see that Skorp have been continuing 
                                  to bash me and my actions. &quot;WTF have you 
                                  done for ITB lately? Heh!&quot; and some mention 
                                  to my &quot;fat&quot; lips (??) talking to &quot;anyone 
                                  who would listen&quot;. In this case my &quot;fat&quot; 
                                  lips were talking to the only persons who WOULD 
                                  listen, my friends.... I've even talked to Skorp 
                                  about my feelings but he doesn't seem interested 
                                  in what I have to say... my way is hard and 
                                  means being hard on people who cannot stand 
                                  to the test... I've made suggestions and commented 
                                  on recommendations before, to members of ITB's 
                                  leadership. In each case Skorp and Teddi have 
                                  basically shut down any idea I've had saying 
                                  that I didn't have a clue... well, look around 
                                  you... you tell ME if I've got a clue. I predicted 
                                  that the personalities of the Bond would prohibit 
                                  it from future prosperity... I don't want to 
                                  see who and what... just tell me... are the 
                                  personalities of ITB prohibiting its prosperity 
                                  or no???</font></P>
                                <P><font size="-1">I don't have to remind everyone 
                                  that Skorp has been repeatedly upset and over 
                                  reactive while the last days of NWN were in 
                                  progress. News of his continued exploits of 
                                  yelling at people and then logging, trying to 
                                  bust previously &quot;good friends&quot; for 
                                  hacking and generally losing all senses of &quot;cool&quot; 
                                  have pervaded those of us who wonder aloud at 
                                  such things (I hazard to say that I am a little 
                                  bit &quot;in touch&quot; despite Skorp's repeated 
                                  mentions of my lack thereof).</font></P>
                                <P><font size="-1">I personally think that I have 
                                  been repeatedly attacked by Skorp, he obviously 
                                  thinks this is going both directions. I'll admit, 
                                  I am sorely tempted to knock his block off. 
                                  I have been in constant contact with Lilyth 
                                  and she feels that Skorp is under the impression 
                                  that she is out to get him as well (this couldn't 
                                  be farther from the truth in her case). In my 
                                  case, I will put up with the fight only to further 
                                  strengthen my own position.... I've never been 
                                  one to back down from a fight, even if it is 
                                  only me that perceives that there is a fight 
                                  to be had. As Skorp continues to babble on with 
                                  his threats and callous attacks on people whom 
                                  once called him friend it will become more and 
                                  more obvious that he has breached the ludicrous 
                                  and the power plays are more about him and his 
                                  insecurity than they are about anyone else.</font></P>
                                <P><font size="-1">He asked me if I was sorry 
                                  that I &quot;fucked with him&quot;. I responded 
                                  that the only person I saw doing any fucking 
                                  was him, and it was a one man show. What can 
                                  we do for Skorp to get him to sit down and let 
                                  someone else take the reigns? Is this guild 
                                  run by Skorp and Skorp alone? Is this ITB or 
                                  is this something that started out as ITB and 
                                  now just uses its name? Hell, I don't want to 
                                  take the reigns, I've got something of my own 
                                  going and I'm rather enjoying it, thank you. 
                                  But I've been a member of ITB for a long time. 
                                  I refer to it as a positive experience and people 
                                  know that I am not a newbie because of my background 
                                  and experience with the guild. The staff of 
                                  Origin seems to think so even if younger members 
                                  such as Monk don't show the least bit of respect 
                                  for me... they do. Seeing ITB crater because 
                                  of one persons instability would be a shame. 
                                  Either we need to shut ITB down, or we need 
                                  to quell this storm of rediculousness. He's 
                                  going off and creating personality issues that 
                                  are unwarranted and unneeded. He's, frankly, 
                                  trying to manipulate the bond in such a way 
                                  as to rend all control from elected and respected 
                                  members be them old or new, they must conform 
                                  to his will or suffer his abuse. This is a time 
                                  when cooler heads must take control. If I am 
                                  correct about my theories concerning ITB's inability's 
                                  to find its way to a place as complex and massive 
                                  as UO then I will be correct about the reasoning 
                                  behind it... starting with personalities in 
                                  battle with themselves.</font></P>
                                <P><font size="-1">In Conclusion, yes I'm pissed. 
                                  No, I don't think NW staffers should have been 
                                  allowed to run the guild (Skorp actually MADE 
                                  that rule). Yes, I think admissions was less 
                                  than adequate in recent years (I created the 
                                  process btw). No, I don't think I'm ready to 
                                  jump out there and wave the ITB banner right 
                                  now and No, I don't think being a cheerleader 
                                  equates to being a leader. Go ahead, scream 
                                  bloody murder but what I've done for ITB recently 
                                  is NOT put up with the bullshit and frankly, 
                                  some of our members could use a role model in 
                                  that department. You want to lock us in a room 
                                  until we solve it? Fine. But it will be bloody. 
                                  As I've said, I'm pissed off and I'm not going 
                                  to kiss anyones ass because he tells me to.</font></P>

                                  were moving on, and, in your final post, proceeded

                                  the GM spot of ITB. I did it when you and I 
                                  booted Lich, I did it again when you tried to 
                                  reform the inner circle (gee, thats a great 
                                  idea...lets further fractionalize the guild) 
                                  and, finally, I did it when you said that if 
                                  folks thought SMoke was doing a bad job (during 
                                  the Arcane issue), that you should take over

                                  quiet proud of how well the ITB's controlled

                                  I dont agree with hacking, and, if the system 
                                  popped someone in the dungeon for hacking, I 
                                  would HAVE to bust them, but...LOL..I was never 
                                  much of a hacker hunter....as a matter of fact, 
                                  I NEVER busted one that the system didnt nail

                                  ICQ'ed me with your demands that I get a petition

                                  This guild can easily operate on name alone 
                                  and MOST of the Pkillers in the game pay a great 
                                  deal of attention to them. <BR>
                                  <BR>
                                  For several years the guild was essentially 
                                  the monsters most challenging to kill and people 
                                  dreamed of one day either becoming or beating 
                                  them. Everyone (at one time) wanted to be an 
                                  ITB and only the best could get in. Once this 
                                  policy changed the guild started going down 
                                  hill. Currently this guild is more concerned 
                                  with internal strife involving a fight over 
                                  power and a lot of personnel problems concerning 
                                  old leaders who cannot give it up and young 
                                  members who don't know the first thing about 
                                  how to run a guild. There are very good people 
                                  here though. Exceptionally skill and adaptive 
                                  players. One is writing his own video game and 
                                  that takes all his time. The current GM (Guild 
                                  Master) is a former truck driver who used to 
                                  show up in everyone's home town from time to 
                                  time drawing us all into a tight group of friends. 
                                  Another former leader is so far up the butt 
                                  of all the current and former staffers in NW 
                                  that he knows just about everything about everyone.... 
                                  he is, however, somewhat delusional about his 
                                  popularity.&nbsp;(Ed. note:&nbsp;ROFL!!) One 
                                  is a staff member at Lucas Art's, a game manufacturer.<BR>
                                  <BR>
                                  Another proposed a revolt to throw out the 10 
                                  top (eldest) members a little while ago sending 
                                  the guild into a huge tailspin ending only because 
                                  NWN was announced as closing.<BR>
                                  This situation prevails in the current mentality 
                                  of the guild and divisions are insufferable 
                                  in such a group. Lots of these people (the guild 
                                  membership) are, in one way or another, being 
                                  demoralized because of the internal strife and, 
                                  quite frankly, I don't see an end to it given 
                                  the personalities involved. As these people 
                                  become more and more alienated they will begin 
                                  to break off and look for independent homes. 
                                  I have notified every one of them that despite 
                                  previous political adversity I would make them 
                                  at home in whatever capacity possible here in 
                                  UO. This might involve you and my &quot;team&quot; 
                                  or it might not, we'll wait and see what the 
                                  individual wants. I feel I should let you know 
                                  that I will go way out of my way to assist any 
                                  ITB requesting my assistance (without breaking 
                                  certain confidences of course) No news concerning 
                                  an &quot;official move&quot; to Ultima Online 
                                  and they might be going to another game anyway 
                                  as NWN shuts down. </font></P>
