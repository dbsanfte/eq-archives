            <H1><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Six Circles 
              of the Adept Game Player</font></H1>
          </CENTER>
          <H2><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What's My Point</font></H2>
          <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I've been thinking 
            about writing this document for some time, but never seemed to get 
            around to it. I&nbsp;have been watching the recent exodus of experienced 
            players from the game, however, and it has really spurred the urge 
            for me to put this together to possibly stop the good players from 
            leaving.</font></p>
          <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There's definitely 
            a large number of problems with Ultima Online. That's clear. But for 
            as many disappointments as the bugs cause, I&nbsp;see more people 
            walking away disgusted because of their interaction with other players. 
            What strikes me about this is that the people involved just don't 
            see the whole cycle. They don't understand how and why the players 
            play the way they do, and because of that they don't see how the current 
            behavior of most of the UO players can ever lead to the kind of gaming 
            experience they're looking for.</font></p>
          <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Even beyond that, 
            I think there are a large number of players who don't understand what 
            the best aspects are of a role playing multi-player game. I see lots 
            of people playing UO exactly like it's a single player game. They're 
            exploring the challenges of NPCs and stat building, finishing that 
            part of the cycle, getting bored, and moving on.</font></p>
          <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So what I've 
            written is a description of the &quot;Circles&quot; of game playing. 
            The better you are, the higher your circle.</font></p>
          <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">By doing this 
            I'm hoping to:</font></p>
          <ol>
            <li><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Encourage 
              players in the early parts of the cycle to advance through to the 
              later parts</font></li>
            <li><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Help the advanced 
              players to clearly understand that there IS&nbsp;a cycle of game 
              playing, and that beginning players need time to develop to the 
              point where they can participate at the high level that the advanced 
              players want to play at. Ultima is a YOUNG&nbsp;game, with young 
              players (in a game-hours played sense), and because of this it's 
              unavoidable that until the community for this game matures, the 
              high-level interaction of the 6th Circle game players is going to 
              be rare.</font></li>
            <li><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I'm hoping 
              there's an outside chance that OSI will read this, and pick up a 
              little insight into the few aspects of gaming that they might not 
              have already thought of. It's CRUCIAL&nbsp;that OSI&nbsp;as a company 
              understand that they should be designing the game and all its updates 
              around making the 5th and 6th circles of play better. ALL&nbsp;aspects 
              of those circles. Including PVP improvements, chat improvements, 
              better boards, and role play environments. Maybe they already know 
              this stuff, and just have too much work to do on the basics to worry 
              about it, but if they don't, then I'm hoping they read this.</font></li>
          </ol>
          <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The good news 
            is, if you wait for it, it will come (especially given OSI's willingness 
            to constantly update the game to make sure the environment encourages 
            this).</font></p>
          <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The information 
            below is based on real observations of the cycle of game play for 
            hundreds of players. It's not something I invented, it's something 
            I have experienced myself, and watched others experience it. The observations 
            I'm making come from a long history of playing online games, and/or 
            participating in online communities. In some way shape or form, I've 
            been hanging with people online since around 1986, beginning with 
            pre-internet (or at least pre publicly used, web based internet) local 
            6 person chat rooms and BBSes, up through services like AOL, through 
            online games, out onto the internet, etc. Not that I'm particularly 
            interested in boring you with my &quot;credentials&quot;, but I think 
            it's important to know that I've seen alot of this shit, and that 
            I'm not just guessing about how it works. For over 10 years, one way 
            or another, I've been watching people interact online. In terms of 
            player interactive computer games, I've played Diablo, MageStorm, 
            Doom (I&amp;II), Duke Nuk'em, Quake, War Craft, War Craft 2, Solaria, 
            dabbled in some MUDs and probably most importantly, a game called 
            Neverwinter Nights based on AD&amp;D rules that allowed 200 or so 
            players at once for over 3 years. Offline, I've dabbled in D&amp;D, 
            AD&amp;D, Magic: The Gathering, and off-line computer games.</font></p>
          <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For whatever 
            it's worth, here's what I've seen. (I've tried to keep this main document 
            streamlined to provide a relatively quick read on my main point - 
            the cycle of game maturity. There's a ton of good detail on each section 
            that I'm not providing here, but my intention is over time to write 
            more sections, and hyperlink to them from this document. If you wanna 
            get deep into it, you can follow those, if not, just breeze this top 
            layer).</font></p>
          <H1><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Game Maturity</font></H1>
          <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Most players 
            move through a hierarchy of playing, advancing through states of maturity 
            as characters and players in the game. I don't mean maturity in the 
            sense of real world adult sensibilities, I just mean in terms of fully 
            developed game skills, knowledge, and characters. The point of writing 
            this up is this: think about where you're at in this cycle, think 
            about where the people that you're playing with are at in this cycle, 
            and think about what the over-all effect on the gaming experience 
            will be in Ultima once enough people have been around long enough 
            to make it through these stages. </font></p>
          <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">That's the whole 
            key. The highest forms of play are in the upper stages. The player 
            base has not had time to reach them on a general level, which means 
            finding people that are high enough up the circles to play with is 
            tough.. (Pursuit of the lower circles often leads to what other players 
            consider or &quot;power&quot; playing and that some call &quot;abusive&quot;.)</font></p>
          <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(Also, worth 
            mentioning is the fact that some of us out there may not have even 
            tried to go through each of these Circles in Ultima. Players like 
            me come from other environments where we already did this, so we know 
            what type of character and play style we like. As a result, we make 
            a b-line for that niche, without stopping in the other circles. You 
            may recognize yourself in this category.)</font></p>
          <H2><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The First Circle 
            - Survival</font></H2>
          <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When players 
            first start the game, they're newbies. Their main concern is acquiring 
            enough stats, skills, money, weapons, armor, etc. just to survive. 
            They want to do things in the game without risking death at every 
            turn.</font></p>
          <H2><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Second Circle 
            - Competence</font></H2>
          <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Once you're starting 
            to get your stuff together, you're less worried about just staying 
            alive, and more into developing a higher level of competence. You're 
            rolling through lower-level creatures, and common challenges, beating 
            them, and gaining momentum. Game play finally starts to feel a little 
            &quot;fun&quot;.</font></p>
          <H2><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Third Circle 
            - Beat the Game / Excel</font></H2>
          <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Once you're pretty 
            good, you start getting determined to be &quot;really&quot; good. 
            You get the best armor, the best magic, the best skills, etc. etc. 
            If you've got that, usually you start trying to beat the game. You 
            find the toughest monsters, and baddest dungeons, and take 'em on 
            in a full charge. Unfortuneatly, this is also around the time that 
            certain players start finding and exploiting bugs. As part of the 
            urge to beat the game, they beat the hell out of it... by cheating.</font></p>
          <H2><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Fourth Circle 
            - Prove your Mastery</font></H2>
          <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Ok, so you've 
            got it, the best of everything... so now what? Well, this is a social 
            game. Multi-player games are all about interacting with other real 
            people. So if you want to prove how good you are, you've got two choices. 
            People pick whatever is their style, but almost everybody moves into 
            either</font></p>
          <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1) Helping others 
            (taking bands adventuring, handing out stuff, teaching newbies, etc. 
            Note: this is NOT the same thing as Role Play, that's covered the 
            5th Circle) or,</font></p>
          <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">2) Killing others 
            (kill everyone, including those who have no chance at beating you 
            and then taunt them with the fact that you did it. Note: this is Player 
            Killing, it is NOT the same thing as Player versus Player which is 
            covered in the next Circle.)</font></p>
          <H2><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Fifth Circle 
            - Seek New Challenges</font></H2>
          <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now here's where 
            it gets interesting. And also dangerous for OSI. There's a limited 
            number of things to do in a game that can be programmed into it. It's 
            at this point that people have exhausted them. They need something 
            new, and there are only a few options left. The point is that no matter 
            WHAT&nbsp;OSI does, they just can't program an ever-changing environment 
            that will hold the interest of real people for an indefinite period 
            of time. It can't be done. It's not possible.</font></p>
          <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What can be done 
            is to set up an environment in which people amuse themselves. Once 
            people have used up all the pre-programmed challenges, there's nothing 
            left but to interact with other people, and that's what most/all of 
            the Fifth Circle is about. If OSI has designed a game that doesn't 
            support 1 through 7 very well, then people will head straight for 
            number 8, and UO&nbsp;will die out.</font></p>
          <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There are a number 
            of options to turn to in the Fifth Circle, and which way you turn 
            is a matter of who you are. Depending on your inclination, you might 
            pick any one of them. When you've fully explored the one you pick 
            first, if you're like most true gamers, you'll just move on to one 
            of the others. The longer you've played, the more accepting you are 
            of ALL&nbsp;of these aspects, because you've tried more and more of 
            them, and realize and understand the merits of them.</font></p>
          <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I've tried to 
            list them in the order that most seem to move through them, but it's 
            fairly likely that the average player will just skip around to whatever 
            holds their interest. The DEGREE&nbsp;to which you explore these is 
            also variable. If you're not very strategic, you might just barely 
            touch PVP, but then get neck-deep into RP, or visa versa. The bottom 
            line, though is that since all of these items are about interacting 
            with other people (except MAYBE #1), if you don't have other people 
            to interact with that are exploring the category you've chosen, then 
            you don't have anything. That's the problem that UO&nbsp;is suffering 
            from right now. Anyway, here they are:</font></p>
          <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>1) Different 
            classes</B> - roll a new guy, start over, and develop him differently. 
            Really get to know the nuances of the advatages and disadvantages 
            of the various character types.</font></p>
          <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>2) PVP (player 
            vs. player)</B>- aaahhh! Now here's the real beauty. Fighting NPCs 
            is a chore, fighting real people (in the right game environment) is 
            an ART! UO&nbsp;has yet to see ANY&nbsp;of this to my knowledge. All 
            it has is PK (player killing). Simplistic brainless slug fests with 
            no technique or talent. This art will develop. The highest form of 
            this is 1 on 1 (in my opinion anyway, although could change my mind 
            yet). And for those who think that the UO&nbsp;interface precludes 
            this, let me just say that there are a TON of ideas that have not 
            been explored yet. And unlike many other games, if there's things 
            that make it suck, just get 'em to change it. Now I agree, bug exploitation 
            for instant kills is a joke. I'm not talking about that. I'm talking 
            about the ART&nbsp;of PVP. Nothing in this brief paragraph can describe 
            the full scope of PVP, so don't underestimate it.</font></p>
          <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>3) RP (Role 
            Play)</B> - Playing an actual character, whatever your actual activities 
            are (pk, pvp, guide, helper, whatever) adds a spice and newness to 
            the game like nothing else. In my opinion, if you combine this with 
            #2 above, you've reached the pinnacle of game playing.</font></p>
          <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>4) Chat Room</B> 
            - as stupid as it sounds (to me anyway), lots of people get in a game, 
            conquer the basic challenges, make some friends, and then forget it 
            was ever a game. They just hang out and chat with the people they've 
            met. I don't condone this, but nonetheless it's the last stage for 
            alot of people. However, my own observation is that the chat interface 
            in UO is pretty bad, so people won't really chat in this game.</font></p>
          <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>5) Flame Wars 
            / Board RPs </B>- this is something almost undeveloped by OSI, but 
            you can't overlook it. Where ever there are boards to be had in multi-player 
            games, there's a class of people who specialize in just verbally taking 
            people apart, and/or posting RP and such. When this is based around 
            actual game events, it becomes very involving. Well worth participating.</font></p>
          <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>6) Intrigue 
            / Events / Guilds</B> - Where ever people go they form organizations 
            with purposes. Those orgs compete or conflict, and this is the heart 
            of the political posturing in MPGs. Very cool stuff.</font></p>
          <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>7) Occupations</B> 
            - this is a new one in graphical MPGs. It's what OSI has created by 
            taking a stab at creating a real economy. I'm not sure how this will 
            work out in the end once things are balanced, but it's definitely 
            a challenge. Be a merchant, a sailor, a miner for hire, whatever... 
            interesting.</font></p>
          <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>8) THE BIG 
            SCARY ONE FOR OSI - GO GET A NEW GAME.</B> People get bored. Some 
            have the inclination to get involved in the other seven final challenges, 
            and some don't. A lot of what determines if people stay with a game 
            is how well the game supports the above 7 items. Programmed challenges 
            NEVER&nbsp;keep people fascinated. You just can't program an NPC to 
            be smart enough, funny enough, aggressive enough, cool enough, unpredictable 
            enough, etc. to hold a real person's attention for any length of time. 
            Your average player probably breezes through the first 4 circles inside 
            of 3 to 6 months of play time (depending on how many actual hours 
            they play). Once that's over, if the game can't support and support 
            WELL real staying-power playing that the 7 above give, then you might 
            as well stick a fork in it, it's done.</font></p>
          <p><b><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Sixth 
            Circle - Zen Game Play, Everything is One</font></b></p>
          <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This is the final 
            circle of game play. This is the stage at which a player appeciates 
            all aspects of the Fifth Circle. When you have a world full of the 
            ultimate players, they combines everything above and create a challenging, 
            human interacting, role played world with a wide variety of classes, 
            game play styles, and occupations based around a system of competition 
            that demands skill, thought, reflex, and strategy to compete (whether 
            that be in PVP, role play, intrigue, competitive business, whatever).</font></p>
          <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You can only 
            reach this circle if the conditions are right. First, you have to 
            be the right type of person. You need to have an attention span, a 
            desire to interact with others, imagination, a love of challenge, 
            and a strategic mind. Second, you have to have the right type of game. 
            The place where you play has to be capable of supporting all of the 
            above elements in an interface that really allows you to explore them 
            all. The extent to which it does NOT&nbsp;support them is directly 
            tied to how soon you basically throw up your arms, conclude that you 
            can never reach the higher circles in this environment, and boogie 
            looking for that next online game.</font></p>
          <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When you reach 
            this level, it could be with a varying amount of skill in any of the 
            5th circle challenges. Some people specialize in one or two, and are 
            very light on the others, some are renaissance men and are well rounded 
            in them all. The key thing is that you recognize all of them and their 
            merits, and are able to integrate yourself into the elite class of 
            characters who play them all without limiting the interaction of any 
            of them.</font></p>
          <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">That means more 
            than the common attitude of &quot;I play my way, you play your way, 
            just leave me alone.&quot; RPers need to realize that RPing in Disney 
            is not what this particular game is about. It's about RPing in a vicious 
            medieval realm, where death is very real. PKers need to realize that 
            beyond just slaying the helpless, fighting even battles is where it's 
            at, and that even beyond that, making someone feel like they're just 
            been destroyed by an evil lord rampaging across the realms is hugely 
            better than feeling like they've been destroyed by a 15 year old brat, 
            rampaging across an environment only slightly more sophistaced than 
            a Nintendo game.</font></p>
          <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And don't forget, 
            you goodie RPers, PKing isn't just for evils. There's nothing wrong 
            with killing other players in the name of good. ;&gt;</font></p>
          <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Hopefully this 
            was at least semi-interesting, and more to the point, I hope it makes 
            a few people think about why things aren't just the way they like 
            them right now, and points out that given time, there's a good chance 
            that will change.</font></p>
