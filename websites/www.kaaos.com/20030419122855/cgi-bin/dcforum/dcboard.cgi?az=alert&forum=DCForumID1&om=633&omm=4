I was right on most posts when I said numbers would be better than quality in Shadowbane. If you have 100 rank 2 players or 100 level 30 players then you can slaughter KAAOS in a minute or maybe two. So what if your team has 50 level 50 players. 100 can beat them. So that proves I have a brain.

#2
I still have people responding to my posts. Enough said.

#3
Losers go away when they think they lost. I don’t think I lost one fight yet.

#4
Everyone has some kind of personality, even a no-brainer like yourself.

#5
I never said I was superior to all. It is just that I know everyone thinks they are right here. Which is not the case.

#6
Where is the bad news? I bring good tidings to all except KAAOS. KAAOS will not see the good because they pass judgments to all non KAAOSers. 

#7
I am not calling myself god at least. 

#8
I wasn’t aware that there WAS a topic. It goes the other way around most times.

#9
Maybe if you tell me what I claim to be then we can start somekind of real topic instead of this crap.

#10
You can be a loser and a leader at the same time. Just look at history.

#11
If I lacked communications skills then there would be no reason to be mad at me or respond to my posts.

#12
What does that have to do with gaming? Most gamers don’t have a real life.
