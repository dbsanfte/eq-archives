         His eyes opened with a jolt, and his mouth opened to scream fractions of a second later.  Panic flowed through his muscles as adrenalin, and that nameless fear of not-knowing coursed through his blood - wild horses stampeding down his veins and through his heart.<P>He was held hard inside.  And as he lay there, it settled down over him and filled itself into every corner of him.  His wordless scream never escaped.  Only his terror vibrated out of his body in waves and currents while he struggled to move and could not.<P>The thing rushed into his mouth as he screamed, it flooded into his nostrils, it poured into his eyes, it crawled into his ears, and strangled itself around his throat.  His eyes widened in silence as it felt its way down his throat, and dripped into his lungs.  A force - an imperative - a DEMAND welled up from every portion of him, INSISTING that there be breath.  There was not.<P>For long eternities he lay there, feeling his body dying by milimeters.  His eyes strained to burst from his head, and his chest sucked at the vacuum till it felt like it would collapse.<P>Small thoughts fired through his brain like sparks off of a dying fire.  Images and scenes.  A women, beautiful and nude straddled him, rising and falling as he thrust upward.  A street blown by a fierce wind stretched in front of him as he walked along.  His father snarled and rushed towards him.  A knife fell from the darkness towards him, and met with his hand, rising to block.  He stared down at his breakfast - eggs and ham.  A carriage roared across the road in front of him, clipping his shoulder with a wheel guard.  Two men carried a log toward the beginnings of a small house.<P>Flicker and burn out.  Each memory chased through him, and faded.<P>Underlying it all was a sense of himself that felt a bubbling mix of anger, fear, panic and sadness - the part of him that knew he was dying.  It was a quiet part, muffled to quietness while lethargy and the poisons of his own body swirled up and slowly drowned him inside his own skin.<P>a flash. dhhhhhhhhhhharkness.<P>.<P><BR>.<P><BR>.<P><BR>.<P>.<P><BR>Damarico convulsed, and gasped in a breath like a man clawing for a rope to save him as he falls off a cliff.  His chest heaved and his eyes bled with the effort of pouring air, sweet air, into his lungs.<P>After minutes of gulping and laboring, his senses returned and his heart slowed, and his cells stopped screaming for oxygen.  Every shred of him was exhausted by the near suffocation.  For an hour he lay there, simply breathing - his rough features smoothed into serenity by a single fact - he was alive.<P>Eventually he sat up.  The destruction around him, and the corpse that greeted him were surprises.  His friend lay dead.  Filish's mouth gaped in a way that Damarico found far too familiar, and far to personally meaningfull.<P>With a groan, Damarico stood and looked around, his blood-shot eyes blinking at what was left of the city he had lived in.<P>"Holy Mother of Fuck."<P><BR>Hedron<BR><a href="http://www.kaaos.com/hedron/falseprophet.htm" target="_blank">The False Prophet</a><BR><a href="http://www.kaaos.com" target="_blank">KAAOS</a><P>...No child, don't cry.
