I guess I did miss your better days.  I don't remember you from the dread days, that's for sure.  So, unless you were in a guild we fought with, like DE (before SiN) or FGB then I won't know you.  I was in WK and RGB during the dread era and I just can't seem to remember you.

Like I said in my post above, I remember you from that glow guild Drk, never leaving the glow teleporters and fighting from that small tower.

Now, as far as me having a "better place with rank in GoD than you do".  Of course I carry more weight.  For one, no one knows you.  Secondly, I have fought against GoD since the dread days as RGB, D-I, and a couple of other guilds. 

Now on to this "conservative" player bullshit.  What in God's name is a conservative player in an MMORPG?  I sure as hell don't know.  Of all the years that I played UO, it was balls to the wall.  I didn't care if I died, because I had fun regardless of the situation.  In RGB and WK, we'd have hour long fights against guilds like KAAOS, The Banes, etc.  Would that be considered conservative?  I wouldn't think so.  Unless by conservative, you mean you never changed throughout the different phases that OSI put into UO.  IE rep patch, precast, ren, pub 16.

Please enlighten me, oh God of the message board warriors.
