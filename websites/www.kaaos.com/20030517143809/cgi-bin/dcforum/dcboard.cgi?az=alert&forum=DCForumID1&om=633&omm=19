Some of my newer posts seem like works of art these days. Tell me if you think the same KAAOS. I expect more role play but try to be reasonable.

Read this over a few times and maybe you will understand the geo.http://kaaos.com/htdocs/dcforum/DCForumID1/637.html

It is all about leadership and being evil. As you can tell with the second part; evil guilds have no leadership.

So we have some good vs evil talk but no good vs evil match to play out with pvp. Find out why here.
http://kaaos.com/htdocs/dcforum/DCForumID1/631.html

Or just read this if you have no time:

There has been nothing but “mindless pvp” for online multiplayers and most evil players don’t seem to mind it at all. Too bad they don’t know what they are missing. A good pvp match to measure the wits within them. In KAAOS terms, “The anger that could be spewed out like a volcano. Only a perfect wave would be able to engage them to put out their steady stream of fire.” 

All I can get out of this is a couple of things. Either companies want to encourage more and more team play and kill off pvp or there is no one telling these game companies what we really want. Consider Shadowbane for example: Too many different factions, races, and mumbo jumbo which made pvp unbalanced. Everyone needs to depend on each other. Is this a making of a super hero or vile creature? I think not.
