<H1>UO - Adding Strategy to Melee</H1>

<p>This isn't TOO off topic, because of how the balance of the other classes affects mage tweaking by OSI. 

<p>I think you're right, but I've got a different idea of how to make Dex usefull other than just affecting weapon speed. 

<p>For the most part, warrior battles right now are boring. You run up to each other, you start the combat, and then you sit back with a beer and wait to see what happens. 

<p>YAWN! 

<p>OSI needs to set up the combat engine so that damage and defense is based upon relative position. For instance, two warriors directly facing each other get the full benefit of their tactical, weapons, AR, and parrying skills - BUT as they change position, those benefits vary. 

<p>For instance, if one player is facing the other full on, but is hitting the other one in the back, there's a 30% reduction to all those skills in application to the combat. If one is full on and attacking the side of the other person, a 15% reduction, etc. etc. 

<p>NOW, here's the interesting part. Because relative position matters ALOT in battle, if you just stand there while the other guy pushes through you, and start hitting your back, or circles to the side, you're in some deep trouble. 

<p>All of a sudden, warrior battles are interesting! Jockey for position, use a tree to break the pattern, and run around behind somebody! If yer STR and DEX is superior, push right through them, and attack from behind, etc. etc. Oh, and weapon swings should be interrupted by being pushed through, so that weaker quicker opponents would need to concentrate on hit and run. 

<p>If you combine this with more of a variation in weapon swing times, all of a sudden there's skill in weapons combat! Wow! Cool! 

<p>What do ya think?
