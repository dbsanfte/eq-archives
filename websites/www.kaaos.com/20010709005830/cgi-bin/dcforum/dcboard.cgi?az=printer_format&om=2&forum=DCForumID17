Answer #1<BR>Do you mean the recomendations for what books to read?  Opra's book of the week club?  No.  I've either read them or have differing opinions on what a good book is.  I'm not checking out news sites 20 times a day to find out what some ex-marine who works in pre-customer support for a pre-profit pre-release pre-execute-the-business-plan company has to say about literature.    <P>Personally I'm looking for real data on what SB will be like and don't get real excited when they say "Beta is almost here... in the mean time, go read 12 books!"  Its even LESS interesting than "Dwarves have a lot of strengh"... so what do 12 points of strength actually MEAN in the friggin GAME, Numbnuts?? (answer: We can't tell you or our competitors will rip off the idea.)<P>Answer #2<BR>Do you mean the Lore stuff they are propping up in lue of real information about the game?  Not reading much, no.  Once again, I'm looking for information on the game itself... not "Erolsi Marr and Guard Lucan used to date but Cazic Thul got upset and called The Tribuneral and made a fancy sword that only Lord British can jam up a ShadowLords ass..." (insert gods and Feature Characters as you prefer) <P>I mean, really.  Telling me that Minotaurs hate Elves doesn't mean squat if there are no factions or implications attached, so WTF do I care if the pro-genitor of Minotaurs had a fancy axe that a Dorf stole and melted down to make iron panties for his Aunt Jenny?  Are there any factions or real implications to dwarves hating Minotaurs or whatever?  if so... then I'm inerested.  It's just a time sink.  When the GAME comes out and IF it is playable THEN I'll dig into the backstory to the extent I need to.  The rest is just fluff designed for people who get off on Roleplaying Orcs... oh... Orcs that Play to Crush, right?  Look at the resume of this Meridian guy... he "always wanted to be a writer" (!)  That's Great Skippy!  I always wanted to be Porn Star but that doesn't mean I have a twelve inch Johnson!  If you want someone to create fiction for you... read any schmucks RP posts or have a beer with Ego and listen to him tell you about his Johnson! <P>By the way... has Arcane ever actually run a company before?  Has "Marketing Wizard" Todd Coleman ever actually been a Marketing Wizard anywhere but in Marketing 462 "Selling the Obvious".  What about Ashen Temper who learned everything there is to know about Customer Support while humping sand bags in the Marines?<P>Personally, I have yet to see anything but Theory and Concept out of these guys and we've all been lead down the primrose path on every single pre-beta game there ever was.  Think of what you EXPECTED Ultima Online to be 2 months before the Beta.  Think of what you EXPECTED EverQuest to be 2 months before the beta.  So do you really expect people who have played online games for over 10 years and put up with all the Bugs, Exploits, and Shitty Customer Service to simply bend over and suck the hype straight up their butts?  <P>Its fucking rediculous how many saps are oo-ing and awe-ing about every stupid word that rolls out of Wolfpacks happy goddam funball machine.<P>"Shadowbane is going to be our savior because they have uh... they have PvP and Guild vrs Guild stuff and..."<P>"Skippy, how does the PvP work?"<P>"Well you can build an Empire which is really cool and..."<P>"Skippy, is it better to have 500 members at level 3, or 3 members at level 500?"<P>"Well, we cant tell you that but the game is just gonna be peachy and Play to Crush, Dude!"<P>"Skippy, what about all this shit regarding different worlds having different physics with regards to Magic (etc) but then they say we can eventually world-hop to build an empire... could you explain what the fuck they are talking about?"<P>"Here, read this cliche storyline about knights in shining armor and villians who ruined the world and while your at it... the Tech Support guy loves these 15 books... maybe you should read them so you'll know how to play to crush" <P>"Skippy, you're giving me a headache"<P>~f<P>~f<P>~f <BR>

1. Arcane hasn't run a company before, but Warden has -- Warden hired Arcane to write an alpha business database transfer utility, which they sold as the main product of a company (Reliant Data) then sold out for $10.4 million, which was used as capital to start Wolfpack Studios. Of course, if you never really gave a shit about Shadowbane in the first place, you might actually FIND THAT SHIT OUT before asking inane questions. <img src="http://www.kaaos.com/htdocs/dcforum/Images/tongue.gif"><P>2. I meant the Shadowbane 'lore' stories. And that was among the most emphatic displays of general apathy I've ever read. Congratulations. No one said you had to read the story, jackass, but you could spend less time and energy raving about how you just don't give a fuck.<P>3. There's plenty up in the air about Shadowbane. Hell, I've got an (unfinished) column series about how much we DON'T know, just to keep gimps like you off my back.<P>4. It was still a cool story.

a) I wasn't aiming that at you J.  I've seen you digging for real information and I appreciate the effort.  I was aiming that at Wolfpack for using the delaying tactics of sending us a bunch of "backstory bullshit" instead of real information.<P>b) I think its sad that nobody has the balls to call BULLSHIT to Wolfpack for providing us with no more than useless fiction and I think its SADDER that the news sites are so desperate for hits that they would actually prop this "hot discussion" up as news.  Take, for example, the hot exclusive interview:<P>Vosx: Hey man - this Game of Thrones book by George R. Martin that I bought Sat night is awesome!....<BR>Ashen Temper: Good! I am actually finishing up the trilogy by C.S. Friedman...<BR>Vosx: This one is also three books. Ive been wanting to get it for a year or....<BR>Ashen Temper: Sweet, I'll go by Barnes & Nobles today and grab them...<BR>Vosx: Did you ever read the Tad williams series?<BR>Ashen Temper: The Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn one... didn't read his SciFi one, though<P>WoW!  Man, that is mind numbingly intense journalism.  I am stunned that Vosx was able to pry such informative bits of information from Wolfpack...            Jesus Christ on a Stick!<P>c) Info about their previous exploits are not readily available on your news site or any other, to my knowledge.  At leastt that I can find AND I don't think its an inane question... certainly its a better question that how do you misspell "Zaeristan, Zerystan, and others..."  When I went to E3 (on my own buck) and interviewed Wolfpack they told me they thought the idea up whilst drinking beer in college... <P>(That's when Marduk started asking if I wanted to put up a rant site under the Crossroads banner-ads.  I told him I didn't want to feel forced to come up with ass-kiss-content or be unable to rip Crossroads a new ass when the mood strikes me)    <BR> <BR>d) Not reading the backstory stuff makes me an inane, apathetic, jackass eh?... ROFL.  How's this?  I think your unfinished column about how much we don't know is one of the greatest displays of general apathy I've ever seen... so nya nya ::chuckle::  STFU<P>e) "It was still a cool story. Before you read it, have a beer."  Maybe I will.  Maybe I did but think its bullshit.  Then again... maybe I wont.  You asked if I was reading the stuff... I told you it's bullshit.  You got pissy.  Examine your reasons for getting so defensive, then give me a reason to read CrossVault of ShadowStratics.  <P>Lets put it this way... if you were looking for the mechanics of how an upcoming Ferrari engine worked... would you want to see discussions of Italian Literature on Car & Driver's web page?? <P>f) "kthxbuhbye"  Yeah.  Fuck you too.<P>~f

Div was in a quick meeting with Ashen and Warden and tried again and again to get them to answer questions.  He was lucky enough to get them to answer a few, but with all the other journalists babbling about crap no one cared about, Ashen and Warden got sidetracked (evaded the questions) and rarely took notice to answer.<P>He told me how difficult it was to get heard in there.  It really shows how much journalism a lot are actually trying to get into and how much some are just trying to be big shots and shoot the shit with the WP "bigwigs."  <P>A few more facts thrown out now and then wouldn't hurt WolfPack at all and even if they threw something out that they changed all they would have to say is "We changed it."  Not too hard really.<P>I actually haven't brought myself to read the whole story about a sword called shadowbane.  Frankly.. I think I've read too many stories with named swords to get excited honestly.  <P>Hell, Terror and most can tell you.. I'm an rper.. and all I'm trying to do is kill time until I can get in and kill others instead.  But without something more than some fancy stories to build on.. what's to talk about?  "Vapor guilds" "Flame fests"  "gossip" ;&gt;  Ok.. I like the gossip.  But I'm really reaching for some entertainment here. ;x<P>Sachant<BR>Mistress of Souls<BR>Knight of the Undead Lords<BR><a href="http://www.undeadlords.net" target="_blank">http://www.undeadlords.net</a>

Heh, that's much more copacetic of you. If you weren't aiming at me, I won't aim back. Fair? ;P<P>1. Shadowbane's still in beta, and combat mechanics are among the biggest kept secrets covered under NDA, for a reason. The fact that SB's concept is supposed to blow so many minds, but we don't know how, doesn't matter in the face of that. They haven't got the shit done, minute stuff is still changing, and besides, try explaining the game mechanics of an unfinished game to someone who hasn't played it.<P>2. Their previous exploits aren't on XRG yet, but they are on <a href="http://sb.drtwister.com/interviews/bg-wolfpack.shtml" target="_blank">here.</a> The founders probably did drink a lot of beer, but they were amassing about a half-century of MUD development experience between them. I just haven't done as much work on a FAQ as some of the other XRG sites.<P>3. Not reading the story doesn't make you a jackass, but not reading the story and writing a novel about how you hadn't read it and don't care about reading it, in response to a one-line query about who /was/ reading it, crosses the line into jackassdom. Most people just say "no" when they mean "no." <img src="http://www.kaaos.com/htdocs/dcforum/Images/tongue.gif"><P>4. Wolfpack intends to make the game story an integral part of the game, which to me is as feasible as making PvP integral to the game. That's not the reason to read the story, though; it's just a good story. But you may disagree.<P>5. Most people don't really give a fuck whether anyone at Wolfpack has any business experience. It doesn't get asked very often.<P>Lately, yeah, not getting ANYTHING from Wolfpack is putting a little strain on the fansites who were expecting a sustained stream of new material, like we were getting a year ago. That shouldn't be an excuse, but when the only people who can answer the questions consistently refuse to answer them, there's not much more I can tell you.<P>However, if I were a German fansite, I'd probably get tons and tons and TONS AND TONS of material, like <a href="http://www.gamesurf.de/index.php?id=419" target="_blank">this site just did</a>.<P>J.<BR>damned vulpine<BR><a href="http://sb.xrgaming.net/" target="_blank">http://sb.xrgaming.net/</a>

Well don't get too excited about lengthy messages from me.  As a Competitive Analyst (my profession) guy and "migrations coordinator" for a 500+ man guild I look at things in pretty deep space and it takes a lot of words to explain them... 99% of the time I lurke... 1% of the time I write novels about my wild ideas.<P>"Most people don't really give a fuck whether anyone at Wolfpack has any business experience. It doesn't get asked very often."<P>That very well may be the case.  I'd bet you my beta pass that GODgames is banking on that too.  Bikini Clad babe's are probably aimed at the 13 year old crowd and not the MBA's in the audience.<P>However, I personally think it's one of the most important questions someone could ask.  Having run a company right out of college and basing the majority of my fund raising efforts on "he's a wiz-kid" hype may have been effective at the time... but now days (after recovering from the financial results and guilt of possibly squandering squandering a lot of someone else's dollars) I think... "What moron invests in a CEO who has never done this shit before?"  (note: Steve Case was a Soap Salesman, lets remember)<P>First of all, look at how many people say that they are going to make the coolest game ever... and then end up folding.  Illusia, Varago, LoA, etc etc... there is no shortage of big promises which are not backed up by real money.  It happens every time some idiot with a CS degree says "Me and my buddy can do better than THIS... lets make our own game".<P>I like the guys from Wolfpack and enjoyed talking to them.  In fact, I was inspired by their grasp of what a game "could be"... ala the kinda shit Hedron yammers about and everyone else who have hung on to this genre for 10+ years dreams of despite its obvious and repeated demonstrations of cluelessness.<P>But if they negotiate a shitty distribution agreement... if they fuck-up payroll... if they take financial risks... if they don't pay their accountant... if they don't know how to drive a product to market... or if they bend over for some investor or media group to try to get something the "easy way" they are not going to be viable.<P>So what?  Other than the obvious early death sentence, so what?  Well, for example, a financially un-viable company with big ideas... but lawyers on their ass about some small fuck-up when they started out... is going to piss their money away on things OTHER than making the game work real well.  Their founders are going to be squandering their precious brains on trying to solve that distribution fuck-up or fix the oopses they made with the UPC number format or hold off on the contractually required special addition for CompUSA.  They might piss away their resources on free T-shirt give-always rather than get a decent 401k for their employees or blow the money on a "company car" so they can get to work.  They might infringe on someone's copyright crap and not have the legal (financial) capability to hold off the Barbarians at the Gate... and their corner cutting and bootstrapping is going to impact US, the gaming public.<P>Out of money, time, resources, bandwidth, competitive intelligence, or industry contacts?  Lets trim the Tech Support group... lets push the dates out on our delivery milestones... lets nerf worldbuilding and test so that we can ship on time... or hey, how about this one?  lets bend over for Swing!'s investment and distribution channel and they will buy us a server... all we have to do is let 50 of their people play around in our alpha... in fact, we'll tell everyone its a BETA and then tell everyone we hit a milestone! <P>Am I going to recomend that 500 members of my guild cancel their accounts and throw away all those years of asset gathering in EQ or UO so they can start over in Vaporbane?  Not until I see some details... quite simply put, I don't have the mentle BandWidth to read about Mythological UberWeapons.  I'm trying to sort the wheat from the chaff and figure out what the REAL DEAL is on Shadowbane... and the signal to noise ratio is the shits right now. <P>So lets look at what's happening... Wolfpack's running out of ideas for keeping the rabid fan-base interested... They are obviously way off schedule for the Marketing Plan (assuming Todd, the database consultant with Dun & Bradstreet, made one in the first place)... they can't trade on their "info dump" any longer because people demand to know what the hell is the meaning of all the info they dumped... They can't defer attention on the 20 "well known guilds" on their world map because all those guilds say "Hell, we don't know what Shadowbane is going to be like either"... They announced "beta" but it turns out everyone has a Swing! or GODgames employee badge and nobody's talkin... so they get their lone Story Board guy to write up 30 or 40 paragraphs of fiction (see anyone's RP section for thousands of examples of similar content) and drip that out to the info addicts in hopes that it will keep them from freaking out.  THEN they "leak" that they read books (wow) and so should you if you want to play to crush.<P>Sure beats the shit out of Coloring Contests for the kiddies... but some of us have a nose for the more sinister.  I've got 10 to 1 that they are in need of some strong Product Management skills... and I wonder if anyone on staff at Wolfpack has ever had the job of setting the priorities for a real company under even slightly similar conditions.... maybe they have... I don't know... but at least its reasonable to ask who I am putting my faith into... wouldn't you agree?<P>Rant off.  I'll go back to Lurking<P>~f

1. Meridian isn't the only one on the Story Board, he's just the only Staff Writer (and he's the only one who's won a P&P RPG industry award for his work at Chaosium doing the Call of Cthulhu series.) Warden, Varios, Scorn, Arcane and Naarsin are also on the board (and maybe more, I forget.) <P>2. You're still stuck in "fiction is meaningless" mode. Shadowbane plans to hire people as "feature characters" that will help direct the plot at one level or another. All the guild types, races, classes and disciplines are meant to reflect the story of a living world as much as to facilitate guild-on-guild warfare. It's supposed to matter.<P>3. The beta testers are half Americans and half Germans. Warden admitted to Erik the Red (as reported on SBVault) that quite a few of the testers are friends of theirs, but not all of them are.<P>4. Wolfpack has been notoriously late on their deadlines. Name me another game company that hasn't been. OSI shoved UO out the door. Blizzard held Diablo 2 back a whole year.<P>5. Wolfpack Studios has a total of 17 employees. The founders ran a company through three rounds of venture capital, business contracts and general profitability. They're working in the game industry, which is immensely imitative and in-bred, yet they've managed to get a buzz without spending a dime on marketing. The coloring contests are strictly fansite nonsense (and not MY fansite, mind you.)<P>6. Warden drives an SUV. Tacitus, one of the feature programmers, drives the same car he had when he moved to Austin from Kansas City, and apologized for the leaky back window when he drove me to 6th Street last November. To my knowledge, they have no company cars.<P>7. The guild names on the map were just ... guild names on a map. There's no big secret there.<P>8. You really need to count to 10 and calm the fuck down. :) You are one of several thousand people who want the same kinds of things from Shadowbane. Any guild that quits a game in favor of an unfinished game must either really hate the game it had been playing, or its members are really delusional.<P>The last beta tester for Shadowbane who "outed" himself to a friend got deluged with 50 e-mails in the span of 15 minutes, and probably will receive more. Small wonder no one wants anyone to know who they are.<P>Shadowbane will be, what it will be. That's all there is to say about it.<P>J.<BR>damned vulpine<BR><a href="http://sb.xrgaming.net/" target="_blank">http://sb.xrgaming.net/</a>

While alot of what you're saying is intelligent questioning of the unknown, and worth thinking about, you're pushing it too hard.  I've thought about and/or asked some of those same questions myself.  But there are a few of reasons it's not getting under my skin as much as it is for you.  Some of these things have been touched on in your exchange with J already and some haven't, but I thought I'd spotlight them a little.<P>Most of this all fits into the category, "you're skinning the wrong cat."<P>1) It's definitely a smart thing to wonder about the skill set of any start-up company in terms of what amount of acumen and business experience they have.  It's this analysis that allows us to decide how much faith we will put in their ability to produce results.  HOWEVER, why the fuck you'd be pissy about WP on this issue is beyond me.  They have proven to the people they needed to prove things to that they have what it takes.  Namely the investors.<P>Have they launched a PR campaign to inform the game fans of their experience base?  No.  Not really.  But if I were them I wouldn't waste any time on that either.  Why the fuck should I?  The fans for the most part love my game concept, the money men already committed, etc. etc.  Any time spent trying to educate the public to achieve goals that have already been achieved is a waste of bandwidth.  In the meantime, they did provide some of this info via interviews and such.  That's plenty.  Would YOU spend time on it if you rant that business Faust?  If you did, I'd question your judgement.<P>2)  On the game mechanics information there are two major blind spots - big fat ones - in what we know about the game.<P>a) Broad conceptual outlines of how they will deal with the various community, mechanical and social challenges of PIGs.  They have repeatedly indicated that they don't want to share these due to the competitive landscape.  You may agree or disagree with that stand, you may think it smells fishy, but it is what it is.  It's not a WHOLLY unreasonable point of view, and I don't really blame them for it.<P>b) Very specific mechanical information that would indicate how that actual game will come together and what the smart moves will be.  I personally consider any attempt to convey this information to be pissing in the wind.  You can't provide some fat list of tables and values and expect most people to assemble that into any real notion of how playability will be.  And on top of that to release those things when they'll only change drastically seems like a treadmill type of task that will have to be done over and over again as they're tweaked until not even the statisticians care.<P>I fully agree that the above two blind spots are the only thing a smart gamer gives a fuck about at this point.  But I also am fairly comfortable with WHY they're blind spots.<P>3) Yes, the recent releases of what cool books to read are not helpful in evaluating the game.  Who gives a fuck?  It's not like they're mounting an advertising effort on it.  The bottom line is that SB has created a fairly friendly atmosphere with their fan sites, and often they just shoot the shit with them.<P>If you combine this with a lack of hard news... you get news updates just like that one.  Who cares?  It's background noise.  It's kind of unimpressive on the front page of the news site, but I wouldn't be annoyed at WP for making the comments, I'd be annoyed with the news sites for treating it like news.  And even then, WHO CARES?  If it' that or a blank page, what's the difference?<P>4)  On the release of the RP background story.  Nope, I haven't read it.  Nope, I really don't care much about it one way or the other UNTIL it starts to become relevant through the game.  But lots of people live for that stuff, and they're catering to that part of the audience.  Once again, who fucking cares if they release it?<P>The bottom line is that<P>A) You're pissed at WP for not releasing more hard info.  But I personally just don't find that lack of info to be unexpected or unreasonable.<P>B) You're pissed at WP for releasing "fluff".  But I don't have a problem with them releasing fluff as long as it doesn't impede development.  AND, I think on blind spot (a) they're making a strategic decision and on blind spot (b) they'd be pissing up a rope to try it.<P>REALLY what I think you're pissed at is the rabid fans for being rabid rather than being reasonably optimistic and interested but intellectually independent.  But did you really expect people to be otherwise?  Welcome to the bell curve.<P>Other than that, I think you just like being pissy and you enjoy the drama of strong position statements.  It sells better in the consulting biz, doesn't it now?  (smile)<P>HOWEVER, I nonetheless find your frothing rants to be hilarious and to bring into relief some issues that while WP probably shouldn't/won't do much to resolve them, perhaps a rabid fan would do well to think about.<P>Hedron<BR><a href="http://www.kaaos.com/hedron/falseprophet.htm" target="_blank">The False Prophet</a><BR><a href="http://www.kaaos.com" target="_blank">KAAOS</a><P>...No child, don't cry.

Man, that is mind numbingly intense journalism. I am stunned that Vosx was able to pry such informative bits of information from Wolfpack... Jesus Christ on a Stick!"<BR>===============================<P>That was a private icq conversation from 5 months ago with my friend that had something to do with a similar topic, and was nothing more than toungue and cheek. And before you start harping on gaming journalism - why don't you follow a damn game for 24 friggin 7  for over year, praying to get a crumb of useful information so you can justify keeping your job and giving your people something they want.<P>As it so happens, I have had many conversations about pvp, attack times, damage ratios, weapon speed vs armor numbers, theories of how pvp is supposed to work, what the hell happens during a seige, and how you actually build a damn city and what it takes - but you know, I can't tell people  like you, because when WP finds out you know this - then Im out of the loop and become the Pets.com for Shadowbane fan sites who panhandles for extra rumors to print, and spare change from J and other sites.<P>blah. Do you have something of a point with this post? - yeah. Will I act like the community tattle and 'be hard' on Wolfpack so I can please fellow frustrated fans and try to get some imaginary 'respektz' from readers while becoming the Pariah thats out of the info loop? Hell, no.<P>Who the hell cares if fans are rabid and don't know what they are getting. They know they are going to a titty bar - no we don't know if the chicks look good, or if the beer costs 10$ a bottle, or if they play country music and theres absolutely no touching allowed. WE DON"T CARE! When you been in freaking gaming prison for three years and get the chance to see some flesh - then whos going to nitpick and bitch about knowing the cover charge to the place or "are the bathrooms clean??" ARE YOU ONE OF THESE PPL??<P>STFU and wait til the next morning to bitch or get the hell out of my car. Theres always some idiot bringing me down and killing my Buzz - why arent you on the Lum boards anyway so you can hang around with the hate Shadowbane first crowd and do little sayonces to Diku MUD and pray for the golden era of MMORPG's to come back like 'Gemstone 3'?<P>Ive been on the phones and on the email trying to get them to release the info I want - the transcripts I want - but I don't get what I want all the time. And when they say "No" I don't try and use my site to get back at them. Sometimes you win - sometimes you lose. Sometimes Im covering Monica Lewinsky's white spotted dress - sometimes Im covering the damn county fair parade with Ms. Dirt Road#12.<P>It comes with the territory. Is the news worth it to you when I write it? Probably not, but I do it anyway. Will you come to SBV for hard core take no prisoners news coverage of Shadowbane - no. Thats not my MO, nor my inclination anyway. Then again, Ive been allowed a great deal of access and have been their guests in Roundrock and see the cool shit and I 'know' the difference between Wild Turkey and Chivas. It sucks to have to take my word for it - but there it is.<P>**damn Hedron, should tell someone your making threads public so certain imbeciles named Vosx can wait and make asses of themselves when less ppl are looking.

The jist of the news story (the way I read it) is "I'm hip I was already yammering with Ashen about this stuff months ago"... I tune into your site about 15 times a day and this kinda stuff makes me groan.  Will I keep checking your site?  Yes, once in a while you guys get real news... but I sure as hell am not clicking on your banner ads (if you get my drift).<P>Am I one of the guys that shoots down Shadowbane at every opportunity?  No.  I've been supporting it.  Maybe not supporting it by flying into a chat room every time a WP employee enters for the express purpose of blowing smoke up their ass, but I've been supporting it.<P>"why don't you follow a damn game for 24 friggin 7 for over year, praying to get a crumb of useful information so you can justify keeping your job and giving your people something they want."<P>I've been doing exactly that (you have no idea how I've been doing exactly that).  And not just for Shadowbane...  I can't say I do it to keep a job... I decided long ago that this shit is a HOBBY and here's why...<P>Kissing ass to developers that screw up so that I can remain the favorite boy is demeaning and does not further the hopes and dreams of hard core online gamers that DESERVE a decent game.  C'mon!  The technology is here, the bandwidth is here, there are surely people who know what a good design would look like... but these guys (MMORPG developers in general, not WolfPack) are catering to the lowest comon denominator of game savvy and playing AOL to the masses.   Sucking their press package information for "news" doesn't challenge the developers to create things that are worthy of our time.  <P>1. UO is/was full of bugs and half assed spagetti code... some sites ignored it as if things were just hunkie dorie because they wanted Designer Dragons to cuddle with them. Then Garriot gets shafted and the whole Daisy chain of reach-around GM butt buddies collapses in a giant heap... And pets.com had more informative stories about the FAULTS of UO than most of the fan sites, and I'm not just throwing Snowballs here. <P>2. EQ's original engine design HAD to be a 6 person LAN based game, their PvP is a complete nightmare, and they spent about 30 second understanding what an "Online Guild" actually does for an online game... I could go on for hours and hours about their foibles...  Result?  Very few sites will make mention of the ugly but REAL facts and spend all their time singing Happy Happy Joy Joy so that Verant will throw them a bone once in a while.  ONLINE WEDDING ON TAREW MARR!!! BE THERE!!  I don't read the mainline EQ fan sites any more... just the specific ones.  Signal to noise ratio again.<P>Lets get to the real issue... I'm scared as hell of Shadowbane.  Why?  Because it SOUNDS perfect.  I've even talked to Arcane personally on several occasions trying to punch holes in their design... I can't.  It SOUNDS insanely awesome.<P>However, just like Suzy256 in an AOL Chat Room 99% of the most beautiful thing you've ever seen is created in your imagination.  Is Shadowbane perfect?  Or am I filling in the blanks with my IDEA of perfection?  And just like Suzy256... I wanna see, touch, and fondle things before I believe.  I don't fall in love with things on the Internet.  In other words, I've met Suzy256.... and although Bob would provide a world class case study in wierdness... he isn't exactly what was advertized.  Your telling me that you want to keep promoting Suzy256 because she cybers you in private rooms and you like it... Suzy256 wont cyber you if you tell anyone HOW she cybers you... but you get to come here and tell us that your geting a constant amount of cyber while we're out in the cold.  <P>And your not soothing my fears.  Your making them worse by telling me you're corporate salute to Wolfpack starts out by getting on your knees.<P>~f<P>(Let me spell this one out for the unenlightened... Suzy256 is an analogy for the many game's that sound perfect but end up being not so perfect)

I don't <BR>&gt;read the mainline EQ fan <BR>&gt;sites any more... just the <BR>&gt;specific ones.<P>My experiences with EQ Fan sites: I used to go to two fan sites for EQ: EQVault and EQ Haven. Now, Haven was a nice place, but it had lots of problems getting cutting edge information and they weren't really writing up anything interesting either. It didn't take too long for Haven to finally collapse. <P>EQVault could have been so good. It had the cutting edge information, the developers visited the Vault boards a lot. It should have been good. But god damn it, they started posting weddings. Now this might be nice for a server specific site; however, on a fucking EQ information site I do not give a damn about who is getting married to who on some server I've never been on when I have no clue who these people are that are getting married and I doubt the poster knows either. Needless to say, it didn't take more than a couple wedding announcements to force me to stop visiting that site. They could have been the site with the inside track, but they blew it.<P> edit: Forgot to put up the moral of the story. For a fan site there is a fine line between too much information and too little. The best way to hit that fine line is by posting up quality information, and only quality information, along with putting up editorials. I don't want weddings, I don't want to know what books the people at WP read. I want to know what influences those books have on the people writing stories at wolfpack. I want to see a history of the work experience that each member of Wolfpack has, kinda like what J posted up. I'd like to know what other MMORPGS or games in general that they have played so that I know what influences will be on the game. More specifically I'd like to know what they think each game did right and wrong. I'd like to see you write an article on why it should be important to maintain diplomatic relationships in Shadowbane. When they give you info to post, I don't just want the same press release that everyone else gets, I want to see an analysis of it: the good, the bad, and the interesting. <P>If you can do that, then you've got another subscriber.<P><P>/edit<P>&gt;(Let me spell this one out <BR>&gt;for the unenlightened...

Don't know what games he's played, but he was the one to merge DikuMUD and CircleMUD code to form the codebase for ChaosMUD.<P>J. Todd "Warden" Coleman, VP of marketing for WP, producer and big-picture idea man for SB. Purports to have 15 years of MUD development experience, has played UO and EQ, didn't like either of them, though he understands why EQ was so popular, "it's a freakin' DikuMUD." His concepts for SB were partly borrowed from ChaosMUD, which he was a worldbuilder and wizard on, and influenced by Norse mythology and the Elric of Melnibone series by Michael Moorcock. After leaving his first crappy job, he got Arcane to build the alpha of DCSL, which he sold through Reliant Data, when he was its CTO.<P>Robert "Naarsin" Marsa. Has only appeared in two interviews, to my knowledge, so I don't know much about him, other than he has a PhD in physics from U of Texas-Austin, and looks like the white version of Chris Rock. CTO of Wolfpack, 'catch-all' programmer for Shadowbane, has his hand in everything. Was a programmer at Reliant Data, and would only come on board at Wolfpack if they were committed to a Mac version of Shadowbane. He only programs on Macs.<P>N. Patrick "Varios" Blanton, VP of product design for WP and lead designer for SB. He sees his role as designer as breaking down Warden & Co.'s large concepts into whatever cannot be broken. Was notoriously good at locating bugs in MUDs he was playing and working on. Has known Warden since middle school. Played UO early on, quit early, notorious powergamer who "plays to win," but would rather Shadowbane not be a PK's paradise.<P>Jeff "Ashton Kai" Toney, 3D artist, did most of the early building models, heavily influenced by Middle Eastern architecture and culture, did most of the Irekei stuff. Former t-shirt designer who was working on a game called Shadowpact when he met the founding members of Wolfpack; Shadowpact's development studio shut down before the game shipped, and he jumped ship to Wolfpack. The world's nicest man in person, with some very dark interests, he's impossible to annoy and easy to amuse.<P>Billy "Hezrael" Arnold, 3D artist, did most of the character models and clothes, especially the early stuff. Worked for several published titles, mostly console stuff. Reportedly yanked Derek "Windfeather" Sanderson, UO2 designer, out by the collar when he entered Wolfpack's trailer at E3 to get a peek at their demo. Do not piss this man off; I know by experience.<P>Everett "Belthior" Lee, character animator. Old-school UO player who keeps his former identity guarded, but from what I know, he hung with the hard-core, RP and PK, most of which probably didn't know he was doing both at the time. One of the most obnoxious players Warden's ever known -- one of the primary design imperatives for SB has been to make it "Varios- and Belthior-proof."<P>Toby "Tacitus" Ford, feature programmer, did many of the area effects and is reportedly working on the Shadowbane Player, the thingy that records in-game action. Hired straight out of U of Missouri-Kansas City, he impressed Naarsin with his posts to an apple.com mailing list for OpenGL programmers, and had a Tekken clone for MacOS half-finished when he joined Wolfpack.<P>Sean "Ashen Temper" Dahlberg, internet relations manager. Marine Corps sergeant who landed a job developing and supporting commercial Web sites on contract at a SoCal outfit, procured the earliest versions of the "shared dev board" message sites for Shadowbane, recruited to run Shadowvault, which later hooked up with IGN. Very prominent in both UO and EQ, playing evil female characters (LdyDeath on Pacific, <a href="http://express.stratics.com/credits/kallystra.htm" target="_blank">Kallystra</a> on Rallos Zek.)<P>James "Scorn" Nance, content director. Worked on ChaosMUD with Arcane, Warden and Varios, was an investor for Reliant Data and Wolfpack before they hired him full-time. Has a strong IT background of which I'm fuzzy, though he was also one of the founders of bike.com, which was recently featured on fuckedcompany.com. Apparently knows how to dodge bullets pretty well.<P>Thomas K.A. "Dreadflame" Sitch, feature programmer, scary individual. Never played a MMOG and never worked on a commercial computer game before working at Wolfpack, his previous job was at the Institute for Brain Dementia at U of California at Irvine, where he programmed models for Alzheimer's research. Ran the Web site for the local Camarilla LARP group out of Orange County, called The Black Magic Kingdom, was picked out of a crowd at E3 and introduced to Wolfpack.<P>Tre "Soulphage" Zieman, 3D artist. Previous job was at Acclaim's Austin office, where he did models for the Turok and Quarterback Club series, now is in charge of all the swamp stuff in Shadowbane, among other things.<P>Sam "Meridian" Johnson, staff writer. Has known Warden and Varios since middle school, won at least one industry award for his gameplay modules for the Chaosium series, Call of Cthulhu. Has written out just about everything of length on classes, races, disciplines and legends in Shadowbane. Shadowbania.com launched with a great interview with him yesterday. Sings baritone with the U. of Texas Madrigal Dinner Singers.<P>Kevin "Eiss" Saunders, feature programmer. Hired straight out of Utah State U., where he programmed robots for experimental AI movement. Guess what he's doing for Shadowbane?<P>Keith "Zyzebo" Brewer, "online rollout director," according to the beta press release, though he was hired as a contract database consultant. Worked with Arcane, Warden and Naarsin at Reliant Data, is a member of Brotherhood of Crimson Knights (www.bck.org). And no, he hasn't told them anything, to their consternation. I already asked.<P>Chuck “Arjuna” Fleming and Scott “Lazslo” Wietterschneider, programmer and 3D artist, respectively, of which I know very very little, except Lazslo did the Bearkin monster model, and used to work for EA.<P>Any more questions? :)<P>J.<BR>damned vulpine<BR><a href="http://sb.xrgaming.net/" target="_blank">http://sb.xrgaming.net/</a>

I think there is a light at the end of the tunnel if WP does things right.  They could self publish for one, get as many units as possible on the shelves across america, and also have a free download.  Money from MMORPGs is racked up in the monthly income intake, and they'd do best to be garnering all this money themselves rather than taking royalties from it through some publisher whom from the sounds of that article would screw them over.

Bah.  After reading that article, it sure lends publishers in a bad light.  Why not skip them?

Get as much box copies on the shelves as possible for those modem boys at a decent price.<P>2. Have a download for the game.  Free.

A lot. <img src="http://www.kaaos.com/htdocs/dcforum/Images/tongue.gif"><P>or<P>Maybe have a publisher do the box sets.... but, then wouldn't Wolfpack only get royalties off monthly payment from users of box sets?  I suppose this would be okay... just so long as there was a different initialization code for a downloaded copy and a box set.  To distinguish between the two, so the publisher doesn't get royalties off any account created from a downloaded copy of the game.<P>Anyway I'm babbling, but I hope Sb dumped take two and is going to self publish.  <P>Look how popular counter-strike was before it was ever an official Half life mod sold over the counter.
