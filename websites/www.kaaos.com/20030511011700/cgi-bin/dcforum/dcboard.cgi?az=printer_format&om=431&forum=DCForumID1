<blockquote>I see a long line of why you won't fight us.  Cowards? Fucking cowards.<P>Don't give me a dictation on how we're not worth your time, etc, etc.  Don't cry to me about how I'm a child and you're better than me.  Don't attempt to stray from the facts by calling us gimps and acting for half of a second like warring you would give us some fame.  KAAOS is a PvP joke.  You all know this.<P>You played a blue EQ server, yes?  I could be mistaken, it's late and my memory isn't serving me correctly.   Bah, either way, one of your members speaks of how PvP at the 45  range is the best.<P>I recall that type on Tallon.  "Wait, I'm leveling, I'll fight later!!"  Guess what?  They never fought.  They leveled to 50, got their #####items, and now sit around in large guilds claiming dominance, but not a damn one of them lifted a finger in PvP combat along the way.<P>This is what KAAOS will be.<P>If I'm not mistaken a fully unbuffed Fangol of TCE destroyed a buffed member of KAAOS not too long ago in a duel.  Why?  Because he has PvP'd (Even at the lower levels), while the lad he fought was busy leveling to "fight later". <P>Truth is after 45 it is very difficult to die in PvP unless you suck.  Thats it, isn't it?  You will enjoy PvP after 45 because you won't have to die as often and then you can't be beaten, thus you can maintain your reputation as the premeire killing guild?  Afterall, you'll be hunting lowbies that are enjoying the PvP server for all it's worth, those with ten times more skill than yourselves in PvP, but deficient in a world where levels and items dictate true strength.<P>Those from Tallon, and Vallon will tell you that the best PvP, the greatest wars, the truest test of skill comes around 20-30.  Only at this level does any semblance of skill dictate success, as after this point it is purely items that dictate strength, and prior to this point everyone is too weak to make things interesting.<P>Boy, you'll sure teach those level 10's a big lesson guys!!<P>So, all name calling aside, all backpeddling and cowards guised in the form of mockery of TCE in the past, will you flee like a pack of injured pups when we declare war on you?<P>Admittedly, when you war us your entire existance on Sullon will become that war.  We'll hunt you like deer with every last effort, we'll rape you at your spawn point, we'll make it a habit to train you into oblivion.  That is war.  It's not nice, it's war.<P>Tell me you'll accept our challenge, or else you shall remain forever a coward guild.  You will flee us in Shadowbane just as you flee us now, then race to your forums to spout how we aren't worth your time and declare that you seek a better foe.  Truth being, you'll never have a worthwhile foe unless it bears the semblance of a 7 year old child carrying a lolipop that you can gank from behind.<P>War, or STFU.  You have proven nothing to anyone, and you whimper before a threat.  If we are so easily beaten, do so until we retreat.  <P>Let us test the strength of your quest to the top, and see how it compares to some of the PvP and EQ war experienced minds of the empire.<P>  </blockquote><hr><b><font size=2>Table of contents</font></b><hr>

Well, I played on tallon as Adiassy in the guild Circle Noir, if you've heard of it, and I must say that level 20-30 pvp was pretty shitty. Not that level 45  pvp wasn't, but it made 20-30 pvp look like tic tac toe. That is all.

ROFL.  Unless when we were playing RZ, and it was turned blue, you are wrong.  Um, go read the polls on most major sites, KAAOS is the top guild.  And, if your member beat a KAAOSer, he was mistaken, as you are.  KAAOS left RZ LONG LONG ago, and, as a whole, pretty much left EQ until SZ came out recently.  Give me an idea why a KAAOSer would come to save any of your sorry asses?  Or even fight?  Ya see, its like the food chain, and we have evolved to be the top predator.  You are somewhere along the lines of a dung beetle.  <P><BR>Hugs and Kisses,<P>Ku<BR>KAAOS

Fucking cowards. <P><BR>Not being an EQer(all the happy pastel colors disgust me), I don't know the rules of this new server. However, it seems to me that if you actually want KAAOS to fight you, then you should attack KAAOS rather than staying away from KAAOS and calling them pussies for not attacking you.<P>If you want someone's attention you don't whine endlessly on their boards, you go up to them and smack them around. Will KAAOS continue to ignore your pathetic existence if you actually kill some of their members? I think not.<P>Just ask Darkenbane, they attacked KAAOS. They were attacked back heavily. Even with all the lies that Darkenbane spews, they never claimed that KAAOS was unwilling to fight.<P>If game mechanics don't allow you to attack them, then train them instead. You can do that to everyone.<P>&gt;You played a blue EQ server, <BR>&gt;yes?<P>KAAOS has played on 3 different PvP servers: the original one, the coin loot only teams server, and finally Sullon Zek.<P><BR>&gt;<BR>&gt;I recall that type on Tallon. <BR>&gt; "Wait, I'm leveling, I'll <BR>&gt;fight later!!"  Guess what? <BR>&gt; They never fought.  <BR>&gt;They leveled to 50, got <BR>&gt;their #####items, and now sit <BR>&gt;around in large guilds claiming <BR>&gt;dominance, but not a damn <BR>&gt;one of them lifted a <BR>&gt;finger in PvP combat along <BR>&gt;the way. <P>Did you ever attack that person? Or did you just sit around like his little bitch as he claims his dominance over you?<P>&gt;Because he has PvP'd (Even <BR>&gt;at the lower levels), while <BR>&gt;the lad he fought was <BR>&gt;busy leveling to "fight later". <BR>&gt;<P>Sure, experience counts. KAAOS already has that from the other PvP servers. From that experience KAAOS knows that levels and equipment are both important in EQ. They don't want to be fighting losing battles. They're smarter than that.<P>&gt;<BR>&gt;Truth is after 45 it is <BR>&gt;very difficult to die in <BR>&gt;PvP unless you suck.  <BR>&gt;Thats it, isn't it?  <BR>&gt;You will enjoy PvP after <BR>&gt;45 because you won't have <BR>&gt;to die as often and <BR>&gt;then you can't be beaten, <BR>&gt;thus you can maintain your <BR>&gt;reputation as the premeire killing <BR>&gt;guild?

You call them pussies for taking the intelligent path. That would reinforce the theory (can we call it a Law yet?) that TCE is a group of idiots who don't understand the game that they are playing or are unwilling to do what it takes to win within the bounds of the game(ie no hacking).<P>&gt;Those from Tallon, and Vallon will <BR>&gt;tell you that the best <BR>&gt;PvP, the greatest wars, the <BR>&gt;truest test of skill comes <BR>&gt;around 20-30.  Only at <BR>&gt;this level does any semblance <BR>&gt;of skill dictate success, as <BR>&gt;after this point it is <BR>&gt;purely items that dictate strength, <BR>&gt;and prior to this point <BR>&gt;everyone is too weak to <BR>&gt;make things interesting. <BR>&gt;<P>At 20-30 you have people who are 40-50. So while you're at 20-30, you will be getting completely destroyed by people with pure items and levels. What's so great about that? Instead, KAAOS has opted to be 40-50 where they will have the items to combat all the other 40-50s with the items. That way they get good fair combat. Which is where the true test of skill is.<P><BR>&gt;So, all name calling aside, all <BR>&gt;backpeddling and cowards guised in <BR>&gt;the form of mockery of <BR>&gt;TCE in the past, will <BR>&gt;you flee like a pack <BR>&gt;of injured pups when we <BR>&gt;declare war on you? <P>How about you quit declaring and start attacking? You can hide behind your own declarations all you want, and the rest of the morons will believe that you actually want war. However, until you start attacking you are a never is, a never was, and a never will be.<P>&gt;Admittedly, when you war us your <BR>&gt;entire existance on Sullon will <BR>&gt;become that war.  We'll <BR>&gt;hunt you like deer with <BR>&gt;every last effort, we'll rape <BR>&gt;you at your spawn point, <BR>&gt;we'll make it a habit <BR>&gt;to train you into oblivion. <BR>&gt; That is war.  <BR>&gt;It's not nice, it's war. <P>Expect the same when you actually start to attack.<P><BR>&gt;You will flee us in <BR>&gt;Shadowbane just as you flee <BR>&gt;us now, then race to <BR>&gt;your forums to spout how <BR>&gt;we aren't worth your time <BR>&gt;and declare that you seek <BR>&gt;a better foe.

KAAOS chose the better strategy for EQ, you chose the admittedly weaker one. Do you think that will all change when you both hit Shadowbane? Somehow, I don't.<P><BR>Mortarion<BR><i>The god of death and decay</i>

My opinion of KAAOS has definitely gone up since that one night a few weeks ago. Apparently a good number of you are actively seeking PvP in the sub 50 lvls. Ive noticed Blayloc in the top 20 for a while now, nice work. The whole reason for my initial disgust with KAAOS was based soley on a passed up opportunity at PvP that was laid right at your feet. Granted, you may have seen it differently then I because you werent outside among the newts and I was.... for a while. Anyway, that Befallen incident is long over and done with, so no sense beating a dead horse. <P>Since then ive watched KAAOS and HoW (TCE) climb their way onto the boards. KAAOS's merger into the Sixth Circle alliance (Infernal Elite) has sent the combined scores pretty far up the boards. You guys simply have a completely different mind set going into this server than I do. You are there to dominate as much as humanly possible in a game that was never truly ment for PvP. Thats fine, if you want to dominate EQ be my guest, it seems be your guilds objective in any game you tackle. Me? Hell, im just there to get in some PvP action before SB comes out, screw domination =P. Of course im disappointed that you wouldnt accept the war, but the war only really suits my needs =). Obviously you have other plans in mind. <P>Anyway, thought Id stop by and send a shout out to Rann, who graciously kicked my ass in a duel the other day. It was a good duel, had fun... and it was close. Yep, I lost and Im a TCE'er! Oh well, maybe next time. Anyway, I AM true to my word you can ask Rann about that, any time, any place. Ill duel you. Im not here to dominate the goddamn game. I cant fucking stand EQ. I hate spending 12+ hours for each fukin lvl. I hate sitting in a room camping some POS peice of loot for another 10 hours. I dont even like the PvP "all" that much. Im playing to get to know my guild, and my competition better. Ive been on the score board for "Top 20 evils Yesterday" twice now I think, Yay.... <P>Anyway, nice to see the competition baring its fangs, hope to see you guys again... I want a rematch Rann *grin*. <P>-Rek<P>PS- Im still gonna kick your ass in SB =P.

<b><i>“The whole reason for my initial disgust with KAAOS was based soley on a passed up opportunity at PvP that was laid right at your feet. Granted, you may have seen it differently then I because you werent outside among the newts and I was.”</b></i><P>There are things that need to be done to be and stay competitive. You must remain focused and you must remain dedicated. That particular fight was in an entirely different zone with no KAAOSers involved. We don’t care about anybody but our own. If the Nuets were in our way we would have driven a stake through their hearts. As it was, a “fight” in West Commons did not affect us. This game is fraught with waste and you must recognize it and strive to minimize it. We will not deviate, we will not distract, from our agenda simply to run around chasing every newb in the game. There’s more to being a PvPer than throwing your balls at every swinging dick. If we distract simply to kill some no-name from some no-name guild every time we log on then our levels would be similar to those in your guild and the other PvP guilds will make it their agenda to shove our faces in a pile of shit of our own making. <BR>	<BR><b><i>“Since then ive watched KAAOS and HoW (TCE) climb their way onto the boards.”</b></i><P>We are still leveling, any score we’ve had to this point is from what I would gauge a 10% effort. This isn’t just in our case, this is the case of all the guilds that take PvP seriously. PvP is light right now from the top guilds compared to where it will be when we all finish taking care of business. In a few more weeks you will see the shit really hit the fan.<P><b><i>“You guys simply have a completely different mind set going into this server than I do. You are there to dominate as much as humanly possible in a game that was never truly ment for PvP. Thats fine, if you want to dominate EQ be my guest, it seems be your guilds objective in any game you tackle.”</b></i><P>That’s exactly right, it is our objective to dominate every game we tackle. Every move you make in every game reflects on your guild. A guild does not survive for 9 years by being a punching bag. If you think that means we like to pick on the weak then you still have a lot to learn. Any idiot can kill a lame duck. It means nothing to us. We look for the challenge and we rise to the occasion. Defeating an evenly matched foe time after time after time after year after year after year after game after game after game proves dominance.<P>Existing to pick on the helpless is not dominating, it’s for the weak, as is consistently “playing the underdog”. People who want to play the underdog need excuses for their inadequacies. A victory here or there is simply luck. It cannot be maintained over the long haul but that’s ok for those who like to play the underdog because they can always say “yea well you had more people / you had more levels / you had better gear....I did pretty good though didn’t I?”. No, you didn’t do pretty good, you are a piece of shit. Your job as a PvPer is to level the playing field and to destroy that level playing field time after time after time. No excuses for anybody, the field was leveled. You live and die by your own skill. You must look yourself in the face, you must take responsibility for your own ineptitude. The line must be drawn and you must hold that line. This is where the real PvPer roams, they roam this line. They own this line. They revel in their victories and they bleed with every defeat as they must realize that there is no place to point the finger except at themselves.<P>Every KAAOSer takes being a part of this guild seriously and this guild takes every game seriously. There are very few guilds like this but all true PvP guilds are the same in this regard. The majority of the guilds out there do not have the heart of a real PvP guild..<P><b><i>“Of course im disappointed that you wouldnt accept the war”</b></i><P>A war wouldn’t have proven anything. You would have been stung and stung hard. You had and have no chance for victory in a war with us. It wouldn’t have been a war, it would have been a slaughter. You can argue this all you like but the simple fact is, one of our pets could guildwar your entire guild and win. The highest level in your guild is still very green to me and I was gone for a week and am at the low end of the average levels in our guild. Where is the challenge in that for us? We take war very seriously. If we warred with you we would spend every waking moment making you bleed until there wasn’t a one of you left with the will to log in. In the mean time, every day we delay the real PvP guilds take a level advantage over us. A war with no risk? A war with no challenge? A war with no incentive so that our competitors can take an advantage over us and try to use that advantage to slap us around? I think even a retard would agree that that doesn’t make much sense. Once the xp break at level 52 is reached, and the ceiling is within reasonable range and level advantages are mitigated, then excursions can be taken. <P><b><i>“I cant fucking stand EQ. I hate spending 12+ hours for each fukin lvl. I hate sitting in a room camping some POS peice of loot for another 10 hours.” </b></i><P>You should not be spending 12+ hours for a level. It should take you no more than an average of 4 hours per level from 20 - 30. 30 - 40 an average of 7 hours per level (Hell Levels calculated in). 40 - 50 an average of 9 hours per level (Hell Levels calculated in). Some people can do it much faster, I find this to be a solid average considering distractions and reasonable play time per session. Some people take much longer because they don’t understand the game.   <P>As far as what you do with your time, spending 10 hours camping the same spawn, that’s something you are going to have to work out for yourself. Personally, I use the time to keep moving towards a set goal. The time seems to fly by much quicker and the levels come almost as a byproduct. <P>In anycase, it’s going to be more of the same in Shadowbane. We simply do not fuck around, we take things seriously, we learn the game quickly. We have the heart, desire, and drive to hit our goals. And our goals in every game is to be a dominant force. We have, and always will, stand the test of time. <P>Azmodion<BR>KAAOS

I agree with all that.<P>Simply put tho Az, I have not had the opportunity (until now) to experience play with my guild. For me its an old school PvPer in a new setting. I have the same basic mindset of any other person who's participated in a lot of PvP. Im not a whiner, you wont hear me complain about getting bitch slapped by a player 10 lvls over me, or ganked by a group of 6. PvP isn't about fair, I know that. If you are going to play with the big boys you have to take it all seriously, I know that as well. <P>However, I dont like EQ... ive already stated that. So why play? Because the better I know my team the better I am able to work with them and understand them. Even to a point fight with them better so I wont have to take the time to learn this in Shadowbane, a game I believe I DO want to play. <P>As for the time ratios you set for lvling I believe you are probably right. However, for all practical purposes I am an EQ newb. So naturally it takes me longer to figure out where to go and what to do to excel. You see, my situation is different from yours in that KAAOS as a whole has long term experience with all its members. Did you guys start out on top? Hell no. Did you all start out working perfectly together like a team of synchronized swimmers? Not likely. Im learning to play with my team, and yes if I ACTUALLY wanted to make my mark and not be seen as a total PvP/MMORPG newbie I would do everything in my power to be on top. <P>I played Napa Valley of UO for three years. I DID want to be known there and so I took every measure to do so. And I did quite well, I can tell you with little reservation that I was one of the best on the server. Of course that doesnt really matter now. <P>Anyway, back to square one. You're right, to be the best you must strive to do it in every environment you come to. But, you dont start out as the best. So I have to start somewhere, a fresh start with a new guild. And no matter how hard I try I dont have the desire to be the best in a game I dont like playing all that much. Its not a BAD game, its just "ok". You guys all know as well as I do that in most cases (until maybe very high lvls after much time invested) EQ takes very little "player skill" to excel in. As you have all said before its all about lvls and equipment. And you and I both know that that is kinda cutting the heart and soul out of PvP. I know your going to tell me that you have to do whatever it takes to win, but sometimes its just not very fun =). <P>Anyway, im lvl 26 now and steadily rising... Its not that im unwilling to sink the time in, im just unwilling to put in for the long haul. EQ just doesnt mesh well with me. Well, enough of my rambling, get back to your lvling *grin*<P>-Rek

*Edit*<P>I went back and re-read a paragraph I kinda skimmed across... the one involving the guild war. As I said, that suits mine, and that of my guild's needs more than it does yours. At lvl 26 I dont think that im THAT far behind you guys. Believe me I know you have many 30+ and probably some into the forties. In general though Im not so far behind you to be insignificant... well maybe myself alone wouldnt mean much, but their are many others 20+ in HoW. <P>Sure, you guys definitely have us lvl-wise at this point... *shrug*. However A war is a war, given the opportunity I believe we would rise to the occasion. Conflict drives progression. Just my .02~<P>-Rek

Do you think we would "war" and have some solo level 20's running around for someone to pick off? You aren't thinking too clearly. As I said, we take war seriously. <P>War = death for our opponents. Not a friendly game of darts at the local pub where we clap each other on the back for a dart well thrown. No, war with KAAOS means death. <P>No, it would not be you at level 26 picking off a couple stragler level 20 IE's. It would be a situation of you facing 30 - 40 people 10+ levels above you constantly every second you were logged in, you and everyone in your guild. With your guild's level average being 14 you couldn't expect much in the way of support. Your bind point would be found and every one of you would be deleveled back to infancy. Our guild would stop everything to spend every waking moment hammering every one of you constantly until there was not a one of you left with the will to log in. Yes, 1 lone level 26 fuck would be insignificant. As I said, it would not be a war, it would be a slaughter. <P>When there is a challenge then seek us out for a war. Right now, your guild poses no challenge, no threat. As I told Meram a few weeks ago, it's a bit early for you all to be thinking war. Level up, learn the game, put a mark on the map then come to us for your funeral.<P>It's a simple concept to understand, we are not the idiot police, it's not our job to bitch slap every level 10 guild running around that ridiculously challenges us to a war. Think about it, go back and re-read all the posts. Realize who came where to start what. Seperate yourself from your guild for a moment as you contemplate the situation. If you have half a brain you will see just what a bunch of retards your guild is full of and/or making themselves out to be. <P>Azmodion<BR>KAAOS

For what this means, take the points CN has on SZ and add it to the IE total and draw your own conclusion. <P>"Infernal Elite" was a KAAOS/CC joint venture in TZ to combat the boredom of watching Wolfpack pour out the molasses known as SB.  It was originally formed to cap out at level 20 but the competition at that level was atrocious and a number of the original group leveled up to 50.<P>Rigs<BR>~KAAOS God of Explanations~

I just have a few things to say about this argument.  <P>KAAOS:  You shouldn't wine and yell about being the best out, you SHOULD accept new challenges and face TCEers as your new challenge.  You have to remember that a brand new guild can destroy a guild that is 10 years old easily, it all depends on how they start out.  Also if someone doesn't wants to duel you and they reject, it doesn't mean that they know you can beat them, they just know that there is a chance they could lose and don't want to spend their time getting their corpse.  You should be afraid of TCE that at a point they could destroy you, Confident, cocky, lazy, dead.  This is Dread's motto in the Otherland series and it is very true.  If you KAAOSers believe you can roxxor TCE so much you might begin to stop playing as much and not get better gear and when you face TCE you &lt;b&gt;&lt;I&gt;"might"&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/I&gt; only have Lady Vox gear and they have North Wing ToV gear.  You have to take extreme precaution with high level guilds.  <P>  Always remember these few statements.<P>

You don't really claim to be. This sounds to me like a grand ploy to fuck with some guild; talk trash on their behalf and call yourself "Anonymous."<P>The truth is, House of Wrath is one of if not the largest guild on SZ. It should be much higher on the ladder than it is, by sheer numbers.
