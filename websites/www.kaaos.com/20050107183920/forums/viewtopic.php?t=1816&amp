<br />

<br />
So many years ago the ironic side of calling my grenade launcher “the big pipe” gave me a little chuckle.  Now I just shivered in the cold and watched the overheated barrel steam into the Ceryshen wind.  They were coming.  We’d be ready.  We sat quietly in the snow trying to get our breathing under control after running up the hill behind us.  
<br />

<br />
On my left a guy we called OakSilencer stood in a heavy armor MAX suit.  He held as still as you can in one of those contraptions, creaking now and then as he moved to loosen the freezing joints up.  He didn’t have much cover behind our mutually shared boulder, but he wouldn’t need to much in a minute.  When those Vanu bastards start pouring out of the tower below he’d step out and unload 74 rounds a second into their newly recovered flesh.  He’d send them back to be rebuilt again and let them feel the unholy agony of a spawn tube.
<br />

<br />
On my right I heard McGilla snap another magazine into his chaingun.  The old man was steaming a bit too as he rummaged into his pack.  Wiping the frost from his goggles I saw the wicked scar on his face was bright with exertion.  Too bad that wound would never heal.  He’d gotten that just before the change.  Hell, I lost my right eye in a knife fight with some New Conglomerate prick about 2 hours before the change and, although I’ve died and been reconstructed half a million times since then, I still bleed from the wound on occasion.  Fat lot of fucking good these advanced medics were.  They only care to make you whole again enough to go out and kill these assholes on some god forsaken continent some fucking Command Rank 5 jerk picks for us to die again at.
<br />

<br />
Some of the more preachy motherfuckers tell us that we continue this three way war of eternity so that we can find technology in an orderly fashion.  These asshole Vanu pricks and their big dick New Conglomerate twins are trying to fight back because they want the technology.  Sounds great in a chapel back in Sanctuary… but out here it’s just a fucking bloodbath because that’s what we know how it’s done.  Fuck them.  We’re in hell and I’m the meanest motherfucker to send em back to their own chapels to pray for and end to all this.  I’m with KAAOS now.  There’s no other duty.  I don’t get into all that preachy shit.  I drop with my grunt brothers and fuck up whatever I see.  I’m in Hell and the only way to survive in Hell is to be The Devil himself.
<br />

<br />
KAAOS.  Christ, how the fuck did I end up here?  I’ve shot at these fuckers for decades but when the smoke cleared there was nobody standing but me and them.  Great.  I’m fucking immortal.  I’m shooting at fucking immortals.  So fuck it.  Sign me up with the immortals.  My brain is only twisted around one goddam thing any more… what have I got to do to get more blood?  My life isn’t satisfied unless theirs a pool of blood around my ankles and I’ve got some shitheads guts dripping down my face.  They do the job.  I do mine.  I don’t give a shit where the “cause” is any more.  I’m in it for the blood and they give it.  I call McGilla the old man.  Shit, I’m just as old as he is but I don’t have to look at my own grey hair.  I just keep making sure nobody gets any older than he and I are and I guess we’re OK.
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">“Gal Drop Tower!”</span> came the call over our head sets snapping us out of the revelry.  Time to get evil.  <span style="font-weight: bold">“We got it”</span> I replied calmly into the mic as I shook the snow off my collar and snapped off the safety on my weapon.  McGilla grunted as he got up and ready for the sprint.
<br />

<br />
We watched on the Com-link as a red bird silhouetted over us and on to the tower.  I saw the red dots of enemy personnel appear and looked up in time to see the contrail lines from the drop dampeners flying up from the jets on the Vanu’s belts as they dropped from the plane.  I could smell the jammer grenades they had tipped out the window before their drop.  So much for the mines.   Oak stepped out on the left and let them have it with his dual machine guns.  I popped three plasma grenades up into the sky and hauled ass for the other side not waiting to see if they fell on target.  My objective was to contain and harass, not plink.  It was time to move.  We just didn’t want any to miss the roof and come down on our backside.
<br />

<br />
As they hit the deck on top of the roof and ran in the door Oak hazed them with his bullet spitting MAX suit.  I heard the Spitfire I’d placed earlier barking on the opposite end of the tower.  The yells and death screams on the roof told me Oak was doing his job, the barking spitfire on the other side told me our backs were covered as well.  Now it was time to do our job.
<br />

<br />
The Chainman and I ran up to the North door and get ready to do our ugly business.  We call it the “Skull Fuck”.  These Vanu pricks were about to take a tower and make it a basis for invasion on the nearby base of Tarqaq… the last fortification against the NC we Terrans held… at least, that’s what they thought they were doing.  The real plan was to pin them down and let them waste time dealing with us while some Command Fuck and his pack of untrained wolves hacked in on some other continent four thousand miles from here.  It was a pointless operation, but that’s why they call us Special Forces.  Nobody could do this shit like a bunch of goat fucking freaks like KAAOS.  That’s what keeps us in business.
<br />

<br />
McGilla put his back against the wall just close enough to keep the door open and readied his chaingun to cover my back.  “Give em hell” he muttered as I aimed the grenade launcher toward the slit in the door.  “One sec” I muttered as we waited for the tower’s operational systems to turn over control to the godless Vanu.  One second to let them think they had the operational basis they needed, and then we’d turn on the juice.  As we waited we heard OakSilencer move into position and lock his turrets down on the other side.  This was going to be a slaughter.
<br />

<br />
With a thunk we heard the Spawn Tubes down in the basement begin to hum bringing the souls of enemy grunts back from the dead below.  I counted to three and let fly with half my magazine set to three second delay.  The balls of green plasma whiffed down the steps and around the hallway corner just as I’d practiced it a thousand times.  “Pop, Pop, Pop” they exploded giving me a white confirmation in the sites with each piece of skin they burned.  “Pop, Pop, Pop” the fun was just beginning and the death toll rose with each round.
<br />

<br />
McGill opened up with his machine gun tearing into the meat puppets who made it to the door.  Five of six rounds was all it took to finish off the poor slobs that made it up the stairs.  I could hear Oak burning through ammunition from the other entrance and heard the screams of his prey.  There’s nothing quite as unholy as turning a corner to find a dual cycler machine gun MAX locked down and burning lead into your guts.  The black burning smell of roasted flesh and gun smoke began to choke the Vanu fucks in the basement below.  Their laments did little but ease the familiar smile to my face as I saw their corpses pile up below us on the ramp.  I don’t know how long it went on.  We were in a killing frenzy.  Every wound we took was returned with eight or ten of those pricks seeing God, even if it was for only a minute at a time.
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">“Mission complete.  Recall-Recall.  Get in the Air and get to rally point.  We’ve got a mission on Foreseral” </span>said the voice over system.  Hedron playing mind games again.  Dive in and skull fuck the Enemy Vanu only to lure them into a head to head battle with the Enemy New Conglomerate.  Three bastards of the Tarran Republic may have just tipped the scales toward victory.  It’s a good, if your only skill is death and dismemberment.  Fuck ‘em.  This is KAAOS.
<br />

<br />
I chuckled as I looked over at McGilla.  He wasn’t looking so hot anyway.  His armor had broken into bits and his chest was covered with wounds from the flak.  I looked down and realized my own blood had created a puddle below me and a flap of skin hung lazily from the back of my hand.  I wasn’t going to last long and neither was the old man.  We could have rushed down the stairs and died in a blaze of Republican Glory or we could take our own lives and deny them the satisfaction.  I turned to McGilla and shot a plasma grenade into his stomach.  The blast hit us both as we laughed the glee of the dammed.  My corpse crumpled with the gangrene burns of suicide in a slaughterhouse.

<br />

<br />
I realize your opinion of yourself includes such absolute omnipotence and perfection in every way that the entire effort will be lost on you, but there are numerous things you could learn.  Knowing full well that the additional effort required to point out areas which I feel you could use some wisdom is pointless, I'll highlight one of them nonetheless.
<br />

<br />
Cork, back in the old days we used to augment our gaming experience with our imaginations.  We thought gaming more fun if we imagined ourselves involved in a pursuit beyond the point and click.  By concidering our efforts as part of a larger story line our efforts had additional meaning.  Our gaming experience became more rich as a result through a self created emotional attachment which, in many cases, allowed for a deeper immersion into the game at hand. 
<br />

<br />
Unfortunatly, through the dawn of "Massive" online gaming it seems that the currently prevelent mentality has decended into a pointless pursuit of levels and shiney objects.  Though the graphics and detail found in online games has increase at exponential rates, the immersion within games seems to have lessened at a similar rate.  Perhaps the expansion of detail is actually the culperate, in fact.  In the days where online games were limited to ANSII text alone we were forced to use our imaginations.  Frankly, I remember the days where imagination was required as better days in comparison todays shiney pixel driven gaming.
<br />

<br />
As (probably) the youngest of the KAOOS Planetside outfit (at least by seeming action) you represent an example of the differences between the Old Way and the New.  At the rick of sounding preachy, take for example, your current effort to achieve CR levels.  You've stated that your reasoning for this effort, at the expense of other's pursuit of such, is that you want to be able to draw on the global map.  You've made no attempt at trying to initiate leadership, nor organize the troops to increase the overall effectiveness of the squad you run or KAAOS Planetside as a whole.  Your efforts are singlular and self motivated.  This is not a repremand on your desire to achieve, just an observation that the current mentality of online gaming, despite the presence of so many more thousands of players, is shifting more towards the individual.
<br />

<br />
Were you to concider yourself part of an elite, but ultimatly damned, crew of professional killers working together as a very tight team, as described in the story above, you might concider the situation in a different light.  Were you to use your imagination to assign larger goals and ultimate fates to our actions as a group within the game you would, I believe, view your efforts within a higher ultimate challenge... one that is for KAAOS Planetside rather than yourself.  Those efforts might include giving the SL slot and the CR derived from that slot over to someone who would actually use the benefits of CR level to the advantage of KAAOS as a whole rather than to your personal advancement.  Again, not a gripe, but an observation.
<br />

<br />
I don't mean this to be a lecture on your pursuit of CR levels.  The point is that if we were concider ourselves as significant members of an alternate (if fictional) reality our actions, and enjoyment, would be richer and more fullfilling in the long term.  
<br />

<br />

<br />
Here's another theory, although much more sureal, it strikes me as interesting - Many of us come from a background where we read a lot of books and thought "I'd like to experience that" and, within the context of online gaming, try to fulfil that dream.  The older folks couldn't be a part of it aside from imagination until recently.  Thus we are expanding our dream world.  A younger crowd may skip the books and jump right into the online gaming experience where-in they are actually approaching reality from the side of experiencing gaming first.  Thereby, defining their world through the experiences developed within online gaming rather than defining game experience from the context of the "real world".

Ahh, i see you can't take a joke(the drawing @ cr3 WAS A JOKE!!! WOW THAT MUSTA FLEW RIGHT OVER YOUR FUCKING HEAD). You must be one of the people still with the "old ways". You were on when i was logging off.
<br />

<br />
Hedron didn't even want to lead an attack on another cont, how would u know if i didn't organize troops since you weren't online when we were taking searhus back; i was putting wps and saying to meet up and then move to wp2 - but you logged when we were actually accomplishing things.
<br />

<br />
 I dont "lead" like Hedron, Biral, Tyo, Kaljoren, Player / other SLs because i dont have a mic(maybe i'll get one on day!). All of them mentioned are better SLs than me, I will admit that and let them take over; as i normally do.
<br />

<br />
I suggest this to you Faust: disconnect your mic and try leading efficiently. Then come back to me and report the results. I'll tell you what you will achieve:
<br />

<br />
Longer delays - its much more efficient for the person making commands to have a mic, why Biral was talking last night, i know what needs to be done ( no i dont know it all ) but a more leader oriented person can certainly tell to move to the wp, etc.
