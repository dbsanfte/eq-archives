                                    writing this document for some time, but never 
                                    seemed to get around to it. I&nbsp;have been 
                                    watching the recent exodus of experienced 
                                    players from the game, however, and it has 
                                    really spurred the urge for me to put this 
                                    together to possibly stop the good players 
                                    from leaving.</font></P>
                                  <P><font size="-1">There's definitely a large 
                                    number of problems with Ultima Online. That's 
                                    clear. But for as many disappointments as 
                                    the bugs cause, I&nbsp;see more people walking

                                    with other players. What strikes me about 
                                    this is that the people involved just don't 
                                    see the whole cycle. They don't understand 
                                    how and why the players play the way they 
                                    do, and because of that they don't see how 
                                    the current behavior of most of the UO players 
                                    can ever lead to the kind of gaming experience

                                    of NPCs and stat building, finishing that 
                                    part of the cycle, getting bored, and moving

                                    something I invented, it's something I have 
                                    experienced myself, and watched others experience 
                                    it. The observations I'm making come from 
                                    a long history of playing online games, and/or 
                                    participating in online communities. In some 
                                    way shape or form, I've been hanging with 
                                    people online since around 1986, beginning 
                                    with pre-internet (or at least pre publicly 
                                    used, web based internet) local 6 person chat 
                                    rooms and BBSes, up through services like

                                    etc. Not that I'm particularly interested

                                    but I think it's important to know that I've

                                    just guessing about how it works. For over 
                                    10 years, one way or another, I've been watching 
                                    people interact online. In terms of player 
                                    interactive computer games, I've played Diablo,

                                <P>Most players move through a hierarchy of playing, 
                                  advancing through states of maturity as characters 
                                  and players in the game. I don't mean maturity 
                                  in the sense of real world adult sensibilities, 
                                  I just mean in terms of fully developed game 
                                  skills, knowledge, and characters. The point 
                                  of writing this up is this: think about where 
                                  you're at in this cycle, think about where the 
                                  people that you're playing with are at in this 
                                  cycle, and think about what the over-all effect 
                                  on the gaming experience will be in Ultima once 
                                  enough people have been around long enough to 
                                  make it through these stages. </P>
                                <P>That's the whole key. The highest forms of 
                                  play are in the upper stages. The player base 
                                  has not had time to reach them on a general 
                                  level, which means that finding people that 
                                  are high enough up the circles to play with 
                                  is tough.. (Pursuit of the lower circles often 
                                  leads to what some players consider &quot;power&quot; 
                                  playing and that some call &quot;abusive&quot;.)</P>
                                <P>(Also, worth mentioning is the fact that some 
                                  of us out there may not have even tried to go 
                                  through each of these Circles in Ultima. Players

                                    that can be programmed into it. It's at this 
                                    point that people have exhausted them. They 
                                    need something new, and there are only a few

                                    you'll just move on to one of the others.

                                    the order that most seem to move through them, 
                                    but it's fairly likely that the average player 
                                    will just skip around to whatever holds their 
                                    interest. The DEGREE&nbsp;to which you explore 
                                    these is also variable. If you're not very 
                                    strategic, you might just barely touch PVP, 
                                    but then get neck-deep into RP, or visa versa. 
                                    The bottom line, though is that since all 
                                    of these items are about interacting with 
                                    other people (except MAYBE #1), if you don't 
                                    have other people to interact with that are 
                                    exploring the category you've chosen, then 
                                    you don't have anything. That's the problem 
                                    that UO&nbsp;is suffering from right now.

                                    aaahhh! Now here's the real beauty. Fighting 
                                    NPCs is a chore, fighting real people (in 
                                    the right game environment) is an ART! UO&nbsp;has 
                                    yet to see ANY&nbsp;of this to my knowledge. 
                                    All it has is PK (player killing). Simplistic 
                                    brainless slug fests with no technique or 
                                    talent. This art will develop. The highest 
                                    form of this is 1 on 1 (in my opinion anyway, 
                                    although could change my mind yet). And for 
                                    those who think that the UO&nbsp;interface 
                                    precludes this, let me just say that there 
                                    are a TON of ideas that have not been explored 
                                    yet. And unlike many other games, if there's 
                                    things that make it suck, just get 'em to 
                                    change it. Now I agree, bug exploitation for 
                                    instant kills is a joke. I'm not talking about 
                                    that. I'm talking about the ART&nbsp;of PVP. 
                                    Nothing in this brief paragraph can describe 
                                    the full scope of PVP, so don't underestimate 
                                    it. And the synergy of player versus player 
                                    with ALL of the other circles is the life-blood 
                                    of a game IMO.</font></P>

                                    to the game like nothing else. In my opinion,

                                    lot of people. However, my own observation 
                                    is that the chat interface in UO is pretty 
                                    bad, so people won't really chat in this game.</font></P>

                                    posting RP and such. When this is based around
