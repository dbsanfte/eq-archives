<H1>UO - Balancing Player Types by Geography</H1>

<p>Thron, yer right.

<p>What people don't seem to understand is that this game, like any game that's multi-player SHOULD BE about interaction between players.  There are two main game-playing types of that interaction.

<p>1) Cooperative play - This involves groups of people banding together to face the challenges of the game.  The type of people who play this way like to deal with a structured, non-aggressive set of challenges that they can take on at their own pace.  And that's why they don't like PVP or PKing, becuase it's an extremely aggresive situation against the toughest "monsters" in the game (real people) in an unpredictable setting.

<p>This type of play inevitable leads to either a) stagnation once all the challenges of the game are conquered, or b) role play.

<p>2) PVP - This is the clashing of player versus player, preferably on an even playing field (i.e. all involved characters are of a similar stat level ).  People who enjoy this kind of thing are interested in pitting their own OOC skills in manipulating the variables given them by the game to beat each other.  Simple slug fests don't satisfy them.  It's the challenge of going head to head in an environment where anyone can win.

<p>This type of play generally stays challenging for far longer.

<p>If the game balance is off in any direction, it's death for the game.  If there's too much of type 1 encouraged then the arguably larger market of type 2 players leave, and 50% of type 1 get bored EVENTUALLY and leave.

<p>If there's too much of type 2 encouraged, type one players get frustrated and leave, and type 2 players eventually get bored and leave.

<p>The only way to have an active game in the long term is to have balance in both.  AND, the only way to allow both to co-exist is to separate them geographically.

<p>Make certain dungeons and zones NON-PVP, and others PVP based.  Type 1 players will start in their areas, and eventually move into PVP, type 2 players will start in their areas, and eventually move in Role Play.

<p>Until OSI understands that they MUST have both to win, all classes and actions in UO will be watered down to try and have no geographic dividing lines between them, and let both types get along.  In which case (such as with the current weakening of magery) the game will stink.

<p>Here's the ON topic part (laugh) until you fix OSI's understanding of this, the patches won't make sense.  They'll get to the full understanding via trial and error over a LONG and GRUELING period of time filled with sucky game playing.

<p>Regards,
