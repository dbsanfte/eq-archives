"It would take many many hours of playing to feel godlike in any game."

"but he would be an average player in a new environment or game until he met up with his KAAOS friends or played enough hours to be semi-good. "

I am very skeptical but you might have actually learned something during your stay here but it needs some clarification.

First, the KAAOSer would learn the game before going out into the world. They would have analyzed it backwards, forwards and inside out to the point where countless strategies have already been worked out. 95% of those that play games do not have the common sense to learn before attempting to accomplish anything of note. Those who fail to prepare, prepare to fail. That is what differntiates a KAAOSer from the faceless losers of the gaming community.

Secondly, as the KAAOSer subscribes to the first rule religously he/she is automatically elevated from the status of ever being an average player. They have done it countless times before in many different arenas and as such it simply gets easier and easier each time. 

The only saving grace of the typical computer loser is that the gaming companies of today want their money and as such they do not design systems that truly reward the most intelligent or most strategic. The fact tht numbers do matter in today's games highlights this gaming weakness. The sad part is that the gaming companies do not seem to care about this and in fact 90% of the players enjoy that it is done this way. The emphatic shift to real time, graphically dynamic, completely customizable characters are three of the main reasons why games today do not award strategically intelligent individuals and it's a damn shame.
