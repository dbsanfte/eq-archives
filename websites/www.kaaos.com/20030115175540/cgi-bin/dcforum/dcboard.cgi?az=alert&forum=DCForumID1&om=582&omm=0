The person named GeostormS has a few remote opinions:

1.	I would have to say yes. If you have twenty five guys on at all times I would be happy. If I had twenty five guys total in my guild who never play the same time as me then I would be sad. I notice on a Saturday that there are 4 KAAOS and 41 on my team with mIRC.
2.	Size does matter for Star Wars Galaxies since they didn't name is Star Wars Galaxy.
3.	Duh! I have met your kind before. 
Action- A not so popular person posts an interesting poll. Reaction- A troll like SangDraxx or War brings nothing to the discussion but taunts the person that has an interesting thought. The troll tries to discredit the one that had thought with a one liner. Never with a long drawn out comeback. I have proved that there are servers called galaxies in SWG. At least I know some basic shit.
4.	There you go again Sangdraxx; looking for a bite.
5.	Are we still discussing games? War and games are two different subjects. A young person could still beat an older person in chess. Just because you are big or have a lot of strength doesn’t mean you can kill a mage for example. The art of war could not be used while playing most games. Shadowbane might change that since land can be conquered and loot will be 100 times better. Leaders are more important than before since they will do a lot more than gather up players or ban them if they do a bad job. They have to hire some guards much like UO factions and they have to gather up resources to build. In the UO factions there were only three or four faction guards. This game could have no limit on the amount of guards if your guild has many members. With many members you can have much more gold. With many members you can attack any castle you want. And get even more gold. With more members you can hold an election and have a good leader, and so on. The KAAOS guild might have a tougher time even with god like tactics since the entire guild will be made up of a group of homeless members. Instead of KAAOS let’s call them Kids at an Orphan Society? Just a thought.
6.	No leaders will get back to you with email with a decision. They will just say a few well spoken words till you puke. Seems to me they are too slow at finding good members. You have to show how good you are before you can show up which is why I am wondering why they would even add a request form to sign up.
7.	Ever have so much lag that you died from your own poisoned weapon? Ever have too much lag that you died from an imp, very slowly. Or have an enemy guild gate right by you and have too much lag to escape. List some other ways that you died that was dumb as hell here becouse of lag or other reasons.
