Chess can be a role playing game. And yes, Planetside can be a role playing game as well.<P>With the creation of AI it is a pvp reality in the making. I was playing this single game and will be given the chance in the future to download a persons playing style. The person who wants to play can choose a player from the Metaverse to play and simulate that player in a game. That way I can be given a chance to play a pvp game and not have to worry about that person being there for the whole game. What I am talking about is this new single player game called Galactic Civilizations.  So one down two to go. <P>Chess can be an RPG!!!<P>If you have a mean guy playing a conservative player you can have dialogue in the game. You can also play a master chess player and feel like a newbie. <P>Planetside can be a RPG because any player can gain ranks and be called upon to help his team. So each person can play a role. <P>I win I win again!<BR></blockquote><hr><b><font size=2>Table of contents</font></b><hr>

<b>"With the creation of AI it is a pvp reality in the making."</b><P>Even if you could program your exact movements and patterns into an NPC, you cannot simulate human logic and error.  NPCs do not get caught up in the heat of the moment.  Their hands do not get sweaty and shake, making battle somewhat tougher to concentrate on.  They don't get nervous and realize someone's stronger than them.  It's impossible.<P>To even simulate the speed of the human brain, you need to have a computer half the size of a football field, at least.  And to program the errors and adrenaline that players often experience?  Not possible.

Yea I was just joking with the AI. But this new game says you can download these player styles to play against from a database, which is better than AI.
