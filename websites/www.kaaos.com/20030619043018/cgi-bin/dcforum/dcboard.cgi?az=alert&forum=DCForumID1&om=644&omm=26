I remember why I still read this shit, and now I even remember why I post here.. every now and again. I need the comical relief. 

Would you have schooled me in PVP in NW, prolly. Would you have always done so.. maybe. 

And your "stages of development" they sound alot like Hedron's circles. Are you trying to make up for some of your own personal misgivings there? Trying to emulate someone you actually "worship"? Or are you going to tell me now that Hed got that shit from you, and you are the actual gaming guru and everyone else emulates you? 

When I found NWN I was amazed. The gold box games that I had loved playing were brought to life in a multi-player enviroment that was just to good to be true. But, soon after a couple of $700 AOL bills I had to wean myself to a reasonable amount of playing time. (yea, I know.. this is where you tell me you had $1000 bills, I don't care) When I decided to keep my time to a $200 +/- range I used my time to have fun in the game, which is what I am sure we all did. Some people lived for being the very best in any one facet of the game, some used it as a chat room, some just sat at the banks/town center and did what ever the fuck they were doing. For you to sit here and tell me what the fuck you think I am because of how I decided to spend my time within NW is as arogant as thinking you were something special in NW combat. Do you think, even for a moment, that if NW had a player base of the tens of thousands of players that current games have today that you would have been able to be as dominant? There would have been that many more people like you, with the same thought process, the same expertise in the same small facet of the game, and the same will to win. In short, there would have been a thousand players with the same mindset and skill as you. That would have made it impossible to "tell you which fighters were text book fighters, which fighters were improvisers, which fighters were aggressive or defensive". 

Maybe that is why you have such a hard time with the games of current. Your not special in your own little world of 100. Yea, I'll say it... 100, 100 people who played NW simply for the PVP action that was there. Congrats. -golf clap-
