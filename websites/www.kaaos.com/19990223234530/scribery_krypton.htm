          <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>KAAOS 
            ON KRYPTON</b></font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The God toiled. 
            His pick swung again and again into the side of the mountain, and 
            the wall of stone gave way bit by bit. It was a slow and tedious process 
            forcing the earth to give up its riches.</font> </p>
          <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> The laboring 
            man really was a strange sight. There was a certain aura of strength 
            and menace about him, and yet his appearance was unremarkable. He 
            wore light armor, and an average blade hung at his side. His clothes 
            were well made, and yet certainly not extravagant. The muscles that 
            played beneath his skin were strong and solid, and yet there were 
            more like those of a worker peasant than those of some great hero… 
            and yet… and yet. There was more here than there seemed to be. </font></P>
          <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> Any watchers 
            who might have puzzled at this subtle mystery would have been enlightened 
            if they could have heard the thoughts and seen the sights echoing 
            inside the man's head. </font></P>
          <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> Inside of the 
            God, the memory played of his life as it had been. He saw grand circumstances, 
            admiring crowds, revolting deaths, epic battles… Oh the battles he 
            saw - contests of guile, strength, and magic that broke the earth 
            beneath him, and shattered the sky above him. He heard thousands whisper, 
            sometimes in terror, sometimes in awe, the name "False Prophet". This 
            was no ordinary man. </font></P>
          <P> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><i>Swing, clank, 
            thud</i><BR>
            <i>Swing, clank, thud</i><BR>
            <i>Swing, clank, thud</i><BR>
            </font></P>
          <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> The mining went 
            on as the God felt the echoes of his life in another realm reverberate 
            through him, and endured his life as it was now. For this was a new 
            world. The False Prophet had fled the land he had been in at the last 
            moments as it had crumpled in on itself, destroying everything forever, 
            and had traveled to this one. </font></P>
          <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> And now he was 
            here. A bland, tedious place called Sosaria. When he had first arrived, 
            his new body and mind had been weak, but the iron will that had propelled 
            him to greatness in world after world before this still dwelt in him, 
            ice cold, and metal hard. He knew that with each new realm that he 
            traveled to he had to begin again, but it was never a daunting task 
            to him. The ages of combat and strife in world after world had made 
            him wise, and his climb to dominance in each new world had always 
            been quick and sure, and where it had been neither quick nor sure, 
            it had always been exciting. </font></P>
          <P> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><i>Swing, clank, 
            thud</i><BR>
            <i>Swing, clank, thud</i><BR>
            <BR>
            The sound of the pickaxe continued. </font></P>
          <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> This world was 
            different, though. When he had first arrived, he had inhaled deeply 
            of the air, and felt the familiar rush of legends waiting to be written. 
            But now that he had been here for some time, he knew the truth. This 
            world was NOT a world of heroes and gods, emperors and priest-kings. 
            No, this was a world of miners and tailors. He had come to learn that 
            the physics of this world did not permit the grand excesses of his 
            past lives. He could not rise to a position of dominance here, because 
            this was a world of balance. Each expenditure of great power required 
            that you first expend the effort and the money to produce it. In this 
            world gaining the fuel to expend in titanic wars meant weeks of labor 
            for every minor clash. </font></P>
          <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> But this was 
            not right. When he had obtained a sense of how this world worked, 
            it felt instinctually wrong to him. The gods who created worlds did 
            not do so for the sake of balance and economics. They created them 
            for their amusement! For the doing of great deeds, and the clashing 
            of great armies! They created worlds to look down on as the beings 
            that inhabited them mustered all of their might and burned themselves 
            away in flashes of glory. </font></P>
          <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> And yet here 
            in this world, no one burned in a flash of glory, instead they just 
            grew gradually smaller as the demands of obtaining power sanded them 
            away. </font></P>
          <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> When he realized 
            this, the God took himself to a quiet and deep cave and closed his 
            eyes. He meditated, and in a magical state of trance, he began to 
            hear the words and intentions of the gods who had created this world. 
            It was true! As obscene as it was, no greatness could be obtained 
            here. The laws of this world demanded that so much time be spent in 
            honest labor that conquest was merely a hobby practiced on weekends 
            after long days of work. And the gods had meant to do it! </font></P>
          <P> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><i>Swing, clank, 
            thud</i> </font></P>
          <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> The God began 
            to regret ever coming here. He could sense no hope for this world, 
            and like other stagnant lands before this one, he could see its future. 
            The strong would migrate away to better lands where their energy and 
            ambition would lead to becoming lords of the realm rather than leading 
            to a need to become a peasant. Meanwhile the weak would stay here, 
            secure in their familiarity, and yet slowly dying off. In the not-too-distant 
            future this would be a cold dark world. And the God would not be here 
            to see it. That much he vowed. </font></P>
          <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> This world would 
            change, or he would find better. With that in mind, he began to plan 
            a journey to the temples of the gods who had created this world, where 
            he had decided he would offer up a prophecy. Not a prayer, for the 
            God prayed to no being, man nor god, but a prophecy. He would tell 
            these gods their future, and they would either listen and prosper, 
            or ignore him and whither and die. </font></P>
          <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> The God turned, 
            his resolve strong, and took two steps down the road. Then he remembered… 
            no one in this gray and depressing world could do anything without 
            first doing the work. He set aside his adventurer's nature and closeted 
            the desire he felt to rush out and live life, and instead he started 
            the preparations for his long and boring journey to come. </font></P>
