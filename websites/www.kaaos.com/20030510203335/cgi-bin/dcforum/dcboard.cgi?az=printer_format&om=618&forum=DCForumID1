Quantity is becoming more and more important in some RPG Online that ever before. More specialist to help a clan such as in Neocron. Not all members have to be good at pvp and more and more people are dependant on quantity than quality of a player.<P>Your just sad that you don't have any thoughts about it. But nice try. Har Har :)

<P>  I want to shove a charred fetus into your stomach and procreate with your innards.  <P>Hehe.. 3;&gt;<P>  Geo, I can not wait for the story of your death to make some major news network.   <P>"Another poor kid passed away in front of his computer.  He sustained for a period of a week, glued to his monitor, off his own refuse -- amazingly."  <P>  That is the more realistic one, personally I'd rather hear something like this...<P>Hehe.. 3;&gt;<P>"A travesty of a story.  Some poor child was strip, raped, and strangled by his own father.  Sources say his father could no longer stand the stupidity of his son.  His child was found burnt, mutilated, dismembered, and various parts of his body was used in sexual ways.  Surprisingly, people are giving praise to the father and thanking him."<P>End your worthless life, maggot.  You make me want to brutalize pregnant women.<P>Hehe.. 3;&gt;<P>Die in Pain.
