         <blockquote>
         The sun's crimson rays burned on, turning the summer day into sweltering restlessness. A tiny smirk cracked Nemesis' normally cold facade that day, nothing would keep him from the pleasure of his work this day. It was a special day, being a Child of the Damned himself, the anniversary of the Turning held special significance to Nemesis.<BR>His figure cast lethargically on the ground in front of the small town's only tavern, just the perfect position to watch his current task complete itself. He had already done his part, it was now time to sit back and enjoy. He had wisely planned ahead, the spot he occupied now was at excellent watching distance. The small temple blazed brilliantly, a bonfire set in the middle of the villiage.<P>A low chuckle escaped his lips as the irony played out in his mind. Just the thought that disciples of the Cleansing Flame were being set as fuel to a blazing inferno. To Nemesis' delight the shrill cries of tiny children pierced the air like dozens of sharp needles. His grin widened, subconciously mumbling under his breath, "Oh yes the real spectacle is about to begin."<P>His laugh originated deep in his chest, turning from a low chuckle to uproarious laughter just as the front door to the temple burst open. Allowing a large pack of pigmy sized human torches to frantically run about the central yard. Their panic had afforded almost as much gratification to Nem as the pain the children were surely experiancing. This was a bit beter than he had planned, they helplessly waddled about, punctured by thousands of tiny shards of stained glass. Their miniature strides limited as those glorious silken robes slowly melted into their flesh.<BR>His orgasm of pleasure climaxed as the tiny figures fell to the ground one by one, flesh burning and boiling off of their tiny bones as those last few moments of life were stricken with intense suffering. A slight odor of cooked fat laced the air and tickled Nem's nose. Townsfolk rushed forward, distressed as they were unable to aide the smoldering youngsters, they were already corpses, nothing could change that now. Nemesis giggled tirelessly as he watched the various onlookers wept in the most pitiful way imaginable, this would never grow old.<P>Nem's fun lasted long into the night, the building blazed on until nothing more than a smoking frame and a pile of ashes and corpses remained. Only Nemesis seemed to enjoy the way weeping family members continued to drag blackened, twisted victims out of the glowing wreckage. This macabre ritual of mourning lasted almost until the sun arose the next day.<P>They were too busy dealing with the initial shock and loss caused by the horrid event to think why. None within the entire town's population had thought to raise any suspicion as to how the fire was started until the next day. He was long gone by that time. Nothing but a vague rumor of his prescence remained of him.<P>Nemesis had celebrated this milestone for as far back as he could remember. This event's killing would not have been complete unless the innocent had suffered. He had received nothing other than the pleasure of taking lives. That was the way of the killing spirit.<P>-Nemesis <BR>
