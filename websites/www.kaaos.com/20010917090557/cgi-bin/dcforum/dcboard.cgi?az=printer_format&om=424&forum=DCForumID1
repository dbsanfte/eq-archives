Hahahaha. Ahh, you guys never fail to crack me up. All this condescension you'd think you already own the server. I cant believe you're even trying to pull the whole "We r playin fer long term" BS. Face it, no matter which way you spin it you are hiding from PvP. Not unstoppable odds, not an unfair disadvantage (as if they even mattered in PvP anyway) you are dismissing PvP. TCE has fought maybe twice as a group in the Commons. One of those times they came to us. We know as well as you do that lowbie wars arent the be all end all of PvP. However, thats not the point. The point is you actually HIDE from it, thats so sad its not even funny. You dont even have to seek it out, just face it when it comes, but your too weak for even that.<P>Sad sad sad.

Well Hedron, you seem pretty determined to prove your point to those you have reffered to as "gnats".<P>Unfortunately you ended up proving my point exactly. You need'nt run around searching out newb battles but when one comes to you and could have been dealt with in under an hour you hide. Its not a question of time out of your busy schedule. How do I know this? Because I was standing there while KAAOS was huddled around the zone. In the time you spent there making sure no one "endangered" themselves with messages like "KAAOS, stay here, do not zone!" you could have simply walked out and dealt with the problem. It was never an issue of effort or time, the battle had come to you, and you chose to hide from it. I say get some balls and stop worrying about your sorry ass rep. Pussying out is a universal thing... its just as bad when you do it as anyone else. <P>-Rek

I'll just point to what hedron said and add that if the problem had come to us, we would have dealt with it.  As long as they were in another zone, it was someone elses problem, hell, they coulda came in and wiped all the gnats clean on the first floor (that means you fellers) and we probly still wouldnt have stopped what we were doing.  Until the problem comes to kaaos, its someone elses problem.  Hell you guys were BEGGING that we handle it for you, Did I see any of you go out to do anything? Fuck no.  You hid in a corner practically begged us to take care of them before they came and gimped you.<P>  See, theres something you havent taken into consideration about kaaos.  We really don't care about TCE.  Your a non-factor.  You were never figured into the equation because you simply dont matter.<P>  Call it dodging, call it whatever you want, nobody gives a shit but you anyways ;)<P>Rann<BR>KAAOS

You are god damn right I said not to zone out. It’s about zone control you dumbfuck. The report I had was there were around 30 nuets  AT the zone line. I’ve been in COUNTLESS battles for zone control and once another team holds a line it is stupid to zone into it, especially if you are zoning into the unknown. We do not need someone zoning out by themselves because they are “curious” and sucking a stupid death before their character is even back under their control. <P>You want an example of this? Zone into my line fuck. We will chew your gimp asses up before you even have a chance to pull your head out of your ass. <P>Some battles are won without screen caps. They wanted Befallen, we held our line. We were preping up and finding out how many people were were on the other side of the zone line. They poked in, saw us and backed out immediately, and then abandoned their line. I’m not your fairy god damn grandmother and I don’t give a fuck if you are being slaughtered. I’m not gonna run to save your gimp ass in WC. I don’t give a fuck about WC unless I’m in it. But someone comes into MY zone, they will be slaughtered. <P>After it was evident that nobody was going to contest us for our zone we moved back in deeper to xp. Meanwhile, all you little gnats hiding behind our ranks were saved from a Nuet invasion. You can post your thank you’s at www.fuckoff.com<P>Azmodion<BR>KAAOS

Here's a little internal communication for you.  We fight on whatever terms we feel like.  And we play to win.<P>If YOU are doing something OTHER than that... then you're an idiot.

Some level 8 monk asked if he could join, so Rip says "If you were a shaman we'd let you because you could heal".  The dude got pissed and started training us with skeletons, killing 2 of our group members.  Then he said, "I'm a monk, I was just pulling.  That's what monks do.  If I was a shaman, I'd heal you."  I actually laughed ;p<P>He left Kurn's and went out to Field of Bone.  After about 5 minutes, I ran out and /shouted "Is anyone grouped with Vengence.  If so, send me a /tell".  One of the 2 guys he was grouped with repsonded, so I told him to disband Vengence immediately or I'd train them all as payback for our group deaths.  He didn't respond.  I went and found them in the middle of a fight and repeated my order to disband him.  One of the lippy guys with him said, "Just a sec. and I'll kill you".<P>Being the patient God that I am, I waited.  After they finished with the mob, the guy runs over and /d's me!  Naturally, I accepted.  I started to whip his ass by jousting him, to which he replied, "Stand still you pussy!".  LOL!  As luck would have it, during the middle of our fight, 2 Greater Skeletons wander past.  I grabbed the skels and trained his ass.  His buddies jumped in and got them off of him, but not before I could taunt him and his stupidity.  To make a long story short (too late ;p), I kept jousting and he kept whining.  I eventually chased him from the zone and got my first SZ duel victory screenshot, along with some great whine.<BR> <BR>I'm going to REALLY like this server.  ;p<BR> <BR>Turmoyle<BR>---------------------------------------<P><P>Hedron<BR><a href="http://www.kaaos.com/hedron/falseprophet.htm" target="_blank">The False Prophet</a><BR><a href="http://www.kaaos.com" target="_blank">KAAOS</a><P>...No child, don't cry.

You fucking newb. You stupid fucking newb. You are gonna be slaughtered from one end of the map to the other, you will be a disgrace to your team, your guild, and yourself. Do you have any idea how to play this game? No, you don’t, because you are a newb. Do you have any idea what it means to be a PvPer? No, you don’t because you are a newb. <P>PvPers, REAL PvPers, don’t look for “advantages” they look to eliminate an opponents advantage. It’s part of the strategy involved in PvP. Levels are an advantage in EQ PvP. I don’t level so I can have an advantage over my opponents, I level to reduce my opponents advantage over me. Gear is an advantage in EQ PVP. I don’t level so that I can get cool gear so I can have an advantage, I level so that I can stop my opponent from denying me access to the gear and hoarding it for himself. <P>This war is not gonna be won by level 10s in west commons. This war is gonna be won by level 50+ in zones that matter. Zones that have the loot that increases PvP effectiveness. You, as a PvPer can NOT allow your opponent to gain zone control over the PvP loot zones and increase their advantage by denying you access to the zone. Like it or not, levels and loot are a BIG part of the PvP dynamic in EQ. A PvPer must learn to adapt to the game they are in.<P>You think I shy away from a fight? Let me tell you something newb, I have been PvPing in MMORPGs for over 7 years. I won multiple PvP championships in NWN, I kicked the shit out of people for well over a year in UO and I know this game backwards and forward. I know every class, their spells and/or disciplines and what they are capable of. I had a level 48 Druid on Rallos before Kunark. I have a level 55 Enchanter (1 blue bub from 56), a level 50 Rogue and a level 54 Shaman on Tallon. I have more PvP experience in EQ than your whole guild could ever hope to have collectively. One of the last battles I fought on Tallon before coming to Sullon was my Enchanter against a level 53 Druid AND a level 53 Necro.....1 vs 2 of the supposedly “best PvP classes”. I destroyed them. <P>Killing as an organized sport, yes. I assess my opponents and my situation quickly and I come up with a strategy to win. I understand zone control, I understand group battles, I understand the classes and their capabilities and I specialize in 1 on 1 combat. I don’t play for screen caps, I play to dominate. <P>Our “real” opponents understand this as well and are planning for this. Your guild is insignificant, a pack of newbs. You will always be insignificant on this server and unless you learn what it really means to be a PvPer you will be insignificant in every game you are in. <P>But hell, you won’t understand any of this. You are too young, inexperienced, stupid, and full of yourself. You would rather come here to disrespect me and swing your balls than to listen, learn and understand. I take exception to fuckin gimps such as yourself. You remind me of the Darken-newbs gimps we slaughtered on Rallos. So you want to swing your balls?  Swing ‘em sparky. I normally don’t waste my time on newbs but I will take time out to kick your gimp ass in a /duel this one time. Maybe then you’ll realize what a sack of worthless shit you really are. I’ll even give you a best of 5 match. After which don’t expect me to ever waste my time with you or your worthless newb guild again.<P>Azmodion<BR>KAAOS

I can see both points. As a member of TCE, I of course support the TCE position. However, I am capable of understanding one point, at least, that KAAOS makes.<P>I used to get squashed a lot in playing multiplayer strategic gaming. I was very aggressive, and while I'd successfully take territory and expand my boundaries, I'd get double or triple teamed. i'd get mad, but I eventually realized something.<P>The nail that sticks up highest is the first one to get hammered down.<P>Once I learned this, I became much much better in my gaming strategies.<P>I can see how people would be disappointed in the KAAOS actions - TCE wanted to see a war and battles go on; KAAOS wanted to level. For the more strategic view, supposedly (and trying to take a zone line can be very painful without an overwhelming force, or support from the other side.)<P>However, unless there is a concerted powerleveling effort, expecting to reach the high levels soon, I am not sure the leveling process for strategic advantage is important - if you are switching from EQ to Shadowbane. And if Shadowbane comes out anytime in the near future :)<P>I myself am willing to admit - I'm NOT an experienced PvPer in MMORPG environments. I have played plenty of head to head games of other varieties, so I'm no stranger to opposing other players - but I also realize that MMORPG environs are quite different; I'm not completely clueless, but I'm certainly no expert, yet, either.<P>Since I'm a casual player, and there is no way I'm reaching high levels before SB comes out, i'm more interested in getting into battles now, to refine my skills. Of course, not everyone is like that, and some people are leveling fast and hard.<P>What are the chances you will max out in the "strategic" levels before SB comes out? I guess that depends on when SB comes out, and how heavily you are playing.<P>I'm going to sacrifice leveling for PvP time, if I can get it; I need the skill polishing before SB comes out.<P>I can appreciate strategic decisions; but, between the (what would seem like) temporary nature of many of us remaining in EQ, and the fact that EQ is a persistant world, rather than a game where, once eliminated, its game over for you, I would think that the occasional excursion would relieve some of the EQ leveling boredom.<P>no offense, I am not trying to insult; I do understand the strategic points you make; it also seems kinda boring, and typical of bluebie server mentality, especially considering how most of us will be jumping ship for SB. I mean, isn't thats what the bluebie servers are all about, leveling like mad? The idea of PvP was supposed to change things - and maybe, at the high levels, it does, but it sure seems boring.<P>I guess if you are going to be playing at the higher levels, it makes sense. Not fighting at a zone line that would have to be taken, that would also make sense. But not fighting, at all, but leveling like mad instead - are you planning on playing long enough for that to be worthwhile?<P>I dont think low level pvp is invalid, though; you beat down a foe, he has more to work up to. If you have as many foes as you suggest, then doing it at low level or high level wont matter, the numbers would comparitively be the same.<P>Too bad we dont get xp for PKing other people; that would certainly make things much more interesting. Can't wait for Shadowbane.

Ahh, I wasnt really planning on coming back to check on this conversation but seeing as it has carried on so far...<P>Im a gamer. I play for keeps. This includes but not limited to MMORPGS. Knowing what that is I begin to see why you have all gathered as a guild. It seems the only way you can derive pleasure from playing is by being on top and winning constantly. This is really just a personal player choice. Personally, I get my kicks out of "living on the edge" in games. I cant tell you how many times I ran head long into a dozen members of a warring guild in UO in hopes of luring one out to pk. This is how I get "satisfaction", escaping near misses and taking the tough kills.<P>In UO it was all about numbers, preparations, connection and organization. In EQ its about lvls and numbers. Considerably more simple than UO was IMHO but still requiring a measure of skill nonetheless. In Shadowbane we dont really know what will matter most, we can assume but not know. My point is that the tactics you used in other games will obviously not apply to SB. <P>Which bring me to my next point... Since when did the MMORPG God deem you guys the facilitators of "the guilds that matter"? You have never fought TCE. You have never grouped with TCE. You have never warred TCE. You have never even so much as taken part with us in a raid (not that there has been any from us on SZ yet.) Who are you to say who matters? You say we are nothing. We say we are a guild to be reckoned with. Whos opinion matters more? Neither. There has been NO (none, nadda, zilch, zinc, zippo) confrontations in which to prove eithers point. So come off your high horse and face that fact that we are no longer vapor. We are guiled, just as you are, on a PvP server. We are no more vapor than you in any way shape or form. We are no more or less important than you in any way shape or form.<P>In conclusion, get over yourselves.<P>-Rek<P>Wanna call me a newb? Come prove it. Words count for nothing.<BR>

To be honest I'm disappointed with the lack of PvP so far on this server, TZ was much more ambitious starting out.  I almost feel like I'm playing a bluebie server, which makes me wonder why I'm not playing with my RL friends on Fennin instead.<P>I'm not because TCE has a chance to play a game together in decent numbers, and there is a *possiblity* albeit unfortunately slim, that we will get a chance to PvP as a team.  Everytime I have engaged in PvP on SZ so far it has been by myself or helping out an anonymous ally who's getting picked on.  Every single time the enemy has run away and opted to zone rather than deal with the consequences of their actions.<P>PvP will be much less restricted and much more rewarding in SB, so hopefully these same problems won't persist there.  I never had any hope of EQ being a great PvP stage but for now it's the only thing in which we can gather together in numbers.  Personally, I'm not going to even hope of participating in this level 50+ PvP game of server domination KAAOS is striving for, because if SB isn't at least out in my beta stage by then I will have had my fill of what SZ has to offer nevertheless.  I don't think anyone in TCE is planning for that either.  That said, it as though we are playing 2 entirely different games, and 2 entirely different strategies just make sense for what we are trying to achieve.  In SB I see where KAAOS' SZ strategy would be good for just about any war-minded guild planning to stick it out for the long-haul there, hampered only by the fact that none of us will know SB's advancement process nearly as well as EQ's.<P>This argument over nutsacks and strategy is pointless.  One is not better than the other; our strategies match our goals.  They both suit both our needs, that's what a strategy is used for.

You cannot debate, you have shown no desire or ability to PvP. I know exactly how you survived in UO. Always gathering the larger force and recalling whenever you were the slightest bit outnumbered. That does not make you good, it makes you weak. Winning in EQ and UO means little, its all a respawn game. No territory, no final victories.

Your words are as weak as your knowledge. I assure you I am not behind the "curve" of lvls on SZ, nor will I be in SB. But that doesnt really matter, your just gonna end up dirt beneath my heal when the non-factors stab you in the back while your too busy concentrating on those you deem important. Ill be there to watch it, count on that.<P>-Rek

I don't understand.  You claim you will be leveling up fast so you can "control" the high-level loot-filled zones.  Can you explain the mechanics of how this will work?<P>You think "The Planes" that you must have read about at Everlore will be a key domain?  You think your guild will be able to hold the Planes?  Unless there are over 200 level 50+ members in your guild that live in a geographically diverse pattern and can keep a presence of 40 people online all the time, you won't be 0wning the Planes.  If any concerted effort is made by another guild that is "worth your time," that guild WILL succeed in wrestling the zone away from you and most likely controlling it for long enough to get everything they need.<P>And what are the Planes nowadays?  Any good stuff you can get out of Velks, VP dragons, etc etc etc, leaves Planar gear in the dust.  There are, simply put, too many regions full of good loot for you to be a "dominating force" in EverQuest.  And the game is only getting bigger.<P>Anyway, the best resist jewelry is Craft-made, not camped.  So you're not stopping anybody from getting their resistances up.  No other stats really matter in PvP, 'cept maybe AC.  Spells can be pharmed anyplace.  Epics aren't worthwhile.  Extra mana is nice, but not necessary if your team play is good and you have C2 cast on you.<P>The game you seem to be playing is just a harder bluebie EQ.  You are playing the exact same game that exists on the other servers, except for the destinction that you can be killed and ejected from your hunting area by other players who want it.<P>Why are you on Sullon?  Go to Quellious, there aren't any "gnats" there and you'll enjoy yourself more.  You can get into nice civil duels to solve arguements, and there will be no interruption in your leveling by rowdy Newts.<P>Honestly.  I hope you don't carry this mindset over to Shadowbane.  Because in Shadowbane, the only area worth "dominating" is your own fortress, and you can't do that very well if you spend all your time leveling. :-/

Man, your just not getting it are you.  This aint about shadowbane.  This is about Everquest on the SZ server.  Everquest is ALL about levels and equipment, not about lowbie wars in east commons, you can keep that shit.  Im sure theres some more guilds yer calibur you can war with, just go into nek and listen for the " NEWBIE101 guild is starting up and needs recruits" shouts and youll find some opponents more your level.<P>Rann SoulRender<BR>KAAOS

Wow, Rann, you managed to not respond to a damn thing I said, aside from restating what I was contesting.<P>Can I have a response from someone worth my time?

Allow me to explain the whole plains dominance theory:<P>In Hedron's unofficial words:<P>"Let's level until we're all uber, and if anyone asks why we refuse to fight any wars, we'll tell them that we intend to dominate the planes.  Ok guys?  Alright, go!"<P>The dominating the planes argument is the biggest fucking line of shit I've ever heard.  It's an excuse, and a poor one to those of us that have actually played PvP servers in the past.<P>I hear Fennin Ro has festivals and stuff, perhaps KAAOS should check it out?<BR>

Amusing, isn't it?<P>Watching the premier guild of murder cower like this?<P>All the name calling in the world won't destroy the simple fact that you refuse to accept our challenge.  <P>Oh, yes, I forgot, we're gimps.  So smack us down already.  Pile our corpses at our spawn points until we bow before your might.<P>As of now it looks like you flaming cowards talk tough, use a bunch of pretty, fancy, hoopty dooty words to cover the underlying truth "You will not war us out of fear."<P>Yes, Hedron the Shephard has laid his law and said "TCE is not good enough", meanwhile hiding under his bed.  Of course, his sheep, the rest of you, follow his lead without stopping to question the truth behind his cowardice.<P>If we are such an easy target, destroy us.  <P>Lemme guess, it doesn't fit into your powergaming scheme?  In Shadowbane will you ask us to leave you alone?<P>In EQ you can ignore our war request.  In Shadowbane you will not be able to.  You will be fighting us in Shadowbane (Well, judging by the patterns of this guild, you'll run to a weak server with weak guilds and prance around saying "They're gimps, hahahahhahahah!", meanwhile never fighting, but posting your dominance here on the forums nice and safe from any real threat.<P>War us posers.  Worst case scenerio, we can only knock your arses back down to level 5, no biggy.<P>

When it comes to Shadowbane, my bets are on no established guild, or guild that thinks it's established, making its way to uberness.<P>That's the nature of the beast for me. There's no way to tell who's going to come out on top, though of course I have a few that I suspect will make it. I'm keeping their identities close to the vest right now.<P>That said, I plan to be very open and honest about my original picks and pans, AFTER the game's out and some observable in-game conflict happens. Win, lose or draw, that's what will be most interesting to me. Board politics are not, and will never be.<P>It's a sad day when someone makes a KAAOSer seem reasonable, but Trueblade, you are a piece of work. :) Everyone in KAAOS has been amusedly dismissive, but you seem to want, nay, demand, tribute for what you perceive as a travesty: the idea that a certain guild won't fight against other low-levelers.<P>I'm now more apt to root for KAAOS just it'll be funnier to see this thread shoved back in your face. But for now, this is EQ, and I really could care less what happens there now. What I hope most about Shadowbane, besides the interest and sheer fun factor, is that it doesn't take me days, weeks, months of repetitive actions to do anything interesting or fun.<P>J.<BR>damned vulpine<BR><a href="http://sb.warcry.com/" target="_blank">http://sb.warcry.com/</a>
