          <blockquote>
          Martin Irontip had served his beloved All-Father for many years. He had served the Holy Church without fear, an icon of purity and faith, just as a Crusader should. This humble servent of the righteous has unfalteringly served in many crusades and led his own soldiers into countless battles for the glory of the Creator. However time has not pased over this soul without taking it's own toll, though still a vicious warrior who's wrath is feared by all, he grows weary of the constant battles. Martin's health slowly wanned as did his fury and his battle prowess. This was to be his last mission, he was to escort the current regeant of the holy church and his family across the Burning Waste. A simple enough task, upon his return he would be retired as a saint.<P>Though the caravan had a way to go until they reached the actual desert the climate was almost unbearably hot. Martin hated travelling this last part of the wilderness, it's harsh gorges and jagged rock formations scattered with outcroppings of trees and other flora made the area a perfect setting for an ambush. Knowing night would soon take them Martin gave the order for his men to set up camp, five of the fifteen were to alternate guard duties that night.<P>Martin knew this cursed place was home to many dangers, yet he was unaware of the hazard in the the dark clad figure who had been following, silently and unseen.<P>Early into the first wacth one of the younger soldiers assigned guard duty heard a slight sound off toward the back of the camp. He watched the blackness a long time before dismissing it as nothing more than an animal, or perhaps a fallen branch. If no one else had heard the sound it couldn't possibly be a threat. Another sound reached the guard's ears, a light twang seemingly far off. Drawing his blade the young knight crept cautiously into the dark,  the last mistake fate would allow this warrior. Where the men of the righteous were quite incapable of functioning in the blakc night, Nemesis was acustomed to it. He lived the darkness, it was his proper home.<P>Nem stealthilty carried the two corpses back several yards, just to the border of the worn trail. Carefully placing them there to lay on the ground, an arrow in the chest of one, throat of the younger sliced deeply, flapping open and shut, dark liquid dripping onto the sandy dirt as the carcass was transported. This was the Nemesis' favorite tactics, he could harry his prey for days on end, slowly picking at their numbers one by one.<P>The cavalcade's losses were not noted until the morning's light, the company being awakened by the paniced scream of a knight who had found Nem's cleverly placed gift. After a brief investigation and a short delay for reflection Martin had come to a decision as to what actions will be taken. They had uncovered a set of footprints that seemed to lead right off of the trail, up a short slope and into the wilderness, next to where the remains of their friends were found. It was the decision that they would follow these footprints and rid themselves of the culprit right then. Eight of the remaining thirteen sought out the scoundrel, Martin and the other four stood by to protect the cargo. It was also decided that the high prelate, his wife and his daughter were not to be told of this event. Causing fear would be most  unnecesary Irontip reasoned.<P>Hours had gone by since the eight had left. Just as Martin began to suspect something foul, a loud crash was heard from a ways off the trail, as he looked up a headless cadaver came tumbling down, one of his own. Obviously the group had indeed come across the very cur that they sought to find, it was a trick all along.<P> Suppressing his own feelings of apprehension and dismay, Martin barked out the order for the remaining knights to ready their arms. Two of his four last soldiers were to flee, taking the high saint and his company with them. Martin and the others were to hold back and delay the pursuer, giving their care as much distance from the threat as possible.<P>Uneasy silence occupied the air as the crusader and his two companions waited there, watching the caravan  slowly fade out of view over a rise ahead on the trail. Every second semed like an eternity, the tension built and the warriors did not know how much longer they could stand there. They had no idea what to do in such an impossible situation.<P>Two sharp thumping sounds followed by a cold gurgling came from Martin's left. Looking toward the commotion he found another one of his warriors slumped over in his saddle, one arrow jammed in his throat and the other through his head. He studied another one of his dead men, the bone of his skull splintered in a bright red gore, a dark blood bubbled out of the gaping wound inflicted to his jugular.<P>Just an instant later a flurry of motion shot clear over Martin, he spun around to his right side to see a shadow descend upon and over take his last knight. Before Irontip could act Nem had discarded the corpse to the ground and taken flight after the caravan, the horse being pushed with what seemed like infinite speed. Martin readied his sword again and pounded his heels into the haunches of his own mount, chasing frantically after Nem.<P>Martin knew these breathes to be his last. He came over the rise and stopped there in his tracks as he beheld the caravan halted. The beasts that had pulled the wagon both lay dead along with the last of his unit and their mounts. Those figures haplessly scattered across the coarse dirt which was now drenched in blood.<P>His shroud was a dark color, the mix of complete darkness tinged with a deep red, this once was property of a malign order of priests who live no more. Covered from head to foot, most of his ashen face hidden within the hood of his cloak. Nem stood there by the rear end of the wagon, motionless. Martin knew what the figure was waiting for. Martin slowly dismounted gripping the pommel of his shank as he  nervously paced toward Nemesis. <P>The swift killer closes the distance between them, fluidly gliding across the ground, Martin thrust his blade forward, following through with a long upward arc. Nem seemlessly floated through the attack and it appeared almost as though he passed straight through Martin himself, stopping on the other side of him. Martin turned around to face him, Nem's back still turned. He raised his sword almost as if he was to make a second attempt, at that moment the seering pain gripped at his heart. His weapon dropped  to the ground and he fell to his knees. Martin Irontip soon lay on his side trembling, realizing he was already slain. A razor sharp dagger already having sliced deep into his heart, entering his chest cavity just below his armpit.<P>Nem entered the stagnant caravan to find the family huddled together, absolutely terrified. A smirk gradually drew across his visage. The quaking members slowly looked up, tears streaming down their face as they knew they were caught. The shade reached out and with a swift wrist movement snapped the neck of the mother, leaving the daughter sitting on the ground hysterical. The mortified priest rose from his seat, Nemesis' reaction was instantaneous. He pinned the high priest to the wall of the coach, holding the holy one by the throat with an icy grip. His words then came slowly and clearly, "You may leave this place alive, providing I get to watch you take your own daughter's life. Refuse this offer and you will only watch her suffer in the worst imaginable ways just before I end both of your lives." After a moment of pitiful wimpers the priest fell to his knees and nodded in agreeance. Nem handed him the long twisted knife, watching in ecstacy as the pastor ended his own blood's life.<P>That holiest of the righteous could not talk when he found his way back to civilization. Far too afflicted with the anguish that haunted him from that night. He struggled at keeping his humanity just enough to eat, and drink for sustenance,for him there was no rest. Several weeks later he took his own life as he discovered his daughter's decayed hand wrapped in white silk on his pillow. Nemesis' wrath was inescapable and unrelenting.<P>A nemesis, the rival that cannot be beaten or overcome, the source of retribution and vengeance personified.
