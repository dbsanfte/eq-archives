1. Meridian isn't the only one on the Story Board, he's just the only Staff Writer (and he's the only one who's won a P&P RPG industry award for his work at Chaosium doing the Call of Cthulhu series.) Warden, Varios, Scorn, Arcane and Naarsin are also on the board (and maybe more, I forget.) 

2. You're still stuck in "fiction is meaningless" mode. Shadowbane plans to hire people as "feature characters" that will help direct the plot at one level or another. All the guild types, races, classes and disciplines are meant to reflect the story of a living world as much as to facilitate guild-on-guild warfare. It's supposed to matter.

3. The beta testers are half Americans and half Germans. Warden admitted to Erik the Red (as reported on SBVault) that quite a few of the testers are friends of theirs, but not all of them are.

4. Wolfpack has been notoriously late on their deadlines. Name me another game company that hasn't been. OSI shoved UO out the door. Blizzard held Diablo 2 back a whole year.

5. Wolfpack Studios has a total of 17 employees. The founders ran a company through three rounds of venture capital, business contracts and general profitability. They're working in the game industry, which is immensely imitative and in-bred, yet they've managed to get a buzz without spending a dime on marketing. The coloring contests are strictly fansite nonsense (and not MY fansite, mind you.)

6. Warden drives an SUV. Tacitus, one of the feature programmers, drives the same car he had when he moved to Austin from Kansas City, and apologized for the leaky back window when he drove me to 6th Street last November. To my knowledge, they have no company cars.

7. The guild names on the map were just ... guild names on a map. There's no big secret there.

8. You really need to count to 10 and calm the fuck down. :) You are one of several thousand people who want the same kinds of things from Shadowbane. Any guild that quits a game in favor of an unfinished game must either really hate the game it had been playing, or its members are really delusional.

The last beta tester for Shadowbane who "outed" himself to a friend got deluged with 50 e-mails in the span of 15 minutes, and probably will receive more. Small wonder no one wants anyone to know who they are.

Shadowbane will be, what it will be. That's all there is to say about it.
