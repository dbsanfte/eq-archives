<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">Faust asked me to post this here for him since
he cancelled his AOL account. I'll have to admit I'm pretty much in agreement
with him. I saw what ITB was when I first joined and saw what it was becoming

guild roughly 2 1/2 years ago until the game died, should know what I am
talking about.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
She's right, I'm WAY out of touch. I was under the impression that ITB
was an Evil guild full of uncompromising bad asses like Gawain, Lasher,
Cormyr, Silent, Bolt and all the other guys from our era. I didn't realize
what its turned into... I'll have to go get my wittle stuffy-huggie-bear
and sit by the fireside wi'v my bwankie and listen to Burl Ives tunes on
my hand crank music box and get huggies from my friends in the bond more
often.</FONT></P>

cried and spouted off when he didnt get his way. Ya wanna know his idea
of how this bond should deal with Arc's aspirations to lead the bond...here
it was...&quot;boot him make a web page defaming him&quot;.Gee, thats class.
&gt; &gt;<BR>
<BR>
Of course, this was within days Faust told me that if folks didnt see Smoke
as a good leader anymore that he would step in and take over Smoke's spot.Yes
Smoke, at the same time you saw him defending you, he tried to convince
me that HE should take over. &gt; &gt; Of course, that idea didnt fly,
and, when it did'nt, once again, he made his power play by trying to start
a little inner circle and bad mouthing Arcane, Teddi and myself every chance
he got. THAT'S a bond? Some non-existant self important pompous fool who
has'nt contributed squat to the guild in over two years, and goes around
bad mouthing folks who are currently running the guild, and, while acting
on one side to be the biggest supporter of Smoke on one hand, is, on the
other hand, suggesting that HE take over for a while? &gt; &gt; <BR>
<BR>
Me? Ya, I can be soft at times. Wanna know why? Cause...OOC...this is a
group of friends who are supposed to be having fun together.Thats about
it. FUN. Yes, we strive to be the best, and, to have inspire respect and
fear, but, running around playing little power games aint what it is about.
Folks say I &quot;Politic&quot;...well..maybe thats the way you see it,
I see it as peacemaking.After all, ya can be evil without being a jerk...but...those
who are natural jerks wouldnt understand that. &gt; &gt;<BR>
<BR>
Tell ya what folks, let the people decied this one, cause I for one am
not going to put up with being slammed, and having two good friends who
have done everything they can to promote the guild be back stabbed, by
someone who calls these kinds of actions the way of &quot;The Bond&quot;

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">&quot;One of the problems that some of us older
ITB's had was that the bulk of the posts made by KAAOS members in the last
few months were right on the money. The fact of the matter was, we WERE
in bad shape and everyone knew it. Its pretty difficult to be as cocky
as an ITB should be when you have to turn tail and run from the public
boards. The only thing most of COULD do is just look for the comedy factor
and post about that. It also helped that Neurosis effectively reduced the
overall credibility of KAAOS so much.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Kaaos might have had better stats from PvP competitions and so forth
but ITB had NW staffers!... I always wondered who thought THAT was so cool?&quot;
&quot;At one time we had to have a secret group of members within the ITB's
called the Inner Circle. Pretty much the only reason we had this group
was to keep the NW Staff members who were ITB's out of ITB's business.
When Skorp became GM and an NW Staffer in the same month, he tried to shut
down the Inner Circle. That was one of the main reasons why I left the
game for a year... I came back when Skorp wasn't GM again... I didn't like
NW Staff running ITB&quot; <BR>
<BR>
&quot;I don't know most of the younger members but I did have occasion
to fight one or two of them when I came back. I wanted to see if they were
up to snuff. Some were quite good but most of them I kicked up down and
sideways around a PvP... it was really disgusting how very bad their skills
were, and I was so rusty I was a little disgusted with MYSELF most the
time. What really popped my gaskets was when I got handed some Email from
the SAME guy I kicked the crap out of and he's trying to organize a revolt
and throw us Elder types out! When I heard that he did it after getting
advice from Skorp, it was Inner Circle time all over again.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
&quot;I still think that there are about 80 members on the ITB roster.
I don't think that 1/2 of them even know that NWN is shut down yet. They
might have valid AOL accounts but they never read thier mail or participated
in any way. Such was the admissions policy of ITB in the latter months,
I guess. ::shrug::&quot; <BR>
<BR>
&quot;I feel kinda sorry for Skorp even if he is trying to disparage my
name and kick me out of ITB for stating my feelings on the matter. Its
like he's the last guy standing in NWN and can't realize that its time
to pack it up and move on... Its got to be hard on him. He's given his
everything to be &quot;somebody&quot; and worked hard for a company that
ended up folding up and throwing him out on the street. He'll never be
able to be &quot;somebody&quot; in another game. Nobody respects a guy
that sells out his guild to AOL staff, gets freaked out if someone criticizes
him about it, and cannot let go of a DOS 386 16 color game. They might
pity him but, he'll never get the respect he thinks he deserves.&quot;

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">Look at your last letter - calling a former friend
one of the most paranoid people you have ever met? Please, drop the personal
stuff and get to the point: you don't like the way the guild leadership
has handled things. Fine. But because people don't cowtow to you and your
demands does not warrant a verbal lashing by you. If you were really interested
in this bond, you would be working to strengthen the bond, and not creating
more inner guild bashing. Since when has negativity gotten anyone anywhere?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">Let's be honest here - I heard the only reason

How can you say this is between you and Skorp when you post it for all

Go out there and have some fun. If you feel the need to bash, bash on people
outside of this guild. But if causing problems for your friends within
this guild is your kinda fun, then please leave.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">I can't even figure out who the hell to send this
too or what I ever hope to accomplish by sending it.... but here's what's
going on with my head these days.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">I've taken great amusement of Skorps unraveling
just lately but it is somewhat sad as well. My posts concerning feelings
about ITB's internal strife and its ability to survive a move to Ultima
Online were, IMHO, professional assessments of a situation inwhich I am
directly involved. The Arcane situation was NOT handled properly IMHO and
Skorp himself told me it would rend ITB to an unreparable state. I'm afraid
that they only added to the truth of the matter when Skorp went ballistic.
It was replied to by Teddi stating that she wants everyone to just get
along and ignore any troubles we've had or will have and I noted that that
post took several personal swipes at me as well. She stated that I was
out of touch and didn't know what I was talking about. These same feelings
sound almost a direct quote from several of Skorps posts and emails of
the weeks previous.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">I replied to Onyx stating that I was tired and
sick of being a little pussy of a House ITB that used to be tough. Skorp
chased Onyx off right away. So much for Onyx, right? He crossed Skorp and
you can't do that in ITB, right? I then received ICQ message from skorp
inwhich he called me an &quot;asshole&quot;, told me to &quot;fuck off&quot;,
etc. yes, he's quite the peacemaker isn't he. I didn't save these and didn't
even read several but I assure you they were considerably less than lucid
and you could almost hear the foam dripping from his muzzle as he screamed
and yelled.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">He then forwarded me a note calling my more names
and within the forwarded note/post he twisted every action I'd been involved
in for the past few months. Saying that I told him that many members might
not feel that Smoke was the best leader (Do you think that this was news
to Smoke?), that I was asked to take control for a while (a thought forwarded
to me from Master AND Cormyr independently AND reviewed with Smoke). He
even outlined Arcanes actions as &quot;letting us know he was interested
in a leadership position&quot;. Rather than the reality of the situation,
a forcible overthrow that was outlined in the email we intercepted. He
threatened (yet again) to quit if (this time) I wasn't booted out of the
guild. HE CALLED FOR THE VOTE TO HAVE ME BOOTED, NOT I. All this heaped
on me for saying anything to the effect of ITB's shortcomings. I'm not
innocent of being an Evil backstabber... but who doesn't know that? Skorp
is pretty well known as a backstabber as well, are we not Chaotic Evil?
He then continued to send ICQ messages yelling and screaming at me. To
this point, I have turned off his ability to send me ICQ messages because
they just continued to get more and more ridiculous. In the last one I
sent to him I asked what the parliamentary procedure would be for an Elder
to kick another Elder out. He replied that although several of the older
and more official members of ITB would back me (he made a list) he &quot;had
all the footies and mercs&quot; and he would drop us and take them. I'm
still wondering where he began thinking that ITB had suddenly become a
democratic guild.... I also, had had enough. He is now summarily &quot;ignored&quot;.
It occurred to me that there is nothing Skorp would want more than for
me to quit. I am one of the few people who have been around enough to know
when something is bullshit and I'm one of the fewer people around that
will call him on it! Once he gets rid of me and a few others he can command
and redefine ITB all he wants... THIS is what pisses me off... he will
be riding on the hard work and reputation built by several of my better
friends and yes, even myself. He can stand around and laud the praises
of ITB but the bulk of the people who built that house would not find it
a home any more... getting rid of me would allow him to forget that.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">In the meantime I chatted with several of my friends
who happen to be KAAOS. As you will recall I set up a working relationship
with KAAOS so that we could enter a new game and work together instead
of appart. Skorp put this down as a stupid idea but I'm working with them
already. At my request they kept the bulk of it off the boards but of late
I've told them I didn't care what they did. Skorps shown me his true face
and at times I wouldn't mind punching it out. I was actually impressed
with their restraint. I've been pissed, waiting for a call from Smoke and
had few who cared to even listen. (If you have not noticed, I'm still pretty
pissed)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">Then I ventured onto the Internet boards and see
that Skorp have been continuing to bash me and my actions. &quot;WTF have
you done for ITB lately? Heh!&quot; and some mention to my &quot;fat&quot;
lips (??) talking to &quot;anyone who would listen&quot;. In this case
my &quot;fat&quot; lips were talking to the only persons who WOULD listen,
my friends.... I've even talked to Skorp about my feelings but he doesn't
seem interested in what I have to say... my way is hard and means being
hard on people who cannot stand to the test... I've made suggestions and
commented on recommendations before, to members of ITB's leadership. In
each case Skorp and Teddi have basically shut down any idea I've had saying
that I didn't have a clue... well, look around you... you tell ME if I've
got a clue. I predicted that the personalities of the Bond would prohibit
it from future prosperity... I don't want to see who and what... just tell
me... are the personalities of ITB prohibiting its prosperity or no???</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">I don't have to remind everyone that Skorp has
been repeatedly upset and over reactive while the last days of NWN were
in progress. News of his continued exploits of yelling at people and then
logging, trying to bust previously &quot;good friends&quot; for hacking
and generally losing all senses of &quot;cool&quot; have pervaded those
of us who wonder aloud at such things (I hazard to say that I am a little
bit &quot;in touch&quot; despite Skorp's repeated mentions of my lack thereof).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">I personally think that I have been repeatedly
attacked by Skorp, he obviously thinks this is going both directions. I'll
admit, I am sorely tempted to knock his block off. I have been in constant
contact with Lilyth and she feels that Skorp is under the impression that
she is out to get him as well (this couldn't be farther from the truth
in her case). In my case, I will put up with the fight only to further
strengthen my own position.... I've never been one to back down from a
fight, even if it is only me that perceives that there is a fight to be
had. As Skorp continues to babble on with his threats and callous attacks
on people whom once called him friend it will become more and more obvious
that he has breached the ludicrous and the power plays are more about him
and his insecurity than they are about anyone else.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">He asked me if I was sorry that I &quot;fucked
with him&quot;. I responded that the only person I saw doing any fucking
was him, and it was a one man show. What can we do for Skorp to get him
to sit down and let someone else take the reigns? Is this guild run by
Skorp and Skorp alone? Is this ITB or is this something that started out
as ITB and now just uses its name? Hell, I don't want to take the reigns,
I've got something of my own going and I'm rather enjoying it, thank you.
But I've been a member of ITB for a long time. I refer to it as a positive
experience and people know that I am not a newbie because of my background
and experience with the guild. The staff of Origin seems to think so even
if younger members such as Monk don't show the least bit of respect for
me... they do. Seeing ITB crater because of one persons instability would
be a shame. Either we need to shut ITB down, or we need to quell this storm
of rediculousness. He's going off and creating personality issues that
are unwarranted and unneeded. He's, frankly, trying to manipulate the bond
in such a way as to rend all control from elected and respected members
be them old or new, they must conform to his will or suffer his abuse.
This is a time when cooler heads must take control. If I am correct about
my theories concerning ITB's inability's to find its way to a place as
complex and massive as UO then I will be correct about the reasoning behind
it... starting with personalities in battle with themselves.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">In Conclusion, yes I'm pissed. No, I don't think
NW staffers should have been allowed to run the guild (Skorp actually MADE
that rule). Yes, I think admissions was less than adequate in recent years
(I created the process btw). No, I don't think I'm ready to jump out there
and wave the ITB banner right now and No, I don't think being a cheerleader
equates to being a leader. Go ahead, scream bloody murder but what I've
done for ITB recently is NOT put up with the bullshit and frankly, some
of our members could use a role model in that department. You want to lock
us in a room until we solve it? Fine. But it will be bloody. As I've said,
I'm pissed off and I'm not going to kiss anyones ass because he tells me
to.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">Um Faust...</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">Take a pill. IF you remember correctly..this entire
mess started when you quit ITB on the ITB private boards, said you were
moving on, and, in your final post, proceeded to rip on me and others.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">My reply to your initial 7 paragraph post in which
you ripped on me was &quot; Ole Faustie, Pompous as ever&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">Then..you had Onyx post another post, ripping
on Teddi. Sorry,I'll take one &quot;ByeBye, You are a jerk&quot; post..but...continued
personal attacks on members of HOUSE ITB are not kewl.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">Yes, you are correct, I have shot down ever single
attempt at yours to gain the GM spot of ITB. I did it when you and I booted
Lich, I did it again when you tried to reform the inner circle (gee, thats
a great idea...lets further fractionalize the guild) and, finally, I did
it when you said that if folks thought SMoke was doing a bad job (during
the Arcane issue), that you should take over for 6 months or so.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">So, Obviously you hate me. Now. I have TRIED to
let this thing rest. However, your last post is such a perverse twist on
things, it is definitly worth commenting on.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">Yelling at people and logging? Yup, yer right,
I did that TWICE during the last couple of weeks...both times to Lilyth.Was
I yelling AT her? Nope,I was yelling TO her.See...Yelling AT someone is
when you are mad at them...yelling TO someone is when you are mad at something
else. Gee...um....anyone else remember me yelling AT them and logging?
If you do,please say so.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">Trying to bust ITB's hacking. Um...nope...name
some names Faustie or keep your vivid dreams to yourself. Actually, I was
quiet proud of how well the ITB's controlled their desires to experiment.Yes,
sorry Faust, I dont agree with hacking, and, if the system popped someone
in the dungeon for hacking, I would HAVE to bust them, but...LOL..I was
never much of a hacker hunter....as a matter of fact, I NEVER busted one
that the system didnt nail for me.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">Anyway...to wrap this up...sorry Faust, you can
post your opinion about anything anytime you want...but...when you go into
personally ripping ITB's...thats wrong.I do apologize for replying to your
original &quot;rip&quot; posts in like...but..I refuse to get further into
it anymore, as I told you yesterday when you e-mailed me at work (which
I ignored) and then ICQ'ed me with your demands that I get a petition of
ITB's together do some sorta weird power thing.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">Sorry...the time for unity is now...not further
messing around.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">And, welp...pretty much everyother ITB who has
posted has said the same thing.Rejoin the bond and work together or not...I'm
sure Smoke would rip up your resignation if you decide to retract your
resignation.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1><FONT COLOR="#00FF00">Report to Ultima: ITB (In The Bond)</FONT><FONT COLOR="#808000">
- My former home in Neverwinter and still a close tie. A group reputed
for Pkilling and exceptional organization in Neverwinter since its inception
in 1992. Massive organizational abilities and aggressive instincts give
these guys a reputation bar none in NWN communities. This guild can easily
operate on name alone and MOST of the Pkillers in the game pay a great
deal of attention to them. <BR>
<BR>
For several years the guild was essentially the monsters most challenging
to kill and people dreamed of one day either becoming or beating them.
Everyone (at one time) wanted to be an ITB and only the best could get
in. Once this policy changed the guild started going down hill. Currently
this guild is more concerned with internal strife involving a fight over
power and a lot of personnel problems concerning old leaders who cannot
give it up and young members who don't know the first thing about how to
run a guild. There are very good people here though. Exceptionally skill
and adaptive players. One is writing his own video game and that takes
all his time. The current GM (Guild Master) is a former truck driver who
used to show up in everyone's home town from time to time drawing us all
into a tight group of friends. Another former leader is so far up the butt
of all the current and former staffers in NW that he knows just about everything
about everyone.... he is, however, somewhat delusional about his popularity.&nbsp;(Ed.
note:&nbsp;ROFL!!) One is a staff member at Lucas Art's, a game manufacturer.<BR>
<BR>
Another proposed a revolt to throw out the 10 top (eldest) members a little
while ago sending the guild into a huge tailspin ending only because NWN
was announced as closing.<BR>
This situation prevails in the current mentality of the guild and divisions
are insufferable in such a group. Lots of these people (the guild membership)
are, in one way or another, being demoralized because of the internal strife
and, quite frankly, I don't see an end to it given the personalities involved.
As these people become more and more alienated they will begin to break
off and look for independent homes. I have notified every one of them that
despite previous political adversity I would make them at home in whatever
capacity possible here in UO. This might involve you and my &quot;team&quot;
or it might not, we'll wait and see what the individual wants. I feel I
should let you know that I will go way out of my way to assist any ITB
requesting my assistance (without breaking certain confidences of course)
No news concerning an &quot;official move&quot; to Ultima Online and they
might be going to another game anyway as NWN shuts down. </FONT></FONT></P>
