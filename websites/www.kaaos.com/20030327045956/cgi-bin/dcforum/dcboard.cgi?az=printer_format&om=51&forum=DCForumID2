Could the ghost of Neverwinter’s greatest executioner be in this wind?<P>This wind comes to a Chilling, Screaming halt over a mound of dirt strewn with rotting leaves.<P>The light dims and in earnest the wind begins again, circling over the mound, speaking through the motion.  “Arise Leader of Orcs.  Krypto will again demand your service.”  <P>Abruptly the wind ends and there is motion under the leaves.  Earth and mud begin to move, slowly turning, appearing to chew the leaves.  The dim light barely able to outline the foul creature rising from the putrid refuses under the mound.<P>The creature slowly makes itself up on all fours then, even slower, rising on its hind legs.  Finally stretching it’s forearms and claws to the sky, lightning strikes nearby and illuminates the creature.<BR>It throws it’s head back and…..<P>-snorts-<P><BR>Orc Leader<BR>God Krypto’s Henchman<BR></blockquote><hr><b><font size=2>Table of contents</font></b><hr>
