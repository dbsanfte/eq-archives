[i]”Would you have schooled me in PVP in NW, prolly. Would you have always done so.. maybe.”[/i]

There’s no maybe about it. 

[i]”And your "stages of development" they sound alot like Hedron's circles. Are you trying to make up for some of your own personal misgivings there? Trying to emulate someone you actually "worship"? Or are you going to tell me now that Hed got that shit from you, and you are the actual gaming guru and everyone else emulates you?”[/i]
 
I didn’t even know Hedron when I wrote that on the NWN message boards in AOL (which was probably around 3 years before Hedron’s article) and I doubt highly that Hedron even paid attention to it at the time, let alone “got that shit from me”. Also, they are two totally different topics. What I wrote is what I witnessed from a development standpoint of an NWN PvPer. When I wrote that originally I was hoping to wake some of the clueless fucks up so that we could get more competition. 

As with any generalities of course there were exceptions. Call the growth process whatever you want but the bottom line is there were “newbs”, “clueless fucks who thought they were the shit”, “PvPers who had potential but weren’t there yet”, “good PvPers”, “great PvPers” and “past their prime PvPers” and climbing the chain was a process. 

[i]”I used my time to have fun in the game, which is what I am sure we all did. Some people lived for being the very best in any one facet of the game, some used it as a chat room, some just sat at the banks/town center and did what ever the fuck they were doing. For you to sit here and tell me what the fuck you think I am because of how I decided to spend my time within NW is as arogant as thinking you were something special in NW combat.”[/i]

First of all, there was nothing special about it, I simply owned you and every other gimp like you. Call it arrogance if you want but I’m a realist and the reality of the times was exactly that. 

Secondly, what makes you think you know jack or shit about PvP? Let alone enough to challenge my knowledge of NWN PvP. You spent all your time stroking your pud, yay for you. I spent every waking moment PvPing, yay for me. I tell you what, when we have a discussion about pud stroking I will bow to your authority, until then STFU.

[i]”Do you think, even for a moment, that if NW had a player base of the tens of thousands of players that current games have today that you would have been able to be as dominant?”[/i]

I would hope not. I burn for the competition. This is why I love PvP and this is why I have such a disdain for PK. I could give a fuck about the kill, I live to compete. I take great pleasure in the competition and in completely dominating it. I don’t need to be the best. What I need is competition. If I entered a realm, that had some tactical and challenging PvP, for the first time and I was the worst of the worst I would be happy as a pig in shit because I’d have something to work towards and I’d have an ass load of challenging fights along the way. 

You made the posts calling me out, calling out my knowledge and skill of NWN PvP. Trying to twist the focus to a feel good “I play for fun whaa whaa whaa” is not gonna make me forget the reason we are having a discussion on this thread right now.
