                was the time when the old Gods walked the land and goodness consumed 
                the world that provided the backdrop for the birth of Azimer, 
                the prophesized God of the Kill. It was then that Hoar, the God 
                of revenge and retribution, walked the land causing mayhem and 
                madness wherever he went. As was foretold by whispers on the newly 
                forming wind of the world, Hoar happened upon the teenage daughter 
                of the king and ancestor of lord Nasher, whose arrogance and self-centeredness 
                was legendary even at her early age. She glanced at the god and 
                immediately insulted him as she would a commoner. Hoar's rage 
                was instant as he grabbed her by the hair and drug her back to 
                the labyrinth he called home. His methods of retribution were 
                direct and savage, peeling the skin from her milky white face 
                and burning the rest of her body beyond recognition. His magicks 
                ensured that she could never sleep or die, and in her ear she 
                heard over and over again the insult she had imparted to him, 
                a constant reminder of the price of insulting a god. Though her 
                body would be considered hideous and disfigured by most, Hoar 
                reveled in his work and would rape her fiercely two or three times 
                a day.</font></font></p>
              <p><font color="#999999">At first he was content with the blood 
                she oozed after a good cock fucking, but quickly became bored, 
                finding new ways to cause pain to this &quot;insulting cunt&quot; 
                as he called her. His experimentation with pincers, insects, and 
                vermin did not curb his appetite either, only when he discovered 
                barbed-wire did he truly become intrigued. He would wrap the wire 
                tightly around a long wooden shaft that he would fuck her with. 
                Jamming it up through her ass till it emerged from the mouth, 
                he would mercilessly slam it back and forth like a giant saw-toothed 
                dildo, eating the pieces of flesh as they were shredded from inside 
                her small lithe body. Held like a pig on a spit, her fuckings 
                were long and bloody to amuse the god.</font></p>
              <p><font color="#999999">After a few months, he grew tired of her 
                and gave her to the great mastiff he kept. She drug the woman 
                back to her den, but instead of killing and eating her, the bitch 
                sensed the woman was with child, even as she was pregnant. The 
                kindred spirit saved the woman who was fed and allowed to live 
                and grow the unborn child inside her. The day came that the child 
                god was ready to leave the womb and claim his birthright as a 
                god of the realms. I pushed up through the flesh barrier, ripping 
                her abdomen open and crawled away from the dying body. Immediately, 
                the bitch set upon the bloodied body of my mother whom I barely 
                even glanced at. There were four mastiff puppies in front of me 
                that I instantly recognized as rivals. I set upon them and with 
                tiny fingers wrapped about their neck did strangle the first 3 
                of the puppies. The last and largest looked at me and a bond was 
                instantly formed. In a glance, all was understood, that this hound 
                would be my companion throughout my life and I would be his master.</font></p>
              <p><font color="#999999">Suckling at the bitch sustained me as my 
                strength and powers grew. I read all of my hated father's grimoires, 
                even those that he was afraid to peruse himself because his mind 
                lacked the depth to comprehend them. Pulling my fathers obsidian 
                flail from the wall, I waited for him to return from his daily 
                entertainment. As he returned, covered in human blood, I swung 
                the flail hard, catching him by surprise, and imbedding the spikes 
                deep in his face. As the blood spurted from his eyes and ears, 
                I began a barrage of eldrich magic that began to tear his flesh 
                and sinew from his bones. I wrenched the flail free from his swollen 
                and bloody head and swung again, piercing the back of his skull. 
                He tried to counter attack, but his spells bounced harmlessly 
                off the protective magic I had conjured. Colder than ice and more 
                efficient than a butcher, I reached down his throat, grasped his 
                heart in my fist, and wrenched it from his body. As he died in 
                front of me, his heart in my hand, I spoke my only words to him. 
                &quot;REJOICE FATHER, FOR YOU HAVE BEEN BLESSED NOT ONCE, BUT 
                TWICE BEYOND THE DREAMS OF ANY BEING THAT HAS EVER EXISTED. YOU 
                HAVE SIRED A TRUE GOD, AND YOU ARE THE FIRST GOD TO DIE AT MY 
                HANDS. REJOICE, FOR YOUR PLACE IN HISTORY IS SECURE EVEN AS THE 
                LIFE ESSENCE FLOWS FROM YOUR BODY AND I CLAIM YOUR SOUL FOREVER!&quot; 
                His body collapsed and I hungrily devoured his still beating heart, 
                savoring the taste and feel of the kill.</font></p>
              <p><font color="#999999">Time passes and I spend most all my time 
                hunting down the old false gods of the realms and killing them. 
                Tyr, Midnight, Torm, Bane, Myrkul, and Helm are just a few of 
                the gods that fell to the obsidian flail and magics of the God 
                of the Kill. My every thought and fiber of my being became consumed 
                and focused on the art of the kill. After eons of perfecting my 
                craft and eliminating all the elder gods, I discovered that there 
                are other new gods that have existed even longer than myself. 
                They had named themselves the Gods of KAAOS, and I immediately 
                endeavored to join their ranks. The gods were kindred spirits 
                who reveled in the sheer nakedness of evil, scoffing at the pretenders 
                and the wannabes, and drinking deep of the nectar of vileness 
                that drives the world. I had found home.</font> </td>
