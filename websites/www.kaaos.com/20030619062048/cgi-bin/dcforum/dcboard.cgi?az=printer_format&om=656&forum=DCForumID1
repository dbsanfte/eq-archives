<blockquote>Planetside is not role play so I was wondering if it is worth playing, I like RP with strategy but I also like shoot em up games as well.<P>What made PS a choice with an evil RP guild? Is there enough ways to have an evil style with a game that has three factions?  That’s about it for now. Please list possible solutions to this predicament and repercussions to an evil guild playing a futuristic game with no blood. <img src="http://www.kaaos.com/htdocs/dcforum/Images/happy.gif"></blockquote><hr><b><font size=2>Table of contents</font></b><hr>

I find Planet Side very entertaining because of the pace of the game . Your right tho. I don't think you will find much time to RP in this game . There many ways to play. Does not matter if you cap bases or simply go around and destroy ememies generators . I would belive it is more of a play style choice . Me , im going to make level 20 , no doubt . Hide my ams , set deployable's and kill everyone that passes my check point ..<P>I'm just an ass like that , heh.

Ok we can see how it is sporting enough to kill people in a game, but where is the evil role when it is mainly just your job to kill for the team in Planetside? <P>We have three different views but no real labeling of evil factions vs good factions. You have a controlling faction which might be a good thing, free to do what you want faction which still might be a good thing, and an alien tech faction that wants to have in between. (whatever that means)

Having trouble answering my questions yet again. Thats ok I know your all only one step up from animals, we all can't be perfect. <P>Here is the question: Please list possible solutions to this predicament and repercussions to an evil guild playing a futuristic game with no blood.<P>Can't be evil and your team can't hold off a heavy invasion. True, you might be able to start hacking a base and pick off a few newbies; but you all lack the numbers yet again to defend without help and would have to pick up your fast ass and high tail out.<P>
