         <blockquote>
         &gt;Escape. <P>Never had much use for it. If Im going to die then it will be talking shit and face to face or face to faces. Id rather put up a fight, regardless of the odds, than piss my pants running for the nearest server line or zone border. Pathetic.<P>But then again, there is no shame in running before any fighting occurs. When you look up and find yourself alone somewhere - or get a bad feeling about a couple of players in the area - well, sometimes its good to get the hell outta dodge. Because once the fighting starts - well, that changes things.<P>&gt;One of the most important things <BR>&gt;about playing EQ on Rallos <BR>&gt;was the location of the  nearest zone line,<P>Yeah, your right about that. You had to kill the lamer gunning for that boundary if you wanted your prize - once they got to that line, turn off their comp and they disappear forever. So knowledge of where that existed was extremely important because 90% of the time attacking someone made them run straight for it. Though - I really have to admit as much as I bitched and moaned about those boundaries and the spineless players who escaped me through it...there was no better pleasure than watching the severly wounded walk and crawl those last few feet to escape and then dieing inches from it. <P>The good ole days =)<P>&gt;There was just <BR>&gt;no way to escape, you <BR>&gt;had to win or die, <BR>&gt;sometimes if you lived long <BR>&gt;enough MOBs would give up.<P>Wait.. is this the Everquest KAAOS forum? Bleh. Not to be a total jerk - we don't know much about the monster AI except that they will have different strategies, triggers, and reactions. Still, in an unregulated PvP world, MOB strategies should always be approached from a group perspective. Its not the Mob you need to worry about, its the two strange players you dont know who have suddenly taken an interest in you being alone and what not. When PvP is king, you should never solo a monster that you have a chance of dieing to - or either barely beating with heavy personal damage. Most players wont be that careful or think that way, which is kind of sad. But then again its not totally unexpected - several hundred still die each year from sticking car keys into electrical outlets or playing golf in lightning storms.<P>&gt;But in a <BR>&gt;PvP situation that's not going <BR>&gt;to happen. <P>Good. The idea is promoting conflict. Easy levelling, inexpensive equipment, item bonding etc etc. There wont be an easy escape - especially for the lazy. Awareness of your surroundings, preparation for attack, pre planned escape routes and meticulous attention to hitpoints, mana, etc save more lives than server boundaries ever could. But its hard to do and it takes work - which is why most people don't do it. Some are just born to be victims I guess. <P>Even with the best laid plans - your still going to die a lot. That percentage of death/escape/victory will rise or fall based on how carefully you spend your hours online. In UO you could be ganked in a second to a group - but there were still ways to be better prepared. In EQ, well you had to really be dumb IMO to get ganked - it was just too damn easy to escape.<P>&gt;I fear that SB will fall <BR>&gt;into this trap, especially for <BR>&gt;slow moving races and melee <BR>&gt;types. <P>Its not a trap. There will be unbalances sure. But WP has said that they will work to fix major unbalances although things will never be fully equal - and I dont think it should be. Sometimes a good offense is the best defense - and if that fails, well just dont leave town with less than 10 in a group. 10 dumb hyenas can still take down a single lion.
