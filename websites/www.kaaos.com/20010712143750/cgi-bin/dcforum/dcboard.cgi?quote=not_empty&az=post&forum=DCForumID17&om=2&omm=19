         <blockquote>
         &gt;I want to see <BR>&gt;a history of the work <BR>&gt;experience that each member of <BR>&gt;Wolfpack has, kinda like what <BR>&gt;J posted up. I'd like <BR>&gt;to know what other MMORPGS <BR>&gt;or games in general that <BR>&gt;they have played so that <BR>&gt;I know what influences will <BR>&gt;be on the game.<P>Off the top of my head:<P>Josef "Arcane" Hall, president of Wolfpack, co-lead programmer, author of the Arcane3D Engine. Don't know what games he's played, but he was the one to merge DikuMUD and CircleMUD code to form the codebase for ChaosMUD.<P>J. Todd "Warden" Coleman, VP of marketing for WP, producer and big-picture idea man for SB. Purports to have 15 years of MUD development experience, has played UO and EQ, didn't like either of them, though he understands why EQ was so popular, "it's a freakin' DikuMUD." His concepts for SB were partly borrowed from ChaosMUD, which he was a worldbuilder and wizard on, and influenced by Norse mythology and the Elric of Melnibone series by Michael Moorcock. After leaving his first crappy job, he got Arcane to build the alpha of DCSL, which he sold through Reliant Data, when he was its CTO.<P>Robert "Naarsin" Marsa. Has only appeared in two interviews, to my knowledge, so I don't know much about him, other than he has a PhD in physics from U of Texas-Austin, and looks like the white version of Chris Rock. CTO of Wolfpack, 'catch-all' programmer for Shadowbane, has his hand in everything. Was a programmer at Reliant Data, and would only come on board at Wolfpack if they were committed to a Mac version of Shadowbane. He only programs on Macs.<P>N. Patrick "Varios" Blanton, VP of product design for WP and lead designer for SB. He sees his role as designer as breaking down Warden & Co.'s large concepts into whatever cannot be broken. Was notoriously good at locating bugs in MUDs he was playing and working on. Has known Warden since middle school. Played UO early on, quit early, notorious powergamer who "plays to win," but would rather Shadowbane not be a PK's paradise.<P>Jeff "Ashton Kai" Toney, 3D artist, did most of the early building models, heavily influenced by Middle Eastern architecture and culture, did most of the Irekei stuff. Former t-shirt designer who was working on a game called Shadowpact when he met the founding members of Wolfpack; Shadowpact's development studio shut down before the game shipped, and he jumped ship to Wolfpack. The world's nicest man in person, with some very dark interests, he's impossible to annoy and easy to amuse.<P>Billy "Hezrael" Arnold, 3D artist, did most of the character models and clothes, especially the early stuff. Worked for several published titles, mostly console stuff. Reportedly yanked Derek "Windfeather" Sanderson, UO2 designer, out by the collar when he entered Wolfpack's trailer at E3 to get a peek at their demo. Do not piss this man off; I know by experience.<P>Everett "Belthior" Lee, character animator. Old-school UO player who keeps his former identity guarded, but from what I know, he hung with the hard-core, RP and PK, most of which probably didn't know he was doing both at the time. One of the most obnoxious players Warden's ever known -- one of the primary design imperatives for SB has been to make it "Varios- and Belthior-proof."<P>Toby "Tacitus" Ford, feature programmer, did many of the area effects and is reportedly working on the Shadowbane Player, the thingy that records in-game action. Hired straight out of U of Missouri-Kansas City, he impressed Naarsin with his posts to an apple.com mailing list for OpenGL programmers, and had a Tekken clone for MacOS half-finished when he joined Wolfpack.<P>Sean "Ashen Temper" Dahlberg, internet relations manager. Marine Corps sergeant who landed a job developing and supporting commercial Web sites on contract at a SoCal outfit, procured the earliest versions of the "shared dev board" message sites for Shadowbane, recruited to run Shadowvault, which later hooked up with IGN. Very prominent in both UO and EQ, playing evil female characters (LdyDeath on Pacific, <a href="http://express.stratics.com/credits/kallystra.htm" target="_blank">Kallystra</a> on Rallos Zek.)<P>James "Scorn" Nance, content director. Worked on ChaosMUD with Arcane, Warden and Varios, was an investor for Reliant Data and Wolfpack before they hired him full-time. Has a strong IT background of which I'm fuzzy, though he was also one of the founders of bike.com, which was recently featured on fuckedcompany.com. Apparently knows how to dodge bullets pretty well.<P>Thomas K.A. "Dreadflame" Sitch, feature programmer, scary individual. Never played a MMOG and never worked on a commercial computer game before working at Wolfpack, his previous job was at the Institute for Brain Dementia at U of California at Irvine, where he programmed models for Alzheimer's research. Ran the Web site for the local Camarilla LARP group out of Orange County, called The Black Magic Kingdom, was picked out of a crowd at E3 and introduced to Wolfpack.<P>Tre "Soulphage" Zieman, 3D artist. Previous job was at Acclaim's Austin office, where he did models for the Turok and Quarterback Club series, now is in charge of all the swamp stuff in Shadowbane, among other things.<P>Sam "Meridian" Johnson, staff writer. Has known Warden and Varios since middle school, won at least one industry award for his gameplay modules for the Chaosium series, Call of Cthulhu. Has written out just about everything of length on classes, races, disciplines and legends in Shadowbane. Shadowbania.com launched with a great interview with him yesterday. Sings baritone with the U. of Texas Madrigal Dinner Singers.<P>Kevin "Eiss" Saunders, feature programmer. Hired straight out of Utah State U., where he programmed robots for experimental AI movement. Guess what he's doing for Shadowbane?<P>Keith "Zyzebo" Brewer, "online rollout director," according to the beta press release, though he was hired as a contract database consultant. Worked with Arcane, Warden and Naarsin at Reliant Data, is a member of Brotherhood of Crimson Knights (www.bck.org). And no, he hasn't told them anything, to their consternation. I already asked.<P>Chuck “Arjuna” Fleming and Scott “Lazslo” Wietterschneider, programmer and 3D artist, respectively, of which I know very very little, except Lazslo did the Bearkin monster model, and used to work for EA.<P>Any more questions? :)<P>J.<BR>damned vulpine<BR><a href="http://sb.xrgaming.net/" target="_blank">http://sb.xrgaming.net/</a>
