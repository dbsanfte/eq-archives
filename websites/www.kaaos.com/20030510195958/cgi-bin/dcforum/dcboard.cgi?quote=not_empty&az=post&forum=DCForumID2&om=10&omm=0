         3/10/2000<P>Darkness crashed.<P>It must have been the darkness crashing, because there was nothing else to crash.<P>Darkness doesn't crash.<P>This darkness crashed.<P>The air was cold.  It had that bite that invigorates the skin, and yet is not enough to go beneath.  The clean draw of cold in through the nose that wakes up the lungs.  The hard edged feel of cold that makes even vision sharpen.<P>And the darkness crashed.  It crashed like ocean waves before a hurricane - continuous, enfolding, unhesitating, powerful, inescapable.  One long crash that was like falling forward and never hitting the ground - but expecting to... waiting to... wanting to...<P>It was a rhythm that swept the hammering of your heart along like a partner in a wild and throbbing dance.<P>The moon was clear, hard and bright - like the cold in the air.  Its light invaded the snow among the trees, cutting through the leafless branches and falling hard upon the ground.  It enriched the world with high-lights, and complicated the darkness by cutting it into pieces that vibrated in place, want to join together into a complete blanket of lightlessness.<P>It was most definitely the darkness that crashed.  Only the darkness could crash so quietly loud.  Only the darkness could be the swelling of mayhem and corruption and chaos and yet be nothing at the same time.<P>Hedron stood stock still and inhaled it all into himself on the backs of the shreds of cold air that he pulled in.  As the darkness vibrated, so did he.  Or perhaps as he vibrated, so did the darkness.  It was hard to tell which one was the aggressor.<P>Hedron did not move.  His tendons and bones lay locked in a stone-like immobility.  His jaw was clenched in a rock-like solidity.<P>This tableau of crashing darkness, biting cold, and hard edged moonlight was like a painting brushed down around The False Prophet.  Or at least that was how he felt.  And he was unsure whether he should move.  He knew that if he moved this crystalline image around him would break.  He did not want it to break.  He felt it closing in around him, denying him the ability to move.  He felt it close around his arms, his legs, his throat, his belly... and now he knew that it was closing in around his eyes.  And yet still he would not move.  This... "painting" made him feel alive on the surface, even as it closed around him tighter and tighter.  And he felt a devotion to it.  A devotion that would not allow him to break it.<P>Each time it drew tighter, though, another piece of the darkness would come into contact with him.  And as soon as it did, it would begin to crash.  Hedron held himself as still as he could.  Not still enough, not still enough, not still enough.  He vibrated with the inner energy that threatened to smash everything around him.  And as the painting tried to still that vibration, it instead began to shake and shiver with it.<P>Time was all it took.  Time brought the darkness to vibrate.  And vibration brought the darkness to crash.  And crashing brought the snow and the ice and the trees and the cold and the moonlight and the air... brought all of it to destruction.<P>The darkness crashed, and with it crashed the world.  And in the end all that stood was The False Prophet.  Jaw still clenched, muscles still frozen, with every fiber of his being still vibrating with that tremor that destroyed everything around him.<P>He wanted to weep for the loss, but he could not.  He wanted to devastate the darkness for crashing, but he could not.  He wanted to deny the painting had existed.  He knew he could do that.  But he would not.<P>Slowly, he moved.  His body drifted forward in a place with no direction.  His jaw loosened.  After a time his mind released its tension, swept out and embraced the darkness as his own.<P>Once again he knew what he had always known.  Nothing nothing nothing lasts.  Except himself and his memory of the things he had destroyed.<P>Somewhere in the darkness crouched the figure of a woman.  She had fallen into shards of crystal when everything else had.  But unlike the rest, for her, in the darkness an afterimage glowed and persisted.  When Hedron closed his eyes, he saw her.  Each time he closed his eyes, her image was dimmer than the last time.<P>He lifted the twisted cross, closed his eyes, and slashed its filthy metal through the image of the woman, tearing it like paper.  The torn edges of her soul fluttered in the darkness until she was absorbed into the twisted cross wholly and completely.<P>His eyes opened, and for a moment he stood there blinking.  In the nothingness, he planted the twisted cross like a headstone into the space before him.  Slowly he walked away.  When the soul of the woman had bled from the cross and into the soil of darkness, he would return for it.  Until then it would stay here.  And he would not.<P>The darkness crashed as he walked away.<P><BR>Hedron<BR><a href="http://www.kaaos.com/hedron/falseprophet.htm" target="_blank">The False Prophet</a><BR><a href="http://www.kaaos.com" target="_blank">KAAOS</a><P>...No child, don't cry.  Your tears only boil away on the Twisted Cross.  It's your blood that soaks in deep.  Your blood...<P><a href="http://www.kaaos.com/hedron/6circles.htm" target="_blank">The 6 Circles</a><BR>
