</FONT></FONT><FONT COLOR="#C0C0C0">- The god damn pit. The center of hell.
The evil boiling in the hidden chamber of the heart that doesn't show up
in any x-ray. <BR>
<BR>
</FONT><B><FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><FONT SIZE=+1>KAAOS</FONT></FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#C0C0C0">
is a seething pot of blood. Gods and Goddesses are dropped into it on a
fucking thread that breaks as they hit the surface. You fucking sink or
swim, bitch. Sink or fucking swim. <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=+1>W</FONT>hat's that mean? </FONT><B><FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><FONT SIZE=+1>GOD
DAMMIT!</FONT></FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#C0C0C0"> It means if you want to
be a god you better not buckle. I mean you better not fucking buckle. Not
to anyone in the realms. If someone is in your face, you're in his. No,
let me clarify. If someone is in your face, you rip your face off and pour
blood all over his body before you decimate him like a balloon full of
shit blasted apart by ten tons of </FONT><B><FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><FONT SIZE=+1>KAAOS</FONT></FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#C0C0C0">
Salsa pumped out in a ten ton Godload. <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=+1>B</FONT>ut what if another </FONT><B><FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><FONT SIZE=+1>KAAOSER</FONT></FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#C0C0C0">
is in your face? Well you better walk careful. Walk careful, but you better
not buckle. I mean you better not fucking buckle. <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=+1>S</FONT>o what's to be careful of there? Sounds like the
same old bullshit over again... and you're reaching for your face to rip
it off... and you're loading up the Salsa Engine. <BR>
<BR>
</FONT><B><FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><FONT SIZE=+1>I SAID WALK CAREFUL.</FONT></FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#C0C0C0">
Walk careful because you're sitting across from somebody who's about to
rip off their own face, and </FONT><B><FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><FONT SIZE=+1>KAAOS</FONT></FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#C0C0C0">
has the kind of skull you don't wanna see. <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=+1>B</FONT>ut what the fuck, man? We're a guild. Aren't we supposed
to be nice to each other? </FONT><B><FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><FONT SIZE=+1>FUCK&nbsp;NO!</FONT></FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#C0C0C0">
We hack and slash at each other as much as at anyone else. But the new
gods... if you drench the new gods in blood and cut them open, then all
you're left with is a sagging empty balloon of human skin. <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=+1>T</FONT>hat's ok. This is </FONT><B><FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><FONT SIZE=+1>KAAOS</FONT></FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#C0C0C0">.
That's what we specialize in. As you elder gods sit across from those struggling
to rise to godhood, and you slice them apart, you're feeling the evil course
through your veins. </FONT><B><FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><FONT SIZE=+1>FUCK
YEAH!</FONT></FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#C0C0C0"> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=+1>B</FONT>ut ask yourselves, as you raise that knife to slice
the skin off that bullshit pissant newbie god, &quot;If this one doesn't
bleed... if it doesn't bleed a drop, but instead raises its own knife to
strike me&quot;, what then? <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=+1>L</FONT>ike tigers, you gang of fucking rapists, we eat our
young. We smash them in our teeth and pick them out later. But I'll tell
you, when I lift a child god into the air and tear a pound of flesh from
the naked child-god's back, I watch it. And when I see it stand, shake
off the pain, and tear an ounce of flesh out of my leg, </FONT><B><FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><FONT SIZE=+1>THAT,</FONT></FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#C0C0C0">
gods and godesses, is a fucking </FONT><B><FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><FONT SIZE=+1>GOD</FONT></FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#C0C0C0">
ready to be discovered. I kick it to the side and leave to blossom into
pure evil. <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=+1>T</FONT>hat child god is one I want to see grow up and tear
a pound of flesh out of </FONT><B><FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><FONT SIZE=+1>HIS</FONT></FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#C0C0C0">
children. The ones that mew like kittens and roll away to slowly bleed
and pout, are the ones I smash beneath my boot...they can get the fuck
out. <BR>

for evil is there. </FONT><B><FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><FONT SIZE=+1>PvP</FONT></FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#C0C0C0">
finese comes as long as the underlying talent for evil is there. What </FONT><B><FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><FONT SIZE=+1>NEVER</FONT></FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#C0C0C0">
shows later is the heart of evil, the cunning of death, and the pulse of
a god. If a child god has all these, then it will grow into a true god
in all ways. Stop looking for ready-made posters and killers. <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=+1>T</FONT>hose ready-mades only show that at some point they
learned to post, at some point they learned to </FONT><B><FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><FONT SIZE=+1>PvP</FONT></FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#C0C0C0">,
and then they came to us like a moth to a flame. They knew where the real
evil was. They knew where they could tear the skin off their brethren,
crack his bones like a twig, and have that mother fucker enjoy it. But
were they born to it? Will they revel in the blood, or only play at evil
for a time? The real ones... the ones born to it, they are few and far
between. Take them as they are, hurt them, torture them, but let them live.
One day they too shall be gods.<BR>
