"Someone posted a ways back that God existed (or was it god? -- i forget) anyway it existed and had since the beginning of time. You then
                                                 referred us to history for proof.
</p>
<p>
            Next, referring us once more to history for proof, you deny the existence of a devil(s), hell, heaven, and whatever ... 
</p>
<p>
 Well -- history doesn't prove much here. What history (or is it archaeology? anthropology? ahh nm) proves, as a matter of fact, is that there
  have been and still are many different stories and legends about omnipotent beings. Sometimes they are evil and sometimes they are good
                          and so what? There is, however, no proof. Isn't that what the whole debate is about? 
</p>
<p>
  So, by checking history for proof and finding none, I could well assume that god, devils, evil, and/or good, exist in the mind of the beholder,
  i.e. God exists because I say it does. There are a lot of philosophical writings to support this argument as well and no I'm not going to go dig
                   them out. (however -- if a tree falls in the woods and there is no one there to hear it does it exist?) 
</p>
<p>
 Okay, so I say Hedron is a god -- who are you to dispute me? You can say Hedron (shall I refer to him as Mr. H for your peace of mind?) isn't
  a god in your mind -- but that does not invalidate his godhood in mine. I'd use Affrica for this discussion but I'm not sure it wouldn't offend
                                       her and besides -- using Hedron is more fun ::snicker::
<p>
                                            Now thats OOC, if you want IC...well <G>
</p>
<p>
    IC I can make up anything I want. Given that Neverwinter itself is a made up idea (i.e. a story -- a place that we all recognize as being
 fictional) and that roleplay is encouraged here, I can insert anything I want to into the storyline and my story is as valid as yours.  I can even
       offer proof positive (within the roleplaying aspects of Neverwinter) that gods and goddesses make up the membership of Kaaos. 
</p>
<p>
  1) Should proficiency at PVP designate godhood on individuals and/or guilds, then the members of Kaaos consistently hold the number one
 spot in every PVP competion in the realms. I'm not saying they are there all the time -- so don't go pull out all the times they've been in the
 number 2 or ::shudder:: number 3 spot and use that to refute this. What I am saying is that Kaaos as a guild and the individual members of
                        KAAOS consistently place into the top 5 in every single competition held in Neverwinter.
</p>
<p>
 2) Should proficiency at roleplaying designate godhood on individuals and/or guilds then Kaaos has consistently roleplayed a very evil guild in
                                                Neverwinter for a very long time.
</p>
<p>
 3) Should popularity count as proof of godhood, then there are many folks that would give their right, um.. well they would like to join Kaaos.
  Not only that, people will humiliate themselves publicly, will perform acts of a um, well they will do stuff that they wouldn't ordinarily do to
get into the guild. Go look at some of the collages on their web page if you feel the need to disagree. People work to get into this guild -- it is a
                                                       very popular one.
</p>
<p>
  4) Should good postings designate godhood on a guild and/or individuals then some of the members of Kaaos are some of the best posters in
  the realms. Not everyone -- but there are enough. That post from Hedron about a month ago definitely came from the mind of a god. If you
                                      don't like his postings though -- go round up Xylina<G>
</p>
<p>
 5) To steal a point from the sockdude, you can call worship anything you want. Does this post you are reading now constitute worship? I'll tell
           you what -- I'll make it easy on you. I worship Kaaos. There. Now if you need worship to be a god then they've got it. 
</p>
<p>
                                 There you go. Proof that the members of Kaaos are indeed, dieties."
