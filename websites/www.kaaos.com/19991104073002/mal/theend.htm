From: Da Hangman </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF"><FONT SIZE=+1>All throughout the lands of Neverwinter,
the cries of those in pain could be heard. Even the tortured souls of children
moaned and screeched. But amidst the cries of pain and anguish, the sounds
of anger rose much higher.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF"><FONT SIZE=+1>The people of NeverWinter, despite
being harassed by the Nazi rule under the Hitler-like leader, NW Snowie,
were fighting back. What did they have to lose? Their homes had already
been compromised. Even before the loss of their homes, the secret raids
of the uncaring gestapo NW agents took place.. No, NW had not gotten better
with time...it had gotten worse. </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF"><FONT SIZE=+1>Luckily these people who were willing
to fight until the end, these very people whom were like a family to each
other.. they became better and they grew stronger. Whether it be in NeverWinter
or elsewhere.. these people would thrive. Well, as long as KAAOS allowed
them to, at least.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Amidst the chaos and anarchy, KAAOS
was always there. <BR>
KAAOS will always be there. <BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">Amidst the Gestapo... even in these realms
controlled by NW Hitler, KAAOS will always thrive. The lands change, even
the faces change.. but the power is always there. </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF"><FONT SIZE=+1>Whether it be hacking SUSANs and
WARRs... whether it be House ITB and their festering cesspool of mediocrity...
whether it be stupid ass, fucking Nors and other assorted goodies, yelling
their gay as hell battle cries.... KAAOS will always be there kicking your
asses. </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><FONT SIZE=+1>KAAOS OWNS YOU! <BR>
KAAOS KILLED YOU HERE. <BR>
KAAOS BEAT THE FUCK OUT OF YOU IN NW. <BR>
KAAOS WILL BEAT THE FUCK OUT OF YOU IN ULTIMA. <BR>
THERE IS NO ESCAPE.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF"><FONT SIZE=+1>So, now, I bid you farewell. Many
faces will be missed... Many faces will stay the same.. those of you who
separated yourselves from the wusses and pussies of the realms, you will
be remembered... the rest of you will be forgotten or laughed it. Thus
is the way of the Gods.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF"><FONT SIZE=+1>However, before the curtain closes...
let us take a look around the realms and see what is going on.... Here
are a few choice scenes you may wish to look at and remember.. or block
out and repress.</FONT> </FONT>
<HR WIDTH="100%"></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#00FF00"><FONT SIZE=+1>Synopsis: We have the scene of NW
Lethe and NW Kishpa, two gestapo agents. Both are anal and bleed from their
asses, daily. </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=+1>Imagine, if you will, NW Lethe strapping
on her 14 inch strap-on cock and pounding the hell out of NW Kishpa. Imagine
Kishpa squeeling like a pig as his stretched asshole was violated by Lethe's
massive tool, yelling &quot;Red Vette, save me!&quot; And then having her
bitch slap him in response. A cute picture, eh? Perhaps it was Kishpa's
pussy it was pounding in and out of, who knows with him?</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=+1>I'd like to bid a farewell to those
two plus all of the assorted sluts and other fucking anal losers who played
this game and lived in our realms. Good riddance.</FONT></FONT>

From: Da Hangman </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF"><FONT SIZE=+1>On a brighter side however.. let
us look in on the KAAOS Hell Hole. With blood strewn everywhere, gore hanging
from every crevice.. this is where the unity was. Not only did KAAOS boast
the best PvPers.. but KAAOS boasted the least bullshit. Either be kewl
or get the fuck out. Simple as that.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF"><FONT SIZE=+1>Synopsis : The last few weeks in
the KAAOS Hell Hole.. party!! Celebrating their 2nd straight WPC&nbsp;Guilds
Championship and their 10th WPC&nbsp;PVP&nbsp;Champion, the gods PARTY!</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">Story : Amongst the dimly lit corridors

in his arms as he toasted the rest of his fellow Gods. It was a party for
the end of these realms.. with promises of better and greater things to
come. <BR>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#00FF00">The rest of the Gods all laughed and downed
their Soul Spritzers.</FONT><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"> <BR>
Bayberie and her AGM God </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Ego Prime</FONT><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">,
huddled off in the corner, celebrating in their own way.. Ego was getting
laid for the first time in centuries! <BR>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">War Knight</FONT><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"> stood
off to the side, three kegs of ale next to him, one lifted above his head
as he threated to beat the hell out of the small </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Frytz
Gryn</FONT><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">. <BR>
The ghost of </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Doc Krypto</FONT><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">

</FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Malhavok</FONT><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"> and
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Slayve</FONT><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"> stood
in drunken stupors, blindly swinging at each other, yet never coming in
contact with one another.&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Slayve smacked Mal with his PVP&nbsp;titles
and everything was cool between them.<BR>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Ku Uaki </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">was running
around the Hot Tub yelling, &quot;What the flock is going on, my negro
amigos?!?!&quot; <BR>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Dark Aura</FONT><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"> laid

busy eating the corn out of someone's shit. <BR>

</FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Noquar</FONT><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"> had a
Polar bear dick in his mouth at first, then switched positions and climbed
on top of his furry friend. <BR>

</FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Azimer</FONT><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"> had some
Chinese wench hanging on his Quads championship belt, but was too busy
eating some rice to notice. <BR>

gangbanging Strappmee again, pounding her ass from both ends.<BR>
The ghost of </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Doomers</FONT><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">

his long nose in a few of the Goddesses.<BR>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Feebinator </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">was
in meditation with the corpse of </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Cendrick

it were dripping some sort of white liquid.<BR>
The ghost of </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Psykill </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">was

having fantasies about fighter jets.<BR>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Fat Kid </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">was sucking
the thick, white creme out of some Ding Dongs. <BR>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Kyle Bain</FONT><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"> was
prophecising about the death of everyone and trying to sound like Hedron.
<BR>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Pirate </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">was busy
with his wife, </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Lady Pirate</FONT><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">..
both of them taking turns fucking their newborn son. </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Lascivia</FONT><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">

was of course, yelling &quot;WUSS!&quot;&nbsp;and &quot;PEON!&quot; whilst
trying to get people to remember he WAS&nbsp;in KAAOS, in hopes of being

for his personal cab driver, Juan.<BR>
