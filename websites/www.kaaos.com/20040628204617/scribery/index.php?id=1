                                  would make no one rich, but the fight promised 
                                  to be exciting. The bloodthirsty Longsaddle 
                                  crowd quieted as Xylina of KAAOS approached, 
                                  followed soon after by Lilyth of House ITB.</font></P>

                                  echoed a knight.</font></P>
                                <P><font size="-1">With that, the two warrior 
                                  women tossed their felines to the ground. Xylina's 
                                  black Persian crouched low, waiting and watching, 
                                  watching and waiting. Lilyth's tabby circled 
                                  warily, a low whine rumbling in her throat. 
                                  The crowd roared when the Persian pounced, claws 
                                  extended, and the fight started in earnest. 
                                  Coins were exchanged again when Xylina's Persian 
                                  seemed to choke and gag, allowing Lil's tabby 
                                  to pin her to the ground. Suddenly, the Persian 
                                  coughed up a hairball, frantically scratched 
                                  her hind legs at the tabby's belly, and broke 
                                  free! She pounced again! Fur was flying everywhere!

                                  of claws and teeth, bouncing across the ground, 
                                  locked in a battle to the death. Xylina's fingers 
                                  knotted into tense fists as she tried to catch 
                                  the black flashes of her cat, while Lil watched 
                                  the fight in concentration, knowing her tabby 
                                  was on it's ninth life. Then, suddenly, there 
                                  was a sickening _snap!_.... and it was all over.

                                  bloodied paws. Xylina narrowed her eyes, gave 
                                  a smirk that paled the faces of the spectators, 
                                  and collected her winnings. The knight frowned 
                                  at the leering mage. &quot;Well,&quot; the knight 
                                  said, shaking his head and handing over the 
                                  wagered gold, &quot;guess you were right....

                                  I called him so willingly. I looked into his 
                                  eyes and i licked my lips softly trying to get 
                                  some mostiure there. His eyes searched my face 
                                  and I smiled at him. He leaned over me and kissed 
                                  me softly his lips caressing mine softly. I 
                                  placed my arms around his neck and pulled him 
                                  onto me fully wanting to feel his weight upon 
                                  me. </font></P>

                                  I moaned softly opening my lips to him. his 
                                  tongue darting in to taste me. His hands caressing 
                                  my body. Sliding over my stomach and up caressing 
                                  the curve of my breast. I moaned again at his 
                                  touch. His ended the kiss then and looked me 
                                  in the eyes...</font></P>

                                  &quot; I looked into his eyes and I melted. 
                                  his hand sliding lower still now and at my things 
                                  he slapped them softly telling me softly &quot;&quot;Open

                                  what he had done to me. I looked into his eyes 
                                  then and I blushed.</font></P>
                                <P><font size="-1">Suddenly he turned me over 
                                  and pushed me into the soft fur of his bed and 
                                  held me tight with one hand. I couldn't see 
                                  anything, but I was too excited to be afraid.</font></P>
                                <P><font size="-1">I felt him then...as he caressed 
                                  me from behind... I raised slightly up and offered 
                                  myself to him.. wanting it and needing it as 
                                  I had never before...he took me then hard and 
                                  fast... his hands tightening in my hair pulling 
                                  me back against him....My back arched back towards 
                                  him as he claimed me as his then... making me

                                  lately. I've been trying to find most of the 
                                  guilds that you've been talking about and get 
                                  some info on them. And after a few dayz of searching, 
                                  here's my hit list of the really, really bad 
                                  guilds. (BTW, I've found all these guilds' internet 
                                  addresses. That's the primary way of how I found 
                                  out about them, aside from all the chat that 
                                  y'all have made :)</font></P>
                                <P><font size="-1">1. KAAOS- By far the nastiest 
                                  guild out there. They talk about death &amp; 
                                  mutilation as if it was an ok thing. Add in 
                                  all the pentagrams &amp; blood in their web 
                                  page and you got a guild that can make almost 
                                  any decent person sick. This guild has got to 
                                  go.</font></P>

                                  they do is try to ruin someone's fun. They need

                                  views about Death Matches. KAAOS is attributed 
                                  with really starting the phrase and determining 
                                  what its meaning is. Generally its a fight to 
                                  the death between the two participants with 
                                  the loser deleting his screen name. Usually 
                                  these fights occur inside the Death Match Area 
                                  in the Triboar Arena, but people have been known 
                                  to change the location because of the wimpy 
                                  monsters that are at that fight. Just because 
                                  you go into the DM Area of the Arena does not 
                                  mean that you are doing a Death Match (although 
                                  if you die and dont CAD you will have to reroll). 
                                  Rules about fight etiquite and the fact that 
                                  the loser will delete are always stated up front 
                                  so there is no confusion. This happened with 
                                  Dreamforge and a KAAOS'er, he never stated the 
                                  fight was a delete fight so he didn't, period. 
                                  I don't know what the circumstances of Mich's 
                                  fight were but appearently he is deleting ;/</font></P>

                                  vs. KAAOS we were bugs. It happens. KAAOS is 
                                  one of the top PVP guilds in the game, if not 
                                  the best ever. Note I said PVP guild. Respectwise, 
                                  I will take KORT's reputation over theirs anyday. 
                                  We did our best and lost. The Pages and Squires 
                                  who participated should be commended. But we 
                                  lost as KORT, not as a bunch of foul-mouthed

                                <P><font size="-1">When we were matched against 
                                  KAAOS, it was clear that we'd certainly lose. 
                                  They really are some of the best. The surprise 
                                  was not losing but being crushed so decisively. 
                                  It was a truly frustrating couple hours when 
                                  we couldn't hardly accomplish anything. Truth 
                                  be told, it's just not normal for Quad fights 
                                  to end in 5 or 6 rounds. Perhaps we were disorganized, 
                                  perhaps we didn't fight well as teams... but 
                                  it's hard to tell when two of your team members 
                                  punt right away, or if everyone's held within 
                                  three rounds. Even the smartest PvPer around 
                                  can't demonstrate much strategy in three rounds 
                                  while outnumbered. So I really don't have anything 
                                  to say about our teamwork. </font>

                                  she grimaced. The infant Goddess knew no pain, 
                                  but the environment wasn't aiding her in getting 
                                  to her destination quickly.</font></P>
                                <P><font size="-1">Balanced herself on her feet. 
                                  Wobbled. Crashed to her hands and knees. She 
                                  scowled, as she had been graced with the intelligence 
                                  of a Goddess at birth, but certainly not the 
                                  dexterity. Standing again, she held onto the 
                                  wall and scurried along it...the need to feed 
                                  drove her to the secret entryway that led to 
                                  Kal's compoud. A simple incantation muttered, 
                                  and the door unlatched with an almost silent 
                                  ::click::.</font></P>

                                  had received from him the night before. Her 
                                  loud snores were somewhat annoying, but the 
                                  simple irritation was overlooked; Dratsaba eyed 
                                  the two incongruent, petite feeders hanging 
                                  loosely from Silver's chest.</font></P>

                                  she thought, as she climbed up onto the ornately 
                                  fashioned bed dressings. She eyed a swollen 
                                  aperature, and realized Kal must have already 
                                  abused that one. It was the one she chose. She 
                                  latched on and started to feed. </font></P>
                                <P><font size="-1">Silver slipped a sleepy eye 
                                  open, and very quickly understood what was going

                                  Dratsaba, and had she not bitten down at that 
                                  precise moment, she may very well have flown 
                                  across the room. </font></P>

                                  she screamed, but Dratsaba had the power to 
                                  extract lactation from anything. The colostrum, 
                                  followed by sweet milk, flowed like a river.</font></P>

                                  she was looking for. It wasn't lumpy, it wasn't 
                                  rotten, and it disgusted her. </font></P>
                                <P><font size="-1">&quot;Don't you know that Ahlora's

                                  Silver snapped, and Dratsaba let go of her feeder.</font></P>

                                  be able to stomach the bland flavor of an ordinary 
                                  brew.&quot; Dratsaba informed her, and Silvers 
                                  shining eyes looked deep in thought. </font></P>
                                <P><font size="-1">&quot;Yes, yes....I suppose 
                                  you're right, little one...&quot; Silver conceded, 
                                  and her voice trailed off. </font></P>
                                <P><font size="-1">Silver rolled over to go back

                                  and walked right out of the room, as if she'd 
                                  been walking for years. The toddler Goddess 
                                  headed towards Ahloras quarters, as it was time 
                                  for a treat.</font></P>

                                <P><font size="-1">Report to Ultima: ITB (In The 
                                  Bond) - My former home in Neverwinter and still 
                                  a close tie. A group reputed for Pkilling and 
                                  exceptional organization in Neverwinter since 
                                  its inception in 1992. Massive organizational 
                                  abilities and aggressive instincts give these 
                                  guys a reputation bar none in NWN communities. 
                                  This guild can easily operate on name alone 
                                  and MOST of the Pkillers in the game pay a great 
                                  deal of attention to them. <BR>
                                  <BR>
                                  For several years the guild was essentially 
                                  the monsters most challenging to kill and people 
                                  dreamed of one day either becoming or beating 
                                  them. Everyone (at one time) wanted to be an 
                                  ITB and only the best could get in. Once this 
                                  policy changed the guild started going down 
                                  hill. Currently this guild is more concerned 
                                  with internal strife involving a fight over 
                                  power and a lot of personnel problems concerning 
                                  old leaders who cannot give it up and young 
                                  members who don't know the first thing about 
                                  how to run a guild. There are very good people 
                                  here though. Exceptionally skill and adaptive 
                                  players. One is writing his own video game and 
                                  that takes all his time. The current GM (Guild 
                                  Master) is a former truck driver who used to 
                                  show up in everyone's home town from time to 
                                  time drawing us all into a tight group of friends. 
                                  Another former leader is so far up the butt 
                                  of all the current and former staffers in NW 
                                  that he knows just about everything about everyone.... 
                                  he is, however, somewhat delusional about his 
                                  popularity.&nbsp;(Ed. note:&nbsp;ROFL!!) One 
                                  is a staff member at Lucas Art's, a game manufacturer.<BR>
                                  <BR>
                                  Another proposed a revolt to throw out the 10 
                                  top (eldest) members a little while ago sending 
                                  the guild into a huge tailspin ending only because 
                                  NWN was announced as closing.<BR>
                                  This situation prevails in the current mentality 
                                  of the guild and divisions are insufferable 
                                  in such a group. Lots of these people (the guild 
                                  membership) are, in one way or another, being 
                                  demoralized because of the internal strife and, 
                                  quite frankly, I don't see an end to it given 
                                  the personalities involved. As these people 
                                  become more and more alienated they will begin 
                                  to break off and look for independent homes. 
                                  I have notified every one of them that despite 
                                  previous political adversity I would make them 
                                  at home in whatever capacity possible here in 
                                  UO. This might involve you and my &quot;team&quot; 
                                  or it might not, we'll wait and see what the 
                                  individual wants. I feel I should let you know 
                                  that I will go way out of my way to assist any 
                                  ITB requesting my assistance (without breaking 
                                  certain confidences of course) No news concerning 
                                  an &quot;official move&quot; to Ultima Online 
                                  and they might be going to another game anyway

                                  as i hate to admit this.....the best webpage 
                                  for a guild is HANDS DOWN, KAAOS. What can i 
                                  say, i dont like evils, but their webpage RAWKS! 
                                  It even made me kinda wish i was in KAAOS.......LOL

                                  one of the only pages i can actually stand going
