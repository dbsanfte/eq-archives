         <blockquote>
         Several thoughts:<P>1) NwN may have been the progenitor of much online gaming... but in no way was it perfect.  The game was what it was... and it was never intended to be a PvP game, it just mutated into it... because there was nothing else to do.  And other than some pretty massive lies about a next generation... there was NOBODY listening when the player whined.<P>2) Put that guy up there with Thyrm, Hedron, and 3 other guys and you'd possibly cream everyone for a while but the others would become capable soon (or get a hold of the third party program ::clears throat::) and soon those big ego's would split into political backstabbing and hyjinx... which is the point of Shadowbane.<P>3) It may turn out that a Rogue/WereRat/BountyHunter kicks ass against casters in general... but other than a few exceptions... lots of us don't dream at night about being a R/Wb/Bh (I don't at least) so a lot of us will be looking for the anti-R/Wb/Bh and, given all the variables presented in Shadowbane's set-up... there will be a lot of experimentation.<P>4) Those groups that have time to do the experimentation will have the jump on the others so there IS a place for the 24/7 crowd.  Not to mention the 24/7 crowd that collect assets which go into he defense (or offence) with regard to Tree of Live protection/destruction infrastructures.<P>5) Wide variety of skills = many variables = specialists in each variables = Web Sites devoted to the specialties (e.g. Rogue Werebears) = experts in specialties (e.g. those that read those boards) = Difficult to write a manual for all this = Newbies have a hard time understanding the complexities = Not so fun for Newbies = Not so "massive" game population-wise = not so much income for WolfPack BUT a tighter and close knit society of existing players.<P>6) Although its been said that you can max relatively quickly, you'll only have 5 Characters per account and can only play one at a time.  However, some of us have 4 or more machines at our house (we have a member with 5 accounts in EQ running at all times) which might make up for the low population account wise... but the point is, it will take a relatively diverse bunch of specialists to make a successful guild.   Successful guild will need to keep their successful strategies pro<P>7) Given the variety of playing styles, the variety of professions, skills, base classes, and even variety of armor's capabilities... (ala some stuff defends against bashing better than piercing... some the other way around... etc etc) There are going to be a huge pile of possible situations which will not ALL be possible to test... then add the human factor and it will be a real mess to keep track of.  I believe that WolfPack is designing a game which will intentionally be fraught with chaos and diversity.  Some things will work, many wont.  I wonder how the nerfing or adjustments will go... <P>(that's enough thinking for one day)<P>In UO we bitched that they released the game without testing it enough... In EQ we bitched because the game design was too limiting.... I wonder what we'll bitch about in Shadowbane. <P>~f<P>
