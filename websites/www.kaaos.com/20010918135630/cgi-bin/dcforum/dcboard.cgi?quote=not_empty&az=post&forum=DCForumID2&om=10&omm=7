         <blockquote>
         <BR>Betrayal is a hard thing to take.  Some days it wrenches at your guts, and others it just rests there, nestled among your insides but not stirring.  You can almost forget it's there.  Until it moves again.<P>It's as though it's a knife.  It slides into your chest - it slices through your skin, quietly sneaks between the bones of your rib, and finally eases its way into your heart.<P>But it's so sharp you don't feel it.  Instead it just seems like motion... unseen, barely felt motion in your organs.  But oh, it's a knife.  There's no mistaking that, because when betrayal comes out of its cocoon, and metamorphs into it's final form... well, it's inside of you when it does that.  And that knife is jerked and pulled, hacking through you.  Some of the cuts are razor-clean, others are jagged and torn.<P>I had been betrayed.  I am forced to face that.  But even now, it's a hard thing to accept.  The worst part about betrayal is that despite all the parts of you that hurt and bleed, there is some other pitiful piece of you that wants desparately to have never been betrayed.  Whatever the cost of that denial, that is what it wants.  How futile.<P>When I think about removing the knife, this piece of me... it cries out, and clutches at the knife, driving it deeper by fractions into my heart.  It refuses to let go of it.  It has failed to recognize the knife for what it is, and it seems at times that it never will.<P>Of course that doesn't stop me from knowing that I have a knife in my chest... a dancing macabre knife.  It just leaves me in a position where there is nothing I can do about it.<P>I feel the tears on my cheeks. They're both warm and cool.  They soothe me as they drag me deeper into the things that cause them.  They are --- foreign.  And it seems I cannot contemplate them without either the most intense of angers, or the most detached of emotionless analysis.  Anger was earlier... now I was thinking again... endlessly.<P>She had helped me build a world, and then it had fallen.  She had fallen.  We had built it, and she had said she wanted it, and believed in it, and was part of it - that it would endure.<P>More.  She had said that the world... was only a world... that it was me above all that she was a part of, and I had said that it was her above all that I was a part of.  THAT was the commitment that rang out with purity and force.  THAT was the whisper that covered the sound of the blade sliding into my chest.<P>THAT was the lie.  I know that she lied to me.  I suspect that she lied to herself.  But apparently, I was more taken in by her deceptions than she was.  How naive.  How... mortal.<P>I feel my hand itching for the Twisted Cross... clutching at air as though to draw power from the weapon that I do not carry now.  I had imprisoned the after-image of her soul that had remained in me within the cross.  And then I had left it to leech back out of the cross into a distant world where it could claim no part of me again.  I would not go near it, or some weakness in me would pull it back into myself.<P>At that thought, the tears bleed from my eyes again, and the snarl twists my features again.  A rage fires inside of me that beats at the walls of my head, screaming to get out.  But I will not release it.  The city around me has already paid the price for that rage, and nothing else near me is left to pay it again.  So I wall it away in my head, and let it force the tears from my eyes, and they boil away as they roll down my cheeks, just as the tears of others once boiled on the Twisted Cross.<P>The worms crawl behind my forehead.<BR>The knife jerks inside my heart.<P><BR>Hedron<BR><a href="http://www.kaaos.com/hedron/falseprophet.htm" target="_blank">The False Prophet</a><BR><a href="http://www.kaaos.com" target="_blank">KAAOS</a><P>...No child, don't cry.  Your tears only boil away on the Twisted Cross.  It's your blood that soaks in deep.  Your blood...<P><a href="http://www.kaaos.com/hedron/6circles.htm" target="_blank">The 6 Circles</a><BR>
