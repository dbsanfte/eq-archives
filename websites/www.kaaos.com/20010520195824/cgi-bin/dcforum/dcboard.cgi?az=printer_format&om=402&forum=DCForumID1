<blockquote>Ah, what a pleasure it is to have the both of you here gracing our temple with your bleeding cunts. I can’t say as there are two other people I would rather listen to prattle into the night......<P>But what do I find upon delving into your rhythmic bleating? -sigh-<P>Alas, the distress is enough to break my forsaken heart.......<P>For the sake of harmony and goodness (since we all know I care so much about that ;p), I am here to help you fair ladies settle your differences. Yes, I know, I am such the treasure.....you can thank me later. <P>But for now this is what the two of you must do......<P>SHUT THE FUCK UP! <P>You stupid fucking bitches, you are making my eyes bleed.....and normally I enjoy such torment. But with you two, the only thing I want to do is kill myself to be free from the idiocy that is you. <P>My kingdom for mortality!

I was just about to reveal that I went to Medival Times with my gf and had a great time.  Where is my super-special update on Lum's say that I'm the evil PK0r and therefore it's just plain wrong for me to go out and have fun participating in a real life fantasy type dressup event?<P>Its just not fair.  Boo Hoo.

Its your own fault my shit splattered all over your face instead of going straight into your mouth where you like it.   If you'd just learn to shut up and stop flapping your useless jaw it would make the whole situation much easier.

Perhaps personal blame could be laid upon the reception rather than the virulence of said misery. Perhaps, had one a choice. Unfortunately, being an eternal fixture in this temple provides for no such luxuries.	<P>But truth be told, you have served as a valiant disciple over the years. Don’t think for a moment that the conviction with which you’ve served your lord, by spreading your wave of nausea from realm to realm, has gone unnoticed.<P>One day, when the ultimate goal is realized....when humanity has lost all hope and has sunken into the depths of my poison....rest assured you will sit by my side, affixed squarely upon a throne of my shit.....Immortalized.<P>Until such time you have much to learn my child. For example, when to morph the strain so that it stays virulent. You see the human body is rather durable and capable of rendering many viruses impotent when a consistent strain is left too long in the system. <P>Azmodion<BR>Lord of Misery<BR>KAAOS God of Misfortune

Monsignor Azmodion..STFU! Things were heading in the right direction and then you chose to 'grace' us with your rhetoric drivel that can only remind one of a Dennis Miller diatribe. They don't need to STFU, they need to keep it going and introduce a proper mixture of mud wrestling and hair pulling w/ mpeg video.

Arguing with China is like arguing with a broken record that continually repeats itself.  I give up.  She wins.  She's a roleplayer extraordinaire and the Mercs are really cool people who are actually very good at warcraft, tactics and strategy despite their tendencies to only attack noncoms.  Whoda thunk it?<BR>

You can’t see it Sang but I am flipping you off right now....<P>Don’t you think I knew where it was heading? Why do you think I put an end to it? Damn wenches are gonna cut into my business....There will be female mud wrestling but it will be my toothless whores in zippered hoods doing the wrestling, after you pay me for the pleasure first of course. <P>So in closing, piss off Sang. If I see your horse lips flapping in my general direction again I WILL point Azeraab’s ass at your face......<P>Try me pissant.
