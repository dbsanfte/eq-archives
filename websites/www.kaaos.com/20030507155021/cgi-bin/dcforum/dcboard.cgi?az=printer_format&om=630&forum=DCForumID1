<blockquote>After Elric started some lies about me being a bad player of Ultima I then had a comment by Malice of course. This guy has tried many times to make me mad for some strange reason. It wont work becouse I was met with much greater hostilities when I made my first post with my application. Was it my fault that the person who started the forum was too dumb to set up a running application form. <P>Here I have proof that Malice is more of a troll. He wants to start shit but of course never finishes backing it up.<P>Malice - "you have no friends in this clan. hell the only bearing you have is a fucking beggar status. this is a poor sad attempt to make a friend.<P>Very thought out here so I better make another responce since the first one went unchallenged. I was in fact invited by Mike Reveal who is apart of the high ranks. Why do you make assumptions about stuff you have no clue about? You can even ask him if he was in fact my friend. He has been on my icq messanger for four years. <P>Malice will not change his ethics but at least I know he is in fact a liar.</blockquote><hr><b><font size=2>Table of contents</font></b><hr>

geo's real life based on his posts is sad. ranking his own posts, taking time to think of shit he thinks is clever. cowering inside his house he has nothing better to do but relish in being a loser and reading every post, and msg. hoping he would somehow spring up someone to share his input. this is a pathetic atempt to make a friend. <P>

Very well thought out stuff we got here. Even though this post was made just to explain what an application is for. A KAAOS application is just made to turn down 100% of the people who desire to have a clan. I have no proof but I am sure even if the application files were working now that there were none approved by the "gods" of gaming, ROFL!<P>MaliSe has made the assumption that I read every post. How does he have proof of this? I no longer rank my own posts. This used to be fun to do so that I can turn a one rank back to a nine. This is a fact becouse the ranking system sucks here. I can vote my rank 1000 times if I wanted to and I think that is funny. I am real sorry if no one else sees the humor in it. Maybe cause your all too busy being mad and not being able to have humor. <P>The application was broke when I tried to apply and the ranking system sucks. I wonder what else sucks badly with your sporty clan with no rules?<P><BR>

Research on the origin of the name? Did Geo send you here? It's a condition not a name and it is misspelled much like many people do to the words in the english language when playing games. You may read about it here <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=malaise&r=2" target="_blank">http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=malaise&r=2</a><BR>Now begone!<P>SangDraxx<BR>KAAOS<BR>The Serpent Lord<P><BR>

Is that you don't see how clicking 1000 times to change a numeric rank on your own post makes you a complete fucking loser :)  You represent the dregs my friend, live proud.<P>Seo

I could click it 1000 times but I never went past clicking 20 to 35. I get bored of it since I do have a life. I don't do it anymore. <P>Being a hacker takes more time than that.
