         I agree with all that.<P>Simply put tho Az, I have not had the opportunity (until now) to experience play with my guild. For me its an old school PvPer in a new setting. I have the same basic mindset of any other person who's participated in a lot of PvP. Im not a whiner, you wont hear me complain about getting bitch slapped by a player 10 lvls over me, or ganked by a group of 6. PvP isn't about fair, I know that. If you are going to play with the big boys you have to take it all seriously, I know that as well. <P>However, I dont like EQ... ive already stated that. So why play? Because the better I know my team the better I am able to work with them and understand them. Even to a point fight with them better so I wont have to take the time to learn this in Shadowbane, a game I believe I DO want to play. <P>As for the time ratios you set for lvling I believe you are probably right. However, for all practical purposes I am an EQ newb. So naturally it takes me longer to figure out where to go and what to do to excel. You see, my situation is different from yours in that KAAOS as a whole has long term experience with all its members. Did you guys start out on top? Hell no. Did you all start out working perfectly together like a team of synchronized swimmers? Not likely. Im learning to play with my team, and yes if I ACTUALLY wanted to make my mark and not be seen as a total PvP/MMORPG newbie I would do everything in my power to be on top. <P>I played Napa Valley of UO for three years. I DID want to be known there and so I took every measure to do so. And I did quite well, I can tell you with little reservation that I was one of the best on the server. Of course that doesnt really matter now. <P>Anyway, back to square one. You're right, to be the best you must strive to do it in every environment you come to. But, you dont start out as the best. So I have to start somewhere, a fresh start with a new guild. And no matter how hard I try I dont have the desire to be the best in a game I dont like playing all that much. Its not a BAD game, its just "ok". You guys all know as well as I do that in most cases (until maybe very high lvls after much time invested) EQ takes very little "player skill" to excel in. As you have all said before its all about lvls and equipment. And you and I both know that that is kinda cutting the heart and soul out of PvP. I know your going to tell me that you have to do whatever it takes to win, but sometimes its just not very fun =). <P>Anyway, im lvl 26 now and steadily rising... Its not that im unwilling to sink the time in, im just unwilling to put in for the long haul. EQ just doesnt mesh well with me. Well, enough of my rambling, get back to your lvling *grin*<P>-Rek
