<blockquote>AO is pretty smooth, but still buggy. Already it puts the "big 3" to shame in all ways.  Makeing them all look like 2 kids in a basement jobs in comparison.  It has a 3 sided political "racewar" areas as well as free pvp zones.  Probably be the frist of the new games to be released.<P>SB is kinda the front runner among the PvP crowd, mostly based on early statements of support for PvP which have since been nerfed. Political PvP with high or no limit to the number of "teams."  Appears to still be in alpha, realistic realease about a year off.<P>DaoC being called "EQ done right."   Somehow that doesnt inspire overly much confidence.  Three sided political PvP.  Into the beta, probably be realeased this year still.<P>Others...?  Horizons?<P>Which do you guys think will be the shit?<BR></blockquote><hr><b><font size=2>Table of contents</font></b><hr>

I agree to a certain extent, what they were saying early on was promising.  Unfortunately as time goes by they seem to be drifting further and further away from the original concept and ideas that got many of us hooked.  My biggest concern for SB, and it is a huge concern of mine, is that the entire PvP system will hang on a Paper/Scissors/Rock type character 'balance'.  Similar to what AC used to have Mage&gt;Melee&gt;Archer&gt;Mage and so on).<P>This would almost totally negate the human skill aspect that I crave.  If I am the most intelligent, skilled, strategic PvP mind on the game I should be able to kill anyone, anytime, consistently.  If I am the most intelligent, skilled, strategic PvP mind on the game and I would still die almost every time to any newb with an archer because that is how the game is balanced I would be severely pissed and probably not stay on SB for long.   I might just go into a coma until FW finally gets finished.<P>~Shea<BR>No guild.<BR>No witty catchphrase.

WP's description was something like this.  You initiate combat, you automatically keep doing normal attacks.   You get special attacks based on your class/discipline.   These work something like kick/bash/backstab/harmtouch/layonhands in EQ.   This is almost exactly what AO is doing as well.<P>If some of the special powers are unique and interesting combat might be fun.  For example AO has a power called Dismatch, its the only one that uses "mana" it requires less mana than most "spells" and regardless of how much mana you have it puts you at -10.  Basically its a desperate last ditch attack.  Having a few dozen interesting powers like this could make things pretty cool.<P>Still with all games coming out it looks like you have combat of attrition (BAD) not a combat like NWN/DSO where you jockey for position, then the actual kill takes only a few seconds (GOOD).<P><BR>

Overall DAoC is a good game with a lot of potential.  <P>The main problem with it, is the leveling treadmill system (thus the EQ comparisons).  A lot of us in beta have been trying to fight against this system, but it doesn't look like it will be changing anytime soon.  However, they are implementing a clever quest system that should take care of over 80% of the experience to max.<P>There is the 3 realm warfare, but that isn't the only type of PvP that will be going on.  Each realm is going to have some arenas (where in-realm PvP will be taking place).  They are also fixing an option for an in-realm dueling system as well (in-realm PvP anywhere).  So there will be plenty of in-realm fighting, there just has to be an element of consent (head to the arenas, or ask someone to duel).<P>As for good old fashioned human skill.....Well that died with NWN.  DAoC is going with the rock/paper/scissors system, which as most know will add up to one #####class per realm you play in, which is a huge downer, and of course Mythic doesn't understand this.<P>A lot of people are interested in an FFA server for the frontier, which would be interesting, but we are still waiting for Mythic to respond to that on the beta boards.<P>From what I hear it is six months ahead of SB, so you may want to check it out.  <P>IMO DAoC blows AO out of the fuckin pool, but maybe that is just me.<P>SB looks very promising, hopefully they get their asses in gear.<P>~Dom

I'm somewhat surprised that mythic's class system sucks that bad.   In Magestorm they had a class system that actually worked.  <P>Each class was stronger based on where they were on the map, but even where they were they strongest they could still be beat by any other class.  All classes had a direct nuke type spell, the main differences came in what else they had.   One class could heal, one could fly, one could drop "mines", etc.<P>That actually made for a cool system.

Heh, good point Spud.  I think it also has something to do with people in the new age market screaming for such vast diversity.  <P>So of course the developers have that as one of the foremost things positioned in their mind, which ends up leading to problems come crunch time.  They make the character race/classes so incredibly diverse under the r/p/s system that they lose their bearings in the end.<P>Not to say that it isn't possible, as nearly all MMORPGs up to this point have had PvP in the back of their head (which seemed to work remarkably well for NWN, and remarkably horrible for UO, AC, and EQ), but I believe that the system will be very unlikely to work in SB and DAoC (as they have it imagined).<P>~Dom

Players scream for diversity.  I agree.  I dont mind being surrounded by people in platemail when I'm on the battlefield, but hanging out in town if everyone has full plate on it's kinda silly.<P>But devs are stupid.   Instead doing something like making heavy armor slow you down, so that its the best choice for mass battles, but for normal adventuring when speed of travel and the ability to outrun something is more important than a little extra protection light or medium armor is actually better, they make it so you cant wear platemail if you cast spells.  Creating a handful of different looks that everyone of a particular class is stuck with instead of a broad range based on situation.<P>I wish for the game where I can change from being a "ranger" to "warrior" by selling my bow and studded leather and buying platemail and a 2 handed sword.  Instead I have to spend 6 months camping static spawns.   Fuck that.

That’s what I’ve been saying since NWN, what is wrong with MMORPG’s that is.....Everyone wants to be a super hero. There’s not enough room in a massively multiplayer game for EVERYONE to be the super hero. Of course people don’t buy games and play games to be the same peons they are in real life. They are buying into the “fantasy” on the box. Just like in real life, instead of realizing they are dumb fucks and working to change that they would rather just whine about it. “Whaaaaa whaaaaa whaaaaa, no fair, I want to be the super hero now”.<P>Developers are in business and that business is to make money, bottom line. They don’t give a rat’s ass about what “you” think is a good game. All they care about is what will entice the most people possible into giving them money. That’s life, that’s the way it is, and you can’t fault them for it. <P>There will never be a good PvP game made. NWN was damn good but it was an accident. Now that people are “trying” to incorporate PvP there won’t be anther accident. The percentage of skilled, intelligent, people is very low. It’s human nature for the clue-less, the skill-less, the ambition-less, the brain-less fucks in this world to run away in the face of adversity. This is the same reason why guilds like KAAOS cause other guilds like Darkenbane to fold under pressure. <P>Basically, the hopelessly clueless kanks that make up the majority of the cash cow want to be super heros too and if it isn’t handed to them they are gonna go somewhere else rather than work to be a super hero. For the game companies this equation adds up to this.....No gimp, no cash.

Darkenbane is not indictive of most people.   They are losers who managed to set themselves up to win more often than not.   They have become accustomed to an undeserved w/l ratio.  <P>I had a roommate that loved Star Wars.   So he bought Jedi Knight and convinced me to play it.   I'm not big on FPS but I payed.  He sucked.  The matches went to 10 frags.  He usually had 2. I felt so bad I would let him get a few undeserved kills sometimes.  We played for a few hours.   Finally when we stopped it was becuase I was sick of the game.  He, on the other hand had gotten up to 4 or 5 frags per game.    He was all excited, because compared to himself he was doing really well.  But in absolute terms 10 to 5 is still getting owned.<P>When I was playing UO on baja with a different roommate we were PKing in the same room on computers right next to each other with cable modems.  With .17 ms pings, a great character and an almost too well coordianted team it wasnt even a challenge.  As stat-loss murderers my only death in 500 kills was when my computer crashed.  My roomie died once when he charged 6 antis with no mana.<P>We quit after only a few weeks because it was too easy.  It just wasnt fun winning all the time.   <P>I'm accustomed to about 1 death in 20 fights.   Transition to EQ where combat is much less about skill caused it to go to about 1 in 10.  No problem.   Go to a game where like blackjack where it's mostly chance and I win 50/50.  It's just not fun at all.   Yet there are thousands of people who love blackjack.   Even solitaire I think has only a 20% chance to win any given hand.  There are 4 people in my office playing it right now.   Just like the game against AI where you win 99%   it's fucking BORING.<P>I guess the long-gotten to point is that it's not so much about winning.  It's about having wins be in line with what you expect.<P>There are many EQ gimps on bluebie servers who never get past 20th level because they keep dying to mobs.   They keep playing.  They arent necessarily even the ones who bitch.<P>The bitching comes from a need to not be at fault, an unwillingness to just accept that bad things happen and a desire to just blow off steam.   <P>The perfect example is when playing SG someone playing artillery will be under attack from aircraft.  They say "AA(anti air) plz help" "AA protect the artillery!"  "You assholes, help"  "You fuckers dont protect the artillery" I look around and see no allied players with AA.<P>It's the same "bitch about how it's someone's fault even when it isnt" mindset that has caused so much damage to otherwise good games.<P>In UO hiding while in combat was fairly powerful, but it should be, it required a whole skill to be good at it.   Lots of people would get caught unprepared and since it was unrealistic (but balanced) it got nerfed.<P>There will be a bunch of people who call for nerfs and cry when they have trouble with something.  "I lost to a wizard, they are too powerful, nerf them."<P>I dont see a direct relationship between this kind a complaining and quitting.   My gf complains about everything.   She's too cold, her feet hurt, she's tied.   I tell her to put on a jacket, sit down or take a nap.   She doesnt want to hear solutions.  She just wants to bitch.<P>The real problem is that the developers cant tell the difference between someone bitching about PKs just because they got killed and are a little riled up about it, and the few who just cant stand being PK'd anymore.  They make the false assumption that it's all the later.<P>They assume that bluebie servers are so much more popular for this very reason.   They are wrong.  The simple solution is that most people will take the path of least resistance.  PvP  is an added resistance.   Given the choice of climbing stairs or taking an elevator 90% will take the elevator.   Would they use the stairs without complaint if there were no elevator?  You bet.<P>Everyone here knows that once maxxed PvP is vital to continued interest.    You can only kill a dragon so many times before it's a bore.  The quick level curves of NWN/DSO made that obvious.  The slow ass one of EQ makes it seem untrue.<P>Devs are stupid.

Most gamers will always have no skill and no inclination to learn, so therefore, there needs to be at least as much attention given to the winning aspects of PvP as the losing aspects.

Artificial means of making a PvP win hurt the winner are... stupid.  Very stupid.  Analogy: Hey, social security didn't work for shit guys.. lets throw 300 billion more into it.  <P>In meridian the winners of PvP were hurt, because it was a small knit community, and people got pissed off when someone else was the king of the mountain.  Once almost our entire server ganged up on my guild because we were seen as the 'strongest' guild on the server.  That's how winning should hurt.  Not faction loss bullshit, or guards magically appearing to destroy you in a single blow.  Not that you can't teleport for the next hour, or that anyone else can therein kill you without a penalty for an hour.  All bullshit.  No other game since Meridian had a good guild system.  Meridian had guild halls that carried prestige, guild tournaments (My guild won a tournament shortly before half the server ganged us), and the like.  <P>Jealousy, hatred, pride.  These are what make losing hurt less and winning 'hurt more'.<P>Shadowbane with it's guild towns and system where guilds can build and maintain world-wide recognition and prestige will create it's own non artificial methods for those losers to deal with those 'winning bastards' (hah! :p).  It's not a dev issue.  So far I don't see Shadowbane developing any (too) artificial means of making the losers feel better.  That's good, they (losers) can make themselves feel better that way.<P>Another thing.  3do, the makers of meridian, had fucking shit for customer support and in game "guides" to bitch at.  Players dealt with shit themselves, they didn't (COULDN'T) run to the skirts of the company hosting the world.  You were put on hold for an hour if you even dared called 3do, then usually told that they didn't deal with in game problems other than hacking and bugs.<BR>
