          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><b>TEAM KAAOS</b><br>
            Slayve - Sir Rellik - Hedron - Azimer<br>
            1996 Champions of the Neverwinter Guilds PVP Tourney</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> The young boy 
            sat next to the old man on the steps of the armor shop in Neverwinter. 
            "Tell us the story again, sir" said the excited young boy, and the 
            gathered crowd of about 15 children echoed his request. "Pleeeeease!" 
            they all shouted. The toothless, sightless old beggar merely laughed, 
            wet his dry lips from his wineskin and sat the lad on his knee and 
            began his tale to the throng of children once more... </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">"These are the 
            tales of legends, boys", said the old man. "The kind you hear passed 
            down from generation to generation. But we live in exciting times, 
            boys, exciting indeed", the old man took another long sip from his 
            wineskin. The wide-eyed children barely breathed, so that they missed 
            none of the story. "This is the tale of the greatest PVP battle the 
            lands have ever known!" he shouted for dramatic effect and the children 
            cheered wildly, but quickly quieted down when he raised his hands. 
            "These events are happening around us right now, and just barely a 
            new moon ago, BDA and KAAOS fought to prove who were truly the best 
            warriors in the realms. MECH teams, UDL teams, ITB teams, Mask teams, 
            OGS teams, and KEF'ers all fell before the might of KAAOS and BDA. 
            None stood in their way, and when the smoke cleared on all the battlefields, 
            there were two decisive victors, and no doubt the two most powerful 
            Guilds had made it to the final battle". The old man heard the children 
            whispering excitedly, and he smiled as he knew he had their complete 
            attention, as he began his legendary tale... </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">"It was a cool, 
            cloudless day in the Neverwinter Woods. High noon. After the punishment 
            of the Night Mask team by KAAOS, and the destruction of the once powerful 
            ITB's at the hands of the deadly BDA, the two most powerful PVP forces 
            in Neverwinter would clash this day. The Dreadlord of KAAOS, Sir Rellik, 
            entered the North East woods on his jet black stallion, letting his 
            blonde, flowing mane fall around his shoulders as he dismounted. The 
            Demon God, Slayve, seemed to appear out of the thin air from amongst 
            the shadows of the trees, his obsidian flail at the ready. Azimer 
            rode in on his Arabian steed, dismounted, and with a wave of his hand 
            the creature shimmered and disappeared into thin air. The False Prophet 
            of KAAOS arrived last, fashionably tardy. Cloaked in dour gray and 
            holding his Twisted Cross, Hedron waited impatiently for the bloodshed 
            to begin." Another pull from his wineskin and the old man continued... 
            </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">"The Drow team 
            of Kh0lari, Sylverion, Modalex, and Sagx seemed to ooze gracefully 
            from the shadows and were ready to attack in the blink of an eye. 
            The fight would be amongst giant scorpions and deadly remhoraz'es. 
            Slayve entered first and quickly ran to the left and Globed. In came 
            Sagx, Sir Rellik, Modalex with no incidents, and each globed in turn. 
            Sylverion appeared in the midst of the Remo's and fate played it's 
            fickle hand. Sylverion's appearance seemed to startle the giant worm-like 
            beasts and one attacked Sylverion and it's deadly maw was wrapped 
            around Sylverion's torso before he could even react. In one long gulp, 
            Sylverion was gone. The Gods of KAAOS laughed! Yet they knew the battle 
            was far from over. Fumbles, Stink Clouds, and holds flew as the BDA'ers 
            tried to overcome their one man deficit. Slayve and Azimer cornered 
            Modalex from the others and quickly set about pummeling him. He was 
            nearly dead as he Dimension Door'd away to catch his breath. Slayve 
            quickly followed with a DD of his own, as he would not be denied his 
            kill. Meanwhile, Kholari came under the effects of Rellik's Hold spell 
            and things looked grim until Sagx freed his Held companion. Hedron 
            cast Lightning at Sagx and Kh0lari, but both Globes were still intact. 
            Sagx and Kholari quickly surrounded Hedron and started battering him 
            with their deadly drow magic. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Hedron staggered 
            free and headed for the gravely wounded Modalex. He would get one 
            kill in before his own demise, he vowed. As Kholari ran back to Hedron, 
            Azimer and Slayve once again surrounded Modalex and repeated their 
            deadly assault on the wounded Drow. Hedron, sensing his death was 
            near, unleashed a final devastating blow to Kholari just as the drow 
            sent him to the gate. No sooner had Hedron fallen, than Azimer delivered 
            the killing blow to Modalex. Kholari now sorely wounded tried to Hold 
            Slayve, Azimer and Rellikk but failed. After an ill placed attack 
            by Slayve, Sir Rellik's nine inch serrated dagger ended Kholari's 
            time in the battle and the Gods smiled, now knowing it was but a matter 
            of time. Sagx sent a Lightning Bolt through Slayve and Rellik, but 
            they retaliated with magic of their own and Sagx ran for cover under 
            their deadly assault.</font> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The 
            chase was on! Sagx's guerilla takes proved effective for a few rounds, 
            but once surrounded, he was quickly overwhelmed. Azimer, Rellik and 
            Slayve battered him down and in a final scream of "KAAOS!!!", Sagx's 
            bloody body was sent gateward and the Gods of KAAOS stood victorious!" 
            </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The children 
            remained silent for a second more, then let out a boisterous, wild 
            cheer. They jumped up and down and started a "mock PVP" amongst themselves. 
            They laughed and shouted as the images of the legendary battle were 
            still fresh in their minds. The young boy on the old man's lap merely 
            looked at him, "What happened then?" he asked innocently. The old 
            man took the boy from his knee and raised his weary bones to stand. 
            "That is a question which only the future may know the answer to. 
            There shall be other struggles and there shall be other warriors to 
            test the mettle of KAAOS in the future, and other tales shall be told 
            about those battles too. Be patient young one, the best is yet to 
            come." said the old man as he picked up his wineskin. The boy pondered 
            a moment, and jumped up excitedly, "Thanks mister!" he yelled and 
            bolted to where his friends were still playing. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">From beneath 
            his hooded cloak, the old man's mouth formed into a sinister grin 
            as he stood upright, dropped the wineskin to the ground and sight 
            returned to his eyes. He pulled the hood back and anyone who would 
            have been watching from the shadows would have seen Doc Krypto there, 
            laughing, and reveling in the glory of KAAOS.</font></p>
