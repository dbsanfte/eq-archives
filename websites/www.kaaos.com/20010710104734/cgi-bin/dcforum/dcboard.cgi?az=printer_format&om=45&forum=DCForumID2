<blockquote>Laposn walks into the largest tavern run by KAAOS and looks around.  Everyone looks different but in away they are all the same.  Every KAAOS member has his right hand in a hardened fist, with their wrists hanging forward losely.  Every second or so they would hit their chests lightly with their fist, as they jerk their head lightly to the side.<P>A short man wearing a toga walks up to Laposn and begins to speak in a loud squeaky voice.  "OH hello there!!!  It is just swell to see you!!!  Swell.  My name is Hedron"  Hedron's obvious lisp was very annoying.  "Oh no, I alomost forgot!!!  You are a pissbucket.  There now that I said that, the toga party is out back, and the crack party with the male prostitutes is in the third door down the right of the hall."<P>Laposn kicks Hedron in the crotch and he replies, "HAHA, nice try, but Myschyf cut those off long ago."  Then Hedron waddled away revealing a giant stick shoved up his ass.<P>Laposn cut the head off of the person nearest the exit and walked away.</blockquote><hr><b><font size=2>Table of contents</font></b><hr>

<font size="1" color="#FF0000">LAST EDITED ON May-10-01 AT 06:40&nbsp;PM (PST)</font><p>*OOC Version of Fizzle's Rant*<P><BR>I know I'm not supposed to respond to this shit, but if ya gotta problem with it fuck you and die. Besides, Laposn obviously doesn't know that this is an RP forum or he wouldn't post that shit up here. There's a difference between someone with bad RP writing skills and this bullshit. You (hopefully) didn't even make any fucking effort. <P>Of course RP stories aren't what make or break a KAAOS wannabe, but Jesus fucking Christ! What the fuck is this? Do you think by being such a fucking dumbass that KAAOS will either feel sorry for you or keep you around longer? It was kinda funny to see someone as lame as you trying to get into KAAOS for a few days, but now your act is just getting fucking old.<P>-Fizzle<BR>Your God<BR>_______________________________________________________________________<P>*RP Version of Fizzle's Rant*<P><BR>Fizzle walks into the KAAOS tavern and notices that the KAAOS Gods are looking and laughing at something in the corner. He looks over to see what they are laughing at and sees a scrawney figure wearing a jesters suit. The figure was imitating a retarded person, making stupid sounds, acting goofy, and spouting childish insults, obviously trying to entertain the Gods.<P>The KAAOS Gods stayed up late drinkin' beer, tokin' up, and watching the jester do his act. Even in thier drunken and stoned stupor, we begin to notice that his act is getting old and repetitive. As some of them start to come down they realize that the jester isn't imitating anything at all, he is just being himself. This adds a little amusement for a little while, but he was starting to get annoying as he kept repeating himself and doing the same old thing. <P>The Gods started to insult and ridicule him more than usual and were telling him to leave. Eventually he said he was leaving, but he didn't even start to leave. He kept on trying to entertain them hoping to stay at the tavern just a little longer, but the Gods just got increasingly annoyed. They began to throw things and shout at him to get out, but the jester danced his goofy dance and spouted more and more nonsense to try to please the Gods. <P>The retarded little piece of shit started to realize that he wasn't wanted at the tavern. He bagan to get very angry, so he started heading towards the door. As he was leaving, he was yelling how great he was for "spying" on a guild, although he was just allowed in the tavern that was open to the public. <P>After he left, I noticed him heading towards a McDonalds. He later claimed to be a great spy because they let him use the public bathrooms to ram a plunger handle up his ass thinking of Sean Connery as James Bond, wishing he was 007.<P><BR>-Fizzle <BR>Your God<BR>Get out of My Fucking Tavern

Standing at the entrancce to the tavern, I witness Laposn's childish disply and chuckle. I had heard that the gods were being rougher on would be recruits than usual. Based on Lap's reactions, that much had been confirmed.  He didnt even notice me as he walked out, he was so disoriented.<P>Reaching into the brewmasters' bag of tricks, I pull out 2 of Thorn's Triple I Supreme minikegs (one of which has what appears to be a Neverwinter issue MECH power supply) and catch up with the poor sod. "it appears to me that you've had a rough day", I muse as I hand him the now-tapped minikeg (akin to putting a straw in a can of soda.. a typical keg-tap wouldn't have been practical), "this should take a bit of the edge off what troubles you, some of the finest ale in any realm.".<P>As Laposn turns away, I press a button on the power supply on the second minikeg, starting its overload sequence. with the care more common in a master thief , I slide the now enabled minikeg MECH grenade into the hood of his cloak and head back to the tavern, where Hedron and a clutch of the recruits who hadn't broken were about to give chase..<P>"no need to worry about the reject Hedron, he's been taken care of... watch."  Lap hadn't gotten too far, still in sight of the tavern entrance as the MECH grenade reached critical mass and exploded, rending Laposn into an assortment of charred pieces. Several of the larger pieces splattered off the wall of the tavern, while Lap's head landed at the feet of the False Prophet. "while im sure you would've relished the opportunity to torture him, it was far more than he deserved. I'm sure there's a place in the reject hall of shame to put this fool's head."<P>Titokhan<P><P>
