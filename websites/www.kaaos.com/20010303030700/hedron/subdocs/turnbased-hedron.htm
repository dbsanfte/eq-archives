<font color = "red" face = "Arial" size = -1><b>Body of Message:</b></font><p><font color = "white" face = "Arial" size = -1>: I don't know what your point was. It started out as a turn-based vs. Real-time combat then ended in what makes for good PvP. Everything you stated that makes for good PvP is true and for the best strategic PvP you need a turn-based system. That's not to say what is more fun or what certain people enjoy. Some people like action packed quick reflex PvP and there's always strategy involved in that as well.<p><blockquote><b>The post set out to explain that real-time vs. turn-based are not opposite stances.  The point I was making was that the elements involved in strategic game play have nothing to do with whether you're RT or TB.  They are independent of that question.<p>By spelling out the  strategic elements of game play, I was hoping to make dumb-fucks like you understand, while staring at the list, that those elements can exist equally well in both RT and TB.  Get it? ;)<p>We have raised some good points though in that the real differences between RT and TB are these:<p>1) Time to think<p>2) Logistical problems with the duration of fights in large multi-player environments<p>3) Time to communicate via the clunky systems now available (all text, no voice)<p>4) This is a new one - simultaneous movement. Events occuring simultaneously lend a while new dimension to strategy which doesn't exist in TB.  If, in nwn, I had chosen to dim door to a new spot at the same time you did, then the NPC manipulation would have become alot harder.<br></b><br></blockquote><p>Hedron<br>The False Prophet<br>KAAOS<p><p>
