         <blockquote>
         &gt;I see a long line of <BR>&gt;why you won't fight us. <BR>&gt; Cowards? Fucking cowards. <P><BR>Not being an EQer(all the happy pastel colors disgust me), I don't know the rules of this new server. However, it seems to me that if you actually want KAAOS to fight you, then you should attack KAAOS rather than staying away from KAAOS and calling them pussies for not attacking you.<P>If you want someone's attention you don't whine endlessly on their boards, you go up to them and smack them around. Will KAAOS continue to ignore your pathetic existence if you actually kill some of their members? I think not.<P>Just ask Darkenbane, they attacked KAAOS. They were attacked back heavily. Even with all the lies that Darkenbane spews, they never claimed that KAAOS was unwilling to fight.<P>If game mechanics don't allow you to attack them, then train them instead. You can do that to everyone.<P>&gt;You played a blue EQ server, <BR>&gt;yes?<P>KAAOS has played on 3 different PvP servers: the original one, the coin loot only teams server, and finally Sullon Zek.<P><BR>&gt;<BR>&gt;I recall that type on Tallon. <BR>&gt; "Wait, I'm leveling, I'll <BR>&gt;fight later!!"  Guess what? <BR>&gt; They never fought.  <BR>&gt;They leveled to 50, got <BR>&gt;their #####items, and now sit <BR>&gt;around in large guilds claiming <BR>&gt;dominance, but not a damn <BR>&gt;one of them lifted a <BR>&gt;finger in PvP combat along <BR>&gt;the way. <P>Did you ever attack that person? Or did you just sit around like his little bitch as he claims his dominance over you?<P>&gt;Because he has PvP'd (Even <BR>&gt;at the lower levels), while <BR>&gt;the lad he fought was <BR>&gt;busy leveling to "fight later". <BR>&gt;<P>Sure, experience counts. KAAOS already has that from the other PvP servers. From that experience KAAOS knows that levels and equipment are both important in EQ. They don't want to be fighting losing battles. They're smarter than that.<P>&gt;<BR>&gt;Truth is after 45 it is <BR>&gt;very difficult to die in <BR>&gt;PvP unless you suck.  <BR>&gt;Thats it, isn't it?  <BR>&gt;You will enjoy PvP after <BR>&gt;45 because you won't have <BR>&gt;to die as often and <BR>&gt;then you can't be beaten, <BR>&gt;thus you can maintain your <BR>&gt;reputation as the premeire killing <BR>&gt;guild?  Afterall, you'll be <BR>&gt;hunting lowbies that are enjoying <BR>&gt;the PvP server for all <BR>&gt;it's worth, those with ten <BR>&gt;times more skill than yourselves <BR>&gt;in PvP, but deficient in <BR>&gt;a world where levels and <BR>&gt;items dictate true strength. <BR>&gt;<P>You just admitted that levels and items are more important in EQ, yet you accuse KAAOS of being pussies because they understand the system and what is most important. You call them pussies for taking the intelligent path. That would reinforce the theory (can we call it a Law yet?) that TCE is a group of idiots who don't understand the game that they are playing or are unwilling to do what it takes to win within the bounds of the game(ie no hacking).<P>&gt;Those from Tallon, and Vallon will <BR>&gt;tell you that the best <BR>&gt;PvP, the greatest wars, the <BR>&gt;truest test of skill comes <BR>&gt;around 20-30.  Only at <BR>&gt;this level does any semblance <BR>&gt;of skill dictate success, as <BR>&gt;after this point it is <BR>&gt;purely items that dictate strength, <BR>&gt;and prior to this point <BR>&gt;everyone is too weak to <BR>&gt;make things interesting. <BR>&gt;<P>At 20-30 you have people who are 40-50. So while you're at 20-30, you will be getting completely destroyed by people with pure items and levels. What's so great about that? Instead, KAAOS has opted to be 40-50 where they will have the items to combat all the other 40-50s with the items. That way they get good fair combat. Which is where the true test of skill is.<P><BR>&gt;So, all name calling aside, all <BR>&gt;backpeddling and cowards guised in <BR>&gt;the form of mockery of <BR>&gt;TCE in the past, will <BR>&gt;you flee like a pack <BR>&gt;of injured pups when we <BR>&gt;declare war on you? <P>How about you quit declaring and start attacking? You can hide behind your own declarations all you want, and the rest of the morons will believe that you actually want war. However, until you start attacking you are a never is, a never was, and a never will be.<P>&gt;Admittedly, when you war us your <BR>&gt;entire existance on Sullon will <BR>&gt;become that war.  We'll <BR>&gt;hunt you like deer with <BR>&gt;every last effort, we'll rape <BR>&gt;you at your spawn point, <BR>&gt;we'll make it a habit <BR>&gt;to train you into oblivion. <BR>&gt; That is war.  <BR>&gt;It's not nice, it's war. <P>Expect the same when you actually start to attack.<P><BR>&gt;You will flee us in <BR>&gt;Shadowbane just as you flee <BR>&gt;us now, then race to <BR>&gt;your forums to spout how <BR>&gt;we aren't worth your time <BR>&gt;and declare that you seek <BR>&gt;a better foe.  Truth <BR>&gt;being, you'll never have a <BR>&gt;worthwhile foe unless it bears <BR>&gt;the semblance of a 7 <BR>&gt;year old child carrying a <BR>&gt;lolipop that you can gank <BR>&gt;from behind. <P>Shadowbane is a whole new game: new tactics, new overall gameplay strategies, and of course the ability to seige people. KAAOS chose the better strategy for EQ, you chose the admittedly weaker one. Do you think that will all change when you both hit Shadowbane? Somehow, I don't.<P><BR>Mortarion<BR><i>The god of death and decay</i>
