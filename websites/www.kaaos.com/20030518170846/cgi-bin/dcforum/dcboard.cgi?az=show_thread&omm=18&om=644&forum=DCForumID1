         <blockquote>
         <i>”I was gonna say that would have had to been the case, but figured even the Susans weren't that stupid.”</i><P>It’s funny, every gimp who ever thought they could open their trap about PvP would spew this kind of bullshit. They would say shit like “Well, if they lost because they let their globe drop they were stupid” or “If they stood next to a wall they were stupid”.<P>You said yourself that PvP was an art form in NWN and you were right about that. A simple “rule” like “don’t get caught with your globe down” is not always the reality you will face.<P>I guarantee you, if I fought you in NWN I would have caught you with your globe down. I would have known when your shit (all your shit) was gonna drop before you would. That’s why I won so many fights. You might think you knew when your shit was gonna drop and you may have been right 90% of the time, I was right 100% of the time however. Meanwhile, I always assumed my opponents would know exactly when my globe was going to drop and most of my strategies revolved around not allowing my opponents to get a globe lock. Likewise, I always assumed my opponents would try to not allow me to get a globe lock so I was extremely diligent on acquiring said lock. <P>Additionally, things are different in Quad fights. Most people are not as diligent in their round counting. A lot of turns pass through a round when there are 8 people in the fight. Of course, I knew when everyone’s globe was going to drop, I always knew. I was an anal round counting bastard. I documented every spell (or effect if I couldn’t pinpoint exactly what spell it was) or every action everyone took in each round in each fight I was in. I used that shit to study tendencies of my opponents so I knew what tactics would work best on them when I fought them again, I used that shit to study where I made mistakes if I lost, or simply how I could improve when I won. <P>I could tell you which fighters were text book fighters, which fighters were improvisers, which fighters were aggressive or defensive. I could tell you which fighters were anal globe checkers, which fighters would only perform a token check. I knew which fighters would buy into which fakes, which fighters you could get away with short globing on. Which fighters would fall for a protection 10'. I knew which fighters excelled in NPC manipulation and which fighters had problems in that regard.  <P>We had a situation in that fight where 4 people were having a hell of a time finishing off Krynal. They knew time was running out on those fumbles. They knew Krynal was almost dead. We knew they were probably a little pumped up about the facts of the fight and that most likely not all of them were thinking with 100% clarity. When you fight with emotions you make mistakes. Krynal lured them into range of the walls because he knew their globes were gonna drop and the chances were good that not all of them would realize this the round it dropped. He had a fresh globe and we knew they would need to come to him to Cause if they wanted to finish him. This brought them into the walls.<P><BR><i>”I do remember every time I fought an "old school" NWN'r and even gave him a challenge all I got was bullshit”</i><P>You know why nobody gave you any respect? Because you didn’t shut your fucking trap and listen and learn. I made a post about this phenomenon back in NWN. I said that most NWN PvPers go through several stages of development. <P>Stage 1)  From around 0 - 6 months they suck and they know they suck. But they are learning and they gradually got better. <P>Stage 2)  From around 6 months to around 9 months they start winning some fights, usually more than they lose because they are fighting other gimps in the shack or the sewers. They start thinking they are the shit, they start thinking they know what PvP is all about. It is during this period where they cease to become any better at PvP. This is the period of stagnation for most PvPers. We will call this the 6 month funk. Most people never made it past this stage. These PvPers made up the majority of NWN’s community. They were loud mouth, no skilled fucks. They didn’t give the proper respect to the real PvPers and they sure as fuck didn’t deserve any respect. They never understood advanced NWN tactics and where never even aware of how they really lost a fight.<P>Stage 3)  The next stage of development where PvPers were born. Most people in NWN never left the 6 month funk stage as I mentioned. They simply weren’t good enough, weren’t smart enough, weren’t dedicated enough or their ego wouldn’t allow them to advance past it. But for the true PvPers, those with the wherewithal to advance to the next stage of development, this next stage is when the blinders are lifted and when they truly started to learn. For most, the start of this phase usually happened somewhere between 9 months and a year. It was at this point that the PvPer realized that he knew jack and shit about PvP. That he was an infant, that he had a long way to go and a lot of work ahead of him. PvPers who reach this stage exploded in their skill level. This was the stage of most growth. The ones who made it this far and advanced to the next stage (and most who made it to this stage advanced to the next stage) are the real PvPers. They are still learning but they know they are learning, they know to keep their mouth’s shut, fight with open eyes and open mind and showed respect to the other real PvPers. <P>Stage 4)  The next stage usually happened around the 18 month to 2 year time frame. Skill gain starts to slow dramatically as they have pretty much reached the pinnacle of their learning process. These PvPers are veterans. This is where most of the real PvPers stay. They have confidence, real confidence based on knowledge and skill, not the false confidence of the 6 month funk. They start talking shit again, they start swinging their dick again, only this time they’ve got some skill to back it up. These were the good PvPers. <P>Stage 5) Those who reach stage 5 reach it very shortly after stage 4. They continue to learn, albeit at a much slower rate, and these are the PvPers that are the best of the best. They have separated themselves from the good ones (stage 4). They are the great ones. This was a very small group. They knew all the other good and great PvPers. If they didn’t know you you didn’t deserve to be known.<P>Of course everyone advanced through the stages at different rates. There was a stage 6, unfortunately. Many people who reached stage 5 went on to stage 6. Many people who reached stage 4, but never made stage 5, eventually jumped to stage 6. Stage 6 is when skill starts to decline. Skill decline was mainly due to loss of drive, desire and/or focus.  This loss could be due to many different reasons. Basically, stage 6 was when someone was past their prime. <P>I can tell you were I think you were in the stages but it doesn’t mean anything now. I will tell you though, if we were still in NWN we wouldn’t even be having this discussion. You would either voluntarily be on your god damn knees kissing my feet or I would force you to your fucking knees. That’s the difference with today’s gaming environment, every limp dick thinks they can piss wherever the fuck they want. <P>Azmodion<BR>Lord of Misery<BR>KAAOS God of Misfortune
