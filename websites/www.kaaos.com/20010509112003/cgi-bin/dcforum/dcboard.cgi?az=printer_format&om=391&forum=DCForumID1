<blockquote>::Fuck Wolfpack and fuck Shadowbane::<P>WP has half it's fucking hype only thanks to how much most of the #####clans all hyped it, and two years later with only a few stories and three videos to show, the CORE behind the fucking community starts to get skeptic and a tad pissed rightly so and the fuck us in the ass by deleting the posts we make when posting our concerns so that they may better to appeal to UO2 refugee bakers, Diablo2 coopers and N64 carebears.<P>I say fuck them and there years of progress, fuck them and there grfx models of different color EQ monsters, fuck them and there THREE videos, and fuck there novel worth of fucking game fiction they wasted so much time on for a game they even say is geared more to the hardcore pvper than the EQ RPer. Fuck them and there vapor game that is going to soon be outdone by DAWN/ I say fuck 'em just like GOD fucked them and drop them on their ass. Fuck them and their shit public relations. And fuck their ability to take a picture of a trebuchet from over a year ago and turn the angle on it so it includes the centaur and fuck them with their fucking coders who can't even keep a fucking forum database or a poll listing from crashing. Fuck them and their 50 man LAN pre-gamma-aplha-shitta-beta, and fuck Warden in the ass just like he FUCKED the most dedicated of his community by fucking their opinions, comments and posts. Fuck em right in the ass!<P>Fuck Wolfpack and fuck Shadowbane<P>~Choco FUCKING Sage~</blockquote><hr><b><font size=2>Table of contents</font></b><hr>

Ah, this is why I enjoy the KAAOS boards so much. Every moron with a grudge just seems to come here. What is it with KAAOS that attracts all of these idiots. If he thinks that Shadowbane will suck, then why does he care so much about it.<BR>The same guy is also talking about how good DAWN will be. I just don't understand this much incompetance.<P>Still, he does have better grammar than most of the morons that come here.

I amused myself for about 5 mins last night be comparing the Dawn and SB websites.   The similarities are unnerving.  Dawn's screenshots constist of 4 different angles of the same scene, in SB it is the same wolf model reskinned 4 times.  They promise the world and then some, but all they have is some 3DS MAX models work and possibly a semi funstional 3D engine.   Seems like pretty much the same thing is going on in both cases, execpt in the case of SB everyone doing it is over the age of 8.

Unfortunately, all that hype attracts no skill dumbfucks like you. People like that don't even count as prey. Killing them is like being proud that you killed a bug on your windshield. Unfortunately for you, you can't drive because the DPS doesn't allow legally retarded people (I.Q. under 70) to drive. Maybe for you it's more like being proud because a fly landed into your open, drooling mouth and got stuck.<P>-Fizzle<BR>Your God<BR>Still thinks hype attracts idiots
