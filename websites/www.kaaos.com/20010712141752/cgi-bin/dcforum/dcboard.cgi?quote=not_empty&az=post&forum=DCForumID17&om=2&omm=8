         <blockquote>
         Well don't get too excited about lengthy messages from me.  As a Competitive Analyst (my profession) guy and "migrations coordinator" for a 500+ man guild I look at things in pretty deep space and it takes a lot of words to explain them... 99% of the time I lurke... 1% of the time I write novels about my wild ideas.<P>"Most people don't really give a fuck whether anyone at Wolfpack has any business experience. It doesn't get asked very often."<P>That very well may be the case.  I'd bet you my beta pass that GODgames is banking on that too.  Bikini Clad babe's are probably aimed at the 13 year old crowd and not the MBA's in the audience.<P>However, I personally think it's one of the most important questions someone could ask.  Having run a company right out of college and basing the majority of my fund raising efforts on "he's a wiz-kid" hype may have been effective at the time... but now days (after recovering from the financial results and guilt of possibly squandering squandering a lot of someone else's dollars) I think... "What moron invests in a CEO who has never done this shit before?"  (note: Steve Case was a Soap Salesman, lets remember)<P>First of all, look at how many people say that they are going to make the coolest game ever... and then end up folding.  Illusia, Varago, LoA, etc etc... there is no shortage of big promises which are not backed up by real money.  It happens every time some idiot with a CS degree says "Me and my buddy can do better than THIS... lets make our own game".<P>I like the guys from Wolfpack and enjoyed talking to them.  In fact, I was inspired by their grasp of what a game "could be"... ala the kinda shit Hedron yammers about and everyone else who have hung on to this genre for 10+ years dreams of despite its obvious and repeated demonstrations of cluelessness.<P>But if they negotiate a shitty distribution agreement... if they fuck-up payroll... if they take financial risks... if they don't pay their accountant... if they don't know how to drive a product to market... or if they bend over for some investor or media group to try to get something the "easy way" they are not going to be viable.<P>So what?  Other than the obvious early death sentence, so what?  Well, for example, a financially un-viable company with big ideas... but lawyers on their ass about some small fuck-up when they started out... is going to piss their money away on things OTHER than making the game work real well.  Their founders are going to be squandering their precious brains on trying to solve that distribution fuck-up or fix the oopses they made with the UPC number format or hold off on the contractually required special addition for CompUSA.  They might piss away their resources on free T-shirt give-always rather than get a decent 401k for their employees or blow the money on a "company car" so they can get to work.  They might infringe on someone's copyright crap and not have the legal (financial) capability to hold off the Barbarians at the Gate... and their corner cutting and bootstrapping is going to impact US, the gaming public.<P>Out of money, time, resources, bandwidth, competitive intelligence, or industry contacts?  Lets trim the Tech Support group... lets push the dates out on our delivery milestones... lets nerf worldbuilding and test so that we can ship on time... or hey, how about this one?  lets bend over for Swing!'s investment and distribution channel and they will buy us a server... all we have to do is let 50 of their people play around in our alpha... in fact, we'll tell everyone its a BETA and then tell everyone we hit a milestone! <P>Am I going to recomend that 500 members of my guild cancel their accounts and throw away all those years of asset gathering in EQ or UO so they can start over in Vaporbane?  Not until I see some details... quite simply put, I don't have the mentle BandWidth to read about Mythological UberWeapons.  I'm trying to sort the wheat from the chaff and figure out what the REAL DEAL is on Shadowbane... and the signal to noise ratio is the shits right now. <P>So lets look at what's happening... Wolfpack's running out of ideas for keeping the rabid fan-base interested... They are obviously way off schedule for the Marketing Plan (assuming Todd, the database consultant with Dun & Bradstreet, made one in the first place)... they can't trade on their "info dump" any longer because people demand to know what the hell is the meaning of all the info they dumped... They can't defer attention on the 20 "well known guilds" on their world map because all those guilds say "Hell, we don't know what Shadowbane is going to be like either"... They announced "beta" but it turns out everyone has a Swing! or GODgames employee badge and nobody's talkin... so they get their lone Story Board guy to write up 30 or 40 paragraphs of fiction (see anyone's RP section for thousands of examples of similar content) and drip that out to the info addicts in hopes that it will keep them from freaking out.  THEN they "leak" that they read books (wow) and so should you if you want to play to crush.<P>Sure beats the shit out of Coloring Contests for the kiddies... but some of us have a nose for the more sinister.  I've got 10 to 1 that they are in need of some strong Product Management skills... and I wonder if anyone on staff at Wolfpack has ever had the job of setting the priorities for a real company under even slightly similar conditions.... maybe they have... I don't know... but at least its reasonable to ask who I am putting my faith into... wouldn't you agree?<P>Rant off.  I'll go back to Lurking<P>~f
