Night had fallen.  The crowd was gone.

Only Hedron remained, sitting in the middle of an empty square, still rattling his cup and begging to no one.  He wasn't laughing any more.

65, 66...

Heh.  He had stopped caring.  Did it matter, really?  He knew that the things that you do should be guaged by some measure which tells of success or failure.  But he had come to realize that success and failure are relative concepts.

Today he had collected almost a gold piece for doing nothing of any value to anyone - including himself. A quite good return to trade nothing for something.  He laughed.  In the meantime, with the wave of his hand, he could summon more treasure than could be found on this pathetic little world.  Treasures bought at the price of tremendous expenditures of vicious energy and at the cost of the lives and civilizations which he had snuffed out, like candles.  Which was the better measure of success?

It was interesting to him how his mind slipped around the real matters that weighed on his soul, and turned towards this garbage.  Things used to be about the savage enjoyment that you wrung from life with your own hands.  The costs or the return were not counted - only feeling the burning energy of the DOING mattered.

With a disgusted wave, Hedron forced buring energy through his veins, and healed his "souvenirs".  Standing, he threw the cup of coppers into the night.  They rang like bells as the bounced across the broad flagstones that made up the surface of the marketplace.

An intense non-light halo enveloped his body, and began to grow.  In a sudden jerking twist of reality, a hammer of eldritch power poured out of the sky and into Hedron.  From him, it burst outward in a wave of flames and forces, blowing apart buildings, walls, and people in a terrible roar of destruction.

As it ended, only Hedron stood.  All else was ash and rubble.  A single flagstone survived - the one on which he stood.  And somewhere, in the remains of  distant hovel, two "toughs" lay in cocoons of protection that slowly faded away.  They had been preserved.
