                ARRIVAL</b></font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Sitting upon 
                a large grey stone, an old man looked down at the mass of children, 
                who has gathered around him, who had come to hear one of his tales. 
                A long, knotted grey beard hung down passed the wrinkled skin 
                of his throat, the only hair that could be seen on his head. The 
                old man's eyes could barely be seen behind the thick lenses of 
                his glasses, glasses which lay in the shadows cast by the wide 
                brimmed hat he was wearing. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">With the 
                slowest and most subtle of movements, the old man's frail hands 
                opened the cover of a weathered tome. The children murmured amongst 
                themselves, but one glance from the old man silenced them. As 
                the old man began to tell his story, a story of woe and sorrow, 
                of pain and anguish, the sky above them began to cloud over with 
                dark clouds and the ominous sound of thunder could be heard off 
                in the distance.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> With a storm 
                brewing around them, the old man continued his tale, and the children 
                listened with rapt attention, and more than a couple of them bit 
                their lips as shivers were sent through their bodies from the 
                old man's words. Nodding to himself before continuing, the old 
                man recounted the scariest story he could think of while beads 
                of sweat began to appear on his leathery brow. For, this story 
                brought fear to all, the old, the young, the strong, the weak. 
                </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">All feared 
                the horrid tales of KAAOS. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The old man 
                paused in mid verse, leaving the children to their own thoughts 
                as he remembered the tales he, himself, had heard when he was 
                a child. Many thought that these stories were just used to put 
                a scare in children, but the old man knew better. His fingers 
                unconsciously let go of the tome he had held in his hands and 
                they moved to his cheek, tracing a long purple scar which had 
                been concealed in shadow. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">As his fingers 
                touched the scar, he heard his father's words echoing in his head 
                and in front of him, he no longer saw the massed children, but 
                instead he saw himself sitting before his father as his father 
                recounted this same tale. He listened now as if he had never heard 
                this story before. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The old man 
                listened to his father telling of how the forces which he called 
                KAAOS had once existed in some far off realm. KAAOS, as they called 
                themselves, was a band of the most twisted and warped that any 
                had ever come in contact with, their power being so strong that 
                they were seen as gods and worshipped as them, as well, his father 
                explained to him in the flashback. When they had broken the spirit 
                of those who had lived in that far off realm, KAAOS and a lesser 
                faction began to struggle for control. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The one faction 
                wished to move on, to continue the way of bloodshed and domination 
                against new peoples instead of staying among the spineless. The 
                other faction wished to stay in the same realm where the people 
                lay cowering already. The forces of KAAOS, having made their decision, 
                left the realm of the weak and moved on to new lands where a challenge 
                existed. The leader, one named Malhavok, had brought the most 
                evil and most vile lot with him, leaving the other faction and 
                its weaker members to go their own way. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Thus, KAAOS 
                was born anew, as the movement ended up in the elders cleaning 
                house and weeding out of the weaker members who didnt have the 
                heart. The other faction, chuckled the father as he spoke to his 
                son, became a ragtag band of the slow of wit and weak of soul, 
                who some have heard of as The Mercs. They always strived their 
                hardest to be like their rival guild KAAOS, but they lacked the 
                strength or the wit to survive such a task, and thus they sank 
                into near anonimity. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">His father 
                continued to tell the story, his smile gone from his lips now. 
                While the mercs were always stuck in their own private cesspool 
                of mediocrity, KAAOS flourished. Whereever they went, rivers of 
                blood flowed under their feet. Those who stood before them were 
                crushed and broken, there souls damned to eternal torment at the 
                hands of these Gods of KAAOS. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Then that 
                fateful day came, when the realm that they had conquered was thrown 
                so far into anarchy and chaos, that all of the people were either 
                slain or forced to flee. Thus, that realm ceased to exist and 
                KAAOS was forced to find a new home. A tear began to fall from 
                the corner of the father's eye as he talked to his son. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">"My son," 
                he said, "KAAOS has come here. None of these lands are safe. Even 
                Lord British and his followers are no match for them. We now enter 
                into a dark time.. a time of pain. A time of fear. A time of death." 
                The old man was suddenly awoken from his flashback as a child 
                shook his hand violently. The old man tried to speak, tried to 
                form a reply, but all he could do was gasp for breath and clutch 
                his chest. As he fought against the clawing hand of death, his 
                body began to shake in fear as visions of these dark clad Gods 
                of KAAOS shot through his head.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> Then abruptly, 
                he fell backwards, sprawled on his back ontop of the rock which 
                he had once sat upon. The book fell to the ground with a dull 
                thud and at that instant lightning flashed across the sky and 
                the storm came. Rain and hail began to pummel the earth, causing 
                the children to flee back to their homes, but no child would ever 
                be the same. No child could ever be the same after listening to 
                the story of the old man and after seeing the utter look of terror 
                and anguish that was written upon his face as his life and soul 
                were taken from his body. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Even as the 
                children were running from the storm's destructive power, a new 
                sound could be heard by those who listened. Amidst the thunder 
                and confusion, a low, amused laughter could be heard.. and everyone 
                who heard it knew where it was coming from. As fear swept through 
                the people, the Gods of KAAOS laughed. KAAOS had finally arrived.</font></p>
