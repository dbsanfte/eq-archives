          <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">All 
            throughout the lands of Neverwinter, the cries of those in pain could 
            be heard. Even the tortured souls of children moaned and screeched. 
            But amidst the cries of pain and anguish, the sounds of anger rose 
            much higher.</font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> 
            The people of NeverWinter, despite being harassed by the Nazi rule 
            under the Hitler-like leader, NW Snowie, were fighting back. What 
            did they have to lose? Their homes had already been compromised. Even 
            before the loss of their homes, the secret raids of the uncaring gestapo 
            NW agents took place.. No, NW had not gotten better with time...it 
            had gotten worse.</font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> 
            Luckily these people who were willing to fight until the end, these 
            very people whom were like a family to each other.. they became better 
            and they grew stronger. Whether it be in NeverWinter or elsewhere.. 
            these people would thrive. Well, as long as KAAOS allowed them to, 
            at least. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><b>Amidst 
            the chaos and anarchy, KAAOS was always there.<br>
            KAAOS will always be there.<br>

          <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> 
            Amidst the Gestapo... even in these realms controlled by NW Hitler, 
            KAAOS will always thrive. The lands change, even the faces change.. 
            but the power is always there.</font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> 
            Whether it be hacking SUSANs and WARRs... whether it be House ITB 
            and their festering cesspool of mediocrity... whether it be stupid 
            ass, fucking Nors and other assorted goodies, yelling their gay as 
            hell battle cries.... KAAOS will always be there kicking your asses.

          <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">So, 
            now, I bid you farewell. Many faces will be missed... Many faces will 
            stay the same.. those of you who separated yourselves from the wusses 
            and pussies of the realms, you will be remembered... the rest of you 
            will be forgotten or laughed it. Thus is the way of the Gods. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">However, 
            before the curtain closes... let us take a look around the realms 
            and see what is going on.... Here are a few choice scenes you may 
            wish to look at and remember.. or block out and repress. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Synopsis: 
            We have the scene of NW Lethe and NW Kishpa, two gestapo agents. Both 
            are anal and bleed from their asses, daily. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Imagine, 
            if you will, NW Lethe strapping on her 14 inch strap-on cock and pounding 
            the hell out of NW Kishpa. Imagine Kishpa squeeling like a pig as 
            his stretched asshole was violated by Lethe's massive tool, yelling 
            "Red Vette, save me!" And then having her bitch slap him in response. 
            A cute picture, eh? Perhaps it was Kishpa's pussy it was pounding 
            in and out of, who knows with him? </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I'd 
            like to bid a farewell to those two plus all of the assorted sluts 
            and other fucking anal losers who played this game and lived in our 
            realms. Good riddance. </font></p>
