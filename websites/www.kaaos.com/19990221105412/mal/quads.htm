<P><B><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">The young boy sat next to the old man on the
steps of the armor shop in Neverwinter. &quot;Tell us the story again,
sir&quot; said the excited young boy, and the gathered crowd of about 15
children echoed his request. &quot;Pleeeeease!&quot; they all shouted.
The toothless, sightless old beggar merely laughed, wet his dry lips from
his wineskin and sat the lad on his knee and began his tale to the throng
of children once more...</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">&quot;These are the tales of legends, boys&quot;,
said the old man. &quot;The kind you hear passed down from generation to
generation. But we live in exciting times, boys, exciting indeed&quot;,
the old man took another long sip from his wineskin. The wide-eyed children
barely breathed, so that they missed none of the story. &quot;This is the
tale of the greatest PVP battle the lands have ever known!&quot; he shouted
for dramatic effect and the children cheered wildly, but quickly quieted
down when he raised his hands. &quot;These events are happening around
us right now, and just barely a new moon ago, BDA and KAAOS fought to prove
who were truly the best warriors in the realms. MECH teams, UDL teams,
ITB teams, Mask teams, OGS teams, and KEF'ers all fell before the might
of KAAOS and BDA. None stood in their way, and when the smoke cleared on
all the battlefields, there were two decisive victors, and no doubt the
two most powerful Guilds had made it to the final battle&quot;. The old
man heard the children whispering excitedly, and he smiled as he knew he
had their complete attention, as he began his legendary tale...</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">&quot;It was a cool, cloudless day in the Neverwinter
Woods. High noon. After the punishment of the Night Mask team by KAAOS,
and the destruction of the once powerful ITB's at the hands of the deadly
BDA, the two most powerful PVP forces in Neverwinter would clash this day.
The Dreadlord of KAAOS, Sir Rellik, entered the North East woods on his
jet black stallion, letting his blonde, flowing mane fall around his shoulders
as he dismounted. The Demon God, Slayve, seemed to appear out of the thin
air from amongst the shadows of the trees, his obsidian flail at the ready.
Azimer rode in on his Arabian steed, dismounted, and with a wave of his
hand the creature shimmered and disappeared into thin air. The False Prophet
of KAAOS arrived last, fashionably tardy. Cloaked in dour gray and holding
his Twisted Cross, Hedron waited impatiently for the bloodshed to begin.&quot;
Another pull from his wineskin and the old man continued...</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">&quot;The Drow team of Kh0lari, Sylverion,
Modalex, and Sagx seemed to ooze gracefully from the shadows and were ready
to attack in the blink of an eye. The fight would be amongst giant scorpions
and deadly remhoraz'es. Slayve entered first and quickly ran to the left
and Globed. In came Sagx, Sir Rellik, Modalex with no incidents, and each
globed in turn. Sylverion appeared in the midst of the Remo's and fate
played it's fickle hand. Sylverion's appearance seemed to startle the giant
worm-like beasts and one attacked Sylverion and it's deadly maw was wrapped
around Sylverion's torso before he could even react. In one long gulp,
Sylverion was gone. The Gods of KAAOS laughed! Yet they knew the battle
was far from over. Fumbles, Stink Clouds, and holds flew as the BDA'ers
tried to overcome their one man deficit. Slayve and Azimer cornered Modalex
from the others and quickly set about pummeling him. He was nearly dead
as he Dimension Door'd away to catch his breath. Slayve quickly followed
with a DD of his own, as he would not be denied his kill. Meanwhile, Kholari
came under the effects of Rellik's Hold spell and things looked grim until
Sagx freed his Held companion. Hedron cast Lightning at Sagx and Kh0lari,
but both Globes were still intact. Sagx and Kholari quickly surrounded
Hedron and started battering him with their deadly drow magic.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Hedron staggered free and headed for the gravely
wounded Modalex. He would get one kill in before his own demise, he vowed.
As Kholari ran back to Hedron, Azimer and Slayve once again surrounded
Modalex and repeated their deadly assault on the wounded Drow. Hedron,
sensing his death was near, unleashed a final devastating blow to Kholari
just as the drow sent him to the gate. No sooner had Hedron fallen, than
Azimer delivered the killing blow to Modalex. Kholari now sorely wounded
tried to Hold Slayve, Azimer and Rellikk but failed. After an ill placed
attack by Slayve, Sir Rellik's nine inch serrated dagger ended Kholari's
time in the battle and the Gods smiled, now knowing it was but a matter
of time. Sagx sent a Lightning Bolt through Slayve and Rellik, but they
retaliated with magic of their own and Sagx ran for cover under their deadly
assault. The chase was on! Sagx's guerilla takes proved effective for a
few rounds, but once surrounded, he was quickly overwhelmed. Azimer, Rellik
and Slayve battered him down and in a final scream of &quot;KAAOS!!!&quot;,
Sagx's bloody body was sent gateward and the Gods of KAAOS stood victorious!&quot;</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">The children remained silent for a second more,
then let out a boisterous, wild cheer. They jumped up and down and started
a &quot;mock PVP&quot; amongst themselves. They laughed and shouted as
the images of the legendary battle were still fresh in their minds. The
young boy on the old man's lap merely looked at him, &quot;What happened
then?&quot; he asked innocently. The old man took the boy from his knee
and raised his weary bones to stand. &quot;That is a question which only
the future may know the answer to. There shall be other struggles and there
shall be other warriors to test the mettle of KAAOS in the future, and
other tales shall be told about those battles too. Be patient young one,
the best is yet to come.&quot; said the old man as he picked up his wineskin.
The boy pondered a moment, and jumped up excitedly, &quot;Thanks mister!&quot;
he yelled and bolted to where his friends were still playing.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">From beneath his hooded cloak, the old man's
mouth formed into a sinister grin as he stood upright, dropped the wineskin
to the ground and sight returned to his eyes. He pulled the hood back and
anyone who would have been watching from the shadows would have seen Doc
Krypto there, laughing, and reveling in the glory of KAAOS.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">As darkness began to fall over the realms,
with it, the sounds of the creatures of the night began to grow louder.
The sounds of men hunting the dangerous creatures and beasts, the sounds
of the these beasts hunting the men, the sounds of battle, the sounds of
pain, the sounds of bloodshed, and most importantly, the sounds of evil
deeds in progress.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Amongst these sounds, one other distinct and
unmistakable sound could be heard. </FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">The sound of KAAOS.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Their group, consisting of seven Gods and one
Goddess, was on the prowl. Whereever they went, death followed close behind.
A trail of bloody footprints could be seen marking the soft earth of the
Neverwinter Woods as the group moved away from the scene of another of
their merciless slaughters. </FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">As they moved away from the carnage, everyone
turned to glance back at their work one last time.. a pile of six mutilated
corpses.. two of them charred beyond recognition, and one no more than
a pile of bones and ashes. Puddles of blood pooled on the ground around
the bodies and all around, rocks and trees were spotted with the crimson
red droplets of these unfortunate travellers. One of the corpses clothes
seemed to be missing also, the result of some perverted act also. </FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">The group of KAAOSers began moving on, but
for some reason, Slayve was eyeing War Knight and his face was twisted
into a demonic looking sneer. The two had a few words and then Slayve pushed
War Knight away and they began heading back to the KAAOS Hell Hole. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Once back at the Hell Hole, everyone began bragging about their take of
Souls for the evening. The Dreadlord was fiddling with his serrated dagger
and slashing across the air, reenacting a morbid scene in front of the
kneeling slaves, ITB Legion and ITB Silver. </FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">In the middle of the large hall, though, War
Knight and Slayve were pushing each other again. They were yelling back
and forth about who had rights to the soul of one of the wusses they had
killed. As the pushes became shoves, the rest of the room began to break
up into two factions around the two bickering Gods.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Kal Mirage, Ego Prime and Xylina all moved
behind War Knight, while Sir Rellik, Tyo Ark and Krynal gather behind Slayve.
Then everyone began yelling back and forth at everyone else soon enough
everyone was pushing everyone. Just as it seemed as if it was about to
come to some nice honest fighting to settle the dispute, War Knight raised
his hand and spoke in his loud booming voice, &quot;There is only one way
to settle this..&quot;</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Turning, he pointed to the corner where a large
keg of his finest ale sat. Everyone traded looks of confusion until War
threw a large mug at Slayve. The demon God snatched the mug out of the
air and pushed his way through the mass of KAAOSers, but instead of tapping
the keg, he just looked at his mug.. and it filled with a dark murky liquid
with tendril of smoke rising off of it.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Everyone began to understand and they all fetched
different liquids and substances, mugs, shot glasses, and the like. Within
seconds, shots were being downed, new kegs were being tapped, people were
yelling back and forth and slamming their mugs down as they called for
the slaves to bring them more.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">ITB Legion hurriedly supplied the Dreadlord's
team with more drinks, while ITB Silver ran back and forth trying to keep
all of Kal's team's glasses full. Insults were being thrown every which
way, along with empty mugs and other containers. </FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Then the first casualties began to occurr.
Xylina threw down three more shots of a red, glowing liquid, but then she
started to fall back in her chair. The sound of Sir Rellik laughing at
her, &quot;Heh! Heh!,&quot; brought her back to her senses long enough
for her to shoot him an icy stare and hurl all three shot glasses, in succession,
at the Dreadlord's head. One after another, all three hit Rellik right
in between the eyes. Then in unison, the both of them fell to the floor,
slipping under the table.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Next to go was Tyo Ark. After having downed
another mug of War's ale, he leaned back in his chair, two feet off the
ground, then he belched. The walls shook with the might of his expulsion
of the gaseous bubble in his stomach. The force of the vibrations caused
his chair to rock back and his head slammed against the stone floor. His
eyes rolled back into his head and blood started pooring from his nose.
</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Followed by the vibrations of his belch, was
a hideous odor. Everyone else's noses furrowed and tehy shook it off. All
except War Knight, who was holding a large keg of ale of his head and chugging
it. The foul odor caused his knees to buckle and he fell to the floor.
The keg slipped from his hands and came crashing down right on his head,
then he flopped to the floor with a thump, his head buried inside the keg.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Slayve started to smirk and called Ego over
for a moment. Ego wondered what was going on but followed anyways. Then
Slayve bent over and another loud noise rocked the Hell Hole, followed
by an even fouler odor. Kal and Krynal dove under the tables to stay out
of the direct path of the very deadly cloud of gas that had been created.
Ego Prime couldnt escape though. He inhaled deeply and the fell face first
to the ground, landing right on top of ITB Silver. Ego pinned her to the
ground and held her there as he slipped into consciousness. </FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Slayve, however, let out another loud sound,
however this time it was more than just gas. With a pained look on his
face, he ran from the room, howling and swearing in some sort of harsh
demonic tongue. As the air cleared and the smell disipated, only Kal Mirage
and Krynal remained.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Both of these two gods kept slammed down mugs
of ale and shots of powerful soulspritzers. Many times it looked as if
Kal was about to fall back in his chair, but he kept holding his own against
Krynal. Then when it seemed like neither of them would ever succumb to
the liquor, Krynal started to cough and sputter, then ducked his head under
the table. </FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Kal Mirage slammed down one last drink as Krynal
continued to puke and vomit all over the Hell Hole floor. When the sounds
of his puking stopped, he just collapsed under the table. Kal then stood
up and raised his mug, proclaiming their victory to his fallen comrades.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">He then walked over and lifted his passed out
wife into his arms, then grabbed a bottle of some blue liquid and headed
off into the slightly cleaner and less smelling confines of the Hell Hole,
leaving a room full of drunken, passed out Gods under the table. </FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">As Kal carried Xylina into his chambers and
flopped her down onto the bed, the only other sounds he could hear throughout
the Hell Hole were the sounds of ITB Silver pleaing for help and Slayve
growling in frustration as he ran back and forth down the hallway every
few moments, followed by a disgusting fecal odor. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~ KAAOS Team
