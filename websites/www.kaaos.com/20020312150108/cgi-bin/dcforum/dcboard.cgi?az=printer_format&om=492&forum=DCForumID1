What is the max size going to be on those NWN servers? I heard 64 or something like that. Doesn't allow for alot of guild to guild interaction.<P><BR>SangDraxx<BR>KAAOS<BR>The Serpent Lord<P><BR>

<blockquote>
64 per server...  yes...<P>but there are going to be many many servers...  we already are at 8...  and we've been live for 48 hours...  it's not a true MMORPG...  it's just not built for that...  but if there is a way to up the players, we will...  It just has such a great toolset option with the DM control, it's impossible to pass up...<P>Shadowbane looks great...  but for obvious reasons (I've been using the name Shade Shadowbane online for 7 years or so), I'm boycotting it :-P<P>Really...  I may look into it at a later date, though...
