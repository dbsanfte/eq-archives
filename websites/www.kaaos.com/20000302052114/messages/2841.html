Shadow you dumb fucking mooly.  To get to me you have to get through the KAAOS front line, and thats not gonna happen.  By the time your reach me you'll have found that the Front Line has pierced your body with new orafices and Im gonna fuck everyone of them boy.<br><p>Go back to sucking on Thyrms tit, your not done nursing yet, let alone old enough to fight.<br><br>Ego<p><br>: I'll be there as well.  I'm not much of a violent person, but when it comes to my friends - you fuck with them, you fuck with me.  I'll fucking drive or fly anywhere if it means I can kick the shit out of these pathetic motherfuckers who talk all this shit and then fucking log off when they run out of shit to say.  I personally hope EgoPrime comes.  After I beat his ass, I'd take a picture of the bloody pulp that would be and stick it on the back of my Audi right above the license plate that says "KAAOS" which I stole off of the poor gimp's corvette.<p>: Shadowalker - Let's fucking roll..<p>
