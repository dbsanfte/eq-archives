True, I wish it was 2nd edition rules. I prefer the saving throw table, where a 1 is failure and 20 is autosuccess, to the new scale where I've seen a fighter with a base Fortitude save 10 points higher than my strongest 9th level death spell.

Monks aren't fully magic resistant, they're 50% resistant, and that can be reduced with spell breaches and Mords disjunction. Sorcerer's aren't as powerful as wizards due to a wizard's diversity in the things he can do in combat, whereas a Sorcerer is limited to 4 spells a spell level. If anything, a cleric is the one that's almost overpowered. For example, surviving their destruction spell, you then take 10d6 worth of damage. They're huge in fortitude and will, but extremely weak in reflex. Most mage strategy has to do with metamagic and unsavable spells. You appeal to the lowest common denominator of your opponents known class(es).

You're right on a lot of those issues, but all those strengths have weaknesses. The only true magekiller class is the Monk, but he can be killed also with the right tactic, which I'm thinking of right now. 

Basically comes down to knowing your individual opponents, rather than knowing the limitations of a specific set of classes. There was one person who was using some old equipment from when the game was first brought up, a fighter 18/rogue 2, who was killing everything because he could read from 9th level scrolls. We balanced that a bit, and among other things, it's shaping up nicely.

Overall, personally, I'm impressed with it a whole helluva lot more than EQ, AC2, UO, and SB. Even if you don't play under your KAAOS name, it's still worth checking out to see if you like it. Unfortunately, it's NOT 2nd edition rules, and you've gotta adjust accordingly.
