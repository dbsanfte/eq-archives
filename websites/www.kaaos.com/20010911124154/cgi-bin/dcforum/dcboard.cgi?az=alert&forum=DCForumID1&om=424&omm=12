Have you EVER played ANY multi-team strategy game?

Are you aware that the first two to start fighting are usually the first two out of the game?

It's simply fucking strategy and mechanics you fucking DOLT.  Are you SO dense that these issue elude you?  This is precisely why YOU are a waste of time.  All of the guilds that AREN'T a waste of time are not strutting around trying to fuck themselves.  They're leveling.

If we pause to beat the ever-living fuck out of you and your crew of bozos, other people who are gunning for us will get a 5 to 10 level advantage on us.  Do you understand EQ PVP?  Do you know that fighting a bunch of people with a 10 level advantage on you = suicide?  Do you realize that at this stage of the game levels are coming at a rate of 2 to 4 per day for those who are busting ass?

4 days off from leveling to beat the shit out of you so badly that you can't deny it = 8 to 16 level gap between us and those who don't take that time off.  That means that when we move into areas to level, we'll be contested by people who out level us heavily, and leveling will drop to a much slower rate due to the opposition, and xp loss at dying. You'll never catch up to the curve.

What does that all add up to for losers that stop and fight each other now?  It adds up to constant death and enforced mediocrity.

50's = REAL guild PVP.
10's and 20's = Stupid newbs.

You're a dumb ass. (laughing)  Now your lesson is over.  Go away.

Oh, and by the way.  Sometimes we do use specific words for things in the "PVP Community", but there's no fucking way you would know what they are - because you ain't in it.

Have a happy happy day. :)
