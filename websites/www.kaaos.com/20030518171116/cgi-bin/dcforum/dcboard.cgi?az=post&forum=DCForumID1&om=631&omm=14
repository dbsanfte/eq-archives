         <blockquote>
         UO was a poor example of a PvP system. I will give it this though, it was at least mildly entertaining in the early days. <P>1 on 1 fights in UO’s system were linear though. Given two equally skilled opponents, the victor was the person who didn’t mess up their timing of extremely repetitious keyboard pouncing. 1 on 1 fights between two equally skilled opponents was pretty boring. I remember before Pharismod was KAAOS, he was an “enemy” of KAAOS. We ran into each other in a dungeon (I think it was Deceit) and commenced to fighting. At this time there was never a cordial word between KAAOS and Pharismod. I wouldn’t go so far as to use the term hate but there was an extreme amount of hostility between him and us. While we were at each other’s throats on the boards for several months, this was the first time Pharismod and a KAAOSer actually faced off in the field. So you see, winning this fight was pretty important to both Pharismod and myself. We fought for what seemed like hours. The whole time we were verbally assaulting each other, each trying to get the other out of synch. This drug on for so ridiculously long that we both started to get extremely bored. Eventually 2 gimps came up to us to “watch” the fight. Well, Pharismod and I both turned on them and burned them down then began fighting each other again. After about another 20 minutes (and dancing back and forth over pretty much the entire dungeon) we both agreed the fight was pretty pointless. We stopped fighting and Pharismod gave me a lift back to town. Oh the inanity of it all.<P>Group fights were different. In UO, group fights would be over very quickly. Focus fire made short work of large groups. There wasn’t much skill involved though, it was a basic number scenario. The group that could gain the number advantage would win. If your group was smaller than the other group you had to make sure that you didn’t lose anyone before you could better the odds. <P>As I said, early UO was at least “entertaining” but it was not a very good system. Nothing since UO has been any better but that still doesn’t make UO a good example of PvP. UO was fun because of macroing and looting. Looting only works in a game like UO because equipment is readily available and easily attainable. There were counter-tactics in UO but not many, not compared to oNWN. UO is a basic example of mindless PvP. <P>Azmodion<BR>KAAOS
