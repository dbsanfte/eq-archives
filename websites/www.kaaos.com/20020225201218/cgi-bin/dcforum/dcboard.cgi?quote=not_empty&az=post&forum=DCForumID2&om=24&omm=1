         <blockquote>
         As the cloaked rider trotted along the heavily forested path the cool night air seemed to get cooler. The darkness seemed to get darker. His mount, a well trained steed, snorted and started to prance about nervously. The rider, no stranger to battle, felt the hairs on the back of his neck give rise. Something amiss, yet there was no sound......strange....no sound. No sound at all. Nothing. He couldn’t even hear his horse's hooves clacking with each nervous step. It was as if the world was suddenly devoid of sound. The darkness seemed to close in on him as he reigned his mount to a halt. Though he knew he was outdoors, the feeling was claustrophobic, as if he was locked, scrunched, in a box. Standing in his stirrups he peered into the darkness as he held a short reign on his nervous mount. Nothing.......not a damn thing. The darkness was overwhelming. The quiet, engulfing. The rider reached for his sword, hilt worn from countless battles.....the distinctive ring of the weapon exiting the scabbard gave calm. Sound had apparently not left the world. Just then his keen senses picked up a faint metallic ting sound and a slight whisper of air being dispersed...a whisper moving quickly towards him. He wheeled his mount, ready to face his aggressor, when he caught sight of a small glint of metal arching towards him. He reached up and snatched the glint of metal from the air. He lowered his arm, turned his palm up, and opened his hand. He held a single gold coin, a coin with markings the likes he’d never seen before. Perplexed, he stared at the coin.<P>“My my, you must be blessed, to have coins fall from the heavens upon thee”<P>The rider jerked his head up and tried to face his mount in the direction of the voice but it seemed to be coming from every direction. “Who are you? And more importantly...where are you?”<P>“Who am I? Why I’m an insignificant old man, you need not fear me. As for where I am.....why, I am right in front of you”<P>The rider looked down from his mount and saw an old man with dusty tattered robes before him, where there was nobody a moment ago. The rider spat “fool old man, you’ll be trampled standing out in the middle of the path like that”.<P>“I know them you know”<P>“You know who?” asked the rider.<P>“Those which you believed you saw”<P>“I’ve no time for riddles old man, either speak clearly or step aside lest I run ye down”.<P>“Ah, the impatience of youth....I think you know to whom I refer. They aren’t what you may believe they are.”<P>“How do you mean?”<P>The old man gestured towards his feet, what the rider saw could only be described as a shell of a man. A badly deformed man, mumbling incoherently as he groveled in the dirt. The man looked up and the rider saw the terrible face. An eyeless face scared beyond recognition.<P>“What is this old man?”<P>“This, my friend, was once a mighty warrior, much like yourself. He too sought those whom you seek.”<P>“What happened to him?”<P>“His search was successful, he was shown KAAOS, true KAAOS. What he saw was more than his mortal eyes could bear I’m afraid. He gouged his own eyes out so as not to have to look upon the horror. To late though, his mind was irreparably warped beyond comprehensive sanity.” <P>“Bah, weak fool. I’ve seen horrors beyond explanation, most cause by my own sword” grinned the rider.<P>The old man started to laugh, a quiet laugh yet it seemed to engulf the world around them. “My young friend, is that what you think KAAOS is? Hacking off a few limbs? Slaying a few warriors? Disemboweling a few whores perhaps? No no my friend, KAAOS is not about simple mortality, simple killing. Why that’s child’s play.” <P>“I shy away from no man, from no fight. I enter battle without fear, without remorse. I’ve killed more men than you could fathom old man and I’m not about to turn back now.”<P>The old man waived his hand in dismissal “yes yes, the fearless warrior, laying waste to those who oppose him. But are you prepared to pay the price? There is no turning back. Once you look upon KAAOS the price will be paid. You either become what you seek or you become this miserable wretch beneath my feet.” <P>“I’ve already looked upon KAAOS and it’s nothing I need shy away from.” <P>“FOOL! You saw NOTHING. You saw what they wanted you to see. You can’t begin to imagine what lies beneath the Hell Hole. The torture is indescribable, the pain insufferable.....and it is without end. Your mortal life is but a fleck of sand. There is no pain that can be caused to your mortal body in a lifetime that could compare to the pain that can be caused to your soul within the first few moments you are cast into the Hell Hole. And this is a pain that will last for eternity. They will feast upon your soul and if you are not strong enough you will become much less than this....this wretched excuse for a lump of flesh.” The old man kicked the mumbling eyeless wretch who didn’t seem to notice or feel a thing.<P>The rider laughed “Pain? I know all about pain. And suffering? I am suffering incarnate! I am more than a man old fool and I will not be denied.”<P>“We shall see young one.....we shall see”<P>With that there was a clash of sudden sound, of sudden awareness. The world returned, the night returned, the cool air returned to just that..... The old man was gone, the eyeless wretch was gone. All that was left was the single gold coin which the rider still clutched within his fist.........<P>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<P>“You and that damned gold coin Azmodion” smirked Hedron.<P>“Ah but that coin has served me well dear Hedron. The lure of fortune has always kept my hunger satiated. Feasting on the bittersweet taste of misfortune which lingers on the soul is my one true vice I must admit.” <P>Hedron raised an eyebrow “You know, I’ve always found vices to be a display of weakness”<P>“Don’t push me Hedron” scowled Azmodion.<P>Hedron simply laughed at what Azmodion didn’t seem to find amusing.<P><BR>Azmodion<BR>Lord of Misery<BR>KAAOS God of Misfortune
