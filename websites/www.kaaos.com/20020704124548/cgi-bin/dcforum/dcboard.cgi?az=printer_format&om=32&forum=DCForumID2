Holy poop on a stick. You actually managed to post more than 5 words.<BR> You have further confirmed my suspicions that you are a small, chubby white child in a suburban home, driving Daddies station wagon with gangsta rap on the radio. This your idea of roleplay, gimp?<BR> Pathetic, not that I expected any better. You want into KAAOS, try making an effort. Otherwise, I'm happy to kick you down like the other humps.<BR>Seek life elsewhere.<BR>kthx<BR>Judas

Hey Dipshit, post your sexual fantasies of little boys in the pit forum, this is the RP forum, and we all know that you really do have sex with little boys, so you aren't roleplaying. You aren't evil, you are just demented.<P>suck it<BR>Mothball

I'd rather take my insults from someone who doesnt cut and paste rap songs as an attempt at roleplaying.<BR>Fuck you and drive on through.<BR>kthx.<BR>Judas
