<blockquote>**Apparently your site's form mail is bouncing.  I this is a copy/paste of my join request**<P>I would have put through this request sooner but I found myself quite<BR>tired after the drowning of a troup of 6 year old brownie scouts one by one in<BR>the blood of their own slaughtered schnauser puppies.  I plan to play shadowbane<BR>as an Irekei Assassin Black Mask Sun Dancer Sorcerer primarily.  Nothing whets<BR>my appetite more than to visualize myself inflicting a massive scourge of bloody<BR>gore and dismemberment upon the weak.  I am fiercly loyal to those deemed only<BR>the most viscious and merciless in their exploits of the inferior.  Your Guild<BR>boasts of the fulfillment of such atrocities with the utmost precision and raw<BR>power.  I humbly offer my services to your organization.  I can assure you that<BR>I am a dedicated and feverishly practiced game player with blood on my taste<BR>buds and a black void for a soul.  I look forward to hearing from you.  Thank<BR>you and good day.<P>-salohcin<P>P.S. check this out <a href="http://sbvault.ign.com/features/polls/guild25.shtml" target="_blank">http://sbvault.ign.com/features/polls/guild25.shtml</a></blockquote><hr><b><font size=2>Table of contents</font></b><hr>

I believe you are mistaken. You prey on the weak. KAAOS preys on the strong, and makes them look weak. When you quit picking on girl scouts and start picking on the greatest mercenary guilds around, then you may be worthy.<P>And we can see by your link exactly how you came to your conclusion to try and join KAAOS. Learn some dedication, joining a guild because they finished first in a poll shows how little you actually care about joining a quality guild.<P>Mortarion<BR><i>The god of death and decay</i>

Actually, I have never felt the need to join KAAOS, therefore I am not a member. I just like watching the newbies run for cover.<P>And as far as that scene from fight club, the guy went away crying until the alter ego comforted him. Is Hedron my alter ego? heh.<P>Go and cry or do you have more girl scouts to pick on?<P>Mortarion<BR><i>The god of death and decay</i>

"Actually, I have never felt the need to join KAAOS, therefore I am not a member."<P>Well isn't that a convenient rationalization to justify your mediocrity.<P>"Go and cry or do you have more girl scouts to pick on?"<P>It was just a joke man.  Don't take things so literally.  With the combination of forum stress and the lack of a girlfriend, you're going to have serious health problems.  Take a few deep breaths, cradle your small penis in your had gently, and go FUCK OFF!!! hehehe
