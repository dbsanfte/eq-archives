         Artificial means of making a PvP win hurt the winner are... stupid.  Very stupid.  Analogy: Hey, social security didn't work for shit guys.. lets throw 300 billion more into it.  <P>In meridian the winners of PvP were hurt, because it was a small knit community, and people got pissed off when someone else was the king of the mountain.  Once almost our entire server ganged up on my guild because we were seen as the 'strongest' guild on the server.  That's how winning should hurt.  Not faction loss bullshit, or guards magically appearing to destroy you in a single blow.  Not that you can't teleport for the next hour, or that anyone else can therein kill you without a penalty for an hour.  All bullshit.  No other game since Meridian had a good guild system.  Meridian had guild halls that carried prestige, guild tournaments (My guild won a tournament shortly before half the server ganged us), and the like.  <P>Jealousy, hatred, pride.  These are what make losing hurt less and winning 'hurt more'.<P>Shadowbane with it's guild towns and system where guilds can build and maintain world-wide recognition and prestige will create it's own non artificial methods for those losers to deal with those 'winning bastards' (hah! :p).  It's not a dev issue.  So far I don't see Shadowbane developing any (too) artificial means of making the losers feel better.  That's good, they (losers) can make themselves feel better that way.<P>Another thing.  3do, the makers of meridian, had fucking shit for customer support and in game "guides" to bitch at.  Players dealt with shit themselves, they didn't (COULDN'T) run to the skirts of the company hosting the world.  You were put on hold for an hour if you even dared called 3do, then usually told that they didn't deal with in game problems other than hacking and bugs.<BR>
