<P><FONT COLOR="#800000"><B><I><FONT SIZE=+3>K</FONT></I></B><FONT SIZE=+1>AAOS
is the Premier Guild of Evil Role Players and PVP'ers in Neverwinter Nights.
Our guild of Gods and Goddesses primary goal is the corruption of the innocent
and the destruction of all that is good. First, and foremost, KAAOS has
no rules. A character's own role-play style and personal plans of conquest
are highly treasured amongst KAAOS. We do not lay rule upon rule on you.
Truly Chaotic individuals would not thrive in an environment where limitations
and constraints disrupt the spirit of free-reigning evil.</FONT></FONT></P>

<CENTER><P><B><I><FONT COLOR="#008080"><FONT SIZE=+2>KAAOS' GOALS<BR>
</FONT></FONT></I></B><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=+1>We desire to
promote an atmosphere of foreboding terror, fear, and lust in which KAAOS
thrives! We will destroy any group or individuals who stand in our way.
This usually entails frequently executing those of Good alignments and
those that require or follow Law and order in their lives. We will also
attack and destroy ANYone who seeks to hinder our progress and objectives.</FONT></FONT></P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=+1>Alignment is NOT a concern
when our goals are threatened. KAAOS desires your soul...and blood...and
we will have it at any cost.</FONT></FONT>

MEMBER</FONT></FONT></I></B></P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=+1>KAAOS is unlike most Guilds
in it's recruitment of members. First, you must be of any alignment other
than Good. Second, you must be &quot;sponsored&quot; into the Guild. This
means you must &quot;catch our attention&quot; on-line and either ask to
be sponsored (by ESP or E-Mail), or a Guild member will ask if you'd like
to be sponsored.</FONT></FONT></P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=+1>Your PVP skills and/or evil
role play ability will be the determining factors in your worthiness to
be KAAOS. Once you are sponsored, you will be contacted on the next phase
of admittance, to see if you have the merit (and stomach! or spleen!) to
be KAAOS! We take great pride in being the best PVP'ers in the Realms,
and having some of the best evil role players the lands have ever known.
If you are unwilling or unable to be proficient in both, go join a wuss
guild. Quantity of members is not our primary concern.</FONT></FONT></P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=+1>KAAOS is a team of individual
characters banded together to bring glory to the spirit of KAAOS. We invade
the realms to enjoy ourselves. Special events such as KAAOS HotTub parties
and Hot Dog Steaming contests are legendary in their wickedness! The KAAOS
Hell Hole is where our members live and meet to plan out our depravities.
The Hell Hole features indoor and outdoor running slaves, free flowing
soul spritzers, a large tequila collection, a secret recipe for salsa,
the infamous KAAOS&nbsp;Train, and one of the realms most feared objects...the
Spiked Boot of KAAOS!</FONT></FONT></P></CENTER>

KAAOS</FONT></FONT></P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P><BR>
<FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=+1>KAAOS- The god damn pit. The center
of hell. The evil boiling in the hidden chamber of the heart that doesn't
show up in any x-ray.</FONT></FONT></P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=+1>KAAOS is a seething pot
of blood. Gods and Goddesses are dropped into it on a fucking thread that
breaks as they hit the surface. You fucking sink or swim, biotch. Sink
or fucking swim.</FONT></FONT></P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=+1>What's that mean? GOD DAMNIT!
It means you better not buckle. I mean you better not fucking buckle. Not
to anyone in the realms. If someone is in your face, you're in his. No,
let me clarify. If someone is in your face, you rip your face off and pour
blood all over his body before you decimate him like a balloon full of
oatmeal blasted apart by ten tons of KAAOS Salsa pumped out in a ten ton
Godload.</FONT></FONT></P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=+1>If a KAAOSER is in your
face, you better walk careful. Walk careful, but you better not buckle.
I mean you better not fucking buckle.</FONT></FONT></P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=+1>So what's to be careful
of there? Sounds like the same old bullshit over again... and you're reaching
for your face to rip it off... and you're loading up the Salsa Engine.</FONT></FONT></P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=+1>I SAID WALK CAREFUL. Walk
careful because you're sitting across from somebody who's about to rip
off their own face, and KAAOS has the kind of skull you don't wanna see.</FONT></FONT></P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=+1>But what the fuck, man?
We're a guild. Drench the new gods in blood and cut them open and all you're
left with is that sagging empty balloon.</FONT></FONT></P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=+1>But that's ok. This is KAAOS.
That's what we specialize in. As you elder gods sit across from those struggling
to rise, and you slice them apart, you're feeling the evil course through
your veins. FUCK YEAH!</FONT></FONT></P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=+1>But ask yourselves, as you
raise that knife to slice the skin off that bullshit pissant newbie god,
&quot;If this one doesn't bleed... if it doesn't bleed a drop, but instead
raises its own knife to strike me&quot;, what then?</FONT></FONT></P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=+1>Like tigers, you gang of
fucking rapists, we eat our young. We smash them in our teeth and pick
them out later. But I'll tell you, when I lift a child god into the air
and tear a pound of flesh from the naked child-gods back, I watch it. And
when I see it stand, shake off the pain, and tear an ounce of flesh out
of my leg, THAT, gods and godesses, is a fucking God ready to be discovered.
I kick it to the side and leave to blossom into pure evil.</FONT></FONT></P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=+1>That child god is one I
want to see grow up and tear a pound of flesh out of HIS children. The
ones that mewe like kittens and roll away to slowly bleed and pout, are
the ones I smash beneath my boot...they can get the fuck out.</FONT></FONT></P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=+1>Posting finese comes as
long as the underlying talent is there. PVP finese comes as long as the
underlying talent is there. What NEVER shows later is the heart of evil,
the cunning of death, and the pulse of a god. If a child god has all these,
then it will grow into a true god in all ways. Stop looking for ready mades.</FONT></FONT></P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=+1>Those ready mades only show
that at some point they learned to post, at some point they learned to
PVP, and came to us like a moth to a flame. They knew where the real evil
was. They knew where they could tear the skin off their brethren, crack
his bones like a twig, and have that mother fucker enjoy it. But the real
ones are few and far between. Fuck them.</FONT></FONT></P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=+1>And hey, Fuck that. We're
KAAOS. Fucking worship that.</FONT></FONT></P></CENTER>
