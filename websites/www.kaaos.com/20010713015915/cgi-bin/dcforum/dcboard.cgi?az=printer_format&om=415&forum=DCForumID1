<blockquote>Well shit, I thought that by now you would have all sodomized each other to death!  But here you still are, working steadily toward that goal as always.  I wish I could come over to the new PVP server on EQ and renew the rivalries of the old days, but realtime PVP just doesn't have the appeal for me.  I'm on the Cazic-Thule server with the two guys I started SOL with (Abyss and Sun), as well as a few other old SOL's.  Soldiers of Light is still around, but I haven't had anything to do with them since I left NWN.  To be honest, my best memories of NWN involve KAAOS, either fighting for or against.  I don't think too many of ya knew I had a KAAOSer other than Mal and Rellik.  His name was Prospal and his only real purpose was to put yet another KAAOS God in the top ten on the PVP Ladder, although Lumen was always above him &lt;G&gt;  Anyway, I heard my guild eventually turned to shit after Abyss and I left.  I don't know if it's true or not, but it was repectable while we were in charge.  Too bad poor leadership took over, from what I've heard.  Anyway, with all the new MMORPG's coming out, maybe one of them will have a decent PVP environment.  Hell, maybe I'll even roll up a Troll Warrior and come over the the new PVP server to hang out with some old friends, but I still don't get much out of PVP in EQ.  By the way, didn't some of you move to Nashville right around the demise of NWN?  Wasn't it Doomers and Hedron?  I know Drk Anjel used to live here.  Not sure if she still does.  I moved up here about a year ago, so I'd like to hear if there's any of ya close.  I've got a wife and kid now, so it would be good to know what parts of town to keep em away from! &lt;G&gt;<P>Lumen<P>P.S. - Let me respond to some of your replies ahead of time...<P>No, you suckit!<BR>No, I will not bbbbllllllooooowwwwwwww you!<BR>No, YOU worship it.<BR>YeahsureshateverImawussjustshutthefuckup.<BR>Yes, I know you wish you could have found my mother while she was pregnant just so you could rip a hole in her abdomen and fuck me up the ass while I was still a fetus.  Real sorry we both missed out on that one &lt;G&gt;<P>And for those of you too green to know who the hell I am, I earned the respect of KAAOS a long time ago as a goodie, and then I earned it as a fellow GOD, so take any wise-ass newb comments you can muster up, shove them directly up your overstretched asshole, and go fuck yourself.  <P>Finally, I would like to end with: WHHHHHHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!</blockquote><hr><b><font size=2>Table of contents</font></b><hr>

Well well, if it isn't STFU Lumen. Haven't seen your gimp ass since the last ass whooping you took in NWN.

Let’s get technical gimp. First of all anals is not a word, it’s spelled annals. Secondly “annals of KAAOS history” is redundant you stupid cunt. Do you even know what annals means? You mean to tell me you come here to correct me?....ME?!! And you don’t even know what the word means. <P>What I find most amusing is that you’ve been worshiping at our temple long enough.....You should know by now that if you are going to correct me, me of all people, you had better be SURE of what you are correcting. <P>And as far as my testosterone, testosterone has nothing to do with anything. You think I give a fuck about what you think about me? You think I give a fuck about who’s gay or what “looks gay”? This isn’t happy, skippy, fairy land. I don’t give a fuck about anything except spitting on your rotting corpse. You post here at your own risk. If you come here you better accept the fact that we would just assume piss on you as look at you. I don’t give a fuck about you, I don’t give a fuck about “old buds”, and I certainly don’t give a fuck about your precious sensitivities. You can take your little holier than thou attitude and shove it up your ass. <P>As far as my reply to Lumen, if he truly was a KAAOSer then he understands my post. <P>You on the other hand are a dumb ass and you obviously have no shame, because if you cared about yourself on any level you would do yourself a favor and put a bullet in your head. <P>Azmodion<BR>KAAOS

Uhh, why are you telling me your opinion of Abyss?  Why would I give a fuck what you thought of him?  And Lumen was his lap dog?  Maybe you're admittedly faulty memory is confusing me with one of his underlings after he was given the reigns of SOL upon my departure.  It sounds like there isn't anything that was very memorable to you.  Of course, my "impression" could have been worse.  I could be remembered as ITB Lumen.  &lt;G&gt;<P>~l

LOL, Met, I have a feeling you're going to get a few questions for letting that cat out of the bag.  We recruited the top PVPers in NWN when I was starting the guild, and at one point we had quite a few of them.  I generally don't reveal who rolled up SOL characters but there were a large number that would really have surprised people.  This was one of them &lt;G&gt;<P>Lumen

&gt;Prospal sucked as bad in <BR>&gt;PvP as Lumen <P>ROFL, your worship is accepted.  I didn't come here proclaiming to be a great PVP'er, but since you bring it up...<P>Before I left NWN I had 4 different characters in the top ten on the PVP ladder at the same time, and Lumen was #1. So at any given point almost half of the top 10 PVP'ers in NWN were...ME!!  And I sucked??  ROFL, you fucking ignorant shitstain. <P>OK, I'll predict your witty retort..."The PVP ladder didn't mean shit!"  Take a look at the "Annals" of which Prospal is not mentioned (the NWN Trophy Room in particular) and take note of "how little they mean" there.  I couldn't help but notice the name "Azmodion" was not on display.  However, I can guarantee you that Lumen proved himself against all the people that ARE listed there, and was above them for months straight at the top of the ladder.  So while you're telling me how much I sucked, you might as well tell all the Gods that were ranked below me that they sucked as well.<P>LOL, I win, you lose.  Some things never change.  <P>I'd tell ya to blow me, but yer not worth my fucking godly wad.<P>Lumen - Singles Ladder Champion  <BR>
