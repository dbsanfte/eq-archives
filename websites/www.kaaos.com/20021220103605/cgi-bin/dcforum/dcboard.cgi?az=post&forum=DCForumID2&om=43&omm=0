           <BR> "Captain, beg to report sir." the soldier requested.<BR> <BR>"Make it quick lieutenant." Commander Gretch replied.<P>"Sir, we still hold the walls.  The enemy has been unable to breach and we have ample supplies to continue the defending.." the soldier paused for a moment and a worried look crossed his face.  "Sir, We also know that the bulk of the army has not even arrived..."<P>  "Lieutenant, we all know what our enemy is capable of.  Its bloody damn likley that none of us will leave these walls ever again, but I'll be damned if I intend to just walkaway and let KAAOS take away everything our people have worked for."  Gretch turned to stare at the young lieutenant. "Back to your post, keep me informed."<P>  "Very well sir." the soldier replied as he turned and made his way along the battlements.<P>  The scene stretching before the commander was horrific.  The killing fields surrounding the walled city looked like a sea of insects as wave apon wave of demon spawn continued the assault.  They had taken heavy casualties in the first few hours of the battle but had slowly began recover.  Even though he believed he could hold off the thousands in front of him, he also knew that the KAAOS gods themselves had yet to join the fray.  When that happend, he would pray.  Its all he knew he could do...<P>  "Rellik, the spawn are being repelled at every turn.  It is as we planned.."  Nurlging stated sardonically.  <P>  "Let them have their hopes... So much the better when we collect their souls."  the False Prophet chuckled.<P>  "Yes, the well has been lookin a tad shallow lately.  New souls will do it right up nicely me thinks."  spoke the shadows.<P>  "My undead legions grow weary of all this waiting, on with it I say."  Blayloc demanded.  "And why in the hell does it require all of us to take down this pathetic collection of stone and flesh?"<P>  "Call it an example.  We want to let everyone know that yes, we are here and we are watching. Nothing escapes our notice, and nothing is beyond our grasp."  the God of Misery, Azmodion said.<P>  " I think we should begin the second phase of the attack, I'm begining to tire of this charade."  the shadows stated. <P>  "Yes let us send the real fodder before us, and clear away all of this nonsense."  Tyo said with an edge of eagerness in his voice.<P>  Hedron buried the twisted cross in the ground.  One after another, Turmoyle, Sangdraxx, Ego Prime and the rest of the gods lifted a hand towards the fortress.  Their grins betrayed their malicious intent and more then one chuckled at the thoughts of what was to come.<P>  "Now this should be interesting..." Kal Mirage said while trying to hold back a laugh.<P>  The earth all around began to tremor.  Closer to the gods, the spawn began to turn to see what new terror the gods had brang into being to drive them against the keep.  <P>  "What in gods name..." Commander Gretch whispered. He could see the ground begining to split apart.. no thats not it,  the ground wasnt splitting, the fabric of reality was ripping.<BR>  "Captain!" he shouted "Rouse the battlemages, the real assault begins!!"<P>  One giant hooved leg stepping out of a rift was enough to send the spawn fleeing in every direction.  One giant hooved leg was enough to send the KAAOS gods roaring in evil glee...<P>To be continued....<P>Rann<BR>KAAOS God of the Shadows<BR>
