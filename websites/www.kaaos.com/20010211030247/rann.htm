              <blockquote> 
                <p align="center"><font size="+1" color="#999999">Rebirth: The 
                  making of a GOD</font></p>
                <p align="left"><font color="#999999">The well was part of the 
                  Hell Hole. It, like the fortress, followed the gods to any universe 
                  they sat foot. The contents of this well, was a black liquid 
                  with the consitency of normal water. But there likeness ends. 
                  Each drop of liquid was a soul. A soul harvested by a member 
                  of KAAOS. Its taste was death, its fumes where madness. For 
                  eons, the well had existed. And for eons, the souls had swam 
                  in the waters. Insane and unrecognizable from the person they 
                  once where, they only thought of death. The escape from this 
                  horrible prison. </font></p>
                <p align="left"><font color="#999999">The figure that stood gazing 
                  into the pools depths, need not fear any of the dangers of the 
                  well. He in fact, was an immortal. Just like the rest of those 
                  that inhabit this fortress. Today tho, his reasons for using 
                  the well were different. Today, he had to find another host. 
                  </font></p>
                <p align="left"><font color="#999999">For centuries, he had skipped 
                  from host to host. It started when the mage called forth a great 
                  demon from the abyss. His incantations had been correct, and 
                  his runes had been perfect. When the fiend appeared, it was 
                  bound fully inside the circle of diamond fragments. </font></p>
                <p align="left"><font color="#999999">"WHO IS THE FOOL THAT AWOKE 
                  ME FROM SLUMBER!" the demon questioned commandingly. </font></p>
                <p align="left"><font color="#999999">With a quick gesture and 
                  quickly muttered words, the demon slammed to the ground. Raising 
                  to a crawling postion the fiend growled with anger and scanned 
                  the room for his assailant. </font></p>
                <p align="left"><font color="#999999">"Quiet slayve. It is I who 
                  have summoned thee, and it is I who shall ask the questions." 
                  commanded the bonemage. Altho, answers happend to be the last 
                  thing he sought. </font></p>
                <p align="left"><font color="#999999">The mage began casting spell 
                  upon spell of protection. For an hour this went on the demon 
                  could do nothing but watch. The magic that held him firm prevented 
                  him from doing anything more then speaking. </font></p>
                <p align="left"><font color="#999999">"Why have you summoned me... 
                  master..." The demon spat in contempt when the mage had stopped 
                  his marathon casting. </font></p>
                <p align="left"><font color="#999999">"You see, its quite simple. 
                  I've broken my staff and I need a new one." he stated matter-of-factly. 
                  </font></p>
                <p align="left"><font color="#999999">"You see, its quite simple. 
                  I've broken my staff and I need a new one." he stated matter-of-factly. 
                  </font></p>
                <p align="left"><font color="#999999">"What in the abyss does 
                  that have to do with me?" the demon was more confused then ever. 
                  </font></p>
                <p align="left"><font color="#999999">"Your spine will serve as 
                  a fine replacement." The mage said and began casting another 
                  spell. The force from the blast rocked the tower and the demon 
                  was slammed down once again. Only this time, it was completely 
                  froze. </font></p>
                <p align="left"><font color="#999999">The bonemage strolled thru 
                  the protective circle and placed his hand on the demons back 
                  and the flesh began to melt away. He could smell the charred 
                  flesh in an instant. There. There it was. He grasped the spine 
                  and pulled it free with no more effor then to pull a blade of 
                  grass from the ground. The demon made not a sound. It simply 
                  couldn't. </font></p>
                <p align="left"><font color="#999999">The spine was crooked and 
                  had chunks of flesh hanging from it. Rann straightend the staff 
                  and said a few arcane words and the staff became rigid and glowed 
                  with a faint red light. </font></p>
                <p align="left"><font color="#999999">He walked back out of the 
                  circle and turned to regard the still form of the fiend. </font></p>
                <p align="left"><font color="#999999">"You may return to your 
                  plane now." he said and spoke the words that would break the 
                  summoning and send the demon back to the abyss. That is when 
                  things went wrong. </font></p>
                <p align="left"><font color="#999999">For a split second, the 
                  shield was broken as the gate to the abyss opened. And a second 
                  was all it took. </font></p>
                <p align="left"><font color="#999999">The demon ripped one of 
                  its on claws off and like a bolt of lighting, flung it towards 
                  the mage. It struck just below the heart. Normally this would 
                  not be a fatal wound, but the claw began sinking into the bonemages 
                  flesh. </font></p>
                <p align="left"><font color="#999999">Darkness. Pure nothingness. 
                  </font></p>
                <p align="left"><font color="#999999">He finally regained his 
                  site to see his former body lying on the floor with the bonestaff 
                  in its grasp. Horror filled him. Then turned to hatred. Then, 
                  to instinct. </font></p>
                <p align="left"><font color="#999999">The form rose steadily thru 
                  the tower. Up it went until it found its target. An infant. 
                  No more the 2 days old. He knew what he had to do, and he had 
                  to do it fast. The unlord forced his nothingness into the childs 
                  mind. Once in, he devoured the soul of the newborn. </font></p>
                <p align="left"><font color="#999999">Perhaps if he had known 
                  it was his own son, he may have had an instant of regret. But 
                  he did not care. He would live. And he would grow. </font></p>
                <p align="left"><font color="#999999">Those first days had been 
                  the worst but over time, the process was refined. He could take 
                  a host-child, and will it to grow to adulthood in no more then 
                  a week. If pressed, a day. It took power, but not as much as 
                  to drain him. </font></p>
                <p align="left"><font color="#999999">But like anyliving thing, 
                  decay and extreme age take their toll. A good host would last 
                  perhaps one hundred maybe two hundred years. A weak one, seven 
                  or eight. His current host had lasted a mere two. But the mage 
                  thought that was fine, considering the lengths at which he pushed 
                  the flesh. </font></p>
                <p align="left"><font color="#999999">Already, the flesh had began 
                  to rot. his face was no more then a skull with pieces of putrid 
                  flaps of meat hanging from it. </font></p>
                <p align="left"><font color="#999999">It didn't matter. Tonight 
                  he would find a host. Tonight he would feast. </font></p>
                <p align="left"><font color="#999999">The image of a child appeared 
                  in the well. </font></p>
                <p align="left"><font color="#999999">The mage grinned.</font></p>
                <p align="left"> <font color="#999999">"Tonight, I shall be reborn."
