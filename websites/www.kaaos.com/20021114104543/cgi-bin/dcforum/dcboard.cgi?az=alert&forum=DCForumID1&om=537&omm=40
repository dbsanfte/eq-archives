Ok.  I tried to be nice.  Fuck knows why.  Maybe I was having a "be kind to retards" day.

Look you drooling pile of skin, there is absolutely nothing that your "deep insight" into gaming can reveal to us.  Zip.  Nada.  Not a fucking thing.

Stop capering around here spouting the most transparent crap imaginable as though it's profound insight, Captain Obvious.  No one cares that you found your ass with both hands, and think that qualifies you for the Nobel Prize.

1) Skill will be easy to get in SB
What?  Shut up.

2) Goal will be obtainable with miles and miles of land.
What?  Shut up.

3) Have more people...
Yah?  So what?  Who fucking cares.

4) To have high ethics...
Prove it, tard boy.

5) The idea of a small guild fighting...
Funny.  It's worked out in every other MMORPG to date.  So I guess you're full of shit.

It may or may not work out in SB.  We don't care.

What will happen in SB was predicted by me 2 years ago.  Either small elite guilds will be able kick ass alone, or the small elite guilds will ally together as one big force, and kick the fucking shit out of the big fat sloppy guilds filled with slobbering jack asses who think they have insight.

THEN when the large alliances of small guilds have beaten the crap out of most of the competition, many of those other players will flock to join the cities of the elite guilds.  Why?  Because people like to be on the winning side.  It's the path of least resistance, and it makes some people think they're cool.

You can't neutralize the out-of-the-gate advantage that the power-levelers will have over the sheep.

Now over time, this will even out, and the balance of power will shift...

Why am I fucking explaining this to you.

Let me sum up.  Shut up, freak.
