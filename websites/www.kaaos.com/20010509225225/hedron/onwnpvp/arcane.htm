Fight: WPC Title Fight
Opponent: ITB Arcane<br><br>

Known Opponent Tendencies: First fight with Arcane so unknown. Word of mouth is that he is one of the best text-book fighters.<br><br>

Fight Location Notes: Indoor location, 4 rooms (two on top two on bottom) separated by a single long hallway. There is 1 cloud giant and 6 thieves. Should be minimal NPC involvement if any. Common text book tactic would be to get the giant on opponent, CK the thieves and sil the giant. <br><br>

Fight type: Pre-agreed best of three.<br><br>

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br><br>

First fight:<br><br>

I trig, enter fight, go left and down into the first lower room (pass). Second turn go left again (stay invised, pass).<br><br>

Arcane follows, casts lb (image). Second turn (protects). <br><br>

NPC's now surround Arcane but also block my escape (will not be able to keep invis). Attempting image stripping, first turn fumble (Arcane is slowed, is slowed). Second turn, move down and globe (real).<br><br>

Arcane moves down stands against the corner and LB's me (image), causes (image).<br><br>

I LB rebound Arcane (image, image). Images stripped but no globe read, can't waste another LB on globe check so CL (6 damage). Globe read (fake).<br><br>

NPCs on us now, Arcane dd's out, Arcane moves into upper right room (I'm still in lower left) and images.<br><br>

I move to lower left corner of my room and done delay, one thief moves into perfect location blocking the giant (pass) (pass).<br><br>

We both pass a few rounds, both safe from NPCs. Arcane protects.<br><br>

My globe drops. I image then protect (fake).<br><br>

Arcane moves down into the hall. (Pass) (pass).<br><br>

I move up into hall (lose two images to thief attacks). Need globe read and image stripping, cast MM (unaffected), hold (unaffected).<br><br>

Arcane moves in and causes (damage) causes again (damage).<br><br>

I move out and around, back into the room below and image, protect (fake).<br><br>

Arcane moves away from giant, giant hits (image) then he protects. Second turn he LBs and gets rebound (damage, image).<br><br>

Giant moves down onto him, I move a bit to take his rebound away from where he is standing (to force him to move away from the giant if he wants a shot at a rebound), image. Second turn sil giant (unaffected).<br><br>

Arcane moves away from giant (miss) to get into rebound range. Arcane LBs twice with rebounds (image, image, damage, image).<br><br>

I move around and into top room (down to 18 hps) image (last one) and globe (real).<br><br>

Arcane comes after me. Casts, couple of spells (image) (image).<br><br>

All NPC's all over him, I move down and out of room (pass) (pass).<br><br>

Arcane CK kills all the thieves but doesn't succeed in blocking giant. He was hoping to force giant down after me but giant goes around cloud and onto him.<br><br>

My round count says his globe is down, I move in. He has a possible 0-2 images left, want to strike with fumble to test before LB. Fumble from scroll (is slowed, is slowed). No images struck, thinking none left, LB with rebound (unaffected, unaffected). WTF? <br><br>

He casts image (unaffected) "What the hell? I guess I miscounted too" he says. -rolls eyes-  He uses scroll (protected).<br><br>

Giant on him, I move farther away (pass) (pass).<br><br>

He tries to move from giant with 6 movement, giant strikes twice (image, image). Who knows what the hell is going on at this point with the images and globe. Who cares, that's definitely was 4 images he lost now, none left.<br><br>

I move in, sil giant (unaffected). move away (pass).<br><br>

He dd's from scroll, giant still gets back on him. He moves to me, giant thumps him (damage). <br><br>

I done/delay, giant on him, sil (unaffected). Still would take him 2 moves to get to me, I lost 2 images, hoping I still had another 1 or 2 left. Second turn, sil giant again (unaffected). I start sensing a trend here ;pp<br><br>

He moves towards me, giant thumps him (damage). He's now down to 20 hp's, I'm still at 18. Second turn he moves up to me and causes through whatever images I may have had left (20 damage). Yup, that's the trend I was sensing. <br><br>

Fight Diagnosis:  His images eluded me, the Giant saved sils like they were his long lost lover.  His weakness seems to be with NPC but he's definitely a strong text book fighter. Will stay with same tactic in second fight.<br><br>

~~~~~~~~~~~~<br><br>

Second fight:<br><br>

He trigs. Moves to the spot I moved to and protects.<br><br>

-laugh- <br><br>

I move up into the top room up and stay invised. NPCs all over him before he knows what to do with em.<br><br>

He tries to come after me. Takes him a few rounds to get to me with the NPCs beating on him the whole way. He takes damage several times and loses several images.<br><br>

I pass a few times after I get off the floor laughing. I globe before he reaches my room.<br><br>

He moves into my room and casts fumble (image image), cause (8 damage).<br><br>

NPCs still in the hall, I LB rebound him (damage, damage). Fake globe wheeeeee!!! LB rebound again (damage, damage).<br><br>

He has 2 hp's left. Runs out of room and images, runs again (protects). NPCs all over him once again.<br><br>

I move out of room and cast fumble on him (is slowed, is slowed) and move back into room (pass).<br><br>

He tries to move away from the NPCs they hit (image image) then he stinks a fort. Second turn (pass).<br><br>

He's in the lower left room, I'm in the upper right room. To far for me to get to him so move a bit closer to the upper left room and CK my own fort to protect from the NPCs. <br><br>

We wait, both passing for a few rounds to shift the NPCS around. I move to the other room still above the room he is in, I'm waiting for his globe to go down so I can finish him with a long shot. He picks off a few thieves while we wait. Giant only thing left now, it comes after me, his globe down, I can't get to him with my first turn because I have to walk around the giant. I move, giant thumps me (image). I move into his room and LB with rebound (image, image). Giant back on me now. <br><br>

He uses scroll (protects). Second turn he tries to sil giant (unaffected).<br><br>

I dd into room farther right than him giant gets back on me, I move away from giant (miss). Second turn, CK a fort.<br><br>

Giant goes to him he dd's out.<br><br>

I pass, giant comes towards my cloud.<br><br>

He moves in and passes, he's still too far with his 6 movement to reach me, he moves again tries to dis my cloud but he has to cast off my cloud because his movement wouldn't get him close enough (cloud unaffected).<br><br>

I don't want to take any chances, he has no images left so I go after him, giant misses me, I make it to him and crit his arse, he dead. <br><br>

Fight Diagnosis: I only lost 8 hp's that fight. NPCs definitely get him off balance. Going with the same base tactic for fight 3.<br><br>

~~~~~~~~~~~~<br><br>

Deciding fight:<br><br>

My trig, I prep from scroll like usual and try to trig, fight starts to trig, then doesn't. I lose my prep and I'm out of prep scrolls god dammit (invis included, major disadvantage ;x) I go to re-mem. I stay with the 4 images in grim and go in pre-globed. I trig fight, run right and CK a fort. Second turn done/delay and sil giant (unaffected).<br><br>

He enters, runs left runs down into lower room, stays invis. (pass, pass).<br><br>

NPC's all around my cloud. (pass, pass).<br><br>

He (pass, pass). <br><br>

I done delay until the npc's move up a bit and I can safely get by. I run left and into the big room up top.<br><br>

He globes and is in room to the lower left corner. <br><br>

All the thieves get on me, giant on him trapping him in corner.<br><br>

He casts hold on giant (unaffected). Casts hold on giant again (unaffected).<br><br>

I CK all the thieves, leaving only the giant left alive, I wanted to sil the giant but haste was gone early due to the crap trig and I couldn't get around the corner.<br><br>

He dd's away from the giant then casts on me (image).<br><br>

We move around a bit and end up back in the top room, I keep the giant on him and he takes damage from giant.<br><br>

I eventually move into the room up top to the right of the room we were in, I'm at full health, he's at about 67. I image and wait.<br><br>

He's got the giant on him he has to move away from it 4 times, giant misses all 4 times ;x <br><br>

I wait until I know he can get within range after 2 turns and globe.<br><br>

He finally makes it up into my room, giant is stuck in room to our left, gonna be a slugfest now. He images and globes. <br><br>

I cast fumble on him for images (is slowed, is slowed). I LB with rebound (unaffected, unaffected, no images ;/) he casts a ranged spell on me (image) casts another (image).<br><br>

After 4 chances of hitting an image, I figure he must have gotten shity images. I casts cause serious cause....waiting....no read.....timer ticking down on second turn, can't wait....cause serious again (image from first turn cast reads), (image second cast) doh!!<br><br>

He casts 2 spells (image) (image).<br><br>

I figure he must have just had those 2 images. If he had 3 or 4 when I hit him with a fumble and an lb rebound there's a 90% chance he'd lose at least 1 image (at least this is what I'm thinking ;pp). I cast cause serious.....no read again....waiting...waiting...timer ticking down...can't wait any longer. Cause serious (image first read) (image second cast) doh!! WTF?<br><br>

He casts causes (damage), causes (damage).<br><br>

I'm at 60 he's at 67. I cast CRIT (6 damage), CRIT again (9 damage). Jesus fucking Christ, someone shoved a lucky stick up his ass.<br><br>

He casts cause crit (24 damage), cause crit (22 damage).<br><br>

He's at 52 I'm at 14. I have 2 rounds until my globe is down, and I can't withstand another hit. I run away, he's at 6 movement so he won't be able to follow. Giant gets on me, I pass the next round.<br><br>

He passes and passes.<br><br>

His globe is DOWN. I image and pass, he passes and passes, I done delay giant misses, I move away, giant attacks (miss). Frack, 1 turn ;/. Now is not a good time to slip into single turn mode ;x It's rare, didn't happen in the first two fights either, I'm hoping it passes quickly after a few turns as it often does and reverts back to double turn mode. <br><br>

He passes.<br><br>

Giant on me again, I done delay giant misses I move giant hits (13 damage). I've got 1 hp left, single turn mode hasn't passed ;/ Giant doesn't get to me though. <br><br>

Arcane moves down, can't reach me with his 6 movement so he passes. Single turn mode ends on his turn, back to double turn mode and he gets another turn. I'm not worried though because I'm thinking I should be ok with my images and he's outa lb's and only gets one shot at me. If he hits image, I get to throw 2 LB rebounds on him with his images gone and his globe down. This fight is at the wire, me with 1 hp left playing the image odds and him coming into double LB rebound range with no images or globe. This is it......He casts cause serious, right through the frigin images ;/. I dead.<br><br>

Fight Diagnosis: Awesome fight down to the wire. I wouldn't change tactics next time I faced him. He's too good of a text book fighter to get into a slugfest with. Luck was on his side this time but that balances out over time. I can definatley outmanuever him and that's what I'll try to exploit next I meet him. Also, one odd note. As I said he is a great text book fighter but the second fight he got thrown way out of rhythm when I didn't do the text book moves in the beginning. I believe an unorthodox tactical approach could really throw him out of his game plan. <br><br>

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br><br>

Note: The following week Dethan took the title belt from Arcane and the week after that I took the belt from Dethan. The week after that Arcane won the right to a title match against me. I took what I learned from this log and threw the textbook out. I spent extra time studying the trig and devised tactics that was off the wall and that in combination with force feeding him NPCs kept him off balance. It was a much smoother fight and I retained the belt.
