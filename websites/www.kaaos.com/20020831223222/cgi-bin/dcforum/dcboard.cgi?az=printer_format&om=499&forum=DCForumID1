<blockquote>Hiyas, I was shown this ShaowBane thing by a friend from Ultima Online, I thought it looked really cool. And then I saw that you owned your own city and stuff and I was like, "Awesome!" So I came to your site, killing as a sport eh? I can't wait till I can buy this game, it looks so fun!</blockquote><hr><b><font size=2>Table of contents</font></b><hr>

Ahhh I fondly remember that childhood innocence. The promise of things to come and people to kill. The ever flowing river of blood had not yet begun to flow. Time was still suspended as the noble creatures of ages long past basked the light of goodness. And then the darkness came..................<P><BR>Let the games begin ;p<P><BR>SangDraxx<BR>KAAOS<BR>The Serpent Lord<P><BR>

Sang Dat was weak.  You got a nice side to yourself all of a sudden?  I think you and the newb need a nice room to check into.  Explore your lost innocence.  Then the darkness can come.  Pull your blankie over your heads.....<P>ROFL.<P>DYE<BR>Stop it.  Ya missed me. Its ok.
