         <font size="1" color="#FF0000">LAST EDITED ON Jan-26-01 AT 07:46&nbsp;PM (PST)</font><p>Born in a small poor farmers home a decade before the Turning, was a child.  This child's parents were uneducated poor people with no contact to the outside world aside from the traveling merchants who traded their potatoe's for supplies.<P>The child's name was Potatoe, and he spent his days with his father plowing his namesake.  When he was ten, the world erupted in Chaos;  The sky grew dark, lightning flashed, and everyone felt the presence of the All-Father leave the world.<P>Soon thereafter a band of rough men crested the hill on one glum morning.  Spud and his father were in the field collecting potatoes and usual.  His father looked up, and Spud saw his knuckles turn white on the handle of his hoe.<P>“Get behind me, Spud.”<P>“Yes, Father.”<P>The men advanced, and father asked them their business.  Spud noted their patchy leather armor and the chipped blades of their short swords.<P>“We be but a few hungry men, mister.  Make us a meal.”<P>“What do you have to trade?” asked father.<P>“We can trade you your life, if ye want.”<P>“Come with me”<P>As father turned toward the small cabin, the men grew surly grins and followed close.  Spud watched his father turn his hoe, so that it faced up rather than down, and shift one hand down the shaft.<P>In a blur of motion his father pivoted on one foot, and Spud’s eyes grew wide as the sharp edge of the hoe sank into the side of the mercenary leaders skull.  But father was no fighting man.  He tugged, but the hoe would not dislodge.  This was the first dead man Spud had ever seen.  It was a curious sight.<P>The mercenaries were surprised, but the nearest one jumped on his father and brought him to the ground.  The rest drew their swords, and soon his father’s blood moistened the ground.<P>One of the mercenaries grabbed Spud roughly and tossed him over his shoulder; and they all marched towards Spud’s home.  Spud didn’t know what to make of this, he kept silent and shed no tear.<P>Spuds mother was in the kitchen, there were no windows facing the field and she was unaware of what had occurred.  The mercenaries burst through the door, one grabbed her and ripped her clothes off.<P>“haha, an unexpected pleasure.  This bitch you’re mother, kid?”<P>Spud said nothing, just watched.<P>“You deaf little boy?  Aren’t you going to say anything?  I’m going to rape your mother.”<P>Spud didn’t know what rape meant.  But he soon learned.  His mother screamed and cried, then whimpered, then just laid there with eyes glazed, as each man laughed and had his way with her.<P>“What should we do with her now?” asked one of the men.<P>“Just leave her she’s worthless.  Let’s take the kid though, he looks to have some muscle.”<P>The men feasted on his parents potatoes, then bid their laughing farewell to his incapacitated mother.<P>The men set up camp that night around a campfire, and began laughing about the days exploits.  Their dead leader already forgotten, a new tough had taken over.<P>“What’s your name, kid?”  one of them asked.  Up until now, Spud had not said a word.  Just watched and listened, and most of all thought.  These men had power, and they were evil.  His parents had no power, and they were good.  His young mind thought about this again and again. <P>He had never seen someone die, and he respected his dead father.  He had put a fucking hoe in someone’s head.  Fucking was a new word to him, he had heard one of the mercenaries say it.<P>His mother had cried and screamed.  People had laughed at her.  He decided to be like his father.  Kill people.  Have Power.  But he wouldn’t be using a hoe.  And he wouldn’t be gathering potatoes.<P>Spud came out of his introspection as one of the mercenaries smacked him across the face.<P>“I asked you a question, you little pissant.  What’s your name?”<P>“Spud”  Spud said simply.<P>“What the fuck?  Were your parents stupid?”<BR>“What?” asked Spud.  He was confused.<P>“That’s the stupidest pussy name I’ve ever heard you little shit.  You are BloodLicker from now on.”<P>Spud thought this new name was stupid.  Why would he forsake his birthname?  It made no sense.<P>That night the mercenaries fell asleep after guzzling all the vodka his father had distilled from the potatoes.  They forgot about little 10 year old ‘BloodLicker’.<P>The embers in the fire still glowed and spud could see the outline of the passed out mercenaries.  He saw a dagger sticking out of the belt of the nearest one.<P>He hopped up and took the dagger out of the belt.  Not bothering to be silent.  He knew these men wouldn’t wake up, just like his father never woke up when he drank the vodka.<P>Power.  His dad had killed a man, but he wasn’t powerful enough to kill them all.  Spud would kill them all for him.  His father had showed him what it took to make it in this world.  He forgot about his mother.  She had just cried.<P>One by one Spud went around the circle and cut jabbed the knife straight down into the chest of each man as hard as he could.  He was ten, and on his first try he tried to hit the man in the chest with the point of the dagger, and it ricocheted off his rib.  The man jerked and Spud hurriedly put the knife against his chest and slid it between his ribs.  A little blood burbled from between his lips.<P>He came upon the man who had called him BloodLicker.  His father had called him Spud.  His Father had killed this mans leader.  He wasn’t BloodLicker.  All the other men he killed, but he saved this one man for last.<P>This man he had watched drink more than the others.  Spud was relatively sure he would not awaken.  But to make sure, he removed the mans weapons and threw them in the bushes.  Spud cut off all his fingers.  Then he noticed with concern that they were bleeding very much.  He did not want this man to die.  Once he had seen his father stick a hot coal against a cut on his arm, and the wound had stopped bleeding.  He did that.  Spud Cauterized the stumps of this mans fingers closed.  The man grunted in his stupor, but didn’t awaken.<P>Spud took off the mans shirt.  He was going to do this where the man would see.  <P>Spud had never learned to write much.  His mother had taught him a little, but his mother was stupid.   She had cried.<P>Spud used the dagger like a pen, and wrote “my name Spud” across the mans chest.  Then cut off his left ear for good measure.  Power.  Spud would have power over others.<BR>
