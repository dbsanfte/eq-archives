         Answer #1<BR>Do you mean the recomendations for what books to read?  Opra's book of the week club?  No.  I've either read them or have differing opinions on what a good book is.  I'm not checking out news sites 20 times a day to find out what some ex-marine who works in pre-customer support for a pre-profit pre-release pre-execute-the-business-plan company has to say about literature.    <P>Personally I'm looking for real data on what SB will be like and don't get real excited when they say "Beta is almost here... in the mean time, go read 12 books!"  Its even LESS interesting than "Dwarves have a lot of strengh"... so what do 12 points of strength actually MEAN in the friggin GAME, Numbnuts?? (answer: We can't tell you or our competitors will rip off the idea.)<P>Answer #2<BR>Do you mean the Lore stuff they are propping up in lue of real information about the game?  Not reading much, no.  Once again, I'm looking for information on the game itself... not "Erolsi Marr and Guard Lucan used to date but Cazic Thul got upset and called The Tribuneral and made a fancy sword that only Lord British can jam up a ShadowLords ass..." (insert gods and Feature Characters as you prefer) <P>I mean, really.  Telling me that Minotaurs hate Elves doesn't mean squat if there are no factions or implications attached, so WTF do I care if the pro-genitor of Minotaurs had a fancy axe that a Dorf stole and melted down to make iron panties for his Aunt Jenny?  Are there any factions or real implications to dwarves hating Minotaurs or whatever?  if so... then I'm inerested.  It's just a time sink.  When the GAME comes out and IF it is playable THEN I'll dig into the backstory to the extent I need to.  The rest is just fluff designed for people who get off on Roleplaying Orcs... oh... Orcs that Play to Crush, right?  Look at the resume of this Meridian guy... he "always wanted to be a writer" (!)  That's Great Skippy!  I always wanted to be Porn Star but that doesn't mean I have a twelve inch Johnson!  If you want someone to create fiction for you... read any schmucks RP posts or have a beer with Ego and listen to him tell you about his Johnson! <P>By the way... has Arcane ever actually run a company before?  Has "Marketing Wizard" Todd Coleman ever actually been a Marketing Wizard anywhere but in Marketing 462 "Selling the Obvious".  What about Ashen Temper who learned everything there is to know about Customer Support while humping sand bags in the Marines?<P>Personally, I have yet to see anything but Theory and Concept out of these guys and we've all been lead down the primrose path on every single pre-beta game there ever was.  Think of what you EXPECTED Ultima Online to be 2 months before the Beta.  Think of what you EXPECTED EverQuest to be 2 months before the beta.  So do you really expect people who have played online games for over 10 years and put up with all the Bugs, Exploits, and Shitty Customer Service to simply bend over and suck the hype straight up their butts?  <P>Its fucking rediculous how many saps are oo-ing and awe-ing about every stupid word that rolls out of Wolfpacks happy goddam funball machine.<P>"Shadowbane is going to be our savior because they have uh... they have PvP and Guild vrs Guild stuff and..."<P>"Skippy, how does the PvP work?"<P>"Well you can build an Empire which is really cool and..."<P>"Skippy, is it better to have 500 members at level 3, or 3 members at level 500?"<P>"Well, we cant tell you that but the game is just gonna be peachy and Play to Crush, Dude!"<P>"Skippy, what about all this shit regarding different worlds having different physics with regards to Magic (etc) but then they say we can eventually world-hop to build an empire... could you explain what the fuck they are talking about?"<P>"Here, read this cliche storyline about knights in shining armor and villians who ruined the world and while your at it... the Tech Support guy loves these 15 books... maybe you should read them so you'll know how to play to crush" <P>"Skippy, you're giving me a headache"<P>~f<P>~f<P>~f <BR>
