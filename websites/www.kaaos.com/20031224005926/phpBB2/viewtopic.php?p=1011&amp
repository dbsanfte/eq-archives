				<td colspan="2"><span class="postbody">Information about Maxes. If your not interested in doing the whole read, here's the 411.
<br />

<br />
TR has the best indoor maxes. Nothing matches the Pounder for Infantry splattering. Inside the Dual Cycler is incredibly accurate and deadly, but we're talking inside of 10 meters for this to be the case. The Sparrow max is an insanely good AI and AV max, followed by the Falcon and the Vanu AV max.
<br />

<br />
----------------------------------------
<br />
Ok, First of all, sorry for the caps in the title. We have now I think 3 threads that where utilizing my previous test results and I figured it would be a pain to read through them all.
<br />
Ok, we all know by now that the Starfire has a maximum range of 270 meters versus the TR AA Max at 250 meters and the NC Sparrow at 450 meters. We also know that there is a severe damage degratation, basicly the sparrow can kill a reaver with 7 rounds, ( i stated in earlier test 6, but wife counted wrong so had to revise it) while a Starfire can kill with 7 round only up to range 120. At range 270 it takes 64 rounds. But this is being looked at allready.
<br />
The major problem that we saw was that the maximum range and the projectile speed is so dramaticly different from starfire to sparrow. Now Spock kept insisting by checking facts and performing his own test that the speed on both maxes projectiles is the same.
<br />

<br />
I thought about the best way to truly test this now, and figure the best test is performed by comparing the time to target at a common maxium range. This would be 270 meters.
<br />

<br />
Situations is such.
<br />

<br />
Poor Wife is hovering at 270 meters in VS Reaver while I am in NC Sparrow cackling.
<br />

<br />
Using a brand spanking new digital stop watch pushed at time of fire and again at time of impact on reaver. Only could get total 7 samples as after 7 hits the reaver decided to blow up.
<br />

<br />
270 meters sparrow - fire to hit time
<br />
4.25
<br />
4.12
<br />
4.18
<br />
4.17
<br />
4.20
<br />
4.12
<br />
4.17
<br />

<br />
Average time to hit target 270 meters away = 4.17 seconds
<br />

<br />
That is a speed of 64.74 meters per second, or 233 kph.
<br />

<br />
Now same test, this time i am in reaver hovering, wife is in starfire at range 270.
<br />

<br />
270 meters Starfire- fire to hit time
<br />
6.27
<br />
6.34
<br />
6.27
<br />
6.18
<br />
6.21
<br />
6.17
<br />
6.25
<br />

<br />
Average time to hit target 270 meters away = 6.24 seconds,
<br />

<br />
That is a speed of 43.26 meters per second, or 155 kph.
<br />

<br />
Now for for kicks I wanted to compare my longest possible fire range with the speed of the round on the sparrow. That is the flightime for a sparrow missle at 450 meters. This freaked me out.
<br />

<br />
Test, sparrow and reaver 450 meters appart, time from fire to impact.
<br />

<br />
Average time was 6 seconds exactly. now this would indicate a 75 meters per second speed or average speed of 270 kph.
<br />

<br />
I was stomped, the test indicated the missle was faster the further out it whent. Ok, poor wife, we have to do both test now at half the original test range. 135.
<br />

<br />
Test results 135 meters - time from fire to impact
<br />

<br />
Starfire 3.2 seconds or 42.18 meters per second or 151 kph.
<br />
Sparrow 2.4 seconds or 56.25 meters per second or 202 kph.
<br />

<br />
This shown me a very odd fact. The starfire seems to launch and maintain speed at an average of 151 kph.
<br />
The sparrow seems accelerate during flight, I am not sure about the launch speed, but could imagine it to be around 151 kph, but by range 135 its AVERAGE speed is now at 202 kph, by range 270 it has an AVERAGE speed of 233 and by range 450 it has an average speed of 270 kph. I suspect that the actual speed at 450 meters is about 300 kph. This would explain also why people have problems afterburning away from sparrows, just when they are starting to slow down from the afterburner, the missle itself kicks into overdrive.
<br />

<br />
Model - Range/Speed - Range/Speed - Range/Speed
<br />
Starfire - 135m/151kph - 270m/151kph - 450m/0kph
<br />
Sparrow - 135m/202kph - 270m/233kph - 450m/270kph
<br />

<br />
These are average speeds, top speed is a bit higher since the Sparrow missle started most likley at speed 151 kph just as the Starfire.
<br />

<br />
Basicly the closer you will be the less the speed differents will be noticed, the further you engage the more time the sparrow missles has to increase speed and the higher the timed differeses seem to be.
<br />

<br />

<br />
Anyway, I must correct my earlier reports, the Sparrow requires 7 not 6 missles to kill a reaver at range 450 meters that is hovering. To compare the damage it takes at range 125 8 rounds to kill a reaver, at range 135 it takes 9 with the Starfire. This is with the current life max, not with the testserver max.
<br />

<br />
Spock, Please Please Please Please, perform this test similar to as what I did here. Ensure you have a good stopwatch and peform them at these 3 ranges. If your results differ from mine, then the only reason can be that there is a differents with LAN connection and Internet Connection. But I suspect you will come up with the same results.
<br />

<br />

<br />
-----------------------------------
<br />
Adding my AV Max evaluation tests here, but be aware that they have their own thread going.
<br />
Ok, since several of you asked me to dublicate my test peformed on the AA MAxes to the AV maxes, here are the results. 
<br />
On a side note, I have not tested the AV TR maxes as I truly cant figure out what actuly is a AV max and what is a AI max for them. Seems both of them seem to be so dual purpose that either of them could be mistaken for eather role.
<br />
Anyway, my wife Tipped was again my main test subject. Damages where against each others maxes.
<br />

<br />
Maximum Range for the Coment is 200 meters, for the Falcon I was unable to determind it since it seemed to fire past any visual horizont I did have. I suspect it to be in the 400 to 500 meter range, but cant be sure. I can say that both seem to have the same cof and any shots past 200 meters would most likley never hit anything anyway.
<br />

<br />
First Projectile Speed. This was a bit harder, since the maximum range on the VS max was 200 and the shorter the range the more chance for error is possible because of human reflexes on the stop watch. Each range test was performed with about 20 rounds, each being timed and then the average taken.
<br />

<br />
Falcon 3.4 seconds flight time for 200 meters
<br />
Comet 4.4 seconds flight time for 200 meters
<br />
Falcon = 58.82 meter per second or 211 kph
<br />
Comet = 45.45 meter per second or 163 kph
<br />
margins of about 10% up or down are to be expected with the relative short flight times on this test.
<br />

<br />
Direct Damage Results versus Max Target
<br />

<br />
Falcon does at all ranges 50 points to Max
<br />
Comet does at point blank range 100 with full burn, and degrades linear to 50 points at range 200. This was very interesting, the comet actuly will outdamge or equal the damage of the falcon at all ranges up to 200 meters, then the falcon will gain a edge, since the Comet cant fire back.
<br />

<br />
Another factor that was tested is the loss of damage duo to the burn.
<br />

<br />
When Tipped (wife) fire one shot at point blank at me, it did 100 points with the burn every time. When she fired 2 round fast at me, the damage in the end was 180. Since we know that the 2nd round did 100, we also can determind that at full rate of fire any previous round will lose exactly 20% of its damage because the burn does not stack. The Comet has a clip of 10 rounds, so whenever it unloads the clip onto an enemie it will do at point blank range only 80 x 9 plus 100 = 820 points of damage. So basicly this gives us a Value of exactly 82% of max damage when firing a full clip at full rate of fire. Even with this reduction the Comet will have better or equal damage against the Falcon at ranges up to 165 meters or so.
<br />

<br />
Another intersing fact was the burst area.
<br />

<br />
Falcon Radius/Damage
<br />
3 meter = 21
<br />
2 meter = 39
<br />
1.9 meter = 0 (note that when standing butted up against another max, there is no splash to you for some reason)
<br />

<br />
Comet
<br />
4.5 meter = 12
<br />
3.5 meter = 20
<br />
2.5 meter = 31
<br />
1.9 meter = 0 Again when butted up against another max you did not receive any splash damage
<br />

<br />
So in splash damage the Comet has roughly a 1 to 1.5 meter larger radius, 4.5 versus 3 meters. The damage for the splash was about the same.
<br />

<br />
Falcon has a 20 round clip and needs 10 secs to empty it.
<br />
Comet has a 10 round clip and needs 5 secs to empty it.
<br />

<br />
So both maxes have exactly the same rate of fire, but the Falcon has twice the magazine.
<br />

<br />
For those that do not know how the shield works on NC maxes. Once turned on it will slowly degrade your powerpoints. It will also protect the max against 2 damage points for each powerpoint. This means that if you turned it on and got hit right away you would basicly be able to absorbe about 200 points. Now this does not work out in practice like that, since you will turn it on on the way in and several seconds may pass before you get hit. I would say on average the NC max gets to use about 50 to 75% of its shield power at any one time, so he basicly could block about 100 to 150 points of damage.
<br />

<br />
Anway, to sum it all up.
<br />

<br />
The projectile speed is a little better on the Falcon, but both maxes are having a very hard time hitting moving vehicles with it. I suspect that both should have the projectile speed incrased to maybe 250 kph or so. The damage output defenitly goes to the comet, even at its maximum range where only every 3rd shot will hit the max does equal damage, and will do double the damage at point blank range. Tho when looking at the damage, it does appear a bit wimpy for AV maxes overall. The burst radius is slighly in favor of the Comet, but since the Falcon can shoot at longer ranges then the Comet it is probl somewhat balanced. Both have the same rate of fire, but the Falcon has double the clip.
<br />

<br />
I would say overall the Comet is more usefull in this case. Both maxes cant really kill vehicles very well, they dont have projectiles that are accurate or fast enough, and both of them would have to fire many clips into a tank to kill it. The CoF or the AV maxes needs to be reduced, the speed of the projectiles increased, and the Falcon needs to be brought up to the damage potential of the Comet or at least to 70% of it since in practical use the comet will always do 82% of its potential damage only.
<br />

<br />
I think possibly checking the shield, and making it so that turning it on does not drain it, only actual damage drains it and maybe increasing the absorbtion to 2.5 or 3 points per energie point.
<br />

<br />
Anyway, the differents is not as dramatic as betwhen the Sparrow and Starfire, but substantial enough to most defenitly look at the Falcon for damage upgrade and for both on a projectile speed upgrade.
<br />

<br />
Hope this clears a bit of the confusion away for the NC and VS AV maxes. Sorry to the tr guys again, once somebody figures out what primary roles your maxes actuly play, then I can do the test on them.
<br />

<br />

-------------------------------------------
<br />
Coping my Dual Cycler post in here also, its not a aa max, but still interesting to see the results.
<br />
Ok, here are the TR Dual Cycler Numbers. 
<br />
Test where performed wihout lockdown, as lockdown is a special ability that should balance against jump and shield.
<br />

<br />
Rate of fire = 200 rounds in 35 seconds or 5.71 rounds per second.
<br />

<br />
Maximum Range is same as Comet, 200 meters.
<br />

<br />
Cof is similar total crap at ranges 100 plus, and on top of it, the cof expands so maximum rof cannot be achived as the accuracy will become non effective.
<br />

<br />
Projectile speed, now these babys move. I would say that its about 0.7 seconds for 200. its more then 0.5 but less then 1 second. this would put the rounds at about 285 meter per second or 1028 kph. Pretty much instand.
<br />

<br />
Now comes the kicker.
<br />

<br />
This is full infantry damage, pleas be aware that each infantry suit will now split damage for armor and health. 
<br />

<br />
Standard - 4 armor rest health
<br />
agile - 6 armor rest health
<br />
Reinforced - 8 armor rest health.
<br />

<br />
Now lets put some pratical numbers on this. We know that a Comet and Falcon can kill each other at range 50 without using their abilities at about 8 seconds, assuming each shot hits.
<br />

<br />
Now we know that the cycler does 14 points of damage at range 50. We also know that the rate of fire is 5.71.
<br />

<br />
Ok, 750 / 14 = 54 shots needed to kill
<br />
54 / 5.71 = 9.45 seconds. Now I did try this in practice, and found that the cof expanded to much at 50 meters to put each bullet on the target, so lets say you have to add at least 2 0.5 second pauses in order to stop the cof from expanding to much. This puts the kill time at about 10.5 seconds at 50 meters versus the aproximate 8 seconds it took the Falcon and the Comet. Now add to this the fact that even a close hit from the Falcon and the Comet will give you some damage and you could say without any problem the MAX is defenitly sub par to the other 2 AV maxes.
<br />

<br />
Now another big problem I saw when evaluating this max. It took me around 5 to 8 trieds firing single shots to hit a max at range 199 meter. If I actuly had opend up or locked down and opened up my cof would have been so large that the odds of hitting a max at that range would be probl one out of 20 rounds. Very bad design.
<br />

<br />
I was also under the impression that LockDown would double the rate of fire, this was a wrong asumption.
<br />

<br />
No Lock = 200 rounds in 35 seconds = 5.71 rps
<br />
LockDown = 200 rounds in 22 seconds = 9.09 rps
<br />
This is only a 59% increase of the rate of fire rather then the assumed 100%. But even if it was 100, it would only mean the max would be wasting 39% more ammunition in the same given time.
<br />

<br />
Killing a standing still Infantry guy at range 200 would require 250 hits, combine that with the hit ratio of about 1 in 10 or higher and you would have to fire about 2500 rounds at range 200 to kill a infantry guy, that is in non lock mode 7.2 minutes. Trying to kill a Max at range 200 in Non Locked mode requires 750 rounds, again lets be optimistic and say its a 1 out of 5 round hit scenerio, and you have a required rounds of 3750. This would require the max 11 minutes to kill another max at range 200. Ok, now these numbers can be influenced by the random factor and can be improved by adding more burst pauses to increase the hit ratio, but overall this max is most definetly the biggest loser in the AV max lineup.
<br />

<br />
The best scenario for this max at point blank range is 7.29 seconds to kill a max in non lock down mode and 4.58 in lock down mode. But again, I personaly dont feel the special functions of the faction maxes should be considered here. The special functions in general need to be balanced against themself.
<br />

<br />
So knowing this fact the maxes rate about like this.
<br />

<br />
Extreme Close Range the winner is the Cycler, but only since he does not hurt himself with burst.
<br />
Close Range 10 to 40 or so the comet will get my vote.
<br />
medium, long and extreeme long will go to the Falcon, as it has no damage degration and can also fire at beyond the visual horizon with its rockets where the other two are limtied to 200 meters.
<br />

<br />
Overall I would say the Falcon is probl the most usefull of the 3 only because it can act as a standoff weapon out of range of striker, phonix and lancer and provide support and suppression fire, but that is not saying much, in my humble opinion all 3 AV maxes are an absolute joke for what they are designed to do.
<br />

<br />
Oh, and some advice to the TR guys, dont bother to fire that Dual Cycler unless you are at 100 meters or less, and even then givin your position away for the damage given is most likley not worth it. The max is probl only good for pin point lockdown on entrances within 50 meter range and as a substituted at extreme close ranges since you do not take burst damge from your own shots.
<br />
-----------------------------------------
<br />
Posted this in the AV max section, but since suprisingly the Sparrow is actuly the winner of the AV max results, had to post it here also.
<br />
Ok, here are the results of the VS and NC AV maxes against infantry and AMS.
<br />
Fact one, It takes exactly 60 rounds at any range from a Falcon to kill a AMS, that is 60 x 50 = 3000 hit points.
<br />

<br />
Fact two, it takes exactly 60 ronds at any range from a Sparrow to kill a AMS, that is 60 x 50 = 3000 hit points.
<br />

<br />
Fact three, it takes exactly 30 slow fire rounds at range 6 meters from a Comet to kill a AMS, that is 30 x 100 = 3000 hit points.
<br />

<br />
Fact four, it takes exactly 47 fast fire rounds at range 6 meters from a comet to kill a ams, that is 17 rounds overall lost because of the damage loss of the burn or a little over two clips.
<br />

<br />
Fact five, i tried to kill a ams in a tr cycler max at range 200, but I ran out of ammo and the damn thing was still at half health.
<br />

<br />
Fact six, at range 6 it took the commet 32 seconds to kill the ams in fast fire mode, including the reloads. The Sparrow and the Falcon can perform the same 32 second kill reliably up to range 100, then a few extra rounds for misses must be added.
<br />

<br />
Ok, here is the most interesting part.
<br />

<br />
Max damage versus infantry, very odd numbers.
<br />

<br />
Sparrow/Falcon all ranges
<br />
Standard 15 Armor-10 Health = total 35 damage
<br />
Agile 25 Armor-10 Health = total 35 damage
<br />
Reinforeced 35 Armor - 0 Health = total of 35 damage.
<br />

<br />
Ok, to sum it up on that, a direct hit, and any hit within 2.5 meters will do 35 damage against infantry. The odd part was that the splash was up exept for exactly at 3 meters the same damage as a direct hit.
<br />

<br />
Comet at range 2 against Infantry
<br />
Stand 31 Armor - 9 Health = 40 Damage
<br />
Agil 35 Armor - 5 Health = 40 Damage
<br />
Reinf 38 Armor - 2 Health = 40 Damage 
<br />
At this range of course the Comet takes damage himself.
<br />

<br />
Comet at range 100 against infantry
<br />
Reinf 31 Armor - 0 Health = 31 Damage 
<br />

<br />
Comet at range 200 against infantry
<br />
Reinf 19 Armor - 0 Health = 19 Damage
<br />

<br />
Splash degration on the Comet was substantial, at range 6 meters firing besides the target at about 2.5 meters leads to 6 health 8 armor = 14 damage where the Sparrow/Falcon still achived 35 damage against a reinforced = 35 total damage.
<br />

<br />
Ok, This puts a whole new spectrum on this maxes.
<br />

<br />
In their primary role I belive the Falcon to be the better overall max since of its longer range capability without damage droppoff. The TR Max was not really close unless he is close. Now if you add in the infantry capability, you will see that the Falcon can effetively be used for suppression at all ranges, giving any target hits within 2.5 meters of the grunts a 35 total damage hit. The Comet can supresse effective at close and medium range, but close and longer range hits degrade to fast to be effetive. The TR max again is only good at close range, since at long range his projectile damage is so low, when combined with the poor hit performance and he finishes last.
<br />

<br />
AV MAX Roundoup.
<br />

<br />
Falcon = Best at 50 meter to 450 meter, no question.
<br />
Comet = Pretty good and probl best at 10 to 40 meters
<br />
Cycler = Ok at up to 50 meters, best used at under 5 if used against enemie maxes, this way you force them to splash themself.
<br />

<br />
Now I will add the final winner for the best AV MAX
<br />

<br />
SPARROW - Hmm, you will say, huh, why the sparrow, its not a av max. my reply is.
<br />

<br />
Sparrow and Falcon share the same warhead. Both do identical damage to grunts, vehicles and maxes. Both have projectiles that will go past 450 meters. both have similar or same rate of fire. Sparrow has faster projectile, it will start at around 151 and end up close to 300 kph during a flight reaching 450 meters. Sparrow has a smaller clip, but it is of course also the best rated AA max.
<br />

<br />
So suprisingly as it may seem, the Sparrow matches or surpases the Sparrow in its Anti Armor and Anti Vehicle role in every aspect exept for total rounds in clip. It also by far is the most succesfull AA max. It also cost 1 point less to cert in.
<br />

<br />
This means that a 2 point cert AA max can fill the roll of a 3 point cert AV max better and on top of it is in many situations a better AI max then the others (range supression)
<br />

<br />
Wow, In actuality I did not expect to find this results as I started out on this test quest when Spock stated that the Starfire has the same projectile speed as the Sparrow.
<br />

<br />
If I was NC, I would make speccing in a Sparrow for AA, AV and AI reasons a must. Also since the Sparrow if used by a few qualified personal, can effectively supress any enemie air power, I would recomend heavy speccing in Reaver and Libs. This of course will guarantie gound superiority, and will allow heavier speccing in Vanguards and other vehicles, allowing the NC to bypass one of VS's most potend weapons, the magmower. Once a base is supressed by air and ground vehicle superiority, its only a matter of time for the NTU to run out and then even the dreaded Lasher can be totaly avoided.
<br />

<br />
Anyway, I still dont think this should raise a call for nerfing the Sparrow. Since none of the AV maxes are performing their AV duty well, I think they should of course look at the balance in the AA MAX department by bringing the TR and VS max up to par, but they should look at all 3 factions maxes in the AV category to bring them up to snuff against armor and other maxes.
<br />

<br />
Ok, hope to take a break now and actuly play a bit. Oh, and if you see me on Konrid in my VS Starfire MAX, dont lob a Striker or Phonix at me right away, allow me to at least fill the sky with the traditional VS firework display.
<br />

<br />
----------------------------------
<br />
Ok, little addition, I figured I spend a little combat time in a Sparrow, to refresh my sense of its actual effectiveness.
<br />
First thing I noticed, seems there is allot less aircraft targets when playing NC. So I defaulted to my secondary role, infantry supression. During several tower fights I located a spot where I could hide behind a rock and lob shells into the top door. Everytime i got missle lock (TR) I would be able to hit my shield and back behind the rock. Overall I actuly ran out of ammo and ended up doing a suiced run. The base was next, and thank good, several TR players did take up reavers. I noted that the lockon stays often green when you have a enemie in sight, often taking 1 or 2 seconds to turn red. I suspect this is either a bug or some wird atempt to balance it. Anyway, if you do have problems locking on, i found zooming seems to increase your chance. For those that I did lock on 7 missles fired did the trick on reavers every time. I ended up in about a 5 minute time spawn with 3 reaver, 1 lib and 2 moscs. One Reaver finaly took me down, by actuly ramming me as I fired my missles at him.
<br />

<br />
Overall I found the MAX in its AA role to be very satisfying. Planes at ranges of 200 and more could be effectively engaged and damaged or dstroyed. Libs flying at ceiling level (terrain was a bit higher also) where no problem to damage, tho most of them did retreat out of range once locked on.
<br />

<br />
With a bit of fire control leading running infantry is well possible and allot of fun. Engaging Tower TR maxes (cycler) at 202 meters was very enjoyable, he locked down, and let it rip, I slowly blasted him into scrap. Every one of his bullest fizzed out at 1 meter in front of me. Yes, you still die in this max, all maxes are not really that tough, but once you relize the limitations the other factions maxes have, you can very effectively engage them without fearing any meaningfull retaliation.
<br />

<br />
I would suggest that provoding suppression fire at range 200 or 250 should protect you from 95% of the enemeis retaliation capability. The Sparrow and the Falcon have range when it comes to ground combat, use that range. Oh, if you do want to stop the TR max form unlocking and giving up, move to range 199, he will do 1 point of damage to you and get his target bloom, but you will do 50 damage each round that hits direct and a bit less for rounds that splash.
<br />

<br />
Anyway, it was allot of fun to play that max, after playing the Starfire and comet for so long. It was depressing partialy, since as we all know Spock seems to have problems performing similar test and providing a more fair and balanced system, but ok. Anyway, back to my Starfire, tho I will have to assume that after playing the Sparrow for a few hours, the Starfire will loss its appeal for me quickly.<br />_________________<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Tyo</span>
