         <blockquote>
         3/10/2000<P>Darkness crashed.<P>It must have been the darkness crashing, because there was nothing else to crash.<P>Darkness doesn't crash.<P>This darkness crashed.<P>The air was cold.  It had that bite that invigorates the skin, and yet is not enough to go beneath.  The clean draw of cold in through the nose that wakes up the lungs.  The hard edged feel of cold that makes even vision sharpen.<P>And the darkness crashed.  It crashed like ocean waves before a hurricane - continuous, enfolding, unhesitating, powerful, inescapable.  One long crash that was like falling forward and never hitting the ground - but expecting to... waiting to... wanting to...<P>It was a rhythm that swept the hammering of your heart along like a partner in a wild and throbbing dance.<P>The moon was clear, hard and bright - like the cold in the air.  Its light invaded the snow among the trees, cutting through the leafless branches and falling hard upon the ground.  It enriched the world with high-lights, and complicated the darkness by cutting it into pieces that vibrated in place, want to join together into a complete blanket of lightlessness.<P>It was most definitely the darkness that crashed.  Only the darkness could crash so quietly loud.  Only the darkness could be the swelling of mayhem and corruption and chaos and yet be nothing at the same time.<P>Hedron stood stock still and inhaled it all into himself on the backs of the shreds of cold air that he pulled in.  As the darkness vibrated, so did he.  Or perhaps as he vibrated, so did the darkness.  It was hard to tell which one was the aggressor.<P>Hedron did not move.  His tendons and bones lay locked in a stone-like immobility.  His jaw was clenched in a rock-like solidity.<P>This tableau of crashing darkness, biting cold, and hard edged moonlight was like a painting brushed down around The False Prophet.  Or at least that was how he felt.  And he was unsure whether he should move.  He knew that if he moved this crystalline image around him would break.  He did not want it to break.  He felt it closing in around him, denying him the ability to move.  He felt it close around his arms, his legs, his throat, his belly... and now he knew that it was closing in around his eyes.  And yet still he would not move.  This... "painting" made him feel alive on the surface, even as it closed around him tighter and tighter.  And he felt a devotion to it.  A devotion that would not allow him to break it.<P>Each time it drew tighter, though, another piece of the darkness would come into contact with him.  And as soon as it did, it would begin to crash.  Hedron held himself as still as he could.  Not still enough, not still enough, not still enough.  He vibrated with the inner energy that threatened to smash everything around him.  And as the painting tried to still that vibration, it instead began to shake and shiver with it.<P>Time was all it took.  Time brought the darkness to vibrate.  And vibration brought the darkness to crash.  And crashing brought the snow and the ice and the trees and the cold and the moonlight and the air... brought all of it to destruction.<P>The darkness crashed, and with it crashed the world.  And in the end all that stood was The False Prophet.  Jaw still clenched, muscles still frozen, with every fiber of his being still vibrating with that tremor that destroyed everything around him.<P>He wanted to weep for the loss, but he could not.  He wanted to devastate the darkness for crashing, but he could not.  He wanted to deny the painting had existed.  He knew he could do that.  But he would not.<P>Slowly, he moved.  His body drifted forward in a place with no direction.  His jaw loosened.  After a time his mind released its tension, swept out and embraced the darkness as his own.<P>Once again he knew what he had always known.  Nothing nothing nothing lasts.  Except himself and his memory of the things he had destroyed.<P>Somewhere in the darkness crouched the figure of a woman.  She had fallen into shards of crystal when everything else had.  But unlike the rest, for her, in the darkness an afterimage glowed and persisted.  When Hedron closed his eyes, he saw her.  Each time he closed his eyes, her image was dimmer than the last time.<P>He lifted the twisted cross, closed his eyes, and slashed its filthy metal through the image of the woman, tearing it like paper.  The torn edges of her soul fluttered in the darkness until she was absorbed into the twisted cross wholly and completely.<P>His eyes opened, and for a moment he stood there blinking.  In the nothingness, he planted the twisted cross like a headstone into the space before him.  Slowly he walked away.  When the soul of the woman had bled from the cross and into the soil of darkness, he would return for it.  Until then it would stay here.  And he would not.<P>The darkness crashed as he walked away.<P><BR>Hedron<BR><a href="http://www.kaaos.com/hedron/falseprophet.htm" target="_blank">The False Prophet</a><BR><a href="http://www.kaaos.com" target="_blank">KAAOS</a><P>...No child, don't cry.  Your tears only boil away on the Twisted Cross.  It's your blood that soaks in deep.  Your blood...<P><a href="http://www.kaaos.com/hedron/6circles.htm" target="_blank">The 6 Circles</a><BR>

It was merely a question of what unfortunate soul would awaken the fire again.<P>Until then, his drink burned more than his eyes, and his soul slept.<P>Dreaming and death are so similar.

He absorbed the pain, and felt it as flavored electric shocks that jolted through his body.  Every once in a while a quiet little laugh would escape him during the beating.  Of course, the laugh infuriated them.  One of them pulled out a small club and smashed it across Hedron's knee.<P>This had pulled a hollow belly laugh from Hedron.  It roared out.  And once it was out there, it kept bubbling over.  The two men were driven to greater heights of fury by this, and shoved their "victim" out of his chair and onto the ground, kicking and beating him as he lay there, curled up... still laughing as hard as anyone ever had in their lives.<P>After awhile, they had grown bewildered and vaguely uneasy about this laughing man who refused to feel pain.  They looked at each other for an instant, backed away a bit, and turned and walked out - swaggering with a pretended bravado where none was left - the laughter had drained it right out of them.<P>As they left, Hedron lay there on his side, a small splash of his blood pooling by his face.  His eyes lit up for an instant, and the fingers of his left hand stretched out and grabbed power, beginning to shape it.  But as the forces coalesced, Hedron's concentration shattered again into fragments of laughter.  The simple idea of those two peasants beating The False Prophet in a cheap tavern, and living past it was just too amusing to smash.  So he had let it be.<P><BR>Hedron continued dragging his now useless leg down the street, seeing his way with the one eye that could still see.  It amused him to keep his souvenirs.  He wasn't sure where he was going, only that restlessness and dissatisfaction had driven him from the tavern.<P>Hedron<BR><a href="http://www.kaaos.com/hedron/falseprophet.htm" target="_blank">The False Prophet</a><BR><a href="http://www.kaaos.com" target="_blank">KAAOS</a><P>...No child, don't cry.

         <BR>Night had fallen.  The crowd was gone.<P>Only Hedron remained, sitting in the middle of an empty square, still rattling his cup and begging to no one.  He wasn't laughing any more.<P>65, 66...<P>Heh.  He had stopped caring.  Did it matter, really?  He knew that the things that you do should be guaged by some measure which tells of success or failure.  But he had come to realize that success and failure are relative concepts.<P>Today he had collected almost a gold piece for doing nothing of any value to anyone - including himself. A quite good return to trade nothing for something.  He laughed.  In the meantime, with the wave of his hand, he could summon more treasure than could be found on this pathetic little world.  Treasures bought at the price of tremendous expenditures of vicious energy and at the cost of the lives and civilizations which he had snuffed out, like candles.  Which was the better measure of success?<P>It was interesting to him how his mind slipped around the real matters that weighed on his soul, and turned towards this garbage.  Things used to be about the savage enjoyment that you wrung from life with your own hands.  The costs or the return were not counted - only feeling the burning energy of the DOING mattered.<P>With a disgusted wave, Hedron forced buring energy through his veins, and healed his "souvenirs".  Standing, he threw the cup of coppers into the night.  They rang like bells as the bounced across the broad flagstones that made up the surface of the marketplace.<P>An intense non-light halo enveloped his body, and began to grow.  In a sudden jerking twist of reality, a hammer of eldritch power poured out of the sky and into Hedron.  From him, it burst outward in a wave of flames and forces, blowing apart buildings, walls, and people in a terrible roar of destruction.<P>As it ended, only Hedron stood.  All else was ash and rubble.  A single flagstone survived - the one on which he stood.  And somewhere, in the remains of  distant hovel, two "toughs" lay in cocoons of protection that slowly faded away.  They had been preserved.<P>Hedron<BR><a href="http://www.kaaos.com/hedron/falseprophet.htm" target="_blank">The False Prophet</a><BR><a href="http://www.kaaos.com" target="_blank">KAAOS</a><P>...No child, don't cry.

Only his terror vibrated out of his body in waves and currents while he struggled to move and could not.<P>The thing rushed into his mouth as he screamed, it flooded into his nostrils, it poured into his eyes, it crawled into his ears, and strangled itself around his throat.  His eyes widened in silence as it felt its way down his throat, and dripped into his lungs.  A force - an imperative - a DEMAND welled up from every portion of him, INSISTING that there be breath.  There was not.<P>For long eternities he lay there, feeling his body dying by milimeters.  His eyes strained to burst from his head, and his chest sucked at the vacuum till it felt like it would collapse.<P>Small thoughts fired through his brain like sparks off of a dying fire.  Images and scenes.  A women, beautiful and nude straddled him, rising and falling as he thrust upward.  A street blown by a fierce wind stretched in front of him as he walked along.  His father snarled and rushed towards him.  A knife fell from the darkness towards him, and met with his hand, rising to block.  He stared down at his breakfast - eggs and ham.  A carriage roared across the road in front of him, clipping his shoulder with a wheel guard.  Two men carried a log toward the beginnings of a small house.<P>Flicker and burn out.  Each memory chased through him, and faded.<P>Underlying it all was a sense of himself that felt a bubbling mix of anger, fear, panic and sadness - the part of him that knew he was dying.  It was a quiet part, muffled to quietness while lethargy and the poisons of his own body swirled up and slowly drowned him inside his own skin.<P>a flash. dhhhhhhhhhhharkness.<P>.<P><BR>.<P><BR>.<P><BR>.<P>.<P><BR>Damarico convulsed, and gasped in a breath like a man clawing for a rope to save him as he falls off a cliff.  His chest heaved and his eyes bled with the effort of pouring air, sweet air, into his lungs.<P>After minutes of gulping and laboring, his senses returned and his heart slowed, and his cells stopped screaming for oxygen.  Every shred of him was exhausted by the near suffocation.  For an hour he lay there, simply breathing - his rough features smoothed into serenity by a single fact - he was alive.<P>Eventually he sat up.  The destruction around him, and the corpse that greeted him were surprises.  His friend lay dead.  Filish's mouth gaped in a way that Damarico found far too familiar, and far to personally meaningfull.<P>With a groan, Damarico stood and looked around, his blood-shot eyes blinking at what was left of the city he had lived in.<P>"Holy Mother of Fuck."<P><BR>Hedron<BR><a href="http://www.kaaos.com/hedron/falseprophet.htm" target="_blank">The False Prophet</a><BR><a href="http://www.kaaos.com" target="_blank">KAAOS</a><P>...No child, don't cry.

         <blockquote>
         <BR>Betrayal is a hard thing to take.  Some days it wrenches at your guts, and others it just rests there, nestled among your insides but not stirring.  You can almost forget it's there.  Until it moves again.<P>It's as though it's a knife.  It slides into your chest - it slices through your skin, quietly sneaks between the bones of your rib, and finally eases its way into your heart.<P>But it's so sharp you don't feel it.  Instead it just seems like motion... unseen, barely felt motion in your organs.  But oh, it's a knife.  There's no mistaking that, because when betrayal comes out of its cocoon, and metamorphs into it's final form... well, it's inside of you when it does that.  And that knife is jerked and pulled, hacking through you.  Some of the cuts are razor-clean, others are jagged and torn.<P>I had been betrayed.  I am forced to face that.  But even now, it's a hard thing to accept.  The worst part about betrayal is that despite all the parts of you that hurt and bleed, there is some other pitiful piece of you that wants desparately to have never been betrayed.  Whatever the cost of that denial, that is what it wants.  How futile.<P>When I think about removing the knife, this piece of me... it cries out, and clutches at the knife, driving it deeper by fractions into my heart.  It refuses to let go of it.  It has failed to recognize the knife for what it is, and it seems at times that it never will.<P>Of course that doesn't stop me from knowing that I have a knife in my chest... a dancing macabre knife.  It just leaves me in a position where there is nothing I can do about it.<P>I feel the tears on my cheeks. They're both warm and cool.  They soothe me as they drag me deeper into the things that cause them.  They are --- foreign.  And it seems I cannot contemplate them without either the most intense of angers, or the most detached of emotionless analysis.  Anger was earlier... now I was thinking again... endlessly.<P>She had helped me build a world, and then it had fallen.  She had fallen.  We had built it, and she had said she wanted it, and believed in it, and was part of it - that it would endure.<P>More.  She had said that the world... was only a world... that it was me above all that she was a part of, and I had said that it was her above all that I was a part of.  THAT was the commitment that rang out with purity and force.  THAT was the whisper that covered the sound of the blade sliding into my chest.<P>THAT was the lie.  I know that she lied to me.  I suspect that she lied to herself.  But apparently, I was more taken in by her deceptions than she was.  How naive.  How... mortal.<P>I feel my hand itching for the Twisted Cross... clutching at air as though to draw power from the weapon that I do not carry now.  I had imprisoned the after-image of her soul that had remained in me within the cross.  And then I had left it to leech back out of the cross into a distant world where it could claim no part of me again.  I would not go near it, or some weakness in me would pull it back into myself.<P>At that thought, the tears bleed from my eyes again, and the snarl twists my features again.  A rage fires inside of me that beats at the walls of my head, screaming to get out.  But I will not release it.  The city around me has already paid the price for that rage, and nothing else near me is left to pay it again.  So I wall it away in my head, and let it force the tears from my eyes, and they boil away as they roll down my cheeks, just as the tears of others once boiled on the Twisted Cross.<P>The worms crawl behind my forehead.<BR>The knife jerks inside my heart.<P><BR>Hedron<BR><a href="http://www.kaaos.com/hedron/falseprophet.htm" target="_blank">The False Prophet</a><BR><a href="http://www.kaaos.com" target="_blank">KAAOS</a><P>...No child, don't cry.
