&gt;A true classic... - Ritual<P>LOL... it was definitely one of my favorite EQ moments. I especially like the 4 silver. The guy finally sent me a tell about an hour later, saying that his hands had finally stopped shaking enough to type. <P>Turned out he had just sold a fat item (I think it was an Iksar BP - shows you how long ago it was), and for some reason his dumb ass was standing outside the bank in OT as I happened by. He was pretty cool about the whole deal, all things considered; he knew he had fucked up. And no, I didn't give any of it back. I offered the 4 silver, which he didn't find very funny. <P>Wheeeeeeeee...<P>This was in the days when lighties could get ally faction in OT by killing in HS until your faction "rolled over." Was fun as hell to go rampaging around the OT outpost with our shorty squad, attacking everyone with impunity. Freaked people out. It also allowed me to stroll in there and bank his cash before I could get ganked. ;D<P>As far as I know, it's the record for a PvP cash loot in EQ. There was a thread on one of the big EQ forums a while back, and the biggest I saw other than mine was something like 12k.<P><P>Joker<BR>God of "ching!"<P><P><P>

Muhahahahahahaa.<P>OT + HS.  Wrathbringers owning the darkie bank/dungeon.  Too much fucking fun.  There were days when nobody in range of us could bank.  2 rogues, mage, enchanter and usually a random druid.  Just camping in the OT bank, listening to the shouts about us.  LMFAO.<P>

Yeah but he had the last laugh......he encumbered yer ass ;p Brings back memories of the UO days before they put in the weight limit restrictions on the old Kal Ort Por. Having to tp back and forth until you could unload all the loot kind of sucked.<P>SangDraxx<BR>KAAOS<BR>The Serpent Lord<P><BR>

LOL, that one freaking night in that one dungeon (forget the name now), that was the funniest shit ever. We killed so many people, after looting we couldn't walk. Everytime I think back on Sang saying "I'm overloaded,I can't move" and me yelling "just keep killing FUCK" and people continuing to fall around us as none of us could move cracks me the fuck up.

Yeah well now that we have the UO memories flowing I still harbor great resentment(;p) over the time we had the mock duel in our tower with the generalized statement of "we will just go till one of us almost dead and then stop". After those instructions and a brief skirmish I recall only being able to say OOOoOOOoooooooOO. BITCH!! Heh!<P>SangDraxx<BR>KAAOS<BR>The Serpent Lord<P><BR>

Hmmmmmmmmmmmm. I recall someone wanting to spar me but I never took those "mock duels" seriously so I never did it.  A match is a match and sometimes a mage can get close to no health and bounce back fast in Ultima. This is becouse they never really made it fair for the warrior. The only way I would fight a mage one on one is with 25 or so total refreshes with archery, magic clothing with reflect or hiding, and a prayer.<P> And for you to harbor great resentment means you have low self esteem. Some great basketball players missed the basket many times but that never got them down.

Geo, <P>Sang’s post was directed at me. He was remembering back, with amusement, when he and I sparred in UO. I told him we wouldn’t fight to the death, just very nearly. But, I killed him on purpose and laughed at his stupid ghost ass as I looted him ;p<P>Of course, that’s not as bad as the time I sparred Riprend (another KAAOSer) in Diablo on the hardcore server (when your character dies there it dies for good). We weren’t to fight to the death but, um, I couldn’t help myself muahahahaha. Suckit. He recreated another character and came in at level 1 and I laughed at his dumb ass as I tossed him the ear of his former self ;p <P>Azmodion<BR>KAAOS<BR>
