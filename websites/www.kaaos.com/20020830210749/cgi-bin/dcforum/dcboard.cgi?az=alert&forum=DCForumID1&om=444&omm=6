"And you are??? Oh yeah nothing to me"

The mere fact that you sit at your keyboard waiting for a response from your gods shows what we mean to you. We are the cream in your coffee,a means to your end, the light at the end of your tunnel. Without KAAOS recognition you would simply fade away into nothingness. The pure simplicity of your nature and your presence on these boards denotes the obvious to everyone skippy. 

"Doesnt change the fact and you seem to "omit" it that you joined forces to keep your numbers high because you were slipping. Face it.. own up to it... and we have plenty of screenshots of Feyd's death at our members hands so if you wanna play this game.."

Hmmm I must have missed something in your incoherent ramblings. Where did I omit anything? We have been playing togather as Infernal Elite on Tallon Zek for monthes now monkey boy. Again I ask that you get your facts straight before you make an ass of your self in public. As for your screenshots of this guy's death neither I nor the rest of KAAOS could give a damn what the east commonlands crowd are doing to pass their time. You keep right on a fighting the brave battle over there punk.

"Your getting owned hardcore.. you suck because Eye of Newt killed a member of yours.. you pansie.."\

Take a look at the daily rankings and tell me who is getting owned hardcore. I surely don't see TCE anywhere near the top 10 much less the number one spot like IE.

"You chickened out.. and joined another guild so you can claim dominance... wow im impressed. "

We don't claim dominance, we exude it. Everything about us  lnspires fear and awe from gutter rats like yourselves. We are the top rung of the evolutionary ladder while you son are merely the puddle at the bottom. Back to east commonlands with you.
