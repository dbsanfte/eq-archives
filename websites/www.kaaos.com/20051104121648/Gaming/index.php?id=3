                                  <p><font size="-1">Well, damn, I just found 
                                    this whole thread. Here's my thoughts:<br>
                                    <br>
                                    PVP Goal #1 - PvP Should be Entertaining<br>
                                    <br>
                                    In order for PvP to be truly entertaining 
                                    for BOTH (the key here is BOTH) parties, whether 
                                    they be single players or whole guilds, it 
                                    depends on the following:<br>
                                    <br>
                                    1) There has to be some measure of skill involved.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    You can't expect combat to be really entertaining 
                                    and fun if it's extremely mindless. Look at 
                                    EQ. It sucks PVPwise. Why? Because you have 
                                    very few options. You can memorize very few 
                                    spells. Each class has one predetermined way 
                                    of fighting. If you are a wizard, root and 
                                    nuke. If you X, do Y. The end. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Instead of that, we need: If he does X, I 
                                    can do A, B, or C. For the other person, he 
                                    will need to react to A, B, or C with D, E, 
                                    or F. This is like chess. For each move, there 
                                    is more than one possible response. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Now, I know some of this is already in place 
                                    in SB. But, the key is, there needs to be 
                                    working countermeasures that can be used quickly 
                                    and efficiently, even if you are not the one 
                                    that initiated combat. Which leads into:<br>
                                    <br>
                                    2) It needs to have a slower pace, not faster.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Damage cannot come in huge bursts if you want 
                                    there to be skill involved. If I can nuke 
                                    someone for 200 points of damage and they 
                                    have 250 hps and I get the first shot off, 
                                    I will probably win. However, if I can nuke 
                                    them for 20, and they have 250 hps, this allows 
                                    them to conduct some sort of defensive maneuver, 
                                    throw up a damage shield, something to reflect 
                                    a spell, something to absorb a spell, something. 
                                    The key is they can act and do something. 
                                    They don't need to be reeling from the initial 
                                    blow.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Again, look at EQ. A wizard can nuke someone 
                                    for like 2000 points of damage at higher levels. 
                                    That is debilitating in an ungodly way. What 
                                    can you do if you get hit for full damage 
                                    besides run or sit there and cry? <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Since we're talking real time combat here, 
                                    the amount of damage needs to take into effect 
                                    that people need to think for a moment, need 
                                    to click here or there to get a spell or attack 
                                    off. If damage is insanely high, it will partially 
                                    defeat PVP being fun. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    The problem is, possibly, like in EQ... high 
                                    level mobs have a billion hit points. That 
                                    same wizard needs to be able to nuke for 2000 
                                    damage, because that is only 5% of the monsters 
                                    total life. That same sort of ratio needs 
                                    to be kept in PVP.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    PVP Goal #2 - I want Lots of PVP! What is 
                                    the Delay?!<br>
                                    <br>
                                    1) Why a time penalty is necessary.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    A time penalty is necessary to prevent people 
                                    from hopping right back into a fight. If you 
                                    die and there is a big war going on, you shouldn't 
                                    spawn ready to go jump right back into said 
                                    war. Also, there should be repercussions to 
                                    death. No permanent ones, but a temporary 
                                    thing like this is probably necessary so that 
                                    people learn to respect death, and want to 
                                    live. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Hell, if the effect was more debilitating, 
                                    it might even make it more of a rush to PVP. 
                                    Perhaps if you could challenge someone to 
                                    a duel in a specific area, where no one else 
                                    could interfere... and consenting to this 
                                    duel would flip on a special flag. This flag 
                                    would make, say, an hour long death effect 
                                    stay on your character and broadcast a message 
                                    to the world. Or to a special message board. 
                                    Or something. Then we get a mini 'trophy' 
                                    and some adrenaline rush. Of course, they 
                                    would need to be ways to prevent others from 
                                    joining in, but still, I digress...<br>
                                    <br>
                                    2) What should the penalty be?<br>
                                    <br>
                                    This is the tough question. The penalty needs 
                                    to be severe enough that people do not want 
                                    to die. But, it also needs to not discourage 
                                    people from playing or create a feeling of 
                                    'this really sucks.'<br>
                                    <br>
                                    a) Items - I feel the item penalty to should 
                                    be next to nothing. This is the kind of thing 
                                    which promotes bad, bad, bad things. It can 
                                    discourage people from carrying items (naked 
                                    mage syndrome when pvp'ing) or it can lead 
                                    to random ganking (ie, I sneak up on you invisible 
                                    and kill you after you fight a monster and 
                                    are down to 3 hps, take all your stuff and 
                                    move on). Some of that may be fine from time 
                                    to time, but it can easily become an epidemic 
                                    which makes the game less of a pvp world.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    b) Experience - Well, this all depends on 
                                    how easy the experience is to get in the final 
                                    version. If it remains similar to gaining 
                                    experience now, sure, I have no problem to 
                                    an experience penalty. If it is like EQ, where 
                                    a death can equate to hours of real life time, 
                                    then no. Some form of penalty wouldn't be 
                                    horrible, as long as, again, it is not discouraging. 
                                    If you die a couple times in level 55 in Everquest 
                                    and can't get a resurrection, you'll be wanting 
                                    to quit.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    c) Time - Some duration of time, 5-10 minutes 
                                    may not be a bad thing. As long as you can't 
                                    be killed during the period also. You need 
                                    to be safe until you are able to fight at 
                                    full strength again. This can also lead to 
                                    a period of time where people can sit around 
                                    and talk, something which is necessary to 
                                    the community aspect. If nothing else, it 
                                    will serve as a deterrant to dying. People 
                                    need to want to live. People need to get that 
                                    rush, that fear when they see their health 
                                    bar dropping down towards empty.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    3) How does this relate to PVP Goal #3?<br>
                                    <br>
                                    When people die, it provides a period of down 
                                    time, at least as far as combat goes. During 
                                    this 'time out' period, if there was some 
                                    medium where people could communicate, some 
                                    kind of chat medium for all deceased, deathshrouded 
                                    players, or some such, that would allow more 
                                    opportunity for talking to other combatants 
                                    who have met your similar fate. Things like 
                                    this are what create rivalries, as much as 
                                    player X ganking player Y. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    PVP Goal #3 - Strong Vibrant Community<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Interactions cannot just be combat related. 
                                    People need to be able to talk to each other. 
                                    They need to be able to talk trash, to learn 
                                    other's personalities, to interact in some 
                                    way where they don't have to be worried about 
                                    being raped by at any moments notice. There 
                                    will be ample places for the combat to happen, 
                                    but there also need to be places for non-combat 
                                    interactions to happen. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    In Neverwinter Nights (turn based) you could 
                                    chat during the combat. This is ideal. However, 
                                    it is also implausible in a real time game. 
                                    In NWN, there were also inns where players 
                                    had to go to rest safely, where people gathered 
                                    and talked. This sort of thing is essential 
                                    to creating a more immersive PVP world. If 
                                    I don't know or care about the other guy, 
                                    know how he acts, know what angers him, then 
                                    I am missing out on a key factor of the world. 
                                    With a strong community, it can help alleviate 
                                    the random ganking (player killing) and promote 
                                    a more intense form of combat. In NWN, players 
                                    created tournaments, ladders, and other ways 
                                    to test each other's skills on a more or less 
                                    level playing field. With a strong community, 
                                    this can happen. With a weak community, you 
                                    have UO: Enter dungeon, Corp Por anything 
                                    that moves, loot, leave. Woo.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    PVP Goal #4 - Group A vs Group B OR Powergamers 
                                    vs Normal Humans<br>
                                    <br>
                                    The Powergamers will always have tons of stuff 
                                    and advance quickly and be able to replace 
                                    items quickly. As a result of this, it is 
                                    often the case that Group A forces a tougher 
                                    code on the land. By that, I mean that the 
                                    powers that be try to make it harder for them 
                                    to do what they do. This, in turn, crushes 
                                    and penalizes Group B, the normal people, 
                                    more than anything. The Powergamers will adapt 
                                    and still roll. The normal humans will, instead, 
                                    be punished.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Let's relate this to another real world game: 
                                    golf. You have the Tiger Woods (Group A) and 
                                    the Jeff Maggert (Group B). Tiger hits the 
                                    ball 300 yards. Jeff hits it 250 yards. Tiger 
                                    shoots an ungodly low score. Jeff shoots a 
                                    decent score. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    The Powers that be decide to make it tougher 
                                    for Tiger. They lengthen every hole on every 
                                    course by 75 yards. Who does this penalize? 
                                    The longer hitting Tiger? Or the shorter hitting 
                                    Jeff? Tiger can still crush the ball and have 
                                    easy shots. Jeff, however, gets left even 
                                    farther behind because he was shorter to BEGIN 
                                    with. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    So, the key is to focus on the normal humans. 
                                    They are the bread and butter of the game. 
                                    They pay the bills. They outnumber the powergamers. 
                                    The miniority group, Group A, cannot set the 
                                    standards, because it's just not fair to everyone 
                                    else. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    1) Loot - Item loot sucks, pretty much for 
                                    everyone, except the person who is doing the 
                                    killing. It promotes a greed based opportunistic 
                                    combat system, which I would argue is incredibly 
                                    bad for combat as a whole. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    2) Death Penalties - Everyone should have 
                                    death penalties, but I'm not certain a level 
                                    10 person should have the same penalty as 
                                    a level 50 person. The lower level people 
                                    will have it harder, know less, and get killed 
                                    more often. You definitely don't want to discourage 
                                    someone who is new to the game, as if you 
                                    lose them early on, you will never get them 
                                    back. The level 50 person will have learned 
                                    to respect life and avoid death, so they will 
                                    know if they die, bad things will happen. 
                                    Some kind of gradual progression in death 
                                    effects would seem appropriate, to a degree, 
                                    if possible.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    ITEMS, ITEMS, ITEMS!<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Let's examine loot/item rules on a bunch of 
                                    games and then I'll expound upon their PVP 
                                    successes and failures.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    1) Neverwinter Nights<br>
                                    <br>
                                    No looting. Whatever items you had, you kept, 
                                    always. The end result? People PVPed. They 
                                    created tournaments. They created ladders 
                                    to test PVP skill. There were no worries about 
                                    constantly outfitting your character. No worries 
                                    about having to spend hours replacing the 
                                    items that someone looted off of you when 
                                    you got a lag spike and died. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    No Loot. Great PVP. There was nothing else 
                                    to really do EXCEPT to PVP.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    2) Ultima Online<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Full looting. However, the key to ultima was, 
                                    all items sucked (except a few unbalanced 
                                    weapons). All items were easily replaced in 
                                    about 2 minutes. When we used to raid, you 
                                    could outfit someone else in platemail and 
                                    a bow in the snap of your fingers. The end 
                                    result? People PKed. They were out and about, 
                                    trying to kill people. Sure, you had to worry 
                                    about losing all of your loot, but your loot 
                                    wasn't anything special anyways. Still, the 
                                    game was flawed in the PVP department, so 
                                    the combat wasn't spectacular and barely, 
                                    if at all, turned into anything more than 
                                    just raiding and killing unexpecting people. 
                                    Every now and then a couple raiding groups 
                                    would meet up and it would be entertaining.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Full Loot. Item Economy = Incredibly easy 
                                    to get. OK PVP, but mainly faulted because 
                                    of the system and lack of desire by majority 
                                    of the player base.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    3) EverQuest<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Items mean everything in EQ. Just look at 
                                    playerauctions.com. Items are so important 
                                    to your character and to your feeling of advancement 
                                    that they sell for hundreds of dollars. This 
                                    is bad. This creates an economy where all 
                                    you want to do is get items and then get some 
                                    more items after that. If you can never be 
                                    happy with your items, you'll never move on 
                                    to the PVP world.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    In an economy driven by items that make your 
                                    character powerful, it is difficult to have 
                                    fair PVP also. If Player X has God Item A, 
                                    then he will always beat Player Y. This is 
                                    bad.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Even on the EQ PVP servers, items play a huge 
                                    part in everything. Rallos Zek (one item loot 
                                    rules), I am certain, has a lot of opportunistic 
                                    kills, to try and rape someone of an item. 
                                    On the flip side, I am sure no one wants to 
                                    be out and about with their godly items, either. 
                                    Too much chance. You die and lose a godly 
                                    item, you are set back hours or days or weeks. 
                                    Sullon Zek (no looting, except coins) did 
                                    better and had a lot of PVP. This was a step 
                                    in the right direction, as people no longer 
                                    had to worry abou that set back factor.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Unfortunatley, EQ PVP has/had so many unfixable 
                                    flaws, that it's more or less irrelevenat 
                                    anyways. But the RZ and SZ server still show 
                                    an example of how items affect PVP.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Finally! The End! Oh Wait! "PVP WILL ALWAYS 
                                    HAPPEN, SO SAYS WARDEN!"<br>
                                    <br>
                                    This is untrue. Ganking may always happen. 
                                    But PVP will NOT always happen. Sure, every 
                                    game has people who will kill someone else 
                                    given the opportunity. But, that's not what 
                                    we're looking for. We want a skill based, 
                                    community oriented, world of combat. And unless 
                                    certain factors like minimal penalties and 
                                    item looting problems are addressed, this 
                                    world will not come to fruition.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
