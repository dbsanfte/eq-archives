    The initial concept of KAAOS took form in 1992, on AOL, in Neverwinter Nights. A bored assassin
  named Malhavok, and an evil companion named Chaosium grew weary of Neverwinter and it's environs.
 They sought to create a Guild of the purest evil, and a blossoming new land called Yserbius, on The Sierra
  Network, beckoned them and their creation. But what to call it? Early on, the name 'Guild Of Death' was
  tossed around. We would call ourselves GOD's. (See? Didn't come from where ya thought. ;p). But that
    was replaced when the suggestion Killing As An Organized Sport was mentioned. Besides, KAAOS
                                 sounded cooler than Guild of Death. ;)
</p>
  They journeyed to Yserbius with 4 or 5 stalwart friends and set up shop in the Hell Hole. Early on, even
    before the game went "live", the role-playing citizens of TSN (now known as the financially troubled
  ImagiNation Network) had but two choices in Guilds: the goodies known as Soul's Brigade, and the evils
 known as KAAOS. Soul's Brigade arrived first...setting up a large foundation of members, before KAAOS'
 arrival. There was no "game" yet to speak of, but the role-playing message boards were alive with tales of
     how Soul's Brigade or KAAOS would rule the new realms. Time passed and Malhavok and his few
 companions dabbled in the fine art of "member acquisition". The creator of Soul's Brigade, SoulForge, had
  a grand vision of domination, but his pride, lack of diplomacy skills and ego all played into the hands of
   KAAOS. First, the Soul's Brigade's AGMs saw the glory of KAAOS, then the other members became
 enlightened. Ulitmately, a mere week before The Shadow of Yserbius went live, Soul's Brigade disbanded
                     and KAAOS grew strong, taking only the most select members.

 Many guilds claimed to have been the "first" guild in TSN's Shadow of Yserbius, including many stragglers
  from the defunct Soul's Brigade (now a "Soul-less" Brigade). Believe me when I tell you, from a purely
 historical view, KAAOS was the *1st* fully formed, organized Guild to set foot into TSOY. Malhavok and
 Chaosium personally made the very *1st* non-staff posts on the message boards inside the game. Take it
                                              to the bank.
