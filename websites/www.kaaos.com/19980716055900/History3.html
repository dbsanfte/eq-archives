     KAAOS started as a non-sanctioned guild and struggled to make a name for itself in Neverwinter.
 Malhavok's reputation from his former presence in NW preceeded him, and he quickly developed a large
     following of old time, veteran NWN'ers. A mere 5 months after applying for non-sanctioned guild
 acceptance, KAAOS was awarded Sanctioned Guild of Neverwinter status and was well on it's way into the
  Neverwinter history books. While KAAOS thrived in Neverwinter, tales of the remnants of KAAOS on
      Yserbius reached Malhavok's ears. A weak and liberal recruitment process? No more Hell Hole
     meetings?! No more live evil sayings?!? No more KAAOS DeathHunts?!?! RULES and LAWS for
 KAAOS?!? WHAT the hell was going on!??! Malhavok was not amused. He severed all ties with Yserbius's
             KAAOS and thought no more of those who had lost the TRUE spirit of KAAOS.
</p>
<p>
 Today in Neverwinter, KAAOS continues kicking ass. In Neverwinter, Player Vs. Player combat is a game
   within itself, and requires not only luck and the best equipment, but a strategy aspect worthy of anyone
 willing to take the time to learn the finer points. As in the old days when Doomers, Merculus, Chaosium,
    War Lance and Malhavok struck fear into the hearts of Yserbius, the names of Rellikk, Slayve, Doc
    Krypto, Stilborn, Mad Drunk, Kal Mirage, Xardak, P1rate and Hedron do the same to Neverwinter.
</p>
<p>
  When Neverwinter ran Quests 2 or 3 times a year, the newly formed KAAOS ruled. Taking 2nd place in
   their first realms-wide quest, KAAOS went on to dominate the next 4 realms-wide Quests and take 1st
   place! KAAOS won every Quest for a year straight. Soon after KAAOS' stranglehold on these events,
   realms-wide Quests started becoming rarer and rarer, down to only 1 a year. (Some say, the constant
    dominance of KAAOS caused the powers that be to stop sponsoring Quests altogether. Hehehe! ;>).
</p>
<p>
 With Quests no longer occupying folks' attention, PVP Tournaments soon became all the rage. Now with
  4 major PVP ladders, one look at the Trophy Room of the Gods, and you'll see the tradition of KAAOS
     excellence remains intact as the Gods and Goddesses rule nearly every one. With over *9* PVP
   Champions (the most by FAR over any other guild) KAAOS seeks to accept only the most skilled and
 dedicated players. Testimony to this, KAAOS recently won a Neverwinter-wide Guild PVP Championship,
  a tournament where 20 other Guilds' teams pitted their PVP prowess against each other in battles to the
     death to determine the best. KAAOS not only won the Championship, but remained *undefeated*
                                    throughout the entire tournament!
