Never fly.

If you take flight, the air and the sky will touch you.

Never fly.  Never fly.

If you take flight, the sun and the clouds will brush you.

Crawl, and scrape.  Dig and burrow.  Bury your snout in the ground - snorting and coughing and snuffling the worms into your head.  Let them writhe and crawl just behind the bone of your forehead.

It's in the dirt, in the earth, in the rock, in the close and moist embrace of the same clammy soil that takes us when we're dead that there is saftey.

Never fly.  Never fly. You can't die
If you never leave your grave.

The grave's a funny place.  It isn't one until there's death in it.  Until then, it's only a hole.  What makes it a grave?

Tears tracked down Hedron's cheeks while a snarl twisted his features into a mask of hatred.  Sadness never touched The False Prophet.  And now that it was touching him, something in him was reacting like an immune system, fighting the infection with anger and hatred.  The twisting of his features was the torch of his will trying to burn out the sadness.

But the sadness was like blankets of snow, falling in heavy heavy layers.  The anger flared bright - a burning point that melted through every layer of snow.  But all around it, a cold, sound-absorbing hybernation enveloped his senses and feelings.

Finally, when the snowfall stopped, Hedron looked around at the miles and miles of snow.  He let the anger wink out.  For a moment he stood, listening... straining to hear the quiet settling of the snow as gravity pulled it downward - imperceptibly packing it down.

...No child, don't cry.  Your tears only boil away on the Twisted Cross.  It's your blood that soaks in deep.  Your blood...
