1. Good does not always win, although they do get 95% or more of the victories in the movies.<P>2. They are given those victories so that the customers who pay $7+ per movie can go home happy that the good guys won (which is their team, since the majority of people think of themselves as good, despite whatever they do).<P>When you take the concept into actuality, and out of the singular imagination of a writer, good rarely wins. Good is at a very large disadvantage, they have rules to play by. Evil has fewer or no rules to play by. That is why most competitive games are ruled by people who claim to be evil. When it isn't ruled by evil, it is usually ruled by an overwhelming number of goodies.<P>Either way, I'm happy as long as they all die. <P>Mortarion<BR>god of death and decay

Thanks for the input. <P> Evil also gets more loot in games. They kill anything that gets in the way which is understandable since many people steal kills while hunting. But the number one reason people attack the same monster would be teamwork, but a person should ask first.
