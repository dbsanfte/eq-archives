<blockquote>A shadow emerges from the bushes and stops infront of some weary travellers. She tilts her head slightly and examines the new world around her.<P>"Excuse me," she begins, "Do you know where I am?" One of the travellers shaes his head and waves her away. Her eyes narrow and her face flushes in anger.<P>"Where am I?" she screams. Her ebony wings spread behind her and she keeps herself from withdrawing her sword. Again, the traveller ignores and walks on. "Then turn and look upon your death, know the name of which you disrespect."<P>The travellers turn and watch her keenly as she speaks in a very low tone, "I am Telara WindSong and nobody treats a daemoness as you do." The travellers stare at her and walk off, leaving her bewildered.<P>"Where have I come?" she murmurs. This setting was nothing at all like her beautiful realm of Sosaria, this was sparcely populated and still wild. Shuddering slightly, she walks on, unaware of her surroundings.<P>May you always hear the sound of the Star Dance,<BR>- Telara</blockquote><hr><b><font size=2>Table of contents</font></b><hr>
