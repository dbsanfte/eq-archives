<blockquote>Silence...<BR>  <BR>Oblivion?<BR>  <BR>No.  I can feel my limbs.  Move them no, but I can feel them.<BR>  <BR>What is this?<BR>  <BR>How long have I been asleep?<BR>  <BR>A cocoon? A prison perhaps?<BR>  <BR>No. Too conformed to my physical form.<BR>  <BR>Perhaps I'll rest awhile longer.  <BR>  <BR>....<BR>  <BR>  <BR>Vibrations?  <BR>  <BR>Listen. Yes I can do that.<BR> <BR>....<BR>  <BR>  <BR>Life, all around me.  But this shell holds me firm.  Shatter it? Not yet.  Pass through, that would be much easier for now.<BR>  <BR>Caverns.<BR>  <BR>Interesting..<BR>  <BR>Daylight.<BR>  <BR>Mountains. Children laughing?<BR>  <BR>Yes. A lot of them.  A large city stretches out before me.  Flying carriages, Huge metallic birds.<BR>  <BR>The future Perhaps?  <BR>  <BR>....<BR>  <BR>..<BR>  <BR>Inspection... Returning to my starting point on this rock, it seems to be the core of the planet.  How long had I fell through space?  <BR>  <BR>Time travel...<BR>  <BR>Watching my form float throw space.  Speed up time.  <BR>  <BR>Micro specks of dust cling too the form.  <BR>  <BR>How Long indeed?<BR>  <BR>The asteroid that I am/was floats and falls through space.<BR>  <BR>Stuck in the gravitational pull of a sun so like many others that support life on planets captured by there pull.<BR>  <BR>Stability.  The orbit is no longer erratic.<BR>  <BR>Water?<BR>  <BR>Eons perhaps?<BR>  <BR>Plants...<BR>  <BR>Early life.<BR>  <BR>Man.<BR>  <BR>And all from a sleeping god.<BR>  <BR>Careless to sleep that long?  Why? What could bother me?<BR>  <BR>But to bring life in such a manner.  That is positively amusing.<BR>  <BR>Return to the future.<BR>  <BR>Children laughing.<BR>  <BR>My children?<BR>  <BR>In a way I guess.<BR>  <BR>The core...<BR>  <BR>Held firm...<BR>  <BR>Sleep?<BR>  <BR>No...<BR>  <BR>Shrug<BR>  <BR>The planet that was my cocoon shatters.<BR>  <BR>Sleep..<BR>  <BR>Yes....<P>Rann<BR>God of the Shadows<BR>KAAOS<BR></blockquote><hr><b><font size=2>Table of contents</font></b><hr>
