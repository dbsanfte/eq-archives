----------------------------------------------------
My opinion of KAAOS has definitely gone up since that one night a few weeks ago. Apparently a good number of you are actively seeking PvP in the sub 50 lvls. Ive noticed Blayloc in the top 20 for a while now, nice work. The whole reason for my initial disgust with KAAOS was based soley on a passed up opportunity at PvP that was laid right at your feet. Granted, you may have seen it differently then I because you werent outside among the newts and I was.... for a while. Anyway, that Befallen incident is long over and done with, so no sense beating a dead horse. 

Since then ive watched KAAOS and HoW (TCE) climb their way onto the boards. KAAOS's merger into the Sixth Circle alliance (Infernal Elite) has sent the combined scores pretty far up the boards. You guys simply have a completely different mind set going into this server than I do. You are there to dominate as much as humanly possible in a game that was never truly ment for PvP. Thats fine, if you want to dominate EQ be my guest, it seems be your guilds objective in any game you tackle. Me? Hell, im just there to get in some PvP action before SB comes out, screw domination =P. Of course im disappointed that you wouldnt accept the war, but the war only really suits my needs =). Obviously you have other plans in mind. 

Anyway, thought Id stop by and send a shout out to Rann, who graciously kicked my ass in a duel the other day. It was a good duel, had fun... and it was close. Yep, I lost and Im a TCE'er! Oh well, maybe next time. Anyway, I AM true to my word you can ask Rann about that, any time, any place. Ill duel you. Im not here to dominate the goddamn game. I cant fucking stand EQ. I hate spending 12+ hours for each fukin lvl. I hate sitting in a room camping some POS peice of loot for another 10 hours. I dont even like the PvP "all" that much. Im playing to get to know my guild, and my competition better. Ive been on the score board for "Top 20 evils Yesterday" twice now I think, Yay.... 

Anyway, nice to see the competition baring its fangs, hope to see you guys again... I want a rematch Rann *grin*. 

-Rek

PS- Im still gonna kick your ass in SB =P.
