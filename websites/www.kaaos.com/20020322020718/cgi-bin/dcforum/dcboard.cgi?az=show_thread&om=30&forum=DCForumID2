          <blockquote>
          <P><P>Flashes of lightning blink multi-hued through an ornate stained glass window..<BR>Mortar drifts from the walls in torrents as the arched ceiling trembles.<BR>Some might mistake it for dust, but not here..not in this holiest of holy places. Here in the sanctum of the All-Father, Mithaniel Marr, Paladine, Fizban, and whatever names men know him by, the priests allow not a fleck of dirt.<BR>Through torrents of rain, a figure observes the moon through a temple window.<BR> Even in the depths of the Abyss, the death knights of Takhisis take cover. Hurling entrails and expletives at them like an unholy barrage of rotted flesh, the dark queen screams in futility, repeating the same words over and over.<BR> “It is not time…..not the time yet….the world is not ready”.<BR>Tonight rages a maelstrom of elemental fury unlike anything seen since the cataclysm, which some men call the sundering. On this dark eve, the alternate planes of Dereth, Norrath, Krynn, and Aerynth all tremble beneath the torrent from a black sky. Yet only an hour before, many enjoyed a quiet winter evening..warming a cup of mulled wine by the fire. Legends such as foretold the coming of this storm had thankfully been lost among the ages.<BR> In the Norrathian town of Freeport, Sir Lucan of the Militia stands atop the gates in West Freeport, a puzzled look upon his face. “Damned seers assured me we’d have a dry night tonight. “. “Marcius!”, he bellows, “Gather the men from the whorehouses in east towne…we’ve a rough storm ahead”. The odor of sulfur wafts along with the breeze, and his countenance lifts to the shining pinnacle of the Temple of Marr. The tattoo on his left bicep burns, a constant reminder of his broken vows to the Knights of Truth. Lucan had long ago forsaken any semblance of righteousness by butchering many members of his former brotherhood. Even now, he still remembers the sting of their words as they cast him out.<BR>                             “Doomed is he who chooses his ambition over the good of the church.”<BR> As an unnatural screaming erupts from the highest window of the temple, he takes no notice, so lost is he on thoughts of revenge.<P> “Hurry!”. Priests of Marr scramble over soft and flabby legs to the temple aviary. Pounding upon the bolted door, they flail away in abject horror as the unholy screams continue. “GODS…LOOK”. A young priest rises from his prostrate prayers with unrestrained terror on his face. His pale white feet and robe are stained with feces. As a river of offal, bile, and excrement rains down from the temple skylight, the Priests of Marr attempt to find a refuge. But if the servants of such a god are not safe within their own temple, is anyone?<P> Her eyes attempt to open, but feel as if they are gummed shut. She reaches up to open them, and with slimy fingers, pries apart her leaden eyelids. Within what was a beautiful chapel, she lies in a huge cesspool of waste and blood, unrecognizable as who she is. Her formerly white robes of clerical service are brownish red, and crusted to her body. Sleek black hair, that was adorned with the finest ribbons and jewels, lies knotted and in damp rolls around her shoulders. Having long since lost her voice, she still attempts to scream for the loyal priests to help her.<BR>Crystasia, daughter of Eluindel and beloved of the gods, is utterly alone for the first time in her life. Seeming some sort of slug, she drags herself along the floor, trailing mucus and a hundred other unnamed viscous fluids. Grasping a chair, she attempts to pull herself upright, even as she feels the first swelling within her womb.<P> Elsewhere, the Minotaur of Dargoth pay no heed to the advancing lightning. Engaged in their usual evening sport of deathmatch clan fighting, they intend to pick a new chief tonight. Let us have a glimpse of their combat while our story, gentle readers, plays out elsewhere.<BR> Goran the one handed swings his axe in anticipation, circling the other. Wiping blood from his hirsute brow, Velikor the savage, clan chieftan,  prepares to charge…sniffing the wind for any sign of fear or hesitation. As the two mighty beasts collide in a mighty collision of fur and steel, blood pours out upon the amber sands. As a headless body collapses to its knees, a new leader bellows his victory cry. Such is the way of these beast-men, and shall always be. Even as the storm rages about them, there are traditions to be obeyed…weaknesses to exploit, and wars to march. Even so, with the rolling fear of an animal in distress, more than one brave warrior turns his gaze to the sky, shaking with an unknown feeling of dread.<P> Crystasia opens her mouth to scream, but cannot. All that escapes her withering lips is the gurgling whisper of “helpppp”. As she feels her hips creak and snap, she prays for the release that death itself can only bring. Pounding her fists on the once immaculate floor, she denounces her god for abandoning her. <P> “Denounce him not, my love, for another star rises to the heavens in his place”<P> It is not the rumbling emanation of this voice which frightens her, nor its disembodied words hanging in the lonely chapel. It is the echo as it speaks from within her birthing canal. Wide mouthed, gaping….screaming a wordless scream that only she can hear, Crystasia is overtaken by darkness.<P>A man stands sopping wet upon the gates of Freeport..mouth agape in amazement, as he watches the Temple of Marr begin to crumble. Clutching an almost empty bottle of wine, Sir Lucan wastes no time in going to the mess hall for a replacement. Damned if he intends on remembering what he has witnessed.<P>Rythmic thumping awakens Crystasia from what she anticipated to be the fields of afterlife. As the shards of white bone project through her midsection, she struggles to raise herself upon her arms. She can only gaze wordlessly upon the apparition buried to the hilt between her legs.<P> “I don’t know whether to call you mother, wife or priestess. Wait a moment..it appears you’ve had a change of heart about the third title.”<P>Laughing with a glee that instantly causes death in several trembling priests, he plunges his phallus into her rapidly chilling body as the parapets begin to fall in ruins from the chapel.<P>“A child, a murderer, and a widower…and the night has just begun. Hold on mother..it has only begun to get interesting”<P> The heavy oaken doors burst asunder, and the bizarre figure strides out, as if in triumph. Attempting to rescue the bodies of their dead, the priests of Marr gape in sheer insanity at he who stands before them.<P>“Look…its raining shit…you’ve got a fucking skylight open in mid-storm…and my wife has deserted me…cant one of you devout religious men get me a rag to clean myself?”<P>“mmmmmmmmmmmmmm”. The noise rumbles from his back as he gathers the fleshy folds of flesh about his shoulders. With a sigh of annoyance, he reaches back and gently snaps her spinal cord.<P>“Priests of Marr, never let it be said that I am not humane. Besides, that infernal whimpering gives me the chills”<P> Grasping one half of her body cavity with each hand, he pulls the severed body ever closer, savoring the smell of the tainted flesh. Wrapping her pulverized legs around his middle, he appears a smiling university student, sporting a jaunty new jacket. Such is his demeanor as he waves goodbye to his newfound friends.<P> With a yawning crash, the temple of Marr collapses in on itself. Black rubble amid a river of slime, it would appear to be a sewer if not for the darkened emblem which formerly stood on the highest crest.<P> In the following days, though none dare enter the courtyard, many will describe it as some sort of twisted cross.<P> Goran awakes with an uneasy feeling which he immediately attributes to the drinking binge from the evening prior. Stumbling down to the shore, he sinks to his knees in the soft sands, splashing water upon his haggard, hairy frame. As the water runs red from his soiled arms, he swills the sea foam, washing the stale taste of Velikors still beating heart from his mouth. Exhaling deeply from his bovine nostrils, he smiles as the sun poured down upon his weathered brow. <BR> A shadow blots out the sun.<P> Snorting in rage, Goran whirls around, prepared to face the first challenger to his newly won title. It is a man! <P>“I know not how you got here, wretched idiot, but I’ll roast your carcass tonight for interrupting my bath”<P>With that, Goran lunges at the stranger, who is smiling with what suddenly appears to be sharpened teeth. Goran’s last thought is “What manner of man files his teeth like an animals?”<P>As morning progresses over Dargoth, the village becomes concerned. Search parties are formed, and a large group eventually makes its way to the beach. Bellowing in rage, the leader tramples the marsh grasses as he runs towards the pink mass hanging from a seaside tree. As he reaches it, he can only wonder what sort of creature would skin a foe and leave it alive. .<P>“Now friends…just listen…you wouldn’t have me running around naked would you? This damned pair of breeches chafes me as it is”<P> With hands lifted in the universal sign of friendship, the dark man approaches the trembling creatures. Palms up, he caresses their faces as they stand motionless.<BR> Falling to their knees in rank subjugation, the minotaurs pay homage to what they perceive as a god.<P>“Rise and face me, my new friends. We’ve much work to do”<P> He stands as only a medium sized man…six feet tall at most. None will remember later of what details his face holds, save only the bloodstained smile. What they never forget is the human carcass he apparently wears as a cloak, and the minotaur skin he bears as a sort of wrap for his lower body. More than one nightmare is caused by the affectionate manner in which he strokes and caresses the female corpse draped over his shoulders…even lovingly the legends will say. In a last memory, one of the scouts recalls that the dark man has seamless, unlined hands…with absolutely no marks, lines, or prints…<P> As the waves roll to the shore that evening, none notices the bloody imprints of a name being obscured in the sand.<BR>                                                                            Judas<P><BR>
