<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000">Of course, when one talks about KAAOS' punishment
of House ITB, one event stands out in particular...The Caning of ITB Wuss
in 1994! &nbsp;Yes, just as news hit of the punk in Singapore getting his
ass caned for vandalism, KAAOS administered it's own Caning punishment
to House ITB for Wussisism, right in the middle of NW Square. It was the
trial of the decade in Neverwinter. There was a Judge (Judge666), a Prosecutor
(Miss Pros), a Defending Attorney (DefAttorny), and even star witnesses
(ITB Mom, and ITB Goat). ;)</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000">The trial started only with a few onlookers
but news of the hilarious event quickly spread like wildfire throughout
the Realms and at least 60 people crowded NW Square to try and get a glimpse
of the historic trial. (60 people was a LOT in those days). It was totally
un-rehearsed and adlib'ed. The balif, NW Aerich, tried to maintain crowd
control, but with each new charge brought against ITB Wuss, the screen
was filled with laughter, and things quickly got out of hand.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000">Everybody who was anybody in those days was
in attendance. Kayn was there waving his Golden Staff, but the Judge quickly
ordered him arrested for displaying his staff in public. ITB's were there
too...and what a sight THIS was:</FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF80FF"> </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0080"><I>&quot;This
is fake! House ITB does not willingly participate in any of this! This
is totally against our wishes!&quot;</I>, </FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">were
their cries, to the crowd. But KAAOS would not be denied. <BR>
<BR>
Trying to be &quot;cool&quot; and hoping to play off the event, ITB Silent
(GM at the time) took the witness stand and the crowd went wild! A few
well placed jabs by Miss Pros, and ITB Silent fled the stand, never to
be seen again that night. Finally, the Judge called for the assembled crowd
(the jury of course), to render a verdict. One could have foreseen the
GUILTY verdict, a mile away ;&gt; So, as Judge666 took up his cane to administer
the punishment to ITB Wuss, ITB Mom pleaded for mercy for her wussy son...to
no avail. The Caning of ITB Wuss commenced, and one of the funniest damn
sights you will ever see in Neverwinter, was etched into the History books
of Neverwinter...and now available for your reading pleasure on the KAAOS
web page ;&gt;</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000">(A side note to this little event...the ITB's
really weren't amused by the Caning: 3 separate TOS violations were levelled
against the Gods that evening for...get this...&quot;Trying to ruin the
'good name' of House ITB&quot;. Heheheheh!! WHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE! Needless
to say, TOSAdvisor didn't think ITB was a &quot;good name&quot; to begin
with and promptly dismissed all such TOS charges. Worship it ;&gt; )</FONT></B></P>
