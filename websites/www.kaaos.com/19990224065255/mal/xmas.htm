as he left the Hell Hole christmas eve. <BR>
You can say there's no such thing as evil, but as for Skorp and the itties
they believe.</FONT></B></P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P><B><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">He had blown too many reindeer, stuff
was dripping from his chin. <BR>
But he had left his k.y. jelly, and now his asshole puckers way too thin.</FONT></B></P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P><B><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">The itties found him christmas morn'n,
had a smile upon this face. <BR>
There was fur around his asshole, but as for Blitzen (Frytzen) there was
no trace.</FONT></B></P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P><B><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">It's not christmas without itties,
all their women dressed in black. <BR>
But&nbsp;we just can't help but wonder, is that a overgrown clitoris or
a scrotum sac?</FONT></B></P></CENTER>

&quot;You better hurry!&quot; shouted Ashlar, &quot;here comes Blitzen
lookin' for his buttfucked bride.&quot;</FONT></B></P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P><B><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">Well ole Skorpuss finally woke up,
couldn't walk without a crutch, <BR>
The itties asked if it had hurt him,&nbsp;Skorp said &quot;Hey, I&nbsp;really

<CENTER><P><B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=+1>Twas the night before
Christmas in my generic victims' home,<BR>
and out in the city, KAAOS did roam.</FONT></FONT></B></P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P><B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=+1>We laid down to sleep
under our covers of fur, <BR>
Expecting a visit from yet another mass murderer.</FONT></FONT></B></P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P><B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=+1>The children were paniced
and wetting the bed, <BR>
Visions of KGFS pedophilia filling them with dread.</FONT></FONT></B></P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P><B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=+1>When downstairs I heard
such a shriek and a curse, <BR>
My balls crawled back up; puberty reversed.</FONT></FONT></B></P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P><B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=+1>The killer was here,
it was obvious now, <BR>
but this one was different, I just didn't know how.</FONT></FONT></B></P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P><B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=+1>I caught a whiff and
the blood froze in my veins... <BR>
This one was female and reeked of cheap champagne.</FONT></FONT></B></P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P><B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=+1>I screamed bloody murder
and begged for my life, <BR>
Then thinking quickly said &quot;Spare me, take my wife!&quot;.</FONT></FONT></B></P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P><B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=+1>Xylina did smile and
then said to me, <BR>
&quot;Forget that inn tramp who can't PvP&quot;.</FONT></FONT></B></P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P><B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=+1>I watched in dejection
as she let my wife go, <BR>
and silently cursed the luck of that 'hoe.</FONT></FONT></B></P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P><B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=+1>It was just at that moment
my son interrupted us, <BR>
He was wearing my wife's panties and looking sexually ambiguous.</FONT></FONT></B></P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P><B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=+1>My cock grew hard on
seeing his erection, <BR>
and I nearly died watching Xylina inspect him.</FONT></FONT></B></P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P><B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=+1>Her eyes they did widen
as she looked us over,<BR>
I'd done this before, but never this sober.</FONT></FONT></B></P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P><B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=+1>I cringed inwardly, then
decided oh well,<BR>
fucking my son beats burning in hell.</FONT></FONT></B></P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P><B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=+1>But homosexual incest
turned out to be <BR>
just the beginning of Xylina's sick fantasy.</FONT></FONT></B></P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P><B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=+1>I felt so exposed with
my skin peeled away, <BR>
to the witch goddess I finally did pray.</FONT></FONT></B></P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P><B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=+1>My prayers went unanswered,
or did they? I thought. <BR>
She said she would fuck me, but for some reason I fought. </FONT></FONT></B></P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P><B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=+1>I managed to speak, with
my throat in her hand, <BR>
&quot;I don't fear you witch, you can't rape a man!&quot;</FONT></FONT></B></P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P><B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=+1>It was then that I learned
I'd be raped in short order, <BR>
Rigermortis was the object of this game she called &quot;Coroner&quot;.</FONT></FONT></B></P></CENTER>
