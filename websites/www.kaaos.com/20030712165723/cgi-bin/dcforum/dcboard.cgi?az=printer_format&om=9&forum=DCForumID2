<blockquote><font color="red">Pale, blue moonlight filtered into the small chamber from the cross-styled window craved from the towers features. It’s luminescent shafts of light caused the women’s luxurious black tresses to glisten under its almost primordial gaze. Breathing, heavy, laboring, rhythmically echoed of the cold, corpse cold stone wall’s that made up the structures Spartan interior. Movement, the women & her child weren’t alone within their secluded sanctuary. A cloaked figure stalked through a shadow momentarily obscuring the column of light caressing the lady’s pale, sweat streaked form. The breathing stopped with hiss, as if trying to take back those accursed sounds, those laboring heaves which helped the pain go away, brief respite of what was to come she knew.<BR> <BR>The apparition approached the plush velvet bed, booted heels clicking sharply against the sanitized floor. It reached down, the young girl shrank away, enchanting brown eyes widening in terror & recognition, a sharp gasp escaped her flaking lips.   “You…Called my presence” the creature rasped, its arm sweeping down her generous form to her swollen belly. “Please, have mercy” she whimpered. From beneath the folds of the cowl adorning the abomination, the women for a moment could’ve sworn she heard a hint of laughter, old & an unclean. “Mercy? Heyria, your succulent form, it’s ripe. Tribute is due and I, I have a hunger to satiate”.  The pallid women’s body shuddered, hope, that precious component to mortal sanity slowly drained out her brown orbs and she began to sob, softly at first then as she lost what composure she had left- more and more violently till her body was racked by her spiritual and physical anguish. “You, hurt. Let me, let me take away your pain child.” It’s sibilant words were no sooner spoken then it’s hand, gnarled and yellowed with untold millennia’s of existence bearing down upon it swept back the velvet sheets that hid what little remained of the women’s modesty. <P>“No! Please spare me and… My child” she pleaded, trembling hands grasping the tattered hem of the creatures cloak in desperation. A futile gesture, a mortal gesture that the figure had grown accustomed too, in the end, all these bitch’s whined about their fate. Hatred, void, blood spouting, bones cracking, a music that would drive most men mad filled the reapers senses as he drove his fist up into her soft recesses, moist blood engorged tissue tearing and parting like water before a child’s pebble, farther and farther into her body. The women convulsed, a scream rending itself apart from her lungs, already tortured and strained from her pre-birth exertions, tanned back arching in agony and also in what must’ve been a grotesque candle of pleasure. Fluid, a sticky substance, flesh-developing flesh. The filth encrusted talons closed over the baby’s fragile skull in a vice-like gripe and YANKED. The stricken women could only release an animal resembling grunt, all air long vacated from her violently heaving bosom.<P>First the hand, then the child’s head exploded forth from the young girl’s vagina in a brilliant scarlet fountain of gore and amniotic fluid, blood, copious amounts of the precious sanguine fluid quickly began to darken the bed’s fine linen.  The women’s head tossed in back in forth in horror and inhuman suffering, mouth agape in her attempts to expel any oxygen left in her body- As if trying to sever her own life from this nightmare which she’d fallen into. “Hush girl, your child, your pain has been cleansed” the beast grated, dropping the quivering mass of flesh onto the floor with a wet –pathetic- splat onto the frigid stone floor. “Don’t despair, the peace you sought for is minutes away. Compose yourself, for I’ll be awaiting your soul in the lands beneath, in depths of my private chambers”. With that last, macabre promise, it went back, back to the shadows from whence it came leaving the room, leaving the moonlight, leaving the cooling, tiny body, and leaving the now still black tresses for the coming morning light.<P>Happy Valentines.<BR>Tz’Vaot</font> <BR></blockquote><hr><b><font size=2>Table of contents</font></b><hr>
