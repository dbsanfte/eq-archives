<P>
The Bones of KAAOS are the corruption of the innocent and the destruction of all that is good.  That is the burning core of KAAOS.  The KAAOS gods know no restrictions and no limitations.  The guild never interferes with the personal exploits and conquests of its members through rules or any other device.  KAAOS treasures the individuality of true evil above all else.  Each member lives in a world of vile rape and murder of their own making.  Killing and destruction unite us in an orgy of apocalyptic fury.  Nothing else is necessary to bring us together.
