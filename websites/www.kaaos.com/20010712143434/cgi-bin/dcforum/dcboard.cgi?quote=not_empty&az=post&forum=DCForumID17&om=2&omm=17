I don't <BR>&gt;read the mainline EQ fan <BR>&gt;sites any more... just the <BR>&gt;specific ones.<P>My experiences with EQ Fan sites: I used to go to two fan sites for EQ: EQVault and EQ Haven. Now, Haven was a nice place, but it had lots of problems getting cutting edge information and they weren't really writing up anything interesting either. It didn't take too long for Haven to finally collapse. <P>EQVault could have been so good. It had the cutting edge information, the developers visited the Vault boards a lot. It should have been good. But god damn it, they started posting weddings. Now this might be nice for a server specific site; however, on a fucking EQ information site I do not give a damn about who is getting married to who on some server I've never been on when I have no clue who these people are that are getting married and I doubt the poster knows either. Needless to say, it didn't take more than a couple wedding announcements to force me to stop visiting that site. They could have been the site with the inside track, but they blew it.<P> edit: Forgot to put up the moral of the story. For a fan site there is a fine line between too much information and too little. The best way to hit that fine line is by posting up quality information, and only quality information, along with putting up editorials. I don't want weddings, I don't want to know what books the people at WP read. I want to know what influences those books have on the people writing stories at wolfpack. I want to see a history of the work experience that each member of Wolfpack has, kinda like what J posted up. I'd like to know what other MMORPGS or games in general that they have played so that I know what influences will be on the game. More specifically I'd like to know what they think each game did right and wrong. I'd like to see you write an article on why it should be important to maintain diplomatic relationships in Shadowbane. When they give you info to post, I don't just want the same press release that everyone else gets, I want to see an analysis of it: the good, the bad, and the interesting. <P>If you can do that, then you've got another subscriber.<P><P>/edit<P>&gt;(Let me spell this one out <BR>&gt;for the unenlightened...
