#1 No you could not because KAAOS would never been in a position like that.

#2 It is entertainment to me. Rather than watch reality shows I entertain myself by reading your posts. It is similar to the Sunday comics.

#3 Not true. There is a special brand of person that simply does not realize how outmatched they are or what people really think of them. It is this special brand that will go to the grave proclaiming their "victories".

#4 Hmmm. Damn, I think I might have to agree with you on this one. 

#5 This statement makes no sense, but do not worry. I have come to expect it. No need to try and explain.

#6 We also pass judgment on all KAAOSers as well. Just ask Azmo what he thinks about his guildmates sometime :>

#7 GodS, plural not singular.

#8 and #9 are issues you need to work out with the person you are referring to.

#10 In the general sense yes but a true leader inspires by their actions and words.

#11 You do not lack communication skills, your just not very good at communicating with the majority of people that read these forums. I am sure in the proper surroundings, say kindercare, you would do just fine :>

#12 Could you back up this statement with some sort of proof? Or are we just supposed to take your word for it on this matter? I guarantee you most of the people around here have full lives.
