I've never looked at the gi-normous list of playable races, classes and disciplines and thought, "You know, Wolfpack needs to be concerned about each and every possible combination here, to make sure each one has a role." :)

I know that's a reduction of what you meant, so let's get serious. Yes, Shadowbane is meant to facilitate PvP, but that's not the only thing Wolfpack's ever wanted. They want characters that can fly, they want lumbering monster-characters, they want characters with built-in horse's asses (I gather Warden's got some Equus fetish or something, but I'm not going there.)

This is of course going to make the level playing field difficult to attain, but more than that, even if it /is/ attained at one level or another (say, if we ever figure out which characters can go one on one in a reasonably fair bout,) how can players ever be expected to figure that out? How can it not take tons of trial and error to figure out what happens when some random member of a unit turns into a werebear, or an elf whips out a second sword and gets Blade Weaver on your ass, or when a wild-eyed half-giant suddenly sprouts wings of fire and screeches down upon your head?

I'm not saying that all the uncertainty is a good thing, nor am I looking forward to dying a lot. But I don't necessarily see it as a problem, given that most players will never be able to figure out PvP on any level but the most rudimentary, and no matter who wins, history can still be written by the losers.

Shadowbane will certainly be the most chaotic in its first year, because people won't know what they're doing. But that's the time people will remember the most. That's what you'll tell your grandkids about.
