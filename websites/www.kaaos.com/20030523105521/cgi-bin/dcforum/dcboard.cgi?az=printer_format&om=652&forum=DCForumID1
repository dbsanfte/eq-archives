Until I get some answers and a free trial, I will  decide about investing time with buying it and investing time to play it.

I doubt it will come until sometime after we go to open Beta 3.

I know what you mean by that. You may want a very elite team on your side or you may want a challenge. But I think KAAOS might not want to be in another mass ganking type of senseless rp like Ultima. It is the 1000 new players that might cheapen the experiance with numbers instead of quality. If the designers make the pvp worth playing and encourage random pking then KAAOS might play it.<P> KAAOS might respond to your questions if I start making fun of them for the way they want to play. They have to be the center of attention if they do start playing SWG. Or at least have good sound with death and carnage.

Mason if you are looking for one answer on this you probably are going to be disappointed. Everybody here has their own set of tastes and we are not a typical guild that does happy feely things because we are a family. I can only answer for myself but I think I will probably be close to the consensus. I will not play SWG simply because it is not a fantasy related RPG. That really is as simple as it gets. I do not know anything about the game as it was never my intention to even consider it. I do not read science fiction novels, I RARELY buy science fiction games (Space Empires IV is one of my exceptions here) and I will not pay money to play a science fiction game no matter what is based on. It has no appeal to me. About as close as KAAOS ever came to playing any science fiction game with any sort of regularity was the turn based game Solaria (it was one of those X turns per day games that originated on BBSs in the mid to late 80's) which we screwed around with for a few months back in 1996. That's about all the info I, myself, can give you on this topic.<P>SangDraxx<BR>KAAOS<BR>The Serpent Lord<P><BR>

SWG is a game made to make you feel like being in a Star Wars movie. You can precast or key in what you want to do ahead of time when doing pvp. The game designers promise pod racing in the game later on so it will have a game within a game. You can be a bounty hunter, smuggler, animal tamer, fighter, mage and so forth just like Ultima Online. <P>There is just as much lore in Star Wars as there is in any other game. The game masters will be special characters like Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker.<P>But like SangDraxx just wrote, they are not your typical family of members that feel devoted with trying every new RPG that comes out.

While SWG may be “fantasy” it is sci-fi and I personally do not classify sci-fi with high fantasy. I’m with Sang on this, SWG does not interest me at all from an RPG standpoint because it is sci-fi.<P>

Technically science fiction is fantasy, which I already stated. And Star Wars had a good mix of sci-fi related fantasy and mystical fantasy, however I still would not classify it as high fantasy. The setting means a lot for fantasy fans. I enjoy sci-fi related books, movies and games (such as FPS and RTS) but I personally am not interested in an RPG based in a sci-fi setting. <P>You know, and kind of unrelated to this topic, now that I’m thinking on the subject of sci-fi, I do remember a couple books that were a cool mix of sci-fi and more classic fantasy which I dug quite a bit when I was a kid. I haven’t read them in probably around 20 – 25 years so they may not be as good as I remember. Fantasy has come a long way since then so they probably aren’t up to par with today’s literary works. They were short books if I remember correctly though so might be worth a read if you can find a copy (I’m sure they are well out of print by now). Anyway, the books were called “Hunters of the Red Moon” and the sequel “The Survivor’s”. <P>Ahahaha, that and “Death World Trilogy” was good stuff back then. Damn that was a long time ago. <P>If you do happen to find them though, I wouldn’t expect any brilliant writing, I was easily amused when I was 10 ;p<BR>

At least Azmodion will make sense more by explaining further with reference to his idea of high fantasy. The only problem I can see with high fantasy verses sci-fiction is the lack of science related objects like a trash compactor or robot. Then there are the different types of weapons that are unique in SWG and are not dependant on mage juice to fire it. The arrows in Ultima could be outrun by horse but in SWG or PlanetSide the long range weapons can be used more effectively. The only thing that could outrun a gun would be an aircraft, but at least another aircraft could shoot an aircraft down.
