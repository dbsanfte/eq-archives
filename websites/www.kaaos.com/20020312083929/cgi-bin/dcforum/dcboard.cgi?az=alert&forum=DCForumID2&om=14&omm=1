----------------------------------------------------

	A guard charged into the chamber to greet this new intruder, sword in hand. He never knew what hit him. The first thing he noticed was the red and black lightning bolt shaped tattoos that swept down from either side of his face from above either eyebrow to almost touch a nostril at thier points. The red tattoo began to glow, accompanied by a gesture from the intruder, and the guard was violently frozen in place, his sword wrenched from his grasp by the suddenness of his stop. As the sword pinwheeled through the air, the mage gestured again, and his eyes became as black as the tattoo that swept down the right side of his face. Reaching out, the mage's hand  caught the hilt of the sword, the blade immediately burst into an eldritch black flame. As the guard began to realize what was about to happen, the blade itself began to change. The tradtional silver hue of steel as replaced by a crimson red the guard instantly recognized as the color of spilt blood. While the blade's length didn't change, it began to more resemble a 3 pronged lightning bolt. He had time to utter a small weak call for assiatance before the intruder had closed on him and with a swift upward swipe of his sword, the guard had been opened up from just above his groin to the base of his neck. He was already dead when his murderer pivoted and removed his head at the precise point where the vertical wound had reached its apex. the head bonced once before splashing into the Well. 

	Leaning over the corpse, I could feel both tattoos tingling, and the corpse began to glow a dull green. Letting instinct guide my actions, I brought my sword straight through his unbeating heart at the presise moment when the glow seemed to be the brightest..My eyes rolled into the back of my head as the guard's soul was drawn through the sword into my body, where it was consumed by an appitite I never knew was there before..It was a truly heady experience, one that defied description. My left hand started to glow slightly, acompanied by the tattoos tingling as the energy coalesed into a ball, I saw a black gunk  creep from the pores in my hand to seep into the ball. I could sense more than feel what little remained of the guard's soul inside.. "Soul excrement" I laughed as i dropped the ball, only to have it just float there for a moment before bouncing...

Once..

Twice...

The third bounce brought it to the mouth of the Well, and instead of bouncing, the ball cracked like an egg and the contents seeped into the Well. 

	"Ok,with that out of the way, I have a few moments to take a quick stock of weapons and such available to me." I found myself attired in an eccletic mix of my former selves pracitcality and style. The weave and cut of the cloth, shirt and vest of a cloth that felt like silk, but tougher then cotton (or the lighter varieties of leather for that matter, with a brace of enchantments woven in as well to give the wearer the equivilant protection of molded plate armor)  more Thorn's taste.. The vest, as well as a sturdier cloth pants that both brothers preferred and the tradtitonal calf-high riding boots, were dyed in Titokhan's preferred colors of black and red (as opposed to Thorn's royal blue and white). On a quick release latch clipped to my left hip was a mace, where I expected Stormseeker, Thorn's enchanted flail. It was longer than the standard mace, and as I inspected the weapon, I found a button where the index finger of my left hand would come to rest. pressing said button released the ball from its cradle and the chain slid down from inside the weapon's shaft to make an audile click as it locked into place. Pressing the button again recalled the chain and the ball eventually locked back into its cradle. "Chock full of surprises I am, and heaven only knows what lurks inside the travelling pouches " I note to myself, allowing a slight grin as I pat the pouch secured to my belt on my left hip slightly behind the mace/flail's clip, marveling at the inventiveness that side of my now merged  personality always had. There was an empty sword holder on the right side, and all manner of daggers were hidden throughout the ensamble. A well worn warcloak hung comfortably over my shoulders, with my primary sword's belt going through a slit custom-cut in the cloak's collar, allowing for an over the shoulder right-handed draw. The clasp that held the cloak in place happened to be Thorn's WPC pin.


	"All seems in order..While I would love to stay and further build my strength feeding on the souls of this places guards, I'm not up to a run-in with the masters of this citadel...yet. But I will leave Mohdri my calling card on my way out". Reaching into one of the pouches, I retrieve a small stone with the Drumheller family crest engraved onto it. Placing it on the ground, I cast a spell of growth on it as I weave a glamour of invisibility about myself to make my departure more feasible. When at its proper size, the stone more properly resembles a small pillar about 4 feet in height. As I depart the Citadel of KAAOS and truly re-enter the worlds of the living again, I cant help but see those wandering around as potential victims and souls to feast on after taking thier lives.
