----------------------------------------------------
The dark man stood alone atop the place called Thunderclap and laughed. Every drop of rain only served to magnify his glee a thousand times, and he drank it in like wine.
 
 This “Thunderclap” was an ancient killing ground…a golgotha, or “place of the skull”. Bleached and gaping eyes stared blankly up at him…cattle, coyotes, deer, and some vaguely recognizable as men. Below, in easier altitudes, stood trees. As the dark man peered down, he could almost make out what seemed to be scrub firs. In each skull, in each rounded, vacant eye, he saw a familiar face.  Many beings had come here to brave the tempest….to prove their worth to the gods. Turning around, he saw the crumpled form of one called “Mothball”. With softened and gentle tread, the dark man knelt down and lifted the face of the battered corpse. Laughing in spite of himself, he began to speak, a sort of evil and decadent Hamlet, addressing the skull of of a man he knew well. “Your time has not passed yet, old friend”.  As he spoke this, yellow eyes at the bottom of the hill narrowed. Standing knee deep in the mud and silt, another challenger stood. Had he overheard correctly? He knew damn well that Judas had not ever known anyone as a friend.

 Picking up a shard of splintered bone, the dark man stood and plunged  it deep into his neck. Withdrawing it, he exulted in the pain..in the sheer sensual delight of the bloodletting.  True, his skin had seemed a bit flush…almost engorged. It was wondered if  he had not only butchered his latest enemy, but had consumed much of his blood as well. As the red geyser intermingled with the pouring rain, the dark man  bent his sleek head to Mothball’s ear. Opening his mouth as if to whisper a secret to a compatriot, he relaxed….and exhaled.  A torrent of black blood spewing from within him, the dark man did not cease until the body was covered in a blanket of bile. Dark chunks of unimaginable things protruded at odd angles..appearing suspiciously like fingers and flesh. Unclean nails extended to the chin of his victim, and opened his mouth.  The dark man stood triumphant…wind, rain and lightning flashing all around him, as a flood of redness spurted from the gaping hole in his neck. Amidst all this, the corpse at his feet buckled…coughed…and shuddered to life. As he observed from the gully, Spud overheard yet another comment..one which chilled him to the bone.

                                 “Come back to me Mothball…I am not done with you yet.”

The storm still raged on…and yet more observers now stood. Mouths agape in unspoken revision and horror, they watched the barely living body hoisted into the air. Slick with excrement and gore, a rough cross had been erected on the hill, and for the tenth time that night, Mothball had been strung up upon it. 
 Screaming in agony and whining for mercy, the pitiful fool felt the metal nails ripping through his hands and feet. Extending every effort, he raised his matted head and gazed down upon  he who the crowd had begun calling  “The Dark Man”. Attempting to moisten his bloody lips with a tongue which would not obey him, he opened his mouth..but fell silent. The dark man, laughing maniacally through the weak display, caught his breath for a moment and spoke.
 “Blame not me, my dear friend, my gentle companion. You chose this path and knew it lead through me. Curse your god for abandoning you to another. When you reach your afterlife, I beg of you to give your worthless deity a message for me. Tell him I am coming.”
With that, the dark man spread his arms wide, as if beseeching the storm. Muttering amongst themselves, the observers glanced skyward. Flowing swiftly into view, a black cloud was gathering  overhead.
“Gods…this creature commands not only the dead, but the elements as well?”
The crowd bade the speaker to remain silent, praying that the dark man’s attention would not be diverted to them.  Spud stood apart, arms folded. Only he paid no notion to the seeming power of the dark man. “Look”, he pointed out. “The cloud is made up of birds..tis just a flock of birds”.  As a horrible scream erupted from the cross, Spud realized he had been correct. The dark man had called forth vultures. “Fuck your god!” came the victory cry from the hilltop, and the crowd stood still.

 Judas wiped gore from his mouth, and took  notice of his observers. Perched regally on his shoulders, two vultures preened and fought over a scrap of bloody flesh. Two more had fled…gone to be ashamed for the rest of their lives. They had traveled together for days…all believing themselves worthy of immortality. Having arrived to Thunderclap at last, the remaining few surveyed Judas with little more than disdain. As every member of their group fell, Judas grew stronger…As every storm struck and every bolt of lightning fell, he seemed to revel in it. Standing now..so close to their destination, he seemed magnanimous…overjoyed. And true, he seemed to call the elements at his will. None of these things bothered the survivors so much as what they now observed. This self styled “god of the pit” bringing a weakling to life over and over again, only to butcher him. Was this the fate that awaited them all? None of that mattered now, it seemed. For as they raised their bleary heads, the storm cleared..and the vultures departed. The dark man stood before them. 

Coated with a myriad of tissues, Judas smiled. Wiping bits of lung and bone from his coat, he beckoned to them and smiled.
“Dreadful news my pets…it seems Mothball wont be joining us for the rest of the trip after all. Well, not all of Mothball.  It seems he wasn’t entirely ripe yet.”
 As dawn broke over the hills, the shadow of the dark man loomed ever larger. Surveying the terrain with unrestrained malevolence, he turned again and spoke.
“Show us evil, they said. Show us if godhood is within you, and approach us if you dare”.  With bloody sharpened teeth, the dark man made them bear witness to a gory smile none would ever forget.

                           “I’m going to show them evil such as they have never seen.”
