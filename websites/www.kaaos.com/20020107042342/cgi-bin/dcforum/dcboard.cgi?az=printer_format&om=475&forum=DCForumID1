<blockquote>Yea yea... I have to vent a little, no where else to do it, no one else has a clue about how it used to be.<P>I bought pool of radiance, I was excited, I dreamt of others... of Bits of Moander, hell even Draconians spitting at me. Of days past, my C-128 and some slow ass 16 bit graphics, 1988, a pissed of girlfriend and me an a bud hunkered around a dumb ass computor game, an island in the middle of a river, throw a rock... walk through. I was excited.<P>I loaded it up and jumped right in, fuck no I didn't read the book it couldn't be that different, I mean D&D rules are D&D rules, right? I bought the expensive version, pinned the map on the backdrop behind the pc, rolled the dice a couple of times and tossed em in the drawer with the multitudes of others, it was loading. I rolled up some charaters... er, stat modified some chraracters, why the fuck would they give you dice and not let the game random roll your characters? I didn't care.... A fighter, a cleric, a mage, and a paladin... all ready to roll, hell I even remembered thier names from 1988, Vincent, Buffy (yea... who'da known)Slayer, and Tank. The game was loaded, I was in... cool, new twist, I'm lost in the ruins of Myth Drannor, orcs directly ahead looting the corpse of those I seek, trying to rescue Phlan from the hands of evil once again. Mage is first... no spells, ack. Cleric is next he gets a swing in, fighter drops em in one shot... in turned based combat yeeeeaaaaaa. I grab a beer, begin to wander, kill some shit and find a place to rest. No grim, wtf? My mage can't cast any spells? Where the hell is my THACO? Why is my god damn armor 18? Ohh no, I pick up the book and begin to read......<P>Charisma determines how many spells and of what level spells you can cast? Charisma determines chance of turning undead? Armor is figured completely fucking backwards? die roll + modifiers must equal armor to gain a hit and I guess what ever the fuck is left over is the damage? I could go on, but why bother.<P>The game is cool, I like the turn based combat once I got it sped up a little (all this real time shit has seemed to make me a little impatient, beer helps though). The graphics will do, my rolls still suck but at least they are rolls, the fe is gonna work I guess, looks like the game will probably be a lot of fun in the long run. All I want to know is, Who, who fucked up the D&D rules so badly? <P>Abs<P>-oh, and nice itty worship there guys. If the world can count on anyone keeping the memories alive I guess it would have to be thier biggest fans-</blockquote><hr><b><font size=2>Table of contents</font></b><hr>

ABs, I hope you downlaoded all the patches, cause I had to throw that fucking game away.  Its redundant, its boring, and it was BUG ridden!<P>Go read the pissed off people screaming at Ubisoft for having bugs in the game that deleted whole harddrives.  Great graphics, killer concept, gay game.<P><BR>Ku

Abs, better get used to 3e if you wanna play NWN, cause them rules are the rules that are being incorporated.<P>I rather like the rules meself, once you get used to them they kinda make sense.<P>btw, DOWNLOAD them patches.  Especially the 1.1 Installer/Uninstaller.<P>~Met

Yeah I had read about the bug problems in a review somewhere. UBIsoft said that they weren't going to rerelease it but rather fix problems in an upcoming edition or some shit like that.<P><BR>SangDraxx<BR>KAAOS<BR>The Serpent Lord<P><BR>
