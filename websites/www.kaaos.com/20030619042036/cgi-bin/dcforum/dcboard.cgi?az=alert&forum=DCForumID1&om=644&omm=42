LOl, oh shit, I almost forgot about King Bookie, I was amazed that it actually worked out. And I got Rich!!! Heh!

Azmo, no disresect taken, my reputation did preceed me, I'll be the first to admit, well, ok, many years after, I was no where near the skill level of any other person who had as many "wins" under my belt. Yet I was consistantly in the top 15, more usually in the top 10, on the ladder, and, with my partner Myst, on the top 5 in doubles. Yeah, Myst carried me heavily in that ordeal, and there was always 1 other ITB pair ahead of us...but my point is, incredible skill and careful planning and attention was'nt always a match for a very good understanding of each spell, some fair NPC mani, and luck. 

Hell, I was lucky if I got within 2 rounds of my globe going down, let alone others..'cept when it REALLY mattered (Ladder,War, Etc.). Plus I used to drink a whole shitload back then...that's probably why Mal was able to drive me so nuts!

Anyway, I won't ramble too much more..as I said, I'll acknowledge as a small group, ARK was among the cream of the crop, for some period, the best. And Kpuss<g>, they were the only real competition ITB had usually. It was the best on-line gaming rivalry that I've ever seen, damn, sometimes it got insanely out of hand!

Anyway, 'nuff's said. Good to see you'll are still around. 

Skorp

PS - aside from your 3 mentioned ITB's worht a shit in PVP, lets not forget Myst, Force, Master, Faust (that bastard<g>), and Cormyr. All ITB Ladder champions. So there!!!
