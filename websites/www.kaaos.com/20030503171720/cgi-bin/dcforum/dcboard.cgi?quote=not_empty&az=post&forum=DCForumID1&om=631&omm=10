         <blockquote>
         There are a lot of people in this guild with an opinion on what makes for a good PvP game. I didn’t respond because I do not believe you are capable of understanding anything outside your own little opinions. You are blind. In addition to being blind you appear to be deaf, dumb and stupid. I’m sure many others haven’t responded for the same reason, they may as well just talk to a wall.<P>However, this is an interesting topic. I’m going to reply but not for your benefit because I do not believe you will understand what I am saying. It would be lost solely on you. I am replying for my own benefit, because reflection on topics such as these interest me, and for the benefit of other readers who may find this topic interesting. <P>Before I get to “what makes a good PvP game” I’m going to go into a little bit about why PvP is essential for the RPG environment....<P>Most people gaming today do not understand the true appeal of RPG PvP. Nor do they understand what is supposed to make it unique. This is due to the fact that most gamers today are post AD&D pen and paper popularity and post oNWN. They simply have never experienced it so how could they know? To understand the attraction, for many, of RPG PvP you really must experience it first hand.<P>RPG PvP is different than FPS type combat for a very distinct reason. RPG’s are about character, FPS is simply about fraging. Now, some people like fragging and some people like RPG’s. The entertainment value of each is subjective to the individual. I am partial to RPG’s so this is where my perspective stems from.<P>So from that standpoint, what makes RPG combat entertaining? I feel that RP is what really makes RPG combat entertaining (and unique from FPS, among other genres). RP doesn’t have to include a lot of thee’s and thou’s. RP is about fantasy, assuming a role created by your imagination. This is much easier for the individual in a solo type format. It’s when you add the MMO that it becomes much more difficult. You see, although RP is about fantasy this fantasy needs to be based on certain truths. In a solo format that truth is whatever the individual makes it. However, in an MMO format, truth is created by the masses. Your imagination is limited to what is believable by the masses. If you do not stay within these truths then your experience and the experience of others around you will be dulled to the point of inanity.<P>For example, say you want to be a super hero. Sounds kind of cool right? You, the SUPERHERO! You will RP a SUPERHERO! SUPERHERO GEO TO THE RESCUE! But, what is a superhero? A Superhero is a figure endowed with superhuman powers. Well, what is “superhuman”? Superhuman is basically “beyond ordinary”. <P>So now you are RPing a superhero in a forum you share with 10,000 other people who also are acting out a role. Guess what those 10,000 other people want to be......you guessed it, SUPERHEROES! So now you and 10,000 other people are running around acting out being superheroes. That would make you.....well....kind of.....ordinary. So the truth that you and the masses have created is that superheroes are actually not superheroes at all. <BR>Which “fantasy” world would you rather act out being a superhero in. One where everyone is a superhero so that when you walk into the room posing with your fists on your hips and say “I am GEO, faster than a speeding bullet, stronger than a locomotive, able to leap tall buildings in a single bound!” and everyone replies “shut up wuss”? Or would you rather act out a superhero in an environment where the mere sight of you makes lesser men’s knees tremble in fear, awe or respect (whatever be your RP flavor)?<P>The great thing about fantasy environments is that the people who enjoy them are very passionate about fantasy. The core fantasy fans realize there has to be peons, there has to be peasants, there has to be toothless whores. Without these, fantastic people and fantastic feats are not fantastic at all. And when that happens, your fantasy world just looks like an extension of real life rather than a separate world entirely. Nobody wants to be the piss boy but this core will carry the bucket if they have to, if they are forced to......if the truth is that they truly ARE the piss boy. They will do it because they enjoy fantasy and they want to be a part of the fantasy environment even if they must do it as the piss boy. Even as the piss boy they will be a part of the environment, they will witness fantastic people and fantastic feats. <P>So how do you make one realize that they are the piss boy? You must create that truth. This is what is so unique about RPG PvP. This is why MMORPG’s without PvP will NEVER be a good fantasy experience. A GOOD PvP system can and will create a truth for the masses that they must and will respect. Once this foundation of truth is laid RPG can and will flourish, without it...............Well, it’s just one big toilet bowl.<P>So now we get to the topic of “what makes a good PvP game”. Aside from “it must be entertaining” because that is a given....<P>PvP has to create a truth. “I am a superhero”. People must believe that you are “beyond ordinary” for that “claim” to have any sort of truth (or power, or weight, or what-have-you). PvP must be skill based in so much that if player A is better than player B, player A is simply better than player B. Don’t get me wrong, there doesn’t have to be ONE top dog but there needs to be, for lack of a better word, social classes of players. <P> “Character class” (diversity or lack thereof), “skills”, “special weapons”, etc. are all frosting. Without the cake, frosting is just a blob of sugared shit. Some people like cake without frosting and others like cake with frosting. Whichever you prefer is fine and there should be different games that appeal to different palates but regardless, THERE HAS TO BE A DAMN CAKE. There is not one MMORPG out there right now that is a cake, they are all just big blobs of sugared shit......<P>Unfortunately that’s all the time I have for right now. I’ll continue this a bit later and I’ll get more into specifics about some of the requirements for a good PvP system.<P>Azmodion<BR>KAAOS
