         <blockquote>
         <P><BR>	Deep within the KAAOS citidel in the Lavastorm mountains lies the Well of Souls.. where the victims of the gods of KAAOS's souls are placed for eternal torture and for the entertainment of KAAOS. In the Well's existance, there have only been a handful of times where a soul found the wherewithall to escape back into the realms of the living..and what is to follow is one of those rare occasions..<P>	Much like the interdimensional limbo known as the Abyss (where the traditional laws of physics, ect. generally dont apply), each soul in the well appears to each other the way they were last seen in life, minus the physicality of substance. Somehow, among the eternal confusion of the countless souls gathered by KAAOS over the years intermingling in sorrow and eternal pain, 2 unique, yet very similar souls have found each other again and have seperated themselves to an extent from the insanity. <P>	 "Man, we outdid ourselves this time Tito..This may be one mess we might not be able to get out of. We're dead fer cryin out loud...Killed by a friggin novice to boot..OK, he may have had my powers, and a fair share of my memories, but he literally had no practice in using those abilities..." <P>	"And to think everyone considers me the dark, brooding one.. This isnt you Thorn, isnt you at all..There may be a way.."<P>	"A way out of here? The only way even one of us might get out is...Tito, you aren't suggesting what I think you're suggesting...are you? <P>	"Thorn, think about how we ended up here... Mohdri used 'your' power against you. But we both know that had you were at full power, Innorruk never would have gotten that portion of it in the first place. And unless you reclaim what is rightfully yours, neither of us will get out of here and we'll rot for eternity like these poor souls. Damnit Thorn, without that piece of your soul that you willingly gave to me that day.. I wouldnt be here, our home would've been destroyed, and I'm not sure you would have been the same afterward. Only with all the pieces of your  self intact would you stand a chance against Mohdri..And its not like you're getting rid of me...every time you look in the mirror, i'll be staring back at you. It just won't be the way you've gotten used to over the years." <P>(Note for those unfamiliar with the characters:: in the first story I wrote, must be close to 5 years ago now, Thorn's original homeland before he came to Neverwinter was under attack by those he had defeated before his arrivial in the Sword Coast. To protect his home and those who depended on him for thier defense, he used a variation of the M:Tg spell Clone, imparted this being with a piece of his soul and close to 1/2 his power. That's why I've always referred to them as more then twins.)<P>	"I understand Tito..and you're right..it is the only chance. Let's do it."<P>	Slowly, mythodically, Thorn began a singsong mantra what was very much unlike the magicks and enchantments most who practiced the arts arcane on Norrath understood, and ever so slowly Thorn and Titokhan's souls began to merge. In his castle in the Plane of Hate, Innorruk heard the mantra and smiled. 'It's about time those two figured it out' the Prince of Hate sneered as the mantra's pace slowly began to build. 'I thought I could control the little bastrard by only partially corrupting the brewmasters soul as i bound him to Mohdri. But I underestimated the full scope of the power i had bound to him, especially when he obtained the rest of it. What I didnt tell him was he didnt know all there was to know about the Drumheller brothers, even though Thorn's soul was bound to him.' Within a few short minutes, the mantra was heard throughout the dimensional ether, where in the limbo known as the Abyss, the corpses of both Thorn and Titokhan Drumheller and thier weapons of choice vanished into mist. Meanwhile an ominous set of stormclouds began to build over the KAAOS Citadel as well as an eerie red light could be seen eminating from the Well of Souls by the slaves with not enough sense to wander past the eternally damned room that housed the well. <P>	The mantra came to an abrupt end at the same time a massive bolt of lightning surged from the stormclouds and struck at the Citadel with enough force that should have reduced even such a place as that to smoldering stone, though the impact was felt throughout Norrath. When the smoke cleared, the citadel was merely scorched, but it was not the bolt's intended target, it was something inside the citadel. Roaming the Western Commonlands of Freeport, Mohdri was in the mist of a pitched battle with a small horde of critters. And while he couldn't place the mantra, at the precise moment the lightning bolt struck the citadel, he doubled over in pain, clutching at his face as it felt like it was on fire. As quickly as the pain had come though, it vanished just as suddenly. It proved but a momentary distraction, as he proceeded to dispatch the critters. But as he healed his wounds and attempted to meditate to regain the mana spent in the battle, he couldn't maintain his concentration as ringing, manicial laughter filled his mind in an eerily familiar voice. It was a voice he was sure he knew from somewhere, so Instead of continuing his hunting, he used what little mana he had left to cast a gate to return to the Citadel.<P>    Said laughter could also be heard ringing throughout the Citadel as a very corporeal hand reached up from the Well's depths to grab for purchase at the top of the Well. In short order, the figure had fully emerged. He was of average height and build for someone who appeared to be in his late twenties, though as always, appearances are decieving. <P>

         <blockquote>
         <BR>	A guard charged into the chamber to greet this new intruder, sword in hand. He never knew what hit him. The first thing he noticed was the red and black lightning bolt shaped tattoos that swept down from either side of his face from above either eyebrow to almost touch a nostril at thier points. The red tattoo began to glow, accompanied by a gesture from the intruder, and the guard was violently frozen in place, his sword wrenched from his grasp by the suddenness of his stop. As the sword pinwheeled through the air, the mage gestured again, and his eyes became as black as the tattoo that swept down the right side of his face. Reaching out, the mage's hand  caught the hilt of the sword, the blade immediately burst into an eldritch black flame. As the guard began to realize what was about to happen, the blade itself began to change. The tradtional silver hue of steel as replaced by a crimson red the guard instantly recognized as the color of spilt blood. While the blade's length didn't change, it began to more resemble a 3 pronged lightning bolt. He had time to utter a small weak call for assiatance before the intruder had closed on him and with a swift upward swipe of his sword, the guard had been opened up from just above his groin to the base of his neck. He was already dead when his murderer pivoted and removed his head at the precise point where the vertical wound had reached its apex. the head bonced once before splashing into the Well. <P>	Leaning over the corpse, I could feel both tattoos tingling, and the corpse began to glow a dull green. Letting instinct guide my actions, I brought my sword straight through his unbeating heart at the presise moment when the glow seemed to be the brightest..My eyes rolled into the back of my head as the guard's soul was drawn through the sword into my body, where it was consumed by an appitite I never knew was there before..It was a truly heady experience, one that defied description. My left hand started to glow slightly, acompanied by the tattoos tingling as the energy coalesed into a ball, I saw a black gunk  creep from the pores in my hand to seep into the ball. I could sense more than feel what little remained of the guard's soul inside.. "Soul excrement" I laughed as i dropped the ball, only to have it just float there for a moment before bouncing...<P>Once..<P>Twice...<P>The third bounce brought it to the mouth of the Well, and instead of bouncing, the ball cracked like an egg and the contents seeped into the Well. <P>	"Ok,with that out of the way, I have a few moments to take a quick stock of weapons and such available to me." I found myself attired in an eccletic mix of my former selves pracitcality and style. The weave and cut of the cloth, shirt and vest of a cloth that felt like silk, but tougher then cotton (or the lighter varieties of leather for that matter, with a brace of enchantments woven in as well to give the wearer the equivilant protection of molded plate armor)  more Thorn's taste.. The vest, as well as a sturdier cloth pants that both brothers preferred and the tradtitonal calf-high riding boots, were dyed in Titokhan's preferred colors of black and red (as opposed to Thorn's royal blue and white). On a quick release latch clipped to my left hip was a mace, where I expected Stormseeker, Thorn's enchanted flail. It was longer than the standard mace, and as I inspected the weapon, I found a button where the index finger of my left hand would come to rest. pressing said button released the ball from its cradle and the chain slid down from inside the weapon's shaft to make an audile click as it locked into place. Pressing the button again recalled the chain and the ball eventually locked back into its cradle. "Chock full of surprises I am, and heaven only knows what lurks inside the travelling pouches " I note to myself, allowing a slight grin as I pat the pouch secured to my belt on my left hip slightly behind the mace/flail's clip, marveling at the inventiveness that side of my now merged  personality always had. There was an empty sword holder on the right side, and all manner of daggers were hidden throughout the ensamble. A well worn warcloak hung comfortably over my shoulders, with my primary sword's belt going through a slit custom-cut in the cloak's collar, allowing for an over the shoulder right-handed draw. The clasp that held the cloak in place happened to be Thorn's WPC pin.<P><BR>	"All seems in order..While I would love to stay and further build my strength feeding on the souls of this places guards, I'm not up to a run-in with the masters of this citadel...yet. But I will leave Mohdri my calling card on my way out". Reaching into one of the pouches, I retrieve a small stone with the Drumheller family crest engraved onto it. Placing it on the ground, I cast a spell of growth on it as I weave a glamour of invisibility about myself to make my departure more feasible. When at its proper size, the stone more properly resembles a small pillar about 4 feet in height. As I depart the Citadel of KAAOS and truly re-enter the worlds of the living again, I cant help but see those wandering around as potential victims and souls to feast on after taking thier lives.
