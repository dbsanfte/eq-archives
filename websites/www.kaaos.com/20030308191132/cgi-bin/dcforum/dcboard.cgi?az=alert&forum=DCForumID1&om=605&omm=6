How can I fully understand that typical one liner coming from a guy who can only say I am a loser and not give real quality reasons.

I was right in saying that a few people in a clan can’t take on the world of Shadowbane which is the reason to play. (feel sorry for the people who do not want to build anything but weapons of mass destruction)

I was right that a team of misfits bent on killing newbies all day can only lead to wasting time. Also, they have nothing to lose so why bother?

I was right in trying to convince people of chaos that evil serves no purpose but to be a total retard and act as if no one else knows how to play a game which is including completion of the full circle or role play from newbie to helper or building a new clan.

Oh I know chaos has no rules but why go out of your way to make someone look or seem like a loser since it is only a game to be you’re your entertainment for the time your on. You feel like it is a mutation to something better but I know it is a returning to your own desires which is weak. 

Oh no you may say? The strong will be the guys who play to get from A to B in a progressive mode. The weak one will try to take and take without giving a cent back. The reason why you can’t make anything in Shadowbane is because you’re too greedy and will only spend cash on weapons.

You can't give any reasons to start out this thred and you will never get it over with since you have no backbone to start with.
