<blockquote>As night sets in I hear the whisper of a deep heavy song playing from within the depths of the forest.  <P>The sweet melody draws me nearer, as I get closer I can feel the bass pulsating, pounding...  erupting my desires.  Oh such erotic sounds.<P>...... my clothes almost seem to fall away from me, I am left naked listening to the pounding, getting ever more excited. All thought of death, blood, and riches disappear.....<P>*Bang, Boom, Boom, Boom Bang, Zip Zip, Bang*<P>I am completely naked amongst the larks and nightengales.  The music has taken control of me.<P>I pull out my glow sticks and begin to sway them to the music making intricate patterns appear in the mist...<P>"Dance you li'l faggot, DANCE!" keeps running through my head<P>TBC...<BR>---------<BR>Kibby<CC><BR>Fear that!</blockquote><hr><b><font size=2>Table of contents</font></b><hr>
