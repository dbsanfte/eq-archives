<blockquote>Hello, I tried to e-mail so here is my reason I would like to join your Shadowbane guild.<P> I enjoyed the content of the web site alot.<P>A little about me:<BR>Im over 18 years of age being 29yrs old. And I have played all of the<BR>stages in Ultima. Playing all the Dungions, helping others, slaughtered multiple players( PvPPP). Able to find a style and character worth my time and effort.<P>Playing an honest game and not running off the screen, haha!!! I am dependable so I will never lie about my abilities. I know that even a new guy has a great chance of being one of the best, so I am friends with all. All guilds and players should be respected as a person and role in the game (RPG) and never be made to look small since the tides change everyday.</blockquote><hr><b><font size=2>Table of contents</font></b><hr>

I think your trying to change the subject. Role playing is about playing. True real life does have us make a choice of what games we all can play. It is the choice of escape with taking the stress out of life for that moment of play. Some people may get stress from playing. If that is the case maybe the game should not be played. Of course being a newbie brings alot more stress than being a veteran of the game. The other two posts that I made showed why the guildmaster and other members should use time in deciding to accept me in as a trial member. The email address proxy server did not work right.

Trying to talk tough will not help out in the long run. I have shared a little info about myself and I am in no way trying to be a troll on this forum. I took an interest but lost it becouse of 4 punk guys, rofl. Killing as an orginized sport will not be so orginized if your type of selective guild keeps harsh limits and name calling. Shadowbane will not be like the other games such as Ultima where a few "selected" people with the most memorized macroes wins. It will not entirely depend on skill but will have a progressive virtual reality storyline. <P>Oh your still reading... <P>And one more detail I would like to cover, you guys need to stop the role play while you are not playing your macho games. Take it easy on yourself and make a friend or two.

This is info from the latest beta build. (What they are beta testing now)<P>The RP aspect of the game should really come to light with this new build. Already, alliances are forming based on RP and not on making a guild that contains all the various professions. But, as with all RP games, there will always be ARAC guilds. They will build their guild with the thought of "Playing to Crush" everybody else in the game....and lore be damned. The nice thing is, those are the guilds who garner the most enemies and who do not get the bonuses or FC attention that the RP guilds will get. It will balance out in the end.

I can tell who the leader of the pack is without going back to find out. Hedron must of been doing too much real life things to care about guys like me thinking I must act tough in real life to be considered as an evildoer at heart in the game. It might be 100% true that I am a goodguy. Most people who kill in games only care about the team so I understand why I am treated as such now. When the day comes to fight off you evildoers I will not feel so bad. If I turn out to be a god then maybe I will be asked to be in the guild? Would your forum members feel stupid at all or just say oh no he has 1% good inside in real life, we better not accept those people, I need a hug Hedron.

I could help you guys come up with a slogan, "This aint your parents guild, we have no rules!" <P>I can see why I can not deal with being in your guild. I know children must play too though.

I can just picture a few regulators trying to take down all of the cities in one day. Very funny indeed! Might happen at night with only guards at the city, we will just have wait to see. The last thing I would do is cry since an empire does not have to worry too much about thinning out to far. A nice pack of buildings and I will be waiting for those few chaos trying to get past our guards while groups and groups of us order guys pick and choose who goes down next. You see, a defence is much more easier than an attack. But then again I could be wrong about that since most people have lives and cant be on 24/7.

And your powerful guild and town is where? That's right, you have no guild and this one wouldn't even consider you. So where is your town? Wait, the game isn't even out of beta and I doubt that you're in the current beta and own a town. KAAOS is a guild that has proven themselves time and again that they kill their opponents. You are just another newbie with zero power predicting the downfall of KAAOS in a game that won't even be out for at least 4 more months.<P>Hell, guilds like SiN and CC aren't all that different from KAAOS. People predicted that guilds like that would fail in Shadowbane where guilds like TCE would dominate. TCE is gone and SiN/CC/a few others are doing the dominating. Why have they succeeded even with all the nay sayers predicting their doom? They're good players who have succeeded in every other game they have played because they have learned the game and adapted. KAAOS will adapt as well.<P>It's the nay sayers who spend too much time predicting the downfall of others rather than thinking about how they will win, that always end up on the bottom.<P>Mortarion<BR>god of death and decay<BR>not KAAOS, for those newbs out there

Trying to compare your guild to the ones that have shown a couple of good fights did not impress me. I said we would have to wait and see when more people began to play though. I did not say that I was in a real need to join a wolfs style of play. But I do know this, when the majority of people start to play (when SB turns gold) the walls will be made of brick. Caaos and other grief player guilds will puff and puff and will never blow down those houses.

Firstly, there are ways to break guilds other than a prime time frontal assault on their city. We have been tearing guilds apart since before there were cities to knock down, since before the so called “first generation MMORPG’s” existed (which by the way, we consider second generation). We’ve been in the business of bleeding fools like you for over 10 years now. It’s the sheep like you that make it possible, to kill a guild one would prey on the weak and the stupid.  <P>Secondly, you are nothing more than a lemming. In those 10 years we have existed we have seen countless sheep just like you with the exact same song and dance. You apply to KAAOS, get ignored first...laughed at when you continue to query...pissed on when, in lieu of crawling back under your insignificant rock, you start preaching about how KAAOS will be squashed by newb guild 20000045 in x game. It used to be funny but after the 10 billion fucks who looked just like you, smelled just like you, squealed just like you, who came before you, it just becomes old and tired. <P>We don’t deal in the weak, we don’t deal in the stupid. If there is one weak link the chain breaks. We devour our recruits because if they can’t take the punishment by their “family” how the fuck can we trust them to take the heat against our enemies? No weak links. Each KAAOSer can smell fear and weakness a mile away. If they smell it coming from another KAAOSer you bet your ass they will be there, like a pirana, to take little pieces out of them. If they draw blood the rest of the pack is attracted and a feeding frenzy begins and, believe me, once that happens there is nothing left behind. The feeding frenzy is even more fierce when it’s a KAAOSer who’s exposed their soft white underbelly than it is for our enemies. <P>A quote from the mouth of babes:<BR><i>“Trying to have this "orginized sport" while using name calling might make it hard to have quality players and players that will stay. “</i><P>We are all about quality, something a guild that invites someone to join with no prior knowledge of their ability, of their character, of their intelligence can possibly compete with. For some people it can take years to be recognized as KAAOS. We have never had a KAAOSer outright quit the guild, not in 10 years. We’ve had some retire, we’ve booted a few, but KAAOS is definitely not a revolving door. <P>The bottom line is, one cannot “become” KAAOS. You were either born KAAOS or you weren’t. And you.....are not KAAOS. <P>Azmodion<BR>Lord of Misery<BR>KAAOS God of Misfortune

LOL, this guy is hilarious. How do you KAAOSers attract these guys? I don't know if it's more impressive that this guy can type without being able to read, or that he found this site.<P>Geo, just in case you do actually have some rudimentary reading skills, I'll go over it again. KAAOS knows what they're doing and do not even find it interesting that a newbie like you comes here predicting doom for KAAOS. They also have learned nothing from you. They've known for years that the might have to adapt to Shadowbane, just like they've adapted to every other game. Just like Sin/CC/ect have adapted to Shadowbane beta. Just like Sin/CC/ect will adapt to Shadowbane release. <P>They'll avoid adapting as much as they can, but they do assume some amount of adapting. One thing that I can guarantee is that a pile of newbies will still get shredded and destroyed, no matter how big the pile is, and that includes their city. It's amazing how easy it is to turn people who don't trust each other against each other. That is the reason why the newbies always lose and always will lose, no game mechanic can stop that.<P>You would be a newbie. Enjoy dieing. But remember, your death is only a minor enjoyment.

I was told by this guild Kaaos this: There will be people that play the game that are newbies. I think that most people who play RPG will not be new. The role play adventure games have been out longer and more people will want to be on a good team, a strong team with many members. The few vets that are on large teams will teach the new guys the best way of combat in the game. The small teams will only have the advantage of a surprise attack. Then they have to scamper away before the vets come to fight ROFL!!! Other than that I see no other advantages of a small team even if they have been playing RPG for 50 years.

Members of the Kaaos guild might have to change the RPG style very soon in order to do any good becouse of your reputation as bad mouthin misplaced gods. You may feel like gods now in beta, the real game will be a much better game with many more people wanting to role play. Ultima has new rules that if you pk and get 5 counts, your other characters turn red as well. They even cut down the loot pks get to 25% lootable items ROFL. What great goals to protect these true role players. Shadowbane did the same to protect three items on all characters if they die. And if you want to kill some newbies as your pack of wolves want to do, you get such a small % of exp Muhahahahahahahahahahaha!!! So if you want to gank me your bitch ass team will be more than welcome, I won't cry.
