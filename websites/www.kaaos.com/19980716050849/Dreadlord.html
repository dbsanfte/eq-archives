 'Heh Heh!' were the only words to come from his lips, as he pulled out his 9 inch serrated dagger. Knowing that actions speak
                          louder than words he finished off his opponent and walked off with a stagger.
</p>
<p>
  Glancing back, he watched the other's blood soak into the ground and with a grin at the sight he yelled "Take it, wuss!" Already
   turning to look for another to fight, careful to not make a sound, Sir Rellik thought of hot tubs, spritzers and a certain Spiked
                                                            Boot.
</P>
<p>
  KAAOS knows no bounds in the destruction of all that is good and do not hold any barriers to those that want to join its cause.
    They proclaim themselves Gods and Goddesses over all and their arrival in your midst is always enough to give you pause.
