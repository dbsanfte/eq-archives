                                  stone than anything created by man.</font></p>

                                  a small, fire blackened door. Without breaking 
                                  stride, as the walk up to it, a finger on Hedron's 
                                  left hand twitches, and the door flies open. 
                                  They march in.</font></p>
                                <p><font size="-1">They march in.</font></p>

                                  do they march into? This one room is some kind 
                                  of twisted reality. Some kind of gross warped 
                                  joke played on the essence of life. The Main 
                                  Pit had been a sight, but this? This was painful 
                                  for Kaelith to look at. Except he couldn't NOT 
                                  look at it. There was no light in the room. 
                                  Not a shred except for what beamed in through 
                                  the doorway from the flickering torches in the 
                                  hall.</font></p>
                                <p><font size="-1">But somehow, that didn't matter. 
                                  Even without the light, the contents of this 
                                  room burned into your brain. The room echoed 
                                  with such pain and hurt that it needed no light 
                                  to push itself into your head like a branding 
                                  iron.</font></p>
                                <p><font size="-1">And no blinking of eyes, no 
                                  covering of faces, no hiding could shut it out!</font></p>
                                <p><font size="-1">It didn't seem to bother Hedron. 
                                  In fact, he didn't even seem to notice. As he 
                                  walked into the room, the Twisted Cross of the 
                                  False Prophet of KAAOS rose into the air and 
                                  beamed a dark and evil light around the room. 
                                  It silhoueted an evil sleeping form stretched 
                                  out on a blood stained table. Again without 
                                  breaking stride, Hedron's foot rose up in a 
                                  vicious kick, that slammed the table out from 
                                  under its occupant, crashing it into a wall 
                                  and splintering half of it into sawdust.</font></p>
                                <p><font size="-1">In the same moment, Hedron's 
                                  voice rang out, &quot;Malhavok, get up you sleeping

                                <p><font size="-1">This was Malhavok's Lab. Once

                                  He hung there in mid-air as though nothing had 
                                  happened. With a slow stretch, he turned and 
                                  sat up, placing his feet on the floor. Seeming 
                                  to take no notice that there was no table to 
                                  be sitting on.</font></p>

                                  up&quot;.</font></p>
                                <p><font size="-1">Malhavok let out a long, loud 
                                  laugh and took the Kaelith Meat Puppet by the 
                                  arm and dragged him to a large device that looked 
                                  like a very large, bean beag chair. It was rather 
                                  uneven shaped, but looked quite comfortable. 
                                  The only feature that made it look different 
                                  was a rather &quot;watery&quot; consitancy it 
                                  had. It looked as if you sat in it, you'd fall 
                                  right through.</font></p>
                                <p><font size="-1">Mal pushed the Meat Puppet 
                                  into the chair. Kaelith relaxed for a moment, 
                                  but suddenly the chair started to envelope him. 
                                  His body shimmered INTO the chair and his face 
                                  contorted in pain, as his molecules and being 
                                  forged itself with the chair. Arms turned rubbery, 
                                  legs became ooze and melded into the chair. 
                                  In a matter of 10 seconds, Kaelith had BECOME 
                                  the chair.</font></p>
                                <p><font size="-1">Hedron gave a smirk, from his 
                                  position a few feet away, and laughed at Mal's 
                                  little creation. A small face, contorted in 
                                  agony looked out from the chair, it's eyes pleading.</font></p>
                                <p><font size="-1">&quot;Oh, but there's more&quot; 
                                  said Malhavok, as he unceremoniously plopped 
                                  his frame onto the Kaelith Chair. A muffeled 
                                  &quot;Uuuuuurrgh!&quot; was barely audible from 
                                  the chair as Mal got comfy in his new seat. 
                                  Mal shifted in the Kaelith Chair a bit then 
                                  said, &quot;Ahhh...glad I had an extra serving 
                                  of Legion's +3 chili this evening&quot;. He 
                                  smiled at Heddie and lifted slightly off the 
                                  chair.</font></p>

                                  shouted Hedron as he dove for cover and tried 
                                  to shield himself from the forthcoming blast, 
                                  but it was too late. </font>

                                  artfully removing the heart of a KEF'er Paladin 
                                  she had captured the night before, was a mere 
                                  50 yards from Mal's Lab. The explosion shook 
                                  her from her delicate work and she slipped, 
                                  plunging the dagger deep into the bowels of 
                                  the startled KEF'er, splattering blood on her 
                                  royal Drow gown. &quot;Damn it!&quot; she shouted 
                                  as she ripped the dagger out of the KEF'ers 
                                  guts as they poured forth onto the cold floor. 
                                  She left the dead KEF'er and stormed down the 
                                  hallway to Mal's lab. Poison was in her eyes, 
                                  and inflicting pain for ruining her KEF'er, 
                                  was on her mind.</font></p>

                                  against the wall, at the HORRID stench emanating 
                                  from the bowels of Mal's Lab. &quot;Lloth preserve 
                                  me!&quot; she shouted and ran towards the HotTub

                                  the Hell Hole. They were all in mid-cast, when 
                                  the stench entered the room. They both looked 
                                  at each other for a moment, then ran screaming 
                                  for the window at the far end of the hall. One 
                                  raced the other for the window and they all 
                                  crashed through it at the same time to the blessedly 
                                  scentless moat below.</font></p>

                                  and made his way over to where his Meat Puppet 
                                  lay. His Meat Puppet was back to normal it seemed,

                                  wimpered as he approached. Malhavok was nowhere

                                  song that just would NOT leave his stupified 
                                  brain.</font></p>

                                  as a bead of sweat dripped off his nose. Rows 
                                  and rows of cases filled the place, but there 
                                  didnt seem to be a clerk about! The Meat Puppet 
                                  stood in the center of the huge drugstore and 
                                  danced about, holding his bum. &quot;Hello?&quot;, 
                                  he squeeked. No answer. &quot;Hello?!?!&quot; 
                                  He pulled himself up the counter and peered 
                                  over the top (The gods sure are tall;x) Noone. 
                                  He walked over to one of the cases and pressed 
                                  his tiny face against the glass. Inside were 
                                  nothing but boxes and boxes of Preparation H!! 
                                  &quot;Yeaaah!&quot;, he cried out and clapped 
                                  his little hands. Quickly he ran over and tugged 
                                  on the handle. It was locked! His face fell 
                                  and he jumped back. Getting a little run going, 
                                  he smacked himself off the glass. It wouldnt 
                                  break! Suddenly a fear gripped him, and he looked 
                                  about, weeping. Just then, Heddies voice filled 
                                  the Hell Hole with a great and uproarious laughter.</font></p>

                                <p><font size="-1">As the final blow was dealt, 
                                  Circe stared at the figure she had been fighting. 
                                  Throughout the entire fight she had seen an 
                                  evil in him that she had seen in no other man 
                                  she had ever come across. As she fell to the 
                                  ground a shiver went thru her body knowing exactly 
                                  what was to come.</font></p>
                                <p><font size="-1">He came closer to her and bent 
                                  down just as she hit. Out of Circe's mouth came 
                                  her true name. With an evil roar of laughter, 
                                  Hedron touched Circe's hair and became one with 
                                  her. A feeling began to go thru her body, one 
                                  that she was sure she would never recover from.</font></p>
                                <p><font size="-1">In a stunned state after being 
                                  healed, Circe headed back to the place where 
                                  she had done battle with Hedron, her master. 
                                  She no longer thought of Hedron as a mere mortal 
                                  which she had once believed him to be. She now 
                                  thought of him as her master and god.</font></p>
                                <p><font size="-1">Shaking her head, she tried 
                                  to get that vision out of her mind. As she drew 
                                  closer she saw the same crowd of people which 
                                  had been there to watch the battle. Looking 
                                  thru the crowd of people, Circe saw a smirk, 
                                  Hedron's smirk, and his evil dark eyes. Without 
                                  him even speaking she knew to go to him, to 
                                  be by his side. As she stood beside him she 
                                  felt his massive arms engulf her body, pulling 
                                  her close. He explain to her in a whisper that 
                                  she would be his pet, but more then that, his 
                                  puppet, to say as he wished her to say, and 
                                  do as he wished her to do.</font></p>

                                <p><font size="-1">The night air outside the hell 
                                  hole was filled with its usual foul stench. 
                                  Only so much blood can slick the walls of a 
                                  pit like this before the stench starts to show. 
                                  But the Gods of KAAOS paid it no mind. To them 
                                  the corrupt smell of death was just the sweet 
                                  air of home.</font></p>
                                <p><font size="-1">Inside, it was the night of 
                                  gathering. The Gods were arriving in their usual 
                                  haphazard manner, flashing in from thin air, 
                                  blasting in through a hole blown in the raw 
                                  stone, staggering in drunken from the outside, 
                                  or even just waking up from the floor they had 
                                  passed out on the night before. Screams of mortals 
                                  being tortured for pleasure in the background 
                                  filled the ears for miles around. Any half-sensitive 
                                  mage could feel the magical presence from across 
                                  the realms and stayed clear.</font></p>

                                  his infamous &quot;Meat Puppet Theater.&quot; 
                                  But not a word was spoken of who he had wrested

                                  heights as it does at every Hell Hole. Gobbets

                                  blood on those beneath its path and evil laughter 
                                  rang from every wall. Magical energies buffeted 
                                  the Gods as they slammed bolt after bolt of 
                                  raw power into each other as minor disagreements 
                                  flared into death struggles.</font></p>

                                  was as usual. It was in the moment that Hedron,

                                  the air near the mouth of the Hell Hole that 
                                  things became unusual. A quiet... or at least 
                                  what passes for one in the Hell Hole... descended 
                                  upon the crowd.</font></p>

                                  and the doors at the mouth of the Hell Hole 
                                  slowly began to drift open. Darkness lay beyond 
                                  and courtesy of Hedron's magics, not even the 
                                  eyes of the immortals could penetrate that darkness. 
                                  From somewhere inside of it a woman's hand pushed 
                                  its way out. Grabbing the edge of one door the 
                                  figure pulled itself into the light.</font></p>
                                <p><font size="-1">Tanned and oiled flesh began 
                                  at the tip of her toes. The Gods' eyes difted 
                                  slowly up her shapely leg, tracing the curves 
                                  over her flat belly, over her breasts, and up 
                                  the face of one of a member of the only guild 
                                  in the realms to even pretend to compete with 
                                  the Gods of KAAOS.</font></p>

                                  to some inner song that none but she could hear, 
                                  Circe danced her way into the great hall. The 
                                  torch light shined off the hot oils that had 
                                  been applied to every inch of her, and her lush 
                                  body undulated beneath the scraps of clothing 
                                  that Hedron had applied to her like garnishes 
                                  on a meal. Her blonde hair was brushed forward, 
                                  partially hiding her face. This was the only 
                                  sign of the shame that must have been tormenting 
                                  her in the inner secret portion of her will 
                                  that Hedron did not own completely through the 
                                  ritual of her True Name.</font></p>

                                  serpentined past the tables of drunken Gods. 
                                  Hedron mysteriously appeared in even deeper 
                                  shadows behind Malhavok, unnoticed at first. 
                                  He leaned forward with a grin.</font></p>

                                  expression was gleefull at the thought of what 
                                  he was making her do... what he would make her 
                                  do still. His eyes held that sick shine that 
                                  they always manifested as he walked into his 
                                  torture rooms.</font></p>
                                <p><font size="-1">&quot;She's... suitable, Hedron,&quot; 
                                  whispered the ancient evil back. He paused, 
                                  diabolical thought racing across his expression. 
                                  &quot;You must understand I can give you no 
                                  true opinion without closer observation. Much 
                                  closer. Perhaps in my lab.&quot;</font></p>
                                <p><font size="-1">&quot;Certainly, Malhavok. 
                                  And before the night is done, I can say that 
                                  she will be available for close observation. 
                                  She'll be visiting your lab. Of that you should 
                                  have no doubt.&quot; With a tight little smile 
                                  Hedron leaned back into the shadows and disappeared 
                                  again.</font></p>
                                <p><font size="-1">And the spectacle went on....</font></p>
