         <blockquote>
         For the record, the "rough crowd" I run with is ONLINE. The people I come into contact with do not feel the need to be polite or maintain manners - use yourself as an example. I don't know what kind of excuses you've fed yourself for your post on the Lum board, well actually I do, they're all right there. "She deserves it", why? Because umm.... Oh yes, because I thought Ego was using the message board to play a game. And because Mercs messed up an ONLINE wedding? I have no knowledge of them doing this recently, I recall the Mercs of old descending upon a host in Yserbius where a wedding was taking place and challenging all the guests. When the Mercs hosted a "fight night" in AC they were prepared for people that would want to disrupt the event, they had high level power people on guard at all points to stop the intruders - while not the point of this post perhaps you might want to pass that suggestion on to other ONLINE brides and grooms.<P>My first impression from your post is that you really need to take some time off the computer. There is absolutely no distinction in your mind between real life and ONLINE. How unfortunate.<P>I haven't been "humiliated" by any of this. Its really hard for me to get worked up because somebody thinks I missed a time period by 100 years, or because somebody else they're just too cool to have fun my way. What I SAID was that if I make a move to put something public, and then I tell people about it within that "rough crowd" (aka lacking in restraint and etiquette) then I really have nobody at all to blame but myself for the fall out. Yes, I DESERVE to have to listen to people like you bellowing about ONLINE weddings and what some group of people that have NOTHING to do with my reality did at some ONLINE wedding.<P>Since you have shown no ability to seperate my reality from your fantasy I forgive you your childish words. Maybe online is all you've got, maybe is where you're best. I use online to supplement my leisure time, not give meaning to my life. <P>Be strong. Be happy.
