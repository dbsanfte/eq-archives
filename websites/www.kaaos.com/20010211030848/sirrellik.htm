              <blockquote> 
                <p><font color="#999999">He is over a millennium in age, but few 
                  have guessed him to be past his late twenties. His hair is long, 
                  the color of the burning sun. His skin is deeply tanned and 
                  above his scarred cheekbones his eyes are a menacing steel grey. 
                  This GOD's name is RELLIKK, and untold thousands have died cursing 
                  his name.</font></p>

                  Bards sing about:</font></p>
                <p><font color="#999999">'Heh Heh!' were the only words to come 
                  from his lips, as he pulled out his 9 inch serrated dagger. 
                  Knowing that actions speak louder than words he finished off 
                  his opponent and walked off with a stagger.</font></p>
                <p><font color="#999999">Glancing back, he watched the other's 
                  blood soak into the ground and with a grin at the sight he yelled 
                  &quot;Take it, wuss!&quot; Already turning to look for another 
                  to fight, careful to not make a sound, Sir Rellik thought of 
                  hot tubs, spritzers and a certain Spiked Boot.</font></p>
                <p><font color="#999999">KAAOS knows no bounds in the destruction 
                  of all that is good and do not hold any barriers to those that 
                  want to join its cause. They proclaim themselves Gods and Goddesses 
                  over all and their arrival in your midst is always enough to 
                  give you pause.&quot;</font></p>

                  I spied him in the woods. His Ebony Armor gleaming in the Moonlight. 
                  His blond locks almost hidden under his Basilisk helm. His dagger….the 
                  9 inch-serrated pillager of souls. His very aura swelled with 
                  Evil. His steel grey eyes…..Many a woman, I am sure has lost 
                  herself within their depths. So this is what a God whom has 
                  chosen to walk the realms looks like. I am impressed.&quot;

                  Champ, Multiple singles and doubles ladder champ. RELLIKK has 
                  a 1st and 3rd in the Azuth’s Challenge. RELLIKK is the defending 
                  champion of the Mech Joust. &nbsp;RELLIKK came in third to Slayve 
                  and Ldy Spawn in the Singles Ladder tourney:</font></p>
                <p><font color="#999999">Seeing Sylphee approaching, the DreadLord 
                  ripped out his nine inch long serrated dagger and lunged as 
                  quick on his feet as a mountain lion. Unable to avoid the disemboweling 
                  thrust, Sylphee stopped in her tracks as pink coils of gore 
                  tumbled from her gut to be stamped into the ground by RELLIKK’s 
                  steel healed boot. Standing there, her life juices flowing onto 
                  the ground, Sylphee heard the God of KAAOS laugh, a laugh that 
                  sounded horrifyingly like the sudden, bronze note of a bell 
                  in hell.</font></p>
                <p><font color="#999999">The God of KAAOS wanted her soul. His 
                  frightful brain steeped in lore plumbed from the abysses and 
                  forbidden to mortals for millions of years, called forth a blast 
                  of lightning that fed her soul to the DreadLord as its shattering 
                  power burned the life out of her now soulless body.</font></p>
                <p><font color="#999999">RELLIKK, GM of KAAOS:</font></p>
                <p><font color="#999999">Entering the chaos known as the Hell 
                  Hole, RELLIKK bathed in the evil and horror that radiated from 
                  its occupants. The roasted body of a woman lay on a nearby table, 
                  skin charred, hair burned away. Her heart lay simmering on a 
                  plate before Hedron while the brain was set before Ego Prime. 
                  To the side Kal Mirage was performing unnatural acts with the 
                  dead women’s spleen.</font></p>
                <p><font color="#999999">Laughter to curdle the hearts of heroes 
                  spilled from the Son of Bane’s mouth as he left his fellow Gods

                  deep beneath the KAAOS Citadel.</font></p>
                <p><font color="#999999">RELLIKK, Romeo to Vixen’s Juliet:</font></p>
                <p><font color="#999999">The night sky lay like a hot, caressing, 
                  silken blanket over the Neverwinter woods. Stars glittered in 
                  diamond splendor against the black sky as the bright orb of 
                  a full moon rode in the west.</font></p>
                <p><font color="#999999">Bathed in this celestial light was one 
                  of the most magnificent creatures seen in realms today. Vixen, 
                  her crimson eyes agleam with anticipation, was on the prowl. 
                  The thin black fabric of her favorite hunting dress fit perfectly 
                  over the curves of her young taunt body and was pulled low enough 
                  to reveal her dazzling ebony shoulders and the ruby necklace 
                  that was nestled in her cleavage. </font></p>
                <p><font color="#999999">The slender Drow Vampiress, with the 
                  sculptured form of a goddess, hurried towards her prey. As she 
                  ran through the night her dazzling beautiful silver hair swirled 
                  behind her, her supple ebony limbs moving in perfect harmony 
                  as she reached her destination.</font></p>
                <p><font color="#999999">Standing at the edge of clearing, the 
                  rising and falling of her perfectly formed chest slowing, Vixen 
                  sighted her prey. </font></p>
                <p><font color="#999999">In the center of the clearing stood an 
                  apparition of death incarnate. From the soles of his black boots 
                  to the top of his basilisk horned helmet, RELLIKK was bespattered 
                  with large splotches of dusty, crusty blood, sprinkled with 
                  pieces of flesh and chips of white bone. His terrible blade, 
                  dripping slow, clotting droplets onto the black spiked platemail 
                  covering his left leg was being used to shove hunks of crimson 
                  gore into his mouth.</font></p>
                <p><font color="#999999">But beneath his grime covered blond hair, 
                  his steel gray eyes sparkled and a smile of future delight partially 
                  erased the look of death that usually covered his weather browned 
                  face. When he sighted Vixen approaching, his smile broadened 
                  and he raised his bloodslimy gauntleted hand in greeting.</font></p>
                <p><font color="#999999">Her incessant hunger temporarily sated, 
                  Vixen Faen Tlabbar, vampire priestess of Lloth, lay by the side 
                  of her huge lover, nibbling on his neck. She purred in Rellikk's 
                  ear with evil glee, as she pressed her ebony body close to his,</font></p>
                <p><font color="#999999">The vampiress slid up on top of her evil 
                  lover and teased, &quot;Oh, most wicked son of Bane, your treachery 
                  and cunning is exceeded only by your prowess as a lover.&quot; 
                  Rellikk's deep growl echoed like thunder on the massive stones, 
                  as he pulled Vixen's voluptuous body close, ready for more....</font></p>
