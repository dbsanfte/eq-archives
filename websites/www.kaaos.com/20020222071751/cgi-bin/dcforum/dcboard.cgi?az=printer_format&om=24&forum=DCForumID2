<blockquote>Original message posted by Sanith Anselmo:<P>-roleplay- A dark man trots slowly up to the KAAOS keep, black horse and cloaked with a black shroud, his eyes glow red as the firery blazes of hell. As he approaches the gate, he dismounts and transforms into a rat, making his way into the castle. KAAOS had just sat down for there nightly feast, and tales of their many brave deeds and how many people fell to their sword that very day. The door SLAMS open! The dark man asks "Aye, hello," " Who is in charge here? I have a proposal to make." Sir Rellik stands up bravely, "I am the king of this castle, and who are you?". "I am Sinath, Seventh Son of Hell.", his eyes begin to radiate as he pulls his cloak from his face. "I wish to join you and your minions quest to put fear into all those who dare stand in your way." He slaps a small scroll on the large wooden table, and rides off into the night.</blockquote><hr><b><font size=2>Table of contents</font></b><hr>

<b>"The meeting...."</b><br>

As the cloaked rider trotted along the heavily forested path the cool night air seemed to get cooler. The darkness seemed to get darker. His mount, a well trained steed, snorted and started to prance about nervously. The rider, no stranger to battle, felt the hairs on the back of his neck give rise. Something amiss, yet there was no sound......strange....no sound. No sound at all. Nothing. He couldn’t even hear his horse's hooves clacking with each nervous step. It was as if the world was suddenly devoid of sound. The darkness seemed to close in on him as he reigned his mount to a halt. Though he knew he was outdoors, the feeling was claustrophobic, as if he was locked, scrunched, in a box. Standing in his stirrups he peered into the darkness as he held a short reign on his nervous mount. Nothing.......not a damn thing. The darkness was overwhelming. The quiet, engulfing. The rider reached for his sword, hilt worn from countless battles.....the distinctive ring of the weapon exiting the scabbard gave calm. Sound had apparently not left the world. Just then his keen senses picked up a faint metallic ting sound and a slight whisper of air being dispersed...a whisper moving quickly towards him. He wheeled his mount, ready to face his aggressor, when he caught sight of a small glint of metal arching towards him. He reached up and snatched the glint of metal from the air. He lowered his arm, turned his palm up, and opened his hand. He held a single gold coin, a coin with markings the likes he’d never seen before. Perplexed, he stared at the coin.<P>“My my, you must be blessed, to have coins fall from the heavens upon thee”<P>The rider jerked his head up and tried to face his mount in the direction of the voice but it seemed to be coming from every direction. “Who are you? And more importantly...where are you?”<P>“Who am I? Why I’m an insignificant old man, you need not fear me. As for where I am.....why, I am right in front of you”<P>The rider looked down from his mount and saw an old man with dusty tattered robes before him, where there was nobody a moment ago. The rider spat “fool old man, you’ll be trampled standing out in the middle of the path like that”.<P>“I know them you know”<P>“You know who?” asked the rider.<P>“Those which you believed you saw”<P>“I’ve no time for riddles old man, either speak clearly or step aside lest I run ye down”.<P>“Ah, the impatience of youth....I think you know to whom I refer. They aren’t what you may believe they are.”<P>“How do you mean?”<P>The old man gestured towards his feet, what the rider saw could only be described as a shell of a man. A badly deformed man, mumbling incoherently as he groveled in the dirt. The man looked up and the rider saw the terrible face. An eyeless face scared beyond recognition.<P>“What is this old man?”<P>“This, my friend, was once a mighty warrior, much like yourself. He too sought those whom you seek.”<P>“What happened to him?”<P>“His search was successful, he was shown KAAOS, true KAAOS. What he saw was more than his mortal eyes could bear I’m afraid. He gouged his own eyes out so as not to have to look upon the horror. To late though, his mind was irreparably warped beyond comprehensive sanity.” <P>“Bah, weak fool. I’ve seen horrors beyond explanation, most cause by my own sword” grinned the rider.<P>The old man started to laugh, a quiet laugh yet it seemed to engulf the world around them. “My young friend, is that what you think KAAOS is? Hacking off a few limbs? Slaying a few warriors? Disemboweling a few whores perhaps? No no my friend, KAAOS is not about simple mortality, simple killing. Why that’s child’s play.” <P>“I shy away from no man, from no fight. I enter battle without fear, without remorse. I’ve killed more men than you could fathom old man and I’m not about to turn back now.”<P>The old man waived his hand in dismissal “yes yes, the fearless warrior, laying waste to those who oppose him. But are you prepared to pay the price? There is no turning back. Once you look upon KAAOS the price will be paid. You either become what you seek or you become this miserable wretch beneath my feet.” <P>“I’ve already looked upon KAAOS and it’s nothing I need shy away from.” <P>“FOOL! You saw NOTHING. You saw what they wanted you to see. You can’t begin to imagine what lies beneath the Hell Hole. The torture is indescribable, the pain insufferable.....and it is without end. Your mortal life is but a fleck of sand. There is no pain that can be caused to your mortal body in a lifetime that could compare to the pain that can be caused to your soul within the first few moments you are cast into the Hell Hole. And this is a pain that will last for eternity. They will feast upon your soul and if you are not strong enough you will become much less than this....this wretched excuse for a lump of flesh.” The old man kicked the mumbling eyeless wretch who didn’t seem to notice or feel a thing.<P>The rider laughed “Pain? I know all about pain. And suffering? I am suffering incarnate! I am more than a man old fool and I will not be denied.”<P>“We shall see young one.....we shall see”<P>With that there was a clash of sudden sound, of sudden awareness. The world returned, the night returned, the cool air returned to just that..... The old man was gone, the eyeless wretch was gone. All that was left was the single gold coin which the rider still clutched within his fist.........<P>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<P>“You and that damned gold coin Azmodion” smirked Hedron.<P>“Ah but that coin has served me well dear Hedron. The lure of fortune has always kept my hunger satiated. Feasting on the bittersweet taste of misfortune which lingers on the soul is my one true vice I must admit.” <P>Hedron raised an eyebrow “You know, I’ve always found vices to be a display of weakness”<P>“Don’t push me Hedron” scowled Azmodion.<P>Hedron simply laughed at what Azmodion didn’t seem to find amusing.<P><BR>Azmodion<BR>Lord of Misery<BR>KAAOS God of Misfortune

as Sinath stared at the coin he wondered what all the tiny detailed etchings meant, for this was not a coin someone would wish to own as a item of value, the coin had an essence of darkness surrounding it, a glimmer of fate. Sinath grinned and his eyes glowed bright once more. He turned down the path once again to go to see the KAAOS once more, but behold there was no castle, a mere plain of brown tall grass. In amazement he stared, looking around for the gigantic castle. Confused about tonights events he took a small blanket from his pouch his horse held, spread it over the group beneath him, and fell asleep. He woke up to a beautiful voice calling his name, a woman. "Hi my name Gwena, are you ok M'lord?", Sinath reorted "What is a small whore as yourself, doing way out in the wilderness? scoot back to your life of begging, and selling yourself, begone NOW before I paint these tree's red with your blood!" With that the girl ran off frightened, as Sinath stood up 3 small druids surrounded him, and before he could unsheath his sword. The druids quickly grabbed and one said, "There is no love in being hated by all." Sinath grinned, "Little man I am loved by none, but feared by all, if you do not tell your piss ants to let me go I will slay you all." with that the druid sighed, and unleashed a force of nature upon Sinath, As the dwarfs moved out the way Sinath quickly grabbed his sword, but he noticed something the coin was imbedded in the handle of the sword, and it glowed profusely, "The dwarfs gasped, "You hold the coin of Azmodion!", he replied "What is that? and what does it do?" the dwarfs not filled with fear. It is said the coin can steal souls, and the weapon it combines with... holds in it the souls forever. Sinath struck down the leader with one blow across the back of the neck, and his head hit the dirt path with a small -THUD- the sword now glowed from red to black, and Sinath could feel the dwarfs soul being bestowed into his great sword. As for the other two the chanted a quick few words and were gone into the thick forest. As Sinath still being confused about last nights event and this "Gold Coin" his world plunged into darkness.........
