                  the existence of video games, the great majority of them, have 
                  been of some competetive nature, of sorts. Whether it be a fighting 
                  game, strategy game, sport game, action game, adventure game, 
                  or RPG style game... the one thing that all of these have in 
                  common is that it pits players against players in a competetive 
                  environment. With that being said, I cannot understand why the 
                  main focus of a massive multiplayer game should NOT be combat 
                  oriented. The idea of gaining virtual money and virtual real 
                  estate, of gaining cool items, and the like, while being a necessary 
                  part of the gaming environment, these types of things should 
                  NOT be a central focus. Now, that is not to say that roleplay 
                  has no part in gaming. In fact, the complete opposite is true, 
                  roleplay is essential to gaming. But the nature of this roleplay 
                  should not be geared only towards happy trading between people, 
                  buying houses, and being fishermen. Instead, one must realize 
                  that the whole reason fantasy worlds exist is to teleport the 
                  player into a peril fraught world, one where dragons roam free, 
                  one where you can slit your neighbor's throat and no one will 
                  care too much, and one where you are constantly in a struggle 
                  for survival. After having said all that, these 10 components 
                  are what strike me as the most essential components which would 
                  be necessary in creating the perfect game. </font></p>

                  Since combat, struggle, and survival are the key underlying 
                  themes to the world, a turn based environment is needed. This 
                  environment provides those involved with a small, finite period 
                  of time in which they have the ability to think, plan, communicate, 
                  and then act. The turn based environment provides for a fair 
                  way of giving each person time to think, act, and react. This 
                  type of environment eliminates the problems of lag, ping times, 
                  bad connections, and quick twitch reflexes (ie, the click-fest 
                  which many games have become).</font></p>

                  From the turn based environment, strategic PvP will develop 
                  (assuming III. IV. and V. have been met). Strategic PvP grows 
                  from the ability of each person not having to rely on quick 
                  clicking ability, but rather on their wits and tactical skill. 
                  Since the world and combat space are a finite space, it becomes 
                  like a game of chess, one players moves, the other player reacts, 
                  until there is a victor. The victor is the person who showed 
                  mastery of the terrain, his weapons, and of being able to out 
                  battle his opponent. Strategical combat also requires: </font></p>

                  By this I mean that for most (preferrably all) possible attacks, 
                  that the opponent has some sort of option (whether he chooses 
                  to take it or not is up to him) whereby he could divert or minimize 
                  the attack against him. This is a system of balancing powerful 
                  attacks with powerful defenses, something which the games of 
                  recent have ignored. One cannot hope to have Strategical Combat 
                  when an opponent can throw a 2000 points of damage spell that 
                  has no chance of being minimized, other than by sheer luck. 
                  This system of checks and balances provides for a more strategical 
                  environment. Again, in chess, each pieces has its strengths, 
                  each piece has its weaknesses. Other pieces exploit these weaknesses, 
                  or divert their strengths.</font></p>

                  everyone will be on a more or less level field. Balance will 
                  exist because of III. and IV. thus making the combat meaningful.

                  Whereas in recent games (as people have mentioned recently on 
                  this board) the drive behind the players was to acquire money, 
                  equipment or other "material" possessions, this, in fact, is 
                  detrimental to the gaming environment. This promotes random 
                  acts of killing and only random acts of killing. The drive for 
                  loot destroys the hopes of the strategic combat. Instead of 
                  this drive for loot, it is important that the notion of power, 
                  skill, and respect be part of the environment. Organized events 
                  (combat oriented, guild oriented, problem solving events, etc) 
                  are a means to producing a heirarchy amongst the various guilds 
                  and players. The drive should be to become the best and most 
                  respected, not to become the richest. </font></p>

                  Sprouting from the turn based gaming environment, roleplay can 
                  flourish. Since players don't need to worry about being jumped 
                  as they sit at a zone gate and don't need to worry about getting 
                  the "click, click, click" death of UO and EQ. Instead, should 
                  a combat situation occur, since the combat is turn based, the 
                  encounter can be roleplayed instead of having to react and flee 
                  or whatever. Also, aside from the combat based roleplay, general 
                  roleplay is also necessary. This roleply can be largely based 
                  on VI. and the power of the different guilds and respect that 
                  has been awarded to the prominent players. Roleplay also helps

                  there needs to be a centralized message board system. This is 
                  key for outside the game roleplaying, It is important that everyone 
                  knows where to find out about the other guilds, their goings 
                  on, their players, and it is a good place for in game events 
                  to be developed and discussed. </font></p>

                  The chat engine must be exemplary. There need not be any shout 
                  commands or ooc commands that broadcast to the whole world, 
                  but there needs to be private messages and an easy to read and 
                  contribute to chat window/engine. The chat is important to both 
                  roleplay and pvp. PvP, like roleplay, requires communication. 
                  Without communication, the game loses a part of it's strategy 
                  and it also loses part of it's community. With a chat engine 
                  like ultima online's, the community can never develop. </font></p>

                  The community of the game needs to be developed. Many of these 
                  factors contribute to the development of the aforementioned 
                  community. As the community develops, it is possible to have 
                  meaningful events in the game, quests, and other adventures. 
                  Guild on guild combat, team combat, pvp ladders, and the like 
                  are all a part of this and are all necessary for the game to 
                  be the ideal game. NPCs and AI only offer so much challenge 
                  and get quite boring very quickly. With players becoming a major 
                  factor in the game, and with the communal heirarchy developing 
                  and constantly being challenged and rewritten, this allows for 
                  the game to be complete. It now has the ideal combat and the 
                  ideal community and thus, it is the ideal game. PvP, Roleplay, 
                  and Community need to develop in the proper way, or the game 
                  will not be ideal, and will flop. All three are important and 
                  all three are interrelated. None can be sacrificed, all must 
                  be present. </font></p>
