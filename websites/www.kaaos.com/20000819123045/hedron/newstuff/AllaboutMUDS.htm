[Ed: I found this interesting read over at alt.games.everquest ... what a busy group that is ... had never been there before] <p>Welcome To The Player Wimping Guidebook!<br>(or how to dry up your mud in no time)<p>uking up a mud is surprisingly simple. With a little bit of time and<br>dedicated effort to your own stupidity, you too can ruin your mud for the<br>players, cause strife beyond belief, and take your mud down a slow spiral to<br>implosion from within. The two best ways to do this are Wiping and Wimping.<p>For those of you new to being little tin gods, I will be using the following<br>definitions:<p><br>----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>----<p>Terms Used Here:<p>Imms, Immortals, Gods: Those who run a mud. These are the admins that build<br>or oversee the mud. Sometimes called Dungeon Masters or GMs, DMs, or IMPs.<p>Mud: Not the gooey stuff women wrestle in, but a multi-user dungeon. An<br>online game where multiple players interact with each other and computer<br>generated monsters.<p>Mobs: No, not 100 middle-aged women in a store with a big shoe sale! Mob<br>refers to computer generated monsters on a Mud.<p>Trolls: People who simply like to cause problems and get off on watching the<br>resultant fallout and fighting.<p>Wiping: is the act of doing a player file wipe. This destroys all player<br>information, including hours played, gold collected, equipment earned, and<br>all other facets of the character. It may or may not include the player's<br>name.<p>Wimping: is the act of taking away from a player's skills, spells, or<br>effectiveness in some other way, such as reducing weapon effectiveness or<br>boosting mobs (computer generated monsters) to an incredible degree. It can<br>also refer to the reduction of gold. Wimping is called nerfing or blunting<br>in many circles.<p><br>----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>----<p>Player Wimping A Critical Examination<p>Generally done under the rationalization of "mud balancing" or "restoring<br>the challenge" the act of wimping players or 'nerfing' is one of the most<br>insidious acts one can undertake. Wimping results in more hurt players, and<br>more shattered morale for a mud than anything any player could ever<br>accomplish. What is worse is that it is done by those who ostensibly are<br>tasked with protecting the game and making it a better place to spend your<br>entertainment hours. Wimping has destroyed more than one mud that I have<br>been on, and has hurt loyal mudders across the world.<p><br>----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>----<p>Best Intentions:<p>Almost without fail, when a mud starts, it starts because a player decides<br>the gaming world needs something "friendly and unique" and finds himself in<br>a situation where he is not satisfied with how the mud he is on is run. The<br>player, now a new Implementor (chief administrator) believes that he can do<br>a better job than those whose mud he has left and so he simply starts his<br>own. In many instances he is disappointed or sad at the way that players on<br>his X-mud have been treated and thinks he can do it better, making an<br>environment where people can feel wanted and safe. Indeed the ideal he<br>starts with is to become for his players what he wished the gods on his<br>X-mud had been for him. So he sets about the task.<p>His idealism is in full bloom as he hires a staff of builders and coders and<br>installs a couple of gods, (usually friends from his X-mud), and he then<br>sets out to make a wonderful new place for people to come and enjoy. He goes<br>to great lengths to find out what players want in a mud and does his best<br>within reason to accomplish it. As part of this process he puts together an<br>Alpha-Test team, (usually a group of players from his old mud), and later he<br>opens the mud up for Beta-Testing. During these two formative stages,<br>adventuring areas are built, weapons are made, gold is calculated, spells,<br>skills and player attributes are decided upon and put in place. It is a hell<br>of a lot of work.<p>Of necessity Alpha and Beta testing are times of changes, massive equip and<br>spell adjustments, boosting and reducing of mobs, gold and whatnot. The<br>basics are balanced. Weapons are made to be effective but not insane in<br>their power, spells and skills get the same treatment. Mobs are made to be a<br>challenge but not suicidal - which is a demoralizer for players. During the<br>beta-test time, all that is to come is set up, balanced, and put in place<br>for the people who will come to play. When this Herculean task is finished<br>the mud is opened up to the public. Sometimes a player-file wipe is done and<br>all of the beta tester's characters are destroyed so everyone starts out on<br>equal footing. Many times Imps give those kind enough to have been alpha or<br>beta testers some incentive like leveling tokens or something for their<br>efforts and the time they invested in beta testing. The new mud is on the<br>air and everyone is excited!<p><p>The Honeymoon:<p>As the mud opens, the gods and builders are visible and helpful, they give<br>freely of their time to players with little grudging. The Imms make attempts<br>to get people to come try their mud and they are usually responsive to<br>players requests. The Imms and builders PLAY their own mud, (as opposed to<br>just RULING it) , leveling characters and grouping with those players they<br>are there to serve. Imms will sometimes make it known who they are sometimes<br>not so as to judge how well the players are enjoying their new creation. In<br>short the Imms CARE about how the players feel about the mud, and they are<br>more interested in the players than they are in anything else. This period<br>can vary in length greatly depending on the personalities involved and just<br>how idealistic the new IMP and his gods are about making players happy. It<br>is a good time to be in the game for everyone.<p>At this stage players are the reason for the mud. The Imms know why they<br>went to all this work, it was to make the players happy! And by god they are<br>there to do just that... for a while.<p>As time goes on however, the mud begins to grow. As may be easily surmised<br>so do player requests for interaction and assistance, requests for special<br>favors or weapons, demands for change to the basic skill set, and a plethora<br>of other demands and expectations that can be expected from the type of<br>people drawn to mudding and role playing games in general. At first, the IMP<br>and his gods do their best to keep people happy, sometimes giving in to<br>truly bad or stupid ideas and even fringe-player demands. It is likely that<br>they will give in against their own gut feelings when they do some of these<br>things. In their rightly motivated effort to please they sometimes go<br>further than they should thus setting themselves up to fail.<p>After a while things begin to change for the Imms... not in the mud or with<br>the players but within themselves.<p>Midlife Crisis:<p>Somewhere along the way the gods begin to feel pressured and they begin to<br>withdraw. Slightly at first, simply going invisible, but they still talk<br>regularly with players. But it does not stop, things slide more and more and<br>they find themselves slowly cutting even simple player discussion down. Soon<br>the Imms find themselves only talking to their peers. They start to see<br>players as a bunch of whiney cheaters who are there simply there to take<br>advantage of the generosity offered by the immortal staff.<p>Another thing that seems to happen about this time is that the gods begin to<br>re-examine things that a year or six months ago were just fine and were<br>accepted as normal. For some reason they reach a point where they find fault<br>with things that were okay just a month ago. Imms also begin to care less<br>and less about the PEOPLE on the mud, those who the mud was originally built<br>to serve, and they begin to think more in terms of the CREATION - that is<br>their computer-code, damage-tables, or the fact that people seem to be<br>actually having too much success by leveling in a quicker manner than the<br>gods think is reasonable.<p>In short the admins lose sight of the fact that people are having FUN, and<br>instead choose to dwell upon the fact that the mud didn't evolve, and<br>players didn't play in the way that they had pre-structured in their own<br>minds.<p>Danger Point:<p>It is at the point where the players become secondary to the creation that<br>the danger exists. Along with a select group of other gods, (generally the<br>ones perceived by players as having earned the rank to satiate their power<br>hungry or controlling natures), the IMPs begin to look at changing and<br>blunting ESTABLISHED skills spells or weapons. They talk to people who will<br>by their nature agree, asking little if any input from the players that will<br>be most affected by their choices. After all this is "not their mud" and<br>"they didn't work so hard to create it". The imms also tend not to ask<br>others who might disagree. Like generals who believe in their own<br>press-releases this self-serving time will cost them later.<p>The Imms now go back and revisit some of the 'special favors' they did for<br>people. The realize that they made mistakes in trying to kiss ass to those<br>they tried to draw to their mud and they start to make adjustments to the<br>things that they themselves fucked up in an early attempt to please. Many<br>times this is somewhat justified, one or two spells might just be way<br>overpowered. These are changed, and the predictable outcry from those<br>affected occurs. The imms put up with this, attempting to justify their<br>actions, and taking time to try to mollify the people who have been hurt.<br>They even apologize and in some cases admit their own culpability. However<br>at the same time there is an undercurrent of resentful feelings that the<br>players would "whine" so much and "create so many problems" over something<br>that was obviously so wrong.<p>This sets them up for the mind set wherein the players become even more of<br>an enemy. All later complaints are relegated to "whining" or "selfish<br>bitching" and when the next round of wimping comes, with its predictable<br>outrage the Imms don't try to explain it nearly as well, instead opting to<br>be aloof and uncaring or they will blame it on players for 'overusing' an<br>item or spell. Some will even blame it on builders or imms who have departed<br>and can not defend themselves. The mindset does not abate even later when<br>Imms are mucking with things they should not be. At that point they actively<br>antagonize players and the 'my mud not theirs' mindset is fully realized. In<br>short they set themselves up against the players and so their<br>rationalization is that no matter what they do the players will be a bunch<br>of whiners...<p>What has happened is a marked shift from player centerdness to one of<br>worshiping at the alter of their creation - the software program that runs<br>the mud. Damage tables become more important than player satisfaction and<br>they begin to seek out the most minor of things to change in what was once a<br>well established world under the banner of 'making everything equal'.<p>As time goes by pressures of all kinds, from the external player complaints<br>about other classes to Imms own air-headed want to relegate players to a<br>pre-structured jail cell of how the Imms expected people to play or level<br>becomes much more important than player happiness and more and more things<br>are slated to be wimped; weapons, gold, good-solid established skills or<br>spells.. nothing is safe, nothing is sacred.<p>Within the players, this produces a natural, rational, and predictable<br>reaction. What they counted on today may not be there tomorrow. These gods<br>that were so kind and helpful before have now become the adversaries, seen<br>as tyrants or people not to be trusted because they have betrayed the<br>implied and implicit trust that the players gave them when they decided to<br>invest their personal time and play the mud on a regular basis.<p><p>The Death Spiral:<p>As the immortals, (and yes I do place full responsibility on the immortals,<br>because it is in fact they who have the power to ameliorate things, and the<br>responsibility to the mud NOT to do it in the first place), continue to wimp<br>players, boost mobs, drop gold gathering abilities, raise prices, and reduce<br>weapon effectiveness, players begin to align themselves into two camps. One<br>group who "backs the Imms, 'because they know best and wouldn't hurt us'",<br>and one group who feels "betrayed and hurt" by the removal or destruction of<br>that which they have worked so hard to obtain.<p>The first group, the 'god-backers' seems to break down into three subgroups.<br>Before determining how great you are for your wonderful wimping, consider<br>the fact that the motivations of those players that appear to be backing you<br>may not be as pure as you believe.<p><br>Factionalization Of The Mud:<p>Once the wimping begins the mud breaks into little parts. Myopia sets in and<br>people begin to lose sight of the fact that once they were all friends and<br>having fun playing together. Instead it becomes a power struggle and a<br>political infight with groups breaking off into encampments trying to get<br>their way. If the IMPS have foolishly surrounded themselves with "yes-man"<br>type gods, then this won't carry over into the administration, but if the<br>IMP had the forethought to install people as gods who would speak their own<br>mind, this factionalization will also occur in the immortal camp as well.<p><br>God backers seem to break down into one of these three groups:<p>Self-Preservationists - Probably the largest group on the god-backers team<br>are the self-preservationists. They are also the least loyal to your<br>position as an Imm bent on wimping. These people are participating in a<br>typical human reaction similar to that of the pre-war Germany where the<br>populace allowed those in power to take rights and property from others, and<br>even SUPPORTED it in the vain and stupid hope that the authorities would<br>remember them, and not take similar action against their race or class at a<br>later date. As with the people in Germany, this belief of course vanished as<br>soon as the authorities turned their interest toward their particular<br>minority. It is indeed gratifying to watch self-preservationists become<br>enraged and vocal when they get the nerfed as the self-preservationists tend<br>to be the ones that have the fiercest and most vociferous outcry when THEY<br>are the ones being betrayed by the administrators of the mud. The already<br>wimped players will see this as an ironic form of justice for not having<br>stood by them when the imms were mucking up their stuff.<p>Ass-Kissers - When an established skill or spell is taken from others, a<br>very significant portion of those who back you as an Imm are doing so for<br>the sole reason that they would blindly agree to any damn thing you did! You<br>should already know the kind. These people likely want to ingratiate<br>themselves to you because they have their own aspirations for immhood in the<br>future and know full well that being buddies with a god, (especially when<br>standing up for an unpopular action), will win them approval with you and<br>subsequent favors or other consideration or bent rules. It is also important<br>to remember that many people who want to cause strife to your mud, (See<br>'Bitchers' in the next section), will pretend to agree with you because its<br>the best way that they can think of to be able to SAFELY (to themselves)<br>stir the shit with arguments which they know will cause problems and hurt<br>others in order to meet their final agenda. Online these people are known as<br>trolls.<p>Genuine-Believers - There will be a few people who will genuinely and<br>honestly believe that what you are doing is right. A person is most likely<br>to belong to this group if he agrees with what you are doing and it is being<br>done to him. (Although its very important to remember that the Ass-Kissers<br>many times will do this even to their own detriment.) Genuine believers may<br>believe their points after rational and cerebral introspection, or they may<br>simply be blind followers. The fact that you can find people to agree with<br>you even if that belief is genuinely held in no way makes what you are doing<br>right however.<p><br>In the same way as the god-backers have subgroups, so too do the<br>wimping-detractors.<p>The Betrayed - Probably the largest group of those who would be labeled<br>wimping-detractors are those who rightfully feel betrayed and hurt by the<br>immortals. These players have invested very significant periods of time on<br>the mud, and have raised themselves up to a certain level of skills and<br>spells by hard work and initiative. They have gone to great lengths to get<br>the equipment they feel is best, and they have developed a persona and a<br>playing style around the items and rules originally supplied to them by the<br>gods. They operate within the rules and use the equipment and spells to its<br>fullest advantage - as well they should - and then some Imm notices it and<br>BAM. These people have a genuine sense of betrayal. That which they were<br>allowed to earn is stolen from them by the very Immortals that they counted<br>upon to do right by them. They have lost abilities, or had them<br>significantly blunted by those who once said "We made this game for you, and<br>for your fun.". Instead those same immortals are now telling them "If you<br>don't like it start a new character or your own mud... we know what's best".<br>When the immortals take that attitude it simply reinforces the betrayed's<br>feelings and proves him right.<p>The Bitchers - There is a certain group of mudders who will always cause<br>problems. Wimping is but another excuse for them to attempt to cause strife<br>on the mud and to do the best they can to control other people by using the<br>unhappiness of the situation to make them do things they might not<br>ordinarily do. You will already know these people, as they never ever ever<br>have anything positive to say, they spend no time whatsoever trying to make<br>people happy or doing good, but instead always make it their business to<br>cause shit. They are labeled as trolls in many communities because they do<br>nothing more than spoil things for others. Though comprising nowhere NEAR<br>the numbers of actually betrayed people, the bitchers do present a<br>significant number of wimping detractors. These people should be completely<br>ignored by both sides in this battle as they are there for the sole purpose<br>of causing problems and inciting unhappiness.<p>The Ethical/Moralists - Most certainly the smallest group in the<br>wimping-detractors are those who have thought the issue through thoroughly,<br>not having taken into account how they were affected, but instead looking at<br>how things really are affecting people and determined that the wimping was<br>just simply wrong or unjust. These people will make good directed arguments<br>which show forethought and a care for players above all else, including the<br>sacred damage tables or other garbage that the imps might trot out to<br>justify their stance. Of course this pisses off the Imms even more because<br>the damage tables and economy tables are now the imms sacred cows, not the<br>players but they cant SAY that for obvious reasons. Hell maybe they don't<br>even see that in themselves!<p>Almost always the Ethical/Moralists people will find themselves ostracized<br>or vilified simply for speaking out, and because their arguments make sense,<br>they will be seen as a threat to the mud and to the mud by the admins. If<br>the Ethical/Moralists are gods on the game they are usually removed or<br>chastised for not being a "team player" rather than being allowed to speak<br>out, as their arguments are compelling and well directed.<p><p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>----<p>The Effect:<p>As you can see factionalization shatters the camaraderie and friendships<br>that a good mud will have groomed and encouraged. This downward spiral has<br>resulted in the death of more than one mud that I am personally familiar<br>with and made a couple others totally not worth the time to play... unless<br>of course you simply like to watch people fight. These actions pit friends<br>and players against each other in the same way as a civil war pits brother<br>against brother or adultery pits spouse against spouse. There can be no<br>winners once this occurs, only those who have not lost as much as others. Is<br>this what you want to have happen to your mud? Would you like a nice set of<br>well balanced tables, damages, leveling times, and the other things you seek<br>through wimping, or would you prefer to make 50 to 3000 people happy to play<br>on your mud without infighting?<p>The above described events comprise a circle where one screw-up feeds off of<br>another which feeds off of another until a continuing and destructive<br>downward spiral occurs. The spiral stops when one of two things happens,<br>either the mud dies because someone with enough power pulls the plug on the<br>mud itself out of disgust, or a large portion of the players and dissenting<br>immortal staff are purged or quit leaving only those who were in blind<br>agreement. The residual players and Imms are battered, bruised and wary from<br>the fight. People in this condition are in no mind set to help newbies or to<br>recruit new players and this apathy results in a feeling of morbidity that<br>takes months to dissipate.<p>Basically you've fucked yourself and your mud at this point.<p><br>Solutions and Suggestions:<p>So far I have presented the realities of what I opine happens when you wimp<br>or wipe your players and/or their equipment. Almost without exception it<br>results in pain, strife, fighting, factionalization, forced-deletions,<br>players quitting, rules about free expression imposed, and many other<br>negative repercussions. So what can you do? Your mud is unbalanced and<br>players are whining, your mathematical formulas don't add up the way you'd<br>like and you want to change something....<p>First re-evaluate. WHY are you considering making these changes, is it<br>because players are bitching that one class is better than the other or can<br>deal death out to mobs faster? Is it because you're bored and have nothing<br>better to do and you feel change for changes sake is good? Is it because you<br>have power, and just want to fuck with people? (If so don't bother to read<br>any more, just mail me so I never go to your mud. :P)<p>Second, look again at what you hope to accomplish and for whom. You likely<br>created this game in part to make people happy. It wasn't an exercise in<br>programming (well not in most cases anyway) it was to serve the public, do<br>do a greater good wasn't it? Or was it so you could stroke your ego? Was it<br>because you wanted to have power over people? Were you attracted by the hope<br>of power to make them sad to ruin their free-time, and to make their efforts<br>worthless? Naw, I didn't think so! If you don't do this wimping will your<br>mud fail? Doubtful. Unless you are a total fuck up and put in dozens of<br>things that were way to powerful from the start, and didn't sweep them out<br>in beta, then your mud will survive without the unfriendliness that wimping<br>will bring far better than after you participate in wimping.<p>Lastly, is it worth the cost? You are about to lose players and maybe an<br>immortal or two. Is this what you want to occur? Are players worth anything<br>to you? Will you GET more players in return for the ones you lost when the<br>game playing public hears of what a great job of wimping you have done? If<br>so have at it, but think... few people come to muds because they have heard<br>of how great the balance is, most people come because they hear the gods<br>make it a FUN place to play and that the people are friendly. Nerfing begets<br>the antithesis of a friendly environment.<p><br>----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>----<p>Last Logic:<p>I am sure that I haven't covered all potential arguments with the following<br>Q&A nor will I try, however you decide to ignore this, I do wish you and<br>your player-base luck.<p><br>But Tenny, some of my players are bitching that the classes aren't balanced!<p>Yea? when have they not bitched? I know it seems rhetorical, but some<br>players will ALWAYS bitch that the classes aren't balanced. Hell if you took<br>all classes off your mud except say warriors, and then you copied all of the<br>skill set into 4 other named classes, renamed the skills and classes, making<br>no adjustments, people would STILL say they weren't balanced. Instead simply<br>state up front, classes do not compare. Tell them, "Play the one you like<br>best for you, don't judge yourself against others, and if the one class is<br>much better make one of them". (don't then fuck that up by rebalancing<br>another class).<p>Now IF you are so damn interested in balancing classes, and you feel that<br>this is of paramount importance, then they key is to GIVE and not to take.<br>GIVE new skill-sets or powers to the ones you feel are weaker. There will be<br>some bitching from those who are who don't get something new, or increased<br>damage, but that will subside a lot faster and be far less divisive than if<br>you steal that which the others have already earned. If you are worried<br>about it making it easier to defeat mobs, then make a new area with bigger<br>mobs! People will always go for a challenge.<p>If you had two knives, one dull and one sharp, would it not make better<br>sense to make them equal by sharpening the dull one - not by blunting the<br>sharp one?<p>Computer generated creatures don't get their feelings hurt if they are<br>replaced or some new mob gets some special power. Players do.<p>Tenny, I just found out that the Druid Spell 'stick poke' has been<br>overpowered since we put it in!<br>Lets see if I got this right: You have an established spell that people have<br>come to rely upon that you just figured out all this time later was over<br>powered? Well then in point of fact it can't be that overpowered can it? If<br>it was, you would have seen this class just wiping the floor with the others<br>long before this and you would have corrected it within a month of its<br>inception. You did not. Therefore your assessment that this is going to mess<br>up your mud is fallacious. Had it been that big a deal before, it wouldn't<br>have gone for a period of months without being noticed.<p>Tenny, I put in some new equipment that makes the other stuff obsolete and<br>too high powered in comparison. Now I have to lower the older stuff so they<br>will want the new or so that there is more incentive to get it.<br>With all due respect, you are setting yourself up for failure. If your new<br>stuff is too powerful the answer in not to hurt the players that already<br>have the old stuff, its simply to lower the new stuff. You should have<br>looked at this before you put in the new items! If you don't lower the new<br>stuff, someday this new widget you put in today will look a lot like the old<br>stuff you're about to wimp. As for incentive, people will go to great<br>lengths to get that one extra damage roll or even just for bragging rights<br>("I got me a big mythril sword and I'm only the third person on the mud to<br>have done so!") So don't worry about it... and if the players don't want to<br>get the new thing... so what? Are you trying to stroke your equipment<br>building ego or is your goal to make a fun place to mud where people have<br>choices? Taking that which players have rightfully earned from them is<br>simply wrong.<p>Tenny, people are leveling too fast. I had envisioned it talking 3 months to<br>make Avatar, and this one guy did it in 2 weeks!!<br>So the players are having fun at the expense of how you perceived the mud<br>would play? They aren't sticking within your little cage of expectations and<br>are not blindly doing things in the way you had envisioned? Uhm, again with<br>all due respect SO WHAT? Did you see Jurassic Park? It makes for a good<br>analogy. Players are people - People, life itself, can not be boxed into<br>your perception of how to act and how to play. Some people mud to get<br>millions in virtual gold, some to attain levels, some want one Avatar<br>(highest level player) of each class, some come solely for social<br>interaction. As long as they are not maliciously hurting each other leave em<br>be and let them have fun!<p>To punish the average player for the success of your top ten percent players<br>is ridiculous. Unless your mud is dropping in players because massive<br>numbers of them are telling you 'this twink mud is too easy so I am<br>quitting', let them be! They are enjoying your creation as is! You made this<br>mud to be fun. People are having fun. THAT should be something you should<br>sit back and be proud of not screw around with simply to somehow chase the<br>unatainable ideal of making things appear fair, and never for some<br>mathematical calculation.<p>Tenny, I am in Beta test, and I don't want my players to keep all the stats<br>and weapons from our testing period, it wouldn't be fair.<br>This is the time where I agree that a Pfile wipe is appropriate. Also Alpha<br>and Beta testing is the time for you to make all the mods, wimping, tuning<br>and changes you're going to make on the basics. Beta testers should be told<br>in advance that they can count on a Pfile wipe. The problem is that most<br>IMPS look at normal mud life as an ongoing beta test and find themselves<br>continually fucking with established skills and spells. Do it once do it<br>right then leave it the hell alone. If you missed some moderate or small<br>problem after beta is over and people have come to count on it leave it the<br>hell alone. Nobody's gonna get hurt. Also you must give those nice people<br>that beta-tested for you some cool incentive to come back when the mud<br>opens, a few levels, or even a character that's half way up already, special<br>personalized equipment or something else that reflects your thanks for a job<br>well done.<p>Tenny, I just put in the Mage Spell 'urine pool' and found out that it is<br>too powerful, you cant say that I shouldn't reduce it are you?<br>Hell no! Though some would argue the point I don't feel I am that stupid.<br>When you have a brand new skill or spell make sure your players know that<br>you will be making changes as they are warranted. But hold yourself to a<br>limited beta period for each item. A month or two at the most. My thesis<br>through this entire treatise has been that it is the ESTABLISHED skills and<br>spells that you have a moral right not to mess with as people count on them.<br>If you put in something new, and people know that its in testing, then they<br>also know not to count on it. Once its in and relied upon, its too late.<p>Fine Tenny screw you, I will just tell everyone that NOTHING is stable or<br>static and that I can change anything I want to anytime and that if they<br>cant live with it then they should go to another mud.<br>Good! Now were making progress! At least you're finally being honest and<br>ethical with your players, even though you give them nothing to count on you<br>for - with the exception of change, loss, and pain, at least it is a fully<br>informed decision. You have given them all the consideration you morally<br>need to at this point. If they bitch after this then too bad. But do know<br>this, some people, (those who would be your most loyal 'cheerleaders'), will<br>be those who make a mud a long term home. Many measure this commitment in<br>years. If you take a stance like this, you will also find the loyalty<br>quotient to be fairly low. Nobody wants a long term commitment that<br>fluctuates. How would you like to be married to someone that would fluctuate<br>in how much they do drugs, commit adultery or beat you?<p>Tenny, I am a player and this wimping is happening to my mud, what can I do?<br>Hey! You are a PLAYER!?!?!? What are you doing reading this! Go away shoo!<br>Shoo! This was written for people a lot better than you, people more wise<br>and all knowing, people who KNOW that your ideas suck and that you have no<br>right to protest or complain! Go on hit the back button!<p>Seriously? Sadly my friend, it is likely you can not do not a damned<br>thing... I do NOT think that hiring a good sniper is a really prudent<br>solution and no matter how much you are upset, remember this IS a game and<br>it is completely insane to take any real life action of any kind against an<br>Imm over something as meaningless as mudding or online gaming. Try to write<br>well written notes to the Imps, complain publicly but not in a shrill<br>manner. Make your arguments using all the facts you can, and include in your<br>notes points that they make that you concede. Give them this URL if you<br>like. Try to be direct and always be honest. In point of fact tho, its not<br>gonna do a damn bit of good most likely. Decisions like this are made<br>usually made by people with the idea that players are going to bitch and for<br>whom the people who play their games are longer meaningful so their<br>happiness no longer drives the Imm staff. If that was the case, they would<br>have taken steps to avoid this sort of thing prior to your being upset.<p>If it bothers you enough, on either a personal level or on an ethical level<br>vote with your feet and leave the game. Let everyone know know why you are<br>taking this action, but don't do so with the intent to take others with<br>you... that's manipulative and wrong. When you go to your next mud or online<br>game, ask to talk to a god or better yet an imp. If one comes to you that's<br>a good sign. If they will talk openly and honestly with you about this topic<br>that's even better. You're about to make a commitment of some months and<br>many hours of your time, I don't think it unreasonable to ask a few pointed<br>questions. If they do think it is unreasonable.... do you really wish to<br>play there? I would not.<p><br>----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>----<p><p>Closing Thoughts:<p>As I close this, it must be more than obvious where I stand on the issue of<br>Wimping Players and why. I am empathetic, even sympathetic to a degree to<br>what as a Mud-God you are trying to accomplish but I can not support that<br>which causes people to be hurt or stolen from. As many are fond of pointing<br>out, this is only a game, and as a good friend, Danilo's mother pointed out<br>"Don't you play this game to have FUN?!?!". We as immortals are here for the<br>players of our respective muds. We are no more real gods than Mao Tse Tung<br>was, despite our power to cause hurt feelings and destroy hours of play on a<br>whim.<p>Because we posses dictatorial power does not mean we are obligated or even<br>free to use it.<p>Sadly many of us lose track of the real purpose of what we began our muds<br>for. We lose sight of why we left our last mud, and begin to see our mortal<br>players as the enemy. Is it any wonder why we offer so many times to quit or<br>pull the plug? If the mud stops being fun for us because the damage curve<br>has a little blip in it, or because when we try to correct that tiny<br>mathematical anomaly and the PEOPLE we hurt complain, then have we not lost<br>track of why it began at all.....<p>I thought games were for the players to have fun, and for us to have fun in<br>serving them.<br>Was I wrong?<br>

: [Ed: I found this interesting read over at alt.games.everquest ... what a busy group that is ... had never been there before] 

: Welcome To The Player Wimping Guidebook!
: (or how to dry up your mud in no time)

: uking up a mud is surprisingly simple. With a little bit of time and
: dedicated effort to your own stupidity, you too can ruin your mud for the
: players, cause strife beyond belief, and take your mud down a slow spiral to
: implosion from within. The two best ways to do this are Wiping and Wimping.

: For those of you new to being little tin gods, I will be using the following
: definitions:

: 
: ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
: ----

: Terms Used Here:

: Imms, Immortals, Gods: Those who run a mud. These are the admins that build
: or oversee the mud. Sometimes called Dungeon Masters or GMs, DMs, or IMPs.

: Mud: Not the gooey stuff women wrestle in, but a multi-user dungeon. An
: online game where multiple players interact with each other and computer
: generated monsters.

: Mobs: No, not 100 middle-aged women in a store with a big shoe sale! Mob
: refers to computer generated monsters on a Mud.

: Trolls: People who simply like to cause problems and get off on watching the
: resultant fallout and fighting.

: Wiping: is the act of doing a player file wipe. This destroys all player
: information, including hours played, gold collected, equipment earned, and
: all other facets of the character. It may or may not include the player's
: name.

: Wimping: is the act of taking away from a player's skills, spells, or
: effectiveness in some other way, such as reducing weapon effectiveness or
: boosting mobs (computer generated monsters) to an incredible degree. It can
: also refer to the reduction of gold. Wimping is called nerfing or blunting
: in many circles.

: 
: ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
: ----

: Player Wimping A Critical Examination

: Generally done under the rationalization of &quot;mud balancing&quot; or &quot;restoring
: the challenge&quot; the act of wimping players or 'nerfing' is one of the most
: insidious acts one can undertake. Wimping results in more hurt players, and
: more shattered morale for a mud than anything any player could ever
: accomplish. What is worse is that it is done by those who ostensibly are
: tasked with protecting the game and making it a better place to spend your
: entertainment hours. Wimping has destroyed more than one mud that I have
: been on, and has hurt loyal mudders across the world.

: 
: ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
: ----

: Best Intentions:

: Almost without fail, when a mud starts, it starts because a player decides
: the gaming world needs something &quot;friendly and unique&quot; and finds himself in
: a situation where he is not satisfied with how the mud he is on is run. The
: player, now a new Implementor (chief administrator) believes that he can do
: a better job than those whose mud he has left and so he simply starts his
: own. In many instances he is disappointed or sad at the way that players on
: his X-mud have been treated and thinks he can do it better, making an
: environment where people can feel wanted and safe. Indeed the ideal he
: starts with is to become for his players what he wished the gods on his
: X-mud had been for him. So he sets about the task.

: His idealism is in full bloom as he hires a staff of builders and coders and
: installs a couple of gods, (usually friends from his X-mud), and he then
: sets out to make a wonderful new place for people to come and enjoy. He goes
: to great lengths to find out what players want in a mud and does his best
: within reason to accomplish it. As part of this process he puts together an
: Alpha-Test team, (usually a group of players from his old mud), and later he
: opens the mud up for Beta-Testing. During these two formative stages,
: adventuring areas are built, weapons are made, gold is calculated, spells,
: skills and player attributes are decided upon and put in place. It is a hell
: of a lot of work.

: Of necessity Alpha and Beta testing are times of changes, massive equip and
: spell adjustments, boosting and reducing of mobs, gold and whatnot. The
: basics are balanced. Weapons are made to be effective but not insane in
: their power, spells and skills get the same treatment. Mobs are made to be a
: challenge but not suicidal - which is a demoralizer for players. During the
: beta-test time, all that is to come is set up, balanced, and put in place
: for the people who will come to play. When this Herculean task is finished
: the mud is opened up to the public. Sometimes a player-file wipe is done and
: all of the beta tester's characters are destroyed so everyone starts out on
: equal footing. Many times Imps give those kind enough to have been alpha or
: beta testers some incentive like leveling tokens or something for their
: efforts and the time they invested in beta testing. The new mud is on the
: air and everyone is excited!


: The Honeymoon:

: As the mud opens, the gods and builders are visible and helpful, they give
: freely of their time to players with little grudging. The Imms make attempts
: to get people to come try their mud and they are usually responsive to
: players requests. The Imms and builders PLAY their own mud, (as opposed to
: just RULING it) , leveling characters and grouping with those players they
: are there to serve. Imms will sometimes make it known who they are sometimes
: not so as to judge how well the players are enjoying their new creation. In
: short the Imms CARE about how the players feel about the mud, and they are
: more interested in the players than they are in anything else. This period
: can vary in length greatly depending on the personalities involved and just
: how idealistic the new IMP and his gods are about making players happy. It
: is a good time to be in the game for everyone.

: At this stage players are the reason for the mud. The Imms know why they
: went to all this work, it was to make the players happy! And by god they are
: there to do just that... for a while.

: As time goes on however, the mud begins to grow. As may be easily surmised
: so do player requests for interaction and assistance, requests for special
: favors or weapons, demands for change to the basic skill set, and a plethora
: of other demands and expectations that can be expected from the type of
: people drawn to mudding and role playing games in general. At first, the IMP
: and his gods do their best to keep people happy, sometimes giving in to
: truly bad or stupid ideas and even fringe-player demands. It is likely that
: they will give in against their own gut feelings when they do some of these
: things. In their rightly motivated effort to please they sometimes go
: further than they should thus setting themselves up to fail.

: After a while things begin to change for the Imms... not in the mud or with
: the players but within themselves.

: Midlife Crisis:

: Somewhere along the way the gods begin to feel pressured and they begin to
: withdraw. Slightly at first, simply going invisible, but they still talk
: regularly with players. But it does not stop, things slide more and more and
: they find themselves slowly cutting even simple player discussion down. Soon
: the Imms find themselves only talking to their peers. They start to see
: players as a bunch of whiney cheaters who are there simply there to take
: advantage of the generosity offered by the immortal staff.

: Another thing that seems to happen about this time is that the gods begin to
: re-examine things that a year or six months ago were just fine and were
: accepted as normal. For some reason they reach a point where they find fault
: with things that were okay just a month ago. Imms also begin to care less
: and less about the PEOPLE on the mud, those who the mud was originally built
: to serve, and they begin to think more in terms of the CREATION - that is
: their computer-code, damage-tables, or the fact that people seem to be
: actually having too much success by leveling in a quicker manner than the
: gods think is reasonable.

: In short the admins lose sight of the fact that people are having FUN, and
: instead choose to dwell upon the fact that the mud didn't evolve, and
: players didn't play in the way that they had pre-structured in their own
: minds.

: Danger Point:

: It is at the point where the players become secondary to the creation that
: the danger exists. Along with a select group of other gods, (generally the
: ones perceived by players as having earned the rank to satiate their power
: hungry or controlling natures), the IMPs begin to look at changing and
: blunting ESTABLISHED skills spells or weapons. They talk to people who will
: by their nature agree, asking little if any input from the players that will
: be most affected by their choices. After all this is &quot;not their mud&quot; and
: &quot;they didn't work so hard to create it&quot;. The imms also tend not to ask
: others who might disagree. Like generals who believe in their own
: press-releases this self-serving time will cost them later.

: The Imms now go back and revisit some of the 'special favors' they did for
: people. The realize that they made mistakes in trying to kiss ass to those
: they tried to draw to their mud and they start to make adjustments to the
: things that they themselves fucked up in an early attempt to please. Many
: times this is somewhat justified, one or two spells might just be way
: overpowered. These are changed, and the predictable outcry from those
: affected occurs. The imms put up with this, attempting to justify their
: actions, and taking time to try to mollify the people who have been hurt.
: They even apologize and in some cases admit their own culpability. However
: at the same time there is an undercurrent of resentful feelings that the
: players would &quot;whine&quot; so much and &quot;create so many problems&quot; over something
: that was obviously so wrong.

: This sets them up for the mind set wherein the players become even more of
: an enemy. All later complaints are relegated to &quot;whining&quot; or &quot;selfish
: bitching&quot; and when the next round of wimping comes, with its predictable
: outrage the Imms don't try to explain it nearly as well, instead opting to
: be aloof and uncaring or they will blame it on players for 'overusing' an
: item or spell. Some will even blame it on builders or imms who have departed
: and can not defend themselves. The mindset does not abate even later when
: Imms are mucking with things they should not be. At that point they actively
: antagonize players and the 'my mud not theirs' mindset is fully realized. In
: short they set themselves up against the players and so their
: rationalization is that no matter what they do the players will be a bunch
: of whiners...

: What has happened is a marked shift from player centerdness to one of
: worshiping at the alter of their creation - the software program that runs
: the mud. Damage tables become more important than player satisfaction and
: they begin to seek out the most minor of things to change in what was once a
: well established world under the banner of 'making everything equal'.

: As time goes by pressures of all kinds, from the external player complaints
: about other classes to Imms own air-headed want to relegate players to a
: pre-structured jail cell of how the Imms expected people to play or level
: becomes much more important than player happiness and more and more things
: are slated to be wimped; weapons, gold, good-solid established skills or
: spells.. nothing is safe, nothing is sacred.

: Within the players, this produces a natural, rational, and predictable
: reaction. What they counted on today may not be there tomorrow. These gods
: that were so kind and helpful before have now become the adversaries, seen
: as tyrants or people not to be trusted because they have betrayed the
: implied and implicit trust that the players gave them when they decided to
: invest their personal time and play the mud on a regular basis.


: The Death Spiral:

: As the immortals, (and yes I do place full responsibility on the immortals,
: because it is in fact they who have the power to ameliorate things, and the
: responsibility to the mud NOT to do it in the first place), continue to wimp
: players, boost mobs, drop gold gathering abilities, raise prices, and reduce
: weapon effectiveness, players begin to align themselves into two camps. One
: group who &quot;backs the Imms, 'because they know best and wouldn't hurt us'&quot;,
: and one group who feels &quot;betrayed and hurt&quot; by the removal or destruction of
: that which they have worked so hard to obtain.

: The first group, the 'god-backers' seems to break down into three subgroups.
: Before determining how great you are for your wonderful wimping, consider
: the fact that the motivations of those players that appear to be backing you
: may not be as pure as you believe.

: 
: Factionalization Of The Mud:

: Once the wimping begins the mud breaks into little parts. Myopia sets in and
: people begin to lose sight of the fact that once they were all friends and
: having fun playing together. Instead it becomes a power struggle and a
: political infight with groups breaking off into encampments trying to get
: their way. If the IMPS have foolishly surrounded themselves with &quot;yes-man&quot;
: type gods, then this won't carry over into the administration, but if the
: IMP had the forethought to install people as gods who would speak their own
: mind, this factionalization will also occur in the immortal camp as well.

: 
: God backers seem to break down into one of these three groups:

: Self-Preservationists - Probably the largest group on the god-backers team
: are the self-preservationists. They are also the least loyal to your
: position as an Imm bent on wimping. These people are participating in a
: typical human reaction similar to that of the pre-war Germany where the
: populace allowed those in power to take rights and property from others, and
: even SUPPORTED it in the vain and stupid hope that the authorities would
: remember them, and not take similar action against their race or class at a
: later date. As with the people in Germany, this belief of course vanished as
: soon as the authorities turned their interest toward their particular
: minority. It is indeed gratifying to watch self-preservationists become
: enraged and vocal when they get the nerfed as the self-preservationists tend
: to be the ones that have the fiercest and most vociferous outcry when THEY
: are the ones being betrayed by the administrators of the mud. The already
: wimped players will see this as an ironic form of justice for not having
: stood by them when the imms were mucking up their stuff.

: Ass-Kissers - When an established skill or spell is taken from others, a
: very significant portion of those who back you as an Imm are doing so for
: the sole reason that they would blindly agree to any damn thing you did! You
: should already know the kind. These people likely want to ingratiate
: themselves to you because they have their own aspirations for immhood in the
: future and know full well that being buddies with a god, (especially when
: standing up for an unpopular action), will win them approval with you and
: subsequent favors or other consideration or bent rules. It is also important
: to remember that many people who want to cause strife to your mud, (See
: 'Bitchers' in the next section), will pretend to agree with you because its
: the best way that they can think of to be able to SAFELY (to themselves)
: stir the shit with arguments which they know will cause problems and hurt
: others in order to meet their final agenda. Online these people are known as
: trolls.

: Genuine-Believers - There will be a few people who will genuinely and
: honestly believe that what you are doing is right. A person is most likely
: to belong to this group if he agrees with what you are doing and it is being
: done to him. (Although its very important to remember that the Ass-Kissers
: many times will do this even to their own detriment.) Genuine believers may
: believe their points after rational and cerebral introspection, or they may
: simply be blind followers. The fact that you can find people to agree with
: you even if that belief is genuinely held in no way makes what you are doing
: right however.

: 
: In the same way as the god-backers have subgroups, so too do the
: wimping-detractors.

: The Betrayed - Probably the largest group of those who would be labeled
: wimping-detractors are those who rightfully feel betrayed and hurt by the
: immortals. These players have invested very significant periods of time on
: the mud, and have raised themselves up to a certain level of skills and
: spells by hard work and initiative. They have gone to great lengths to get
: the equipment they feel is best, and they have developed a persona and a
: playing style around the items and rules originally supplied to them by the
: gods. They operate within the rules and use the equipment and spells to its
: fullest advantage - as well they should - and then some Imm notices it and
: BAM. These people have a genuine sense of betrayal. That which they were
: allowed to earn is stolen from them by the very Immortals that they counted
: upon to do right by them. They have lost abilities, or had them
: significantly blunted by those who once said &quot;We made this game for you, and
: for your fun.&quot;. Instead those same immortals are now telling them &quot;If you
: don't like it start a new character or your own mud... we know what's best&quot;.
: When the immortals take that attitude it simply reinforces the betrayed's
: feelings and proves him right.

: The Bitchers - There is a certain group of mudders who will always cause
: problems. Wimping is but another excuse for them to attempt to cause strife
: on the mud and to do the best they can to control other people by using the
: unhappiness of the situation to make them do things they might not
: ordinarily do. You will already know these people, as they never ever ever
: have anything positive to say, they spend no time whatsoever trying to make
: people happy or doing good, but instead always make it their business to
: cause shit. They are labeled as trolls in many communities because they do
: nothing more than spoil things for others. Though comprising nowhere NEAR
: the numbers of actually betrayed people, the bitchers do present a
: significant number of wimping detractors. These people should be completely
: ignored by both sides in this battle as they are there for the sole purpose
: of causing problems and inciting unhappiness.

: The Ethical/Moralists - Most certainly the smallest group in the
: wimping-detractors are those who have thought the issue through thoroughly,
: not having taken into account how they were affected, but instead looking at
: how things really are affecting people and determined that the wimping was
: just simply wrong or unjust. These people will make good directed arguments
: which show forethought and a care for players above all else, including the
: sacred damage tables or other garbage that the imps might trot out to
: justify their stance. Of course this pisses off the Imms even more because
: the damage tables and economy tables are now the imms sacred cows, not the
: players but they cant SAY that for obvious reasons. Hell maybe they don't
: even see that in themselves!

: Almost always the Ethical/Moralists people will find themselves ostracized
: or vilified simply for speaking out, and because their arguments make sense,
: they will be seen as a threat to the mud and to the mud by the admins. If
: the Ethical/Moralists are gods on the game they are usually removed or
: chastised for not being a &quot;team player&quot; rather than being allowed to speak
: out, as their arguments are compelling and well directed.


: ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
: ----

: The Effect:

: As you can see factionalization shatters the camaraderie and friendships
: that a good mud will have groomed and encouraged. This downward spiral has
: resulted in the death of more than one mud that I am personally familiar
: with and made a couple others totally not worth the time to play... unless
: of course you simply like to watch people fight. These actions pit friends
: and players against each other in the same way as a civil war pits brother
: against brother or adultery pits spouse against spouse. There can be no
: winners once this occurs, only those who have not lost as much as others. Is
: this what you want to have happen to your mud? Would you like a nice set of
: well balanced tables, damages, leveling times, and the other things you seek
: through wimping, or would you prefer to make 50 to 3000 people happy to play
: on your mud without infighting?

: The above described events comprise a circle where one screw-up feeds off of
: another which feeds off of another until a continuing and destructive
: downward spiral occurs. The spiral stops when one of two things happens,
: either the mud dies because someone with enough power pulls the plug on the
: mud itself out of disgust, or a large portion of the players and dissenting
: immortal staff are purged or quit leaving only those who were in blind
: agreement. The residual players and Imms are battered, bruised and wary from
: the fight. People in this condition are in no mind set to help newbies or to
: recruit new players and this apathy results in a feeling of morbidity that
: takes months to dissipate.

: Basically you've fucked yourself and your mud at this point.

: 
: Solutions and Suggestions:

: So far I have presented the realities of what I opine happens when you wimp
: or wipe your players and/or their equipment. Almost without exception it
: results in pain, strife, fighting, factionalization, forced-deletions,
: players quitting, rules about free expression imposed, and many other
: negative repercussions. So what can you do? Your mud is unbalanced and
: players are whining, your mathematical formulas don't add up the way you'd
: like and you want to change something....

: First re-evaluate. WHY are you considering making these changes, is it
: because players are bitching that one class is better than the other or can
: deal death out to mobs faster? Is it because you're bored and have nothing
: better to do and you feel change for changes sake is good? Is it because you
: have power, and just want to fuck with people? (If so don't bother to read
: any more, just mail me so I never go to your mud. :P)

: Second, look again at what you hope to accomplish and for whom. You likely
: created this game in part to make people happy. It wasn't an exercise in
: programming (well not in most cases anyway) it was to serve the public, do
: do a greater good wasn't it? Or was it so you could stroke your ego? Was it
: because you wanted to have power over people? Were you attracted by the hope
: of power to make them sad to ruin their free-time, and to make their efforts
: worthless? Naw, I didn't think so! If you don't do this wimping will your
: mud fail? Doubtful. Unless you are a total fuck up and put in dozens of
: things that were way to powerful from the start, and didn't sweep them out
: in beta, then your mud will survive without the unfriendliness that wimping
: will bring far better than after you participate in wimping.

: Lastly, is it worth the cost? You are about to lose players and maybe an
: immortal or two. Is this what you want to occur? Are players worth anything
: to you? Will you GET more players in return for the ones you lost when the
: game playing public hears of what a great job of wimping you have done? If
: so have at it, but think... few people come to muds because they have heard
: of how great the balance is, most people come because they hear the gods
: make it a FUN place to play and that the people are friendly. Nerfing begets
: the antithesis of a friendly environment.

: Last Logic:

: I am sure that I haven't covered all potential arguments with the following
: Q&A nor will I try, however you decide to ignore this, I do wish you and
: your player-base luck.

: 
: But Tenny, some of my players are bitching that the classes aren't balanced!

: Yea? when have they not bitched? I know it seems rhetorical, but some
: players will ALWAYS bitch that the classes aren't balanced. Hell if you took
: all classes off your mud except say warriors, and then you copied all of the
: skill set into 4 other named classes, renamed the skills and classes, making
: no adjustments, people would STILL say they weren't balanced. Instead simply
: state up front, classes do not compare. Tell them, &quot;Play the one you like
: best for you, don't judge yourself against others, and if the one class is
: much better make one of them&quot;. (don't then fuck that up by rebalancing
: another class).

: Now IF you are so damn interested in balancing classes, and you feel that
: this is of paramount importance, then they key is to GIVE and not to take.
: GIVE new skill-sets or powers to the ones you feel are weaker. There will be
: some bitching from those who are who don't get something new, or increased
: damage, but that will subside a lot faster and be far less divisive than if
: you steal that which the others have already earned. If you are worried
: about it making it easier to defeat mobs, then make a new area with bigger
: mobs! People will always go for a challenge.

: If you had two knives, one dull and one sharp, would it not make better
: sense to make them equal by sharpening the dull one - not by blunting the
: sharp one?

: Computer generated creatures don't get their feelings hurt if they are
: replaced or some new mob gets some special power. Players do.

: Tenny, I just found out that the Druid Spell 'stick poke' has been
: overpowered since we put it in!
: Lets see if I got this right: You have an established spell that people have
: come to rely upon that you just figured out all this time later was over
: powered? Well then in point of fact it can't be that overpowered can it? If
: it was, you would have seen this class just wiping the floor with the others
: long before this and you would have corrected it within a month of its
: inception. You did not. Therefore your assessment that this is going to mess
: up your mud is fallacious. Had it been that big a deal before, it wouldn't
: have gone for a period of months without being noticed.

: Tenny, I put in some new equipment that makes the other stuff obsolete and
: too high powered in comparison. Now I have to lower the older stuff so they
: will want the new or so that there is more incentive to get it.
: With all due respect, you are setting yourself up for failure. If your new
: stuff is too powerful the answer in not to hurt the players that already
: have the old stuff, its simply to lower the new stuff. You should have
: looked at this before you put in the new items! If you don't lower the new
: stuff, someday this new widget you put in today will look a lot like the old
: stuff you're about to wimp. As for incentive, people will go to great
: lengths to get that one extra damage roll or even just for bragging rights
: (&quot;I got me a big mythril sword and I'm only the third person on the mud to
: have done so!&quot;) So don't worry about it... and if the players don't want to
: get the new thing... so what? Are you trying to stroke your equipment
: building ego or is your goal to make a fun place to mud where people have
: choices? Taking that which players have rightfully earned from them is
: simply wrong.

: Tenny, people are leveling too fast. I had envisioned it talking 3 months to
: make Avatar, and this one guy did it in 2 weeks!!
: So the players are having fun at the expense of how you perceived the mud
: would play? They aren't sticking within your little cage of expectations and
: are not blindly doing things in the way you had envisioned? Uhm, again with
: all due respect SO WHAT? Did you see Jurassic Park? It makes for a good
: analogy. Players are people - People, life itself, can not be boxed into
: your perception of how to act and how to play. Some people mud to get
: millions in virtual gold, some to attain levels, some want one Avatar
: (highest level player) of each class, some come solely for social
: interaction. As long as they are not maliciously hurting each other leave em
: be and let them have fun!

: To punish the average player for the success of your top ten percent players
: is ridiculous. Unless your mud is dropping in players because massive
: numbers of them are telling you 'this twink mud is too easy so I am
: quitting', let them be! They are enjoying your creation as is! You made this
: mud to be fun. People are having fun. THAT should be something you should
: sit back and be proud of not screw around with simply to somehow chase the
: unatainable ideal of making things appear fair, and never for some
: mathematical calculation.

: Tenny, I am in Beta test, and I don't want my players to keep all the stats
: and weapons from our testing period, it wouldn't be fair.
: This is the time where I agree that a Pfile wipe is appropriate. Also Alpha
: and Beta testing is the time for you to make all the mods, wimping, tuning
: and changes you're going to make on the basics. Beta testers should be told
: in advance that they can count on a Pfile wipe. The problem is that most
: IMPS look at normal mud life as an ongoing beta test and find themselves
: continually fucking with established skills and spells. Do it once do it
: right then leave it the hell alone. If you missed some moderate or small
: problem after beta is over and people have come to count on it leave it the
: hell alone. Nobody's gonna get hurt. Also you must give those nice people
: that beta-tested for you some cool incentive to come back when the mud
: opens, a few levels, or even a character that's half way up already, special
: personalized equipment or something else that reflects your thanks for a job
: well done.

: Tenny, I just put in the Mage Spell 'urine pool' and found out that it is
: too powerful, you cant say that I shouldn't reduce it are you?
: Hell no! Though some would argue the point I don't feel I am that stupid.
: When you have a brand new skill or spell make sure your players know that
: you will be making changes as they are warranted. But hold yourself to a
: limited beta period for each item. A month or two at the most. My thesis
: through this entire treatise has been that it is the ESTABLISHED skills and
: spells that you have a moral right not to mess with as people count on them.
: If you put in something new, and people know that its in testing, then they
: also know not to count on it. Once its in and relied upon, its too late.

: Fine Tenny screw you, I will just tell everyone that NOTHING is stable or
: static and that I can change anything I want to anytime and that if they
: cant live with it then they should go to another mud.
: Good! Now were making progress! At least you're finally being honest and
: ethical with your players, even though you give them nothing to count on you
: for - with the exception of change, loss, and pain, at least it is a fully
: informed decision. You have given them all the consideration you morally
: need to at this point. If they bitch after this then too bad. But do know
: this, some people, (those who would be your most loyal 'cheerleaders'), will
: be those who make a mud a long term home. Many measure this commitment in
: years. If you take a stance like this, you will also find the loyalty
: quotient to be fairly low. Nobody wants a long term commitment that
: fluctuates. How would you like to be married to someone that would fluctuate
: in how much they do drugs, commit adultery or beat you?

: Tenny, I am a player and this wimping is happening to my mud, what can I do?
: Hey! You are a PLAYER!?!?!? What are you doing reading this! Go away shoo!
: Shoo! This was written for people a lot better than you, people more wise
: and all knowing, people who KNOW that your ideas suck and that you have no
: right to protest or complain! Go on hit the back button!

: Seriously? Sadly my friend, it is likely you can not do not a damned
: thing... I do NOT think that hiring a good sniper is a really prudent
: solution and no matter how much you are upset, remember this IS a game and
: it is completely insane to take any real life action of any kind against an
: Imm over something as meaningless as mudding or online gaming. Try to write
: well written notes to the Imps, complain publicly but not in a shrill
: manner. Make your arguments using all the facts you can, and include in your
: notes points that they make that you concede. Give them this URL if you
: like. Try to be direct and always be honest. In point of fact tho, its not
: gonna do a damn bit of good most likely. Decisions like this are made
: usually made by people with the idea that players are going to bitch and for
: whom the people who play their games are longer meaningful so their
: happiness no longer drives the Imm staff. If that was the case, they would
: have taken steps to avoid this sort of thing prior to your being upset.

: If it bothers you enough, on either a personal level or on an ethical level
: vote with your feet and leave the game. Let everyone know know why you are
: taking this action, but don't do so with the intent to take others with
: you... that's manipulative and wrong. When you go to your next mud or online
: game, ask to talk to a god or better yet an imp. If one comes to you that's
: a good sign. If they will talk openly and honestly with you about this topic
: that's even better. You're about to make a commitment of some months and
: many hours of your time, I don't think it unreasonable to ask a few pointed
: questions. If they do think it is unreasonable.... do you really wish to
: play there? I would not.

: Closing Thoughts:

: As I close this, it must be more than obvious where I stand on the issue of
: Wimping Players and why. I am empathetic, even sympathetic to a degree to
: what as a Mud-God you are trying to accomplish but I can not support that
: which causes people to be hurt or stolen from. As many are fond of pointing
: out, this is only a game, and as a good friend, Danilo's mother pointed out
: &quot;Don't you play this game to have FUN?!?!&quot;. We as immortals are here for the
: players of our respective muds. We are no more real gods than Mao Tse Tung
: was, despite our power to cause hurt feelings and destroy hours of play on a
: whim.

: Because we posses dictatorial power does not mean we are obligated or even
: free to use it.

: Sadly many of us lose track of the real purpose of what we began our muds
: for. We lose sight of why we left our last mud, and begin to see our mortal
: players as the enemy. Is it any wonder why we offer so many times to quit or
: pull the plug? If the mud stops being fun for us because the damage curve
: has a little blip in it, or because when we try to correct that tiny
: mathematical anomaly and the PEOPLE we hurt complain, then have we not lost
: track of why it began at all.....

: I thought games were for the players to have fun, and for us to have fun in
: serving them.
: Was I wrong?
