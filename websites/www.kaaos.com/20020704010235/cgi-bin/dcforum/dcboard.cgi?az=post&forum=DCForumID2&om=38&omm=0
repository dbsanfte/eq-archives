         <blockquote>
         Reposted from the Death Hole Message Board:<P><i>Kal Mirage  Jan-31-01, 12:54 PM (PST)  <BR>"The Death Hole - A Message" </i><P>Sloshing through ankle deep gore, a small, hunched figure slowly dragged on towards its final goal. Fragments of bone and chunks of flesh floated along atop the fetid red slush. The thick ooze of what was once living, these lost souls now just an afterthought, acted as a symbol for all those who dare enter the pit. A symbol... and a warning.<P>As the hunched figure slowly made its way, every step splashed more foul grime onto its pale, naked flesh. Knowing full well the price of disobeying, the small creature plodded onward, until a dull scream echoing through the stagnant air reached its gnarled ears. With its eyes clamped shut, the messenger listened, and at once knew that it had arrived at its destination.<P>The screaming slowly grew louder. Screams of pain and anguish. Screams of despair and hopelessness. But, superceding all others, were screams of satisfaction and pure pleasure. The small creature knew that this was the pit... the Death Hole.<P>Shadows danced across the barely illuminated Pit, faster than the eye could follow. Figures dancing about, locked in the cruel, harsh battle for survival. One misstep, and you were nothing more than a deposit on the bottom of this foul pit of rancid viscera. <P>The newly deceased littered the Death Hole. Their torn corpses creating small islands where a temporary reprieve from the filth was possible. None rested long though. Rest was impossible when the battle for life, the battle to impress raged on. <P>For most, there was no chance. They were just doomed to the pit, to serve as entertainment for their masters. Their deaths brought laughter, if any response at all. Laughter at their pitiful existence as they were crushed beneath the feet of another, one last look of utter pain and despair as they realize how meaningless their worthless lives really were.<P>The messenger, this small creature, had not believed at first. But as it walked into the light, it knew that it was much worse than even what it had not wanted to believe. Fear overtook its tiny frame as the inhabitants of the pit turned on it, bloodlust written on their black and red spattered faces. Slowly, it backed away, trying to escape the fate it well knew awaited it.<P>Something under the filth caught its heel, toppling it over backwards. Only the figure's chest remained visible above the murky slop which now began filling its mouth. As the Death Hole petitioners rested and watched the wretched little creature choke, it became obvious that it was not just some toy for them to play with. <P>Half seared and half torn into the small creature's chest was a summons. The torn and scarred wording made it clear as to who was being summoned.<P>Confusion, anger, and jealously slowly died into silence. The denizens of the KAAOS Death Hole longingly watched, contempt and loathing showing in their eyes as Seiko and Judas began the long trek out of the Pit's muck and sludge.<P>The silence lasted only momentarily.<P>In its stead, laughter filled the air.<P>As always, the Gods were amused.<P><BR>Kal Mirage<BR>KAAOS<P> <BR>
