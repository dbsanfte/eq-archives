                Slayve - Sir Rellik - Hedron - Azimer<br>
                1996 Champions of the Neverwinter Guilds PVP Tourney</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> The young 
                boy sat next to the old man on the steps of the armor shop in 
                Neverwinter. "Tell us the story again, sir" said the excited young 
                boy, and the gathered crowd of about 15 children echoed his request. 
                "Pleeeeease!" they all shouted. The toothless, sightless old beggar 
                merely laughed, wet his dry lips from his wineskin and sat the 
                lad on his knee and began his tale to the throng of children once 
                more... </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">"These are 
                the tales of legends, boys", said the old man. "The kind you hear 
                passed down from generation to generation. But we live in exciting 
                times, boys, exciting indeed", the old man took another long sip 
                from his wineskin. The wide-eyed children barely breathed, so 
                that they missed none of the story. "This is the tale of the greatest 
                PVP battle the lands have ever known!" he shouted for dramatic 
                effect and the children cheered wildly, but quickly quieted down 
                when he raised his hands. "These events are happening around us 
                right now, and just barely a new moon ago, BDA and KAAOS fought 
                to prove who were truly the best warriors in the realms. MECH 
                teams, UDL teams, ITB teams, Mask teams, OGS teams, and KEF'ers 
                all fell before the might of KAAOS and BDA. None stood in their 
                way, and when the smoke cleared on all the battlefields, there 
                were two decisive victors, and no doubt the two most powerful 
                Guilds had made it to the final battle". The old man heard the 
                children whispering excitedly, and he smiled as he knew he had 
                their complete attention, as he began his legendary tale... </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">"It was a 
                cool, cloudless day in the Neverwinter Woods. High noon. After 
                the punishment of the Night Mask team by KAAOS, and the destruction 
                of the once powerful ITB's at the hands of the deadly BDA, the 
                two most powerful PVP forces in Neverwinter would clash this day. 
                The Dreadlord of KAAOS, Sir Rellik, entered the North East woods 
                on his jet black stallion, letting his blonde, flowing mane fall 
                around his shoulders as he dismounted. The Demon God, Slayve, 
                seemed to appear out of the thin air from amongst the shadows 
                of the trees, his obsidian flail at the ready. Azimer rode in 
                on his Arabian steed, dismounted, and with a wave of his hand 
                the creature shimmered and disappeared into thin air. The False 
                Prophet of KAAOS arrived last, fashionably tardy. Cloaked in dour 
                gray and holding his Twisted Cross, Hedron waited impatiently 
                for the bloodshed to begin." Another pull from his wineskin and 
                the old man continued... </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">"The Drow 
                team of Kh0lari, Sylverion, Modalex, and Sagx seemed to ooze gracefully 
                from the shadows and were ready to attack in the blink of an eye. 
                The fight would be amongst giant scorpions and deadly remhoraz'es. 
                Slayve entered first and quickly ran to the left and Globed. In 
                came Sagx, Sir Rellik, Modalex with no incidents, and each globed 
                in turn. Sylverion appeared in the midst of the Remo's and fate 
                played it's fickle hand. Sylverion's appearance seemed to startle 
                the giant worm-like beasts and one attacked Sylverion and it's 
                deadly maw was wrapped around Sylverion's torso before he could 
                even react. In one long gulp, Sylverion was gone. The Gods of 
                KAAOS laughed! Yet they knew the battle was far from over. Fumbles, 
                Stink Clouds, and holds flew as the BDA'ers tried to overcome 
                their one man deficit. Slayve and Azimer cornered Modalex from 
                the others and quickly set about pummeling him. He was nearly 
                dead as he Dimension Door'd away to catch his breath. Slayve quickly 
                followed with a DD of his own, as he would not be denied his kill. 
                Meanwhile, Kholari came under the effects of Rellik's Hold spell 
                and things looked grim until Sagx freed his Held companion. Hedron 
                cast Lightning at Sagx and Kh0lari, but both Globes were still 
                intact. Sagx and Kholari quickly surrounded Hedron and started 
                battering him with their deadly drow magic. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Hedron staggered 
                free and headed for the gravely wounded Modalex. He would get 
                one kill in before his own demise, he vowed. As Kholari ran back 
                to Hedron, Azimer and Slayve once again surrounded Modalex and 
                repeated their deadly assault on the wounded Drow. Hedron, sensing 
                his death was near, unleashed a final devastating blow to Kholari 
                just as the drow sent him to the gate. No sooner had Hedron fallen, 
                than Azimer delivered the killing blow to Modalex. Kholari now 
                sorely wounded tried to Hold Slayve, Azimer and Rellikk but failed. 
                After an ill placed attack by Slayve, Sir Rellik's nine inch serrated 
                dagger ended Kholari's time in the battle and the Gods smiled, 
                now knowing it was but a matter of time. Sagx sent a Lightning 
                Bolt through Slayve and Rellik, but they retaliated with magic 
                of their own and Sagx ran for cover under their deadly assault.</font> 
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The chase 
                was on! Sagx's guerilla takes proved effective for a few rounds, 
                but once surrounded, he was quickly overwhelmed. Azimer, Rellik 
                and Slayve battered him down and in a final scream of "KAAOS!!!", 
                Sagx's bloody body was sent gateward and the Gods of KAAOS stood 
                victorious!" </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The children 
                remained silent for a second more, then let out a boisterous, 
                wild cheer. They jumped up and down and started a "mock PVP" amongst 
                themselves. They laughed and shouted as the images of the legendary 
                battle were still fresh in their minds. The young boy on the old 
                man's lap merely looked at him, "What happened then?" he asked 
                innocently. The old man took the boy from his knee and raised 
                his weary bones to stand. "That is a question which only the future 
                may know the answer to. There shall be other struggles and there 
                shall be other warriors to test the mettle of KAAOS in the future, 
                and other tales shall be told about those battles too. Be patient 
                young one, the best is yet to come." said the old man as he picked 
                up his wineskin. The boy pondered a moment, and jumped up excitedly, 
                "Thanks mister!" he yelled and bolted to where his friends were 
                still playing. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">From beneath 
                his hooded cloak, the old man's mouth formed into a sinister grin 
                as he stood upright, dropped the wineskin to the ground and sight 
                returned to his eyes. He pulled the hood back and anyone who would 
                have been watching from the shadows would have seen Doc Krypto 
                there, laughing, and reveling in the glory of KAAOS.</font></p>
