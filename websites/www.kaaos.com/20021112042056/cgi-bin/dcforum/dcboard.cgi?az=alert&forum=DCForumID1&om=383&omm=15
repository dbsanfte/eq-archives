I don't have a few years to waist my time on a pack of high "quality", short fuse, nose in the air, lost "gods" of the internet! Anyone can be quality players in any game if they spend time gaining exp. Not just a good amount of time but enough time to know the game and its timing. Knowing how much time it takes to put down any monster and how many people are needed. It is all about numbers in Shadowbane by Wolfpack. Wolfpack designed the game to have hundreds of players in one battleground. Why join a guild that has a long waiting list if you can join one in a few days and be on your way to slaughtering the one with a long waiting list. What lovely vengeance indeed! Nobody like to be misjudged.

In Ultima it was how you used your time in pvp. Since there can never be more than a few characters on the screen at a time. If you were a fighter, you better have a long range weapon. A mages best friend would be the freeze spell. Now if you have a good reflect item and a hiding item you could win any mage. If I knew a combo was coming all I would do is put that hiding item on. If the item was not found on a monster they can be bought on ebay. It was so much fun using the items instead of waisting a character getting the hiding skill.  

Knowing that I can buy my skill with an item just like buying a deadly poisoned katana or getting my newbie sword dped for a price. Why would I want to wait a whole year to join a lifeless guild? It is not real life that is at stake.  You can now get a quality character that can be bought at a price from UO. What has the world come to when pixels cost money?
