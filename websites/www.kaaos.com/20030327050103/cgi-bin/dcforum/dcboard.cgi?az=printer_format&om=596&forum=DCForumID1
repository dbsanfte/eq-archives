I was waiting for someone to respond to this topic. <P>Here they say this at the newsletter, "Much to the dismay of many First Amendment fans, Google caved, removing the offending pages from its index."<P>Here in the U.S.A., there can be evil guilds like KAAOS to lurk in the internet. Why not be happy about that at least? I will make a top 10 list of stuff that makes me happy soon.<P>
