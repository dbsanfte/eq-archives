By common word linking you are saying you get a laugh out of supermodels and "something else" off of midgets. It figures you scab. Go bleed your puss elsewhere.<P><BR>SangDraxx<BR>KAAOS<BR>The Serpent Lord<P><BR>

Laposn, Balor's lame post was better than any post you have ever made. This is NOT a compliment to Balor's post. It's funny how you think your all that and a bag of chips but I've seen flaming bags of shit that were smarter and more eloquent than you.<P>-Fizzle<BR>Your God
