<blockquote>Been a long time.  Figured I'd stop in here and see what server you guys were playing on in SB.  Is SB worth it?  Is it interesting or mindless like other PvP games have been in the past few years?  <P>Also, who the fuck is this Geo guy?  Its amazing the abuse he suffers, yet he always comes back for more.<P>Morpheus/Malignancy/Eclipso<P>P.S. Just for the hell of it, you guys might want to check out our DSO server based upon the NwN game engine.

Heh heh, I knew Nancy couldn't stay away forever ;p <P>Some of us are playing SB, the rest of us are lazy ;p SB can be fun if you take it for what it's worth. There's some cool shit in the game. It's not a good PvP game though. They missed the mark. They thought that if they made the game around player conflict that they would automatically have a good PvP game I guess. Someone forgot to mention that it requires a good combat system to have a good PvP game.......actually it was mentioned to them, they just didn’t take it to heart. <P>Too many current games and games in development are buying into the bullshit that mass combat, alone, is where it’s at. They try to think of ways to make mass combat better but forget the important details, like....oh, I dunno, making individual classes PvP viable. Until someone realizes that they have to start developing their game from the end game (max character levels) and balancing PvP from an individual character standpoint first and then fleshing the game out from there around that foundation, there won’t be another good PvP game. <P>Azmodion<BR>KAAOS

I decided to give a SB a chance and I played a few hours last night on Scorn.  The game seems like it has potential (quite a bit better than I had expected).  If they could weed out the bugs in the next few weeks and cut down on the lag, it may be worthwhile - so long as the PvP is challenging of course, which I've heard mixed opinions on.<P>Btw, I saw someone running around named Blayloch.  Coincidence or is that the Blayloch from Kaaos?<P>EC<P>P.S. Geo - It only took me about 30 seconds of browsing messages around here to see that you Kaaos's bitch of the month.   I expect that you will disappear eventually, into obscurity.<P>

Best keep waiting for a better game like Planetside that has even more potential and flexibility. Potential with better strategy and does not rely on patience with lag while trying to gain a level. Flexibility with a character that can not change professions. <P>I expect you will fall victum to the "dark and loomy" phenomenon that brings retards like you together.<P>It was such fun being able to chat with you, NOT!

Nancy always was, and still is, my bitch.<P>It makes me laugh even now thinking about how badly I broke him by kicking his ass a few times in EQ.<P>That's right, Nancy - I haven't forgotten how you flipped out, spammed me with tells while hiding in game for weeks, and eventually tried to convince me you were going to use your "l33t FBI job" to find me and come shoot me. ROFL!<P>Still waiting on that, by the way.<P>Ah, well. Thanks for the memories, you pathetic dipshit. ;p<P><BR>Still laughing at you,<P>Joker

Good to hear from you!  I thought you died of some Herpes related illness?  Oh, it was bells-palsy wasn't it?  Heh, that must have been enjoyable <img src="http://www.kaaos.com/htdocs/dcforum/Images/bigsmile.gif">  <P>I believe that time must have faded your demented memory, Joker, for if you recall correctly, it was I that killed you every single time in EQ and I'm far too intelligent to resort to meaningless real-life threats.  If you have screenshots showing otherwise, please post them.<P>Also, I never worked for the "FBI".  Not sure where you got that garbage.  You must be thinking of someone else.  I did work for the United States Attorney's Office, but thats besides the point.

You're still nothing but an idiot and a liar, which is no surprise.<P>I know you never worked for the FBI, you clueless dipshit. (Man, it's boring dealing with dumbasses like you.) I knew it when you first tried to convince me of it, as I laughed my ass off at you. I know everything about you that I need to know. See my first paragraph if you're unclear on it.<P>In fairness, maybe you've blocked all that out, or mentally reconstructed it a la your old pal Gaterage. I understand that's one defense mechanism that worthless pukes like you use so that they can live with themselves. ;D<P>But I think you remember it very well, and I'm gratified that you have to live with the knowledge of what a retarded weakling you are.<BR> <BR>The simple fact is that you tried to tell me you'd use your supposed super-secret FBI job to track me down and shoot me. Maybe you were drunk. Maybe you were off your meds. Maybe daddy touched you again that day and you needed to lash out. I don't know why you said it; I just know you did.<P>And let me tell ya - it was definitely the most laughable, the most pathetic, the most unmitigatedly Dweebified real-life threat I've ever seen one of you nutless online victims use - and it's the ONLY reason I remember you at all. So hey, at least you can take heart - you made your mark!<P>You never killed me a single time in EQ, and that's pretty fucking pathetic on its own considering the PvP in that game. All you ever did - after I dusted you a few times - was hide, obsess on me with weeks worth of tells and anally-fixated posts (wonder if Hed has those archived... that was some FUNNY shit watching you rant on and on about gay rape), and lie a lot.<P>Then, of course, you disappeared because you realized you were never going to be anything other than a laughingstock.<P>Now, like so many others we've seen here, you have completed the Loser's Cycle, by reappearing when you think enough time has passed for people to forget how full of shit you are.<P>And like all the others, you're wrong. But then I'm sure you're used to that.<P>The fact that you think I might save four- or five-year-old screenshots of killing some nobody is hilarious. You were the one obsessed with ME, Nancy. As much as you'd like to think otherwise, you were never anything more than Pitiful Loudmouthed Geek #76432 to me, except when you distiguished yourself with the FBI stuff, of course. LOL...<P>Idiots rarely understand when they are out of their league. You didn't understand it then, and you obviously still don't, so let me try to help you with some free advice: shut the fuck up, fade back into the meaningless masses, and learn to live with being a Nothing. It might sting a bit at first, but you'll hate yourself less in the long run.<P>Hugs,<P>Joker<P>

Apparently Joker took offense to my comment about his Herpes.  Poor kid - he should know better than to have sex with crackwhores.<P>Joker, I unfortunately do not have time to reply in detail to your nonsense, but you know very well how many times I killed you in EQ and perhaps thats why you are so angry.  You also know that you never killed me.  I, also, did not save any screenshots of those days, so the point is moot.<P>As for the "sodomy" commentary, I admit that I made many posts referring to me sodomizing you.  I like the word sodomy and I enjoyed the act every time I gave it to you.<P>Take care :)<P>EC<P><BR>

Nancy didn't stick around long after I shamed him, except to grope at my jock in tells and on the boards for a while. I don't think he ever had a character higher than level 20 or so.<P>I do recall how he whined about his lowbieness when he wouldn't deathmatch me (the biggest talkers never will DM), now that I think about it. <P>I doubt he ever saw 20,000 copper, let alone 20,000 plat.<P>But since you mention it, that loot screenie is the only EQ shot I *do* have saved somewhere. Maybe I'll dig it up and post it. ;D
