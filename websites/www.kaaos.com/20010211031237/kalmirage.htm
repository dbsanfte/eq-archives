                moved slowly through his new home, a grim smile crossing his face 
                as he surveyed his new surroundings. The steel grey stone walls, 
                the dark torch-lit hallways, and the shadowy faces of his brothers 
                and sisters welcomed him to his new home. Absently, he touched 
                his forearm and winced as his fingers brushed against the brand 
                that marked him. They had saved his life and now they offered 
                him a place to call home and other beings who would be his family. 
                Looking down at his forearm, Mirage's smile disappeared as he 
                examined the mark of the Bond.</font></font></p>
              <p><font color="#999999">The mark of House ITB. </font></p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <dl> 
                <dd><font color="#999999">Shrugging off his leathery, silver lined, 
                  pitch black cloak, Mirage thought back to this days happenings, 
                  and with those thoughts, came doubt. For the last three years, 
                  his brothers and sisters of the Bond had sheltered him, taught 
                  him, and trained him, his loyalty had never faltered. Mirage 
                  was in the Bond and the Bond with in Mirage. Shaking his head 
                  slowly, visions began to return to him.. </font></dd>
              </dl>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p><font color="#999999">...Merculus spoke a quick phrase, spitting 
                out the final syllables of his spell. The grey skinned figure 
                dove aside as the lightning bolt sizzled past his falling body. 
                Mirage rolled back to his feet, speaking the arcane words of protection 
                his brothers had taught him. Taking the great hammer from his 
                belt, he spun towards his attacker.</font></p>
              <p><font color="#999999">Merculus laughed dryly at the figure before 
                him. Knowing that this boy was no match for his powers, he sat 
                back and watched. He fingered the weapon in his hands, an almost 
                nonchalant look on his face as his eyes met with the boy who's 
                soul he was about to take.</font></p>
              <p><font color="#999999">Speaking slowly, muttering words of power, 
                Mirage drew closer to his attacker, his ignorance shielding from 
                the fear he should be feeling. As he prepared to launch his first 
                offensive, a searing pain ripped through his being, shattering 
                his protective spells, leaving him stunned. Glancing upwards, 
                Mirage saw nothing in front of him, nothing except the shimmering 
                of some sort of magic. Falling to his knees, he fought to turn 
                around, to protect himself from the killing blow that was sure 
                to follow.</font></p>
              <p><font color="#999999">Laughing openly now, Merculus grinned from 
                ear to ear as he watched the scarlet lifeblood of the boy in front 
                of him run down his back. A hint of white, the white of bone, 
                between the torn flesh, proved the strength of the KAAOS God. 
                Raising his weapon with ease, he prepared to claim the soul at 
                his hands, in the name of KAAOS.</font></p>
              <p><font color="#999999">As Merculus brought his flail high over 
                his head, the twang of a bow, the twang of many bows, halted his 
                killing stroke. Turning he watched a flight of a dozen arrows 
                cascade through the air towards his wide open body. He looked 
                back to his prey, then back to the arrows and sighed. He spoke 
                again, his magic surrounding him, shielding him as arrow after 
                arrow shattered against the invisible barrier.</font></p>
              <p><font color="#999999">Growling, Merculus kicked the kneeling 
                form in front of him and spun back to his new threat. Growling 
                again, streams of flame streamed from his fingertips and bolts 
                of pure energy lanced towards his hunters. Knowing that he would 
                be hard-pressed after expending much of his strength, he let with 
                loose all of his power.</font></p>
              <p><font color="#999999">Mirage slumped down momentarily, then began 
                struggling to his feet as screams of agony cut through his ear 
                drums. Standing shakily, he saw his attacker massacring six tall 
                figures. The lone figure was taking on six men, and he was only 
                at half strength! Mirage stood in awe of his power, captive to 
                his might, entranced by his strength. Then he saw the two hidden 
                figures moving through the shadows, swords in hand, nearing his 
                attacker. He knew he should flee, that he would quickly be dispatched 
                in his weakened form, but he also realized he should be dead. 
                Very dead. Looking back towards Merculus, envy of his power in 
                his eyes, Mirage attacked.</font></p>
              <p><font color="#999999">Merculus wearily laughed at the charred 
                and broken bodies laying in front of him, thinking to himself.. 
                &quot;Shit. Only seven souls? I must be tired.&quot; Hearing a 
                scream come from almost right on top of him, he dove headlong 
                out of the way. A blade slashed right where his head would have 
                been, but cut only air.</font></p>
              <p><font color="#999999">Laying on his hands and knees, nearly exhausted, 
                Merculus watched his prey move towards these two men. His eyes 
                met Mirage's momentarily and this time, Merculus could not take 
                his eyes off of this boy. He saw such hatred in those eyes, such 
                contempt, such blood-thirst, and.. such Envy. He knew right away 
                that this boy wanted power. Finally breaking free of his daze, 
                Merculus realized that the fight had ended. The boy in stood in 
                front of him, blood spattered all of his face. A puddle of crimson 
                began to gather around his feet from the gaping wound on his back 
                and his knees looked as if they would buckle any moment.</font></p>
              <p><font color="#999999">Mirage said nothing as he fell. Then all 
                went dark around him. When he awoke, he was weak, but healed and 
                the KAAOS God, Merculus was no where to be seen. </font></p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <dl> 
                <dd><font color="#999999">He woke from his dreamlike trance and 
                  shook his head. The Bond had claimed how powerful they were, 
                  yet with all of his training, Mirage was no match for this God. 
                  All he could think about was how much he wanted that power. 
                  And with those thoughts, his loyalty to House ITB began to fade.</font></dd>
              </dl>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p><font color="#999999">As the months passed, Mirage began to grow 
                distant from those he had called family. He began to train on 
                his own, staying away from the place he used to call home. Somehow 
                he always knew where to find those he sought. He always knew where 
                to find KAAOS and he met with them willingly.</font></p>
              <p><font color="#999999">This continued for weeks, until his family 
                began to grow suspicious of him. Mirage knew that the time had 
                come. House ITB had offered him a place to stay, a place to learn, 
                but they could only teach so much. They had not even come close 
                to rivaling the power of those of KAAOS he had met. Mirage knew 
                that his quest for power would always end in the same spot. The 
                KAAOS Hell Hole.</font></p>
              <p><font color="#999999">Taking a dagger from belt, he brought the 
                blade to his forearm. Staring directly at the mark of House ITB 
                upon him, he ground the length of the blade into his skin, and 
                snarled as the blade bit into his flesh. Moving the dagger back 
                and forth, blood streaming down his arm and between his fingers, 
                he systematically flayed the marked skin from his arm. Tossing 
                the dagger aside and wrapping a bandage around his forearm, Mirage 
                left his home behind. Left his family behind.</font></p>
              <p><font color="#999999">Left the Bond behind. </font></p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p><font color="#999999">His power grew quickly over the next few 
                weeks, and he was &quot;welcomed&quot; into the KAAOS Hell Hole. 
                Taking on the prefix &quot;Kal&quot; -meaning King and God in 
                high common-, Mirage found out the truth. The truth that his old 
                family had hid from him. The truth that House ITB was weak and 
                that they could never match nor rival the power of KAAOS. Everything 
                they had told him had been bullshit and he felt no remorse about 
                his betrayal. &quot;Let them rot in their cesspool of stagnation 
                and under-achievement,&quot; he thought. Shrugging, he strode 
                away, in search of blood. </font></p>
