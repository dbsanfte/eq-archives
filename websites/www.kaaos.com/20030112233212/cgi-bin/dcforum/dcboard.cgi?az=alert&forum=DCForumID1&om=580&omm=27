----------------------------------------------------
A few of us spent excessive time testing the PvP viability of the 3rd edition rules of NWN. I agree with Kal when he said that all this recreation is a bunch of crap. Don’t get me wrong, I think NWN is a great game for a computer version of table top AD&D. The toolset, the GM controls, the graphics, etc.....Everything is by far superior to anything that has come before it in that regard. Additionally, I would love to see the communities of old games like DSO, oNWN and the like be recreated (not because I thought they were great communities in and of themselves but rather because they were great to torment ;p). 

However, and this goes beyond NWN, the 3rd edition rules are NOT made for PvP. As a matter of fact they go a long way towards fucking up PvP. When the 3rd edition rules were created AD&D rules were dummied down to make it “easier” for people to understand and more “action” oriented. The problems with 3rd edition rules go WAY beyond “time stop”. Barbarians, Rogues, and Monks have some SERIOUS issues as does the Sorcerer class. Saves are based off your stats. Rogues can select a feat which allows their to hit to be based off their dex which also affects reflex saves among other things. Monks are like fully magic resistant. Sorcerers are the xgm version of real PvPers of oNWN. Barbarians hit way too fucking hard. AC is fucked up, saves are fucked up (to the extreme)....The list goes on and on and on. The bottom line is the 3rd edition rules are fucking GAY. 
 
If NWN was created with the 2nd edition rules I would have been as happy as a pig in shit, there would have been an endless supply of PvP worlds and communities.
