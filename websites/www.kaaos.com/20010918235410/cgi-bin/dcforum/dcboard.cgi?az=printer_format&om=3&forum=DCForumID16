<blockquote>
Jesus Fucking Christ, how anal.<P>I can understand some of it, to avoid PC-types having shitfits about their kiddies' virgin little eyes even though the game is rated MATURE(Tug McGroin... rofl), but most of that stuff is just absurd.<P>Hell, are they gonna tell me "Jokr" is too derivative of the Batman character Joker, or Private Joker from "Full Metal Jacket" and make me fucking change it? With all those ridiculous rules you can find a way to disallow almost ANY name. I can think of 20 or 30 high-level people on TZ right off the top of my head that violate those rules - people who have spent a year or two developing a character that will now be renamed if those rules are enforced.<P>Thousands of people have persistent online handles by which they are known from game to game. This is IMPORTANT to people - much more important than Verant's futile attempts at maintaining an RP atmosphere in the game through name control. But hey... who cares what the customers want and pay for if the Guardians of the Vision decide otherwise, right?<P>God damn it, SB... hurry up. And don't suck. ;p<P>Joker

They don't even pretend to follow their own rules. Note the names of the bankers in Firiona Vie, among lots of other examples.<P>Joker
