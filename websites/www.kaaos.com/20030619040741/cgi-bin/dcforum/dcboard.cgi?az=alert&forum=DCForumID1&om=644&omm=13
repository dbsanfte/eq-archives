"The only way that senerio could play out is if the three people who were disabled were E-Cloaked. An item, back in the day, that allowed a significant advantage to the person wearing it. Unless, of coarse, that fight was in Southwall... maybe that's why I never saw you fucks. The members of K'wuss were certainly good pvp'ers in thier day, in that game, but citing a win where the items being worn made more difference then the skill of the players is disturbing, at best."

I will start by saying I did not witness this fight nor do I know much about it. That being said, you obviously do not know near as much as you think you do about PvP in NWN. My first assumption of your post is that you must be thinking because Azmo said they were incapacitated by spells that they were "held", and even if they were you did not need an e-cloak to survive being held. The simple matter of npc maniupulation (which everyone thought they knew how to do) was of vital importance and unless your opponents put the disabled people between the npc and themselves they could survive for the entire duration. He also did not mention at what point the battle was at, the current status of everyone's globes or if scrolls were involved in the fight. All of that had to be taken into account.

Incapacitated-they could have been fumbled, or simply in stinking clouds as well so the e-cloak would have not had to been worn to avoid death. What if Krynal had taken out npcs in the vincinty of the incapacitated characters (providing they were held or gagged). If he had done that then the opponents (SUSANS remember) would have had to have dragged npcs to them all while avoiding whatever it was Krynal was doing. Let's face facts here, 99 times in a hundred this scenario is not going to play out well for anyone but if any group could have done it then KAAOS was sure to be the group. The battle spot would have also had great impact on how this played out. KAAOS, and especially the ARKs, loved to fight out in the NW Woods. That place was nasty as hell and the SUSANs might have been trying to thin the npc ranks themselves before trying to finish off Krynal. No matter how you hate to admit it and despite your best attempts at disregarding what happened, the simple fact is that KAAOS was feared and they intimidated people. Live with it. I imagine you didn't see KAAOS much because you were wallowing around in the sewers thinking you knew what the hell you were doing while the real PvP took place in the woods.
