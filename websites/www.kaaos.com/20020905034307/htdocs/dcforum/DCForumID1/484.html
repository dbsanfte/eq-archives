         <blockquote>
         I am aware that some Kaaos still play Sullon Zek, therefore, I thought this board might like to see the report I sent out recently.<P>Solutions for the Future of PvP in EQ<BR>by Richard Gagliano<BR>Part 1, Introduction<P>Forward:  I am opening myself up to public comments on public boards, feedback via e-mail, and various criticisms.  This report is being forwarded to all major PvP boards related to Everquest, as well as developers concerned with PvP in Everquest.  I can be reached at rich_gagliano@hotmail.com.<P>Everyone is always pointing out problems, but not offering solutions; it's easy to point out problems, but difficult to pin-point their solutions.  This appears to be a bit of a problem in our oft pessimistic world.  Until now I have never endeavored to work for change in the realm of online role-playing games; but until now, I have never seen a game under the condition of having the greatest potential of its like in history, and which has failed to fully use it.  I must be careful about the context under which I claim such a game contains problems though, for this post is entirely a PvP post: written by a PvPr for all PvPrs who are interested in Everquest as a PvP-game and those who make such games for this community of player.  These are viable solutions for the future of PvP in Everquest, upon which my suppositions (shared by the majority of people in the PvP community at large) answer problems thus related.<P>Firstly, as I stated, the PvP community and those who cater to them are the audience of this report, for who else would have an interest in it is beyond me.  Therefore, with the knowledge that V.I. of Sony cares about the PvP community, I will continue.  For the makers of Everquest must be aware that there is a viable PvP market out there of which they have hardly touched!  Games such as Neverwinter Nights of AOL, Dark Sun Online, and Meridian59 paved the way for online, multi-player, fantasy role-playing games, specifically games of medieval settings reminiscent of qualities such as authored in Lords of the Rings, Wizard's First Rule, Magician Apprentice, and Dragons of Autumn Twilight to name a few; games which were largely evolved out of the original AD&D game and evoked a fantastic view of their worlds replete with medieval settings.  Games such as Asheron's Call, Dark Ages of Camelot, Ultima Online, and most importantly Everquest--the most highly detailed and evolved virtual world ever in a great tradition of gaming!  (As a note, I wouldn't classify games such as Stars Wars Galaxy or Anarchy Online herein).<P>What V.I. does wrong in PvP games can be stated as quite simple and quite complex, and both are true.  What is simple to identify is that you have made the greatest massive multi-player online role-playing PvE game in history.  Note--you made the greatest PvE game in history; but have you truly made the best PvP game in history? The answer is sadly no; and I say sadly because this game has the potential to be the greatest online PvP game as well.  So the problem is simple--identifying the area of the market Everquest neglects.  The complex problem can be stated thus then:  How do we get the majority of the PvP community to play Everquest, without recreating an entirely new game?<P>For the traditional PvP community is mainly divided in games such as Ultima Online, Dark Ages of Camelot, Asheron's Call, and Everquest (while some of the community remains idle waiting for a better game).  Everquest has only four PvP servers, and therefore a very small portion of this community and viable market.  Based upon this information it can be ascertained that we need to apply solutions to Everquest PvP to make the game more successful in "that realm of gaming," and at the same time not compromise the integrity and politics of the EQ servers which already exist.<P>It is very possible that these new Everquest PvP-designated servers would be premium servers, similar to the Legends series being introduced, although for different reasons and probably not as costly; this all depends upon the belief that this game can be a huge PvP success, and the amount of time and resources that will be invested into it.<P>So I'll now dive into the subject matter, having discussed the political issues of balancing PvP in Everquest, by discussing the topic of combat.  For the topic of combat is essentially what PvP is entirely about.  When dealing with game mechanics issues, the time-tested methods are the most reliable gaming systems for future considerations, as a general rule.  The AD&D gaming system, evolved now into its third edition, is an excellent source to parallel a set of gaming rules upon, being a large part of the creative and mechanical force behind most such games of the genre to which it greatly inspired the birth of.  For its formulas are tried and tested beyond most other systems by time and a player-based larger than any one online game (a good indication of what this genre has to offer).  Past and current games as varying as Chess and Ultima Online will also be used to draw various PvP perspectives upon.  The question is, how can we change the mechanics of combat in Everquest to better balance them, without changing the game itself.<P><BR>

         Solutions for the Future of PvP in EQ<BR>by Richard Gagliano<BR>Part 2, Melee Combat in Everquest: Defensive Overview<P>At the heart of combat, dealing specifically with melee, is the Armor Class.  This figure is the greatest determinant for how often you will get hit in combat, how much damage you will take as a result, and thus chancing the interruption of spellcasting (when this might apply).  It has been noted at the most recent Dallas Fan Faire, in the PvP talks, that there is a disparity between melee combat between "casters" and "tanks" in Everquest.  The reason I'm mentioning AC (Armor Class) is because it is, quite simply, the biggest reason for this disparity.  With the greatly increased damage caps and rates of attack due to items and abilities introduced into EQ throughout the years, the AC of casters has not been made to compensate.<P>Examples in the AD&D AC systems can be used to see the weaknesses of Everquest's system to a certain extent, allowing a doorway for solutions to be presented.  Firstly, most items in the AD&D system are created by spellcasters.  This means that most items in that system are usable by spellcasters, as well as whomever they choose to make them for, but in Everquest items are very class specific, to the point of obsession.  On your average EQ "blue" server this is all well and fine, but for the purposes of practical PvP it is more advantageous to mimmick the AD&D item rules in this case to a larger extent.  Examples are Rings and Cloaks of Protection in AD&D, which give equivalent amounts of resistance and AC to every class.  In cases it's true that AD&D casters made epic weapons, shields and armor, but it is likewise true they made staves and robes for themselves the likes of which even rivaled such weapons and armor on as many occassions.  Another consideration are Bracers of Defense, which offer casters in AD&D AC comparable to even Full Plate Armor types.  Yet in Everquest, this is strangely lacking, in consideration of the games odd and unique PvE balance.  But when appealing to the PvP market, you must consider PvP balance first, and realize that even with this method implemented, it wouldn't ruin PvE in Everquest for the same reasons it doesn't ruin PvE in AD&D--it's been tested and not found wanting.  (Further rules will be brought forth to show why this would not imbalance PvE later, for fundamental game design purposes).<P>The crucial things to realize here are that magical bonuses are not as class-biased in a more balanced environment, and that balancing the items would not hinder monster manipulation in the game to a large extent.  An influx of new items into Everquest created a disparity between "melees" and spellcasters in close-range PvP, and an influx of new items could likewise fix the problem easily.  Since these items would change the politics and integrity of blue servers (non-PvP servers), they would have to be introduced into new and/or existing PvP servers.  There is one other annoying factor in Everquest PvP that this would change.<P>In most PvP games, to the great dissatisfaction of many, the common result of this problem is unanimous.  Casters spend most their time running from melees, using movement bugs to help them get off spells in Everquest combat, such as water bugs, levitation bugs, "run-up-zone-wall bugs," various twitch-related movements, and "regain" bugs to name a few, in attempts to get off spells.  This solution would partially remove this nasty result of the close range melee disparity.<P>For traditionally wizards can use things such as divination spells and scrying devices; they could use spells such as Fly, Blink, Dimension Door, and Teleport (from AD&D); and also through a greater range of sight, they could use range to their advantage more.  Since this is not possible in online role-playing games for technical reasons, you need less disparity in the AC of spellcasters and melee-types to counter this lack of their ability to use their knowledge and special abilities which impart to them more balance in combat.  And let's not fail to mention spells such as Shield, Stoneskin, Ironguard, and Protection from Evil (also from AD&D), which were designed to give the powerful and well prepared casters more protection.  All these arguments thus are brought forth to show that this is the most viable solution.  Adding new items into the game, or changing the base amount of AC each class gains are the only viable solutions here.<P>The other options of course are to reduce the rate of attack, the amount of damage being done in melee combat, and/or remove items from the game, all of which are more difficult solutions, which would disrupt gameplay in the PvE environment on a larger scale and be less effective on almost every level of gameplay.  There is also a suggestion to create items that increase spellcasting times.  Unless such items gave significant improvement to casting time though, they would not be as effective in end-game PvP in Everquest.  The reason for this is because the more effective spells such as DOTs and Lures take longer to cast, thus requiring the ability to "tank" longer.  Ultimately it is the melee disparity that needs addressing, not the casting time of caster spells, which would affect PvE to a greater extent than increasing AC and other stat bonuses on items for the various classes.<P>Our first consideration:  an Enchanter in an EQ group with improved AC, Hit Points, Resistances, and/or other various statistics as decided upon Vs. an Enchanter in an EQ group with greatly improved casting times.  On the one hand you have an Enchanter whose AC might cause him to be missed more often and take less damage, thus making him less "puny" as casters are too often portrayed in EQ PvP and other types of games; on the other hand you have an enchanter who can get his "mez" spells off much faster now--the most critical spell in saving his life and thus the lives of his party members.  In the same way apply this to clerics getting complete heals off in timely order (in PvP this would be very devastating, as this power is so great), or wizards getting evacuations and Gates off in record times.  It seems apparent which path offers the least resistance and provides a necessary change to EQ PvP.<P>After years of the same methods of fighting in Everquest, which have not attracted a large following of the PvP community, why should there be a present fear to change the system?  Or have we forgotten the stories in our literature that glorify the wizard standing alone against even the likes of dragons and demons, or the cleric who by his faith can stand at the forefront against even a Lich.  Rather, it would be appropriate and not overly change game balance, as I'm sure wizards will never "tank" dragons, and clerics will never stand at the forefront against a lich and remain unscathed.  Ultimately, casters still have significantly less health than melee-types, and this is what ultimately determines their inability to fight effectively in the foreground, coupled with the fact that they simply do not use martial skills to fight, generally speaking.  Additionally, I didn't suggest here that their Armor class needed to be put on the same par as a melee-types AC, but significantly increased nonetheless across the entire board.  And having dealt with the defensive problem surrounding Everquest PvP, I now turn to the subject of offensive melee combat in EQ.

         Solutions for the Future of PvP in EQ<BR>by Richard Gagliano<BR>Part 3, Melee Combat in Everquest: Offensive Overview<P>In Everquest offense has become so vital to its integrity that changing it is dangerous.  Remember, a combat system is at the heart of any game, and the more we fiddle with it, the more we are not working with the existing game, but creating a new game.  For this reason we want to offer solutions that require minimal reprogramming, thereby increasing their chances of being implemented.  The existing system should be left intact therefore; (Although there are PvP imbalances in the melee Disciplines which will be reviewed later on).  I argue this premise on the basis that the disparity between melee-types and casters has unanimously pointed towards the fact that casters were found wanting; and for this reason, coupled with the fact that melee classes do receive ranged attacks (many high-end bows in Everquest are very viable weapons), this is probably not an issue that needs addressing.  In short, if the melee-classes were having difficulty landing attacks due to this issue, the disparity in Armor Class would never have arisen; but it has been indeed shown that due to the PvE-geared evolution of EQ the melees have come to land hits too hard and too often in PvP perhaps.  It should also be noted that ranged fighting is also unanimously advantageous for casters, and therefore the issue of poor melee range works as a buffer against the fact that range is very limited in EQ for practical reasons; i.e. you can't see as far in the distance on a screen as you can in the real world, as an example.  Yet, there is one particular offensive subject which Everquest has neglected, and which should be addressed for the sake of PvP naturally--the ability to "touch your opponent" as a viable form of attack.<P>The implications of using "touch" in combat were well understood in past gaming systems, but in Everquest is totally neglected, perhaps because in the past there were programming obstacles, or because it would make the players jobs more difficult.  But in PvP the entire idea is to make the game require some measure of skill and well-thought strategy to defeat your opponent.  I often think of PvP matches the way I consider chess.  My character has many built traits, abilities, disciplines, skills, etc. which are part of my arsenal--the total sum being my character; or all the pieces of my chess-army, if I were to allude to a chess game.  Chess required thought, and each move was one in a series of possible moves, each leading to different conclusions.  In online PvP, the way this pans out, is that players use their skill, knowledge, and ingenuity to defeat their opponent using everything at their disposal:  faction, monster manipulation, spells, disciplines, movement, terrain, items, etc.  What begins to become obvious is that this new genre of gamers--the online PvP community--want to "own" each other, and prove their ability to each other, the same way chess players do.  And they want a viable platform to do this on--one that is entertaining and at least semi-balanced.   Now pressing onward, I want to discuss the different ways touch can and should be applied to Everquest.  It should be noted though that unlike the tank vs. caster disparity in melee, this subject is not vital to balancing Everquest for PvPrs; but it is very much worth mentioning as I will now entail.<P>First off, let's look at touch as it applies to offense.  In the traditional AD&D system touch required a successful attack roll.  Many spells come to mind that required a successful touch, such as Vampiric Touch, Chill Touch, Harm, and Destruction to name a few.  The only offensive power in Everquest that comes to mind that requires a "touch" at the moment is Harm Touch.  This ability has long been credited with being imbalanced and requiring little-to-no skill to use in PvP, but it is so integral to EQ that removing it at this stage is not very practical.  (Later on I will discuss how this ability is a PvP bug and should be curbed, along with all other near-instant abilities that do enough damage to slay opponents, even at full health, outrightly).  Harm Touch does not actually require a touch attack roll at the moment though.  Such an attack roll would balance this ability to a great extent, because it would require that a successful attack roll be made against a victim.  Failed attack rolls would result in a wasted use of the power obviously.  Such attack rolls are of course not subject to the normal ATK ratings in Everquest for realistic reasons.  It is much easier to physically touch someone than to physically damage someone.  Touching doesn't require you to pierce their armor, mearly to touch it.  For this reason touching would require an attack roll only against a players base armor class, or a new attack table created.  It makes sense that Harm Touch should require an attack roll too, because who "wants" to be touched by it?<P>Harm Touch is not the only offensive ability that could require touch either.  New Clerical spells could be implemented in the spirit of the old clerical spells which had power to harm living creatures, even outrightly destroying them, via a touch.  Again, I am referring to the AD&D model, where for every heal-type spell clerics received, they had counter-spells which likewise harmed living creatures in a relatively similar way.  This would give clerics the offensive power they entirely lack for balanced PvP in Everquest.  On the flip side, giving clerics these new powers would entail that their class be changed slightly.  For clerics also traditionally healed through touch as well.  But the difference in a defensive touch is self-evident.  In both cases, a new Touch hotkey could be implemented that would work when a player closed into melee range with a character (whenever he would normally begin to swing his weapon); the delay on this ability would of course be basically instant.<P>Implementing a necessary touch in order for "healing" magics that are not "areas of effect" to succeed would change PvP in Everquest, and not negatively, for several reasons.  First, because we have balanced the Cleric class by giving them new spells under this model, which are in the spirit and tradition of that class, to directly harm living creatuers in PvP via touch, and therefore, their healing ability needs to be balanced as well.  In the traditional AD&D game a complete heal was epic, and took an entire round of concentration to cast.  Adding the touch component to all heals in Everquest would make PvP more offensive in nature, less repetitive, and require more thought and talent in battle.  In implementing such a new feature, it should be understood that defensive touches, such as using a touch spell to infer an ability or healing to your ally, would not require an attack roll, only that the cleric be in proper range.  In the best PvP game I ever played, Neverwinter Nights of AOL, we had an honor system where healing didn't take place during a fight.  In Everquest though, healing magics are so rampant that they exceed the power of offensive magics by far.  This is not healthy for balanced PvP, because the idea is similar to chess--you don't want battles to stagnate, you want them to reach a conclusion.  A good example is an epicly -equipped Warrior fighting a Wizard in EQ.  The Wizard cannot even do the Warriors full life bar with all his mana (unless he is extremely lucky in landing through the warriors epic resistances).  Then a cleric can come up with one spell and heal the Warrior for all this damage.  Putting further checks and balances on healing in Everquest is very viable.  Adding this touch component to healing in Everquest would ensure a better balance of healing powers in battle, coupled with the addition of new offensive powers to the healing classes (especially clerics), but would not unbalance PvE on new/existing PvP servers, since clerics are already next to those whom they are healing in battle on the PvE scene.<P>When dealing with what the actual range a player must close into to use a successful touch, one is reminded of the current /attack command.  Basically, as soon as the player would close in to where using the /attack command he would successfully swing his weapon, this would initiate the touch ability.  Dependent on the spell "attached" to the touch, an attack roll would or would not be made, and the spell would then go off as intended.  New/existing spells obviously would have to be designed/re-designed and implemented, but in re-working the PvP servers of Everquest to truly obtain the majority of the PvP market that is surely out there, everything won't be a cheap and easy fix.  Considering the amount of profit V.I. stands to make if they invested into a small development team for such a project, I think they would be almost certain to succeed.  The reality is that Everquest is the largest most detailed virtual world ever built, beautiful and lush, and with some minor twinking it could evolve into an epic PvP game.  This is probably the most drastic and most debatable recommendation for Everquest I would make, but it is also one of the most viable in my opinion, and I will let it rest at that.  And concluding that subject, it is now time to move on to the remainder to other subjects that plague Everquest.

         Solutions for the Future of PvP in EQ<BR>by Richard Gagliano<BR>Part 4, PvP-Character Downtimes and Movement<P>Everquest has been up to this point an evolving game, and in that spirit this report is being fashioned; in the hopeful spirit that Everquest could evolve into a PvP game that attracts the majority of the PvP community/market.  And that is why it is now time to address many bugs that have been compiled regarding Everquest, and possible solutions to the problem they represent in the realm of PvP.  For when true concern is taken for the many voices that have argued for the change of these bugs over time, many of them will undoubtably, at the very least, be verbally addressed by V.I. for the PvP community.<P>For Everquest has evolved since the pre-Kunark days into a game the first players of Rallos Zek might hardly recognize.  With the addition of three expansions, and constant evolution of the game through additional patches, Everquest is the giant of gaming.  But all of this development effort to evolve EQ has failed to focus on its evolution as a PvP-centered game.  Because when you desire to make EQ a game designated for the PvP community, you can no longer think of EQ as a blue server, or try to appeal to our community the same way you appeal to the majority of your current servers.  Earlier analysis showed that EQ failed to capture even a moderate portion of the PvP market, let alone a majority of it.  This is because current EQ tactics revolve around making players spend a great deal of time to obtain their levels and items, thus taking great pride in them.  But this fails to capture the spirit of PvP, and what PvPrs desire.<P>To underline what I mean by this, first and foremost, new PvP-dedicated servers should include faster character downtimes.  These should be increases to the base mana and hp gains on this server.  Nothing major to unbalance the PvE in the game, but perhaps figures like:  +1 to HP and mana regains for every 5/10 levels gained, and/or boost the gains found in spells/items on this server.<P>Anything to boost overall mana and HP gain in Everquest will ultimately resort to faster "downtimes" inbetween adventuring, which is ultimately what most PvPrs want.  I've often heard blunt but very honest and practical statements like:  "OK we know we are hurt and we need lots of rest and meditation--we confess--but this is a fantasy so can we please just speed this part of the fantasy up now a little?"  Everquest should consider that most other PvP games on the market are fairly perpetual in comparison, having less downtimes, especially games that have held large portions of the PvP market in the past such as Ultima Online.<P>Our second consideration deals with movement in PvP.  The way movement works in Everquest, for the sake of PvP-dedicated servers, needs to be altered.  As a great example, consider a game of chess.  On both sides the players compete for domination of the boards positions.  Movement in PvP is much the same way.  In chess though, the two players have equal options of movement.  In Everquest, movement needs to be altered so that all classes have the potential to move at the same speed by the end-game of PvP.  This is critical.<P>Many might argue though that Bards, the fastest class in EQ, are the "masters of overland travel."  This is neither historically how the Bard class was fashioned in older games, nor is it how a balanced PvP game should be.  If anything, it is OK bards gain movement faster than others early on perhaps, but in the end game everyone needs to have the ability to travel at equal speeds somehow.  Thus the first decision is what the maximum speed is everyone can attain to in and out of doors.  Perhaps the current Bard speed isn't too fast for every day end-game PvP movements, but perhaps it is.  The current Bard speed is very twitch-dependent.  Perhaps toning it down a little is in order.  In theory and in practice this would go a long way in balancing a game involving strategic movements.  This means that all item/spell effects (including possible new ones, which are an easy way to introduce balance into Everquest), horses, alternate advancement movement abilities, bard songs, etc. would have to be balanced along these guidelines if movement became a serious consideration to the developers of EQ PvP servers.<P>In closing for this subject horses should be considered especially.  I see no problem with the players being able to summon "mystical" horses.  Dritzz (I think his name is spelled) is a popular literary fantasy character.  He wields two scimitars and has a statue of a black panther he can summon to him when he needs.  If this panther dies in combat it returns to statue form, and he can use it again after a while.  I view horses in EQ the same way, except you (V.I.) don't make Horses killable.  I think all the horses on a designated PvP server should, along with complying with movement regulations, be attackable and killable.  Their relative toughness as a "mob" in EQ should be dependent upon their cost.  Obviously the most expensive ones are epic-type pets, but should not be unkillable.<P>There are other arguments based more in the realm of superstition for making these changes, though chess is the most compelling argument.  In the AD&D system you must remember that wizards and priests had awesome powers of mobile movement.  Sure warriors had horses, but these spellcasters had spells like Fly, Wind Walk, Haste, and Slow.  Everquest has the Haste spell in the game to some extent, and the slow spell, although the class restrictions upon them are arguable.  I have often said movement is a critical factor in PvP, and so it is!  Part of the earlier discussion in this report involving melee vs. caster melee combat entails that if a melee can stay on top of a caster, he usually has an advantage.  Thus, greater movement rates to certain classes unbalances this in some ways.  We've seen the complaints by casters that they have to run so much from their opponents.  It then follows that they should be able to run effectively if they have to run so much.  Everyone who "knows" on the Zek servers fears being caught in the open where a Bard and some Rogues play "chop-seuy" with them.  V.I. could take the position that this is fair because EQ is a game of special group balances, but as stated earlier, we are trying to balance PvP to appeal to the mass community--making V.I. money and players happy.  We are not trying to create elite sects of certain player combinations that prevail time and again because of faulty game mechanics.<P>And yes it is true that some characters can Gate to escape situations where they are outmaneuvered, but this is not in the spirit of PvP.  Rather it is better to put PvPrs on equal footing, and give them the chance to "own" each other on such terms.

         Solutions for the Future of PvP in EQ<BR>by Richard Gagliano<BR>Part 5, PvP-Character Development<P>Everyone in the PvP community can remember the tension they felt getting ready to "own each other" on Shadowbane back when its imminent release was always on the horizon.  Everyone spoke eagerly of promises of a game geared towards PvP, with faster character development, and more balanced player combat.  This is my call to Everquest:  take up arms and do what Shadowbane fails to do by delivering on the competitions own statements.  The Shadowbane currently being made deals with mass strategic and political scopes, but I think Everquest has more potential in single player, group, and even guild PvP.  The dynamic of Everquest keeps players competing in Everquest for key strategic locations to hunt in the game, and thus the game is perpetuated.  The only thing missing is to finally balance the game for PvP purposes, so players desire to fight each other for the sheer thrill and skill involved in it is perpetuated.<P>All along in this report I've called for dedicated PvP servers in EQ, possibly at a premium rate, dedicated to catching the attention of the PvP community, which offer a more PvP balanced version of EQ (without changing the game itself).  Notice how I also mentioned faster character development.  Even though V.I. views the length of time in EQ to develop characters necessary, there is much to be said about the matter.<P>In Everquest, especially with the advent of Luclin, building a character to the end game takes a rediculous amount of time.  And the reason this is a problem in the PvP community is simple.  We don't play online games to build characters, raid, quest, faction, etc.  We play to challenge ourselves against other players.  This is where the end-game becomes the best part of a game for us.  This is why we stress balance so often in the end-game.  If you make a good end-game, the roleplay will build itself through increasing numbers of players desiring to interact with each other more consistently due to PvP balances and checks.<P>It is my humble and sincere opinion, that above most other changes in Everquest, one of the largest changes needs to be in the Experience system (the very system you are most adamant about not changing), especially when one considers the evolution of the character creation system over time.  Although giving Sullon Zek a 20% experience bonus was a good start, it hardly even affected the overall rate at which characters were built in-game--a problem from the majority of the PvP communities point of view.  Time is money my friends.  We have real-lives to live, and that's why it's crucial to get "inside" the head of gamers who are interested in PvP, or else you'll never  be designing a game that attracts them.  Because when you get inside their heads, you'll realize I'm right on this issue.<P>At first, characters were designed to level to 50, and then quest and function as guilds at war and working towards various political ends and intrigues that arose between players during this time.  But instead of focus on PvP, Everquest continually adds PvE content to the end game, thus post-poning the end game, although not necessarily promoting true roleplay--something that only the spirit of the players can probably bring alive, coupled with the right game.  With Kunark, leveling became a chore almost, as many people complained how long it took to reach 60.  And now with Luclin, Alternate Advancement points are another means to post-pone the end game and build upon this games appeal, instead of working to create better end game PvP:  the entire point of this report.<P>I think the game worked best when there was less land and characters took less time to build.  For all the games splendor and complexity now, it was easier to appeal to the PvP community when players were easier to find on the map, and it was easier to gain the necessary power to vanquish your foes in Everquest.  This trend can be observed in the fact that populations on PvP servers have suffered over time, instead of increasing as they ought if the actual PvP systems were being improved.<P>Ultimately, the answer is to reduce the amount of experience needed in this game by as much as 50%.  Sullon Zek taunts you with fast gains promising a 20% bonus I believe, but realistically if you want to cater this game to the next generation of kids, young men, and adults in the PvP community, they don't have the patience of people in Everquest "blue" servers, and that's why they are not playing those "blubie/carebear servers."  Without trying to offend it has to be stated that this game is truly repetitive.  How many times should a player really solo the same creature (using a soloing necromancer as an example) before he learns enough from that encounter? Or a group that pulls to the same spot of a dungeon until they know how many bricks are on the walls at their pull spots (sarcasm excluded).  There is grief on PvP servers, and most of it is due to leveling.<P>It's a simple concept.  PvPrs want to win.  In America we teach our kids to play to win.  And well...competition is the way of the world.  A lot of PvPrs quit EQ before the end-game though because they don't have the time or patience to play your game.  They quit because they don't want to be mediocre characters; as I'm pointing out, people want to be the best.  In a very practical way though, if you want to truly reduce grief in EQ from PvP servers, it won't be possible through removing corpse camping, bind camping, etc., but it will be possible by reducing the amount of experience needed to advance in this game.  I don't need to press on about this matter any further.  It is very self-evident  both as a problem and as something that could be easily solved.<P>

         Solutions for the Future of PvP in EQ<BR>by Richard Gagliano<BR>Part 6, PvP-Character Ability Bugs 1-5<P>Here on out lie many odds and ends of Everquest PvP, many long neglected.  These are compiled off the boards of various PvP guilds in the game of Everquest, and are a general list of the problems players face daily in the PvP scene I have gathered from my years of playing Rallos and Sullon Zek.  All of these items need to be addressed, at least verbally at the very least.  I cannot argue as vigorously for each of their causes, due to the length of this report which only attempts to assess overall problems and provide solutions, without becoming too attached to any specific one.  Each of these to a certain degree has plagued the PvP community of Everquest.  In assessing these, I believe the goal is not only to appease the current EQ PvP community, but attract others who up until now have been dubious of it--a great many people.<P>1) Dispel Items/Instant Click Items<BR>Instant casting dispel items have been rechargeable for some time now.  Thus players use these items to strip all their enemies before combat.  This is doubly an advantage to the melee classes.  Removing this bug is necessary for game balance.  These items make the abjuration series of spells and buffs less viable.  Fixing this bug is simple.  Casting times need to be added to all these items.  These casting times should reflect the casting times of the spells they mirror, naturally.  This should be applied in the case of any instant casting item, until such a time as V.I. fixes the recharge bug.  Having the ability to cast something infinitely through the use of this bug is an unintentional advantage given to players with these items, in this case.<P>2) "Poofing" Pets<BR>For some time bards have had the ability to automatically remove pets from combat via "poofing."  Quite simply, this ability needs to be removed.  The best example is the Magician, who without his pet, is a watered down Wizard.  For the sake of balance, Magicians should not be put at such a great disadvantage because of this bug.  The Magician population on many Zeks suffers, especially Sullon Zek as far as I'm concerned.  Their lack of damage aborbing shields and the ability for their pets to be instantly destroyed in PvP makes them very undesirable to play.  Making their pets "unpoofable" would make them viable in PvP and easily fix this bug.  Therefore, the Bard songs that allow this to happen need to be nerfed, or the data of summoned pets needs to be altered to prevent this from happening.<P>3) Cleric Epics<BR>The Cleric Epic is the most powerful epic in the game.  No other class has nearly a comparable item.  The biggest problem with this item is that in Guild warfare, it unbalances PvP.  Guilds with Cleric Epics in end-game PvP can use this item to ressurect players who fall in combat without so much as casting delays.  The Cleric Epics should have considerable re-cast delays applied to them to balance Everquest on this matter once and for all.  Players that die in combat should suffer certain downtime consequences.  Otherwise large scale battles endure, instead of having conclusions.  I.e. the "uber" guild goes and just rezzes their fallen comrades, while the non-#####guild loses the hunting ground because of this one overly powered item that they don't possess.<P>4) Gating<BR>This issue is noted simply to clarify the use of Gate.  In the AD&D system Teleport had a casting time of 5.  Ironically, in Everquest, Gate likewise has a casting time of 5.  This has been a long enduring number, tested and true.  Potions in the game now make it possible for every class to Gate in some fashion effectively.  For this reason this ability should not be altered.  The Everquest Gate system stays true to mainline fantasy, making it possible only for a very rare few to be able to travel great distances in such short periods of time--almost instantly!  This fantastic power is well-handled in Everquest and deserves such note.  There is an issue out there concerning melees being unable to Channel Gate-type potions.  It needs to be clarified though that melee-classes have no formal spell training.  Likewise, casters have no formal weapons and armor training, and for the same reason they never learn to gain extra attacks, hit points, or bonuses to base AC, dual wield, double attack, block/parry, etc.<P>5) Tracking<BR>Tracking is crucial to PvP, because if you cannot find your enemy, you cannot engage him or repay the favor, so to speak.  The makers of Shadowbane wanted to make a system where you could always find your enemy.  While I definitely don't agree with this, I think that tracking needs to be broadened for the sake of balance and various arguments.  The fact that only Bards, Druids and Rangers receive tracking is not entirely accurate from a historical point of view either.  Wizards had the power to scry enemies from afar, and even Clerics were given the power (I believe) by their deity on occassion to view the doings of their enemies.  Spells like Eye of Zomm entirely fail to capture this spirit of the feared caster, with eyes "in the back of their heads."  Items like Crystal Balls from the AD&D system, which allowed players to gage the location of their enemies, also come to mind.  This lack of divination in Everquest is apparent.  Similarly to how the "sight" series of spells fail to do virtually anything useful.  Furthermore, with the random availability of tracking hacks like ShowEQ, tracking can be seen as being "bugged" in PvP.<P>In Everquest casters are currently people that spend a lot of time running in combat creating brief respites in which to cast--not the wizards I think of when I think of Gandalf, Pug, Raistlin, Elminster, so on and so on.  Their sight-line of spells fail to divine things sooner for them than intended.    Their inability to track enemies make them even less fearsome and "all-knowing" as they are portrayed in older games and in literature.  This problem could be rectified by giving various of these spellcasting classes abilities that mock tracking (in other words, simulate it in some fashion), and who is to say warriors and the like cannot pick up tracking as a secondary skill in the course of their life?  Personally, I would make tracking an ability everyone can learn, although perhaps make it more difficult to build for some classes than others.  Or I would invent new items to give players various tracking powers (thus mimmicking abilities like those gained from Crystal Balls, Divining Rods, etc.).<P><BR>

         Solutions for the Future of PvP in EQ<BR>by Richard Gagliano<BR>Part 7, PvP-Character Ability Bugs 6-10<P>6) Mana Burn<BR>The release of Mana Burn has caused some players to leave PvP servers in disgust.  I can honestly say this because I am one such player.  As long as this ability exist in Everquest, I personally will not play the game.  That is how severely unbalanced it is.  Luckily, I have no point to prove here.  Everyone agrees.  So the question is, what is the best solution?  Remove it or nerf it?  The problem is making it so that this ability does not kill Enchanters in one shot, no matter how much you nerf it.  This is almost impossible at the moment.  My only real suggestion is to remove it, or nerf it so severely that it only does 33% of its current damage.  This is just one of many viable suggestions.  I would also require this spell to be delivered by touch (if this optional combat system I presented were implemented), to ensure that it had an even greater chance of failing to land.  Manaburn needs to have a special graphical effect and E-mote to go with it as well, just like powerful Disciplines do.<P>7) Life Burn<BR>Life Burn likewise can be overpowered in circumstances due to the great number of HP buffs and items end-game Necromancers can possibly attain.  Overall though I think this spell is fun and slightly appropriate.  I would have it do the casters Hit Point Total in damage, but I would make the damage nerfed by 50%.  |Again, any ability that can instantly kill an Enchanter (the weakest class health wise), is overpowered.  Additionally, I would make it also have to be administered by touch (again, using my optional system).  Lifeburn, like Manaburn, needs to have a special graphical effect and E-mote to go with it as well, just like powerful Disciplines do.  In the case of both Life Burn and Manaburn, what should be strived for is the severe nerfing of their current power levels, without removing them from PvP because they spice the game up.<P>8) Harm Touch<BR>This ability was already discussed.  I just want to mention that if the addition of a touch requiring an attack roll was not added to this ability, then the damage on it should be slightly nerfed further.  It should be brought to do 50% its PvE damage.  As a rule, I would say if Harm Touch can instantly dropp an unbuffed Enchanter, then it is overpowered; and at the moment it certainly can.  Furthermore, with the advent of Harm Touch Lifetaps now due to A.A. points, the use of a "touch" for this ability remains even more viable.<P>9) Critical Hits in Melee and Spellcasting<BR>The problem with critical tables are that they make battles excessively random.  I suggest the actual result of critical hits (and even the improved crippling blows) be nerfed so that all critical damage in PvP is lessened.  Currently critical hits do double damage I believe. I believe in PvP critical hits should be doing about 50% less of the actual "critical damage" they are doing for the sake of balance (if not even less damage), and to elminate the problem of randomness which is so rampant in the current EQ PvP system.<P>10) Resistances<BR>Melee damage is unresistable; Damage Shields are unresistable; Lifetaps are fairly unresistable; Healing spells don't fail when successfully cast either; most DOTs are unresistable; and yet casters who cast offensive spells are devastated by the amount of resistance players can attain in the end-game on PvP servers due to the constant influx of new resist items over the years.  This issue actually deserves much more space than I will presently give it.<P>While better and better resist gear has constantly been introduced into the game, ways to overcome it have usually not been introduced.  Spellcasters are good at buffing, but most have limited Debuffs at best.  When the power of these Debuffs was increased on PvP servers it was a step in the right direction, but for the sake of the end-game, further balance needs to be considered.<P>And yet strangely, while classes that don't even have the ability to fashion the most rudiment of spells walk around with the best resistance gear in the game, the casting classes that supposedly make it suffer for it; it makes no sense that casters suffer for the very gear they are capable of crafting.  Earlier in the report it was discussed that items created many problems in Everquest PvP, and it is likewise true items can fix them.<P>The other problem a guild leader of Sullon Zek noted earlier in February of 2002.  A full HP warrior can become unkillable by a wizard (short of using the extremely bugged Manaburn).  This is because his resistances and HP due to items can become so absurdly high that only Lure-based spells have any true effect upon him consistently.  The danger here though is in making it possible for casters to kill melee-classes without being able to easily kill each other.  Ultimately, the resist system in EQ is imperfect, but one which players have to work around.  Changing the entire resist system would require changing too many features of the game.  Therefore here are my proposed solutions.  <P>It may not be possible for wizards to ever kill a full HP warrior in Everquest, but if it were to become possible, the two things I'm mentioning must take place:  casters resistances must first be increased in a new item pool (something already discussed) and the power of debuffing abilities would have to be increased again.  I would propose a new system where spellcasters spells have greater built in debufs for their respective resistance-types as they gain levels.  The exact checks and balances of such a system cannot be discussed here.  With the improved stats due to these items put into the game as checks and balances, casters could have the ability to affect their enemies more with spells in end-game PvP, without being overpowered against each other.  As I said, I would like to spend much more time on this perhaps in the future, but it would require a serious interest on the part of the EQ developers.<BR>

         Solutions for the Future of PvP in EQ<BR>by Richard Gagliano<BR>Part 8, PvP-Character Ability Bugs 11-15<P>11)  Training<BR>Feign Death is an odd ability reserved for a few players.  It's use in the EQ PvE system makes it impossible to remove.  Therefore, ways of limiting training need to be made.  In end-game training the most rediculous kind involves the use of Ressurection-spells and the Call of Hero spell to allow players with Feign Death (usually Monks) to train groups/guilds in dungeons and then click "Yes" and be "whisked" away from their own trains and the people they are training, thus removing their accountability in PvP.  For PvP purposes this is totally unbalancing obviously.  To fix it, I propose a casting time be attached to the Ressurection spells and the Call of Hero spell on the recipients side of the spell.  This spell effect would mimmick a Gate spell.  I.e. when the spell is cast upon the recipient and they click "Yes," the spell begins to cast itself on their person (with a gate-graphics effect that in a proposed 5 second period of time then whisk them away), with all chances for interruptions that normally apply to a spell applicable.  This would elminate the use of these spells from being used as they currently are:  in unforeseen ways that degrade the quality of group/guild PvP in EQ.<P>12)  Area of Effect Spells<BR>Considering the games almost complete absence of them from an offensive perspective, and then considering the great deal of defensive Area of Effect spells (realistically to be viewed as group-spells, it being all relative), it becomes obvious this was neglected either for programming reasons, system resource purposes, or just that--neglect.  A well used Area of Effect is costly, but can and should also be able to be used to turn the tide of battles.  Like the Wizard who mowed down a company of Orcs before they ever reached him, etc.  Damage is not the only use for Area of Effect though.  Old AD&D spells like Poisonous Cloud, Web, Chain Lightning, and Prismatic Wall are just a few of many various types of spells that are all but ignored in Everquest.  This would add diversity to Everquest PvP, to the great delite of the players I believe.  The sky is the limit in regards to this, and I really thought the matter needed addressing.<P>13) Inner Fire and Duelist<BR>Some players argue these are overpowered.  I'm simply including them for the sake of thoroughness.  Earlier I mentioned that movement needs to be changed in Everquest so everyone is on "equal footing" so to speak.  If this were implemented, then these abilities would not need changing, but as long as melees can "run down" caster-type classes, these abilities will remain overpowered.<P>14)  Water Bug<BR>Is this bug ultimately unfixable?  V.I. said at the Dallas Fan Faire, in regards to PvP discrepancies, that "we are always very quick to go and fix anything that just doesn't work in the PvP environment."  While the validity of this statement is debatable, I will say that the water bug has been something that has long bugged players.  Why do no spells work across the elements of air and water?  Realistically ice-based and lightning-based attacks, to name a few, would work between the elements of water and air to some extent.  Many argue that spells should work through water.  In the dynamic of the AD&D system, logic was used.  For example, fire based spells had no effect in water, however lightning spells did work, sometimes to the detriment of people in the area; likewise ice-based spells often worked under water, but gaseous spells did not, etc. V.I. fails to address this topic, verbally or in-game, to the best of my knowledge.<P>15)  Levitation Bug<BR>The power to levitate can render a spellcaster completely immune to melee classes.  Players that can levitate quite simply can dance around a melee-class all they want with this bug.  Potions and items need to be put more readily into the game to give melees the ability to levitate more easily to compensate for this.<P>Indeed there are many other bugs I'm sure I'm overlooking, but these are 15 of the biggest concerns currently out there.  This has been a quite lengthy report, so I will now move onward to concluding it for the sake of my audience as well as myself.<P><P><P><P><P><P>

         Solutions for the Future of PvP in EQ<BR>by Richard Gagliano<BR>Part 9, Conclusion: PvP Servers in EQ<P>Finally, I would say a word about the current Zek servers.  They are inadequate to meet the redifining that should take place to make this game a legendary PvP game.  Item looting has been proven already to be a bad idea in Everquest, considering how important items have become.  I think the current system where experience and money are lost is the best, and the fact most players play on this type of server shows it's probably a correct assumption.<P>Where I think the Zek servers fail though is in the same area games like DaoC fail.  They try to promote roleplaying through the use of teams, but these teams have no logical or role-played purposes for being there.  A true fantasy world is a limitless world, like Rallos Zek, where each player has free will to decide exactly what he will do, and it is in this spirit that I think the best PvP servers are made.  Teams create problems like cross-teaming as well, and don't promote the decision making process of a player to decide where he stands in a world, because you limit his decisions.<P>PvPrs don't just want to fight people within 4 levels of themselves like Rallos Zek either, because there are 60 possible levels, and that makes the game less interesting to this crowd of people.  Therefore, I propose that anybody within 20 levels of a player be attackable.  To me, this seems more reasonable than the current hardcore attitude of Sullon Zek--it would cause less grief.  Yet, it is not as conservative as say Tallon or Vallon, and would not cause players to spend as much time in boredom searching for enemies.<P>Despite the failure of Sullon Zek to attract a substantial population, that does not mean Everquest players do not want to play on PvP servers.  It simply means, more likely, that Sullon Zek's rule-set failed to a certain extent, because it didn't address PvP as a whole in Everquest, it just simply slapped some new rules onto a server.<P>In this report I have attempted to isolate most the of the imbalances in Everquest PvP and provide practical solutions that could be applied to new PvP servers dedicated to improving PvP in Everquest.  I am confident if measures were taken to work to this goal, even with the inclusion of the ideas expressed here, that such servers would be smashing successes.  Perhaps PvP servers require more attention, and therefore are a more "premium" type of service for this reason.  Nonetheless, through many examples and arguments herein I have shown that such a server could and above that should be created by V.I. using what is the greatest game ever made from a PvE point of view.<P>As always, I am aware of the Everquest politics that hold back such servers.  The nagging complaints and perhaps even a few staunch players who would quit in rebellion to this new dawn of Everquest, but ultimately, it would revive the game in a way you have yet to consider possible, and corner a market you have yet to tap into.  Until such a time as Everquest becomes a game truly dedicated to PvP....<P>Well met Everquest.<P>Completed: Saturday, February 10th, 2002<P><P><P>

         Everquest PvP can not be saved, not without the added expense of breaking the PvE system. An entirely new game would need to be created to fix EQ PvP.<P>The biggest problem is that Everquest was built from the ground up, balanced around ever increasing PvE challenges. The result, a massive imbalance in PvP at the end game. PvP needs to be built and balanced at the end game, PvE encounters then built at the end game based on the balance of the PvP system and then scaled back down through the levels. It is not critical for PvP to be balanced throughout on the way up, so long as it is balanced at the end. <P>That aside, I have a real problem with melees being more powerful than casters. Someone who can strap on armor and swing a sword being almost invincible to someone who can alter matter and weave incredible magics? It doesnt sit well with me. <P>Additionally, EQ does not have nearly enough spell gem slots, it would need at least double and potentially triple the number of gem slots. Defensive magics need to be implemented. For example, in a role-playing context, dont you think a wizard who can form a ball of destructive fire from mid air and hurl it at their opponent would take the time in their ardent life long studies of arcane magic to research the creation of spells that would protect them against swords that cut them down like a stick of butter or arrows that can be shot at them from any imbecile capable of stringing a bow? Even perhaps a spells that can protect them against melee attacks or ranged attacks but not both at the same time? Spells that last a short duration that can not up at the same time (focus required to hold the spell). Spells that would be reasonable strategies because of the addition of additional spell slots. <P>As much as strategy is good for PvP, so are tactics. Tactics are lacking in EQ because of the shallow pool of counter tactics and the limitations of the insufficient number of spell gems. <P>Theres a whole lot more wrong with EQ PvP than simply that. Any game can be built for decent PvP using a multitudes of systems (meaning you do not need to mirror the AD&D system as so much of your post seems to imply) so long as the entire game is built for PvP balance at the top. Not only is the entire initial build of EQ in conflict with that theory but they also added additional levels (and now AA points) to handle ever more increasingly difficult PvE encounters which compound the crux of the problem with EQ PvP. <P>In short, EQ PvP can not be saved. Lets hope that somebody, some day, builds a PvP game from the top down. Problem solved, move along.<P>Azmodion<BR>KAAOS

         your right azmodion.<P>kaaos knows their shit when it comes to gaming.  EQ wont ever be a viable PvP game.<P>I think the whole report was written to try to give Verrant ideas on ways to balance what little they can in PvP without recreating the game.  In other words:  the reason they change nothing in PvP is to not upset PvE.  I tried to offer suggestions that would retain the balance of their precious game (which I don't particularly even like), while making PvP a  little more fun and balanced at the same time.<P>But basically your saying EQ PvP cannot be saved, and I won't even argue with that.<P>Not one V.I. employee ever responded to me regarding even 1 issue in my report.<P>Nuff said.

         Oh please.<P>You spend god knows how long writing nine pages of boring, repetative drivel about making EQ a decent PvP game and then after reading one comment from someone else you do a complete u-turn and state that EQ will never be viable PvP game.<P>Have some conviction for fucks sake, and don't try and tell me "oh I wasn't really bothered anyway" because you and I both know you'd be talking out of your anus.<P>Quote:- <i>"I tried to offer suggestions that would retain the balance of their precious game (which I don't particularly even like)..."</i><P>Really?  Ok, well how's about this statement from your "report" written merely a few days before...<P>Quote:- <i>What is simple to identify is that you have made the greatest massive multi-player online role-playing PvE game in history. Note--you made the greatest PvE game in history; but have you truly made the best PvP game in history? The answer is sadly no; and I say sadly because this game has the potential to be the greatest online PvP game as well. </i><P>I completely disagree with most everything in your long winded essay, and I hate the way you wrote it, but neither of those particularly irritated me.  What irritated me is the fact that you have not got the balls to defend your own reasoning.  Say something and stand by it, or don't bother bleating in the first place.<P>Oh, and if you say "for" in that annoying context one more time I am going to carve the word out of your flesh and cram it up your arse.<P><i>If you're too open minded your brains will fall out.</i>
