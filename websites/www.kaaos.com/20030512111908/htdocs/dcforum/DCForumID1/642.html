A counter-tactic would be "an opposing technique or means for accomplishing an end." <P>Now, if you wanted strategy or counter strategy, use definition 2b of device and you would have "a plan or scheme for accomplishing an end." Which gives it a bigger scope than a tactic because strategy is a full plan, not just a technique. <P>That's your lesson for today. Too bad you're too stupid to let any of it set in. You really need to work on your knowledge of the english language.<P>Mortarion<BR>god of death and decay

         <BR>What is a counter attack? <P>I know what a counter tactic is at least. It is a number of ways to escape harm and win a fight and not just to survive an attack. Not just one technique like you tried to say. There is rarely just one technique when it comes to a game or real life fight.<P>Big fucking deal huh? You just wanted to start some stupid shit didn’t you? DIDN’T YOU!<P> That is why they added the scheme part in it as well with that definition dumbass.<BR> It is a plan so it can involve more than one action. <BR>And a plan is an orderly arrangement of parts of an overall design or objective.<BR> And parts such as a trapped pouch can be use like I said with the game Ultima for a counter tactic.

The last portion of shows the true meaning of counter- attacking.<a href="http://www.lwcbooks.com/articles/edgedweapons.html" target="_blank">http://www.lwcbooks.com/articles/edgedweapons.html</a><P>There is nothing with my other posts with my choice of words. I never said you had to use more than one choice of counter tactic since you can only use one at a time :) I listed the ones that could be used to counter a move.<P>What is a counter attack?<P>I know what a counter tactic is at least. It is a number of ways to escape harm and win a fight and not just to survive an attack. Not just one technique like you tried to say. There is rarely just one technique when it comes to a game or real life fight. <P>Big fucking deal huh? You just wanted to start some stupid shit didn’t you? DIDN’T YOU!<P>That is why they added the scheme part in it as well with that definition dumbass.<BR>It is a plan so it can involve more than one action.<BR>And a plan is an orderly arrangement of parts of an overall design or objective.<BR>And parts such as a trapped pouch can be use like I said with the game Ultima for a counter tactic.<P>Main Entry: counter-<BR>Function: prefix<BR>Etymology: Middle English contre-, from Middle French, from contre<BR>1 a : contrary : opposite &lt;counterclockwise&gt; &lt;countermarch&gt; b : opposing : retaliatory &lt;counterforce&gt; &lt;counteroffensive&gt;<P>Main Entry: 1at•tack<BR>Pronunciation: &-'tak<BR>Function: verb<BR>Etymology: Middle French attaquer, from (assumed) Old Italian estaccare to attach, from stacca stake, of Germanic origin; akin to Old English staca<BR>Date: 1600<BR>transitive senses<BR>1 : to set upon or work against forcefully<BR>2 : to assail with unfriendly or bitter words<BR>3 : to begin to affect or to act on injuriously<BR>4 : to set to work on<BR>5 : to threaten (a piece in chess) with immediate capture<BR>intransitive senses : to make an attack<P>Main Entry: 1tac•tic<BR>Pronunciation: 'tak-tik<BR>Function: noun<BR>Etymology: New Latin tactica, from Greek taktikE, from feminine of taktikos<BR>Date: 1640<BR>1 : a device for accomplishing an end<BR>2 : a method of employing forces in combat<P>So we can see a counter tactic is using a device or item for the dumbass that though otherwise.<P>geo<BR>god of storms

         First, you are an idiot.  You are taking quotes from an essay about how to fight edged weapon attackers out of context.  None of the strategy talked about in the article are pertinent to this discussion because you aren’t a “victim” and none of us are attacking you with knife, though if you give us an address I’m sure we’d accommodate you.  Funny part about that is you are putting yourself in the victim role.  I guess you’re used to playing that part.<P>BTW, that guy in the essay is using the phrase “counter tactic” liberally because anything a victim does to an armed attacker would be considered a counter tactic.  <P>Dethan D’Istir<BR>

         In a thread you started, there was one reply followed by 5 more of your own and then 2 simply stating the obivous....that you are an idiot. My question is why can't you achieve your idiocy in less posts? It is clear that you have the capabilitiy, skill and fortitude of some of the world's best losers. I think it is time you buckle down and shoot for idiocy through condensation. We do not need to read 6 posts of yours in one thread to confirm your idiocy. It simply wastes our time, web space and ultimately precious time that you could be using to prove to others that you are indeed a grade A, top notch, numero uno, king of the hill, editor's pick idiot persona non grata. Take comfort in the fact that there are many people on the net who have probably not seen proof of your idiocy and get to work.<P>SangDraxx<BR>KAAOS<BR>The Serpent Lord<P><BR>

         I dunno why I still read this board. <P>Geo. Listen. Carefully. Please. <P>"I thought there were enough for an old designed game like Ultima Online. You had pouches, potions, healing, magic cloths, magic weapons, and thats not counting hiding, music, magic deflect, armor, recall and that mage armor spell that seemed to be a good idea. Its just too bad the mages had the best spells."<P>It's obvious you sucked at UO PVP. Pouches WERE a para buster, and that is about the only counter tactic you listed. But it was a counter tactic against a lame ass move in the first place. The old expo/para trick was about as lame as they came in UO. So, anyone who was going to jump some fuckin twat in the woods carried trapped pouches to get out of that, and that tactic has been gone for some time now. The rest of the shit you spewed has nothing to do with battle tactics. <P>Battle tactics, as the K'wuss folk are trying to explain to you, are things which you as a person mentally decide to do to beat your opponent. Carrying a magic weapon is not a mental decision to out manuver your opponent, nor is quaffing pots every ten seconds. <P>Certainly magic cloth or recalling is not even in the realm of battle tactics to those who understand how to win fights. This is the problem with people like yourself Geo, and there are many of you, is that you rely on items, potions, and running as your main "tactic". And this is also why you and a group of people like you would never, ever, under no realm of the imagination, be able to stand toe to toe with a group like K'wuss, BC, ToM, or any other group of skilled (mentally) players. And, it wouldn't matter if you outnumbered them 10-1, you will lose, badly. <P>The K'wuss folks here are trying to explain to you that to excel at PVP in a game, any game, you have to understand the combat system and why and how things work. And in order to understand how and why people do what they do in PVP you have to PVP in it's purest form. Even. No magic shit, no potions, no running, to the death. When you get to the that level, that you can walk into an arena and hold your own, then you can start to talk shit. Until then... shut up and listen, you may learn something from these pukes. <P>And, the "it's just to bad the mages had the best spells" comment... ummm, what, you think that warriors should have the best spells?<P>Idjit. <P>Abs<P>

         I will explain it one more time then I am going to get a suntan.<P>Most good players if they get attacked by evil players try to run away. This will not help in any battles and will mostly lead to death. Instead, a counter-tactic would have to be used, then a counter-attack like I said above. Counter-tactics are mostly used for defending, counter-attacks are for attacking the attacker since a good defence is a good offence.<P> I did not say what you said Abs, "Ya gotta use counter tactics if you want to fight with counter tactics?" I said what I said with "In a pvp fight you had to use counter-tactics (mostly with mages or poisoners) at first if you wanted to fight back with counter-ATTACKS"<P>I knew I would get some lame jerk who wants so bad to make me look bad. But it is too late for yall to repair the damage since yall suck at making friends to someone outside of the KAAOS pack.<P>geo<BR>god of storms

Would of been fun if you described what it is that I just don't get with a certain post that I made. Because I "get" all of my post with great understanding.<P>I am more of a positive person than all of KAAOS combined. I was able to start answering Karst’s question in the Gods Never Die forum or at least get the ball rolling. Those juices in the brain have to be started by me most times.<P>The answer that SangDraxx gave was very morbid and not too informative as mine. Mine was in fact  more positive explaining what Karst can do to achieve god like status NOW and not just describing the history part. It is what you can do now to achieve it and not just your history as I pointed out here:<P>“So Ego might have a bold title "Your God" with a capital G being the Allmighty, but he would be an average player in a new environment or game until he met up with his KAAOS friends or played enough hours to be semi-good. It would take many hours of playing to feel godlike in any game.”<P>-Karst has to find a guild or clan with the same goal.<P>-Karst has to play enough hours so that every action in the game is second nature.<P>-Karst would be able to practice his character with the best players that he could find. (Does not have to be KAAOS since they are the best with turn based games only)<P>You are missing the whole point of my posts Mortarion. If it is not making fun of KAAOS for being evil, my posts are for helping new people who ask questions to KAAOS and barely get enough positive answers.

         Geo, I don’t expect the person responding to me to be “positive”.  In fact, I’d rather have the guy responding to me be hostile as long as he is capable of making a point.  You are not capable of doing that so please stop responding to people.  Even YOU don’t understand your own posts.  That is why you post 3-5 replies to your own messages most of the time.  <P>And your post to Karst wasn’t that helpful.  In fact, it was demeaning.  Everyone knows they have to practice and play a game a lot to get good at it.  You have to tell them something they don’t already know to be truly helpful.  <P>And since I’m being helpful I’ll answer Karst’s original questions without going into a detailed history of the world.<P>Question 1<BR>Karst:<BR>“You can't build your image simply around talk...or can you? I'm currently immersed in an online community that likes to never leave your past in the past. Is it different in the realms that you play in?”<P>Actually, you can create an image with talk.  People are easily fooled by blowhard wannabe’s.  Rarely do the masses know who the best PVP players are.  And how could they?  Even in NWN the PVP ladder and WPC rankings were not common knowledge.  The normal player only knows those within their little group of 10-40 players that they personally associate with.  And it is easy for some guy that knows a few PVP tricks to come in and fool an entire group of players into thinking he’s Gods gift to PVP.  And that guy losing to someone outside the group rarely dispels the godliness of this type of con man.  In fact, all he’ll have to say is “he cheated” and the flock will believe him entirely.  <P>For some reason people believe those that scream the loudest.  It is sad but true.  Online communities are fickle little whiny bitches that way.  Rarely does the online community have a clue what is really taking place within a game.  They have their own Inquirer version of what’s happening.  Sure, it is fun to read, but common, Azmo is not having my fucking baby.<P>Question 2<BR>Geo:<BR>“What if you can not rip the face off if they are in town?”<P>First, um, let me get my Captain Crunch idiot decoder ring out.  Let me see. Yes, I do believe you are trying to say, “What if you continually get trounced by someone?  Doesn’t that make you less of a god?”  The answer is NO.  There are going to be instances where there are people you continually lose to either by skill or luck.  Those people are called your competition.  Those are the people you have to continually seek out and fight to become the best.  Only when you do that will you get respect from the top players.  If you lie or run away from fighting those that beat you then you are the gimp from question 1.  Sure, you’ll still have your idiot followers, but everyone else picking up the real newspaper will know you for a coward.<P>Dethan D’Istir<BR>Yeah, I’m sick and I’m bored.<BR>  <BR>

         <BR>Dethan, you have failed to provide any examples to me showing that I am not helpful with my responses. Just saying that I post 3-5 replies to a topic is not substantial proof. I don't expect to be positive with everyone, especially a punk like you. So what if I have an additional comment to make at a later time, did you make that rule with the number of comments allowed?<P>I am able to make a “point” and get to the root of the question long before KAAOS will even attempt to answer. Sometimes I refrain from posting my solutions I get. This is because there may be many solutions that can be carried out. It is up to the reader to come up with their best resolve and not just my solution that I think is best. My solution could be the opposite of your solution since there can be quite a lot of good choices to use while gaming. <P>People create an image by an image (something they saw). The proof of the image is in the death and destruction the player makes while in action. Games are about images, action, and sound, not just words or chatter boxes like you. A flash of pixels and not words create a perfect image that no one will forget in any game. <P>You made a sad attempt trying to muck with me with your pitiful comeback that took at least two weeks. Sorry, you’re a little late.<P>I said, “What if you can not rip the face off if they are in town?”<P>There are times in gaming that a person knows they killed someone out of just plain luck and will not go on harms way so they just stay in town where it is safe. So the chance to get revenge in a game is slim to none which is the sad truth when facing shit talkers. <P>Come back when you have some real proof then I will in fact stop replying in a timely manner.

         Um, took me 3 seconds.  I don’t hang out on the KAAOS boards like you do.  In fact, I check them out about once every year to see if they are still up.<P>And a punk! Oh no, I’ve been called a punk! <P><i> I am able to make a “point” and get to the root of the question long before KAAOS will even attempt to answer. Sometimes I refrain from posting my solutions I get. This is because there may be many solutions that can be carried out. It is up to the reader to come up with their best resolve and not just my solution that I think is best. My solution could be the opposite of your solution since there can be quite a lot of good choices to use while gaming<BR></i><BR>Uh huh, and the point of the above was?? Not much. You were trying to make a point about being able to make a point but you got sidetracked on creating solutions but you’re so fast at creating those but all solutions are equal and sometimes you don’t post your solutions because you’re afraid they’ll show that you’re a fucking idiot and what the fuck did I just say because all that equals up to showing everyone here that you’re a blowhard point missing clueless fuckhead.<P>Did I make my point? Dip.<P>All your responses go on and on like that in the same manner.  Most of your post I skip entirely.  I just assume you don’t make any worthwhile conclusions.  In fact, you didn’t even come to a conclusion about you being a point missing fuckhead.  You wandered off and didn’t come back.  <P>Now, No one is getting useful information from you because you are not providing information valid to the arguments at hand.  You are CONSTANTLY using wrong definitions.  You quote backwoods articles written by morons then you take those out of context (And yes that was out of context you clueless fuck.  Those terms were defined in that article specifically for “attacker” vs. “victim” fighting.  When those same terms are applied to different types of fights they take on NEW MEANING.  For instance, counter-tactic means a series of moves that will negate/repel/or take advantage of an offensive attack.  Not that shit for brains definition you gave above.  Heck, counter-attack normally means an attack that takes advantage of a certain type of offensive attack!).   Nothing I’ve heard you say tries to clarify anything.  Heck, in that other thread you had to back down and you STILL wouldn’t admit to being wrong.  Half-right my fucking ass.  pfft.  You’re worthless.<P><i><BR>People create an image by an image (something they saw).).<BR></i><BR>No, an image, even a mental image of what you just saw, is a reproduction of an object interpreted by your mind.  But alas, we are talking about an image that means the opinion or concept of something that is held by the public.  Like the common opinion that you are a waste of space monkey boy that was probably created by some junior college bio-chem students in Missouri to see what life is like without a brain. <P>Now that you got the correct definition and a nice example of it, go reread my post you fucking twit. <P>Now that you have done that (and trust me, with your limited brain power you’ll need to go back up there a few times to fully understand) I’ll go on and abuse the rest of that piece of crap you probably thought was a good argument.<P><i><BR>The proof of the image is in the death and destruction the player makes while in action. Games are about images, action, and sound, not just words or chatter boxes like you. A flash of pixels and not words create a perfect image that no one will forget in any game.<BR></i><P>First, only you and a couple others will see that one image, and interpretations of it are up for grabs.  Second being killed by someone in today’s games is rarely a “that guy was so much better then me” situation.  Most of the time kills are ganks/jumps/double teams, sure they are fun, but are they worth getting upset over? No.  They don’t tarnish your image, everyone knows they are meaningless.  If you are stupid enough to get upset by dying in modern games you really shouldn’t be playing them.  <P>And as for not being able to avenge yourself because the guy is hiding in town, get the fuck over it.  All you’re doing is making the guy that killed you laugh harder.  Heck, I’m laughing with him.  Ha ha ha ha.  I bet you spent hours waiting for him.  Ha ha ha. <P>Dip.<P>Dethan D’Istir<BR>

But that is not the real way to play any RPG. People create a real image by an image or action within a game. That is what games are made and designed for 99% of the time, if not more. My point was made here since you missed it:  Games are about images, action, and sound, not just words or chatter boxes like you. These words will not be as remember able as much as the actions in a game. This paper image or what you call a mental image is worthless in any game except for the Sims game which is dependant on gay chatter and a nice house. <P>Me saying that you are a punk was on target because you have a low self image. You do not want to receive help from anyone on this forum and you feel that talking in a game or laughing will change things. I never said that I would wait for someone to go out of town which is another assumption on your part. You did not say what kind of image that was created in your original post and made a bad comeback trying to fix it up to boot so we are even.<P><BR>Now you try to downplay the rest of my points with this garbage, “First, only you and a couple others will see that one image, and interpretations of it are up for grabs.”<P>Over time with many hours of ownage, these images will eventually show up with many fights. Many people will want you to be on their side after a while.<P>Now I was able to respond without using words like fuck, I am so pleased.

         um, LMAO<P>Four responses and none of them make enough sense to respond too.<P>Oh my, this is funny. <BR>I’m just going to comment on the things that amuse me the most.<BR><i><BR>Wow, I am so glad you can explain yourself. But that is not the real way to play any RPG. People create a real image by an image or action within a game. That is what games are made and designed for 99% of the time, if not more.<BR></i><BR>Monkey boy, why don’t you explain yourself here since I was nice enough to?  “People create a real image by an image” makes you sound like a retard.  Wait, nevermind.  And games are made and designed for people to create a real image? Just rewrite this entire section.  That or better yet have someone else write it for you.<BR><i><BR>Me saying that you are a punk was on target because you have a low self image.<BR></i><BR>Um, this is amusing.  Actually, I have a rather healthy self image.  It is propped up on awards, trophies, titles, and prize money.<BR><i><BR>You did not say what kind of image that was created in your original post and made a bad comeback trying to fix it up to boot so we are even.<BR></i><BR>Huh?  If you had taken the time to look at Karst’s post that I originally took the question from you’d of known we were talking about a respect in regard to PVP skills and the opinion of the online community about those skills.  How like you to jump into a discussion that you didn’t take the time to familiarize yourself with.<BR><i><BR>Over time with many hours of ownage, these images will eventually show up with many fights. Many people will want you to be on their side after a while.<BR></i><BR>You saying ownage is funny.  Anyway, when you say “these images will eventually show up with many fights” reminds me of this one guy that screen capped already dead corpses and posted them as wins.  Look, I won all these people!!  I got the images! I got the Pixels! I must have done it!  Similarly, if you wanted to be seen as a winner you could take pictures of all your wins.  Of course, if you lose 3 of every 4 fights you are still a loser, but if you play enough “eventually” you’ll get a nice bunch of images you can point to and go “see, I’m not a waste of space loser, really I’m not”.  <P>An image without perspective is deceiving and the only way to get perspective is through “talking”.  I know, new concept.  Think on it a little.<BR><i><BR>The public images that you think is created by talking is nothing compared to a mental action image that is shown each time you win a fight or long battle. I’m not sure what kind of games you played that showed a player as a contender just by the way they chat<BR></i><BR>Mental action image, ha ha ha.  I don’t even think you know what you’re trying to say with that.  When did I ever say the guy was a contender?  Putting words in my mouth now Monkey Boy?  That is the last act of the desperate and the stupid, and you are both.  I said, “And it is easy for some guy that knows a few PVP tricks to come in and fool an entire group of players into thinking he’s Gods gift to PVP.”<BR><i><BR>I can’t recall a person winning a fight with chat, only weapons…. ROFL!!!!<BR></i><BR>That is because you don’t know me.  If you did you’d know I win a lot of my fights by pissing people off so they make irrational decisions.  Talking is an offensive weapon sharper then any sword.<P><i><BR>A public image reinforced with action would be the best way to build a strong public image.<BR></i><BR>Let me see, no duh.  It took you 3 posts to come to the same conclusion that I alluded to in my original post. WTG.  Next time you feel like responding to me just go “blah blah blah I’m a fucking idiot.  Dethan is right after all”, and we’ll get along just fine.<P>Dip.<P>Dethan D’Istir<BR>

         It is like I said before; everyone has their own solution for any problem. But you think (as the bonehead you are) that your way is best. <P>I can not agree on the talking part and I never will. It seems like a punk’s way to me if you wanted to talk to me when fighting. Talking rarely happened in mid-evil times during a fight; before a fight but never during a fight on my side of the conversation. But at least I am trying to see your side of the argument. Talking could happen after a fight but is not encouraged in Ultima. Most times it would get a person in trouble.<P> Ok here you mess up again trying to pick and choose half a sentence, try to pick the whole sentence like this: People create a real image by an image or action within a game. People know who you are by the actions you do and not just words on a screen. What can words on a screen do? Absolutely nothing unless you have special diplomacy skills I don’t know about. <img src="http://www.kaaos.com/htdocs/dcforum/Images/tongue.gif"> When you have the skills it shows every single time you play. That is what distinguishes a punk from a hero. How else can I strengthen the point I have? It is up to the players to incorporate chat but it is not a big deal since you are just another fighter until you have ownage. Which brings be to these last thoughts. <P>1.	Designers with online multiplayer games let the players decide to chat or not, but this does not give me special diplomacy skills.<BR>2.	 That brings me to the last part of the fight. Most times they would run away before I had a chance to say “coward” or “come back for your loot”. So chat is cheap and actions are priceless in any real game.<P><BR>I never said my way was the best but it works for me. You can't build a strong self image or public image by taking a few selected still shots from a screen. You try so hard to make me look stupid but it is you that looks stupid bringing that bullshit up. It is about winning the crowd just like the Gladiator movie and not taking inventory of your winnings.<P>Decapitate that bitch.

         Ok.  I’ll decapitate you, but I don’t think it’ll have an effect on your posting ability since you don’t use your head anyway.<BR><i><BR>It is like I said before; everyone has their own solution for any problem. But you think (as the bonehead you are) that your way is best.<BR></i><P>Um, you don’t even know what the discussions about do you?  You are just coasting on fumes. The discussion IS about IF someone can create a respected PVP image with average skill and a lot of talk.  The answer is yes. People do it all the time.  It is a fact.  Not a DEBATE.  I never said it was the way to go about doing it, I was saying that people do it.  That it can and has been done.  Heck, in the current sad state of online gaming these types of players are the majority!  Every idiot with a maxed char and the kewl leet items thinks they are the shiit and most of the online community morons believe them.<P>You are an idiot for even TRYING to debate this with me.<P>You are more of an idiot to jump to the assumption that that is my playing style, especially after the original post where my tone was decidedly AGAINST how these people got their reputation.<P>As for the rest of your post, it is a fucking hoot.  You made it sound like you fought during medieval times.  You made chat systems in online games seem like unnecessary features.  Then you try and pull out this it is all opinion, everyone has their own solution, “I never said my way was the best way”, type of idiocy that only shows you don’t know what we were talking about to begin with.  Laughing at you is becoming addicting.<P>Dethan<P>

         Dethan my troubled boy, I am not a moron; I just can’t stomach some of this junk you have brought out trying to help people understand what it is to be godlike in a game. Everyone knows that it takes hard work and time to get to godlike status. There is no special fairy dust or trick used. I gave Karst a much better explanation on how to be godlike than everyone combined.<P>You on the other hand are a moron because you try to get the general public opinion which is not even true. Dethan wrote, “Actually, you can create an image with talk. People are easily fooled by blowhard wannabe’s. Rarely do the masses know who the best PVP players are.” <P>Then you try to do that very thing being the punk you are here: Dethan wrote, “That is because you don’t know me. If you did you’d know I win a lot of my fights by pissing people off so they make irrational decisions. Talking is an offensive weapon sharper then any sword.”<P>You try to do what you think the majority of people do because you were lied to by a couple punks. You were told that you can create a good image by fight/talking. Guess what, KAAOS does not do what the majority of people do or what you call the masses. They do not try trickery with words but prove by actions and many hours of practice. That is what makes them better than the average player with turn based games. Talking would simply be for your own pleasure and not any kind of tactic with turn based games. The only kind of chat that would work would have to be ALL KILL, being a command with taming. So that chat command would be the only phrase that would work. <P>True some players may be fooled by someone trying to be a leader or being godlike, but it will take time for me to trust someone’s leadership and pvp skills. Only the dumbest or newest players get excited over someone else’s ability till they themselves get some good abilities in a certain game. The masses will know who the best PVP players are over time as well or at least some skilled ones that are average. But to be fooled to think that a player is godlike is the extreme. So no, people are generally not easily fooled by blowhard wannabe’s once they get to know the game. <P>And Peon was one of the best if not THE best pvper in Ultima. I once helped kill him off and got 1k silver. He was able to beat my nephew Steagus. He was talked about with many guilds and well known when I was playing. I knew who the best PVP players were which is more positive than your shitload of lies you brought here about the masses.<P>Try not to read my posts because you’re too much of a bonehead to stay away.

         Sigh.  I hate idiots.<P>You miss quote, you put words in my mouth, and now you’re falling back onto a mysterious “I once killed the best PVP’er with some help” story that has nothing to do with anything.  Did I bring up the fact that I not only killed an NWN legend, but I made him turn himself into a gnome?  Did I bring up the fact that I turned a lot of great players into gnomes?  Did I sit and flaunt my trophy room? Did I bring up the fact that I’m probably a PVP legend myself? No, I didn’t.  Why, because it doesn’t fucking matter in this discussion.  So shut the fuck up, you’re trying to prop yourself up on someone else’s reputation and that is EXACTLY how people who don’t deserve PVP reputations try to get theirs.  BTW, doing that tactic in a post makes you a hypocrite.  You are doing what you say you’d never do.  You are trying to use talk to get a PVP reputation.<BR><i><BR>Guess what, KAAOS does not do what the majority of people do or what you call the masses. they do not try trickery with words but prove by actions and many hours of practice.<BR></i><BR>LMAO!!!!!!!!!  Yeah, I’m still addicted to laughing at you.<P>You don’t have a clue about KAAOS.  Sure, they don’t do what the masses do; they do everything the masses wouldn’t even think of doing and more.  BTW, that includes talking during fights!  Yes, I’ve seen KAAOS members talk during fights to upset the other players so they make mistakes!   I’ve even seen KAAOS members win fights through the use of verbal abuse!  I’m an eyewitness!  <BR><i><BR>Talking would simply be for your own pleasure and not any kind of tactic with turn based games.<BR></i><BR>Wow, you know nothing about turn based games.  And definitely nothing about turn based multiplayer fights.  Talking is what coordinated the attacks.  Without talking you couldn’t describe anything going on in a multiplayer turn based fight as tactical.<BR><i><BR>The masses will know who the best PVP players are over time as well or at least some skilled ones that are average.<BR></i><BR>I beg to differ.  I come from a small online gaming community and I’d be willing to say that 90% of the masses from that community couldn’t tell a great PVP’er from a good one.  They wouldn’t know what skill set’s to look for to differentiate the two.   If they had a clue what to look for then they’d be the great PVP’ers and not average gamers.  I’m sure the same can be said for UO, and with the larger more dispersed community that UO has that % is probably a bit higher.<P>This kind of brings us to a discussion on how to gauge a “godlike” player in current online gaming environments.  This is a hard thing to do without set PVP events like ladders and tournaments.  In fact, it is pretty impossible.  You can say roughly who’s a good gamer, and maybe whose better then you at PVP, but in terms of godlike in the entire game you need a larger reference point then just your own abilities and experiences.  You need to understand that what you know, or more importantly what you don’t know, limits your ability to gauge other players’ skill level.<P>Dethan<BR>

         Online gaming is more about social interactions then explosions and death.  If you are not going to talk to the other players you are nothing but a NPC to everyone else in the game.

This is a hard thing to do without set PVP events like ladders and tournaments. In fact, it is pretty impossible. You can say roughly who’s a good gamer, and maybe whose better then you at PVP, but in terms of godlike in the entire game you need a larger reference point then just your own abilities and experiences. You need to understand that what you know, or more importantly what you don’t know, limits your ability to gauge other players’ skill level."<P>Ultima Online did have tournaments on a large scale with guilds. These guilds would help factions take over towns. So you can know which guilds were the best in Ultima at that time.<P>Well, this brings us to the fucking gauge you wrote about. Ultima Online did have these tournaments FYI. A combination of experiences, tournaments, and faction wars were the deciding factor for godlike character classification.
