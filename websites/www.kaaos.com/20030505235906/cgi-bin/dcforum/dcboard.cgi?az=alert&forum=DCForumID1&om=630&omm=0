After Elric started some lies about me being a bad player of Ultima I then had a comment by Malice of course. This guy has tried many times to make me mad for some strange reason. It wont work becouse I was met with much greater hostilities when I made my first post with my application. Was it my fault that the person who started the forum was too dumb to set up a running application form. 

Here I have proof that Malice is more of a troll. He wants to start shit but of course never finishes backing it up.

Malice - "you have no friends in this clan. hell the only bearing you have is a fucking beggar status. this is a poor sad attempt to make a friend.

Very thought out here so I better make another responce since the first one went unchallenged. I was in fact invited by Mike Reveal who is apart of the high ranks. Why do you make assumptions about stuff you have no clue about? You can even ask him if he was in fact my friend. He has been on my icq messanger for four years. 

Malice will not change his ethics but at least I know he is in fact a liar.
