         There is much I could say to this thread, but most of it would be pointless. Actually, it's all pointless, but I have some points to make anyway.<BR>---<P>"I have in fact gotten some info on what makes a good guild and I do know what kind of guild or group of players these KAAOS people are. It is about making the game your own and having your own rules or strategy to boot. And it’s about no rules."<P>There is only so much you can see from reading posts on a forum. I don't "know" them, and I don't want to, but I can see, as Sachant says, that "they are more than they seem." I can also see that <i>they are how they are</i>, and no good can come of trying to change them. The difference between our power of sight is that you are here to preach, while I am here to learn. There is much even a goodie can learn from the forces of darkness, not least that there is more to everything than meets the eye.<P>While there are no "rules" in the normal sense, if you look more carefully, there is something there. First there is the written ideology, which again, is more than it seems. Then there are clear statements of principle at many points on this board. There are other things too. I'm not going to point out any specifics though; they are for the individual to see or not to see. It's to do with what Sachant said, "Just don't expect them to jump through hoops to prove it to you." If you want to see, you have to look. Remember the old saying, "Knowledge speaks; wisdom listens." Perhaps I blind myself somewhat by preaching to you as I do, indeed that is partly why I try not to... but sometimes the situation is just so rediculous...<P>---<P>"I am not trying to be a troll; I am trying to make good productive topics since there are none to begin with."<P>There were very few topics to begin with, and the proportion of productive ones was as large as on any other forum. It is only now that the majority of topics go nowhere.<P>If you really want to fight, and to try and change people, why not find some other people to fight with? Why not go somewhere where you might be able to make a difference?<BR>For an example, have a read at <a href="http://www.scapeboard.com/2/viewforum.php?f=7" target="_blank">http://www.scapeboard.com/2/viewforum.php?f=7</a><BR>Most of the people there, if you asked them, would say they were "good". But their posts tend to suggest otherwise. Leave alone those who are happy to be evil, and go for the hypocrites who are evil but convinced they are not.
