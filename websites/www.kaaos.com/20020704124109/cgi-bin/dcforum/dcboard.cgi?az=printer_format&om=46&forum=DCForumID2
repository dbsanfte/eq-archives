<blockquote>He awoke in the darkest of the night as he had each night for the past thirty or more.<P>He rose slowly, passing his hand over sleep filled eyes, struggling to wake up fully and rid his mind of the hideous whispers with which it was once again filled...<P>The sound of another's breathing reminded him that he wasn't alone last night and that, no matter how sated or exhausted he was, these nightmares plaguing him would not desist.  <P>The young woman lying in his bed was rather plain and <i>(until last night)</i> quite virtuous, but for some reason he couldn't guess Sagen always preferred to wheedle his way into an innocent's bed.  Certainly it was more work than a quick tumble with a tavern wench, but the benefits far outweighed the inconvenience.<P>The challenge of getting a righteous young lady to lift her skirts was an amusement that he never tired of, and watching their behavior the morning after was quite often hilarious.  When he bothered to stay until morning that is.  <P>Even as he was chuckling to himself over his good fortune, his hands were already placing his few scattered belongings in his pack.  He'd bruised this one quite a bit, and lately he'd begun thinking that instead of leaving quickly and quitely as usual, perhaps he should simply take his dirk and have a little fun "quieting" his conquests in a more leisurely manner.  <P>The Gods alone knew what was the matter with him, for he certainly didn't.  Raised by a single, loving mother he was brought up to believe so very differently.  She could definitely be over protective, and her eyes flashed whenever the words "father" escaped his lips.  He'd quickly learned to stifle that particular curiosity, and would have gladly stayed in their small town forever if not for the disturbing thoughts and increasingly sadistic turns his mind was taking.<P>He'd been gone close to a year now.  The thoughts simply got darker, and the tempatation more difficult to resist with each passing day.  He no longer fought to make a living, but for the pure pleasure of watching his opponents eyes as the life slipped from their bodies.  He chose daggers as his specialty, so he could feel the blood gushing and sliding warmly over his hands as he ended the lives of his enemies.  Mercenary work and fufilling assassination contracts agreed with him, and it filled a place in his soul that he never realized existed.<P>This new thing with the women was disturbing, but not surprising to him.  He knew it was only a matter of time before he gave into the craving to end an evening of sexual conquest with the sounds of shrieking in his ears, the sight of his helpless victim grovelling at his feet for her pathetic life.<P>He knew the nightmares were tied to it somehow.  But unless he was going mad, there was no way to know what they meant or why he was having them.<P>They were always the same...  A dank cellar or dungeon, the smell so foul that one would almost beg for death to be rid of it...  a cage of some sort... not quite wire, there appeared to be little barbs on the bars...  a man hovering...  small fingers wrapped around a cross <i>(but it was too grotesque to be a cross!)</i> of some sort...<P>And those words, whispered in a soft voice...  the words that sent pure terror racing through his mind...<P>"No child, don't cry.  Your tears only boil away on the twisted cross.  It's your blood that soaks in deep.  Your blood."<BR></blockquote><hr><b><font size=2>Table of contents</font></b><hr>
