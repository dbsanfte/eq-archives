              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">These things 
                pour from the veins of the dying. The human force - fired and 
                tempered, boiled and extracted, concentrated and eviscerated from 
                the body like the guts being pulled from cattle for the slaughter. 
                Long messy strings of the essence of life yanked out fistful by 
                fistful, dripping with the blood and slop of the creature giving 
                up its spark. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">These are

                are the things that stand above every other human experience.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">When a mortal 
                slumbers, these things... THEY are what is felt in the deep night 
                of sleep.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Sleep, that 
                mimicry of death. Even death is pierced by suffering. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">These things.... 
                these things.... they matter. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">And this 
                is a fact. A fact that The False Prophet had come to know. But 
                it had not been easy to learn.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> --------------------------------------------------------------------------------</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> Fire from 
                a thousand pits. That was all his eyes saw. Fire from a thousand 
                pits, burning on the fuels of rage and loss and pain and grief. 
                The smoke that curled into the air was greasy and black with the 
                despair of those who roasted in the fires below. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">This was 
                the world. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">This was 
                the wreckage of the world.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> His nostrils 
                flared as he drew in the smell of destruction, and the sky was 
                red to him, and his soul was dark to him. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Yaas.... 
                </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Hedron stood 
                in the crushed ruin of a temple, outlined in shadow and firelight 
                against the night. His body was taut with a power that he had 
                held contained for centuries. His hands gripped and ungripped 
                in a wrestles kind of ritual, and he turned toward the boy. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The boy, 
                for his part, looked up at Hedron with confused, but confident 
                eyes. After all that had happened, this boy still trusted Hedron, 
                still trusted The Prophet. And this boy was the very last. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">But the child 
                knew he was safe. It was this immortal being, The Prophet, who 
                had built, guided and ruled the land for longer than any living 
                memory or written record stretched back. The Prophet had ruled 
                since eons before this boy had come from the ether of pre-birth. 
                He had ruled for so long that the trust of the people was like 
                a religion. The people believed in him. Had believed in him. Unquestionably. 
                </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">But their 
                lord had been quiet for centuries, and when he reappeared to the 
                people, he was almost... almost a legend. Old men and women had 
                long dead grandparents who had last seen The Prophet in flesh, 
                and they told tales of him to their grandchildren. Grandchildren 
                who were now grandparents themselves, and were the last to know 
                direct reports of the glorious Prophet. When he reappeared the 
                people revered him as they had before, feeling at last that a 
                piece they had been missing had come back into place. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">It wasn’t 
                until after they were dead that their severed souls began to question 
                what had happened.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> And now 
                here was the last of the people. A child before his... his God. 
                There was no other way to put it.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> Hedron crouched 
                down low, and faced the boy. “Child,” he whispered, “do you know 
                why men build?” </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The child 
                shook his head. “Child, men build because they know they are mortal. 
                They seek to make something greater than themselves. Something 
                great enough to carry their essence, some part of themselves, 
                down through the ages.” The child watched, and listened, but he 
                did not understand. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">“And so men 
                build, child. And I have seen the results of their work. Do you 
                know what that result is? It is nothing. Statues, monuments, temples, 
                ideas, religions, art, literature, laws, governments. All of it 
                becomes dust eventually. Oh, something new is always built, but 
                nothing nothing nothing lasts. Did you know that child?” The child 
                shook his head no. He had not known that, but now that his Prophet 
                had told him, now he knew it. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Hedron smiled, 
                somehow cruelly, and said “But there is one thing that lasts. 
                I last. I have endured. Throughout time I have existed, and all 
                things inside me have existed, and all things without me crumble.” 
                </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Hedron reached 
                out one hand and took the arm of the child and led him deeper 
                into the heart of the temple they were in. “This is the center 
                of the Land. This temple is where the heart and soul of the entire 
                People rests. Come with me and I will show it to you.” </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">They walked 
                together, the image of a father and his son. Stone columns that 
                had collapsed made grinding noises as they parted before the two 
                and debris cleared itself away. The two of them eventually reached 
                the nexus of the temple, and gazed at a brightly throbbing Cross, 
                its white light bathing them. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The light 
                rested on the child like the hand of a mother, and it glared off 
                of Hedron The Prophet like his touch revolted it. Hedron reached 
                out a gray gloved hand, and tore the cross from the deep rich 
                earth it was rooted in, and hefted it like a mace. The white light 
                grayed and dimmed at his touch, and the cross almost seemed to... 
                to whimper. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">“Child, do 
                you know what the People have made that will last forever? They 
                have made the memory of their suffering and death root itself 
                in my mind. And I, and my memory, will live forever. Do you understand 
                that in dying, the People have finally achieved the immortality 
                that all their building could never grant them?”</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> The child, 
                for the first time, waned in his worship of The Prophet, and his 
                eyes cleared. He looked at Hedron, really looked at Hedron. He 
                looked at the set of his mouth, the piercing of his eyes. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The silence 
                was unbearable and unbreakable in the way that the weight of a 
                deep cavern collapsing on a man might be unbearable and unbreakable. 
                No matter how desperate the need to do away with it, it would 
                not break. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">But break 
                it did. And it broke with tears. They streamed down the child’s 
                face. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Hedron had 
                what he wanted. “Yes, Child. I have chosen you, the last of the 
                People, to know it. To know more than the agony of torture, and 
                the despair of death that I gave to the others. I have chosen 
                you to know betrayal. I have betrayed you.” </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The child’s 
                face flowed with tears, and a small sob broke his clenched jaw 
                open. Hedron whispered... “No child. Don’t cry. Your tears only 
                boil away on the Twisted Cross. It’s your blood that soaks in 
                deep.... your blood.” </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Hedron reached 
                under the chin of the boy, and tightened his grip. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">“NOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!” 
                </font></p>

              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">A crunch 
                as the cross that had been pulled from the ground and pulled from 
                the heart of the Land by Hedron smashed into the head of the boy, 
                the last of the People. As it struck, the white light died, and 
                the arms of the cross were twisted horribly by the impact with 
                the skull. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The Twisted 
                Cross was born as Hedron absorbed from the child all that was 
                the People and the Land. And he whispered again from between ragged 
                breaths...</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> “I am Hedron. 
                The Prophet is no more. I am The False Prophet.” His shuddering, 
                convulsing body crashed to the ground, and the Twisted Cross melted 
                itself into his soul, making itself and its sins his companion 
                forever. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Later, much 
                later, he rose, and moved on toward other worlds. The Twisted 
                Cross swung at his side, and the cruel power of the destruction 
                of a world hid in his body. </font></p>
