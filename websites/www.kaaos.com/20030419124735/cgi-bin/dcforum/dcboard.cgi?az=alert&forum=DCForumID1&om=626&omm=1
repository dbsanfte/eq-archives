Sup Messer...This is Kad...i lurk these boards now and again to see if anyone i know shows up....gnorn did a while back.

I am in Shadowbane beta right now....though still killing stupid AI mobs at the moment trying to level up so i can check out the real deal.

Leveling is pretty quick....at least sub 20....which is where im still at. Once you get the feel of the game....with a good group ou could level to 20 in a weekend pretty easy. i went from level 6 to 17 in about 7 hours of playtime or so....and thats with me looking around for groups and stuff.

actually im kinda interested whether or not KAAOS is planning on checking this game out. I had thought they were in  beta....but havent seen dick about it on the boards...but then...i just read the general forum every now and then. I kinda got the impression they just kinda gave up on the game after all the delays. 

Though I did see a post recently on SB beta boards by Hedron....so who knows.

Last i heard Benign was without internet....but thats been a while. Joker i think is playing BF 1942 and i have not seen or heard about Pig or Galorious.

As far as Shadowbane goes...if it lives up to the crap i read by Bonedancer....I think it might be a good game. Will find out more as i get further along in beta.

If it does turn out good....I'd be happy to hook up with any of the old WB and kick some ass, or for that matter ...any KAAOS'ers that end up playing it. Though I  only know the same guys you do from KAAOS.


Keep in touch with me as it gets closer to release at Tusc@cox.net and we will see what happens.
