      <P></B></FONT><FONT face=Arial size=-1>In the existence of video games, 
      the great majority of them, have been of some competetive nature, of 
      sorts. Whether it be a fighting game, strategy game, sport game, action 
      game, adventure game, or RPG style game... the one thing that all of these 
      have in common is that it pits players against players in a competetive 
      environment. With that being said, I cannot understand why the main focus 
      of a massive multiplayer game should NOT be combat oriented. The idea of 
      gaining virtual money and virtual real estate, of gaining cool items, and 
      the like, while being a necessary part of the gaming environment, these 
      types of things should NOT be a central focus. Now, that is not to say 
      that roleplay has no part in gaming. In fact, the complete opposite is 
      true, roleplay is essential to gaming. But the nature of this roleplay 
      should not be geared only towards happy trading between people, buying 
      houses, and being fishermen. Instead, one must realize that the whole 
      reason fantasy worlds exist is to teleport the player into a peril fraught 
      world, one where dragons roam free, one where you can slit your neighbor's 
      throat and no one will care too much, and one where you are constantly in 
      a struggle for survival. 
      <P>After having said all that, these 10 components are what strike me as 
      the most essential components which would be necessary in creating the 
      perfect game.
      <P><B>I. The Turn-Based Environment</B>
      <P>Since combat, struggle, and survival are the key underlying themes to 
      the world, a turn based environment is needed. This environment provides 
      those involved with a small, finite period of time in which they have the 
      ability to think, plan, communicate, and then act. The turn based 
      environment provides for a fair way of giving each person time to think, 
      act, and react. This type of environment eliminates the problems of lag, 
      ping times, bad connections, and quick twitch reflexes (ie, the click-fest 
      which many games have become).
      <P><B>II. Strategical Combat (PvP)</B>
      <P>From the turn based environment, strategic PvP will develop (assuming 
      III. IV. and V. have been met). Strategic PvP grows from the ability of 
      each person not having to rely on quick clicking ability, but rather on 
      their wits and tactical skill. Since the world and combat space are a 
      finite space, it becomes like a game of chess, one players moves, the 
      other player reacts, until there is a victor. The victor is the person who 
      showed mastery of the terrain, his weapons, and of being able to out 
      battle his opponent. Strategical combat also requires: 
      <P><B>III. Defensive/Counter Attacks</B>
      <P>By this I mean that for most (preferrably all) possible attacks, that 
      the opponent has some sort of option (whether he chooses to take it or not 
      is up to him) whereby he could divert or minimize the attack against him. 
      This is a system of balancing powerful attacks with powerful defenses, 
      something which the games of recent have ignored. One cannot hope to have 
      Strategical Combat when an opponent can throw a 2000 points of damage 
      spell that has no chance of being minimized, other than by sheer luck. 
      This system of checks and balances provides for a more strategical 
      environment. Again, in chess, each pieces has its strengths, each piece 
      has its weaknesses. Other pieces exploit these weaknesses, or divert their 
      strengths.
      <P><B>IV. Attainable Peaks (Levels)</B>
      <P>First, there must be a set limit to how high of a level one can attain. 
      Second, the highest levels must be attainable in a reasonable amount of 
      time. Only when the players have peaked out in the tedium of their 
      character's level can the above mentioned combat take place. 
      <P><B>V. The Level Playing Field</B>
      <P>Since everyone will be able to reach their maximum level without years 
      of playing, and assuming that III. is taken into account, everyone will be 
      on a more or less level field. Balance will exist because of III. and IV. 
      thus making the combat meaningful. This leads to the next key factor:
      <P><B>VI. The Drive for Power and Respect</B>
      <P>Whereas in recent games (as people have mentioned recently on this 
      board) the drive behind the players was to acquire money, equipment or 
      other "material" possessions, this, in fact, is detrimental to the gaming 
      environment. This promotes random acts of killing and only random acts of 
      killing. The drive for loot destroys the hopes of the strategic combat. 
      Instead of this drive for loot, it is important that the notion of power, 
      skill, and respect be part of the environment. Organized events (combat 
      oriented, guild oriented, problem solving events, etc) are a means to 
      producing a heirarchy amongst the various guilds and players. The drive 
      should be to become the best and most respected, not to become the 
richest.
      <P><B>VII. Roleplay</B>
      <P>Sprouting from the turn based gaming environment, roleplay can 
      flourish. Since players don't need to worry about being jumped as they sit 
      at a zone gate and don't need to worry about getting the "click, click, 
      click" death of UO and EQ. Instead, should a combat situation occur, since 
      the combat is turn based, the encounter can be roleplayed instead of 
      having to react and flee or whatever. Also, aside from the combat based 
      roleplay, general roleplay is also necessary. This roleply can be largely 
      based on VI. and the power of the different guilds and respect that has 
      been awarded to the prominent players. Roleplay also helps the community 
      grow.
      <P><B>VIII. A Central Messaging System</B>
      <P>Important to the development of VI. and VII. and the community, there 
      needs to be a centralized message board system. This is key for outside 
      the game roleplaying, It is important that everyone knows where to find 
      out about the other guilds, their goings on, their players, and it is a 
      good place for in game events to be developed and discussed.
      <P><B>IX. A Quality Chat Engine</B>
      <P>The chat engine must be exemplary. There need not be any shout commands 
      or ooc commands that broadcast to the whole world, but there needs to be 
      private messages and an easy to read and contribute to chat window/engine. 
      The chat is important to both roleplay and pvp. PvP, like roleplay, 
      requires communication. Without communication, the game loses a part of 
      it's strategy and it also loses part of it's community. With a chat engine 
      like ultima online's, the community can never develop. 
      <P><B>X. Community Events (Quests)</B>
      <P>The community of the game needs to be developed. Many of these factors 
      contribute to the development of the aforementioned community. As the 
      community develops, it is possible to have meaningful events in the game, 
      quests, and other adventures. Guild on guild combat, team combat, pvp 
      ladders, and the like are all a part of this and are all necessary for the 
      game to be the ideal game. NPCs and AI only offer so much challenge and 
      get quite boring very quickly. With players becoming a major factor in the 
      game, and with the communal heirarchy developing and constantly being 
      challenged and rewritten, this allows for the game to be complete. It now 
      has the ideal combat and the ideal community and thus, it is the ideal 
      game. 
      <P>PvP, Roleplay, and Community need to develop in the proper way, or the 
      game will not be ideal, and will flop. All three are important and all 
      three are interrelated. None can be sacrificed, all must be present.
