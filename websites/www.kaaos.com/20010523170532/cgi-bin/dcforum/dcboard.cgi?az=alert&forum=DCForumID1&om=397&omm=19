----------------------------------------------------
Poetic gibberish, of my wicked venture:

Vortex of burning leaves dancing round the horror filled tables 

A faceless man behind the goat shaped mask, reading tales of ancient fables.  

Lust mord what lust, er lust to greed and back to dust.  

Take shape, my night. 

Stories told from milleniums past, stories from our youth, of those glorious times, and those to cum, I revel your passion with my fork shaped tongue, Sombre poems, noveltry written in blood, unveiling the truth.

Er mighty raven flies in my blackened sky, oh wicked seductress, decayed to vanity in my bestial gasm for the nite. 

In the sky a message of time to come, a time ruled by witches and vampires, lifeless angels and demons, a time when all that is holy is washed to dust, a time undone. 

And only when uve cast aside your doubts, will you become one of us, that of Kaaos, sinister dark, gore filled violation of passionate trust, To become one with the kindred, the blasphemous horde of terror, unfaithful just.

I stand in the pentagram invoking my demon soul rise, in the light of a thousand deaths, blood shed before my eyes, Blacked burned messiah, hold me fast, guide me through the kingdom to a time long past....
for Ive died a thousand times..

Murder, filth, forsaken bones of warriors damned in vulpine reform of my blades, my eyes closed wide open, I step into my namesake, the ravenous demons call my name, Lord Abyssos we adore you, oh evil, you have arrived... 
Evil we adore you 
Oh Evil... gone are those once denied.

Show me the blood I drink as wine, show me the life once trapped inside...

My red wine of your virgin blood, fell forth her female legs, darkest heart desire made flesh, kiss me one last time, those sweet velvet lips, carved symbols deep into my pale skin, your desire pierced deep within, ill suck you dry, your life force devious and old, a force now mine. 

Come my child and bathe in blood, of my animal instinct, my pleasure, my fun.

As lightning rips the sky, fear my terror, ground covered in snow, witness the All-Father cry, or tears of sorrow never touched your nimble earth, slashed within, your gut, your gearth, hold close that which is dear, your darkest secrets, your greatest fear, turn back to where you once spawned, as the moon reflects the frozen wastelands, reborn your age of dawn, as the earth is swalled by my darkness.

And your soul ascends, into my final oblivion, which hath no end, for mothers tears shant was away doubt, times past saved for you now, your course is nigh, ShemHamForash, ultimate da-mnation. 

Remember the time long forgotten, angels did fall from the sky, the fire breathing whore of vengeance, anger, and lies. My departure is darkness and the resurection reborn. Effigy of my forgotten, heathen, blasphemer, torn. Cast the moonspell into wisdom, and witness the power unknown, you who rule the night.

Carnal lust, revocation of creation lost, fullmoon to light my path, symbiot evil your soul the cost, of fire and fog, ancient wings that carry the oath, dripped blood from a thunderous sky, a fortress so crystal clear, of obsideon ice. Take the form of justice, and walk the sombrelain, awake your fears,  to the lands traveled once again. Your soul now black, slandered, and red, you belong to us now, demon lord of the dead.

O' corrupted minds that walk in hands, summoned by prowress with the vengeful dammned, these words you have heard nothing, despair. 

Release unto me final judgement
Forever your wicked desciple 

Abyssos.

- Upon the Ebon throne of Dark delight
