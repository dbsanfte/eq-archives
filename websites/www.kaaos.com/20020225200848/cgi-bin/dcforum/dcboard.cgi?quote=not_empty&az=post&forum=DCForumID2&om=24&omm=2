         as Sinath stared at the coin he wondered what all the tiny detailed etchings meant, for this was not a coin someone would wish to own as a item of value, the coin had an essence of darkness surrounding it, a glimmer of fate. Sinath grinned and his eyes glowed bright once more. He turned down the path once again to go to see the KAAOS once more, but behold there was no castle, a mere plain of brown tall grass. In amazement he stared, looking around for the gigantic castle. Confused about tonights events he took a small blanket from his pouch his horse held, spread it over the group beneath him, and fell asleep. He woke up to a beautiful voice calling his name, a woman. "Hi my name Gwena, are you ok M'lord?", Sinath reorted "What is a small whore as yourself, doing way out in the wilderness? scoot back to your life of begging, and selling yourself, begone NOW before I paint these tree's red with your blood!" With that the girl ran off frightened, as Sinath stood up 3 small druids surrounded him, and before he could unsheath his sword. The druids quickly grabbed and one said, "There is no love in being hated by all." Sinath grinned, "Little man I am loved by none, but feared by all, if you do not tell your piss ants to let me go I will slay you all." with that the druid sighed, and unleashed a force of nature upon Sinath, As the dwarfs moved out the way Sinath quickly grabbed his sword, but he noticed something the coin was imbedded in the handle of the sword, and it glowed profusely, "The dwarfs gasped, "You hold the coin of Azmodion!", he replied "What is that? and what does it do?" the dwarfs not filled with fear. It is said the coin can steal souls, and the weapon it combines with... holds in it the souls forever. Sinath struck down the leader with one blow across the back of the neck, and his head hit the dirt path with a small -THUD- the sword now glowed from red to black, and Sinath could feel the dwarfs soul being bestowed into his great sword. As for the other two the chanted a quick few words and were gone into the thick forest. As Sinath still being confused about last nights event and this "Gold Coin" his world plunged into darkness.........
