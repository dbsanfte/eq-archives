I just so happen to be American and I think G. W. Bush Jr. is doing a good job. It takes time to take over a whole country when no one wants to see our brothers and sisters come home in a body bag. Look how long it took to get some support to help USA and Britain out. The USA did not need to ask other nations to further increase the war between Iraq and USA; but they did it anyways. And yes it is still a war from 1991 to our present day.

These few airplane bombs that hit us would only be apart of the war and the main reason G. W. Bush Sr. should of taken out the whole mess of Tyrants that are still in Iraq. But it was a time to prepare for the urban assault and to get some good satellite technology. Those oil fields sure do make a smokescreen as we saw a few years ago in Desert Storm. The main mission was to protect the people in the south and now the United States and Allies will have to finish the whole country off of else we would be letting a tyrant think we are weak. Ever see the snake flag we got over here?

You still think it is about oil? We can burn tires for oil and we got two other kinds of fuel for cars to burn. In 16 years your kids will be driving a new kind of car.

Canada would have to be on the sidelines, haven’t had help from them since WWII.
