<P>
Sitting upon a large grey stone, an old man looked down at the mass of
children, who has gathered around him, who had come to hear one of his tales.
A long, knotted grey beard hung down passed the wrinkled skin of his throat,
the only hair that could be seen on his head. The old man's eyes could barely be
seen behind the thick lenses of his glasses, glasses which lay in the shadows
cast by the wide brimmed hat he was wearing. 
</P>
<P>
With the slowest and most subtle of movements, the old man's frail hands
opened the cover of a weathered tome. The children murmured amongst
themselves, but one glance from the old man silenced them. As the old man
began to tell his story, a story of woe and sorrow, of pain and anguish, the sky
above them began to cloud over with dark clouds and the ominous sound of
thunder could be heard off in the distance. 
</P>
<P>
With a storm brewing around them, the old man continued his tale, and the
children listened with rapt attention, and more than a couple of them bit their
lips as shivers were sent through their bodies from the old man's words.
Nodding to himself before continuing, the old man recounted the scariest
story he could think of while beads of sweat began to appear on his leathery
brow. For, this story brought fear to all, the old, the young, the strong, the
weak. 
</P>
<P>
All feared the horrid tales of KAAOS. 
</P>
<P>
The old man paused in mid verse, leaving the children to their own thoughts as
he remembered the tales he, himself, had heard when he was a child. Many
thought that these stories were just used to put a scare in children, but the
old man knew better. His fingers unconsciously let go of the tome he had held
in his hands and they moved to his cheek, tracing a long purple scar which had
been concealed in shadow. 
</P>
<P>
As his fingers touched the scar, he heard his father's words echoing in his head
and in front of him, he no longer saw the massed children, but instead he saw
himself sitting before his father as his father recounted this same tale. He
listened now as if he had never heard this story before. 
</P>
<P>
The old man listened to his father telling of how the forces which he called
KAAOS had once existed in some far off realm. KAAOS, as they called
themselves, was a band of the most twisted and warped that any had ever come
in contact with, their power being so strong that they were seen as gods and
worshipped as them, as well, his father explained to him in the flashback. When
they had broken the spirit of those who had lived in that far off realm, KAAOS
and a lesser faction began to struggle for control. 
</P>
<P>
The one faction wished to move on, to continue the way of bloodshed and
domination against new peoples instead of staying among the spineless. The
other faction wished to stay in the same realm where the people lay cowering
already. The forces of KAAOS, having made their decision, left the realm of
the weak and moved on to new lands where a challenge existed. The leader, one
named Malhavok, had brought the most evil and most vile lot with him, leaving
the other faction and its weaker members to go their own way. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, KAAOS was born anew, as the movement ended up in the elders cleaning
house and weeding out of the weaker members who didnt have the heart. The
other faction, chuckled the father as he spoke to his son, became a ragtag band
of the slow of wit and weak of soul, who some have heard of as The Mercs. They
always strived their hardest to be like their rival guild KAAOS, but they
lacked the strength or the wit to survive such a task, and thus they sank into
near anonimity. 
</P>
<P>
His father continued to tell the story, his smile gone from his lips now. While
the mercs were always stuck in their own private cesspool of mediocrity, KAAOS
flourished. Whereever they went, rivers of blood flowed under their feet.
Those who stood before them were crushed and broken, there souls damned to
eternal torment at the hands of these Gods of KAAOS. 
</P>
<P>
Then that fateful day came, when the realm that they had conquered was
thrown so far into anarchy and chaos, that all of the people were either slain
or forced to flee. Thus, that realm ceased to exist and KAAOS was forced to
find a new home. A tear began to fall from the corner of the father's eye as he
talked to his son. 
</P>
<P>
"My son," he said, "KAAOS has come here. None of these lands are safe. Even
Lord British and his followers are no match for them. We now enter into a dark
time.. a time of pain. A time of fear. A time of death." 
</P>
<P>
The old man was suddenly awoken from his flashback as a child shook his hand
violently. The old man tried to speak, tried to form a reply, but all he could do
was gasp for breath and clutch his chest. As he fought against the clawing
hand of death, his body began to shake in fear as visions of these dark clad
Gods of KAAOS shot through his head. 
</P>
<P>
Then abruptly, he fell backwards, sprawled on his back ontop of the rock
which he had once sat upon. The book fell to the ground with a dull thud and at
that instant lightning flashed across the sky and the storm came. Rain and hail
began to pummel the earth, causing the children to flee back to their homes, but
no child would ever be the same. No child could ever be the same after listening
to the story of the old man and after seeing the utter look of terror and
anguish that was written upon his face as his life and soul were taken from his
body. 
</P>
<P>
Even as the children were running from the storm's destructive power, a new
sound could be heard by those who listened. Amidst the thunder and confusion,
a low, amused laughter could be heard.. and everyone who heard it knew where
it was coming from. 
</P>
<P>
As fear swept through the people, the Gods of KAAOS laughed. 
</P>
<P>
KAAOS had finally arrived.
