LOL, this guy is hilarious. How do you KAAOSers attract these guys? I don't know if it's more impressive that this guy can type without being able to read, or that he found this site.

Geo, just in case you do actually have some rudimentary reading skills, I'll go over it again. KAAOS knows what they're doing and do not even find it interesting that a newbie like you comes here predicting doom for KAAOS. They also have learned nothing from you. They've known for years that the might have to adapt to Shadowbane, just like they've adapted to every other game. Just like Sin/CC/ect have adapted to Shadowbane beta. Just like Sin/CC/ect will adapt to Shadowbane release. 

They'll avoid adapting as much as they can, but they do assume some amount of adapting. One thing that I can guarantee is that a pile of newbies will still get shredded and destroyed, no matter how big the pile is, and that includes their city. It's amazing how easy it is to turn people who don't trust each other against each other. That is the reason why the newbies always lose and always will lose, no game mechanic can stop that.

You would be a newbie. Enjoy dieing. But remember, your death is only a minor enjoyment. Watching your allies and your town decay around you is the real fun, if you can even get that far.
