         Ahh, I wasnt really planning on coming back to check on this conversation but seeing as it has carried on so far...<P>Im a gamer. I play for keeps. This includes but not limited to MMORPGS. Knowing what that is I begin to see why you have all gathered as a guild. It seems the only way you can derive pleasure from playing is by being on top and winning constantly. This is really just a personal player choice. Personally, I get my kicks out of "living on the edge" in games. I cant tell you how many times I ran head long into a dozen members of a warring guild in UO in hopes of luring one out to pk. This is how I get "satisfaction", escaping near misses and taking the tough kills.<P>In UO it was all about numbers, preparations, connection and organization. In EQ its about lvls and numbers. Considerably more simple than UO was IMHO but still requiring a measure of skill nonetheless. In Shadowbane we dont really know what will matter most, we can assume but not know. My point is that the tactics you used in other games will obviously not apply to SB. <P>Which bring me to my next point... Since when did the MMORPG God deem you guys the facilitators of "the guilds that matter"? You have never fought TCE. You have never grouped with TCE. You have never warred TCE. You have never even so much as taken part with us in a raid (not that there has been any from us on SZ yet.) Who are you to say who matters? You say we are nothing. We say we are a guild to be reckoned with. Whos opinion matters more? Neither. There has been NO (none, nadda, zilch, zinc, zippo) confrontations in which to prove eithers point. So come off your high horse and face that fact that we are no longer vapor. We are guiled, just as you are, on a PvP server. We are no more vapor than you in any way shape or form. We are no more or less important than you in any way shape or form.<P>In conclusion, get over yourselves.<P>-Rek<P>Wanna call me a newb? Come prove it. Words count for nothing.<BR>
