arrived in NeverWinter in his late twenties. Headstrong and arrogant, he
stalked the countryside, with the sole purpose of making a name for himself.
He found NeverWinter a seething pool of chaos, and evil. Yet goodness and
honor were prevalent for a time. In these things he remained True Neutral,
allying himself with those he deemed worthy to be his equal. He struggled
for a time, gaining acceptance as a free-lance assassin but soon started
to accomplish his goal; the name Malhavok invoked either fear, respect
or hatred, in those he opposed. He became a street-fighter in Port Llast,
he became known to many as &quot;Evil One&quot; as he stalked the NeverWinter
Woods and the Lost Hills. Yet through his victories and travels, he lacked
a purpose. The blood of hundreds on his battle hardened hands garnered
him little except prowess. Then suddenly, at the height of his notoriety
and power, Malhavok withdrew from the affairs of the folk of NeverWinter,
retiring deep within his Tower. For one year he stayed in his tower. Speculation
ran wild; was he dead? Did he lose control of a necromantic experiment?
Was he traveling the outer planes?</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#C0C0C0"><FONT SIZE=+1>The truth was, Malhavok took to
subversion. He spied on all the Guilds, and their members. He knew almost
everything about the principal inhabitants of NeverWinter. He gathered
his information for his forthcoming purpose. Formation of a Guild the likes
of which the Forgotten Realms had never seen. A Guild whose members came
and went as they pleased, seeking their own personal plans of conquest,
all for the glory of the Guild. He spied, and learned. Watched and waited.
Until finally the day came when he emerged from his tower. He purchased
the largest Citadel (later being known as the Hell Hole) in NeverWinter
with which to house his Guild. There was only one true way of testing one's
power in the realms, and that was through PVP. His mind made up, he would
form the greatest fighting force the lands had ever known. With this plan
in mind, he once gain he withdrew from the daily life of NeverWinter and
recruited the core members of KAAOS. &nbsp;Over the years, KAAOS' many<A HREF="trophy.htm">
accomplishments</A> speak for themselves.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#C0C0C0"><FONT SIZE=+1>Today, Malhavok approaches fifty
as the gray flecks of white are scattering liberally through his black
beard. He stands 6'2, hairless, and dressed in black and cyan battle armor,
with a tunic of white dotting the front. One may mistake him for a duke
or baron, as the noble sculpting of his chin dictates but their-in lies
the deception. Underneath the sophisticated appearance, lurks the mind
of a Neutral Evil man, whose talent lies in deception, power and undying
loyalty to his creation; KAAOS. It has become the premiere fighting force
in Neverwinter under his careful guidance. KAAOS&nbsp;is the guild to beat
in nearly every PVP&nbsp;and Quest event in Neverwinter. He wields no weapon
in battle, preferring to thrust his hands forward and unleash arcane energies
or bash a skull with his bare fists and natural 18 strength. He worships
no God, and professes to be a God himself. He likes taunting his opponents
into being careless in battle and then unleashing devastating magic's on
the fools. His reputation from old, helps immensely in this task. Lately,
he has taken to wearing black boots. The right one has large silver spikes
covering it and is usually covered with the blood of those he deemed unfit
to become or remain KAAOS&nbsp;Gods. ;)</FONT></FONT></P>

was the time when the old Gods walked the land and goodness consumed the
world that provided the backdrop for the birth of Azimer, the prophesized
God of the Kill. It was then that Hoar, the God of revenge and retribution,
walked the land causing mayhem and madness wherever he went. As was foretold
by whispers on the newly forming wind of the world, Hoar happened upon
the teenage daughter of the king and ancestor of lord Nasher, whose arrogance
and self-centeredness was legendary even at her early age. She glanced
at the god and immediately insulted him as she would a commoner. Hoar's
rage was instant as he grabbed her by the hair and drug her back to the
labyrinth he called home. His methods of retribution were direct and savage,
peeling the skin from her milky white face and burning the rest of her
body beyond recognition. His magicks ensured that she could never sleep
or die, and in her ear she heard over and over again the insult she had
imparted to him, a constant reminder of the price of insulting a god. Though
her body would be considered hideous and disfigured by most, Hoar reveled
in his work and would rape her fiercely two or three times a day.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#C0C0C0"><FONT SIZE=+1>At first he was content with the
blood she oozed after a good cock fucking, but quickly became bored, finding
new ways to cause pain to this &quot;insulting cunt&quot; as he called
her. His experimentation with pincers, insects, and vermin did not curb
his appetite either, only when he discovered barbed-wire did he truly become
intrigued. He would wrap the wire tightly around a long wooden shaft that
he would fuck her with. Jamming it up through her ass till it emerged from
the mouth, he would mercilessly slam it back and forth like a giant saw-toothed
dildo, eating the pieces of flesh as they were shredded from inside her
small lithe body. Held like a pig on a spit, her fuckings were long and
bloody to amuse the god.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#C0C0C0"><FONT SIZE=+1>After a few months, he grew tired
of her and gave her to the great mastiff he kept. She drug the woman back
to her den, but instead of killing and eating her, the bitch sensed the
woman was with child, even as she was pregnant. The kindred spirit saved
the woman who was fed and allowed to live and grow the unborn child inside
her. The day came that the child god was ready to leave the womb and claim
his birthright as a god of the realms. I pushed up through the flesh barrier,
ripping her abdomen open and crawled away from the dying body. Immediately,
the bitch set upon the bloodied body of my mother whom I barely even glanced
at. There were four mastiff puppies in front of me that I instantly recognized
as rivals. I set upon them and with tiny fingers wrapped about their neck
did strangle the first 3 of the puppies. The last and largest looked at
me and a bond was instantly formed. In a glance, all was understood, that
this hound would be my companion throughout my life and I would be his
master.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#C0C0C0"><FONT SIZE=+1>Suckling at the bitch sustained
me as my strength and powers grew. I read all of my hated father's grimoires,
even those that he was afraid to peruse himself because his mind lacked
the depth to comprehend them. Pulling my fathers obsidian flail from the
wall, I waited for him to return from his daily entertainment. As he returned,
covered in human blood, I swung the flail hard, catching him by surprise,
and imbedding the spikes deep in his face. As the blood spurted from his
eyes and ears, I began a barrage of eldrich magic that began to tear his
flesh and sinew from his bones. I wrenched the flail free from his swollen
and bloody head and swung again, piercing the back of his skull. He tried
to counter attack, but his spells bounced harmlessly off the protective
magic I had conjured. Colder than ice and more efficient than a butcher,
I reached down his throat, grasped his heart in my fist, and wrenched it
from his body. As he died in front of me, his heart in my hand, I spoke
my only words to him. &quot;REJOICE FATHER, FOR YOU HAVE BEEN BLESSED NOT
ONCE, BUT TWICE BEYOND THE DREAMS OF ANY BEING THAT HAS EVER EXISTED. YOU
HAVE SIRED A TRUE GOD, AND YOU ARE THE FIRST GOD TO DIE AT MY HANDS. REJOICE,
FOR YOUR PLACE IN HISTORY IS SECURE EVEN AS THE LIFE ESSENCE FLOWS FROM
YOUR BODY AND I CLAIM YOUR SOUL FOREVER!&quot; His body collapsed and I
hungrily devoured his still beating heart, savoring the taste and feel
of the kill.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#C0C0C0"><FONT SIZE=+1>Time passes and I spend most all
my time hunting down the old false gods of the realms and killing them.
Tyr, Midnight, Torm, Bane, Myrkul, and Helm are just a few of the gods
that fell to the obsidian flail and magics of the God of the Kill. My every
thought and fiber of my being became consumed and focused on the art of
the kill. After eons of perfecting my craft and eliminating all the elder
gods, I discovered that there are other new gods that have existed even
longer than myself. They had named themselves the Gods of KAAOS, and I
immediately endeavored to join their ranks. The gods were kindred spirits
who reveled in the sheer nakedness of evil, scoffing at the pretenders
and the wannabes, and drinking deep of the nectar of vileness that drives
the world. I had found home.</FONT></FONT>

in the cold, dark chamber, at the center of awareness that enveloped the
Fortress that joined with and unsettled the magic, he lay. His blood had
been spreading in a large pool for many hours and was beginning to cake
into the many grooves between the stones of the floor. The gaping hole
in this chest, where the bones stuck sharply out at all angles, had long
since stopped sucking at the air. His eyes were open, but he did not see.
He did not blink, or breathe, did not smell, or hear. His hair was long
and white, his beard the same color and his skin was mottled, wrinkled
and pale. Rot had appeared in several places especially around the ragged
chest wound. Ego Prime, the last of a line of powerful sorcerers, a sect
within the Roman Catholic church, on his last breathe had opened the doors
to hell from which emerged the true shadows, demon things born of brimstone
and death.</FONT></FONT></DD>

<P><FONT COLOR="#C0C0C0"><FONT SIZE=+1>The Gods of KAAOS roamed the many
dark corridors of the Hell Hole above. Soul spritzers, the hot tub, the
screams ot tortured souls, the bone thrown becoming another worshiper,
Sol slaves pampering their Gods, Doc Krypto's lab, the Evil within these
confines reached out to me like an ITB chasing a save. Thum-tum A trill
went out into the awareness and all above felt it, through yards of stone,
like a pre-orgasmic shiver. Thum-tum, Thum-tum The newly formed heart rattled
along like a freight train. Speeding out of control to do a job it was
never meant for. It screamed at the trauma of the pain, but kept drumming
as a thin film of muscle spread across the open wound. Around the body,
blood that had dried, scabbing the stone floor was wet again, warm again.
And just as it had slowly seeped from him, pooling on the floor so now
it was absorbed by his skin, through his pores, flowing back into his body,
like the tide rolling in. With the evil coursing through my veins and the
mystical powers returned, I was drawn to the portal of the God's lair and
there I materialized only to scare a Sol slave. A sword entered through
my back and out my stomach, and I vomited blood, hunching over. The Gods
stood there silently and watched. I turned fast, my movement pulling the
sword from the attackers grasp, then reached around him to pull the blade
from my body. “That......fucking......hurt!” I said, swinging the blade
down into the shoulder of my attacker, a female Sol. The sword sank deep
into her body, cracking the collarbone and splintering the ribs. I turned
and faced the others as my wounds healed. A smile spread across their collective
faces and I knew I was home.</FONT></FONT></P>

the crack of thunder the sky turned black. Somewhere in the distance the
sound of a chambermaid shouting, &quot;ITS COMING&quot; could be heard
between the shrill screams of a delivering mother. The dark clouds swirled
violently above the &quot;birth&quot; house as the unwilling child was
being expelled.</FONT></FONT></P>

her mind, she knew, she was a virgin</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#C0C0C0"><FONT SIZE=+1>With low, animalistic grunts the
peasant girl pushed with all her might, she wanted it OUT, out of her womb.
As the chambermaid shouted PUSH! PUSH! the peasant girl gritted her teeth
as her stomach muscles tightly flexed. The chambermaid's eyes opened wide.
&quot;I CAN SEE IT!&quot; she yelped excitedly. Suddenly the chambermaid's
look became the look of horror. She was sprayed with blood and mucus as
one black hoof poked out from between the virgin mothers slender legs.
The maid's stomach twisted into a tight knot spraying vomit all over the
screeching mother. And somewhere, inside the womb, the childs lips twisted
into it's first smile. The child, at first unwilling, wanted out of this
whore....NOW. The one razor sharp hoof kicked out violently tearing open
a gaping wound from clit to belly button. A red gush of fluid, blood and
chamber-maid vomit spilled onto the floor in a muticolored mess. The embryonic
fluid was a thick black, tarry stuff teeming with small white worms. The
child slid slowly out and plopped solidly onto the floor. The worms, knowing
their job, quickly enveloped the child in a living sheath, protecting it
from the light.</FONT></FONT></P>

du Mortere stood at the edge of the cliff. Gulls screeched overhead and
dove into the blue waters in search of food. He was dressed in his white
ether-armor, as his rank of Patriarch Demi-Demon accorded. Yet, he did
not look like a demon. From all outward appearance he was a man, a very
pale man, but still, he appeared to be human. He spoke like a man, he ate
like a man, he even slept like a man. He was a man... to a point. He was
one of the fortunate of the Abyss. He had no physical oddities, such as
wings or horns, which many of his brethren possessed. Most of his demon
characteristics were simply on areas hidden by clothing. His conception
was a strange one. A female demon raping a human male was uncommon to say
the least. Normally, it were the males who lusted for human women. This
was most likely the reason only part of his stomach and half of his left
leg were covered with a thick, scaly black hide. He had even been able
to bed several human woman, in darkly lit whore houses, with no notice
of his demon qualities. He carrys a black and white +2 Mirrored Shield.
His weapon, FleshFlayer, is a totally black, obsidian flail made of magical
steel and spiked with short black barbs. He whirls his flail over his head
and releases his devastating magics through it.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#C0C0C0"><FONT SIZE=+1>The wind whipped his black cloak
and he pulled it tight about him. The chilly evening air cut through him
as the white foam of the ocean beat against the rocks of the shore below.
&quot;The upper world is much too cold for my liking&quot; he spoke aloud
as he shivered in the early fall air. Slayve hated the cold, but he did
not hate these KAAOS Gods who summoned him from the Abyss, as he had in
the days soon after his summons. He had loathed the upper world and all
who dwelled in it. But soon, after partaking of the bloody offerings, unholy
sex and depraived rituals of KAAOS, he began to like this strange, new
world. He soon found he had a talent for human and elven magic, and his
inhuman ego drove him to compete against these mortal fools in Neverwinter.
He quickly gained prowess by beating down any who stood in his way. He
soon became the most feared, and most decorated warrior in the entire Forgotten
Realms. And, as unlikely as it seemed, he owed it all to this gang of murderers
called KAAOS.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#C0C0C0"><FONT SIZE=+1>A gull whirled overhead. Slayve
looked up to see it had it's dinner of fish lodged in it's beak as it flew
through the crisp fall, evening air. He blinked and the air around the
gull dove up and rammed the creature to the ground. It's body splattered
as it hit the hard surface of the cliff. Slayve du Mortere glared down
at the broken creature and marveled at it.</FONT></FONT></P>

horizon, drinking in it's beauty one last time. He gathered the evening
breeze and flew southward, back toward the Hell Hole.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#C0C0C0"><FONT SIZE=+1>Mother had been a Vampire; omnipotent
beings rarely recover from domination, and Mother never forgot the molestation
of her mind and soul. Time had warped her recollection of it, turning it
into a lofty victory instead of her greatest defeat, but the truth was
buried between the lines. Herein lies my heritage. Raised among the criminally
insane sect, ostracised to become the leader of the factious sect; at an
early age I grew bored with what both mortals and immortals deemed 'reality'.
-- My greatest joys were attained when one or many were left to wonder
exactly what had led them to BELIEVE in such a thing as REALITY, grasping
desperately to their mental state, like so many rungs of a falling ladder.
-- Of my Mother's realm there were few one could call true opponents, (After
all, what was there to make life worth experiencing besides strife and
conflict?) and their arguments grew weak and stale over time. Even among
those living the tales of their childhood, who actually believed themselves
to be 'the monsters', 'incarnations of dark metaphors and suppressed desires',
'baseless superstitions, artistic genre', 'psychological conditions,' 'yearnings
made flesh', and 'externalisation of a guilt-lust-violence complex', yes,
even among those who chanted so unjustifiably of their immortal ... POWER!
... in their tutored, sardonically arrogant voices ... even here I grew
wearied of it all: I truly was my father's daughter. Shortly after attaining
what, in the Vampire realm, is reverently named Golconda, and perhaps more
closely described as 'Nirvana' by mortals, I gave up hope that my &quot;peers&quot;
would ever leave their quagmires of intellectual infancy; they happily
created their own problems, and grappled in mental anguish over the solutions.
I left them to their slothing existence, and it was KAAOS that found me.
Killing As An Organized Sport. That is how it was summarised to me. A simple
description of a complex art, I was later to learn, for in truth I saw
it as nothing more than mortals playing at Godhood in the beginning. How
could they know of the immense solitude? The colossal amount of will-power
involved with mortal association? The tremendous effort encompassed to
find amusement among inferiority? How could they know indeed. These thoughts
of old bring me amusement. Yes, they knew well of what they had, themselves,
given birth to: Longing for acceptance, desperate clutching for unshakeable
belief, pained and tortured visages of those who have just learned they
are among evil unarmed, KAAOS is the reason behind every mortal/immortal
complication. And like a family's favourite child, they nurtured their
creations, expounding and jabbing it to grow. And grow it does. Here I
make my home. Here I am one of many. Here they understand the phrase whispered
to Mother during the brief violation that beget my existence:</FONT></FONT></P>

and sisters of the Bond had sheltered him, taught him, and trained him,
his loyalty had never faltered. Mirage was in the Bond and the Bond with
in Mirage. Shaking his head slowly, visions began to return to him.. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#C0C0C0"><FONT SIZE=+1>...Merculus spoke a quick phrase,
spitting out the final syllables of his spell. The grey skinned figure
dove aside as the lightning bolt sizzled past his falling body. Mirage
rolled back to his feet, speaking the arcane words of protection his brothers
had taught him. Taking the great hammer from his belt, he spun towards
his attacker.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#C0C0C0"><FONT SIZE=+1>Merculus laughed dryly at the figure
before him. Knowing that this boy was no match for his powers, he sat back
and watched. He fingered the weapon in his hands, an almost nonchalant
look on his face as his eyes met with the boy who's soul he was about to
take.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#C0C0C0"><FONT SIZE=+1>Speaking slowly, muttering words
of power, Mirage drew closer to his attacker, his ignorance shielding from
the fear he should be feeling. As he prepared to launch his first offensive,
a searing pain ripped through his being, shattering his protective spells,
leaving him stunned. Glancing upwards, Mirage saw nothing in front of him,
nothing except the shimmering of some sort of magic. Falling to his knees,
he fought to turn around, to protect himself from the killing blow that
was sure to follow.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#C0C0C0"><FONT SIZE=+1>Laughing openly now, Merculus grinned
from ear to ear as he watched the scarlet lifeblood of the boy in front
of him run down his back. A hint of white, the white of bone, between the
torn flesh, proved the strength of the KAAOS God. Raising his weapon with
ease, he prepared to claim the soul at his hands, in the name of KAAOS.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#C0C0C0"><FONT SIZE=+1>As Merculus brought his flail high
over his head, the twang of a bow, the twang of many bows, halted his killing
stroke. Turning he watched a flight of a dozen arrows cascade through the
air towards his wide open body. He looked back to his prey, then back to
the arrows and sighed. He spoke again, his magic surrounding him, shielding
him as arrow after arrow shattered against the invisible barrier.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#C0C0C0"><FONT SIZE=+1>Growling, Merculus kicked the kneeling
form in front of him and spun back to his new threat. Growling again, streams
of flame streamed from his fingertips and bolts of pure energy lanced towards
his hunters. Knowing that he would be hard-pressed after expending much
of his strength, he let with loose all of his power.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#C0C0C0"><FONT SIZE=+1>Mirage slumped down momentarily,
then began struggling to his feet as screams of agony cut through his ear
drums. Standing shakily, he saw his attacker massacring six tall figures.
The lone figure was taking on six men, and he was only at half strength!
Mirage stood in awe of his power, captive to his might, entranced by his
strength. Then he saw the two hidden figures moving through the shadows,
swords in hand, nearing his attacker. He knew he should flee, that he would
quickly be dispatched in his weakened form, but he also realized he should
be dead. Very dead. Looking back towards Merculus, envy of his power in
his eyes, Mirage attacked.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#C0C0C0"><FONT SIZE=+1>Merculus wearily laughed at the
charred and broken bodies laying in front of him, thinking to himself..
&quot;Shit. Only seven souls? I must be tired.&quot; Hearing a scream come
from almost right on top of him, he dove headlong out of the way. A blade
slashed right where his head would have been, but cut only air.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#C0C0C0"><FONT SIZE=+1>Laying on his hands and knees, nearly
exhausted, Merculus watched his prey move towards these two men. His eyes
met Mirage's momentarily and this time, Merculus could not take his eyes
off of this boy. He saw such hatred in those eyes, such contempt, such
blood-thirst, and.. such Envy. He knew right away that this boy wanted
power. Finally breaking free of his daze, Merculus realized that the fight
had ended. The boy in stood in front of him, blood spattered all of his
face. A puddle of crimson began to gather around his feet from the gaping
wound on his back and his knees looked as if they would buckle any moment.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#C0C0C0"><FONT SIZE=+1>Mirage said nothing as he fell.
Then all went dark around him. When he awoke, he was weak, but healed and
the KAAOS God, Merculus was no where to be seen. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#C0C0C0"><FONT SIZE=+1>He woke from his dreamlike trance
and shook his head. The Bond had claimed how powerful they were, yet with
all of his training, Mirage was no match for this God. All he could think
about was how much he wanted that power. And with those thoughts, his loyalty
to House ITB began to fade. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#C0C0C0"><FONT SIZE=+1>As the months passed, Mirage began
to grow distant from those he had called family. He began to train on his
own, staying away from the place he used to call home. Somehow he always
knew where to find those he sought. He always knew where to find KAAOS
and he met with them willingly.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#C0C0C0"><FONT SIZE=+1>This continued for weeks, until
his family began to grow suspicious of him. Mirage knew that the time had
come. House ITB had offered him a place to stay, a place to learn, but
they could only teach so much. They had not even come close to rivaling
the power of those of KAAOS he had met. Mirage knew that his quest for
power would always end in the same spot. The KAAOS Hell Hole.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#C0C0C0"><FONT SIZE=+1>Taking a dagger from belt, he brought
the blade to his forearm. Staring directly at the mark of House ITB upon
him, he ground the length of the blade into his skin, and snarled as the
blade bit into his flesh. Moving the dagger back and forth, blood streaming
down his arm and between his fingers, he systematically flayed the marked
skin from his arm. Tossing the dagger aside and wrapping a bandage around
his forearm, Mirage left his home behind. Left his family behind.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#C0C0C0"><FONT SIZE=+1>Left the Bond behind. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#C0C0C0"><FONT SIZE=+1>His power grew quickly over the
next few weeks, and he was &quot;welcomed&quot; into the KAAOS Hell Hole.
Taking on the prefix &quot;Kal&quot; -meaning King and God in high common-,
Mirage found out the truth. The truth that his old family had hid from
him. The truth that House ITB was weak and that they could never match
nor rival the power of KAAOS. Everything they had told him had been bullshit
and he felt no remorse about his betrayal. &quot;Let them rot in their
cesspool of stagnation and under-achievement,&quot; he thought. Shrugging,
he strode away, in search of blood. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</FONT></FONT></P>

</FONT></FONT></I></B><FONT COLOR="#C0C0C0"><FONT SIZE=+1>Nurgling is the
Great Lord of Decay who presides over physical corruption, and morbidity.
Disease, and putrefaction attract his demons like flies to a rotted corpse.
For his amusement he devises foul, and diverse contagions that he inflicts
upon the mortals of Neverwinter. Many of the most horrible diseases are
Nurgling's proudest creations. Mortals who perish in their grip are claimed
by the Plague Lord so that their souls are caught in the eternally bubbling
foulness of his realm. It is said that the fate of those who die of the
foul disease Nurgling's Rot is to serve the Lord of Decay forever in the
most disgusting form of a demon called a Plaguebearer. Huge black flies
lay their filthy eggs on these foul demons, and clumps of maggots crawl,
and clamber over their putrid hides, feeding upon the putrescent matter
that drips from their oozing sores. When the flies hatch, they swarm around
the Plaguebearer in a buzzing cloud of vileness, and will turn upon, and
attack its enemies.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#C0C0C0"><FONT SIZE=+1>The Plaguebearer's body is swollen
with contagion, and churning innards spill from tears in their rancid skin.
It has a single baleful eye, and from its head sprouts a long horn. In
its clawed hand the demon carries a sword with a distorted barbed edge.
This is the Plagesword of Nurgling whose touch brings disease, and death
to mortal creatures.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#C0C0C0"><FONT SIZE=+1>The gods immense body is bloated
with corruption, and exudes a sickly, diseased stench. His skin is greenish,
leathery, and necrotic, its surface pock-marked with running sores, swelling
boils, and infestations. His inner organs, rank with excremental decay,
spill through the ruptured skin to hang like bunches of scrofulous grapes
around his girth. From these organs burst tiny demons which chew, and suck
upon the nauseous jucies within. This then is the appearance of the KAAOS
god Nurgling, though mere words cannot do justice to his truly monumental
foulness....</FONT></FONT>
