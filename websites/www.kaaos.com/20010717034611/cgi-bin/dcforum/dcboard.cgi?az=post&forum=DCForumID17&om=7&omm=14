         <blockquote>
         Darkenbane is not indictive of most people.   They are losers who managed to set themselves up to win more often than not.   They have become accustomed to an undeserved w/l ratio.  <P>I had a roommate that loved Star Wars.   So he bought Jedi Knight and convinced me to play it.   I'm not big on FPS but I payed.  He sucked.  The matches went to 10 frags.  He usually had 2. I felt so bad I would let him get a few undeserved kills sometimes.  We played for a few hours.   Finally when we stopped it was becuase I was sick of the game.  He, on the other hand had gotten up to 4 or 5 frags per game.    He was all excited, because compared to himself he was doing really well.  But in absolute terms 10 to 5 is still getting owned.<P>When I was playing UO on baja with a different roommate we were PKing in the same room on computers right next to each other with cable modems.  With .17 ms pings, a great character and an almost too well coordianted team it wasnt even a challenge.  As stat-loss murderers my only death in 500 kills was when my computer crashed.  My roomie died once when he charged 6 antis with no mana.<P>We quit after only a few weeks because it was too easy.  It just wasnt fun winning all the time.   <P>I'm accustomed to about 1 death in 20 fights.   Transition to EQ where combat is much less about skill caused it to go to about 1 in 10.  No problem.   Go to a game where like blackjack where it's mostly chance and I win 50/50.  It's just not fun at all.   Yet there are thousands of people who love blackjack.   Even solitaire I think has only a 20% chance to win any given hand.  There are 4 people in my office playing it right now.   Just like the game against AI where you win 99%   it's fucking BORING.<P>I guess the long-gotten to point is that it's not so much about winning.  It's about having wins be in line with what you expect.<P>There are many EQ gimps on bluebie servers who never get past 20th level because they keep dying to mobs.   They keep playing.  They arent necessarily even the ones who bitch.<P>The bitching comes from a need to not be at fault, an unwillingness to just accept that bad things happen and a desire to just blow off steam.   <P>The perfect example is when playing SG someone playing artillery will be under attack from aircraft.  They say "AA(anti air) plz help" "AA protect the artillery!"  "You assholes, help"  "You fuckers dont protect the artillery" I look around and see no allied players with AA.<P>It's the same "bitch about how it's someone's fault even when it isnt" mindset that has caused so much damage to otherwise good games.<P>In UO hiding while in combat was fairly powerful, but it should be, it required a whole skill to be good at it.   Lots of people would get caught unprepared and since it was unrealistic (but balanced) it got nerfed.<P>There will be a bunch of people who call for nerfs and cry when they have trouble with something.  "I lost to a wizard, they are too powerful, nerf them."<P>I dont see a direct relationship between this kind a complaining and quitting.   My gf complains about everything.   She's too cold, her feet hurt, she's tied.   I tell her to put on a jacket, sit down or take a nap.   She doesnt want to hear solutions.  She just wants to bitch.<P>The real problem is that the developers cant tell the difference between someone bitching about PKs just because they got killed and are a little riled up about it, and the few who just cant stand being PK'd anymore.  They make the false assumption that it's all the later.<P>They assume that bluebie servers are so much more popular for this very reason.   They are wrong.  The simple solution is that most people will take the path of least resistance.  PvP  is an added resistance.   Given the choice of climbing stairs or taking an elevator 90% will take the elevator.   Would they use the stairs without complaint if there were no elevator?  You bet.<P>Everyone here knows that once maxxed PvP is vital to continued interest.    You can only kill a dragon so many times before it's a bore.  The quick level curves of NWN/DSO made that obvious.  The slow ass one of EQ makes it seem untrue.<P>Devs are stupid.
