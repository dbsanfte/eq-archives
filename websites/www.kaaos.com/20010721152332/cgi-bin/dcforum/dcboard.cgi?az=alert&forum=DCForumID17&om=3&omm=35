I'll save my list of personal NwN allocates because... personally... I don't think they count for much, actually.  However, the list would be rather impressive back in the day. (ask around as to who Dudemyster, ITB Drunk, and/or ITB Faust was).

NwN was a good training grounds for Online Gamers and, at the end of the day, we who played it a great deal all seem to have walked away with a lot of ideas about how a game SHOULD be created.  Sadly, many of our ideas have not been implemented and, I think its important to note that not all former NwN players completely agree with Hedron's opinions completely.  The ideas generated about game design by NwN people tend to be philosophical ideas generated in the Imagination, not actual principles.  I believe this is because NwN was so LIMITING in functionality that people were forced to use their imaginations... which is good... but not panacea.

However... were they to start NwN up again, in all its wonderfulness, I wouldn't play it.  Perhaps its the kind of game which should be ported to the Palm OS and played via BlueTooth... perhaps I'd toy around with that a bit.  Kinda like Advanced Pong or 3d Tetris.  On some levels I wish someone would make a NwN clone to effectively remove the "NwN was Perfect" Lamers and AOL Demographic from the competitive arena.
