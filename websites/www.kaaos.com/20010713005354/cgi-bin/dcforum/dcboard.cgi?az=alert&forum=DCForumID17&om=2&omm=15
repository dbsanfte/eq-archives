"That was a private icq conversation from 5 months ago."

Vosx, it was a headline on your site on Monday.  The jist of the news story (the way I read it) is "I'm hip I was already yammering with Ashen about this stuff months ago"... I tune into your site about 15 times a day and this kinda stuff makes me groan.  Will I keep checking your site?  Yes, once in a while you guys get real news... but I sure as hell am not clicking on your banner ads (if you get my drift).

Am I one of the guys that shoots down Shadowbane at every opportunity?  No.  I've been supporting it.  Maybe not supporting it by flying into a chat room every time a WP employee enters for the express purpose of blowing smoke up their ass, but I've been supporting it.

"why don't you follow a damn game for 24 friggin 7 for over year, praying to get a crumb of useful information so you can justify keeping your job and giving your people something they want."

I've been doing exactly that (you have no idea how I've been doing exactly that).  And not just for Shadowbane...  I can't say I do it to keep a job... I decided long ago that this shit is a HOBBY and here's why...

Kissing ass to developers that screw up so that I can remain the favorite boy is demeaning and does not further the hopes and dreams of hard core online gamers that DESERVE a decent game.  C'mon!  The technology is here, the bandwidth is here, there are surely people who know what a good design would look like... but these guys (MMORPG developers in general, not WolfPack) are catering to the lowest comon denominator of game savvy and playing AOL to the masses.   Sucking their press package information for "news" doesn't challenge the developers to create things that are worthy of our time.  

1. UO is/was full of bugs and half assed spagetti code... some sites ignored it as if things were just hunkie dorie because they wanted Designer Dragons to cuddle with them. Then Garriot gets shafted and the whole Daisy chain of reach-around GM butt buddies collapses in a giant heap... And pets.com had more informative stories about the FAULTS of UO than most of the fan sites, and I'm not just throwing Snowballs here. 

2. EQ's original engine design HAD to be a 6 person LAN based game, their PvP is a complete nightmare, and they spent about 30 second understanding what an "Online Guild" actually does for an online game... I could go on for hours and hours about their foibles...  Result?  Very few sites will make mention of the ugly but REAL facts and spend all their time singing Happy Happy Joy Joy so that Verant will throw them a bone once in a while.  ONLINE WEDDING ON TAREW MARR!!! BE THERE!!  I don't read the mainline EQ fan sites any more... just the specific ones.  Signal to noise ratio again.

Lets get to the real issue... I'm scared as hell of Shadowbane.  Why?  Because it SOUNDS perfect.  I've even talked to Arcane personally on several occasions trying to punch holes in their design... I can't.  It SOUNDS insanely awesome.

However, just like Suzy256 in an AOL Chat Room 99% of the most beautiful thing you've ever seen is created in your imagination.  Is Shadowbane perfect?  Or am I filling in the blanks with my IDEA of perfection?  And just like Suzy256... I wanna see, touch, and fondle things before I believe.  I don't fall in love with things on the Internet.  In other words, I've met Suzy256.... and although Bob would provide a world class case study in wierdness... he isn't exactly what was advertized.  Your telling me that you want to keep promoting Suzy256 because she cybers you in private rooms and you like it... Suzy256 wont cyber you if you tell anyone HOW she cybers you... but you get to come here and tell us that your geting a constant amount of cyber while we're out in the cold.  

And your not soothing my fears.  Your making them worse by telling me you're corporate salute to Wolfpack starts out by getting on your knees.

~f

(Let me spell this one out for the unenlightened... Suzy256 is an analogy for the many game's that sound perfect but end up being not so perfect)
