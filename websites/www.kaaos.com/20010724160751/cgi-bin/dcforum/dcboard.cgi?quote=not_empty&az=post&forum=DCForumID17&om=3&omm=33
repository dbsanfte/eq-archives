         Aside from Snowie, AOL, and the high fees, not a single point you make is valid.<P>No melee PvP? Aw shit, mindless melee types were useless in PvP...who really gives a fuck?<P>The AI in NWN was just fine.  It may have been predictable, but it was a fairly straightforward system where NPCs did the intended thing.  Compare NWN AI to EQ AI...funny how the low end one is the only one that works worth shit?<P>Low end graphics...play single player games for graphics, I'll take superior gameplay any day of the week.<P>You need more than 8 PCs in a fight because?  Nothing is dynamic unless at least 50 people are involved at once?  Or maybe your gimp ass just needs more than 6 friends to prop you up against someone halfway competent.<P>Penalties for death....I knew there was some jackass that enjoyed EQ corpse recovery and xp loss!  Stand up and be counted, the Darwin awards wouldn't be complete without you.<P>No penalties for hacking...suspension/ban of an account wasn't a penalty eh? <P>No point to winning...you won for the sake of proving your skill.  If you want to see other reasons for winning, just check out the Trophy Room, we won a few.<P>No communication...there were ESPs and general chat, not to mention colors, symbols, and a macroing utilities available.  <P>No point to the game...again, go back to single player games.  Those have a distinct end.  Besides, you seem like the play with yourself type.<P>No individuality/difference in PCs...hmm, you could completely customize appearance, text colors, names, surnames, guilds, not to mention develop a char.<P>No NPCs, just a name and a picture...what the fuck?  Do you have no friends?  Do you want NPCs that talk to you, buy you drinks, invite you to parties, perhaps partake in some kinky sex?  You queer freak.<P>DOS...what's wrong with DOS, not enough Gates for ya?  Or did it tax your already overused brain?<P>No updates...NWN had several updates, all of them significant.<P>No balances...who are you, Brad himself?  Balancing is a moronic issue.  Some classes are superior to others, accept it and play them or whine until it's changed.  You're obviously part of the bitching and moaning set.<P>No patches...you've been playing a bit too much UO/EQ.  Not every game is buggy as fuck with a whining playerbase that requires constant patching.<P>No "developer"...I'm glad you enjoy sucking Sony's corporate shaft.<P>Volunteer staff paid with toys...and there were numerous events in which non-staffers could earn pearls as well.  Most of em were pretty fun too.<P>The last 4 I won't disagree without, although there's no internet with EQ either.<P>So, in brief, were you too busy whacking off to play NWN or were you just oblivious to 99% of it?<P>And no, I never had a single complaint about gameplay.  <P>Fat Kid<BR>KAAOS
