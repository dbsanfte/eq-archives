I just checked, you have access to the boards you need access to. You should see 2 private boards in addition to this public board in the Shadowbane section. If you do not see this then I suggest you log out and re-log back in. If you still do not see the proper number of boards e-mail me. Let me know which board/boards you do see and I will try to locate the problem.<P>Azmodion<BR>KAAOS
