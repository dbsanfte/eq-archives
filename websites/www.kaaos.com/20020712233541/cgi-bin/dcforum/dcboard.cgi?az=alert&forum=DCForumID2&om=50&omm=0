5/17:

It’s been a while; my master would have flogged me near to death if he knew I went this long without writing.  I’ve forgotten what I put in this thing; guess starting over would be best.   The name is Carl, 37 years of age, lover of art, music, fine wine and women.   I’ve been working twenty years or so as an assassin for the kingdom of Shuy, they pay well and it’s better then doing petty jobs taking out some barmaid’s husband so she can keep banging the damn bartender’s son.   I still get a few offers for some small jobs, I normally take them, guess old habits die hard.  I’ve seen a sudden rise in the demand for professionals such as myself, could be because after about 200 years of peace the newest leaders of the three kingdoms are getting greedy.  That’s fine with me, their politics are none of my concern, there’s always a place for me under any king in any land.   I’ve gotten six letters today requesting my presence at some bumfuck back ally meetings, no doubt wanting me to smack around some cousin or friend of a big wig, a couple have royal seals; should be interesting.

5/24

First meeting was tonight, but I’m not sure if I want to take it.  I’ve widowed women and broken families, but this task, it leaves a bad taste in my mouth.  Don’t get me wrong, I can do it, but killing a five-year-old child…shit this is a tough one.  The price on this kid’s head is very high; highest I’ve ever seen in a freelance contract, it rivals most of the ones I got from Shuy.  There’s the money and there’s the reputation, if I take out the kid there’s a chance that I’ll be stuck in a rut only getting jobs to do kids, it’s fairly rare to find someone that is willing to deal with this kind of shit.  His name is Jason, son of Lord Mathew of Weil.  From the research I’ve done, I’ve found out that he goes horse riding with his guardian and three bodyguards every four days.   That would be the perfect time to hit him, but he’s only there for a couple hours at a time, so it would have to be fast.   The bodyguards are no threat, just rookies, they change every moon or so.   That guardian is going to be a problem; he really has nothing to live for so bribing is out of the question as is blackmail.  From what I’ve seen while following him he does have a weakness for the drink, which figures seeing that he’s a five-year-old’s bitch day and night.  Still not sure if I should take the job, I think a few drinks would help me out a bit.

5/25

Well, I took the job last night, or at least that’s what I was told.  I have two moons to complete the task or the contract is void and my name gets tagged onto it.   I don’t have much time, I have to travel light and fast, so I’m leaving the journal behind.

6/01

It’s done; the kid is dead.  I was right, getting the guardian drunk was the key to the whole job.  The bodyguards were easy to keep out of the way, used the guardian’s position to keep them busy with rumors of an assassin that wants to kill the boy.  I’m still laughing about that one.  No more kid jobs for me, can’t stand that, too many sick bastards.  I had to kill the guardian and stash his body, wanted to make it look like he killed the kid and bolted.   Okay, okay, I made that last part up, the truth is the guardian wanted to rape the child…. he took a really long time to die.   I’m meeting the clients in about an hour, they chose a public place, and in my line of work a “public place” is always a bad sign.  Just hope they don’t want to try and stiff me.   I think I’ll take a short vacation after I get paid, take a load off, get laid, get drunk, maybe pick a couple of bar fights to release some tension.

8/10

Figures, I get back from a nice long and relaxing trip to...wherever the hell I went, and the shit has hit the fan.   The kingdoms are going to war and I’m out of work with the kingdoms, full out war isn’t the best job environment for someone that deals in stealthy death.  Guess I’m back to the odd jobs; it pays the bills, glad I still keep up with my old contacts.   Well I’m off to find a mark and make some money so I can eat tonight.  Just like the old days.
