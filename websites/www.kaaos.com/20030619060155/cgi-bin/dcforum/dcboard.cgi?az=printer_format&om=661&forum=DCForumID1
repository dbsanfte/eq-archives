You do not need fast twitch if you plan ahead. <BR>Here are a few methods to help you out if you are kind of slow:<P>Many times you could outfit your guy with infintration "armor" and get good results with a pistol or knife.<P> Another method is to be prepaired and stand or crouch facing a door in a room that demands defending such a the command counsel room. You know someone is going to try and destroy this room or hack it. <P>Always aim for the body since this is the main part of a soldier unless you have a splash weapon where you should hit the ground, it can almost be as damaging as a direct hit. <P>Have a few guys to back you up and avoid using the wrong weapons. <P>Having a Jackhammer shotgun and a sniper rifle is my combination with the reinforced battle armor. (holds two rifle guns)<P>Lastly using a heavy tank or vehicle. Does not matter if you are slow with counter-attacks sice you get 2000 to 2500 armor.<P>As far as having a private PS forum, good luck with that since I never use any other forum than Public. <img src="http://www.kaaos.com/htdocs/dcforum/Images/tongue.gif">

Planetside can still be a topic on the public forum. That is why it don't really matter to me. Being able to log on is just a formality.
