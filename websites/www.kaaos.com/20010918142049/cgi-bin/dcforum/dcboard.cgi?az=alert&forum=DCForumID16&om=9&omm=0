From a Lum story about Luclin expansion at:
http://www.lumthemad.net/news/2004.php

Here's the interesting part.

[hr]
Lum: What kind of PvP stuff do you have going in with this? I remember reading that you basically have two factions with this world, have you done any development on that yet? 

Abashi: Uh, the PvP stuff that’s been mentioned with Luclin was actually a misunderstanding. 

Lum: Well, I remember the rumor that the whole thing would be arena-type free PvP zones. But I mean aside from that, are there going to be any PvP enhancements? 

Abashi: Not as part of Luclin. We are doing a new PvP server in the near future. It will probably come out in two to three weeks, maybe a bit longer. I can give you the skinny on that new rule set, it hasn’t been announced yet. 

Lum: Sure. 

Abashi: There’s still a couple of aspects that are a little bit tentative, but this is the general direction that we’re going for. A Deity-teams server. It will be based on your religion. We’ll have good, neutral and evil as the split. Which team they’ll apply to, we’ll release that later. We’re going with full PvP. You can kill anyone at any level. A level 60 could kill a level 1 if he wanted to, or a whole slew of level ones could… 

Lum: What’s going to keep a level 60 warrior from harvesting the newbie spawn? 

Abashi: The question would be, what would be the point? 

Lum: That’s a good question with a lot of things about PvP! 

Abashi: Loot rights will apply still for plus or minus five levels. 

Lum: So you can attack someone, just not loot them. 

Abashi: Right. We’re leaning towards coin-only for that loot for right now. There will be experience loss when dying to someone plus or minus 5 levels. It was the only way we could think of to address the naked mage syndrome. There has to be some way of inflicting loss. 

Lum: Would there be some timer on that, to prevent corpse camping? 

Abashi: No, players will have to learn when that occurs, and learn how to get out of that situation. In the case of the level 60 camping the newbie spawn, sooner or later word will get out and other 60s will come and get him. We will have ways of promoting PvP. I haven’t talked yet about any of the advantages we’re adding, which I’m about to get to. Also, as part of this, by the way, we’re getting rid of all the customer service rules associated with PvP. So training, rules against training, rules against bind point camping, zone camping, all of that will go away. 

Lum: So those become strategies, basically. 

Abashi: Those become strategies. People will engage in them as they see fit. Snaring the kiting druid, which right now could get you suspended or worse, will be a very legal strategy. The only thing that customer service will get involved in is real-world harassment situations. Common decency things. For advantages for PvP. We’re not going to do experience gain. We’ve ruled that out completely. We are talking about what we call an insignia based system. Where when you loot the coin off a fallen foe you will get an insignia of your deity. And we’re talking about turning that in for a faction boost, and once you get past a certain point you get benefits, open up quests that were no longer available to you, that type of thing. The other thing that we’re talking about doing, and actually working on implementing now, is logging all the PvP kills. And then we’re going to parse that log and keep a leader board on the Station. People will be able to see where they stand in their guild, where their guild stands overall, where their team stands overall, that type of thing. So back to your original question, the level 60 guy harvesting the newbie log in Nektulos is going to sooner or later get some person on the opposing team to cap him, because that 60 guy is worth some good points. 

Lum: Is there going to be any kind of story line, events that the GMs are going to run with this? 

Abashi: I don’t know. It’s really.. this is being entirely driven by the development team right now, specific dynamic quests will become more of a reality. I can see us sending dynamic quest people on there… 

Lum: Things like mass invasions, that type of thing. 

Abashi: Yeah. I hope to see a lot of that. Basically what we’re looking for is a way to encourage PvP in Everquest, and fix some of the problems that people are experiencing. By the way I want to mention that with the new server, the teams will be locked down. You will not be able to cast beneficial spells on opposing team members. 

Lum: Can different teams group together, can they send /tells to each other? 

Abashi: We’re talking about completely eliminating cross-team grouping, but we aren’t going to stop tells. 

Lum: I’ve heard one rumor that you were even thinking of getting rid of Common completely. 

Abashi: That’s what we’re looking at for the next server down the line, we’re calling it the RP server, for lack of a better term, which will probably involve the Deity Team model but without PvP. 

Lum: So there would be no crossteaming but no PvP either. 

Abashi: That would basically be the model, yes. We are using the new server as an experiment, to see what we can implement. I’ve mentioned the rules to a number of people at the show, and even talking about experience loss and all of that, it’s actually getting a good reception so far. 

Lum: It sounds interesting so far. 

Abashi: We sat down and talked about it, and one thing that Everquest really lacked is the way to inflict losses on one another. That might not be a politically correct thing for people to do, but that is one reason why people play PvP. 

Lum: Behavior modification. 

Abashi: Yeah. I hope to see this new server as kind of the ultimate RP server. Back to Luclin, here’s a new indoor zone. We’ve got a much higher polygon count, more curved surfaces. Polys that we used to do with textures. Gratuitous use of polygons, at least for this city.
