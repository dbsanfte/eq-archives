<blockquote>While we're waiting why don't we play meridian 59?  It's being hosted by some German company, there's now an english client, and it's free because they can't figure out how to bill Americans.  Any interest?</blockquote><hr><b><font size=2>Table of contents</font></b><hr>

Riprend said he was DLing it, so just to clear up any confusion, if we're going to play we all need to get the same client version.  There are 3. Vale of Sorrows, Dark Auspices, and Renaissance.  I suggest we download Vale of Sorrows, it's the oldest version and doesn't have a lot of new (in my opinion gay) shit that the other two have.  Vale of sorrows is also PvP at it's best IMO becuause it's before they put in bows and any jackass could plug your ass from anywhere on the map.<P>www.meridian-59.de is the link, go to clients on the left hand side and choose the 27.1MB (or something like that) download, in it's German description will appear the words "Server 103".<P>Also it might be a little tough at the start for you guys because the client is all in German, but I'll make alias files so you can type everything in English and distribute them.<BR>

It asks me for bank information. You said I could play for free because they haven't figured out how to bill Americans, seems to me they just don't let Americans play. I don't know any German but I can still tell they're asking for billing information. If you found a way to just play free then tell me how.<P>-Fizzle<BR>Your God

You can play for free because they don't know how to bill.  That doesn't mean you don't put in a credit card, they just can't figure out (or don't care) how to bill Americans.  It's free for americans only.<P><a href="http://www.geocities.com/blackheaveneq" target="_blank">http://www.geocities.com/blackheaveneq</a>/<P>There is a link for help on registering.<BR>

From what I am being told some guys are bringing DSO back as well if your of a mind to play that.<P>There is no word on if they are going with the base game or the patched up game that TEN developed. I hear the orginal version sucked, and the guy who wrote it for TEN made a lot of fixes.<P>www.avatarpatch.com has the excusive rights to start up a server and its gona be free.<P>Div Devlin<BR>
