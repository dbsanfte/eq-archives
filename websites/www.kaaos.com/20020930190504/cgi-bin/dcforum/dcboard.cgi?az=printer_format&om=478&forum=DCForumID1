<blockquote>I wonder if that Brotherhood of the Wolf movie has subtitles.  Based on some true events and every character in the movie, with the exception of the Mohawk Indian, were real people during the time period.  The creature killed over 100 people over a 3 year span between 1764 and 1767.  It became a big problem with England mocking France for not being able to kill a murderous wolf which everyone believed the creature to be, meanwhile King Louis XV offered a substantial reward for the creature's death.  Though the resolution to the situation has many versions, from a huge mixed breed creature with the body of a girl found in its stomach to just a really big wolf, supposedly something was killing quite a number of people in that region.  The movie sticks to the facts until the last 1/3 of the movie where the writers present their theory on the source of the beast.<P>Here's a site with various myths and legends, including the legend that Brotherhood of the Wolf is based on: <P><a href="http://www.theunexplainedsite.com/beastofgevaudan.shtml" target="_blank">http://www.theunexplainedsite.com/beastofgevaudan.shtml</a><P>I heard that DAoC sucks.  From the guilds and people I've heard of that play it, it sounds like a potential Goodie Prison Colony to keep them away from Shadowbane.  Anyone actually try it and find any good points about it?<P>You heard about that Armalion game right?  It looks like it's going to deliver where Poolrad2 failed.  Hopefully.  It lacks in character creation options but has things like horse-riding, climbing, etc.  Being developed by a German company and they still haven't found an American publisher but it's just a matter of time before they do cause the game looks really impressive.  They are still working on their new site but you can still sneak in through the back to the English version of their old site: <P><a href="http://www.armalion.de/English/index2.htm" target="_blank">http://www.armalion.de/English/index2.htm</a><P>The Trailer movie was definitely worth the d/l.  Won't be an MMORPG but a title to watch for.<P>::pays tribute and grovels for a while before departing::</blockquote><hr><b><font size=2>Table of contents</font></b><hr>

Uncanny flick, I was telling a few people about it<BR>in irc. There are some things in it I would consider lame, but the first 90 mins or so rock, then it gets hokie (you'll see what I mean). The imagery, landscapes, and cinematography however, are wicked cool if you get into atmosphere.<P>Rit
