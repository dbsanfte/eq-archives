First, huge level curves suck. I don’t want to spend a year just to max out. I want to spend a month to max out the first time, and possibly just a week every time after that. (Really hard-core gamers would be able to do it even faster.) Then, I want to spend a year becoming the most knowledgeable person in the entire game on the topic of PvP. PvP will only be balanced at the max level because anyone can just gain another lvl and due to the game design of character ability increasing with lvl it will automatically unbalance it. So from now on, assume that I consider everyone to be maxxed out whenever I talk about balanced PvP. 

A little tangent, one thing that does worry me about Shadowbane is the soft cap on levels. If the soft cap is the same as a hard cap except that people still gain levels, they just don’t get anything for it, then it will work. However, if they continue to gain some ability, whether it’s more hp, abilities, or stats, then the game will never be effectively balanced. This whole thing refers back to “the game design of character ability increasing with lvl,” hopefully the soft cap will take away the common game design of advancing character ability when you level up past a certain point. End tangent.

Classes are not the enemy of PvP. I think that classes can be balanced decently enough where people won’t know which class is really the best. This lack of exact information by the players will result in what I call effective balancing. Effective balancing is purely when two classes are so close in ability that two different very knowledgeable PvPers could each say that the other class is slightly better. An example would be a RAM vs. a PALM in NWN. I’ve heard plenty from each side on why each one is better. Can anyone here tell me which one was better, and why? It’s tough to do. And I’d bet that there would be some disagreements between you guys. They are different classes, but they do result in effective balancing where the skill of the player won the battle, not the class they chose. 

From now on, when I say balancing, I mean effective balancing, as nothing is perfect.


	Classes are merely a way of separating skills that people can use. A warrior is obviously going to get more melee-based skills than a wizard. The question becomes, how do you balance something like a warrior with a wizard? The answer is not simplification, the answer is not let the warrior win if he ambushes the wizard, and let the wizard win if he catches the warrior from long range. The answer is: let them be gods. Heh, thought you’d like that one.

	The gods of PvP.
Each class must be able to do everything, to some degree. A warrior should have some ability at range. A mage should have some ability in melee. The problem comes when people think of a warrior as purely a melee character, and they think of a mage as purely a fireball hurler. If that is all they are, then balance is doomed. 

My experiences in Starcraft have shown me that a mage and a warrior can never be equal if one is purely melee based. In Starcraft, I have played many different games where your forces constantly spawn and you try and protect your bunker. I constantly found that the different players were not balanced. Specifically melee units to ranged units. This annoyed me to no end, so I decided to create my own version of it. The first thing I did was to create a balancer map. I created it such that I would have 2 forces line up at opposite ends of the battlefield and then they would charge at each other, completely mindless computer control. What bothered me the most were my battles of Ultralisks vs. Hydralisks. An ultralisk could beat a large number of hydralisks; lets say 5 I don’t want to check right now. However, when I brought the number of total units on each side up high enough, the hydralisks could beat the ultralisks in less than 2:1 ratio, lets say 80 hydras vs. 40 ultras. My initial ratio had the ultras winning in a battle of 100 hydras to 20 ultras. I’m guessing that the hydras could even win in 1:1 ratio given that there was enough of each. What this told me, melee couldn’t possibly be balanced with ranged attack. Not even when the melee attacker is faster than the ranged attacker. Just think about that poor dwarven warrior fighting a centaur archer. Ouch.

	The solution is to give the warrior ranged attacks along with intelligent ways to defend against opposing ranged attacks. In fact, give everyone ranged attacks and ways to defend against ranged attacks. Give everyone an ability to effectively fight in melee. Who ever said that a wizard couldn’t create a giant magical fist to squash you like a pancake? Give everyone some ability to use and defend against magic. Give everybody some ability to move fast, and have stealth. Give them the world; make them gods. 

	What has all of this done? It has balanced the field. Now, every class is almost the same thing, except the people who want different classes have different classes for style. So, it’s popular with the uninformed, and it’s also balanced for those who want good PvP. By making each class more diverse, you are actually making them all closer together.

Let’s take a chessboard to show my point. If you go and make each player completely different, let’s say one person goes with a ton of pawns and another goes with a few rooks, then you are really risking balance. Either the rooks cannot kill the pawns and the pawns finally force the rooks into a corner 1 by 1 or the rooks easily pick off the pawns one by one. Modifying the number of pawns by just 1 either up or down (a nerf) will never balance them out. And the fight is also predetermined, barring utter stupidity. What I would rather do is give everyone 8 pawns, 2 rooks, 2 knights, 2 bishops, a queen and a king. Then, for each player (class) you replace 2 pawns with a knight, or a queen with a rook and a bishop. The balance is there. Without having everyone with the same class.

	This is the same reason why a RAM and a PALM were almost the same. They both had the Mage class to base themselves off of. Then, they just exchanged a knight for two pawns and a bishop for two pawns. Very close balance.

	Sure, each class might try to get into a position that is advantageous to them. They try to use their slight advantages in certain areas to turn the tide of battle in their favor. Of course you did that too in NWN, if you went into a battle with an extra invis you would try harder to use the monsters against your opponent.

Yes, this is asking a decent amount from the developers, but it works.
