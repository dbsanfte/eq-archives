Some responses:

1) I'm not following you on a class system with an easily attainable max leading to a situation of no different CLASSES.  That doesn't seem to be a direct result of having classes and levels.  I can think of ways this CAN happen, by having a single most powerful class, but it doesn't HAVE to.

2) A level system with a reasonable level cap DOES eventually lead to everyone being maxxed.  That's fine.  I LIKE that.  Post-max gaming is where it's at.

3) The xp camping in EQ/AC is a result of the length of their leveling process, not of the fact that there are levels.  ANY system that offers character improvement can be subject to the same issues if they don't make maxxing a reasonably short process.

4) On choosing the wrong class and starting over, I agree.  That IS a serious issue, and in fact it does concern me in terms of how things will work on in SB.  But it's an unavoidable consequence of having character variety.  It's really the EXTENT of effort required to re-tool that is the issue here.

e.g. If you can max and complete a character in 3 hours, it's not so bad (that's an exaggeration just to make the point).  And because of the sharing of info that happens on the net for these games, there's no need for each player to max and try EVERY combination.  Instead, many people will try many combinations - some one person will find a great one, and lots of people will all switch to that.

The leveling treadmill DOES suck, but it's not a DIRECT consequence of classes and levels.  It's merely something ELSE that can be done wrong within ANY character progression system.

A system like UO's had some advantages of course, because instead of starting from scratch, you could re-adjust individual pieces of your character.  But you could have a "skill maxxing treadmill" in UO as easily as a leveling treadmill in EQ.  (shrug)
