Here are the core issues with it, J.

The more diverse your classes, the harder balancing those classes is.  If it's a stated goal to have balanced diverse classes, this will INEVITABLY lead to nerfing.  It has to because there's no way the dev team can accurately predict the innovations of the players.

Now you can classes that are USEFUL and PLAYABLE, but ultimately some single character type will prove itself to be just about the best in terms of PVP and it will be by either ALOT or a little.  If it's alot, the dev team will most likely nerf.  If it's by a little, they MAY nerf.  Either way, some single class will  be the best like it or not.

What sucks is all of the trial and error in trying to FIND that best class.  And then the liability of the fact that if you DO find it and it IS the best, it most likely won't be for long.  Then the cycle will have to repeat.  This creates a long and boring leveling treadmill to find the best PVP class and then re-find it over a few times.

While there's a certain amusement in doing the thinking to pick the best classes, in most PIGs that means killing the 2,000 bunny rabbits in the lowbie areas over and over again.  Boring.

In the meantime there will be alot of angst from people who picked classes that they like stylistically but which are NOT as good.  They will bitch and moan and complain and not have fun.  Until the nerfs.

In the meantime, even if you DO achieve some basic level of balance among classes, they aren't truly balanced.  You end up with more of a rock-paper-scissors thing where given equal player skill, X beats Y beats Z - always.

This is what diversity leads to.  It's inevitable.  And it's dissatisfying to the player who wants to test their human skill against other players.

Look at EQ's little high-level PVP tournaments.  They group character classes for the fights, because if you had an all-classes battle it would be an easy no brainer that all the necros would win.  Period.

Anyway, it's just an axiom.

The more diverse the character types and equipment, the LESS you can say that any given conflict was won by the player as opposed to the luck of who had the better character/equipment for that encounter.  Which means that ultimately human skill has been chopped out of the equation.

And this:

"I'm not saying that all the uncertainty is a good thing, nor am I looking forward to dying a lot. But I don't necessarily see it as a problem, given that most players will never be able to figure out PvP on any level but the most rudimentary, and no matter who wins, history can still be written by the losers."

Amounts to saying - "Who cares what happens?  PVP and its results are meaningless."  Huh?
