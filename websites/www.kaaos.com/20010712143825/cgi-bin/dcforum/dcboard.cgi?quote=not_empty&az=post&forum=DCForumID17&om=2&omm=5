         a) I wasn't aiming that at you J.  I've seen you digging for real information and I appreciate the effort.  I was aiming that at Wolfpack for using the delaying tactics of sending us a bunch of "backstory bullshit" instead of real information.<P>b) I think its sad that nobody has the balls to call BULLSHIT to Wolfpack for providing us with no more than useless fiction and I think its SADDER that the news sites are so desperate for hits that they would actually prop this "hot discussion" up as news.  Take, for example, the hot exclusive interview:<P>Vosx: Hey man - this Game of Thrones book by George R. Martin that I bought Sat night is awesome!....<BR>Ashen Temper: Good! I am actually finishing up the trilogy by C.S. Friedman...<BR>Vosx: This one is also three books. Ive been wanting to get it for a year or....<BR>Ashen Temper: Sweet, I'll go by Barnes & Nobles today and grab them...<BR>Vosx: Did you ever read the Tad williams series?<BR>Ashen Temper: The Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn one... didn't read his SciFi one, though<P>WoW!  Man, that is mind numbingly intense journalism.  I am stunned that Vosx was able to pry such informative bits of information from Wolfpack...            Jesus Christ on a Stick!<P>c) Info about their previous exploits are not readily available on your news site or any other, to my knowledge.  At leastt that I can find AND I don't think its an inane question... certainly its a better question that how do you misspell "Zaeristan, Zerystan, and others..."  When I went to E3 (on my own buck) and interviewed Wolfpack they told me they thought the idea up whilst drinking beer in college... <P>(That's when Marduk started asking if I wanted to put up a rant site under the Crossroads banner-ads.  I told him I didn't want to feel forced to come up with ass-kiss-content or be unable to rip Crossroads a new ass when the mood strikes me)    <BR> <BR>d) Not reading the backstory stuff makes me an inane, apathetic, jackass eh?... ROFL.  How's this?  I think your unfinished column about how much we don't know is one of the greatest displays of general apathy I've ever seen... so nya nya ::chuckle::  STFU<P>e) "It was still a cool story. Before you read it, have a beer."  Maybe I will.  Maybe I did but think its bullshit.  Then again... maybe I wont.  You asked if I was reading the stuff... I told you it's bullshit.  You got pissy.  Examine your reasons for getting so defensive, then give me a reason to read CrossVault of ShadowStratics.  <P>Lets put it this way... if you were looking for the mechanics of how an upcoming Ferrari engine worked... would you want to see discussions of Italian Literature on Car & Driver's web page?? <P>f) "kthxbuhbye"  Yeah.  Fuck you too.<P>~f
