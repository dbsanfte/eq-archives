<blockquote><BR>Since Infernal Elite has climbed to the top of Overall Guilds on SZ, I'm wondering where the little bitches of TCE (house of wrath) have run to?  Hiding in frustration?  Humiliation?  You guys still the Champions of West Commons?  LOL ;)<P>TCE talked a lot of shit about a month ago on these boards how they want to kick our ass, and /guildwar us.  I don't see much mouth now.  Have your nutsacks shriveled up, just like all the rest who fuck with us?<P>LOL, didn't we tell you gimps it would be like this?  Didn't we tell you we owned you?  I suppose every little bitch has to see for themselves tho.  Ya'd think history would teach you dumbasses SOMETHING though.<P>*laughs*<P>Malhavok<BR>KAAOS<P><BR></blockquote><hr><b><font size=2>Table of contents</font></b><hr>

They can't even take one level 30 Druid who has destroyed their entire guild. They have become Feyd's favorite prison bitch, and the sodomy has gotten so bad that they have accused this level 30 of being multiplayed because hes so high level? roflmao! AND a cheater for using tracking and spirit of cheetah - and I haven't heard the 'cheater cheater' bit since early UO - I swear to god, Im suprised they haven't slipped yet and said UOX UOX UOX!!!!<P>I'm glad you left this bunch of turds for us to savor. That tart stench of lameness they excrete just puts a pep in my step every single damn day.<P>So thanks for leaving us these precious treasures called TCE.<P>Oh yeah, and another thing... so it won't look like we are pandering to the so called gods by participating in this afterbirth of a topic on TCE.... and giving thanks and what not...<P>Fuck You.<P>Yours truly,<BR>VA

Arioch... try doing something YOURSELF rather then letting one member of your guild get your points. HAHA VA are cowards who hide behind 1 man..<P><BR>As for KAAOS.. you couldnt hack it yourself.. you couldnt stay up with the majority so you joined others... TOGETHER you can get high but uhmmm IE was already high so i am sure CC is happy your taking credit for THEM doing all the work arent they?? Why hasnt CN decided to join up yet?? hmm.. maybe because they can hack it alone and dont need wimps like KAAOS taking their credit! At least TCE did this AS TCE and didnt sell out after proclaming that<P>"KAAOS doesnt need allies or numbers! And elite group of people is better than 50 casual gamers!"<P>And yet you felt you had to join another guild to stay afloat... pathetic.

Lol TCE intelligence shining thru again. When KAAOS left our tag and joined under IE (which had been the plan anyway) we were 800 point behind IE. As for CN? Do you even play EQ and know what's going on? Apparently not you mindless dolt. CN has been part of the IE tag for the last 2 weeks and their old tag is still 4x your pitiful points. I imagine the CN tag will sit well above yours for quite some time. Know your facts before you open your trap. No go back to cowering from the 1 VA member that seems to own your entire guild &lt;smirk&gt;.<P><P><P>SangDraxx<BR>KAAOS<BR>The Serpent Lord<P><BR>

And you are??? Oh yeah nothing to me.<P>Doesnt change the fact and you seem to "omit" it that you joined forces to keep your numbers high because you were slipping.

I really shouldn't have anything to say on this topic. I do not know the situation in EQ too well. However, your idiocy gives me enough material to write a novel.<P>"Your getting owned hardcore"<P>Ya know, you almost worried me about your sanity because you told kaaos that they were getting owned hardcore. Then I read this.<P>"you suck because Eye of Newt killed a member of yours"<P>LOL. Your entire claim to owning them is killing a single member of KAAOS, I guess I should assume it's true because it isn't much of a claim to fame.<P>TCE has been a joke for over a year now, and before that it was just plain unknown. TCE has alienated any possible ally or new recruit. There are no more replacements, each member you lose is permanent. Your guild is dieing, and not just in EQ to a single person. The members of TCE can abandon ship and save some face or you can continue to rot away. Don't worry, with your intelligence, I'm sure that you'll manage to lose face wherever you go.<P>I'll be here, enjoying the stench of TCE, I always love watching things decay.<P>As for KAAOS joining up with another guild. KAAOS has evolved, I think your guild still has more members than KAAOS and it's allies, yet they have absolutely destroyed you in the numbers game. <P>Your guild recruits every reject that comes along, yet you try to insult 2 other guilds for grouping together for a common goal. You're an idiot. You can't comprehend much of anything, you will go down with the ship because you have already lost all face. All that is left is a few more stern ass-kickings.<P>Enjoy.<P>Mortarion<BR><i>The god of death and decay</i>

Oh yeah nothing to me"<P>The mere fact that you sit at your keyboard waiting for a response from your gods shows what we mean to you. We are the cream in your coffee,a means to your end, the light at the end of your tunnel. Without KAAOS recognition you would simply fade away into nothingness. The pure simplicity of your nature and your presence on these boards denotes the obvious to everyone skippy. <P>"Doesnt change the fact and you seem to "omit" it that you joined forces to keep your numbers high because you were slipping. Face it.. own up to it... and we have plenty of screenshots of Feyd's death at our members hands so if you wanna play this game.."<P>Hmmm I must have missed something in your incoherent ramblings. Where did I omit anything? We have been playing togather as Infernal Elite on Tallon Zek for monthes now monkey boy. Again I ask that you get your facts straight before you make an ass of your self in public. As for your screenshots of this guy's death neither I nor the rest of KAAOS could give a damn what the east commonlands crowd are doing to pass their time. You keep right on a fighting the brave battle over there punk.<P>"Your getting owned hardcore.. you suck because Eye of Newt killed a member of yours.. you pansie.."\<P>Take a look at the daily rankings and tell me who is getting owned hardcore. I surely don't see TCE anywhere near the top 10 much less the number one spot like IE.<P>"You chickened out.. and joined another guild so you can claim dominance... wow im impressed. "<P>We don't claim dominance, we exude it. Everything about us  lnspires fear and awe from gutter rats like yourselves. We are the top rung of the evolutionary ladder while you son are merely the puddle at the bottom. Back to east commonlands with you.<P><BR>SangDraxx<BR>KAAOS<BR>The Serpent Lord<P><BR>

You have any from the inside of your asshole? Ive been there several times, but wasn't much left of it sad to say. I'd pay well for a picture, as a sort of keep sake, for a fonder time when you resembled a key hole, and not the lincoln tunnel.

<BR>Yea, I know they were/are a joke.  I just wanted everyone else to see it too.  Didn't need to paint a picture, really, as it's very apparent they're nothing more than mouth.<P>It's fun to watch them get owned tho <img src="http://www.kaaos.com/htdocs/dcforum/Images/bigsmile.gif">

Funny how TCE chose the same team as KAAOS/IE, talks their shit, and yet still won't duel.
