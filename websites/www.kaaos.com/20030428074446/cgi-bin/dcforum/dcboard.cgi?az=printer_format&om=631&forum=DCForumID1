<blockquote>I thought it would be interesting to know what kinds of class would greatly enhance a gamers pvp without too much hassle and mumbo jumbo or obtacles that comes with each class. <P>A mage is just a weakling that can fart out a bunch of killer spells in a few seconds.<P> A tank type of class with alot of health and short range attacks but very fast on foot can be ran over with a truck and still survive. <P>A thief/assasin can hide and attack at the best moment; mostly when a guy is at his weakest.<P>An archer hider is just plain gay and can get away without getting killed most times. Much like a drive by shooting.<P>Blade Sabre wrote, "Balanced PvP can be achieved by not letting the class of a player make too much difference. Variables brought into the fight should not have as much effect as what happens in the fight."<P>Tell me what you think makes a good game to play with pvp. Is it a certain class, skills, or special weapons? </blockquote><hr><b><font size=2>Table of contents</font></b><hr>

Ok since no one here has a brain to give us all feedback (much like most forums); I will give away my feedback. I posted this very same topic and got much better feedback. What makes a good person verses person game? One person said it takes a good healing mix with the right timing. That same person is trying to be a designer and failed to get back to me to expand the idea. Another person said it takes a mix of different fighting styles much to do with your own set of skills. Ultima has done both of these characteristics but failed to make it in a good engine or design of code that will not make it lag so much. They also failed to have it all on one or two servers so many people can play and fight at the same time. <P>To have your own set of skills and subskills is the answer. Shadowbane does not promote it becouse you can only have one choice with a profession. Neocron has gone half way with being able to start out with the four basic templates. <P>You know what these two games have in common? It takes time to invest in your class and even then you are not promised to be the best pvp out there. It is about speed and what to DO with the skills you have gained. <P>Planetside will be the best game in the next 10 years and will fill the void. Why you may ask? Go do your own fucking research lazy bitches, Har Har Har!

"To have your own set of skills and subskills is the answer. Shadowbane does not promote it becouse you can only have one choice with a profession"<P>Shadowbane has 4 base classes, 19 professions, and 28 disciplines.  The professions themselves are flexible enough to allow you to play multiple types of characters using the same profession (ex: a bow wielding, dex based ranger vs. a two handed, str based ranger).  Add to this the ability to choose up to three professions and you have the most customizable character creation available to date.  I fail to see how you could ever consider this lacking in regards to having your own set of skills and subskills.  The truth is, there are so many professions that you can play pretty much any type of character you want...unless of course you are wanting to play a character who can tank, backstab, nuke, and heal and do all 4 as well as a primary class.  If that's the case, then no one can help you.<P>As for what makes a good PvP game, I think a certain degree of individuality in your character is nice, but the most important aspect is that PvP must revolve around skill and strategy.  There have to be multiple paths of action that a person can take to achieve victory and multiple ways of countering these actions.  This allows each battle to be unique and focuses on the skill of the player.

True you can decide on which three professions you want to have but you are stuck with it unless you start a new character. So you are right you can have three choices but you start off with one at a time.

There are a lot of people in this guild with an opinion on what makes for a good PvP game. I didn’t respond because I do not believe you are capable of understanding anything outside your own little opinions. You are blind. In addition to being blind you appear to be deaf, dumb and stupid. I’m sure many others haven’t responded for the same reason, they may as well just talk to a wall.<P>However, this is an interesting topic. I’m going to reply but not for your benefit because I do not believe you will understand what I am saying. It would be lost solely on you. I am replying for my own benefit, because reflection on topics such as these interest me, and for the benefit of other readers who may find this topic interesting. <P>Before I get to “what makes a good PvP game” I’m going to go into a little bit about why PvP is essential for the RPG environment....<P>Most people gaming today do not understand the true appeal of RPG PvP. Nor do they understand what is supposed to make it unique. This is due to the fact that most gamers today are post AD&D pen and paper popularity and post oNWN. They simply have never experienced it so how could they know? To understand the attraction, for many, of RPG PvP you really must experience it first hand.<P>RPG PvP is different than FPS type combat for a very distinct reason. RPG’s are about character, FPS is simply about fraging. Now, some people like fragging and some people like RPG’s. The entertainment value of each is subjective to the individual. I am partial to RPG’s so this is where my perspective stems from.<P>So from that standpoint, what makes RPG combat entertaining? I feel that RP is what really makes RPG combat entertaining (and unique from FPS, among other genres). RP doesn’t have to include a lot of thee’s and thou’s. RP is about fantasy, assuming a role created by your imagination. This is much easier for the individual in a solo type format. It’s when you add the MMO that it becomes much more difficult. You see, although RP is about fantasy this fantasy needs to be based on certain truths. In a solo format that truth is whatever the individual makes it. However, in an MMO format, truth is created by the masses. Your imagination is limited to what is believable by the masses. If you do not stay within these truths then your experience and the experience of others around you will be dulled to the point of inanity.<P>For example, say you want to be a super hero. Sounds kind of cool right? You, the SUPERHERO! You will RP a SUPERHERO! SUPERHERO GEO TO THE RESCUE! But, what is a superhero? A Superhero is a figure endowed with superhuman powers. Well, what is “superhuman”? Superhuman is basically “beyond ordinary”. <P>So now you are RPing a superhero in a forum you share with 10,000 other people who also are acting out a role. Guess what those 10,000 other people want to be......you guessed it, SUPERHEROES! So now you and 10,000 other people are running around acting out being superheroes. That would make you.....well....kind of.....ordinary. So the truth that you and the masses have created is that superheroes are actually not superheroes at all. <BR>Which “fantasy” world would you rather act out being a superhero in. One where everyone is a superhero so that when you walk into the room posing with your fists on your hips and say “I am GEO, faster than a speeding bullet, stronger than a locomotive, able to leap tall buildings in a single bound!” and everyone replies “shut up wuss”? Or would you rather act out a superhero in an environment where the mere sight of you makes lesser men’s knees tremble in fear, awe or respect (whatever be your RP flavor)?<P>The great thing about fantasy environments is that the people who enjoy them are very passionate about fantasy. The core fantasy fans realize there has to be peons, there has to be peasants, there has to be toothless whores. Without these, fantastic people and fantastic feats are not fantastic at all. And when that happens, your fantasy world just looks like an extension of real life rather than a separate world entirely. Nobody wants to be the piss boy but this core will carry the bucket if they have to, if they are forced to......if the truth is that they truly ARE the piss boy. They will do it because they enjoy fantasy and they want to be a part of the fantasy environment even if they must do it as the piss boy. Even as the piss boy they will be a part of the environment, they will witness fantastic people and fantastic feats. <P>So how do you make one realize that they are the piss boy? You must create that truth. This is what is so unique about RPG PvP. This is why MMORPG’s without PvP will NEVER be a good fantasy experience. A GOOD PvP system can and will create a truth for the masses that they must and will respect. Once this foundation of truth is laid RPG can and will flourish, without it...............Well, it’s just one big toilet bowl.<P>So now we get to the topic of “what makes a good PvP game”. Aside from “it must be entertaining” because that is a given....<P>PvP has to create a truth. “I am a superhero”. People must believe that you are “beyond ordinary” for that “claim” to have any sort of truth (or power, or weight, or what-have-you). PvP must be skill based in so much that if player A is better than player B, player A is simply better than player B. Don’t get me wrong, there doesn’t have to be ONE top dog but there needs to be, for lack of a better word, social classes of players. <P> “Character class” (diversity or lack thereof), “skills”, “special weapons”, etc. are all frosting. Without the cake, frosting is just a blob of sugared shit. Some people like cake without frosting and others like cake with frosting. Whichever you prefer is fine and there should be different games that appeal to different palates but regardless, THERE HAS TO BE A DAMN CAKE. There is not one MMORPG out there right now that is a cake, they are all just big blobs of sugared shit......<P>Unfortunately that’s all the time I have for right now. I’ll continue this a bit later and I’ll get more into specifics about some of the requirements for a good PvP system.<P>Azmodion<BR>KAAOS

I can understand that it takes a certain character or RPer to bring life to a game. The feeling of a certain hero player or group of players ready to chop your head off might make that person very afraid since they know they will soon be dead. This makes a good REAL RP feeling and IS the great foundation of player verses player environment. So there is a certain time building up courage to fight the super hero like you brought out very clear even for the peon. As you can see, I am not blind to that.<P> I am blind to the KAAOS dream of being able to bring pure evil to a game. All a person has to do if they are being harassed or slaughtered over and over again is to stop playing with the person bringing evil actions to him/her and to begin playing in a more newbie town or play another character in a different faction or clan. That way the roles are reversed and the hunted become the hunter. <P>So in short I do agree Role Play brings a great deal of excitement before a fight, during a fight, and after a fight. Most times I would wait a few seconds getting pumped up like the old western movies before a gunfight duel. The Matrix would also be a good example along with Bruce Lee movies. <P>There has to be anticipation and preparation. A style along with dialogue as well to have a good pvp game.<P>Not any surprise you’re dead!

First of all, to answer the question “What makes a good pvp game: Classes, skills, or many special weapons?” I’d have to say....... “none of the above”. In fact, many classes, many skills and/or many special weapons could do a lot to harm “good PvP”. These are nothing more than icing for the cake. Icing needs to be used in moderation or at the very least needs to have a pre-planned quantity. Simply dumping these, willy nilly, on a pvp game will cause a severe imbalance. The bottom line is, none of these have anything to do with “good PvP”. <P>A good PvP system has to have a method to the madness. There has to be a reason the values are the values. No value can go unchecked. Good PvP games start at development. PvP should be designed first, from the end game. So the developers need to decide where the end game is going to be and start designing the combat system from that point. Once that is balanced and complete the rest of the game can be designed around it. The main problem with most of the games out there right now is they all seem to be designed from the ground up. This is a big problem for PvP balance at the end game. I know Shadowbane basically had their game complete before they started to really tackle PvP balance. Which is why it is not balanced and is not very good.<P>PvP needs to have a strong solo combat element. Games today, more and more, are being built with mass combat in mind. Adding to the design to enhance mass combat is great but only after solo combat is at the desired state. By solo I mean 1 on 1. Roleplay from a guild perspective is great but you need to have role-play for the individual before you can expect any meaningful role-play for the group. Again, true role-play, in the MMO format I believe, is going to come from a strong PvP combat system. <P>5000000 class combinations is fine if it doesn’t muddy up the PvP system. In the case of many classes/combinations the game should be balanced with 1 class or a handful of classes in mind. They will be the leading solo PvP classes and they should be balanced off each other. The other classes should be support classes and they should not be expected to win a PvP match against a main solo class (given equal player skill). Support classes can be added to “enhance” group combat or the RP experience.<P>PvP should not be designed with 1 shot kills or balance tipping situational elements (like initiative being the weighted deciding factor). Fights should last longer than a few casts or a few seconds.<P>PvP should not be designed so that pure number of players is a deciding factor. 1 + 1 should not automatically equal 2 and 2 should not always be &gt; 1.. Counter tactics and/or false tactics can help mitigate the problem of 2 less skilled players being more powerful than a skilled player. Combat needs to be about more than just “press button A and deal X damage”. Additionally, healing alone is not a valid counter tactic and developers need to stop relying on this single element.<P>The truth about combat needs to be the same for all classes. For every action there is generally a cost associated. PvP is about resources. For example, in just about every game to date, casting a spell had a cost. This cost is different in different games. Some the cost is only time, some the cost is mana, some the cost is a spell slot, some had combinations of cost (casting time + mana), etc. You cast a spell, you deal so much damage.for such and such cost. Enter melee combat. I have not seen melee combat and casting combat using the same system of resource expenditure in any game to date. Melee and caster combat are typically working on 2 totally different set of truths. This makes for a balance nightmare. Melee and caster combat needs to be using the same basic system (output vs. cost).<P>Stats are getting out of hand as well. Stats need to have a reasonable range. Pure numbers don’t really matter but the range of numbers needs to be manageable and balanced. The biggest problem with a wide range of stats is seen when you put class A next to class B. Melee classes have generally used a format to tell if an attack is successful. Casters generally, have used a different format. Typically these formats are not balanced off each other for each different type of class that have, in the past, been using very different types of systems. For example, you have a warrior with 3000 health and physical defense rating of 2000 facing a caster with 1000 health and a physical defense rating of 500. Right there, you should see a problem. Warrior attack ratings are usually designed in line with warrior defense ratings. With such a large disparity between warrior defense ratings and caster defense ratings, you end up with a situation where every attack by the warrior is successful on a caster. Similarly, if a game used the same check (and some games use a similar check) for whether or not the caster lands a spell you would end up with a situation where a caster either A) never land a cast on a warrior or B) always land a cast on another caster. Additionally, for a caster to kill a warrior he would need to dish out an assload of damage. Put that same damage output up against another caster with only 1000 health and you get ridiculously quick caster vs. caster combat. <P>Caster combat should be strategic and tactical, it shouldn’t be just about pure damage output. The very “idea” of magic lends for a wide array of attack types and/or defensive “moves”. The very limits are subject only to the imagination. You can argue all you want about how cool different melee “forms” could/would be but melee is at the core “swing sword do damage”. It is a physical action causing a physical effect that every gamer relates to. It could never be and should never be as strategic and/or tactical as caster combat. If it is, you are doing a disservice to your system by dummying down caster combat to such a large degree. Melee limitations are not bound only in imagination here, they are bound by what we are willing to accept on the physical level. Now, what we are willing to accept on a physical level can vary per the individual but it is a much more difficult proposition to get the masses to accept total disregard for the laws of physics in this case. Meanwhile, magic has no real world counterpart that could make the masses say “wait a minute, if you cast a fireball it shouldn’t be able to travel at such and such trajectory, that is physically impossible”.<P>Hell, I could go on for days but to wrap this up “what makes for good PvP”.....<P>To have good PvP the game needs to be designed to allow player skill to shine through, especially in a 1 on 1 environment. To allow player skill to shine through the system needs to have 1 set of truths about combat or 1 set of fundamentals. The game needs to have tempered stats. The game needs to have counter tactical and or/false tactical options other than simply healing. Combat needs to last more than a few seconds. Pure initiative needs to be defanged. <P>Hmm, I feel like I’m missing some other key elements here but that about sums up the items I touched on. That is not to say this is the full range of “important” elements to PvP. There are many, many more elements that need to be considered. Especially since the very nature of balance is to create a linear environment. Pure linear environments can be boring. This is another important consideration. <P>Azmodion<BR>KAAOS

I liked the counter invasion maneuvering points. But I think all these invasion maneuvers were left to the mage and peacemakers and rouges with Ultima.<P><P> An Ultima Online warrior has a hard time to win against a veteran mage just because they don't have enough mana to heal real well. Sometimes they are immobile which most often makes the weapon they use useless. Maybe that is why they were forced to use special weapons such as using a blessed vanquishing halbert against a mage or using a special hide cloak with magic deflect clothing. The game encouraged gayness with house fighting, server lines, and gate jumping as well.<P>This is the reason there were tournaments. These were fun because no loot was taken most times and no magic was used with weapons. If I was still playing I would implement two guilds and they would have a no looting rule. There would be fights inside a house or dungeon and no running off the screen. One of my best times with Ultima had to be using a X-bow going inside a building or crypt. <P>I agree that standard blessed equipment would be the best way to play pvp. Just like the four factions can use with silver. Another good part is the fighting inside and outside of buildings and rooms. That way people can retreat while mages cast paralyze walls behind the team. The main problem the factions idea has is the number of players on each side.<P><BR>FYI – Planetside has it so if a player dies they still can get standard equipment for free.

UO was a poor example of a PvP system. I will give it this though, it was at least mildly entertaining in the early days. <P>1 on 1 fights in UO’s system were linear though. Given two equally skilled opponents, the victor was the person who didn’t mess up their timing of extremely repetitious keyboard pouncing. 1 on 1 fights between two equally skilled opponents was pretty boring. I remember before Pharismod was KAAOS, he was an “enemy” of KAAOS. We ran into each other in a dungeon (I think it was Deceit) and commenced to fighting. At this time there was never a cordial word between KAAOS and Pharismod. I wouldn’t go so far as to use the term hate but there was an extreme amount of hostility between him and us. While we were at each other’s throats on the boards for several months, this was the first time Pharismod and a KAAOSer actually faced off in the field. So you see, winning this fight was pretty important to both Pharismod and myself. We fought for what seemed like hours. The whole time we were verbally assaulting each other, each trying to get the other out of synch. This drug on for so ridiculously long that we both started to get extremely bored. Eventually 2 gimps came up to us to “watch” the fight. Well, Pharismod and I both turned on them and burned them down then began fighting each other again. After about another 20 minutes (and dancing back and forth over pretty much the entire dungeon) we both agreed the fight was pretty pointless. We stopped fighting and Pharismod gave me a lift back to town. Oh the inanity of it all.<P>Group fights were different. In UO, group fights would be over very quickly. Focus fire made short work of large groups. There wasn’t much skill involved though, it was a basic number scenario. The group that could gain the number advantage would win. If your group was smaller than the other group you had to make sure that you didn’t lose anyone before you could better the odds. <P>As I said, early UO was at least “entertaining” but it was not a very good system. Nothing since UO has been any better but that still doesn’t make UO a good example of PvP. UO was fun because of macroing and looting. Looting only works in a game like UO because equipment is readily available and easily attainable. There were counter-tactics in UO but not many, not compared to oNWN. UO is a basic example of mindless PvP. <P>Azmodion<BR>KAAOS

But read on, you might learn something.<P>You had pouches, potions, healing, magic cloths, magic weapons, and that’s not counting hiding, music, magic deflect, armor, recall and that mage armor spell that seemed to be a good idea.<P>A counter attack is defined as a way in which the opponent has some sort of option whereby you can divert or minimize the attack against yourself. <P>Potions have to be one since you said healing can be a way. They minimize damage and the effects that damage brought with each weapon.<P>Healing would be a way to minimize damage as well. And this is not just an easy way to get out of a jam. It takes skill and the more kinds of healing you have the better you can counter attack.<P>Magic cloths added strength, so that would minimize the chance of that person getting killed by an attack. So that would be a counter attack. Magic cloths also gave that person the ability to hide.  An item of clothing could also have magic deflect charges. <P>Magic weapons should not be in the list so I can agree with you there. If only there was a sword that can heal. The only weapon could be a magic wand (mace weapon) that could be used and the charges could be healing.<P>Hiding will stop you from getting killed. That way you can heal with bandages in peace.<P>Music would have to be one since it is needed with peacemaking. A very useful counter attack when fighting monsters mainly. <P>Armor would be the counter attack item of choice for the warrior. <P>Recall would greatly reduce the amount of hit points that would come in the future. Making a recall rune when in a fight would be fun to do as well. That way you can recall to the place where you were fighting after you heal up. <P>Reactive armor would prevent a mage to have damage the first one or two hits. <P><BR>You did not play UO…maybe you’re not authorized to grade me on that subject since I played for three years.

The proper use of those items can sometimes be tactics or counter-tactics; however, combat systems based on what you bring to combat (items) rather than what you do during combat are inherently lame. What you listed are still items, not tactics. <P>Hiding and recall are both ways of escaping from a fight. They are the "I lost, but I don't like being looted" buttons of UO. If you need to use either of those, then yes, you have lost the fight. Don't try stroking your ego by calling them tactics. If you use them within a combat, you've used them because your opponent was better than you. <P>So without even playing the game, I have once again schooled you on it.

Well you tried to weasel your way out of the hiding tactic and recall tactic of Ultima lets see you try to weasel your way out of this one.<P><BR>Running away from an attack is part of these tactics.

Tactics would be the action, but doesn’t it sometimes take an object to complete this action? You open a trapped pouch which takes action. This is a counter tactic since it takes action.

I had fun making that post, that's all life is about. But if you want to challenge me on that formula instead of being a moron then go right ahead.<P> You have to have certain moves in a game to have a counter tactic. In chess a tactic is made by a few moves. A move or a few moves can be a counter tactic which is an action or the time it takes to use an item. It has to be a counter move becouse if you dont open up the trapped pouch then your not going to save your health.<P>So counter tactics = time it takes for an action + time it takes to use the item - time it takes the attacker to use his item again

BTW<P>You can also run to a battle which is considered to be part of an attack.

U R write ROFLOL!!<P>Like if someone attacks u with a knife you can run to the toilet and take a shit. The smell will kill them. So running is an attack! ROFLOL!!<P>But if they r smart like me they will have a cloths pin and will plug their nose. Plugging nose = counter-tactic. Clothes pin = item. Counter-tactic plus Item=Counterattack!!

<BR>If you are playing Ultima and you are on horseback then this increases the speed of the attack as well as the speed of the weapon. So speed + sword = strong attack. This can be applied to running being an attack. If you ever played Ultima then you would know that running or using a horse would play a big part of a counter-attack or even a counter-tactic. This would NOT be retreating since you can easily heal up with the counter-tactic then follow up with a counter-attack.<P>Guy on horse gets hit with axe. Guy on horse gallops away using a counter-tactic till he heals then gallops back to counter-attack the attacker. This can be done with running as well. <P><BR>Now maybe you can apologize to me since you know I am right.

Ah yes but then I counter-attack with hay and cereal!! Hay is for horses and tricks are for kids you silly rabbit. So your horse stops to eat the hay and you stop to eat the cereal. Then I smash you with my axe and all you can do is stand there screaming “GOT MILK?”. <P>So as you can see hay is an attacks as is cereal. ROFLOL!!<P>Now maybe you will apologize to me for being such a retard.

The horse would obey its master and will be apart of the attack or the counterattack. In Ultima the horse would obey the master becouse you didn't have to have animal taming to keep it tame.

Ok you might of been right this time. A counter attack would not be the same as a counter-tactic. But I was partly right by using the word counter-tactic instead of counter-attack. <P>When I used the counter-tactic term, I listed items that could counter the attack. Some of the items could be used to attack such as an explosion potion. But most could be used to counter the attack or minimize the damage.

I am just messing with yall, I am geo as well. GeostormS would be the character that I played in Ultima, geo is just my nickname here. <P>I must admit I am getting tired of saying counter-tactics and counter-attacks. But it was not I that was misunderstanding my posts, it was the reader who demanded that I used to word strategy instead becouse of the items involved for the Ultima game.<P>The game cause just as much hassle with getting skills while dealing with lag as with these forums.<P> skill gaining + lag = a fucked up Ultima programmer<P>evil bitches + geo = fucked up forum
