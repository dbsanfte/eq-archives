Thread Subject: Yer killing me here with your stupidity

Here's a little internal communication for you.  We fight on whatever terms we feel like.  And we play to win.

If YOU are doing something OTHER than that... then you're an idiot.  And I can't help you.

Just because YOU aren't worth our time doesn't mean nobody is. (laugh)

From: Turmoyle

On the lighter side...I was grouped with some guys and Riprend in Kurn's Tower last night.  Some level 8 monk asked if he could join, so Rip says "If you were a shaman we'd let you because you could heal".  The dude got pissed and started training us with skeletons, killing 2 of our group members.  Then he said, "I'm a monk, I was just pulling.  That's what monks do.  If I was a shaman, I'd heal you."  I actually laughed ;p

He left Kurn's and went out to Field of Bone.  After about 5 minutes, I ran out and /shouted "Is anyone grouped with Vengence.  If so, send me a /tell".  One of the 2 guys he was grouped with repsonded, so I told him to disband Vengence immediately or I'd train them all as payback for our group deaths.  He didn't respond.  I went and found them in the middle of a fight and repeated my order to disband him.  One of the lippy guys with him said, "Just a sec. and I'll kill you".

Being the patient God that I am, I waited.  After they finished with the mob, the guy runs over and /d's me!  Naturally, I accepted.  I started to whip his ass by jousting him, to which he replied, "Stand still you pussy!".  LOL!  As luck would have it, during the middle of our fight, 2 Greater Skeletons wander past.  I grabbed the skels and trained his ass.  His buddies jumped in and got them off of him, but not before I could taunt him and his stupidity.  To make a long story short (too late ;p), I kept jousting and he kept whining.  I eventually chased him from the zone and got my first SZ duel victory screenshot, along with some great whine.
 
I'm going to REALLY like this server.  ;p
