Evil One, lurked the blackest of hates...&quot;</FONT></FONT></P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P><FONT COLOR="#C0C0C0"><FONT SIZE=+1>The initial concept of KAAOS
took form in 1992, on AOL, in Neverwinter Nights. A bored assassin named
Malhavok, and an evil companion named Chaosium grew weary of Neverwinter
and it's environs. They sought to create a Guild of the purest evil, and
a blossoming new land called Yserbius, on The Sierra Network, beckoned
them and their creation. But what to call it? Early on, the name 'Guild
Of Death' was tossed around. We would call ourselves GOD's. (See? Didn't
come from where ya thought. ;p). But that was replaced when the suggestion
Killing As An Organized Sport was mentioned. Besides, KAAOS sounded cooler
than Guild of Death. ;)</FONT></FONT></P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P><FONT COLOR="#C0C0C0"><FONT SIZE=+1>They journeyed to Yserbius
with 4 or 5 stalwart friends and set up shop in the Hell Hole. Early on,
even before the game went &quot;live&quot;, the role-playing citizens of
TSN (now known as the financially troubled ImagiNation Network) had but
two choices in Guilds: the goodies known as Soul's Brigade, and the evils
known as KAAOS. Soul's Brigade arrived first...setting up a large foundation
of members, before KAAOS' arrival. There was no &quot;game&quot; yet to
speak of, but the role-playing message boards were alive with tales of
how Soul's Brigade or KAAOS would rule the new realms. Time passed and
Malhavok and his few companions dabbled in the fine art of &quot;member
acquisition&quot;. The creator of Soul's Brigade, SoulForge, had a grand
vision of domination, but his pride, lack of diplomacy skills and ego all
played into the hands of KAAOS. First, the Soul's Brigade's AGMs saw the
glory of KAAOS, then the other members became enlightened. Ulitmately,
a mere week before The Shadow of Yserbius went live, Soul's Brigade disbanded
and KAAOS grew strong, taking only the most select members.</FONT></FONT></P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=+1>Many guilds claimed to have
been the &quot;first&quot; guild in TSN's Shadow of Yserbius, including
many stragglers from the defunct Soul's Brigade (now a &quot;Soul-less&quot;
Brigade). Believe me when I tell you, from a purely historical view, KAAOS
was the *1st* fully formed, organized Guild to set foot into TSOY. Malhavok
and Chaosium personally made the very *1st* non-staff posts on the message
boards inside the game. Take it to the bank.</FONT></FONT> <BR>

begins&quot;</FONT></FONT></I></B></P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P><FONT COLOR="#C0C0C0"><FONT SIZE=+1>Time passed on TSOY and
KAAOS grew. PVP skill, and getting the best weapons were the main ways
to show guild dominance in those days. KAAOS had plenty of both (as usual
;&gt;). Members came and went as they pleased, and achieved all in the
name of KAAOS. Tuesday night Hell Hole meetings were loads of fun and KAAOS
was active. The infamous &quot;Say something Evil!&quot; initiation process
insured only the truly worthy were accepted into the ranks of KAAOS. Other
guilds formed...Aegis, TheMercs, the Bhall's, KOY (TSOY's version of COR),
and others all took up residence in Yserbius and one year of battles, bragging,
adventuring and rp fun passed quickly. The entity known as KAAOS thrived.</FONT></FONT></P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P><FONT COLOR="#C0C0C0"><FONT SIZE=+1>But soon, after only 1 year,
many grew tired of Yserbius' limited gameplay and poor interface. An upgrade
appeared on the horizon, but Malhavok longed for the better combat/PVP
engine and superior quality of AOL's Neverwinter Nights. There was no real
&quot;area&quot; for Guilds to announce themselves and become sanctioned
on TSN (and there STILL isn't today) and no message board area to call
your own. It was pretty damn lame (and still is). However, Yserbius was
much cheaper than AOL in those days. He decided to wait for the upgrade
and see if it would disuade him from returning back to Neverwinter.</FONT></FONT></P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P><FONT COLOR="#C0C0C0"><FONT SIZE=+1>It was during this period
of time, KAAOS went from 30 members down to 18, and only half of them were
active. The game was boring them into inactivity. Malhavok knew something
must be done quickly to save his creation, and assured everyone better
times were ahead. The 1st &quot;upgrade&quot; to Yserbius came out amid
little fanfare, and was a major disappointment. Few interface improvements,
no new classes, and worst of all...PVP was BANNED. That was the last straw.
Mal was heading back to Neverwinter.</FONT></FONT></P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P><FONT COLOR="#C0C0C0"><FONT SIZE=+1>Mal announced his intentions
and found many were willing to move KAAOS to Neverwinter, but many who
had staked their claim to Yserbius, were NOT. In a bold move, worthy of
legend, Malhavok usurped the Throne of KAAOS and announced KAAOS would
be moving to Neverwinter. What transpired was a wonderfully bitter battle!
Two divided factions formed. Those siding with Malhavok, and those wanting
to stay in Yserbius. Mal had carefully hand-picked those he would take
to Neverwinter. Of the 19 members, Mal took the 10 most active: Merculus,
Dark Anjel, War Lance, Doomers, Feebinator, and others took the KAAOS war
machine to Neverwinter Nights and set up the Hell Hole.</FONT></FONT>

over Neverwinter Nights - Fucking Wheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!!&quot;</I></FONT></FONT></P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P><FONT COLOR="#C0C0C0"><FONT SIZE=+1>KAAOS started as a non-sanctioned
guild and struggled to make a name for itself in Neverwinter. Malhavok's
reputation from his former presence in NW preceeded him, and he quickly
developed a large following of old time, veteran NWN'ers. A mere 5 months
after applying for non-sanctioned guild acceptance, KAAOS was awarded Sanctioned
Guild of Neverwinter status and was well on it's way into the Neverwinter
history books. While KAAOS thrived in Neverwinter, tales of the remnants
of KAAOS on Yserbius reached Malhavok's ears. A weak and liberal recruitment
process? No more Hell Hole meetings?! No more live evil sayings?!? No more
KAAOS DeathHunts?!?! RULES and LAWS for KAAOS?!? WHAT the hell was going
on!??! Malhavok was not amused. He severed all ties with Yserbius's KAAOS
and thought no more of those who had lost the TRUE spirit of KAAOS.</FONT></FONT></P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P><FONT COLOR="#C0C0C0"><FONT SIZE=+1>Today in Neverwinter, KAAOS
continues kicking ass. In Neverwinter, Player Vs. Player combat is a game
within itself, and requires not only luck and the best equipment, but a
strategy aspect worthy of anyone willing to take the time to learn the
finer points. As in the old days when Doomers, Merculus, Chaosium, War
Lance and Malhavok struck fear into the hearts of Yserbius, the names of
Rellikk, Slayve, Doc Krypto, Stilborn, Mad Drunk, Kal Mirage, Xardak, P1rate
and Hedron do the same to Neverwinter.</FONT></FONT></P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P><FONT COLOR="#C0C0C0"><FONT SIZE=+1>When Neverwinter ran Quests
2 or 3 times a year, the newly formed KAAOS ruled. Taking 2nd place in
their first realms-wide quest, KAAOS went on to dominate the next 4 realms-wide
Quests and take 1st place! KAAOS won every Quest for a year straight. Soon
after KAAOS' stranglehold on these events, realms-wide Quests started becoming
rarer and rarer, down to only 1 a year. (Some say, the constant dominance
of KAAOS caused the powers that be to stop sponsoring Quests altogether.
Hehehe! ;&gt;).</FONT></FONT></P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P><FONT COLOR="#C0C0C0"><FONT SIZE=+1>With Quests no longer occupying
folks' attention, PVP Tournaments soon became all the rage. Now with 4
major PVP ladders, one look at the <A HREF="trophy.htm">Trophy Room of
the Gods</A>, and you'll see the tradition of KAAOS excellence remains
intact as the Gods and Goddesses rule nearly every one. With over *9* PVP
Champions (the most by FAR over any other guild) KAAOS seeks to accept
only the most skilled and dedicated players. Testimony to this, KAAOS recently
won a <A HREF="quads.htm">Neverwinter-wide Guild PVP Championship</A>,
a tournament where 20 other Guilds' teams pitted their PVP prowess against
each other in battles to the death to determine the best. KAAOS not only
won the Championship, but remained *undefeated* throughout the entire tournament!</FONT></FONT></P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P><FONT COLOR="#C0C0C0"><FONT SIZE=+1>Sir Rellikk now leads the
Gods and Goddesses of KAAOS into prosperous existance. Having retired as
GM, Malhavok now dedicates much of his time to insuring the recruitment
process of KAAOS remains intact and the guild's reputation as the &quot;Ultimate
Evil in Neverwinter&quot; remains strong. Tuesday night Hell Hole's are
still a highlight and a tradition, where soul spritzers, troll weed and
the promise of &quot;LIVE EVIL!&quot; bring as many as 20 KAAOS Gods and
10 worshippers (a.k.a. KAAOS wanna-be's), to the private room where KAAOS
holds court. </FONT></FONT></P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P><FONT COLOR="#C0C0C0"><FONT SIZE=+1>Now, Neverwinter is gone...crushed
by corporate America. Rest assured the Gods of KAAOS will continue.&nbsp;&nbsp;Wherever
they decide to next reign, they will go in full force. </FONT></FONT></P></CENTER>
