It should have been the last mistake they ever made.<P>Grubby little Hedron, however, had also decided that it would be funny.  So he sat there as the the fools punched and kicked him.  He absorbed the pain, and felt it as flavored electric shocks that jolted through his body.  Every once in a while a quiet little laugh would escape him during the beating.  Of course, the laugh infuriated them.  One of them pulled out a small club and smashed it across Hedron's knee.<P>This had pulled a hollow belly laugh from Hedron.  It roared out.  And once it was out there, it kept bubbling over.  The two men were driven to greater heights of fury by this, and shoved their "victim" out of his chair and onto the ground, kicking and beating him as he lay there, curled up... still laughing as hard as anyone ever had in their lives.<P>After awhile, they had grown bewildered and vaguely uneasy about this laughing man who refused to feel pain.  They looked at each other for an instant, backed away a bit, and turned and walked out - swaggering with a pretended bravado where none was left - the laughter had drained it right out of them.<P>As they left, Hedron lay there on his side, a small splash of his blood pooling by his face.  His eyes lit up for an instant, and the fingers of his left hand stretched out and grabbed power, beginning to shape it.  But as the forces coalesced, Hedron's concentration shattered again into fragments of laughter.  The simple idea of those two peasants beating The False Prophet in a cheap tavern, and living past it was just too amusing to smash.  So he had let it be.<P><BR>Hedron continued dragging his now useless leg down the street, seeing his way with the one eye that could still see.  It amused him to keep his souvenirs.
