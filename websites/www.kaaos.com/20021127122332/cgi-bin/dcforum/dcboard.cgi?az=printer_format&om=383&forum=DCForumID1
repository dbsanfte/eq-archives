Kal had to say this, "You do realize that you are replying to messages almost a year old?"<P>And do you realize it takes years to be recognized by your KAAOS guild? Talk about anal and retarded in a game coming up that requires numbers over quality. Quality might matter when you have a few thousand years ROFL!!!<P>

Perhaps you should just shuffle on your merry way then.

I don't have a few years to waist my time on a pack of high "quality", short fuse, nose in the air, lost "gods" of the internet! Anyone can be quality players in any game if they spend time gaining exp. Not just a good amount of time but enough time to know the game and its timing. Knowing how much time it takes to put down any monster and how many people are needed. It is all about numbers in Shadowbane by Wolfpack. Wolfpack designed the game to have hundreds of players in one battleground. Why join a guild that has a long waiting list if you can join one in a few days and be on your way to slaughtering the one with a long waiting list. What lovely vengeance indeed! Nobody like to be misjudged.<P>In Ultima it was how you used your time in pvp. Since there can never be more than a few characters on the screen at a time. If you were a fighter, you better have a long range weapon. A mages best friend would be the freeze spell. Now if you have a good reflect item and a hiding item you could win any mage. If I knew a combo was coming all I would do is put that hiding item on. If the item was not found on a monster they can be bought on ebay. It was so much fun using the items instead of waisting a character getting the hiding skill.  <P>Knowing that I can buy my skill with an item just like buying a deadly poisoned katana or getting my newbie sword dped for a price. Why would I want to wait a whole year to join a lifeless guild? It is not real life that is at stake.  You can now get a quality character that can be bought at a price from UO. What has the world come to when pixels cost money?

<BR>Um, and I'm sure a zound of 8 year olds can take on one battalion of marines..   Personally, I'd vote on the marines.<P>  I take it you haven't ready much on the arts of war, or anything dealing with warfare for that matter.  Go back and read some of your history on ANY of the wars/civil war/revolutions.. etc and you'll see that quantity does NOT always overtake quality.  <P>  But I guess we're talking about gaming..  hmm.  Nope, still going with the what was previous said.<P>Heh Heh, you silly fuck-nut.  <P>Warr Pride.<BR>WAR out!<BR>

Are we still discussing games? War and games are two different subjects. A young person could still beat an older person in chess. Just because you are big or have a lot of strength doesn’t mean you can kill a mage for example. The art of war could not be used while playing most games. Shadowbane might change that since land can be conquered and loot will be 100 times better. Leaders are more important than before since they will do a lot more than gather up players or ban them if they do a bad job. They have to hire some guards much like UO factions and they have to gather up resources to build. In the UO factions there were only three or four faction guards. This game could have no limit on the amount of guards if your guild has many members. With many members you can have much more gold. With many members you can attack any castle you want. And get even more gold. With more members you can hold an election and have a good leader, and so on. The KAAOS guild might have a tougher time even with god like tactics since the entire guild will be made up of a group of homeless members. Instead of KAAOS let’s call them Kids at an Orphan Society? Just a thought.
