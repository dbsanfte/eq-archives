The marketplace was crowded.  That color-filled, scent-filled, noise-filled, motion-filled crowded that pours itself into every marketplace worthy of the name.

Hedron sat in the very center of the place, spread out on the ground, with his bad leg straight out in front of him.  And he begged.

After looking in the mirror and seeing his swollen eye, and his limp, and the listless expression on his face, The False Prophet had decided that he looked like nothing so much as a beggar.  So he begged - with a smile, and a nod of the head for anyone who tossed some copper his way.  And he still laughed quietly to himself.

Hedron did not understand anything about what he'd been doing for the past week.  Not the crashing darkness, not the shattering, not the beatings, not the begging, not the laughter, not the mercy.  None of it made sense to him.  But he wasn't searching for the sense in it.

It was like a wound that itched with some infection, and he was scratching it by taking a knife and scraping it over the raw flesh, biting down with it and cutting the wound deeper.  Eventually, he'd reach bone.  He knew that.  It didn't matter.

Clink into his cup.
Smile.  Nod.
Click into his cup.
Smile.  Nod.
Scowls and spitting.
Smile. Nod.

Somewhere in a remote corner of his mind, something sang.  A low, frothy song that caressed as it rolled on.  It was the Twisted Cross, humming and singing to him from the oblivion where he'd left it.  It soothed him, although its instruments were the low moans of mindless unhappiness and pain - the residue left by the eaten souls of millions.

So far he'd managed to collect 38 copper.  Every so often he counted them, from first to last.

36, 37, 38,
Clink into his cup.
Smile. Nod.
39.

Hedron

...No child, don't cry.  Your tears only boil away on the Twisted Cross.  It's your blood that soaks in deep.  Your blood...
