<FONT SIZE=3D2 Color = #ef0000><P>KAAOS - The god damn pit. The center of hell.
 The evil boiling in the hidden chamber of the heart that doesn't show up in
 any x-ray.</P>
<P>KAAOS is a seething pot of blood. Gods and Goddesses are dropped into it
 on a fucking thread that breaks as they hit the surface. You fucking sink
 or swim, bitch. Sink or fucking swim.</P>
<P>What's that mean? GOD DAMMIT! It means if you want to be a god you better
 not buckle. I mean you better not fucking buckle. Not to anyone in the
 realms. If someone is in your face, you're in his. No, let me clarify. If
 someone is in your face, you rip your face off and pour blood all over his
 body before you decimate him like a balloon full of shit blasted apart by
 ten tons of KAAOS Salsa pumped out in a ten ton Godload.</P>

<P>But what if another KAAOSER is in your face?  Walk careful.  Because
 you're sitting across from somebody who's about to rip off their own face,
 and KAAOS has the kind of skull you don't wanna see.</P>

<P>But what the fuck, man? We're a guild. Aren't we supposed to be nice to
 each other? FUCK NO! We hack and slash at each other as much as at anyone
 else. But the new gods... if you drench the new gods in blood and cut them
 open, then all you're left with is a sagging empty balloon of human
 skin.</P>

<P>That's ok. This is KAAOS. That's what we specialize in. As you elder gods
 sit across from those struggling to rise to godhood you slice them apart. 
 You're feeling the evil course through your veins. FUCK YEAH!</P>

<P>But ask yourselves as you raise that knife to slice the skin off that
 bullshit pissant newbie god, "If this one doesn't bleed... if it doesn't
 bleed a drop, but instead raises its own knife to strike me", what
 then?</P>

<P>Like tigers, you gang of fucking rapists, we eat our young. We smash them
 in our teeth and pick them out later. But I'll tell you.  When I lift a
 child god into the air and tear a pound of flesh from the naked child-god's
 back, I watch it. And when I see it stand, shake off the pain, and tear an
 ounce of flesh out of my leg, THAT, gods and godesses, is a fucking GOD
 ready to be discovered. I kick it to the side and leave to blossom into
 pure evil.</P>

<P>That child god is one I want to see grow up and tear a pound of flesh out
 of HIS children. The ones that mew like kittens and roll away to slowly
 bleed and pout are the ones I smash beneath my boot.  They can get the fuck
 out.</P>

<P>Posting finese comes as long as the underlying talent for evil is there.
 PvP finese comes as long as the underlying talent for evil is there. What
 NEVER shows later is the heart of evil, the cunning of death, and the pulse
 of a god. If a child god has all these, then it will grow into a true god
 in all ways.</P>

<P>They true ones come to us like a moth to a flame. They knew where the
 real evil was. They knew where they could tear the skin off their brethren,
 crack his bones like twigs, and have that mother fucker enjoy it. But the
 question is, were they born to it? Will they revel in the blood and gore,
 or only play at evil for a time? The real ones... the ones born to it, they
 are few and far between. Take them as they are, hurt them and torture them,
 but let them live. One day they too shall be gods.</P>

<P>Fucking Worship That!</P>

<P>We are KAAOS.</P>

<P>FUCKING WHEEEEE!</P>
