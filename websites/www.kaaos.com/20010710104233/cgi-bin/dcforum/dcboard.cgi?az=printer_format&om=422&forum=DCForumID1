<blockquote>My Friend,<P>When you are sad, ...I will  get you drunk and help you plot revenge<BR>against the sorry  bastard who made you sad.<P>When you are blue, ...I'll try to dislodge Whatever is choking you.<P>When you smile, ...I'll know  you finally got laid.<P>When you are scared, ...I  will rag you about it every chance I get.<P>When you are worried, ...I will tell you horrible stories about<BR>how much worse it could be, and to quit whining.<P>When you are confused, ...I will use  little words to explain<BR>it to your dumb ass.<P>When you are sick, ...stay  away from me until you're well again.<BR>I don't want whatever  you have.<P>When you fall, ...I will point and laugh  at your clumsy ass.<P>This is my oath, ...I pledge  till the end. Why you may ask?<P>Because you're my  friend!</blockquote><hr><b><font size=2>Table of contents</font></b><hr>
