         Standing at the entrancce to the tavern, I witness Laposn's childish disply and chuckle. I had heard that the gods were being rougher on would be recruits than usual. Based on Lap's reactions, that much had been confirmed.  He didnt even notice me as he walked out, he was so disoriented.<P>Reaching into the brewmasters' bag of tricks, I pull out 2 of Thorn's Triple I Supreme minikegs (one of which has what appears to be a Neverwinter issue MECH power supply) and catch up with the poor sod. "it appears to me that you've had a rough day", I muse as I hand him the now-tapped minikeg (akin to putting a straw in a can of soda.. a typical keg-tap wouldn't have been practical), "this should take a bit of the edge off what troubles you, some of the finest ale in any realm.".<P>As Laposn turns away, I press a button on the power supply on the second minikeg, starting its overload sequence. with the care more common in a master thief , I slide the now enabled minikeg MECH grenade into the hood of his cloak and head back to the tavern, where Hedron and a clutch of the recruits who hadn't broken were about to give chase..<P>"no need to worry about the reject Hedron, he's been taken care of... watch."  Lap hadn't gotten too far, still in sight of the tavern entrance as the MECH grenade reached critical mass and exploded, rending Laposn into an assortment of charred pieces. Several of the larger pieces splattered off the wall of the tavern, while Lap's head landed at the feet of the False Prophet. "while im sure you would've relished the opportunity to torture him, it was far more than he deserved. I'm sure there's a place in the reject hall of shame to put this fool's head."<P>Titokhan<P><P>
