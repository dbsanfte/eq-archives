I won't point out that the fight ended with Fangol.. being 5 levels higher.. having 90 hps left...   A loss is a loss.  I chose to duel being lessor in levels..  was my fault and I lost.   Now..  lets not leave out that the week later..  when I saw Fangol in Lake of Ill Omen and was equal in level..  and chanlleged him again..  he wouldn't accept..  he was "Too busy."<P>My EQ PVP history...  (would list my PVP history in general.. but that is a 10 year span,  I was in KAAOS from day one, and would take a long time)<P>I played with the guild on Rallos Zek,  Which if I am not mistaken..  is a PVP server..  not a blue one as you claim.  When KAAOS left as a whole..  I moved to TZ and played with friends.  I played many a level of characters, my last being a lvl 60 warrior named Croazil in the Guild Pandemonium.  <P>We are still to this day the only guild to Kill CT 3.0 or 2.0 on Tallon.  We have farmed Temple of Veeshan and was in Full Warlords Armor from Kael..   I was #1 on the Tallon PVP ladder (even tho it was in short existance)<P>Guilds would form Raiding partys to come hunt me down.   <P><BR>Follow this Link..  and post a single question..<BR><a href="http://pub43.ezboard.com/ftallonzektimes4735generaldiscussion" target="_blank">http://pub43.ezboard.com/ftallonzektimes4735generaldiscussion</a><P>"Anyone heard of Croazil"<P>You will come to find out that again, you are misinformed and that there was no PVP on Tallon post 50 Without Pandemonium and a few select other guilds that we fought.<P><P>What server did you play on?  What is the url of the community board there so that I can pose the same challenge to you..<P>"Who the fuck is Lord Gayblade?"<P>What?..  You haven't played any games??  Your in a vapor guild whose first game is EQ on Sullon?<P>Ahhh. that's right.. I gave you too much benifit of the doubt..<P>But..  there is no doubt any longer..<P><BR>You, my boy,..  are a putz.<P><BR>Open challenge to ANY TCE..  Find me in game.. enter my zone..
