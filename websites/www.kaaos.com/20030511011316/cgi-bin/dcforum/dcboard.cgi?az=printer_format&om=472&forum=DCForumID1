<blockquote>Check it:<P>Many SB fans are wondering when Shadowbane will start its Closed Beta, so I'll leave a more formal announcement for another time.<P>While a lot of our development effort has gone according to plans, there have been a few problems that are taking longer than anticipated.<BR>In a project this large and complex, that shouldn't be too surprising. Obviously, it's in Ubi Soft's best interest to get Shadowbane into beta as soon as possible. That being said, remember that beta programs are conducted for very tangible, professional reasons. In this case, we need outside testers in the world so we can stress the infrastructure and tune the game systems. If we aren't ready to conduct those tests properly, it would be a waste of your time and ours to start a beta phase. <P>Our network infrastructure is all in place and intense testing is taking place as we speak... The *moment* the last big show-stoppers are fixed, we'll start Beta. The NDA's are ready to go, the envelopes are all addressed, the CDs are waiting to be burned, Wolfpack is eager to see some real players in their world, and the servers are awaiting the first of you to log on.<P>You all know the wrath other MMOs have faced due to problematic launches, and we're determined to make the unveiling of closed beta as smooth as possible. We're just as eager to get into the world and play as you are, but we will not compromise our commitment to quality in order to grab some quick PR. <P>In the future, we will strive to keep you better informed of our schedule and all the latest news.<P><P>Kurtis 'Zelnik' Buckmaster<BR>Director of Community Development<BR>www.ubi.com<BR>www.Shadowbane.com<P>Wow, it may actually be time to bring the kaaos wolves home from the various worlds in which they are currently feasting...And I don't want to hear shit about my positive outlook on this one.  This is right from the horse's mouth (again).  <img src="http://www.kaaos.com/htdocs/dcforum/Images/wink.gif"><P>Rit<P></blockquote><hr><b><font size=2>Table of contents</font></b><hr>

Bah, it's all fucking speculation, but at least there have been two 'official' posts over the past bit of time suggesting that the window is now<BR>weeks, and not months, years, or eons.<P>None of you bastards are going to sour my proactive outlook that is maybe somewhat affected by holiday spirit, but fuck it. I am biting this time.  It's the second and *last* time I will let myself feel even an iota of optimism, and believe the WP/Ubi spin.  Hey, I will be more than happy to play wolfenstein until an appropriate mmorpg<BR>comes into play, but for now call me gullible.<P>Rit<P>

First of all, there is no “Holiday Spirit” in KAAOS unless you count me slitting your throat, shoving my boot up your ass, and using your worthless carcass as a boot slipper, holiday spirit. Ho Ho Ho mother fucker.<P>Secondly, what the hell are you flapping your gums about in such an excited fashion? What was one of the questions we asked of Wolfpack way back?....about, oh 2 years ago? 3 years ago? What is it now anyway?.....That’s right....When does Beta start?...1 week? 1 month? 1 year?...They said then exactly what all that bullshit Zelnik just spouted boils down to, and that is, “it will start when it starts”. What exactly does that mean? It means that the toilet paper I used this morning, which is hanging in a golden frame upon my wall at this very moment, is 10x more interesting and 10x more profound than if Zelnik had said what he just said 10x fast. <P>Do you get it? Zelnik just shoved a dildo up your ass and you said “mmmm, just like the real thing baby”. You pathetic sack of shit, go fuck off in a forum that cares. <P>I’ve been listening to it for so long that they should hire me as their “director of community development”. I could say the exact same thing as Zelnik but with a lot less effort watch:<P>Greetings SB fans and fannets!<P>Many of you are wondering when Shadowbane will start its’ closed Beta. While a lot of our development effort has gone according to blah blah blah, there have been blah blah. In a project this large and complex blah blah....obviously, it’s in our best blah...That being said, remember blah blah blah.....Our network infrastructure is all in place and blah blah...We will start Beta as soon as all the blah blahs are worked out.

Well said Az, well said. You really made your point with that large vomitous mass of nothing that you call a post. I'm surprised you took the time for such a looong (albeit eloquent) reply.<P>If I didn't know any better I would think you are fronting on me- but Az fucking front on me? I can't believe it, uh uh, nope.<BR>                                               You know I have been waiting as long as you have, so big fucking deal. Tell you what, I'll bet you right now that p3 starts before the new year. I'm willing to put my money where my mouth is, are you?<P>Your post puts me in an awkward position, so consider this an abridged, more sanitary version of what you know would be my normal reply. <P><P><BR>

Lol ya I can just see Az as the community relations director for WP/UBI.

Ah, poor Azmo, no holiday spirit?<P>You don't enjoy the fat man in red sneaking into the houses of hapless victims, dropping off whatever items he wishes, whether it be bowls of vomit, or a skull for you to fuck.<P>Oh, I get excited every year as I prepare for the fat man. I pour out a glass of milk and leave it sitting out for days, just watching it turn into lumps. He is obligated to drink it after all.<P>I then go to sleep, waiting for my presents this year. Hoping that I've been good enough to get what I have asked for.<P>This year I asked for a pile of decaying dark-elf flesh, I wish to create a new cloak out of it. I hope I've been good enough this year to get it.<P>Of course, if he doesn't give me what I want, I'll just go back to the battle field where I slayed those elves, and get the flesh for myself.<P>But the wait will still be enjoyable, either way.<P>Same goes for Shadowbane.<P>Mortarion<BR><i>The god of death and decay</i>
