                As darkness began to fall over the realms, with it, the sounds 
                of the creatures of the night began to grow louder. The sounds 
                of men hunting the dangerous creatures and beasts, the sounds 
                of the these beasts hunting the men, the sounds of battle, the 
                sounds of pain, the sounds of bloodshed, and most importantly, 
                the sounds of evil deeds in progress. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Amongst these 
                sounds, one other distinct and unmistakable sound could be heard.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> The sound 
                of KAAOS.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> Their group, 
                consisting of seven Gods and one Goddess, was on the prowl. Whereever 
                they went, death followed close behind. A trail of bloody footprints 
                could be seen marking the soft earth of the Neverwinter Woods 
                as the group moved away from the scene of another of their merciless 
                slaughters.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> As they 
                moved away from the carnage, everyone turned to glance back at 
                their work one last time.. a pile of six mutilated corpses.. two 
                of them charred beyond recognition, and one no more than a pile 
                of bones and ashes. Puddles of blood pooled on the ground around 
                the bodies and all around, rocks and trees were spotted with the 
                crimson red droplets of these unfortunate travellers. One of the 
                corpses clothes seemed to be missing also, the result of some 
                perverted act also.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> The group 
                of KAAOSers began moving on, but for some reason, Slayve was eyeing 
                War Knight and his face was twisted into a demonic looking sneer. 
                The two had a few words and then Slayve pushed War Knight away 
                and they began heading back to the KAAOS Hell Hole.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
                </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Once back 
                at the Hell Hole, everyone began bragging about their take of 
                Souls for the evening. The Dreadlord was fiddling with his serrated 
                dagger and slashing across the air, reenacting a morbid scene 
                in front of the kneeling slaves, ITB Legion and ITB Silver.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> In the middle 
                of the large hall, though, War Knight and Slayve were pushing 
                each other again. They were yelling back and forth about who had 
                rights to the soul of one of the wusses they had killed. As the 
                pushes became shoves, the rest of the room began to break up into 
                two factions around the two bickering Gods.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> Kal Mirage, 
                Ego Prime and Xylina all moved behind War Knight, while Sir Rellik, 
                Tyo Ark and Krynal gather behind Slayve. Then everyone began yelling 
                back and forth at everyone else soon enough everyone was pushing 
                everyone. Just as it seemed as if it was about to come to some 
                nice honest fighting to settle the dispute, War Knight raised 
                his hand and spoke in his loud booming voice, "There is only one 
                way to settle this.."</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> Turning, 
                he pointed to the corner where a large keg of his finest ale sat. 
                Everyone traded looks of confusion until War threw a large mug 
                at Slayve. The demon God snatched the mug out of the air and pushed 
                his way through the mass of KAAOSers, but instead of tapping the 
                keg, he just looked at his mug.. and it filled with a dark murky 
                liquid with tendril of smoke rising off of it. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Everyone 
                began to understand and they all fetched different liquids and 
                substances, mugs, shot glasses, and the like. Within seconds, 
                shots were being downed, new kegs were being tapped, people were 
                yelling back and forth and slamming their mugs down as they called 
                for the slaves to bring them more.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> ITB Legion 
                hurriedly supplied the Dreadlord's team with more drinks, while 
                ITB Silver ran back and forth trying to keep all of Kal's team's 
                glasses full. Insults were being thrown every which way, along 
                with empty mugs and other containers. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Then the 
                first casualties began to occurr. Xylina threw down three more 
                shots of a red, glowing liquid, but then she started to fall back 
                in her chair. The sound of Sir Rellik laughing at her, "Heh! Heh!," 
                brought her back to her senses long enough for her to shoot him 
                an icy stare and hurl all three shot glasses, in succession, at 
                the Dreadlord's head. One after another, all three hit Rellik 
                right in between the eyes. Then in unison, the both of them fell 
                to the floor, slipping under the table.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> Next to 
                go was Tyo Ark. After having downed another mug of War's ale, 
                he leaned back in his chair, two feet off the ground, then he 
                belched. The walls shook with the might of his expulsion of the 
                gaseous bubble in his stomach. The force of the vibrations caused 
                his chair to rock back and his head slammed against the stone 
                floor. His eyes rolled back into his head and blood started pooring 
                from his nose.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> Followed 
                by the vibrations of his belch, was a hideous odor. Everyone else's 
                noses furrowed and tehy shook it off. All except War Knight, who 
                was holding a large keg of ale of his head and chugging it. The 
                foul odor caused his knees to buckle and he fell to the floor. 
                The keg slipped from his hands and came crashing down right on 
                his head, then he flopped to the floor with a thump, his head 
                buried inside the keg.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> Slayve started 
                to smirk and called Ego over for a moment. Ego wondered what was 
                going on but followed anyways. Then Slayve bent over and another 
                loud noise rocked the Hell Hole, followed by an even fouler odor. 
                Kal and Krynal dove under the tables to stay out of the direct 
                path of the very deadly cloud of gas that had been created. Ego 
                Prime couldnt escape though. He inhaled deeply and the fell face 
                first to the ground, landing right on top of ITB Silver. Ego pinned 
                her to the ground and held her there as he slipped into consciousness.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> Slayve, 
                however, let out another loud sound, however this time it was 
                more than just gas. With a pained look on his face, he ran from 
                the room, howling and swearing in some sort of harsh demonic tongue. 
                As the air cleared and the smell disipated, only Kal Mirage and 
                Krynal remained. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Both of these 
                two gods kept slammed down mugs of ale and shots of powerful soulspritzers. 
                Many times it looked as if Kal was about to fall back in his chair, 
                but he kept holding his own against Krynal. Then when it seemed 
                like neither of them would ever succumb to the liquor, Krynal 
                started to cough and sputter, then ducked his head under the table.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> Kal Mirage 
                slammed down one last drink as Krynal continued to puke and vomit 
                all over the Hell Hole floor. When the sounds of his puking stopped, 
                he just collapsed under the table. Kal then stood up and raised 
                his mug, proclaiming their victory to his fallen comrades. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">He then walked 
                over and lifted his passed out wife into his arms, then grabbed 
                a bottle of some blue liquid and headed off into the slightly
