         <i>The flow of combat is extremely important, too slow (like chess) is boring for almost any modern day gamer. I suck at chess, but I'm sure that even I could push a grand master to 20 moves if I played it defensively enough.</i><P>A game is boring if the game is boring, not how long a fight takes. Most modern day RPG's take mere seconds to complete a fight, all modern day RPG's are boring to me. Speed does not = good PvP. <P>I had no problem with the pace of NWN PvP but compared to today's games, a PvP match in NWN took an eternity. NWN, for example, took anywhere from a couple minutes to a few hours to complete a fight. When I fought most any non&#8209;tournament fighter in NWN I'd have them dead in 11 rounds or less. Usually less but 11 rounds was about as long as most un-notable PvPers could last against me. That's 7 minutes max putting the average at abound 3 &#8209; 5 minutes. To me this was very quick, plenty quick. It gave enough time for everyone to get their hands dirty and do some thinking. Alternatively, most matches against notable PvPers would last 30  minutes. I've had several that lasted an hour  and one (against Kal) that lasted two and a half hours. You’d think 4 on 4's would take even longer but this wasn’t really the case. Our quad team only ever had 1 match go as far as 18 rounds (which took around 30 - 45 minutes or so). The next longest match we had took 11 rounds (around 20 minutes). Is all of that too long for today’s gamers? Probably but who cares, today’s gamers have no idea what PvP is anyway. This pretty much coincides with your second paragraph but I wanted to elaborate on my GM chess comment. I don’t really have a time frame preference, I just think that combat should get a chance to flesh out. <P><i> I'm with you when you say that healing slows the combat down too much. I don't mind seeing a heal or two in combat (especially group combat), but damaging for 100 hp, then healing for 200 hp is a problem. Heals should be used as a counter against someone who is trying to chip away at your HP. There is no way that heals should be a reasonable counter to someone who's going full out damage.</i> <P>Healing only “slows combat down too much” when it is not balanced properly. Healing is a counter tactic but as I said, it’s not a good counter tactic (poor game design) if it is the ONLY counter tactic or if it’s not balanced properly. PvP is very much about resources. When those resources are not balanced properly you end up with a piss poor PvP design. Health needs to be in line with damage output/resource expenditure. Games that are designed for a certain class to have 1000 health while another class has in excess of 3 or 4k, for example, are simply working off a recipe for failure. It’s not the numbers, hell you could have 500000000 health, it’s the spread. Shadowbane, for example, has too great of a spread on just about everything from health to stats to armor rating to attack rating. It’s damn near impossible, which SB has basically proven, to balance too great of a spread. Additionally, casting and melee systems need to be put on the same page as far as resources. Damage, whatever be the source, needs to have similar costs. Any counters need to take into consideration this cost. This is why healing is so fucked up in most games, nobody balances the cost. In NWN, for example, healing was precisely in line with damage. You had a cost (it took up a spell slot, you want to heal you have to give up a spell slot which means you can produce less damage). A heal spell of a particular level was exactly in line with the damage counter part of that level. If you mem’d all heal spells you would not have enough damage output to finish someone. There were items in NWN that had healing charges and they gimped the fuck out of PvP which is why they weren’t allowed in tournament PvP. They fucked up the resource balance.<P><i>Luck sucks. Period. If you had no luck involved, I'd be happy. If you had just a small amount of luck, I'd be happy. When the entire game comes down to lucky rolls, I won't be happy. Use small ranges of numbers when determining to&#8209;hit and damage. That keeps things a little bit interesting and forces people to adjust to that unlucky roll.</i><P>I agree with you that too much luck is gay but some luck makes things interesting. In NWN I used to bitch and moan about luck. If luck wasn’t involved I felt I’d never lose to anyone. This may or may not have been true, I’m not here to argue that, but the fact is, once I hit my prime I lost around 10% of all my fights in NWN and I would have attributed at least 9% of that to luck. In the hundreds of fights I had I can count on 1 hand the number of fights I had where I was just flat out out-classed in that particular fight. One day, during one of my tirades about “luck” Hedron told me “if there was no luck, and you never lost, you would be bored off your ass, this way there is always a chance you could lose”. You know what? He was right. Many of the tactics I used were to mitigate the luck factor. I would avoid fighting in locations that would turn out to be a slugfest because they put the most strain on your saves. I used Mirror Image more than most and I had several “fake” tactics just so I could keep my images up. I faked like a mother fucker. I did whatever I had to do to keep my images up, hell I was known to dispel my own globe if I felt the pressure of no image. Nobody dispelled themselves. Fuck, I even faked dispelling myself from time to time which could only be pulled off because certain people knew I was about the only crazy fuck around that would actually do it for real. All that shit was to keep people from casting certain spells or doing certain actions that would put me at greater risk of lady luck fucking me up the ass with a strap on. The presence of luck not only made the fights have more flavor because of the risk of losing but also it added to the strategic and tactical depth of combat. <P>Basically a little luck can be a good thing when all else is equal. But NWN had a very tight scope of variables (as far as gear/stats/etc), when you have stats and gear that vary widely in scope and play a big role in combat effectiveness you’ve already got a piece of shit PvP system. Talking about luck is a waste of time, that’s the least of your concerns. <P> <BR><i>Combat in a new Scene <P>NWN used this to good effect. NWN was a realtime game when it came to movement. However, NWN movement was done in what could be called a maze with defined squares. Each square had its own new scene that would pop up if combat was started on it. It becomes a lot different when you have a more open game without defined squares, which is pretty much required of games these days. I don't believe this would work very well.</i> <P>NWN didn’t really have a new scene that would pop up, as in it wasn’t a different map on each square. NWN combat scene was basically a blow up of the out-of-combat map.Yes, there were certain nuances to certain locations that would be different than a location a few squares away but basically the idea was it was a blow up of the area you were in, in an overhead view rather than first person. Something similar to this could be integrated. However, defining a turn-based fight in a real-time area be a little difficult. Though I think it can be done with something similar to what “The Realm” uses (or used to use, haven’t seen that game since like ‘96 or some shit). The Realm had a gay ass cloud in an area which symbolized a fight. I’m not saying there would be a cloud with arms and legs flying out or some gay shit but there could be a beacon. Perhaps others’ passing by could pull up a display which listed the people in the fight and perhaps gave options to join the fight or to watch the fight. As far as re-enterers, the fight beacon would stay until the fight is over, ending a fight would require certain parameters. As long as the beacon of a fight is there it keeps a list of people who were in the fight at some point, they could not re-enter that beacon. I’m obviously making this shit up as I go here so I hadn’t worked out any details for a particular system like this. <P><BR><i>Declared Combat <P>This is one of my old ideas. Basically, to start combat you declare combat on an opponent (usually done by starting an offensive attack on him). Combat is done on the map like normal, except in turn&#8209;based. The only way that other people get sucked in is if either they declare combat on someone in the combat or if someone in the combat declares combat on them.</i> <P>Hmm, I’d have to see it in action but it sounds like it would be a little strange having real-time people standing next to turn-based people. I could see some potential problems (especially with AE’s, healing, positioning, movement, and a few other things). But hell, I’m not opposed to anything, until I see it in action. I do know that a separate screen can solve many problems with integration of real-time (out of combat) and turn-based combat. <P><i>True turn based <P>It usually gives a slightly unfair advantage to whoever goes first because whoever goes 2nd will have to adjust to whatever was done before he even had a chance to do anything.</i><P>I don’t agree that this is an inherent problem with turn-based. Initiative is a serious problem in real-time (most real-time games, whoever initiates has a fucking huge advantage) but not so much so in turn-based. In NWN, for example, because of the presence of NPC’s, going first was not always an advantage. In some spots it was a down right disadvantage.<P><i>Don't bother. Azmo is right on that one.</i> <P>Azmo is right on every one, Azmo is always right ;p<P>Azmodion<BR>KAAOS
