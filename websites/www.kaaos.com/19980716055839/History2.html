<P>  
  Time passed on TSOY and KAAOS grew. PVP skill, and getting the best weapons were the main ways to
 show guild dominance in those days. KAAOS had plenty of both (as usual ;>). Members came and went as
 they pleased, and achieved all in the name of KAAOS. Tuesday night Hell Hole meetings were loads of fun
    and KAAOS was active. The infamous "Say something Evil!" initiation process insured only the truly
 worthy were accepted into the ranks of KAAOS. Other guilds formed...Aegis, TheMercs, the Bhall's, KOY
  (TSOY's version of COR), and others all took up residence in Yserbius and one year of battles, bragging,
                adventuring and rp fun passed quickly. The entity known as KAAOS thrived.
</P>
<p>
 But soon, after only 1 year, many grew tired of Yserbius' limited gameplay and poor interface. An upgrade
  appeared on the horizon, but Malhavok longed for the better combat/PVP engine and superior quality of
    AOL's Neverwinter Nights. There was no real "area" for Guilds to announce themselves and become
 sanctioned on TSN (and there STILL isn't today) and no message board area to call your own. It was pretty
 damn lame (and still is). However, Yserbius was much cheaper than AOL in those days. He decided to wait
            for the upgrade and see if it would disuade him from returning back to Neverwinter.
</P>
<P>
 It was during this period of time, KAAOS went from 30 members down to 18, and only half of them were
 active. The game was boring them into inactivity. Malhavok knew something must be done quickly to save
 his creation, and assured everyone better times were ahead. The 1st "upgrade" to Yserbius came out amid
 little fanfare, and was a major disappointment. Few interface improvements, no new classes, and worst of
          all...PVP was BANNED. That was the last straw. Mal was heading back to Neverwinter.
</P>
<p>
Mal announced his intentions and found many were willing to move KAAOS to Neverwinter, but many who
  had staked their claim to Yserbius, were NOT. In a bold move, worthy of legend, Malhavok usurped the
    Throne of KAAOS and announced KAAOS would be moving to Neverwinter. What transpired was a
 wonderfully bitter battle! Two divided factions formed. Those siding with Malhavok, and those wanting to
 stay in Yserbius. Mal had carefully hand-picked those he would take to Neverwinter. Of the 19 members,
 Mal took the 10 most active: Merculus, Dark Anjel, War Lance, Doomers, Feebinator, and others took the
                  KAAOS war machine to Neverwinter Nights and set up the Hell Hole.
