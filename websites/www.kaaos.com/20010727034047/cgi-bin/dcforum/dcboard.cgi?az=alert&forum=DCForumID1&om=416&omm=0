Hi, I am interested in gaining audience with your guild, i.e. I want to join KAAOS.

My resume...

1. I am Pit Fiend of HEL (Hell's Elite Legions), guildmaster (1 out of 4). www.HEL-guild.com , we are a gaming guild strictly in 1st person shooter, simulation, and strategy games games.

2. I was ranked #1 deathmatch player in Battlezone and founded HEL in 1997.

3. HEL currently plays in:
----Battlezone, formerly, undefeated #1 ranking, we OwNeD... most of our players have moved on
----Battlezone2, currently ranked #1 in strategy play, undefeated, developers of the "HEL rush", active
----Soldier of Fortune, currently ranked #1 in team deathmatch, undefeated, very active
----Mechwarrior 4, unranked, 31 wins 0 losses, played every guild out there outside of tournaments. very active
----Crimson Skies, took the #2 spot in last tourney, we have the #1, #4, and #5 guys in worldwide rankings in CS, very active
----Tribes 2, just started, making a large impact
----Counterstrike, dont know how we are doing, im not involved at all in that division
----Echelon, just started, some players have high rankings as of a few days of play, we'll see how things go...
----Jumpgate, just started, i dont even know what the game is about
----Some other games i cant even remember...

4. We have over 150 members, but they are spread out among many games so there's only a few "Elite" players per game...

5. We have a very high retension rate among players

6. I dont whine, ever.  If I get owned, I adapt and I squash.

7. I have NO PvP experience in MMORPG, I am a newbie,  But I have the burning desire excel and have proven the potential to achieve it.

Why KAAOS?
You guys have big egos and a unique way with words, in my book thats ok b-cause you can back yer shit up with real gameplay.  I play to "win" however that is defined in any game, the true definition of "fun" to a Pit Fiend.

We share many social qualities, your guild and mine are "elite", our members have the freedom to flame someone and back it up on da field of battle, and we both have many enemies... what do people expect from a bunch of guys calling themselves KAAOS or HEL anyway, a dozen roses?

Im tired of leading, I want to PLAY, I will squash, I will follow greatness into battle, its a 2-way street guys...

HEL has no intention of entering any MMORP game.

Btw, I tried to enter my resume under your "join" menu, but when I typed out a message it didnt show any words, thats why i posted here....
