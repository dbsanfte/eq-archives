Thread Subject: Playing AC/Darktide was probably the most fun I ever had...

----------------------------------------------------
In the begining, I had some of the most fun in my life playing Darktide... It seems to have lost its enchantment though... With the "uberguilds", whorechains, dishonesty, hacks, and glitches...  I think the duping glitch was the last straw.

Sadly, I must say that AC is on its last leg and is almost dead.  However, the people at Turbine definitely had very very good ideas and dreams for Asheron's Call, and I think we will see that in AC2.

Asheron's Call has to be the most dynamic real-time "Quake-like" PvP game ever made.  You can dodge spells, arrows, outrun people with your runskill, jump over spells, jump over walls, and many many other things, which is DAMN impressive considering that it is a pretty old game, I believe UO, EQ and AC were the first three big players out there, and I must say that when it comes to PvP, Action, and replayability, AC definitely takes the crown.

Unfortunately, I think its time has passed... I know the AC dev team has been going through hell with duping glitches (Anyone else notice that the *best* games are always the ones with duping bugs! eek!).  The first duping glitch they did a good job on fixing... the fix was out before hardly anyone knew about it, I believe I was one of maybe ten that knew about it, and I reported it to them.  The second duping bug took longer to fix, and remained in the game for quite some time, however it was difficult to do (it required crashing the server clusters), so it was not too serious.  The third duping glitch, however, grew completely out of control... I hear now that some of the most prized items now that used to go for hundreds of dollars on ebay are now as common as dirt...

Its sad that things like that can ruin a game, and that people are so shallow to cheat and ruin a game like that, but it does happen.  I keep my hopes high for AC2 though -- Turbine definitely has an incredible dev team and good ideas... With all of the new tech, and a more deep involved story line, I believe it will become the best MMO out there...  I know its on my *dr00l* list :)
