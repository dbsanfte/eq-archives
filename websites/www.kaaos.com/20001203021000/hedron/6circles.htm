<H1>The Six Circles of the Adept Game Player</H1>

<H1><IMG SRC="sword.jpg" HEIGHT=286 WIDTH=400 ALIGN=RIGHT></H1>

<H2>What's My Point</H2>

<UL>
<P>I've been thinking about writing this document for some time, but never
seemed to get around to it. I&nbsp;have been watching the recent exodus
of experienced players from the game, however, and it has really spurred
the urge for me to put this together to possibly stop the good players
from leaving.</P>

<P>There's definitely a large number of problems with Ultima Online. That's
clear. But for as many disappointments as the bugs cause, I&nbsp;see more
people walking away disgusted because of their interaction with other players.
What strikes me about this is that the people involved just don't see the
whole cycle. They don't understand how and why the players play the way
they do, and because of that they don't see how the current behavior of
most of the UO players can ever lead to the kind of gaming experience they're
looking for.</P>

<P>Even beyond that, I think there are a large number of players who don't
understand what the best aspects are of a role playing multi-player game.
I see lots of people playing UO exactly like it's a single player game.
They're exploring the challenges of NPCs and stat building, finishing that
part of the cycle, getting bored, and moving on.</P>

<P>So what I've written is a description of the &quot;Circles&quot; of
game playing. The better you are, the higher your circle.</P>

<P>By doing this I'm hoping to:</P>

<OL>
<LI>Encourage players in the early parts of the cycle to advance through
to the later parts</LI>

<LI>Help the advanced players to clearly understand that there IS&nbsp;a
cycle of game playing, and that beginning players need time to develop
to the point where they can participate at the high level that the advanced
players want to play at. Ultima is a YOUNG&nbsp;game, with young players
(in a game-hours played sense), and because of this it's unavoidable that
until the community for this game matures, the high-level interaction of
the 6th Circle game players is going to be rare.</LI>

<LI>I'm hoping there's an outside chance that OSI, and other MMORGP designers will read this, and pick
up a little insight into the few aspects of gaming that they might not
have already thought of. It's CRUCIAL&nbsp;that game designers understand
that they should be designing the game and all its updates around making
the 5th and 6th circles of play better. ALL&nbsp;aspects of those circles.
Including PVP improvements, chat improvements, better boards, and role
play environments. Maybe they already know this stuff, and just have too
much work to do on the basics to worry about it, but if they don't, then
I'm hoping they read this.</LI>
</OL>

<P>The good news is, if you wait for it, it will come (especially given
OSI's willingness to constantly update the game to make sure the environment
encourages this).</P>

<P>The information below is based on real observations of the cycle of
game play for hundreds of players. It's not something I invented, it's
something I have experienced myself, and watched others experience it.
The observations I'm making come from a long history of playing online
games, and/or participating in online communities. In some way shape or
form, I've been hanging with people online since around 1986, beginning
with pre-internet (or at least pre publicly used, web based internet) local
6 person chat rooms and BBSes, up through services like AOL, through online
games, out onto the internet, etc. Not that I'm particularly interested
in boring you with my &quot;credentials&quot;, but I think it's important
to know that I've seen a lot of this shit, and that I'm not just guessing
about how it works. For over 10 years, one way or another, I've been watching
people interact online. In terms of player interactive games,
I've played Diablo, MageStorm, Doom (I&amp;II), Duke Nuk'em, Quake, War
Craft, War Craft 2, Starcraft, Solaria, Everquest, dabbled in some MUDs and probably most importantly,
a graphical MRPG game called Neverwinter Nights based on AD&amp;D rules that allowed 500
or so players on at once for over 3 years. Offline, I've played D&amp;D,
AD&amp;D, Magic: The Gathering, and off-line computer games.</P>

<P>For whatever it's worth, here's what I've seen. (I've tried to keep
this main document streamlined to provide a relatively quick read on my
main point - the cycle of game maturity. There's a ton of good detail on
each section that I'm not providing here, but my intention is over time
to write more sections, and hyperlink to them from this document. If you
wanna get deep into it, you can follow those, if not, just breeze this
top layer).</P>
</UL>

<H1>Game Maturity</H1>

<P>Most players move through a hierarchy of playing, advancing through
states of maturity as characters and players in the game. I don't mean
maturity in the sense of real world adult sensibilities, I just mean in
terms of fully developed game skills, knowledge, and characters. The point
of writing this up is this: think about where you're at in this cycle,
think about where the people that you're playing with are at in this cycle,
and think about what the over-all effect on the gaming experience will
be in Ultima once enough people have been around long enough to make it
through these stages. </P>

<P>That's the whole key. The highest forms of play are in the upper stages.
The player base has not had time to reach them on a general level, which
means that finding people that are high enough up the circles to play with is
tough.. (Pursuit of the lower circles often leads to what some players
consider &quot;power&quot; playing and that some call &quot;abusive&quot;.)</P>

<P>(Also, worth mentioning is the fact that some of us out there may not
have even tried to go through each of these Circles in Ultima. Players
like me come from other environments where we already did this, so we know
what type of character and play style we like. As a result, we make a b-line
for that niche, without stopping in the other circles. You may recognize
yourself in this category.)</P>

<H2>The First Circle - Survival</H2>

<UL>
<P>When players first start the game, they're newbies. Their main concern
is acquiring enough stats, skills, money, weapons, armor, etc. just to
survive. They want to do things in the game without risking death at every
turn.</P>
</UL>

<H2>The Second Circle - Competence</H2>

<UL>
<P>Once you're starting to get your stuff together, you're less worried
about just staying alive, and more into developing a higher level of competence.
You're rolling through lower-level creatures, and common challenges, beating
them, and gaining momentum. Game play finally starts to feel a little &quot;fun&quot;.</P>
</UL>

<H2>The Third Circle - Beat the Game / Excel</H2>

<UL>
<P>Once you're pretty good, you start getting determined to be &quot;really&quot;
good. You get the best armor, the best magic, the best skills, etc. etc.
If you've got that, usually you start trying to beat the game. You find
the toughest monsters, and baddest dungeons, and take 'em on in a full
charge. Unfortunately, this is also around the time that certain players
start finding and exploiting bugs. As part of the urge to beat the game,
they beat the hell out of it... by cheating.</P>
</UL>

<H2>The Fourth Circle - Prove your Mastery</H2>

<UL>
<P>Ok, so you've got it, the best of everything... so now what? Well, this
is a social game. Multi-player games are all about interacting with other
real people. So if you want to prove how good you are, you've got two choices.
People pick whatever is their style, but almost everybody moves into either</P>

<P>1) Helping others (taking bands adventuring, handing out stuff, teaching
newbies, etc. Note: this is NOT the same thing as Role Play, that's covered
the 5th Circle) or,</P>

<P>2) Killing others (kill everyone, including those who have no chance
at beating you and then taunt them with the fact that you did it. Note:
this is Player Killing, it is NOT the same thing as Player versus Player
which is covered in the next Circle.)</P>
</UL>

<H2>The Fifth Circle - Seek New Challenges</H2>

<UL>
<P>Now here's where it gets interesting. And also dangerous for OSI. There's
a limited number of things to do in a game that can be programmed into
it. It's at this point that people have exhausted them. They need something
new, and there are only a few options left. The point is that no matter
WHAT&nbsp;OSI does, they just can't program an ever-changing environment
that will hold the interest of real people for an indefinite period of
time. It can't be done. It's not possible.</P>

<P>What can be done is to set up an environment in which people amuse themselves.
Once people have used up all the pre-programmed challenges, there's nothing
left but to interact with other people, and that's what most/all of the
Fifth Circle is about. If OSI has designed a game that doesn't support
numbers 1 through 7 (below) very well, then people will head straight for number 8, and
UO&nbsp;will die out.</P>

<P>There are a number of options to turn to in the Fifth Circle, and which
way you turn is a matter of who you are. Depending on your inclination,
you might pick any one of them. When you've fully explored the one you
pick first, if you're like most true gamers, you'll just move on to one
of the others. The longer you've played, the more accepting you are of
ALL&nbsp;of these aspects, because you've tried more and more of them,
and realize and understand the merits of them.</P>

<P>I've tried to list them in the order that most seem to move through
them, but it's fairly likely that the average player will just skip around
to whatever holds their interest. The DEGREE&nbsp;to which you explore
these is also variable. If you're not very strategic, you might just barely
touch PVP, but then get neck-deep into RP, or visa versa. The bottom line,
though is that since all of these items are about interacting with other
people (except MAYBE #1), if you don't have other people to interact with
that are exploring the category you've chosen, then you don't have anything.
That's the problem that UO&nbsp;is suffering from right now. Anyway, here
they are:</P>

<P><B>1) Different classes</B> - roll a new guy, start over, and develop
him differently. Really get to know the nuances of the advantages and disadvantages
of the various character types.</P>

<P><B>2) PVP (player vs. player)</B>- aaahhh! Now here's the real beauty.
Fighting NPCs is a chore, fighting real people (in the right game environment)
is an ART! UO&nbsp;has yet to see ANY&nbsp;of this to my knowledge. All
it has is PK (player killing). Simplistic brainless slug fests with no
technique or talent. This art will develop. The highest form of this is
1 on 1 (in my opinion anyway, although could change my mind yet). And for
those who think that the UO&nbsp;interface precludes this, let me just
say that there are a TON of ideas that have not been explored yet. And
unlike many other games, if there's things that make it suck, just get
'em to change it. Now I agree, bug exploitation for instant kills is a
joke. I'm not talking about that. I'm talking about the ART&nbsp;of PVP.
Nothing in this brief paragraph can describe the full scope of PVP, so
don't underestimate it. And the synergy of player versus player with ALL of
the other circles is the life-blood of a game IMO.</P>

<P><B>3) RP (Role Play)</B> - Playing an actual personality/character, whatever your 
activities are (pk, pvp, guide, helper, whatever) adds a spice and
newness to the game like nothing else. In my opinion, if you combine this
with #2 above, you've reached the pinnacle of game playing.</P>

<P><B>4) Chat Room</B> - as stupid as it sounds (to me anyway), lots of
people get in a game, conquer the basic challenges, make some friends,
and then forget it was ever a game. They just hang out and chat with the
people they've met. I don't condone this, but nonetheless it's the last
stage for a lot of people. However, my own observation is that the chat
interface in UO is pretty bad, so people won't really chat in this game.</P>

<P><B>5) Flame Wars / Board RPs </B>- this is something almost undeveloped
by OSI, but you can't overlook it. Where ever there are boards to be had
in multi-player games, there's a class of people who specialize in just
verbally taking people apart, and/or posting RP and such. When this is
based around actual game events, it becomes very involving. Well worth
participating.  Again, when tied to a STRATEGIC PVP system in which epic 
battles occur whose outcomes are based on the real human skill of the participants, 
then a drama and poignancy to these interactions is added that is not otherwise 
present.</P>

<P><B>6) Intrigue / Events / Guilds</B> - Where ever people go they form
organizations with purposes. Those orgs compete or conflict, and this is
the heart of the political posturing in MPGs. Very cool stuff.</P>

<P><B>7) Occupations</B> - this is a new one in graphical MPGs. It's what
OSI has created by taking a stab at creating a real economy. I'm not sure
how this will work out in the end once things are balanced, but it's definitely
a challenge. Be a merchant, a sailor, a miner for hire, whatever... interesting.</P>

<P><B>8) THE BIG SCARY ONE FOR OSI - GO GET A NEW GAME.</B> People get
bored. Some have the inclination to get involved in the other seven final
challenges, and some don't. A lot of what determines if people stay with
a game is how well the game supports the above 7 items. Programmed challenges
NEVER&nbsp;keep people fascinated. You just can't program an NPC to be
smart enough, funny enough, aggressive enough, cool enough, unpredictable
enough, etc. to hold a real person's attention for any length of time.
Your average player probably breezes through the first 4 circles inside
of 3 to 6 months of play time (depending on how many actual hours they
play). Once that's over, if the game can't support and support WELL real
staying-power playing that the 7 above give, then you might as well stick
a fork in it, it's done.</P>
</UL>

<P><IMG SRC="yinyang.gif" HEIGHT=120 WIDTH=120 ALIGN=RIGHT></P>

<H2>The Sixth Circle - Zen Game Play, Everything is One</H2>

<UL>
<P>This is the final circle of game play. This is the stage at which a
player appreciates all aspects of the Fifth Circle. When you have a world
full of the ultimate players, they combines everything above and create
a challenging, human interacting, role played world with a wide variety
of classes, game play styles, and occupations based around a system of
competition that demands skill, thought, reflex, and strategy to compete
(whether that be in PVP, role play, intrigue, competitive business, whatever).</P>

<P>You can only reach this circle if the conditions are right. First, you
have to be the right type of person. You need to have an attention span,
a desire to interact with others, imagination, a love of challenge, and
a strategic mind. Second, you have to have the right type of game. The
place where you play has to be capable of supporting all of the above elements
in an interface that really allows you to explore them all. The extent
to which it does NOT&nbsp;support them is directly tied to how soon you
basically throw up your arms, conclude that you can never reach the higher
circles in this environment, and boogie looking for that next online game.</P>

<P>When you reach this level, it could be with a varying amount of skill
in any of the 5th circle challenges. Some people specialize in one or two,
and are very light on the others, some are Renaissance people and are well
rounded in them all. The key thing is that you recognize all of them and
their merits, and are able to integrate yourself into the elite class of
characters who play them all without limiting the interaction of any of
them.</P>

<P>That means more than the common attitude of &quot;I play my way, you
play your way, just leave me alone.&quot; RPers need to realize that RPing
in Disney is not what this particular game is about. It's about RPing in
a vicious medieval realm, where death is very real. PKers need to realize
that beyond just slaying the helpless, fighting even battles is where it's
at, and that even beyond that, making someone feel like they're just been
destroyed by an evil lord rampaging across the realms is hugely better
than feeling like they've been destroyed by a 15 year old brat, rampaging
across an environment only slightly more sophisticated than a Nintendo game.</P>

<P>And don't forget, you goodie RPers, PKing isn't just for evils. There's
nothing wrong with killing other players in the name of good. ;&gt;</P>
</UL>

<P>Hopefully this was at least semi-interesting, and more to the point,
I hope it makes a few people think about why things aren't just the way
they like them right now, and points out that given time, there's a good
chance that will change.</P>

<H3>More Thoughts</H3>
<p>Since I have not really gotten around to expanding this document on a comprehensive 
basis to include cohesive articles on other areas, I thought I would at least attach 
some of the various posts that I have saved regarding other areas of game play.  
These posts are the seeds of what will eventually become further articles underneathe
this article.  They're not as well structured and thought-through as the above, so please 
just take them for what they're worth.</p>
