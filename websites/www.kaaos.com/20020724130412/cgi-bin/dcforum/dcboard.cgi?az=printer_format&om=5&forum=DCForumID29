You should be all set Herb. You should be able to see a general discussion folder now. If you don't see it log out and back on. Let me know if you have any problems.

Maybe I dont get it or maybe I'm an idiot but all I see under Sullon Zek conferences is Acess Portal and at the same time it does say at the top I'm logged in under Herb, being that I'm not involved in SB or the rest of your conferences I didnt see why I'd go to those.  If I'm supposed to see another board under SZ Conf. tho I sure dont.<P>Herb

You should see a board called "general discussion" under SZ conferences. <P>Log out and then log back on and reload the boards. These gimp boards won't reload your security settings unless you physically log (rather than auto log from remembered passwords). <P>If you do not see "general discussion" after logging off and logging back on then let me know, I may have done something wrong. I double checked though, you should be good to go.
