That’s what I’ve been saying since NWN, what is wrong with MMORPG’s that is.....Everyone wants to be a super hero. There’s not enough room in a massively multiplayer game for EVERYONE to be the super hero. Of course people don’t buy games and play games to be the same peons they are in real life. They are buying into the “fantasy” on the box. Just like in real life, instead of realizing they are dumb fucks and working to change that they would rather just whine about it. “Whaaaaa whaaaaa whaaaaa, no fair, I want to be the super hero now”.

Developers are in business and that business is to make money, bottom line. They don’t give a rat’s ass about what “you” think is a good game. All they care about is what will entice the most people possible into giving them money. That’s life, that’s the way it is, and you can’t fault them for it. 

There will never be a good PvP game made. NWN was damn good but it was an accident. Now that people are “trying” to incorporate PvP there won’t be anther accident. The percentage of skilled, intelligent, people is very low. It’s human nature for the clue-less, the skill-less, the ambition-less, the brain-less fucks in this world to run away in the face of adversity. This is the same reason why guilds like KAAOS cause other guilds like Darkenbane to fold under pressure. 

Basically, the hopelessly clueless kanks that make up the majority of the cash cow want to be super heros too and if it isn’t handed to them they are gonna go somewhere else rather than work to be a super hero. For the game companies this equation adds up to this.....No gimp, no cash.
