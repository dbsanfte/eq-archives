         <font size="1" color="#FF0000">LAST EDITED ON 02-22-03 AT 05:09&nbsp;AM (PST)</font><p>Although such a thing would be a lot bigger than anything I have yet attempted, I am slowly beginning to see how it might fit together. The biggest hurdle remains the networking. I don't want to start yet in case I write something and then find it can't be networked. And then, I just unleashed one of my programs on my guild, and 2 out of the 7 who tried it couldn't get it to work...<P>Ideas should be OK though. Some of this stuff has been done before, but not all together.<BR>It should be quite possible to try out multiple ideas when the time comes, as most of the code would be the same for all of them.<BR>---<P>General ideas.<P>The idea is to get as much strategy in as possible, but without slowing things down too much. Chess is very strategic, but far too slow. Healing in a fight slows things down a lot. Also, there are several games where you have to heal every other turn to beat the boss monsters, (which are really much stonger than the player(s),) and this is boring. It should be possible to have a working system that does not include healing in battle.<P>Players would be able to heal themselves and each other, and possibly resurrect each other, when not in a combat situation. A battle would have to have a definite beginning and end, with definite people included. At the start of a battle, the game would have to switch from real-time to turn-based, and back again at the end. In a group situation, if someone leaves they should not be able to come back, otherwise they could get healed. If someone dies, it would be nice to let them stay and watch as long as they like, but to let them leave to get resurrected when they wish to.<P>Too much luck is sad. The effect of a spell should depend on multiple variables, including terrain factors and the players' relative stats. If enough variables are used it will provide the same variety that is normally produced by luck.<BR>---<P>These are 2 ideas for terrain.<P>1) Combat on the map (sort of).<P>Players have to be quite near to each other to start a battle. When one player PK attacks another, the system changes from real-time to turn-based. Each map square becomes one combat terrain square. Players only see others who are in the same battle. Fleeing would probably involve moving outside a certain distance from the enemy, or from the party leader in a group situation. The enemy would be able to follow if they saw the other person was trying to get away. Running is quite difficult, so if someone succeeds they should be protected from being attacked again for a short while.<P>Strategic possibilities from this idea: <BR>Choosing a good place to attack someone.<BR>Trying to edge towards a more suitable area of map during the fight.<BR>Running away, or chasing someone, could have some interest.<P>I don't know if this has been done before; it is certainly unusual.<P>2) Combat in a new scene.<P>Players go onto the same map square to fight. They then appear on a blown-up grid, with suitable terrain features for the area. The size of the combat area depends on the number of people involved. Fleeing could still involve distance, or relative speed changed by spells. This system does cause the problem of an artificial border round the area, which players cannot cross. Another possibility is wrapping at the edges, but that would be even wierder.<BR>---<P>Ideas on turns.<P>1) A true turn-based system.<P>Each player gets one turn each logic cycle. A turn includes some movement and some attacking/defending. If a strong spell is used, it reduces the distance that a player can move. A player can go without a spell, and so move further than usual.<P>An attack would need to take a turn after connecting to have its effect, in order to allow defending. This is a bit unrealistic, but it would be ok.<P>- Select and carry out the full set of actions for that turn :<P>The player who moved first would have a small advantage, but after that it would be fair, as it just keeps going, the same for everyone.  Turns are quite long and complicated.<P>If there were a lot of players, the game would move quite slowly for each one.<P>- 2 stages; players take it in turns to move, then round again for spells :<P>Turns are shorter and simpler, but the player who moved last each turn would have the advantage of seeing everything else that happened that turn before deciding what to do.<P>Still slow for large numbers of players.<P>- Everyone selects an action, then everyone moves :<P>The person who moved first each turn would have the advantage of seeing things when selecting an action as they would be when he moved.<BR>It could perhaps be set up so everyone moves at once, logically if not graphically.<BR>Two stages to each turn as above could help.<P>This would be faster because everyone would do their thinking at the same time.<P>2) Charge-based.<P>A player starts with no charge, and gains it slowly. Moving, or casting a spell, uses a certain amount of charge; the player queues an action and the game waits until they have enough. This could be affected by lag, but it could be set up slowly enough that there is time to think, and people with slow connections can play. A player gets some warning of incoming spells, and if they have planned carefully they can get enough charge to defend against it. This could be used in addition to mana.<P>There could be many strategic possibilites in charge-modifying spells. It would be advantageous for a player to save up longer and do a big spell, but if another player noticed this they could cast a spell to knock a large amount off the saved charge.<P>This system would mean that a player would move at the same rate no matter how many allies/enemies were there. This could be useful, but it could get confusing if everyone was moving at once.<P>I think this idea could be used to spice up a system without terrain, but if terrain is used it is probably unnecessary and unhelpful.<BR>---<P>Thoughts?
