As I said, times have changed. It wasn’t until NWN closed and I was in UO that I heard someone say, “You can’t win every fight”. This was a culture shock to me. I expected to win every fight. But the bottom line was, you could be overwhelmed by numbers in these new games. You could be killed by initiative in these new games. We had contingencies for dealing with numbers and the like. We were very successful in UO and EQ even when outnumbered. Even in today’s games, pure numbers is a loosing strategy. You may win a few more skirmishes, you may taste a few more victories, but in the end you will lose. You will be torn apart from the inside, if not by an enemy then by your own girth. 

The sad truth is there isn’t a good enough PvP system out there anymore to really support individual “gods”. One KAAOSer retired in EQ because of this very fact. Games today don’t deserve KAAOS. 

Games today are all about money. RPG development went off track when FPS’s became popular. FPS’s brought in revenue. FPS’s are about action. I believe RPG’s tried to cash in on this. This isn’t to devalue the fact that turn-based combat presents it’s own set of problems in the massive environments we are seeing today. 

Whatever the case may be, real-time action oriented PvP is the order of the day. “Cool features” and eye candy are now what separate the RPG genre from the FPS genre. Game-play and combat, sadly, do not. Unfortunately, in our genre, the death of PvP was also the death of RPG. 

We are now left with a hollow vase surrounded by c00l dud3s and l33t gam3rz. So is there a place for the gods in this new world? Not in the same form anyway. If you ever see a quality PvP game again you may see the resurrection of the old form. 

One of the biggest problems, for KAAOS, with bad PvP games, is interest. We cannot muster enough interest within KAAOS for any great length of time within any one game. KAAOSers grow bored in piece of shit games. 

KAAOS is, now, as much about attitude as anything else. As Sang mentioned, we have a lot of competent, intelligent, gamers in KAAOS. When we do hit a game we hit it very KAAOS like. We hit it with intelligence, we hit it with swagger, and we hit it violently and relentlessly. We don’t fret the small shit. A lot of gaming folk know us, we have a lot of enemies, everyone of them would love to hold a single victory above their head, for years, as some sort of crowning achievement. You tell me what that says to you. I know what it says to me “smells like worship”. I may have beaten you a million times in combat, for example, but I’d never remember because you mean shit to me.

Are KAAOSers gods? Frankly I don’t give a rat’s ass who perceives us as what. The one thing I can tell you though is the very worst thing you can do is attract our attention in a game. Once the KAAOS attitude comes into focus on a target that target will die a horrible death that will consume the very souls of those involved. Even with the shit ass PvP games out there now, there are several guilds, post NWN, which still have the taste of their own blood in their mouths. That, years later, still harbor resentment for the beatings KAAOS delivered. 

Those who know KAAOS, do they remember us as happy friendly co-gamers? Or do they remember us as motherfuckers? Oh, KAAOS still lives, KAAOS is immortal.
