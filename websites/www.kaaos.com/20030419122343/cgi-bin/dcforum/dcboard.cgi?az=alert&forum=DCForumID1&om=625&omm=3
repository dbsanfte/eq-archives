Clarifications:

- What I meant with the combat on the map idea was to have each combat group isolated from the rest of the world, though in the same geographical location and possibly visible in some way. People not involved in a battle would probably see those who were involved, perhaps semi-transparent and without any spell graphics. There may or may not be a way of joining in, but if there is, it is a deliberate action, not simply stepping on to that area of ground. People involved in a battle would probably not see anyone outside, as that would distract them.

- What I meant by variables was mostly in-battle variables. Each player would start with a similar set of stats and equipment. Stat modifying spells could be used. Terrain factors would also have an important effect on spells.
---

I agree now that a definable area is probably better for PvP. Leaving this area would mean running away. This is perhaps one thing where PvM combat could be different. Hunting down a monster or running from one in an involved way could add interest, as monsters are inherantly stupid.

Most people don't see running away as the same thing as dying. Even in games where you lose very little by dying, and gain very little by killing someone, people still run away, and the other player is usually annoyed when they do so.

On the speed of chess, two new players can take 20 minutes to play a game. Two good players can take an hour. Two grand masters can take hours or days. I would say that that's too slow for a decent RPG.
I agree that 10 seconds is too short though. Perhaps 5 minutes or so would be appropriate.

On speed and luck, the game of CyberWars is an interesting one. It is heavily luck-based, but there are clearly good players and bad players. (At the moment, I am a bad player, though there are many other Sabres who are extremely good at it...) Turns are usually 30 seconds or 1 minute, and up to 6 people can play at once. Battles last about 5 to 10 minutes. This is a game that uses two-cycle turns, to good effect.
---

Multi-cycle turns wouldn't decrease the total time per round, but each sub-cycle would be shorter, so a player wouldn't have to wait as long to be able to do something. But this idea still doesn't flow as well as the first one.

The problem of actions becoming invalid in the system where everyone moves at once could be helped by multi-cycle turns. If everyone selects where to move to, then everyone moves, there has been no interaction yet. The next sub-cycle, everyone does their spells. But this is still not a very good system.

A charge-based system without terrain is a possibility for PvM in certain circumstances. In puzzle dungeons, a terrain based system might not work very well. It is probably useful not to allow PvP in these places. There could be dedicated PvP caves with features useful for the purpose.
---

The first turns system looks like the most useful, but there is still the question of defending. I have a few ideas, but have never actually seen anything like this before.

One idea would be to have defensive spells go off immediately, but for offensive spells to wait until the start of the next turn.
When a player selects a spell, they glow, and it says that they are preparing to cast that spell on a particular target. The target player sees that, and casts the counter spell. The first player's spell is fired off at the beginning of their turn (before any movement), hits the second, and interacts with the counter. Then the first player moves and selects another spell.
There is a question of what happens if the second player instead charges up for a similar offensive spell. They will be hit during charging. In the context of reality, this would probably break their spell attempt. In the game, similarly, this choice could be a silly thing to do, but tactically, striking back does need to be a viable option. Perhaps the spell could just do the full damage, and then allow the second player to do their spell the next turn.

I think some movement should be allowed as a tactical defense against an incoming spell. Perhaps moving behind a bush wouldn't stop the spell completely, but would just reduce its effect, depending on the spell. Moving behind another player could be interesting. Some spells could home in on a particular player, and hit whatever they move behind, while other spells could be aimed at a particular place, and have a blast radius. Players would choose a spell and aim it so as to give their opponent as little scope as possible for moving out of the way.
---

Perhaps it would be useful for me to build a small prototype, with a few different terrain tiles, a few spells, and some brainless monsters to kill. It may not be networkable, but it would be good training, and may help to make some ideas more solid.
