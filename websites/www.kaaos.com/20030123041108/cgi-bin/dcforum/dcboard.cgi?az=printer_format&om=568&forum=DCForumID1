I am the GM of war guild on GL. We currently have 6 members. 4 of these are 7x, 2 5x. We take on guilds of 80+ on a consistant basis. Couple of reasons for that. First, newbie fuckwads put every character they have in the same guild. So, divide that membership by 5. That gives you less then 16 actual players. More then half of them are never on at the same time, that makes that number 8. Any given three of us are more then capable of taking those 8 down. When the prime time nights roll around we generally all show, making our numbers a full 100%, the fuckwads still can't get anywhere close to 100% of membership cause you can only be on one chr at a time. <P>Our requirements are being able to solo a deamon in a cage fight (tough for the mages, easy for the warriors), soloing a bally in the open (easy for the mages, hard for the warriors), and being able to take down ancient worms in pairs (plain hard if your not team oriented), any pair. If you join up with us and pull bone head shit when we are in PVM combat, like holding the ophid fort, we know you will do the same in PVP and you are no longer with us. We play as a group. If my health bar is red lining I have faith that my backup will get that heal there, and I can continue on offense and vice versa when a warrior leads and I back him up. He knows I will cure that poison and get the heal in, he knows it and he keeps on the planned target. <P>When the wars were in full swing we had well over 15 guilds we were warred with, the smallest being HSS (now dead and gone) House StoneSoul. H&lt;G, (Highland Guard), HSS, =B= (First Army of Britania), and some other bunch of newbified fucks all camped the Skara bank and waited for us. Over 25 of them, waiting in ambush in town so we couldn't use feild spells (God we used to fuck em up by the masses outside of town). Me, Son Goku, Magus Merlin, and Shroom Boy took all 25 of them down. I've got the screen caps. =B= disbanded that evening, HSS lasted like three more days, and the other newbified fucks all quit thier guild so fast I never even actually knew the name of the guild. Together thier membership total was prolly 250+. We had rules, Role Play before comabt, they broke those rules to try to get screen caps of us dead. We retaliated in horrible fasion, camping their tower and killing on sight as they tried to do us. The 4 of us took down three large guilds and made the 4th peace us within 3 days. H&lt;G is still around, and the leader of then HSS is as well. To this day there can be any number of them in town and I can walk up alone, outnumbered 6,8-1 and they won't say boo to me. <P>So.. does guild size matter?<P>Yes. The large guilds with masses of stupid fucks will always.. let me repeat that for you ALWAYS, lose to smaller groups of well organized players. <P>If there is anything I have learned from Kaaos, ITB, Ark, ToM, CvN, hell even the Syndicate's (LLTS for those who don't know) war stone is the that tight groups of smaller players will always prevail. ALWAYS. <P>Abs<P>

Well you are sucking cock Geo, why should he waste his time being intricate about it? Or maybe you want him to get into detail about your cock sucking, gives you good jerk off material.<P>I've witnessed your bitchness far too long to not throw in a comment. I hate arrogant cocks who think they're *good* at games. <P>Most of the people good at these mindless pieces of shit are insecure shits who need some type of persona to feel all powerful about, compared to others in a massive enviorment, so they're willing to tolerate the fact the game sucks. Size hardly matters. A small group of elite can turn the tide of anything, just because you're in a MMORPG doesn't mean you have to have castles and a large roster to affect the outcome of things.  If you had a group of ten people, that ripped ass, communciated and trusted each other like brothers, while they may not overcome huge forces, they will at least make an impact. And an impact is the only thing you can ask for. The worse thing that could happen is a meaningless existance.  One such as your's, I assure you neither I, or anyone in KAAOS will remember you six months after you yap your last yap, though there are true legends I will probably remember until I'm fifty.<P>

It's not about the players you stupid fuck, it's about the money. <P>All these fucked up games that are running around now suck. They all suck because they cater to a bunch of stupid fucks who cry about "equality" and "unfair advantages". No matter that I skilled my ass off for months to GM skills. Here... here's powerhour.... now with no work you can have GM skills too. No matter that me and my group outskilled stupid fucks and sit outside of town and kill. Here... here's Tram... now there is no danger. Blah. <P>These game designers don't give a shit about any player, or player base, except the whiny little bithces who will quit in droves if the game is to hard or they get spanked by players with superior skills and/or gaming ability. <P>That's UO, that's EQ, that is what SB will be, and SWG will be the same. They are in it to make cash. <P>Personally I would love to see UO, pre T2A patch, no trammel, no uber tamer whores, and no housing. I'd pay $50/monthly to keep the nintendoized fucking 12 year old kiddies out of it too.<P>Abs<BR>

I will further explain to you role players why it is called StarWarsGalaxies. It is a game designed for players because there are more servers to accommodate the graphics.  <P>One of the features of SWG is this: <P>“Entirely new 3D engine designed to portray the Star Wars galaxy in the greatest possible detail.” <a href="http://starwarsgalaxies.station.sony.com/features/features.jsp" target="_blank">http://starwarsgalaxies.station.sony.com/features/features.jsp</a><P>Notice they said Star Wars galaxy for the 3D engine, and not galaxies.  Do you know why they said galaxy???  It is a 3D engine for each server for you retard clowns. <P>Some Role Players such as your “Evil” guild would be kind of confused. Here is a hint when they are talking about the Role Play. When they have a capital G for Galaxies they are talking about the storyline. When they are talking about the servers with a lower case g you understand it is for the quality of the game. That is all for the playability of the game and partly because of the money. It is more for the player that will spend time in that environment since it is high quality gaming at its best. It is not always about the money. The SWG team would want to attract people to play then they charge them. The player can decide weather to stay or not since there is more competition with Online Games. There are much better games within three to four months and SWG knows that. <P>By now I hope you are semi-confused now.  I am sure you can tell me how fucking stupid I am now ROFL!!!<BR> <BR>But if you are still stupefied retards let me show you another example.<P>“You will need to pick a Galaxy for your character to play on.”<BR>See how they capitalize Galaxy here. It pertains to your character. <P>Now in the same paragraph they have this: “We are including the names of 20 of the first galaxies to help you coordinate with friends before hand.” “We will announce the names of the remaining initial galaxies when we get ready to release.” <a href="http://starwarsgalaxies.station.sony.com/features/faq.jsp" target="_blank">http://starwarsgalaxies.station.sony.com/features/faq.jsp</a><P><BR>galaxies = servers here kiddies<P><BR>

The troll tries to discredit the one that had thought with a one liner. Never with a long drawn out comeback.<P>I have learned nothing from SandDra from the past and will never learn anything since he brings nothing to the discussion. So why post if you are not going to learn a thing about the person who brings knowledge?<P>I have proved that there are servers called galaxies in SWG. At least I know some basic shit.<P>I have come to agree on the size does not matter rule with KAAOS. I learned something and I have seen it happen on a few occasions.

That's the main problem. You don't have a clue much less an opinion. Your mind is incapable of forming a complete thought much less putting it down on paper. You jump from one point to the next without any real idea of where you are headed or what you are trying to accomplish. About the only opinion I can come up with that you may or may not have is that roleplaying is for idiots and that you think KAAOS is just an evil roleplay guild. Beyond that you have said nothing that remotely resembles an opinion. <P>Now little chimp, on with the show.<P>SangDraxx<BR>KAAOS<BR>The Serpent Lord<P><BR>

True there may be a few too many characters on the same guild. I am not sure who stared this trend but I think it has something to do with being on top of the size list. For that kind of recognition it does not matter. <P>Most powerfull guilds are playing 4 to 5 different kinds of games now and it makes a good team divided. First choose a game then choose the guild. If you have friends take them with you. It is that simple. Whats the use of having a guild if they don't know what game to play??? Well they can allways change thier mind and follow friends.
