'Em Some Itties!&quot;)</FONT></FONT></TT></I></B></P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P><B><TT><FONT COLOR="#0000A0"><FONT SIZE=+1>We've been sitting
on this one a while. &nbsp;Now that the Itties are still reeling from their
recent ass beating from SOL&nbsp;and humiliating Great War loss to S.A.T.A.N.,
we think it's time ;&gt;</FONT></FONT></TT></B></P></CENTER>

<P><B>There are those ITB's whose crimes (lol), have caused them to wear
the tag of &quot;DISHONORED&quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is obviously a badge
of honor, but we'll let the itties have their fantasy ;&gt; &nbsp;Of course
KAAOS had it's evil claws in most of these bootings and/or defections,
so let's see how it happened...</B> 
<HR WIDTH="100%"></P>

<P><B><I><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">The Dishonored of House ITB:</FONT></I></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#800000">ITB&nbsp;Bolt </FONT>- He came to be known
as BOLT666 and later, Evilwarloc. &nbsp;Lured away by KAAOS when the Gods
were in their formative years, he become a long-time KAAOS&nbsp;God who
gave his reason for leaving ITB&nbsp;as there being <I>&quot;too much bullshit
and stupid shit&quot;</I>. Eloquent and to the point ;&gt;</B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#800000">ITB&nbsp;Dawg</FONT> - Quit in digust because
<I><FONT COLOR="#000000">&quot;I got sick of Faust/Drunk or whatever ya
wanna call him, bitchin about everything under the sun, and other than
me, Vort was the only person who could fight worth a damn.&quot;</FONT></I>
&nbsp;He got out while the gettin' was good. &nbsp;KAAOS&nbsp;doesn't need
to instigate this departure.</B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#800000">ITB&nbsp;Falcon</FONT> - Little is known about
this one, except that he lost a DeathMatch&nbsp;to KAAOS' very own P1rate.
&nbsp;They probably FORBID&nbsp;him to DM&nbsp;P1 cuz they knew he'd get
his ass kicked. &nbsp;He should have listened. &nbsp;Oh well ;&gt;</B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#800000">ITB&nbsp;Liana</FONT> - The lovely Liana. &nbsp;Girlfriend
of KAAOS' &nbsp;TheJoker at one time. &nbsp;And of course, she was seduced
by the Dark Side (;&gt;), and started spending too much time with KAAOS&nbsp;for
the Itties liking. They told her to knock it off, she told them to blow,
she became a KAAOS&nbsp;Goddess. She knew where the fun was ;)</B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#800000">ITB&nbsp;Mirage</FONT> - Ah yes, Mirage. He
approached Malhavok with joining KAAOS, because <I>&quot;ITB&nbsp;is gay
;p&quot;. </I>Malhavok, seeing evil blossoming in this one, was more than
happy to instigate his defection to the Gods. Mirage has risen to stellar
heights in KAAOS...AGM, PVP&nbsp;champion, and holder of Frytz Gryn's leash.

here.</A></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#800000">ITB&nbsp;P1rate</FONT> - What can one say about
P1, that hasn't already been said? &nbsp;He left ITB&nbsp;as their power
waned in early 1995, and KAAOS' fame reached new heights after he became
a God. &nbsp;Responsible for keeping TOSAdvisor on 24-hour alert, 7 days
a week. &nbsp;Faust-hater, Master-loather, KAAOS&nbsp;God and PVP&nbsp;Champion.
</B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#800000">ITB&nbsp;Priest</FONT> - Some UDL who got bored
with the itties. &nbsp;Who cares.</B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#800000">ITB&nbsp;Minx</FONT> - Oh, this one was a BEAUTY!
&nbsp;<I>&quot;I&nbsp;only joined ITB&nbsp;because I&nbsp;didn't think
I&nbsp;could get into KAAOS&quot;</I> declared Minx. &nbsp;KAAOS&nbsp;smiles
and lets her simmer awhile. &nbsp;Within a few months, the now seriously
degenerating House ITB&nbsp;promotes Minx to ITB&nbsp;AGM in an attempt
to retain her as a member. KAAOS&nbsp;strikes mere days after this event.
&nbsp;Bringing her into the Hell Hole, KAAOS&nbsp;declares to Minx &quot;You'll
be a new KAAOS&nbsp;Goddess once you delete ITB&nbsp;Minx!&quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp;ITB&nbsp;Minx,
revelling in the glory of being accepted into KAAOS, deletes ITB&nbsp;Minx
on the spot! &nbsp;One quick email confirmation (&quot;ITB&nbsp;Minx -
This is not a known user&quot;), and KAAOS&nbsp;gives her the BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOT!
ITB&nbsp;now has one less AGM, and KAAOS&nbsp;gains some brief amusement
and vile satisfaction. ;&gt;</B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#800000">ITB&nbsp;Lich </FONT>- After deleting an ITB&nbsp;AGM,
what's KAAOS&nbsp;do for an encore?&nbsp; They go straight to the top,
baby! &nbsp;Yep, KAAOS went straight for the ITB&nbsp;GM, ITB&nbsp;Lich!
&nbsp;He came wilingly. &nbsp;In covert communication with KAAOS&nbsp;for
almost a year, ITB&nbsp;Lich professed his disgust for <I>&quot;how lame
ITB&nbsp;has become&quot;</I>, and the Gods were all too eager to hear.
&nbsp;So, in a move worthy of legendary tales, the ITB&nbsp;GM&nbsp;gave
up his position as Guild Master of House ITB&nbsp;and defected to KAAOS&nbsp;in
a highly publicised departure!&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, how the Gods laughed!&nbsp;&nbsp;Snagged
the AGM&nbsp;and&nbsp;the GM! &nbsp;Now come on, admit it...you just GOTTA&nbsp;worship
that! &nbsp;;&gt;</B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#800000">ITB&nbsp;Slick </FONT>- Not real sure of the
circumstances surrounding this one, but he was once a fairly well respected
member of House ITB. &nbsp;His departure was a mystery but&nbsp;an 'ITB&nbsp;Sl1ck'
was seen a few months after ITB&nbsp;Slick was gone, and publicly denounced
the leadership of the ITB's.&nbsp;&nbsp;One in the same?&nbsp;&nbsp;Who
cares ;&gt;</B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#800000">ITB&nbsp;Wicked and ITB&nbsp;Circe</FONT> -
KAAOS' Masterpiece! &nbsp;Lured from ITB&nbsp;by the wily Hedron and cunning
Malhavok, Circe and Wicked proclaimed <I>&quot;ITB&nbsp;bores the Hell
out of us! KAAOS is much more fun ;&gt;&quot;</I>, and thus the torment
began. &nbsp;ITB&nbsp;Skorp tries to BOOT&nbsp;Circe for hanging around
KAAOS too much (worship the paranoia!), and&nbsp;she quits in disgust.
&nbsp;&nbsp;Wicked gets the BOOT,&nbsp;charged with High Treason in ITB&nbsp;for
consorting with Malhavok; <I>&quot;ITB's most hated and Ancient enemy&quot;</I>.
&nbsp;WHEEEEEEEEEE! &nbsp;After leaving ITB, Circe becomes a KAAOS Goddess,
whilst Wicked plots to marry the object of her desire,&nbsp;Malhavok.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wicked
declares Malhavok will marry her if she beats him in a PVP, and if Mal
wins, she will be his Slave for 30 days. &nbsp;Mal isn't really keen on
the idea, but sees a prime opportunity to piss the hell out of House ITB.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Malhavok
ultimately loses to ITB&nbsp;Wicked and is bound by his agreement to marry
her. &nbsp;(Some still contend he lost this dual on purpose, after contemplating
it's devastating affects on the ITB's.&nbsp;&nbsp;Those darn rumors ;&gt;)
&nbsp;The Wedding ensues and many ITB's are in attendance at Mal's and
Wicked's marriage held in the Triboar Arena. &nbsp;Hatred flows from the
attending ITB's into&nbsp;Malhavok and the assembled Gods.&nbsp;<I>&quot;We're
only here for you, Wicked hun&quot;</I>, many declare. KAAOS&nbsp;drinks
it in like nectar. &nbsp;The ensuing turmoil causes ITB&nbsp;to have more
than one bad, name-calling, bitching, HATE email circulate amongst themselves
for weeks to come. Once the last ounces of pain and anguish are milked
from this incident, Malhavok betrays ITB&nbsp;Wicked and demands a divorce.&nbsp;Losing
her recently gotten hubby and sensing her world crumbling around her, Wicked
vainly tries to re-enter ITB. &nbsp;ITB&nbsp;boots her again, as KAAOS&nbsp;watches
on in amusement and satisfaction. ;&gt;</B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#800000">ITB&nbsp;Stick</FONT> - Who? &nbsp;No KAAOS&nbsp;connection.</B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#800000">ITB&nbsp;Stormy</FONT> - Who??&nbsp;&nbsp;No
KAOS&nbsp;connection.</B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#800000">ITB&nbsp;Zone</FONT> - Who??? &nbsp;No KAAOS&nbsp;connection.</B></P>

<P><B>and last but not least...a few which the itties may not be aware...</B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#800000">ITB&nbsp;Atomic</FONT> - A male recipient of
the &quot;ITB&nbsp;Minx&quot;&nbsp;treatment. &nbsp;Reported to be <I>&quot;a
big fuckin' whiner&quot;</I> even amongst the Itties, Atomic, like Minx
before him, is led to believe his God-hood is insured once the name, ITB&nbsp;Atomic
is deleted. &nbsp;Upon deleting the name 'ITB&nbsp;Atomic', AtomicGod,
in attendence at his KAAOS&nbsp;initiation in the Hell Hole, yells &quot;WHEEEEEEEEEEE!&nbsp;&nbsp;Free
at last!&quot; &nbsp;KAAOS then yells &quot;WHEEEEEEEEEEEEE!&nbsp;&nbsp;Get
the fuck out, loser!&quot;. Atomic deletes his entire AOL&nbsp;account.
;&gt;</B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#800000">ITB&nbsp;Mohawk</FONT> - Lured by&nbsp;Godhood,
Mohawk was a trusting one.&nbsp;&nbsp;He deleted his ITB&nbsp;name WELL&nbsp;in
advance of his &quot;joining&quot;&nbsp;KAAOS. &nbsp;The Gods give him
the cold shoulder after they no longer need his dumb ass (cuz he already
deleted), and he gets pissed and pesters them for a few weeks, never to
be seen or heard from again. ;&gt;</B> 
<HR WIDTH="100%"></P>

<P><B>So, you see boys and girls, when you're ready to step up to the big
leagues, you better bring your knee pads. Cuz KAAOS&nbsp;will have you
on your knees...one way or another. &nbsp;Just ask House ITB. &gt;;)</B></P>
