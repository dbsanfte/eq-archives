"Back".. as in didn't get sucked into that excuse for a game, EQ, so went to the FPS world to spread some death for a while.  (While some of you were camping some damn tree in the depths of some murky EQ swamp, waiting for the magic hair dresser to respawn for ya.)<P>So anyone gonna be playing the new NwN?

Every PvP match will be defined by two situations: A dispel, followed immediately by a hold person.<P>Or...<P>a no-save, guaranteed insta-death spell. Can't remember if any exist off-hand, manual's not in front of me.<P>Unless, some rules are created in a tournament like fashion, otherwise.. a free-for-all would result in a clusterfuck of fighters charging, and mages wanting to pause so they can queue spells. <P>However, if a turn-based mod is released, I'm gonna fucking own you ;)<P>

Ya don't need to be pause'n if you have yer battle spells properly hotkeyed.  F1-F12 for yer main battle spells, <Ctrl}F1-F12 for your secondary, [Alt>F1-F12 for your preps.<P>~Met
