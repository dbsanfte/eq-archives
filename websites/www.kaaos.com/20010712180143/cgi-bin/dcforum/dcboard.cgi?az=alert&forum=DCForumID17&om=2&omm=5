Posted Message:
----------------------------------------------------
a) I wasn't aiming that at you J.  I've seen you digging for real information and I appreciate the effort.  I was aiming that at Wolfpack for using the delaying tactics of sending us a bunch of "backstory bullshit" instead of real information.

b) I think its sad that nobody has the balls to call BULLSHIT to Wolfpack for providing us with no more than useless fiction and I think its SADDER that the news sites are so desperate for hits that they would actually prop this "hot discussion" up as news.  Take, for example, the hot exclusive interview:

Vosx: Hey man - this Game of Thrones book by George R. Martin that I bought Sat night is awesome!....
Ashen Temper: Good! I am actually finishing up the trilogy by C.S. Friedman...
Vosx: This one is also three books. Ive been wanting to get it for a year or....
Ashen Temper: Sweet, I'll go by Barnes & Nobles today and grab them...
Vosx: Did you ever read the Tad williams series?
Ashen Temper: The Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn one... didn't read his SciFi one, though

WoW!  Man, that is mind numbingly intense journalism.  I am stunned that Vosx was able to pry such informative bits of information from Wolfpack...            Jesus Christ on a Stick!

c) Info about their previous exploits are not readily available on your news site or any other, to my knowledge.  At leastt that I can find AND I don't think its an inane question... certainly its a better question that how do you misspell "Zaeristan, Zerystan, and others..."  When I went to E3 (on my own buck) and interviewed Wolfpack they told me they thought the idea up whilst drinking beer in college... 

(That's when Marduk started asking if I wanted to put up a rant site under the Crossroads banner-ads.  I told him I didn't want to feel forced to come up with ass-kiss-content or be unable to rip Crossroads a new ass when the mood strikes me)    
 
d) Not reading the backstory stuff makes me an inane, apathetic, jackass eh?... ROFL.  How's this?  I think your unfinished column about how much we don't know is one of the greatest displays of general apathy I've ever seen... so nya nya ::chuckle::  STFU

e) "It was still a cool story. Before you read it, have a beer."  Maybe I will.  Maybe I did but think its bullshit.  Then again... maybe I wont.  You asked if I was reading the stuff... I told you it's bullshit.  You got pissy.  Examine your reasons for getting so defensive, then give me a reason to read CrossVault of ShadowStratics.  

Lets put it this way... if you were looking for the mechanics of how an upcoming Ferrari engine worked... would you want to see discussions of Italian Literature on Car & Driver's web page?? 

f) "kthxbuhbye"  Yeah.  Fuck you too.
