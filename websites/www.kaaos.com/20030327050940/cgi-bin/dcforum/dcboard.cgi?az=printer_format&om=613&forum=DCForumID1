<blockquote>Irl friends are the best kind and I talk to them without using a Computer. I am not the kind of guy that has a phone in his pocket ready to have a vibrating call to answer. I would rather have an implant in my brain and have it buzz my dick when I get someone on the line.</blockquote><hr><b><font size=2>Table of contents</font></b><hr>

Why have friends when you got KAAOS? It was asked in a sarcastic manner though. Hedron is trying to make me get a friend to read my posts. <P>Hay if I am going to be labeled a loser then why do I need friends?<P>Is it ok to be evil and have one?

First, you already have someone reading your posts or actually doing them for you. The difference between some of the posts is so dramatic that you are either have multiple personalities or someone else entirely is responsible for them. Although the other personality does have a much better grasp on grammar and how to put trains of thought into words, he/she is not very bright either nor does he/she understand what is going on around them.<P>Second, if you are going to be labeled a loser it is my opinion that you need other loser friends to keep you from committing stupid acts singularly. At least if a group of losers do it you will not be as affected by all the insults flung your way.<P>Third, is it ok to be evil and have one? Are you referring to being evil and having friends? If so then there is another example of stupidity and failure to think before posting. Of course evil players can have friends, for that matter evil people in general have friends as well.<P>Lastly I was much less harsh on your ignorant ass today because I felt a twinge of sympathy for your predicament. Being booted from GoD before you even really got in the door has got to be one of the most pathetic things I have heard of since the dismantling of DB by your Gods here at KAAOS. Have a nice day ;p<P>SangDraxx<BR>KAAOS<BR>The Serpent Lord<P><BR>
