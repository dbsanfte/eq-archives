       Shut the fuck up, you waste of human DNA, your comments are unwanted and your logic appeals to that of retarded pandas.  I don't speak for KAAOS because I am not a member, simply someone that wants to test his mettle against them.
  
You need to go fuck yourself and stay the fuck off my boards.  That's right, I said MY boards, if I'm here then it's a No Poon's Allowed area so fuck off.  I hate little fucking posers like you, always telling bullshit stories out of your ass to try and impress someone when all you're doing is making yourself look even more like a jackass.
  
If I knew where you lived I would spend the next 40 years torturing you, keeping you alive with transfusions and penicillin.  I would be the happiest person on the planet if I could rip out your internal organs a piece at a time for as long as possible.  I would keep you awake with adrenaline shots and caffeine so you could feel every slice, every rip and so I could enjoy every cry of horrid pain that is vomited with blood from your pathetic mouth.   I would taste your tears and laugh I would spit in the face of your pleas for mercy I would revel in the joy of your suffering.  I fucking hate you and your blood line with a passion only shown to the jews in Nazi Germany.

Fucking rot shit stain,
Brix
