I would have to say yes, geo is a loser. Knowing how to win every time would be boring to the geo.<P> It is good to know that the geo can lose in the game of life.

#1<BR>I was right on most posts when I said numbers would be better than quality in Shadowbane. If you have 100 rank 2 players or 100 level 30 players then you can slaughter KAAOS in a minute or maybe two. So what if your team has 50 level 50 players. 100 can beat them. So that proves I have a brain.<P>#2<BR>I still have people responding to my posts. Enough said.<P>#3<BR>Losers go away when they think they lost. I don’t think I lost one fight yet.<P>#4<BR>Everyone has some kind of personality, even a no-brainer like yourself.<P>#5<BR>I never said I was superior to all. It is just that I know everyone thinks they are right here. Which is not the case.<P>#6<BR>Where is the bad news? I bring good tidings to all except KAAOS. KAAOS will not see the good because they pass judgments to all non KAAOSers. <P>#7<BR>I am not calling myself god at least. <P>#8<BR>I wasn’t aware that there WAS a topic. It goes the other way around most times.<P>#9<BR>Maybe if you tell me what I claim to be then we can start somekind of real topic instead of this crap.<P>#10<BR>You can be a loser and a leader at the same time. Just look at history.<P>#11<BR>If I lacked communications skills then there would be no reason to be mad at me or respond to my posts.<P>#12<BR>What does that have to do with gaming? Most gamers don’t have a real life.

Haha I don't think so.<P>But the fact remains that the dictionary definitions of "loser" are inadequate.

Perhaps you shouldn't think too much then.<P>You obviously didn't read the site I referenced. It was not meant as a literal interpretation btw. I suggest you give it another review, this time more than the first paragraph or two.....you may just come away with a higher understanding of the loser phenom.<P>Losers have many defining traits. There needs not be one "definition" on this site or any other site for that matter. Being perturbed by this and making statements such as "this is a very serious situation" comes dangerously close to exposing yourself as a card carrying member. <P>Azmodion<BR>KAAOS<P>

Great to hear that; people here have been way too nice to me so far.<P>Mainly I was trying to post without mentioning Geo. I expect that like most people he is more than he seems. People on the net are usually very different from what they are in reality.<P>I would be interested enough in a fight, but on some other topic than Geo or losers. And I've seen enough of the normal Good vs Evil arguments to know that they are pointless. The fighting so far has not been very impressive, but perhaps that is only because it was unbalanced. That could be interesting to see...

Was the original KAAOS really able to keep a name from the scum of the internet from names such as hedron and malise?

It’s not even spelled right to begin with.<P>All K.A.A.O.S (killing as an organized sport) want to have are boobs posted online and a game to play that is worthy of evil players. There will never be a game where good people will cater to evil online. Game Masters want to have order in all games online and not disorder or chaos since money is involved. So all you’re role-playing as “evil” players go up in smoke in reality. That is only found in real life and not in a game, ROFL!!!<P>Some even want to be evil in real life considering the way I am treated on the forum. Let’s get this right. These pages are open to the public and are not considered to be apart of your evil standards.<P>So what it all comes down to is real evil cannot live in an online game period.

Ah well Geo, here we go again. That post is just too out of it to ignore. I am basically good, but your posts are insanely illogical, and so I attack them for this abuse of logic.

You claim to be trying to make things better, but this was a better place before you came.<P>"All K.A.A.O.S want to have are boobs posted online and a game to play that is worthy of evil players."<BR>The longer and more in-depth posts here ask for a strategic game where players can pit their wits against each other. If you describe that as a game worthy of evil players, what does that say about good people? <P>"There will never be a game where good people will cater to evil online."<BR>Maybe not, but there may be a game where good people will take suggestions from evil people who know what they are talking about.<P>"Game Masters want to have order in all games online and not disorder or chaos since money is involved."<BR>Money is not always involved.

As you can tell with the second part; evil guilds have no leadership.<P>So we have some good vs evil talk but no good vs evil match to play out with pvp.

Too bad they don’t know what they are missing. A good pvp match to measure the wits within them. In KAAOS terms, “The anger that could be spewed out like a volcano. Only a perfect wave would be able to engage them to put out their steady stream of fire.” <P>All I can get out of this is a couple of things. Either companies want to encourage more and more team play and kill off pvp or there is no one telling these game companies what we really want. Consider Shadowbane for example: Too many different factions, races, and mumbo jumbo which made pvp unbalanced. Everyone needs to depend on each other. Is this a making of a super hero or vile creature? I think not.
