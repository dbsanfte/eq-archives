I really shouldn't have anything to say on this topic. I do not know the situation in EQ too well. However, your idiocy gives me enough material to write a novel.

"Your getting owned hardcore"

Ya know, you almost worried me about your sanity because you told kaaos that they were getting owned hardcore. Then I read this.

"you suck because Eye of Newt killed a member of yours"

LOL. Your entire claim to owning them is killing a single member of KAAOS, I guess I should assume it's true because it isn't much of a claim to fame.

TCE has been a joke for over a year now, and before that it was just plain unknown. TCE has alienated any possible ally or new recruit. There are no more replacements, each member you lose is permanent. Your guild is dieing, and not just in EQ to a single person. The members of TCE can abandon ship and save some face or you can continue to rot away. Don't worry, with your intelligence, I'm sure that you'll manage to lose face wherever you go.

I'll be here, enjoying the stench of TCE, I always love watching things decay.

As for KAAOS joining up with another guild. KAAOS has evolved, I think your guild still has more members than KAAOS and it's allies, yet they have absolutely destroyed you in the numbers game. 

Your guild recruits every reject that comes along, yet you try to insult 2 other guilds for grouping together for a common goal. You're an idiot. You can't comprehend much of anything, you will go down with the ship because you have already lost all face. All that is left is a few more stern ass-kickings.

Enjoy.
