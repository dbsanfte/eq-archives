         <blockquote>
         I don't understand.  You claim you will be leveling up fast so you can "control" the high-level loot-filled zones.  Can you explain the mechanics of how this will work?<P>You think "The Planes" that you must have read about at Everlore will be a key domain?  You think your guild will be able to hold the Planes?  Unless there are over 200 level 50+ members in your guild that live in a geographically diverse pattern and can keep a presence of 40 people online all the time, you won't be 0wning the Planes.  If any concerted effort is made by another guild that is "worth your time," that guild WILL succeed in wrestling the zone away from you and most likely controlling it for long enough to get everything they need.<P>And what are the Planes nowadays?  Any good stuff you can get out of Velks, VP dragons, etc etc etc, leaves Planar gear in the dust.  There are, simply put, too many regions full of good loot for you to be a "dominating force" in EverQuest.  And the game is only getting bigger.<P>Anyway, the best resist jewelry is Craft-made, not camped.  So you're not stopping anybody from getting their resistances up.  No other stats really matter in PvP, 'cept maybe AC.  Spells can be pharmed anyplace.  Epics aren't worthwhile.  Extra mana is nice, but not necessary if your team play is good and you have C2 cast on you.<P>The game you seem to be playing is just a harder bluebie EQ.  You are playing the exact same game that exists on the other servers, except for the destinction that you can be killed and ejected from your hunting area by other players who want it.<P>Why are you on Sullon?  Go to Quellious, there aren't any "gnats" there and you'll enjoy yourself more.  You can get into nice civil duels to solve arguements, and there will be no interruption in your leveling by rowdy Newts.<P>Honestly.  I hope you don't carry this mindset over to Shadowbane.  Because in Shadowbane, the only area worth "dominating" is your own fortress, and you can't do that very well if you spend all your time leveling. :-/
