I liked the counter invasion maneuvering points. But I think all these invasion maneuvers were left to the mage and peacemakers and rouges with Ultima.



 An Ultima Online warrior has a hard time to win against a veteran mage just because they don't have enough mana to heal real well. Sometimes they are immobile which most often makes the weapon they use useless. Maybe that is why they were forced to use special weapons such as using a blessed vanquishing halbert against a mage or using a special hide cloak with magic deflect clothing. The game encouraged gayness with house fighting, server lines, and gate jumping as well.

This is the reason there were tournaments. These were fun because no loot was taken most times and no magic was used with weapons. If I was still playing I would implement two guilds and they would have a no looting rule. There would be fights inside a house or dungeon and no running off the screen. One of my best times with Ultima had to be using a X-bow going inside a building or crypt. 

I agree that standard blessed equipment would be the best way to play pvp. Just like the four factions can use with silver. Another good part is the fighting inside and outside of buildings and rooms. That way people can retreat while mages cast paralyze walls behind the team. The main problem the factions idea has is the number of players on each side.


FYI – Planetside has it so if a player dies they still can get standard equipment for free.
