         Okay, I don't have time right now to read all the posts, so this may have been said already.<P>Supposedly in SB it will depend on much as PvP skill as it will levels. This will create more than just a macroing/camping game in which PvP will be PvP, not a click fest or who ever has killed more fucking monsters than the other guy. It will supposedly be possible for a level 10 or so to whoop up on a level 40 or so, given that the first has damn good PvP skills and the latter has shitty PvP skills.<P>It will also be semi turn-based so people with shitty connections (like me) will have a more level playing field. By semi turn-based i mean that there is a delay between moves, but it's not completely turn-based like in the FF series.<P>With these two factors the truly good PvPers will kick ass and the sucky ones will just suck, rather than a damned good PvPer being killed by a sucky one because of lag.<P>I'm tired of click fests, killing being purely exp, and dying because of lag. These are the major differences in SB than other games that will make it truly PvP, not just who can click the fastest, who ever has the most free time to kill monsters, and who ever has the better connection.<P>Post-max is the best time in a PvPers character, but now with these most people (hopefully) won't be driven to macroing and cheating because in SB if they're good PvPers, they can still kick ass. Many people who thought they were kick-ass PvPers will realize otherwise and some people who were never very good will find out they kick ass because the limitations on some people and stupid things that make people do better even though they aren't good will go away.(that sentence is kinda jumbled but I'm in kind of a hurry, so oh well) <P>In other words, SB will (hopfully) show who are truly good PvPers and who just had a better connection or 'puter. I predict several people leaving SB calling it bullshit and gay because SB evens the playing field for those with shitty connections and computers.
