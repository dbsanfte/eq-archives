Martin that I bought Sat night is awesome!....<BR>Ashen Temper: Good! I am actually finishing up the trilogy by C.S. Friedman...<BR>Vosx: This one is also three books. Ive been wanting to get it for a year or....<BR>Ashen Temper: Sweet, I'll go by Barnes & Nobles today and grab them...<BR>Vosx: Did you ever read the Tad williams series?<BR>Ashen Temper: The Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn one... didn't read his SciFi one, though<P>WoW! Man, that is mind numbingly intense journalism. I am stunned that Vosx was able to pry such informative bits of information from Wolfpack... Jesus Christ on a Stick!"<BR>===============================<P>That was a private icq conversation from 5 months ago with my friend that had something to do with a similar topic, and was nothing more than toungue and cheek. And before you start harping on gaming journalism - why don't you follow a damn game for 24 friggin 7  for over year, praying to get a crumb of useful information so you can justify keeping your job and giving your people something they want.<P>As it so happens, I have had many conversations about pvp, attack times, damage ratios, weapon speed vs armor numbers, theories of how pvp is supposed to work, what the hell happens during a seige, and how you actually build a damn city and what it takes - but you know, I can't tell people  like you, because when WP finds out you know this - then Im out of the loop and become the Pets.com for Shadowbane fan sites who panhandles for extra rumors to print, and spare change from J and other sites.<P>blah. Do you have something of a point with this post? - yeah. Will I act like the community tattle and 'be hard' on Wolfpack so I can please fellow frustrated fans and try to get some imaginary 'respektz' from readers while becoming the Pariah thats out of the info loop? Hell, no.<P>Who the hell cares if fans are rabid and don't know what they are getting. They know they are going to a titty bar - no we don't know if the chicks look good, or if the beer costs 10$ a bottle, or if they play country music and theres absolutely no touching allowed. WE DON"T CARE! When you been in freaking gaming prison for three years and get the chance to see some flesh - then whos going to nitpick and bitch about knowing the cover charge to the place or "are the bathrooms clean??" ARE YOU ONE OF THESE PPL??<P>STFU and wait til the next morning to bitch or get the hell out of my car. Theres always some idiot bringing me down and killing my Buzz - why arent you on the Lum boards anyway so you can hang around with the hate Shadowbane first crowd and do little sayonces to Diku MUD and pray for the golden era of MMORPG's to come back like 'Gemstone 3'?<P>Ive been on the phones and on the email trying to get them to release the info I want - the transcripts I want - but I don't get what I want all the time. And when they say "No" I don't try and use my site to get back at them. Sometimes you win - sometimes you lose. Sometimes Im covering Monica Lewinsky's white spotted dress - sometimes Im covering the damn county fair parade with Ms. Dirt Road#12.<P>It comes with the territory. Is the news worth it to you when I write it? Probably not, but I do it anyway. Will you come to SBV for hard core take no prisoners news coverage of Shadowbane - no. Thats not my MO, nor my inclination anyway. Then again, Ive been allowed a great deal of access and have been their guests in Roundrock and see the cool shit and I 'know' the difference between Wild Turkey and Chivas. It sucks to have to take my word for it - but there it is.<P>**damn Hedron, should tell someone your making threads public so certain imbeciles named Vosx can wait and make asses of themselves when less ppl are looking. Edited again for the poeple in charge. BtW - Asmo rulez.**
