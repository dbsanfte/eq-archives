         <font size="1" color="#FF0000">LAST EDITED ON May-10-01 AT 06:40&nbsp;PM (PST)</font><p>*OOC Version of Fizzle's Rant*<P><BR>I know I'm not supposed to respond to this shit, but if ya gotta problem with it fuck you and die. Besides, Laposn obviously doesn't know that this is an RP forum or he wouldn't post that shit up here. There's a difference between someone with bad RP writing skills and this bullshit. You (hopefully) didn't even make any fucking effort. <P>Of course RP stories aren't what make or break a KAAOS wannabe, but Jesus fucking Christ! What the fuck is this? Do you think by being such a fucking dumbass that KAAOS will either feel sorry for you or keep you around longer? It was kinda funny to see someone as lame as you trying to get into KAAOS for a few days, but now your act is just getting fucking old.<P>-Fizzle<BR>Your God<BR>_______________________________________________________________________<P>*RP Version of Fizzle's Rant*<P><BR>Fizzle walks into the KAAOS tavern and notices that the KAAOS Gods are looking and laughing at something in the corner. He looks over to see what they are laughing at and sees a scrawney figure wearing a jesters suit. The figure was imitating a retarded person, making stupid sounds, acting goofy, and spouting childish insults, obviously trying to entertain the Gods.<P>The KAAOS Gods stayed up late drinkin' beer, tokin' up, and watching the jester do his act. Even in thier drunken and stoned stupor, we begin to notice that his act is getting old and repetitive. As some of them start to come down they realize that the jester isn't imitating anything at all, he is just being himself. This adds a little amusement for a little while, but he was starting to get annoying as he kept repeating himself and doing the same old thing. <P>The Gods started to insult and ridicule him more than usual and were telling him to leave. Eventually he said he was leaving, but he didn't even start to leave. He kept on trying to entertain them hoping to stay at the tavern just a little longer, but the Gods just got increasingly annoyed. They began to throw things and shout at him to get out, but the jester danced his goofy dance and spouted more and more nonsense to try to please the Gods. <P>The retarded little piece of shit started to realize that he wasn't wanted at the tavern. He bagan to get very angry, so he started heading towards the door. As he was leaving, he was yelling how great he was for "spying" on a guild, although he was just allowed in the tavern that was open to the public. <P>After he left, I noticed him heading towards a McDonalds. He later claimed to be a great spy because they let him use the public bathrooms to ram a plunger handle up his ass thinking of Sean Connery as James Bond, wishing he was 007.<P><BR>-Fizzle <BR>Your God<BR>Get out of My Fucking Tavern
