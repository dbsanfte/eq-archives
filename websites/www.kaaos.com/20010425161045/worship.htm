                    <p>KAAOS lays a trap for Aracnakat??<br>
                      <br>
                      Aracnakat: LOL :) .. I'll cry ;p ... I've got to tell you 
                      something way funny ... <br>
                      <br>
                      Hedron: ? <br>
                      <br>
                      Aracnakat: When Del and I first started talking on the phone 
                      .. and he showed an interest in me ... my first reaction 
                      (since he was in KAAOS) was that this was some sort of KAAOS 
                      conspiracy to get me to drop my guard ..... even after he 
                      moved to Jersey I kept waiting for the "Punch Line" ;p :) 
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      Hedron: ROFLMGDMFAO!!!!!!!! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHA! <br>
                      <br>
                      Hedron: WWWHHHHEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! (LOL!) 
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      Aracnakat: LOL .. it's very true ;p <br>
                      <br>
                      Hedron: What was/is Del's kaaos name? I never keep track 
                      of all the alt bullshit. And I'm sure I'll forget it in 
                      2 days anyway. ;) <br>
                      <br>
                      Hedron: That's hilarious! My, you must think we're very 
                      diabolical. Ya actually thought we'd lay a real-life trap 
                      for ya? <br>
                      <br>
                      Aracnakat: He wasn't very active after his initial "Hell 
                      Hole" initiation .. he was The Riddler .. and it's not a 
                      secret anyways :) <br>
                      <br>
                      Hedron: Oh yah, I remember Rids (laughing) <br>
                      <br>
                      Aracnakat: LOL .. I wouldn't put ANYTHING past KAAOS ;p 
                      :) <br>
                      <br>
                      Hedron: Azmo mentioned him at the last bash, actually. He 
                      said he just remembers him being hilarious at the Chicago 
                      bash, 'cause he kept yelling "The RIDDLER!! The RIDDLER!!" 
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      Aracnakat: Well .. you must remember .. that there were 
                      a few KAAOS members who hated Lethal (my OOC boyfriend at 
                      the time) .. and that I'm 8 years older then Del ... I couldn't 
                      figure out why he would want anything to do with me (Old 
                      Hag and all) ... so he was in KAAOS .. and well, you guys 
                      are EVIL ;p :) <br>
                      <br>
                      Aracnakat: Del is way funny .. is why I love him :) <br>
                      Hedron: (chuckling) that's just funny as all fuck. <br>
                      <br>
                      Hedron: Of course you know I have to post this in the KAAOS 
                      worship section. ;) <br>
                      <br>
                      Aracnakat: -hehe- The day we got married (back in July) 
                      .. I said, now if you serve me with Divorce papers and start 
                      cackling something about KAAOS .. I'll know I was right 
                      ;p :) <br>
                      <br>
                      Hedron: ROFLMFAO!!! <br>
                      <br>
                      Aracnakat: LOL .. go ahead, it's pretty funny to be sure 
                      :) <br>

                  <p><b>In 
                    case you bunch of newbs didn't know it, the Deathmatch (Tm) 
                    is a KAAOS&nbsp;creation. While on TSN&nbsp;(ImagiNation Network), 
                    KAAOS&nbsp;was constantly plagued by wusses, seeking to test 
                    themselves against the best (gee, nothin' new!). At the time, 
                    PVP&nbsp;on TSN&nbsp;was fairly lame, and those who won or 
                    lost a PVP&nbsp;could really only just say &quot;Nyah, Nyah 
                    I won! &quot;, as there was no real message boards to announce 
                    your victories. &nbsp;Enter the KAAOS&nbsp;Deathmatch. &nbsp;Created 
                    by Merculus of KAAOS, The KAAOS&nbsp;Deathmatch, pitted PVP'ers 
                    against each other in a REAL&nbsp;on-line life and death struggle 
                    against each other. &nbsp;The winner would live, the loser 
                    would have to delete his character, never to show his/her 
                    face again. &nbsp;These were extreme measures to be sure, 
                    but KAAOS&nbsp;claimed enough souls back then to gain a notoriaty 
                    unmatched to this day in the area of Deathmatches. Upon coming 
                    to Neverwinter, KAAOS's Deathmatch creation was introduced 
                    to the citizens of NW&nbsp;and KAAOS found they were sheep 
                    waiting to be slaughtered. &nbsp;As Neverwinter Nights 2.0 
                    was unleashed, the programmers (Neverwinter players themselves) 
                    took KAAOS' idea and created the infamous &quot;DEATHMATCH&nbsp;CHAMBER&quot;, 
                    where it resides to this day, in the Triboar Arena. &nbsp;Shoulda 
                    been called the KAAOS&nbsp;DEATHMATCH&nbsp;CHAMBER, but at 
                    least now you know, &quot;The rest of the story&quot;.&nbsp;

                  <p>Aidynni 
                    is one of the first people to ever step foot inside Neverwinter. 
                    Through the wisdom of her many experiences, she is uniquely 
                    qualified to judge those with whom she has had contact with 
                    over her significant tenure as Elder Bard of Neverwinter. 
                    &nbsp;She has been around many years, yet few individuals 
                    deserve special remembrance, and even fewer guilds deserve 
                    it. &nbsp;Aidynni is a highly respected member of the Neverwinter 
                    Hall of Fame, Creator of the Bard's Guild, and damn fine judge 
                    of characters and Guilds...as you're about to see ;)</font></p>

                    The slow end </p>
                </center>
                <p>In 
                  the last few months of version 1, I met a few people online 
                  that would make a big impact on the New Neverwinter. One was 
                  Malhavok, who I've met while resting at Daglow's. He wanted 
                  to know if I would be interested in marrying Blaylock. I replied, 
                  &quot;yuck!&quot; and to my dismay he esped Blaylock my reply, 
                  causing him to huff over to the inn and started to complain 
                  why I thought he was not right. We all had a big laugh out of 
                  the whole bruhaha. Ever since that, we esped each other occasionally 
                  when we found ourselves together online. I've followed Malhavok's 
                  progress through the years, first in the Sierra Network where 
                  he started his guild, KAAOS, and shrugged as he transferred 
                  it over to Neverwinter, eventually eclipsing the other guilds 
                  and setting a new standard in guild management and rp lingo. 
                  It's rare to see a guild dominate the Neverwinter landscape 
                  like KAAOS. I've never seen anything like it in all my years 
                  of NWN. And it was only possible because Malhavok had the attitude, 
                  the charisma, and the drive to make it all work. With the death 
                  of version 1 came my death as a player in Neverwinter as well. 
                  I found it hard to justify spending time in a place where I 
                  was now a stranger. I could have applied for a staff position 
                  long ago like some of my other friends, but Trollsbane advised 
                  me once not to do it, with good reason. So with no commitments 
                  other than my writing obligations for the GOH magazine, I began 
                  to slowly disappear and become a ghost. With that came the loss 
                  of ties that I had worked so hard to weave as time passed and 
                  friends disappeared. My last link to the GOC, Drk Anjel, was 
                  severed when she resigned as the guild master. She didn't have 
                  to reach out to me, since I hardly knew her at all. But she 
                  did. I suspect that she and I met under another name some time 
                  ago, but I thank her anyway for her generosity in considering 
                  that there were still bards in Neverwinter. Time passes, people 
                  move on. Things can't stay and remain the same. I tried to change 
                  with it, but now I feel that my time for change has come to 
                  an end. This work is my last stand, my last link to Neverwinter 
                  as I knew it. I wanted to share it with someone before the dreams 
                  of those Neverwinter Nights, those few people in the beginning 
                  that were my brothers and sisters so long ago fade away like 
                  memory. Thank you for reading and remembering them with me.</p>
