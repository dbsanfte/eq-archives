People donating money monthly despite no requirement to do so, because they wish DSO to expand to multiple computers. I believe one of the DMs said it best when he said "Sony and Wolfpack poured millions of dollars into their projects only to get beat out by a user mod running on an AMD Box piggy backing on a cable modem"

As for everything else, it's recreated the old DSO faithfully and is about to expand even further with more towns and more areas.

Mages have lost time stop, clerics have lost Darkness (NPC AI purposes), and Harm has a fortitude save. Certain things like Shapechange not working is a hardcoded error by Bioware (autorevert when someone in the game rests) Since Bioware didn't add a DC check for rogues casting from scrolls, all level 6 through 9 scrolls have been removed to prevent 18 fighter/2 rogue "tank mages" from rolling over everyone in the game. Some classes aren't made from PvP, you know this from oNWN. Properly made characters are almost immune to death magic by default. All immunity items have been removed, in addition to those that permanent effects (Freedom, haste, etc). Instead, they give spells per day or partial immunity. 

I read those rules that the NWN:R people have, and frankly, they don't have the slightest fucking clue what it takes to PvP at level 20. For one, direct dispel is mandatory. Most people fight so layered with buffs, that it takes 1 to 2 dispels to strip them of all their enhancements. Which is standard fare in any PvP fight, but now you've gotta rebuff in combat, and that's where it gets interesting, not to mention if you've got a Balor or Elder elemental bearing down on you at the same time. 

There are no rules in our PvP. You honestly don't need them. There's a way to beat everything, including massive healing kits or fighters with their unlimited swings. All it takes is some thought and understanding what the trends are, what classes are weak to what, and the like. 

You're NEVER gonna recreate the uniqueness of a 10 cleric/11 mage PvP in oNWN unless you specifically remake the game from scratch. However, DSO PvP is pretty good.. there are enough facets to keep you interested, as opposed to Everquest or AC.

Little bit more challenging and exciting that you think. When the DMs host an Arena event, the entire game practically stops to come compete. The PvP Ladder was well received, and the placement tournament for that will take place in 9 days. Which is why I told you about this 7 days ago so that if you wanted to compete, you'd actually have time to fuck with the game and have a shot, rather than being stuck at the bottom of the PvP Ladder.

40 meg. Download it, turn off your monitor, and get a bite to eat. You've downloaded bigger MPGs of animals having sex, no doubt ;)

It contains all the graphics for the Dark Sun setting. We have an alchemy system in the game where people can make potions of haste, stoneskin, and whatnot from things they find from killing NPCs. In addition, we have a armor/weapon forging system in place that's also similar, comes from some things you find, some things you buy.

Due to a memory leak that'll probably be fixed in the next patch, performance degrades over time of standalone servers, regardless of Linux or NT. Other than that, I've seen no problems. The occasional 5 minute downtime for a reboot isn't anything detracting from the game, besides, all quests (and there are a lot of them, 20 ) have points in them where you can start up the quest without having to restart from scratch due to a crash or reboot.

See memory leak issue and the rebooting solution.

The server is soon to be split across two AMD boxes so that lag will be minimized even more. Personally, I don't give a fuck if you play. Clearly, even when it works with warez, it's like pulling teeth to get you to even look at it when I thought you might LIKE the AD&D setting and want to play a game where the DMs SPECIFICALLY have PvP balance in mind. Yeah, 6 second rounds suck, but it's do-able, and quite fun once it "slows down" for the more experienced player.

Much as possible, and as it arises, more.

Well, I'd still dominate you regardless of whether or not I choose to use numbers as letters ;)
