Date: 97-06-18 15:54:30<BR>
EDT From: Dratsaba </FONT></I></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000">Reaching in, it was wet and a little slimy.
</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000">&quot;Better than dry and unlubricated&quot;
she thought, and felt around a little more.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000">Snowie screamed in sheer pleasure, and writhed
around on the dirty floor.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000">No better treasure could be found than in this
dark cavity, and Dratsaba knew it. She'd just have to keep digging in this
cavern that seemed to never end, and that she did.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000">Her tiny fist coated with thick blood and shit,
she grasped something tangible, and held on tight. Extracting her hand
from the orafice, along with Krynals WPC Championship Pin, she frowned.
Snowie shuddered in orgasmic ecstacy.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000">It was then Drats came to the realization that,
whatever she pulled out of there was useless. This plane was going to be
wiped from existance soon, taking the crust-caked, beaten down, whore Snowie
with it. Dratsaba smiled, content in the knowledge that her own plane,
and the hell it would wreak in others as easily as it had in this one,
was never going anywhere. A real hell like this could never be erased.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000">Bored and disgusted with Snowies elation, she
turned her over on her lizard skin back, and briefly laughed at the blank
gaze Snowie offered in return. The bitches thumb eased up to her mouth,
and she sucked, complacently.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000">One scratch and Snowies &quot;I give good blow-jobs
for copper&quot; shirt was torn to shreds, laying loosely around the sides
of her sickly body cavity. Scratching deeper still through her flakey skin
and removing what seemed to be pounds of fat and flesh, she arrived at
her destination.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000">Snowies breastbone.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000">::CRACK::</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000">Dratsabas fist came down squarely on the brittle
bone, shattering it throughout the disheveled room. The toddler KAAOS Goddess
slid her hands through the hole she'd made and pulled the two sides apart
with all her might. Snowies heart still beat, her useless lifeblood pulsating
through it.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000">So small, but so deadly...Dratsaba moved past
the heart and pulled out both her lungs, still attached to her body. Not
very difficultly, they were placed over her foaming mouth, as Snowie sucked
in, violently.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000">Inhaling one lung into the other, Snowie writhed
on the floor in despair.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000">Dratsaba sat back and rested, and although
she wasn't elated about what had happened, at least she wasn't bored for
the moment. That wouldn't last long.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=-1>Wagers were rapidly passing back and forth among the
crowd gathered in the alley behind the Gilded Horseshoe Inn. The payoffs
would make no one rich, but the fight promised to be exciting. The bloodthirsty
Longsaddle crowd quieted as Xylina of KAAOS approached, followed soon after
by Lilyth of House ITB.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=-1>&quot;Cat fight!&quot;, a mage exclaimed with a maniacal
grin. &quot;Cat fight!&quot;, echoed a knight.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=-1>With that, the two warrior women tossed their felines
to the ground. Xylina's black Persian crouched low, waiting and watching,
watching and waiting. Lilyth's tabby circled warily, a low whine rumbling
in her throat. The crowd roared when the Persian pounced, claws extended,
and the fight started in earnest. Coins were exchanged again when Xylina's
Persian seemed to choke and gag, allowing Lil's tabby to pin her to the
ground. Suddenly, the Persian coughed up a hairball, frantically scratched
her hind legs at the tabby's belly, and broke free! She pounced again!
Fur was flying everywhere! </FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=-1>They were two miniature whirlwinds of claws and teeth,
bouncing across the ground, locked in a battle to the death. Xylina's fingers
knotted into tense fists as she tried to catch the black flashes of her
cat, while Lil watched the fight in concentration, knowing her tabby was
on it's ninth life. Then, suddenly, there was a sickening _snap!_.... and
it was all over. </FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=-1>Flicking a contemptuous look at the dead tabby cat,
the Persian marched proudly to Xylina's feet and began smugly licking her
bloodied paws. Xylina narrowed her eyes, gave a smirk that paled the faces
of the spectators, and collected her winnings. The knight frowned at the
leering mage. &quot;Well,&quot; the knight said, shaking his head and handing
over the wagered gold, &quot;guess you were right.... nothing beats a goddess's
pussy.&quot; </FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=-1>When you crush all before you, and you hear not a peep,
when you smash resistance like children under an avalanche, and you hear
not a peep - that's when boredom sets in.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=-1>The Gods have always had only one true enemy - boredom.
It's that state caused when nothing is a challenge, when no one defies
you, when victories are as common as blades of grass.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=-1>*** - boredom - ***</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=-1>Neverwinter, you bore us. We are your Gods, and we
are bored. Simple slashing and slaying of helpless sheep cannot hold our
interest. We watch each rutting season as the birthing cow of Neverwinter
issues forth weak little gutter-whelps to fight for it. We watch as feeble
guild after worthless guild screams for blood and is cut down by KAAOS.
And we yawn and grow more jaded and listless. Thus we send out a call -</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=-1>Writhe and twist, Neverwinter, contort and scream,
Neverwinter.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=-1>Bleed and struggle and heave. And in the throws of
agony and the thrashing pain of labor, give birth to something that daunts
your Gods.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=-1>The land is the Mother, and KAAOS is the Father. We
have raped you for years, Neverwinter. Now give us the child we ask of
you - a child to rise up and challenge the very Gods that gave it life.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=-1>Give us a fight, and take from us boredom. And in return,
we will give you what we always give you, and that which you secretly crave
- the gentle ministrations of the flesh-slashing, blood-pounding, bone-crushing
weapons of KAAOS, and the fiery burning of our power.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=-1>Thus does evil and chaos - and KAAOS - live. Thus does
the land fight stagnation.</FONT></B></P>

knew now he was my master and I called him so willingly. I looked into
his eyes and i licked my lips softly trying to get some mostiure there.
His eyes searched my face and I smiled at him. He leaned over me and kissed
me softly his lips caressing mine softly. I placed my arms around his neck
and pulled him onto me fully wanting to feel his weight upon me. </FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000080">His lips so firm upon mine I moaned softly
opening my lips to him. his tongue darting in to taste me. His hands caressing
my body. Sliding over my stomach and up caressing the curve of my breast.
I moaned again at his touch. His ended the kiss then and looked me in the
eyes...</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000080">&quot; Come to me freely my pet. Embrace me
as a free woman...you know I offer far more than that silly bond ever could.

now and at my things he slapped them softly telling me softly &quot;&quot;Open
them my pet.&quot;&quot;</FONT></B></P>

as he claimed me as his then... making me feel everything with intensity

been trying to find most of the guilds that you've been talking about and
get some info on them. And after a few dayz of searching, here's my hit
list of the really, really bad guilds. (BTW, I've found all these guilds'
internet addresses. That's the primary way of how I found out about them,
aside from all the chat that y'all have made :)</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000">1. KAAOS- By far the nastiest guild out there.
They talk about death &amp; mutilation as if it was an ok thing. Add in
all the pentagrams &amp; blood in their web page and you got a guild that
can make almost any decent person sick. This guild has got to go.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#FF0080">2. House ITB- Kinda like KAAOS, but on a lesser
scale. It still seems like all they do is try to ruin someone's fun. They
need to get a life ;P (Editors note:&nbsp;&nbsp;ROFLMAO!!!!!)</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#800000">3. MECH- unemotional killing machines? Sounds
like fun, NOT!</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#800000">4. ???- some Dark-Drow guild headed by Kh0lari.
I forgot what they're called. Looks like they're another copy of house
ITB. Nuff said?</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Everyone has their personal views about Death Matches.
KAAOS is attributed with really starting the phrase and determining what
its meaning is. Generally its a fight to the death between the two participants
with the loser deleting his screen name. Usually these fights occur inside
the Death Match Area in the Triboar Arena, but people have been known to
change the location because of the wimpy monsters that are at that fight.
Just because you go into the DM Area of the Arena does not mean that you
are doing a Death Match (although if you die and dont CAD you will have
to reroll). Rules about fight etiquite and the fact that the loser will
delete are always stated up front so there is no confusion. This happened
with Dreamforge and a KAAOS'er, he never stated the fight was a delete
fight so he didn't, period. I don't know what the circumstances of Mich's
fight were but appearently he is deleting ;/</FONT></B></P>

vs. KAAOS we were bugs. It happens. KAAOS is one of the top PVP guilds
in the game, if not the best ever. Note I said PVP guild. Respectwise,
I will take KORT's reputation over theirs anyday. We did our best and lost.
The Pages and Squires who participated should be commended. But we lost
as KORT, not as a bunch of foul-mouthed degenerates. Granted, we could
do better training the young in PVP. Cal has some ideas and maybe we can
calmly discuss them'&gt;. But we train Knights, not PVP pros.</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>When we were matched against KAAOS, it was clear that
we'd certainly lose. They really are some of the best. The surprise was
not losing but being crushed so decisively. It was a truly frustrating
couple hours when we couldn't hardly accomplish anything. Truth be told,
it's just not normal for Quad fights to end in 5 or 6 rounds. Perhaps we
were disorganized, perhaps we didn't fight well as teams... but it's hard
to tell when two of your team members punt right away, or if everyone's
held within three rounds. Even the smartest PvPer around can't demonstrate
much strategy in three rounds while outnumbered. So I really don't have
anything to say about our teamwork. </FONT>

<P><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=+1>Shards of obsydian, implanted into
the hallway floor, slowed her down a little... she grimaced. The infant

<P><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=+1>Balanced herself on her feet. Wobbled.
Crashed to her hands and knees. She scowled, as she had been graced with
the intelligence of a Goddess at birth, but certainly not the dexterity.
Standing again, she held onto the wall and scurried along it...the need
to feed drove her to the secret entryway that led to Kal's compoud. A simple
incantation muttered, and the door unlatched with an almost silent ::click::.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=+1>Silver lie unclothed on Kal's infamous
bed, exhausted from the lesson she had received from him the night before.
Her loud snores were somewhat annoying, but the simple irritation was overlooked;
Dratsaba eyed the two incongruent, petite feeders hanging loosely from
Silver's chest.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;Milk in those? Sheesh&quot;
she thought, as she climbed up onto the ornately fashioned bed dressings.
She eyed a swollen aperature, and realized Kal must have already abused
that one. It was the one she chose. She latched on and started to feed.
</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=+1>Silver slipped a sleepy eye open,
and very quickly understood what was going on. The strong hand came from
nowhere; it swatted Dratsaba, and had she not bitten down at that precise
moment, she may very well have flown across the room. </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=+1>Silver shreiked in annoyance and
pain. &quot;I don't even ~have~ any milk!&quot; she screamed, but Dratsaba
had the power to extract lactation from anything. The colostrum, followed
by sweet milk, flowed like a river.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=+1>Yet, that milk wasn't what she was
looking for. It wasn't lumpy, it wasn't rotten, and it disgusted her. </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;Don't you know that Ahlora's
got a great quantity of milk you could be drinking right now? Why waste

<P><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;Goddess milk...it's like a
fine wine, an expensive liqueor...you can't drink it all the time, or then
you wouldn't be able to stomach the bland flavor of an ordinary brew.&quot;

</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;Yes, yes....I suppose you're

who's who, don't we? Someone un Ultima asked me to provide a report on
the NWN Guilds and what they are up to. I'll attach what I said about ITB

<P><FONT COLOR="#004080"><FONT SIZE=+1>Report to Ultima: ITB (In The Bond)
- My former home in Neverwinter and still a close tie. A group reputed
for Pkilling and exceptional organization in Neverwinter since its inception
in 1992. Massive organizational abilities and aggressive instincts give
these guys a reputation bar none in NWN communities. This guild can easily
operate on name alone and MOST of the Pkillers in the game pay a great
deal of attention to them. <BR>
<BR>
For several years the guild was essentially the monsters most challenging
to kill and people dreamed of one day either becoming or beating them.
Everyone (at one time) wanted to be an ITB and only the best could get
in. Once this policy changed the guild started going down hill. Currently
this guild is more concerned with internal strife involving a fight over
power and a lot of personnel problems concerning old leaders who cannot
give it up and young members who don't know the first thing about how to
run a guild. There are very good people here though. Exceptionally skill
and adaptive players. One is writing his own video game and that takes
all his time. The current GM (Guild Master) is a former truck driver who
used to show up in everyone's home town from time to time drawing us all
into a tight group of friends. Another former leader is so far up the butt
of all the current and former staffers in NW that he knows just about everything
about everyone.... he is, however, somewhat delusional about his popularity.&nbsp;(Ed.
note:&nbsp;ROFL!!) One is a staff member at Lucas Art's, a game manufacturer.<BR>
<BR>
Another proposed a revolt to throw out the 10 top (eldest) members a little
while ago sending the guild into a huge tailspin ending only because NWN
was announced as closing.<BR>
This situation prevails in the current mentality of the guild and divisions
are insufferable in such a group. Lots of these people (the guild membership)
are, in one way or another, being demoralized because of the internal strife
and, quite frankly, I don't see an end to it given the personalities involved.
As these people become more and more alienated they will begin to break
off and look for independent homes. I have notified every one of them that
despite previous political adversity I would make them at home in whatever
capacity possible here in UO. This might involve you and my &quot;team&quot;
or it might not, we'll wait and see what the individual wants. I feel I
should let you know that I will go way out of my way to assist any ITB
requesting my assistance (without breaking certain confidences of course)
No news concerning an &quot;official move&quot; to Ultima Online and they
might be going to another game anyway as NWN shuts down. </FONT></FONT></P>
