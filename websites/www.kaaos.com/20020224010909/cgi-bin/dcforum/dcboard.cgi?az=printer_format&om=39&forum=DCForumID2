<blockquote>  It's amazing, the myriad of things that happen after a war is fought. War, a man made disaster. No other creature in known existence exactly follows a similar behaviour. Affecting thousands upon thousands of lives, all within such a short period of time. Sometimes they are over before they have even begun, and sometimes they drag on for millenia.<P>  If you look hard enough, you can find a battle from one of any number of wars fought in just about every situation. On water, on land, in the air. Dawn, noon, dusk, even in the dark of night. Should you look for it, you might even find the aftermath of one of the bloodiest battles, fought between the savage men from the north country and the arrogant imperialist mystics from the arid wastes of the south.<P>  Bodies. Strewn everywhere. In half or in full. Pieces, bits, clumps. Piled ontop of each other, on top of rocks ontop of mud, dirt, viscera, whatever you might imagine. While mose assuredly all of the bodies would be dead, perchance one such bodies might be clinging to this existance still now.<P>  A forgotten man, a nameless warrior, wounded beyond hope, yet scratching and clawing to keep his hold upon what meager life he may have led. Lying there as he struggles to take breath after breath, hoping each will not be his last, something might strike him as odd. Looking around, and not seeing or hearing any carrion of any kind, might strike him as eerie. Strange thoughts run through a mans mind as he realizes his own fate. As he might resign himself to said fate, and lie his head back upon something hard, a rock, a half battered shield, or another head, oozing blood much as his own was, he might stare up into the night sky, his vision beginning to blur. He has to wonder, then, as he looks at the last images of his life, is it just his fading vision, or was the moon split in half?<P> *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *<P>The Hammer<KDHP><BR>"Did someone save me a piece?"</blockquote><hr><b><font size=2>Table of contents</font></b><hr>
