                blackened door. Without breaking stride, as the walk up to it,

                on the essence of life. The Main Pit had been a sight, but this? 
                This was painful for Kaelith to look at. Except he couldn't NOT 
                look at it. There was no light in the room. Not a shred except 
                for what beamed in through the doorway from the flickering torches

                Prophet of KAAOS rose into the air and beamed a dark and evil 
                light around the room. It silhoueted an evil sleeping form stretched 
                out on a blood stained table. Again without breaking stride, Hedron's 
                foot rose up in a vicious kick, that slammed the table out from 
                under its occupant, crashing it into a wall and splintering half

                mid-air as though nothing had happened. With a slow stretch, he 
                turned and sat up, placing his feet on the floor. Seeming to take 
                no notice that there was no table to be sitting on.</b></font></p>

                quite comfortable. The only feature that made it look different
