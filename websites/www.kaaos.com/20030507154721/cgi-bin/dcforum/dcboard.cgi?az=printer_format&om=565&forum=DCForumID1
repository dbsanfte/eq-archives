The difference between you and Div pretending to be KAAOS (aside from the sheer absurdity of it) is that Div CAN be you aren't even worthy of ball slapping jar to the face from your Gods. You are now on familiar grounds with many other unremarkables to come in here in past years. You cling like shit to the hair of the ass.

Why have an application on a forum if you need to have a sponsor? If people want to join they can make a petition that they are interested in joining. That is the usefulness of an application by the way. I did not see the steps in joining anywhere on the site, but I did see an application. Knowing that you have to be well known before signing up for an application (that did not work anyway),that defeats the purpose of having an application. Since the one that is well know and liked will not have to sign up. Now you can take the application or you can throw it the fuck out. Makes no difference to me since there are more membership signups available on the web for Shadowbane. Do not worry about hurting any feelings, I saw the professionalism outright and I was not impressed to say the least. So the second set of rules would be to take out the application for KAAOS.

Rules for getting in:<P>1. If you can't figure out how to become a member then you have already failed.<P>2. If you think filling out a well written application is the rirst step then you have failed.<P>3. If the words; please, thank you, may I, or best regards are found anywhere on your posts you have failed.<P>4.

Sang.. I don't know why you even bother to respond to this offal.  It's obvious that not only does he have no clue, but he comes from a very long line of clueless people that somehow have escaped Dawinian evolution and have continued to pollute the gene pool.  I suspect cousins have married if not brothers and sisters.<P>Please understand Geo that I am actually not even flaming you at this point.  This is me being polite.  Engage the brain, realize you don't belong here and move on maggot.  <P>You know nothing about the guilds that post here or their members.  You know nothing about how real guilds work.  You know nothing about being a contributor of a guild that is even worth a damn.  In short, you know nothing and need to come to the realization before you hurt yourself.  <P>You're also very fortunate that it is me responding and not Div himself.  He's a good friend of mine and I know that once he gets on a good roll, he could shred you down to the very molecule.  Of course... fortunate for you as well that I'm in a good mood. ;&gt;  I can shred pretty well myself when I wish.  <P>*Waves to Ego, Rann, Rip, Kal et al.  Long time no see. ;&gt;

It may sound like I have no clue but this was an old post. I have in fact gotten some info on what makes a good guild and I do know what kind of guild or group of players these KAAOS people are. It is about making the game your own and having your own rules or strategy to boot. And it’s about no rules. The kiddies of KAAOS really like that since they can post anything they want. This would be wrong because there could be youngsters that contact this guild and get ideas of profanity and gross taboo words to use. KAAOS makes a bad role model for the majority of gamers that are playing RPG. Making this a public chat would be yet another wrong thing to do when ethics are needed with the Internet. True you get swear words when on the highway of life but this shows how professional gamers have become. In a sentence I would say don’t quit your day job KAAOS. You people are too immature to play a game without swearing or making fun of someone. In every sport there is fighting but that only leads to losing. <P>I don't know how ant saying "This is me being polite. Engage the brain, realize you don't belong here and move on maggot.” would help in this case. <P>The fact that I am learning about every guild that there is and reading before I post does provide proof that I am using the brain and am willing to form a group of players for the common good of the team.  And the other minor fact that this is the public forum part of KAAOS team and have every right to post. I am not trying to be a troll; I am trying to make good productive topics since there are none to begin with. It can be true that KAAOS is trying to be more private and want to keep the gaming secrets away from the competition but this should not be the case since no money is involved. <P>I am NOT fortunate that someone is indeed posting some well thought out sentence structures for me to read. This is because I am used to being "torn to shreds" by at least three members of KAAOS. These members are indeed trolls because they try to start something with nothing added on to prove why this is the reason. For example they may say I am a loser but never give any kind of reason except for not having friends. But do they really know if I have friends or not since this is the Internet? Also, the guild leader has nothing to do with the general forum and is never a contributor with posting ideas. This shows me that this guild is growing stale in comparison to other RPG groupings.<BR>

<font size="1" color="#FF0000">LAST EDITED ON 03-14-03 AT 03:01&nbsp;PM (PST)</font><p>Geo, all you've learned is that this isn't the type of guild for you.  Everyone has their spot they fit in and enjoy.  I personally rarely cuss unless really ticked off.<P>As for kids coming here, I think it's up to parents to know what their kids are doing.  Mine will be sitting right next to me as she grows up and I'll be kicking her arse and vice versa in online games if she doesn't grow up to hate it.  BUT... I'll be right with her and aware of what she's doing versus what most parents do these days because their too damn self-absorbed and irresponsible.  <P>KAAOS at least is who they are straight up and straight out.  They have no need for someone to come to their boards and tell them how they should be.  Move on and find where YOU belong.  As you notice, I'm not a member here, but I know some of the guys here and they are more than they seem.  Just don't expect them to jump through hoops to prove it to you.  The only people they have to be anything to is to each other and they do a pretty damn good job of that.  But you'll never see that part.<P>You're here passing judgement on people you don't know and being the hypocrit for being upset that everyone else does the same to you.  Move on and find the place you belong.  If you feel you need to, find them on whatever game they play and kick their asses there instead of board warrioring.<P>Even maggots know that once the dead flesh is eaten away there is nothing left.  They move on.

There is much I could say to this thread, but most of it would be pointless. Actually, it's all pointless, but I have some points to make anyway.<BR>---<P>"I have in fact gotten some info on what makes a good guild and I do know what kind of guild or group of players these KAAOS people are. It is about making the game your own and having your own rules or strategy to boot. And it’s about no rules."<P>There is only so much you can see from reading posts on a forum. I don't "know" them, and I don't want to, but I can see, as Sachant says, that "they are more than they seem." I can also see that <i>they are how they are</i>, and no good can come of trying to change them. The difference between our power of sight is that you are here to preach, while I am here to learn. There is much even a goodie can learn from the forces of darkness, not least that there is more to everything than meets the eye.<P>While there are no "rules" in the normal sense, if you look more carefully, there is something there. First there is the written ideology, which again, is more than it seems. Then there are clear statements of principle at many points on this board. There are other things too. I'm not going to point out any specifics though; they are for the individual to see or not to see. It's to do with what Sachant said, "Just don't expect them to jump through hoops to prove it to you." If you want to see, you have to look. Remember the old saying, "Knowledge speaks; wisdom listens." Perhaps I blind myself somewhat by preaching to you as I do, indeed that is partly why I try not to... but sometimes the situation is just so rediculous...<P>---<P>"I am not trying to be a troll; I am trying to make good productive topics since there are none to begin with."<P>There were very few topics to begin with, and the proportion of productive ones was as large as on any other forum. It is only now that the majority of topics go nowhere.<P>If you really want to fight, and to try and change people, why not find some other people to fight with? Why not go somewhere where you might be able to make a difference?<BR>For an example, have a read at <a href="http://www.scapeboard.com/2/viewforum.php?f=7" target="_blank">http://www.scapeboard.com/2/viewforum.php?f=7</a><BR>Most of the people there, if you asked them, would say they were "good". But their posts tend to suggest otherwise. Leave alone those who are happy to be evil, and go for the hypocrites who are evil but convinced they are not.

I have played nasty roles in my past years of gaming and I do know what it is like to play one. They just decided to make me a goody type of person so they can have someone to bite at; hence the trolling that still goes on after months of posts.

geo's real life based on his posts is sad. ranking his own posts, taking time to think of shit he thinks is clever. cowering inside his house he has nothing better to do but relish in being a loser and reading every post, and msg. hoping he would somehow spring up someone to share his input. this is a pathetic atempt to make a friend.
