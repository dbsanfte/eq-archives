         <blockquote>
         First of all, to answer the question “What makes a good pvp game: Classes, skills, or many special weapons?” I’d have to say....... “none of the above”. In fact, many classes, many skills and/or many special weapons could do a lot to harm “good PvP”. These are nothing more than icing for the cake. Icing needs to be used in moderation or at the very least needs to have a pre-planned quantity. Simply dumping these, willy nilly, on a pvp game will cause a severe imbalance. The bottom line is, none of these have anything to do with “good PvP”. <P>A good PvP system has to have a method to the madness. There has to be a reason the values are the values. No value can go unchecked. Good PvP games start at development. PvP should be designed first, from the end game. So the developers need to decide where the end game is going to be and start designing the combat system from that point. Once that is balanced and complete the rest of the game can be designed around it. The main problem with most of the games out there right now is they all seem to be designed from the ground up. This is a big problem for PvP balance at the end game. I know Shadowbane basically had their game complete before they started to really tackle PvP balance. Which is why it is not balanced and is not very good.<P>PvP needs to have a strong solo combat element. Games today, more and more, are being built with mass combat in mind. Adding to the design to enhance mass combat is great but only after solo combat is at the desired state. By solo I mean 1 on 1. Roleplay from a guild perspective is great but you need to have role-play for the individual before you can expect any meaningful role-play for the group. Again, true role-play, in the MMO format I believe, is going to come from a strong PvP combat system. <P>5000000 class combinations is fine if it doesn’t muddy up the PvP system. In the case of many classes/combinations the game should be balanced with 1 class or a handful of classes in mind. They will be the leading solo PvP classes and they should be balanced off each other. The other classes should be support classes and they should not be expected to win a PvP match against a main solo class (given equal player skill). Support classes can be added to “enhance” group combat or the RP experience.<P>PvP should not be designed with 1 shot kills or balance tipping situational elements (like initiative being the weighted deciding factor). Fights should last longer than a few casts or a few seconds.<P>PvP should not be designed so that pure number of players is a deciding factor. 1 + 1 should not automatically equal 2 and 2 should not always be &gt; 1.. Counter tactics and/or false tactics can help mitigate the problem of 2 less skilled players being more powerful than a skilled player. Combat needs to be about more than just “press button A and deal X damage”. Additionally, healing alone is not a valid counter tactic and developers need to stop relying on this single element.<P>The truth about combat needs to be the same for all classes. For every action there is generally a cost associated. PvP is about resources. For example, in just about every game to date, casting a spell had a cost. This cost is different in different games. Some the cost is only time, some the cost is mana, some the cost is a spell slot, some had combinations of cost (casting time + mana), etc. You cast a spell, you deal so much damage.for such and such cost. Enter melee combat. I have not seen melee combat and casting combat using the same system of resource expenditure in any game to date. Melee and caster combat are typically working on 2 totally different set of truths. This makes for a balance nightmare. Melee and caster combat needs to be using the same basic system (output vs. cost).<P>Stats are getting out of hand as well. Stats need to have a reasonable range. Pure numbers don’t really matter but the range of numbers needs to be manageable and balanced. The biggest problem with a wide range of stats is seen when you put class A next to class B. Melee classes have generally used a format to tell if an attack is successful. Casters generally, have used a different format. Typically these formats are not balanced off each other for each different type of class that have, in the past, been using very different types of systems. For example, you have a warrior with 3000 health and physical defense rating of 2000 facing a caster with 1000 health and a physical defense rating of 500. Right there, you should see a problem. Warrior attack ratings are usually designed in line with warrior defense ratings. With such a large disparity between warrior defense ratings and caster defense ratings, you end up with a situation where every attack by the warrior is successful on a caster. Similarly, if a game used the same check (and some games use a similar check) for whether or not the caster lands a spell you would end up with a situation where a caster either A) never land a cast on a warrior or B) always land a cast on another caster. Additionally, for a caster to kill a warrior he would need to dish out an assload of damage. Put that same damage output up against another caster with only 1000 health and you get ridiculously quick caster vs. caster combat. <P>Caster combat should be strategic and tactical, it shouldn’t be just about pure damage output. The very “idea” of magic lends for a wide array of attack types and/or defensive “moves”. The very limits are subject only to the imagination. You can argue all you want about how cool different melee “forms” could/would be but melee is at the core “swing sword do damage”. It is a physical action causing a physical effect that every gamer relates to. It could never be and should never be as strategic and/or tactical as caster combat. If it is, you are doing a disservice to your system by dummying down caster combat to such a large degree. Melee limitations are not bound only in imagination here, they are bound by what we are willing to accept on the physical level. Now, what we are willing to accept on a physical level can vary per the individual but it is a much more difficult proposition to get the masses to accept total disregard for the laws of physics in this case. Meanwhile, magic has no real world counterpart that could make the masses say “wait a minute, if you cast a fireball it shouldn’t be able to travel at such and such trajectory, that is physically impossible”.<P>Hell, I could go on for days but to wrap this up “what makes for good PvP”.....<P>To have good PvP the game needs to be designed to allow player skill to shine through, especially in a 1 on 1 environment. To allow player skill to shine through the system needs to have 1 set of truths about combat or 1 set of fundamentals. The game needs to have tempered stats. The game needs to have counter tactical and or/false tactical options other than simply healing. Combat needs to last more than a few seconds. Pure initiative needs to be defanged. <P>Hmm, I feel like I’m missing some other key elements here but that about sums up the items I touched on. That is not to say this is the full range of “important” elements to PvP. There are many, many more elements that need to be considered. Especially since the very nature of balance is to create a linear environment. Pure linear environments can be boring. This is another important consideration. <P>Azmodion<BR>KAAOS
