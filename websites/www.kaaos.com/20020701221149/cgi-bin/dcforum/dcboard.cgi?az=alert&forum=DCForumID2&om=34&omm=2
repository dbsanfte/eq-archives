Spud walked coolly through the deserted streets of Brellamere, wearing his entirely black outfit he had worn beneath the acolyte robes of the priesthood.  Behind him he heard a cry go up, and knew that the mutilated priest had alerted his fellows to what had occurred.  To bad he had no tongue to tell them the tale.  He was probably writing it down.

Spud grinned.  And thus my name enters the history books.  By cutting off a priests tongue and cock.  Hilarious.  During his stay at Brellamere acquiring an education Spud had been doing some side business in the shady areas of town.  A few more assassinations had occurred since Spud had come to town.  A few more thefts of valuable goods.  Spud grinned again as he realized that the mutilation of this priest would be the final straw for the sheep that blindly followed the Crimson Empire.  With every assassination Spud had accomplished the peoples faith in the Crimson Empire had dwindled.  A shiver of joy ran down his spine as he realized the power he had exercised over an entire guild and their town.  Spud had met many shady men over the past five years.  He soon came to the conclusion that he was a minority in the world in that he kept his birth name.  Lesser men borrowed their names from deities or heroes of old.  Yet lesser men adopted names that were no names at all, only a word meant to impress an adversary with it's pseudo-evil.  Spud would not be one of them.  He would not borrow from the famous or create a scary new name.  He would write his own name in the history books.

More cries were going up in the city.  “Someone has defiled the high priest!” he heard someone shout.  Spud walked on.  The city gates became visible through the fog, with it’s usual singular guard.  Crimson Empire guards … so confident … so stupid.  Spud walked up to the gates, but as he did so he unencumbered his left hand from his cloak, and gripped his dagger.  Without so much as a glance at the guard Spud walked by.

“Hey, you!  Trouble in the town right now, who are you?”

Spud said nothing in return, no noticeable gesture did he return.

“Stop, now!” the guard growled, and came towards Spud.

Spud didn’t turn his head, but could see the guard coming in his peripheral vision, with is pike lowered.  As the guards pike was two feet from his left side.  In a blur of motion Spud pivoted, grabbed the guards pike and yanked it along his body with his right hand, surprising the guard.  The guard lurched forward; Spud’s left hand was already racing toward the hole in the slit of the guards helmet.  He was satisfied by the thunk the daggers hilt made against the zygomatic arch bone above the guards right eye.

Twist

Pull

Spud thought for a second, and decided that pulling off the helmet to see his handiwork was worth the added risk.  Oops, he thought.  I missed the eyeball.  The dagger had slid around the top of the eye right into his brain, popping the eyeball out of the socket.  It was dangling by a loose thread.   Laying the man down on his back Spud severed the cord connecting the eyeball and opened the mans mouth a crack.  Setting the eyeball on the mans lips Spud turned and left the city he learned so much from behind.  Learned that guilds were made of weak men with weaker followers.  He decided that he would operate on his own.  Create chaos where he went, and let sorrow and discord follow in his wake.

For five more years Spud traveled the world, gleaning knowledge and talents where he went, but one thing never changed.  Every guild he encountered was akin to the Crimson Empire; weak and unstructured.

If they were weak, every time a rival started putting tension on them they turned around, placed both hands on the ground with ass highly in the air and received whatever their rival wanted them to receive.

If they were unstructured, they got eaten alive like children swimming in a piranha filled river.


Spud shook himself out of his introspection over what he had learned over his lifetime.  He had just crested a hill leading to a new city he was going ply his trade within.  Smoke wafted into the air, and even from this distance he could see that the city was smoldering ashes.  Curious, he went to see what had happened.

Carnage was everywhere, the smell of putrid flesh was all there was.  But he did not gag.  Searching the city was difficult, his eyes kept going to the naked raped bodies of women and the mutilated bodies of men and children.  Odd, there was no man with a weapon here.

Circling the perimeter of the city Spud found hoof prints leading into it, and followed them out.  Over yet another hill Spud found another scene of brutality, except these men had weapons.

Who would massacre an entire town after the army has been obliterated?  Spud had to find out.  Investigating the city further he found more horse tracks leading out of it once again.  He followed the track.

For many nights he followed the track, working furiously each day to make ground, ever hoping it would not rain and obscure the path.

Finally, one day the land changed.  It was odd; he walked out of a forest, and into a burned wasteland of bones and carrion feeders.  Far off he saw the pitch black pinnacle of a castle.

“Must be the lighting” Spud murmured to himself.

As he approached the castle he could hear faint cries and wails.

“Must be the wind whistling through… through what?” he wondered.

The castle was flawlessly smooth and black as pitch.  Circling it he could find no opening in its walls, no niche to climb.  It was tremendous and awe inspiring.

It seemed abandoned, except for those strange sounds.  Must be the wind in the spires.  But the tracks led here, to this place.  And here they vanished.

Perplexed, Spud knew not what to do.  But he knew he must meet the men who had destroyed that village so savagely.  That was a display of power.  Power he could respect and associate with.

Spud camped outside the keep that night.  And many, many nights to follow.

For weeks he camped there, foraging in the forest for food.  Game was scarce, and he could not afford to destroy any of the nutrients that he found.  Raw meat and blood he had learned were the best manner of sustaining health.

One night as he cracked open the bone of a deer and sucked the within he saw a light blossom in the keep.  Yet there was no window … it was just there.  Odd, that.

Spud paid it no heed, and continued with his meal.  He looked up and saw a dark figure clothed in a black robe that hid his face standing not ten feet away.

“What are you doing here.” The stranger asked.

“I followed horse tracks here from a ruined village far off to the east.  I wish to meet the men who visited destruction upon that place and join them.”  Spud said bluntly.

“Ah, do you now?” The stranger cackled with morbid glee.

“Yes.  Let me see your face, stranger.”

“Only the Gods may see my face, pissant.  Get up.”

Spud got to his feet, flipped the dagger around in his hand so that he held it by the blade, and whipped it at the strangers neck.

“I’ll see your face any— what the fuck?” The stranger had vanished and Spud’s dagger clattered to the ground.

Spud could feel cold steel against his throat.

“I would have killed you, pissant, but your aggression impresses me.”

Spud suddenly felt a tingling, and he was in a different place, dark and dank.

“What the hell?”

Spud felt a push from behind and fell headlong into even pitcher darkness.

“Welcome to the death pit pissant.  You said you wanted to meet the people who destroyed that town.  We’re them.”

It stank of piss, shit, and pussy down here, and Spud could see vague shapes huddling in darkness.

Spud grinned and laughed.

“And what is your names, stranger?”

“KAAOS.”

Spud’s grin never faltered.  He had heard of KAAOS as mere legend in his part of the world, but it was no myth, and he was here. 

Time to make the world realize its error, Spud thought.
