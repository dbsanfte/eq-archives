<blockquote><font size="1" color="#FF0000">LAST EDITED ON Jan-26-01 AT 07:46&nbsp;PM (PST)</font><p>Born in a small poor farmers home a decade before the Turning, was a child.  This child's parents were uneducated poor people with no contact to the outside world aside from the traveling merchants who traded their potatoe's for supplies.<P>The child's name was Potatoe, and he spent his days with his father plowing his namesake.  When he was ten, the world erupted in Chaos;  The sky grew dark, lightning flashed, and everyone felt the presence of the All-Father leave the world.<P>Soon thereafter a band of rough men crested the hill on one glum morning.  Spud and his father were in the field collecting potatoes and usual.  His father looked up, and Spud saw his knuckles turn white on the handle of his hoe.<P>“Get behind me, Spud.”<P>“Yes, Father.”<P>The men advanced, and father asked them their business.  Spud noted their patchy leather armor and the chipped blades of their short swords.<P>“We be but a few hungry men, mister.  Make us a meal.”<P>“What do you have to trade?” asked father.<P>“We can trade you your life, if ye want.”<P>“Come with me”<P>As father turned toward the small cabin, the men grew surly grins and followed close.  Spud watched his father turn his hoe, so that it faced up rather than down, and shift one hand down the shaft.<P>In a blur of motion his father pivoted on one foot, and Spud’s eyes grew wide as the sharp edge of the hoe sank into the side of the mercenary leaders skull.  But father was no fighting man.  He tugged, but the hoe would not dislodge.  This was the first dead man Spud had ever seen.  It was a curious sight.<P>The mercenaries were surprised, but the nearest one jumped on his father and brought him to the ground.  The rest drew their swords, and soon his father’s blood moistened the ground.<P>One of the mercenaries grabbed Spud roughly and tossed him over his shoulder; and they all marched towards Spud’s home.  Spud didn’t know what to make of this, he kept silent and shed no tear.<P>Spuds mother was in the kitchen, there were no windows facing the field and she was unaware of what had occurred.  The mercenaries burst through the door, one grabbed her and ripped her clothes off.<P>“haha, an unexpected pleasure.  This bitch you’re mother, kid?”<P>Spud said nothing, just watched.<P>“You deaf little boy?  Aren’t you going to say anything?  I’m going to rape your mother.”<P>Spud didn’t know what rape meant.  But he soon learned.  His mother screamed and cried, then whimpered, then just laid there with eyes glazed, as each man laughed and had his way with her.<P>“What should we do with her now?” asked one of the men.<P>“Just leave her she’s worthless.  Let’s take the kid though, he looks to have some muscle.”<P>The men feasted on his parents potatoes, then bid their laughing farewell to his incapacitated mother.<P>The men set up camp that night around a campfire, and began laughing about the days exploits.  Their dead leader already forgotten, a new tough had taken over.<P>“What’s your name, kid?”  one of them asked.  Up until now, Spud had not said a word.  Just watched and listened, and most of all thought.  These men had power, and they were evil.  His parents had no power, and they were good.  His young mind thought about this again and again. <P>He had never seen someone die, and he respected his dead father.  He had put a fucking hoe in someone’s head.  Fucking was a new word to him, he had heard one of the mercenaries say it.<P>His mother had cried and screamed.  People had laughed at her.  He decided to be like his father.  Kill people.  Have Power.  But he wouldn’t be using a hoe.  And he wouldn’t be gathering potatoes.<P>Spud came out of his introspection as one of the mercenaries smacked him across the face.<P>“I asked you a question, you little pissant.  What’s your name?”<P>“Spud”  Spud said simply.<P>“What the fuck?  Were your parents stupid?”<BR>“What?” asked Spud.  He was confused.<P>“That’s the stupidest pussy name I’ve ever heard you little shit.  You are BloodLicker from now on.”<P>Spud thought this new name was stupid.  Why would he forsake his birthname?  It made no sense.<P>That night the mercenaries fell asleep after guzzling all the vodka his father had distilled from the potatoes.  They forgot about little 10 year old ‘BloodLicker’.<P>The embers in the fire still glowed and spud could see the outline of the passed out mercenaries.  He saw a dagger sticking out of the belt of the nearest one.<P>He hopped up and took the dagger out of the belt.  Not bothering to be silent.  He knew these men wouldn’t wake up, just like his father never woke up when he drank the vodka.<P>Power.  His dad had killed a man, but he wasn’t powerful enough to kill them all.  Spud would kill them all for him.  His father had showed him what it took to make it in this world.  He forgot about his mother.  She had just cried.<P>One by one Spud went around the circle and cut jabbed the knife straight down into the chest of each man as hard as he could.  He was ten, and on his first try he tried to hit the man in the chest with the point of the dagger, and it ricocheted off his rib.  The man jerked and Spud hurriedly put the knife against his chest and slid it between his ribs.  A little blood burbled from between his lips.<P>He came upon the man who had called him BloodLicker.  His father had called him Spud.  His Father had killed this mans leader.  He wasn’t BloodLicker.  All the other men he killed, but he saved this one man for last.<P>This man he had watched drink more than the others.  Spud was relatively sure he would not awaken.  But to make sure, he removed the mans weapons and threw them in the bushes.  Spud cut off all his fingers.  Then he noticed with concern that they were bleeding very much.  He did not want this man to die.  Once he had seen his father stick a hot coal against a cut on his arm, and the wound had stopped bleeding.  He did that.  Spud Cauterized the stumps of this mans fingers closed.  The man grunted in his stupor, but didn’t awaken.<P>Spud took off the mans shirt.  He was going to do this where the man would see.  <P>Spud had never learned to write much.  His mother had taught him a little, but his mother was stupid.   She had cried.<P>Spud used the dagger like a pen, and wrote “my name Spud” across the mans chest.  Then cut off his left ear for good measure.  Power.  Spud would have power over others.<BR></blockquote><hr><b><font size=2>Table of contents</font></b><hr>

Spud slid the dagger into his own belt, went to sleep amidst the dead, and was soon breathing the rhythmic sleep of a ten year old child.<P>Early in the morning he awoke and packed a bag with useful items he found amongst the stiffened corpses.  He thought it peculiar how stiff they were after death, he decided that’s what happens when peoples’ souls retract from their body.<P>Spuds father had taken him to market in a nearby village one time, and there he had heard about a huge city off to the east.  He made his way towards that city, named Brellamere, and held by a guild named Crimson Empire.<P>Spud made his way to this city, and skulked in the back alleys, learning.  He learned many things.  Among them was that this Crimson Empire was made up of fat men who pranced around as warriors.  Spud could not understand how the masses flocked to these  imbeciles.<P>He spent the next five years of his life there, being educated by the local priests.  More fat men.  Only these ones took the docile kiddies back to their rooms at night.<P>Five years had passed. Spud read all the religious bullshit the fat priests had shown him, and had learned how read and write from it.  Spud figured it was time to move on.  But before he went he wanted to show these fat priests what real power was.   He was tired of hearing about their all powerful deity, and he thought it amusing that their version of power was popping little boys anal cherries.<P>“Oy, Spud.  How’s my little potato doing this fine bright morning?”<P>“Hi Father Fred!  I’m thinking about leaving soon, but I’ve looked up to you so much these past years, I was hoping before I go you would teach me privately tonight?” Spud looked up at the puggy priest with faked bright brimming eyes.<P>“Uhmm.. ahem.  Certainly, my child.  Come to my chambers tonight.”<P>Returning to his chambers Spud grinned and flipped open a book and read until the sun set.<P>Slipping quietly out of his chambers with that same dagger from when he was ten secreted under his acolyte robes, he went to Father Fred’s chambers.<P>“Ahh, there you are my child.”<P>“Father Fred, I know what you did with the other boys sometimes.  I want to do that to.”<P>“Ah my Ruffles, please come here.”<P>Spud took a step towards the priest “Father Fred, can you turn around while I take off my robe? I’m still kind of shy…”<P>Father Fred grinned and nodded his understanding.  As the priest turned Spud made some noises with his robed and withdrew his dagger.<P>“Please don’t turn around yet Father!  Please!”<P>Fred was quivering with excitement, Spud could see.  He crept up behind him and clamped his hand over the fat mans mouth, reached around and slipped his hand under his robed.  Fred was still docile, he hadn’t seen the knife, he thought some luvin was cumin’.  Spud positioned the knife perpendicular to the priests cock, and thrust downward.  He was greeted with blood flooding out over his hand and a gratifying “plop” as the priests severed manhood bounced to the ground.  Fred started bucking against Spud’s hold; but aside from being educated Spud had been busy at night climbing walls and prowling the dark streets of Brellamere, amusing himself by evading the guards of the Crimson Pigs. <P>Fred passed out.  Spud smirked.  Can’t let him die, that’d be a shame.  He went and retrieved a torch from the wall and cauterized the priests stub closed.  The priest woke up with a squeal.  Spud clamped his hand over the fat boys mouth.<P>“Make a sound and I’ll kill you.”<P>Fred nodded.<P>“Open your mouth nice and wide and stick out your tongue.”<P>Fred did.<P>Spud cut it off.<P>“There’s your vow of silence and celibacy, you fat fuck.  Have a nice life.”<P>Spud walked out of the cathedral and was swallowed by the shadows.<P>

Spud walked coolly through the deserted streets of Brellamere, wearing his entirely black outfit he had worn beneath the acolyte robes of the priesthood.  Behind him he heard a cry go up, and knew that the mutilated priest had alerted his fellows to what had occurred.  To bad he had no tongue to tell them the tale.  He was probably writing it down.<P>Spud grinned.  And thus my name enters the history books.  By cutting off a priests tongue and cock.  Hilarious.  During his stay at Brellamere acquiring an education Spud had been doing some side business in the shady areas of town.  A few more assassinations had occurred since Spud had come to town.  A few more thefts of valuable goods.  Spud grinned again as he realized that the mutilation of this priest would be the final straw for the sheep that blindly followed the Crimson Empire.  With every assassination Spud had accomplished the peoples faith in the Crimson Empire had dwindled.  A shiver of joy ran down his spine as he realized the power he had exercised over an entire guild and their town.  Spud had met many shady men over the past five years.  He soon came to the conclusion that he was a minority in the world in that he kept his birth name.  Lesser men borrowed their names from deities or heroes of old.  Yet lesser men adopted names that were no names at all, only a word meant to impress an adversary with it's pseudo-evil.  Spud would not be one of them.  He would not borrow from the famous or create a scary new name.  He would write his own name in the history books.<P>More cries were going up in the city.  “Someone has defiled the high priest!” he heard someone shout.  Spud walked on.  The city gates became visible through the fog, with it’s usual singular guard.  Crimson Empire guards … so confident … so stupid.  Spud walked up to the gates, but as he did so he unencumbered his left hand from his cloak, and gripped his dagger.  Without so much as a glance at the guard Spud walked by.<P>“Hey, you!  Trouble in the town right now, who are you?”<P>Spud said nothing in return, no noticeable gesture did he return.<P>“Stop, now!” the guard growled, and came towards Spud.<P>Spud didn’t turn his head, but could see the guard coming in his peripheral vision, with is pike lowered.  As the guards pike was two feet from his left side.  In a blur of motion Spud pivoted, grabbed the guards pike and yanked it along his body with his right hand, surprising the guard.  The guard lurched forward; Spud’s left hand was already racing toward the hole in the slit of the guards helmet.  He was satisfied by the thunk the daggers hilt made against the zygomatic arch bone above the guards right eye.<P>Twist<P>Pull<P>Spud thought for a second, and decided that pulling off the helmet to see his handiwork was worth the added risk.  Oops, he thought.  I missed the eyeball.  The dagger had slid around the top of the eye right into his brain, popping the eyeball out of the socket.  It was dangling by a loose thread.   Laying the man down on his back Spud severed the cord connecting the eyeball and opened the mans mouth a crack.  Setting the eyeball on the mans lips Spud turned and left the city he learned so much from behind.  Learned that guilds were made of weak men with weaker followers.  He decided that he would operate on his own.  Create chaos where he went, and let sorrow and discord follow in his wake.<P>For five more years Spud traveled the world, gleaning knowledge and talents where he went, but one thing never changed.  Every guild he encountered was akin to the Crimson Empire; weak and unstructured.<P>If they were weak, every time a rival started putting tension on them they turned around, placed both hands on the ground with ass highly in the air and received whatever their rival wanted them to receive.<P>If they were unstructured, they got eaten alive like children swimming in a piranha filled river.<P><BR>Spud shook himself out of his introspection over what he had learned over his lifetime.  He had just crested a hill leading to a new city he was going ply his trade within.  Smoke wafted into the air, and even from this distance he could see that the city was smoldering ashes.  Curious, he went to see what had happened.<P>Carnage was everywhere, the smell of putrid flesh was all there was.  But he did not gag.  Searching the city was difficult, his eyes kept going to the naked raped bodies of women and the mutilated bodies of men and children.  Odd, there was no man with a weapon here.<P>Circling the perimeter of the city Spud found hoof prints leading into it, and followed them out.  Over yet another hill Spud found another scene of brutality, except these men had weapons.<P>Who would massacre an entire town after the army has been obliterated?  Spud had to find out.  Investigating the city further he found more horse tracks leading out of it once again.  He followed the track.<P>For many nights he followed the track, working furiously each day to make ground, ever hoping it would not rain and obscure the path.<P>Finally, one day the land changed.  It was odd; he walked out of a forest, and into a burned wasteland of bones and carrion feeders.  Far off he saw the pitch black pinnacle of a castle.<P>“Must be the lighting” Spud murmured to himself.<P>As he approached the castle he could hear faint cries and wails.<P>“Must be the wind whistling through… through what?” he wondered.<P>The castle was flawlessly smooth and black as pitch.  Circling it he could find no opening in its walls, no niche to climb.  It was tremendous and awe inspiring.<P>It seemed abandoned, except for those strange sounds.  Must be the wind in the spires.  But the tracks led here, to this place.  And here they vanished.<P>Perplexed, Spud knew not what to do.  But he knew he must meet the men who had destroyed that village so savagely.  That was a display of power.  Power he could respect and associate with.<P>Spud camped outside the keep that night.  And many, many nights to follow.<P>For weeks he camped there, foraging in the forest for food.  Game was scarce, and he could not afford to destroy any of the nutrients that he found.  Raw meat and blood he had learned were the best manner of sustaining health.<P>One night as he cracked open the bone of a deer and sucked the within he saw a light blossom in the keep.  Yet there was no window … it was just there.  Odd, that.<P>Spud paid it no heed, and continued with his meal.  He looked up and saw a dark figure clothed in a black robe that hid his face standing not ten feet away.<P>“What are you doing here.” The stranger asked.<P>“I followed horse tracks here from a ruined village far off to the east.  I wish to meet the men who visited destruction upon that place and join them.”  Spud said bluntly.<P>“Ah, do you now?” The stranger cackled with morbid glee.<P>“Yes.  Let me see your face, stranger.”<P>“Only the Gods may see my face, pissant.  Get up.”<P>Spud got to his feet, flipped the dagger around in his hand so that he held it by the blade, and whipped it at the strangers neck.<P>“I’ll see your face any— what the fuck?” The stranger had vanished and Spud’s dagger clattered to the ground.<P>Spud could feel cold steel against his throat.<P>“I would have killed you, pissant, but your aggression impresses me.”<P>Spud suddenly felt a tingling, and he was in a different place, dark and dank.<P>“What the hell?”<P>Spud felt a push from behind and fell headlong into even pitcher darkness.<P>“Welcome to the death pit pissant.  You said you wanted to meet the people who destroyed that town.  We’re them.”<P>It stank of piss, shit, and pussy down here, and Spud could see vague shapes huddling in darkness.<P>Spud grinned and laughed.<P>“And what is your names, stranger?”<P>“KAAOS.”<P>Spud’s grin never faltered.  He had heard of KAAOS as mere legend in his part of the world, but it was no myth, and he was here. <P>Time to make the world realize its error, Spud thought.<P>
