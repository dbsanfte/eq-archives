How about we just skip the club portion and hunt him down and deliver a beating? That is probably in your fine print somewhere too but I didn't feel like looking ;p<P>SangDraxx<BR>KAAOS<BR>The Serpent Lord<P><BR>

This topic is the typical response from people who do not know how to respond to my arguments. They can only beat up or kill something. I have learned they can only show how evil they are with RPG. Maybe some day you will live out your Role Play? When that day come they will be busted and will be the ones put in a nice cell for a few good years of your life. Is it worth it?<P> Hedron has failed to respond to my post about having to have a history to be a great team. He only has some people try and correct all my faults with grammer. To me that is yet another win.

Well you fucking idiot, if you had correct grammar in the first place, maybe people could understand what the hell you are trying to say.  But that is all moot anyways.  <P>You remind me of the Asian women who like to vomit into goblets and then drink the regurgitated meal.  You have an endless supply to the waste you spew forth daily on these boards.  I'm just wondering when you'll choke upon your own throw-up.  <P>BloodGoul.

A forum topic is for discussion and not making fun of a word or two that is misplaced. I have yet to have more than one interesting discussion from KAAOS. Arguments besides spelling and grammar should include a comeback which you are lacking. Oh, I forgot! You have to have a brain first to understand my knowledge.

Does the membership fee also include being able to keep a trophy?  Finger, eye maybe ear?  Regardless, I'm in.<P>PS: I'm fairly sure it has other people posting for it, if you look close you can see changes in it's grammer and spelling throughout all of it's posts.

*sets EasilyInfected on fire*<P>PS: I answered Hedron's question, you fisting maggot, if you would be kind enough to remove your head from that cow's ass you would have seen that.  Also you should give penicillin a try, it might help with that little problem, so fuck you and whatever ass you came out of.

Maybe you need an anti-psychotic like the other 10% of the children in the US that takes them.

You are falling into the category of Geo. It's not not anti-psychotics that the childeren are taking, it's overactive drugs. It is also not 10% it is only 2%. Get your facts straight before you quote them.<P>SangDraxx<BR>KAAOS<BR>The Serpent Lord<P><BR>
