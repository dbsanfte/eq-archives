         This post is not in reply to Geo’s topic. While off topic, you, the reader at large, will most likely find that this is no less an interesting and informative reply. Of course, all my replies are interesting and informative by default. <P>Most everyone that has read Geo’s posts have found themselves leaning towards one of three camps. The camps are as follows:<P>Camp 1:  This group has decided that Geo is a flaming retard.<P>Camp 2:  Since the bounds of Geo’s seeming idiocy can not be quantified by any scale known to mankind, this group has decreed that nobody could possibly be as stupid as Geo appears. They have therefore concluded that the only explanation could be that English is not Geo’s primary language. <P>Camp 3: This group is perplexed by Geo’s posts. They agree “yes, Geo appears to be a flaming retard” however they also agree “yes, nobody could possibly be a flaming retard to the degree that Geo appears to be”. Camp 2 would seem to offer some explanation, however, this group still hasn’t decided. It could be that Geo simply is a flaming retard or it could be that English is not Geo’s primary language or........it could be......that......English is not Geo’s primary language AND he is a flaming retard. This group has decided to reserve judgement until they can acquire more facts. <P>These camps are in a virtual war with camp 3 being Canada. Once we unmask this intriguing situation one of the first 2 camps will undoubtedly prove to be the French (always convinced they are right yet wrong as usual). <P>This brings us to this post I am replying to.....<P>&lt;i&gt;”I just so happen to be American“&lt;/i&gt;<P>Interesting. Interesting indeed. One must now ask themselves “self, what could this bit of information possibly mean? Which camp could possibly have the answers? On the surface it would seem camp 1 is correct, and they may very well be.<P>However, camp 2 could still argue that this doesn’t mean anything. It could be that Geo was not born in this country and possesses limited English skills or that Geo could simply be lying as a sort of smoke screen. Who knows, camp 2 may start throwing conspiracy allegations at camp 1. <P>Meanwhile, back at the ranch.....(camp 3).....this bit of information could shake the very foundation of the camp. I’m sure there are some defectors to camp 1 already. <P>Big trouble in little China?......or can Bullwinkle pull a rabbit out of his ass? <P>That’s for you to decide, my faithful worshipers. This is your war correspondent, Azmodion, signing off.<P>Azmodion<BR>KAAOS
