<blockquote>Just wanted to say Hey guys...<P>It's too bad there were never too many of you on Sullon Zek... The server is great fun... And I had some good times w/ your a few of your members. Hedron plays a badass enchanter... man that was back in the day ol' school EQ in LoIO heh.<P>Anyways despite that.. EQ does get old after a while... and I'm waiting for SB just like everyone else. ;)<P>Anyways... you guys still around? Vexden? anyone?<P>Antarius Dominus - Malignant - SZ<BR>Ezzlan BladeCharmer - The Elders - SB</blockquote><hr><b><font size=2>Table of contents</font></b><hr>

Yea, I don't know what I was thinking... I guess I've seen you guys around ... More so even lately than I used to.<P>Blame my 25 hour long playsessions for that post above =D heh.<P>But hey,  I was just wondering, Is there any chance that you guys are willing to do something like IE again when ShadowBane comes out?  Or are you gonna try to go at it alone?
