First of all, there is no “Holiday Spirit” in KAAOS unless you count me slitting your throat, shoving my boot up your ass, and using your worthless carcass as a boot slipper, holiday spirit. Ho Ho Ho mother fucker.

Secondly, what the hell are you flapping your gums about in such an excited fashion? What was one of the questions we asked of Wolfpack way back?....about, oh 2 years ago? 3 years ago? What is it now anyway?.....That’s right....When does Beta start?...1 week? 1 month? 1 year?...They said then exactly what all that bullshit Zelnik just spouted boils down to, and that is, “it will start when it starts”. What exactly does that mean? It means that the toilet paper I used this morning, which is hanging in a golden frame upon my wall at this very moment, is 10x more interesting and 10x more profound than if Zelnik had said what he just said 10x fast. 

Do you get it? Zelnik just shoved a dildo up your ass and you said “mmmm, just like the real thing baby”. You pathetic sack of shit, go fuck off in a forum that cares. 

I’ve been listening to it for so long that they should hire me as their “director of community development”. I could say the exact same thing as Zelnik but with a lot less effort watch:

Greetings SB fans and fannets!

Many of you are wondering when Shadowbane will start its’ closed Beta. While a lot of our development effort has gone according to blah blah blah, there have been blah blah. In a project this large and complex blah blah....obviously, it’s in our best blah...That being said, remember blah blah blah.....Our network infrastructure is all in place and blah blah...We will start Beta as soon as all the blah blahs are worked out. Stay tuned, don’t touch that dial, don’t change that channel or you may miss the late breaking beta update news! 

Azmodion “Ijustfuckedyouinthegoatass” Blah Blah
