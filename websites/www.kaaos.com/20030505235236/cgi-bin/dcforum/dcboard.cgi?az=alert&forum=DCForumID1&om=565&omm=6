Sang.. I don't know why you even bother to respond to this offal.  It's obvious that not only does he have no clue, but he comes from a very long line of clueless people that somehow have escaped Dawinian evolution and have continued to pollute the gene pool.  I suspect cousins have married if not brothers and sisters.

Please understand Geo that I am actually not even flaming you at this point.  This is me being polite.  Engage the brain, realize you don't belong here and move on maggot.  

You know nothing about the guilds that post here or their members.  You know nothing about how real guilds work.  You know nothing about being a contributor of a guild that is even worth a damn.  In short, you know nothing and need to come to the realization before you hurt yourself.  

You're also very fortunate that it is me responding and not Div himself.  He's a good friend of mine and I know that once he gets on a good roll, he could shred you down to the very molecule.  Of course... fortunate for you as well that I'm in a good mood. ;>  I can shred pretty well myself when I wish.  

*Waves to Ego, Rann, Rip, Kal et al.  Long time no see. ;>
