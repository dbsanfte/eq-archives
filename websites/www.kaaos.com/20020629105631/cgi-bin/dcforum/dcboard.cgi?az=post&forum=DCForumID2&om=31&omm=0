         <blockquote>
         From the memoirs of Leoric the Trueblade:<P><BR>"A dense fog decended from the hills that night, flooding our village with the grey mist.  The mixture of sweat and water-vapor soiled the air and made the tunics we wore stick to our bodies.  Adrenaline and fear kept us there.  <P><BR>We had all heard the stories, but none of us had ever seen him and lived.  Those that had, or claim they had only saw him from a distance, a black mirage on the horizon, and only for a second before they turned on their heels and ran until the soles of thier boots had flaked off and they left bloody footprints in the grass.<P><BR>The finest in The Empire sat with us that night, watching the hills from the farmhouse rooftop.  Our hands, clammy and white knuckled, clutched the pommels of our blades as the figure emerged. <P><BR>At first he was a mere shadow striding over the hill, but as he closed the gap between us, his image gained clarity.  A cloak, the color of midnight surrounded his muscled form.  Only his glimmering eyes could be made out from under the hood that shrouded his face.<P><BR>At about twenty paces he stopped.  My men, preparing for an epic fight stepped out from their hiding places, and climbed off the roof to look eye to eye with their adversary.<P><BR>The figure unclasped his cloak and let the heavy material slide off his shoulders and on to the ground below.  His golden hair was clasped behind his head by a thong of leather.  Under his cloak he was garbed in a simple red robe.  The color smacked of a deep crimson, and it had be long crusted with the blood and dirt of many battles.<P><BR>Upon his back he bore a longblade.  The scabbard was simple, two leather slats, bound together with rope sheathed the blade.  The hilt however was ancient in design.  It was long, with many facents empty from where jewels should have been.  <P><BR>He saw me eyeing his blade and returned an icy glance.  I suddenly realized how stupid of an idea this had been. I tried to yell out, even to turn tail and run, but sat frozen.  A trail of warmth exited my groin and pattered softly into my boot.<P><BR>The silence was broken with a yell, Forkbeard, the Northman  let loose a below to shake the countryside and swung his axe hard upon the figure.  The only problem with this action pertained to the fact that the figure wasnt there.  The warcry was cut short when a powerful hand tightened its grip around Forkbeards neck and hoisted the viking into the air.  He dropped his axe and clawed at the figure's outstretched arm as the life drained from his face.<P><BR>This was of course the point where everything went totally wrong.  The onslaught began, two soldiers, trained by my hand, and seasoned veterans for that matter charged the figure.  Steel flashed before them and their limp bodies crumpled to the ground.  The two heads he had severed came to rest beside their owners corpses.  The figure now stood with his long blade in one hand and the twitching viking in the other.  He hurled the viking effortlessly at the barn, the body coming to rest as it exited the other side of the barn, riddles with splinters.<P><BR>Blood rained on the village that night as its finest were cut down in an elegant dance of macabre.<P><BR>I too made my stand.  My blade in hand, i stood, waiting for death to to reach icy claws into my breast and claim my soul.  It wouldnt have mattered whether i stood and fought, or layed down my sword and prayed, fate had chosen me that night.  <P><BR>He just stood, calm, collected, with the hint of a smile forming at the corner of his lips.  I lunged.  It felt as if he knew what i was doing to do before i did it.  I might as well have been fighting the fog itself as he effortlessly sidestepped and parried.  I began to become furious, chopping at the air, taking frenzied hacks at an opponent who moved faster than i could possibly comprehend.  <P><BR>He stepped to the side, his blade made an arc in the moonlight and decended upon my open backside.  <P><BR>I felt the blow land, but very faintly.  As my vision cleared I saw he knelt beside me, wiped his blade upon the grass, and sheathed it.  I grasped at the dagger nestled at my belt but felt nothing.  I could not feel my legs.  I looked down to realize that they were indeed not there.<P>The figure's eyes began to glow red and flames jetted out from his back.  He let loose a sceam of agony as the flames conjoined into animated pods upon his back.  Instantly they unfurled  into great wings that lifted him off the ground.<P><BR>It was then I watched the Silent One, the Master of Blades accend into the heavens, his crimson robe billowing under the fiery wings that bore him aloft.  I pity the fool that crosses him next, for their last seconds will be of a flash of steel, and their world will go black."<BR>
