Perhaps you're the only one who can't figure it out pretty easily.<P>You see Geo, there's this thing called 'thinking'. I know you haven't tried doing it before, but perhaps someday some surgeon will be able to implant a functional brain into your skull. Maybe then you'll start thinking. A better future would be if the surgeon botched the operation and you ended up dead, not just brain dead.<P>We can dream, can't we?<P>Mortarion<BR>god of death and decay
