You can't make people believe that something that crossed the line of "okay" in this little pretend world was deserved. Thats exactly what your little post on the Lum board was doing. Nobody seemed to be getting the point, or agreeing with the behavior a suppposed neutral top-notch "gaming" site displayed.

You've yet to prove your point, and you continue to be rude and obnoxious. Is this a personna or is this just really you? One more time I shall say again - I AM A ROLEPLAYER. I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN A ROLEPLAYER. This was not a "MERC WEDDING", this was "MY WEDDING", I AM A ROLEPLAYER IN GAMES. I DO NOT USE COOL DOOD WORDS OR R33T SAYINGS. See your problem is that little issue of "seperateness". When I'm ONLINE I am a total Merc supporter, why? BECAUSE MY HUSBAND FOUNDED THE GUILD. Also because they're not whiners, lord knows I can't stand a whiner. When I am OFFLINE I am not telephoning my MERC FRIENDS and chatting with them about my plans, goals and ambition. I am not inviting them to my child's birthday party or summer barbque or MY WEDDING. So, when you posted on the Lum board about the raging hypocricy that I have shown as a NON-ROLEPLAYING MERC, and then having the audacity to have a medieval dress-up wedding - YOU WERE JUST TOTALLY WRONG. I have NEVER disrupted an online wedding. I've offiated at a few, so has Balor. Of course the sacrificial virgins did make quite a rucus when we pronounced the bride and groom Man and Wife, but what the hell. WE DID IT OUR WAY. 

OUR WEDDING WAS BETWEEN BALOR AND MYSELF. IT WAS NOT A MERC FUNCTION. Though I have endless patience for the idiocy of juveniles, I have little for you and your bizarre and quite error-ridden explanation of what "THE POINT" is that people should be getting.

You were truly ridiculous in your little essay on how "rough" I am. I said I run with a "rough" crowed - you continue to be a fine example of my point of the people I come into contact with on a regular basis and their lack of anything vaguely resembling civility. Lady China is about as rude and obnoxious as I can make her. However, I am able to put her aside and reach out to people when I know that its a real person thats in need. First you're outraged that I joked with Ego about what I thought was a little game on the board. Then you're malicious about the fact that I apologised if he felt I let him down in any way. 

Please do try and get a seperation between reality and fantasy. Between peronnas and personalities. Between valid points and imaginary grievances. 

We can go back to our regularly scheduled roleplaying any time you'd like take your paws off the issue of what I do in my LIFE and what I do ONLINE.
