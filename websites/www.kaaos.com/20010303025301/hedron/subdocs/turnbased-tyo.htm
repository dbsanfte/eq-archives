: Here's the problem Hed, nobody will ever make the perfect PvP RPG. Nobody wants to. <p>I think there's more to this than your making out Azmo. The fulcrum of the issue is size and time. Real-time vs Turn-based turns into a balance of how you want to control your game. Some of the issues to be deal with are:<p>1. <b>Time:</b> How long does it take for someone to be able to participate in combat.<p>Real-Time: One on One or fifty on fifty. Who gives a damn. You'll be able to participate in combat to the same extent.<p>Turn-based: Turns take a maximum of thirty seconds. One on One, you make a move once every minute. Fifty on Fifty, you make a move once every 50 minutes.<p>Real-Time spanks Turn-based on the ability to keep combat inter-active. You simply cannot make a massivly multi-player traditional turn-based game. It takes too many ticks for the player to be able to act. Player's will get bored.<p>2. <b>Lag</b><p>Realtime: One on One, most likely your going to be okay. Fifty on Fifty, yikes, your going to be hurting.<p>Turn-Based: One on One, or Fifty on Fifty. Doesn't matter, you still only have to deal with one person at a time.<p>On a 28.8 modem, Turn-Based combat will keep things simple, lag isn't a problem. Real-time, lag starts being a big deal fast.<p>3. <b>Communication</b><p>Real-Time: You take a hit. Real-Time combat means you've got to react instantly. The current state of internet voice capabilities can't really be used. Communication becomes reduced to pre-defined shouting, or taking time out to say things .. which hopefully your comrades will have time to read.<p>Turn-Based: Same problem, but it depends if it's a one on one or a fifty on fifty. However, either way you've got time to chat, sip your drink and spank the monkey in a relaxed fight. Here your adding to inter-activeness and providing a much more social enviorment.<p>Multi-player gaming is still new. The idea of talking to other gamers is fairly unheard of, thus real-time wins over turn-based.<p><b>The Points in Action: UO vs NWN</b><p>With the points above, compare the two games. The way the games panned out is spookily near the issues I've discussed.<p>UO - Realtime combat. <br>Advantages: Massively Multiplayer(2500), Massive Combat( Unlimited participants )<br>Disadvantages: Lag, communication and lack of community.<p>NWN - Turn-based combat.<br>Advantages: Highly social enviroment and strong community. Highly competitive atmosphere.<br>Disadvantages: Limited Multiplayer(500), limited combat(8 players at a time)<p>Both games did however do a fair job of keeping combat as an encapsulated entity. If you wanted to avoid it, you could. DSO needs mentioned at this point. Using a UO interface and turnbased combat without a "bubble" battlfield simliar to NWN doesn't work. You get people not being able to decide wether they want to be a part of combat or not. A trip to town could potentially take me an hour instead of five minutes if I get sucked into a large fight.<p><b>What this means</b><br>As you lean towards a real-time enviorment, you lose communication and social variables, lag becomes a problem. Combat is quick, potentially involving large numbers of players with little decrease in the amount of combat resources the players control.<p>As you lean towards turn-based, you gain communication and social variables, lag is easy to deal with. Combat becomes bulkier and you must restrict the amount of players allowed to participate.<p>So, when you say no one wants to make a PvP game, your right Azmo. Currently games focus on keeping things massively multi-player and constantly allowing every user to move around. What's not currently being considered is creating an online community, where people know each-other, compete and genrally enjoy themselves.<p>People are still playing the game, not the people. I think this is based off the fact that computer games are traditionally based of single player interaction with the computer. This focus is still carrying over to multi-player games. The idea that the game is a medium through which to play other people is still new, and to find that kind of genre you've got to play Quake or Starcraft, both of which don't offer a peristent universe.<p>And as we all know, a persistent universe, where you play the people is what we want.<p>Tyo Ark<br>KAAOS
