         <blockquote>
         Spud slid the dagger into his own belt, went to sleep amidst the dead, and was soon breathing the rhythmic sleep of a ten year old child.<P>Early in the morning he awoke and packed a bag with useful items he found amongst the stiffened corpses.  He thought it peculiar how stiff they were after death, he decided that’s what happens when peoples’ souls retract from their body.<P>Spuds father had taken him to market in a nearby village one time, and there he had heard about a huge city off to the east.  He made his way towards that city, named Brellamere, and held by a guild named Crimson Empire.<P>Spud made his way to this city, and skulked in the back alleys, learning.  He learned many things.  Among them was that this Crimson Empire was made up of fat men who pranced around as warriors.  Spud could not understand how the masses flocked to these  imbeciles.<P>He spent the next five years of his life there, being educated by the local priests.  More fat men.  Only these ones took the docile kiddies back to their rooms at night.<P>Five years had passed. Spud read all the religious bullshit the fat priests had shown him, and had learned how read and write from it.  Spud figured it was time to move on.  But before he went he wanted to show these fat priests what real power was.   He was tired of hearing about their all powerful deity, and he thought it amusing that their version of power was popping little boys anal cherries.<P>“Oy, Spud.  How’s my little potato doing this fine bright morning?”<P>“Hi Father Fred!  I’m thinking about leaving soon, but I’ve looked up to you so much these past years, I was hoping before I go you would teach me privately tonight?” Spud looked up at the puggy priest with faked bright brimming eyes.<P>“Uhmm.. ahem.  Certainly, my child.  Come to my chambers tonight.”<P>Returning to his chambers Spud grinned and flipped open a book and read until the sun set.<P>Slipping quietly out of his chambers with that same dagger from when he was ten secreted under his acolyte robes, he went to Father Fred’s chambers.<P>“Ahh, there you are my child.”<P>“Father Fred, I know what you did with the other boys sometimes.  I want to do that to.”<P>“Ah my Ruffles, please come here.”<P>Spud took a step towards the priest “Father Fred, can you turn around while I take off my robe? I’m still kind of shy…”<P>Father Fred grinned and nodded his understanding.  As the priest turned Spud made some noises with his robed and withdrew his dagger.<P>“Please don’t turn around yet Father!  Please!”<P>Fred was quivering with excitement, Spud could see.  He crept up behind him and clamped his hand over the fat mans mouth, reached around and slipped his hand under his robed.  Fred was still docile, he hadn’t seen the knife, he thought some luvin was cumin’.  Spud positioned the knife perpendicular to the priests cock, and thrust downward.  He was greeted with blood flooding out over his hand and a gratifying “plop” as the priests severed manhood bounced to the ground.  Fred started bucking against Spud’s hold; but aside from being educated Spud had been busy at night climbing walls and prowling the dark streets of Brellamere, amusing himself by evading the guards of the Crimson Pigs. <P>Fred passed out.  Spud smirked.  Can’t let him die, that’d be a shame.  He went and retrieved a torch from the wall and cauterized the priests stub closed.  The priest woke up with a squeal.  Spud clamped his hand over the fat boys mouth.<P>“Make a sound and I’ll kill you.”<P>Fred nodded.<P>“Open your mouth nice and wide and stick out your tongue.”<P>Fred did.<P>Spud cut it off.<P>“There’s your vow of silence and celibacy, you fat fuck.  Have a nice life.”<P>Spud walked out of the cathedral and was swallowed by the shadows.<P>
