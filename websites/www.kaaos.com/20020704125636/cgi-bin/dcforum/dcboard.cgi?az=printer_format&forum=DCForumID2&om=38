<blockquote>Reposted from the Death Hole Message Board:<P><i>Kal Mirage  Jan-31-01, 12:54 PM (PST)  <BR>"The Death Hole - A Message" </i><P>Sloshing through ankle deep gore, a small, hunched figure slowly dragged on towards its final goal. Fragments of bone and chunks of flesh floated along atop the fetid red slush. The thick ooze of what was once living, these lost souls now just an afterthought, acted as a symbol for all those who dare enter the pit. A symbol... and a warning.<P>As the hunched figure slowly made its way, every step splashed more foul grime onto its pale, naked flesh. Knowing full well the price of disobeying, the small creature plodded onward, until a dull scream echoing through the stagnant air reached its gnarled ears. With its eyes clamped shut, the messenger listened, and at once knew that it had arrived at its destination.<P>The screaming slowly grew louder. Screams of pain and anguish. Screams of despair and hopelessness. But, superceding all others, were screams of satisfaction and pure pleasure. The small creature knew that this was the pit... the Death Hole.<P>Shadows danced across the barely illuminated Pit, faster than the eye could follow. Figures dancing about, locked in the cruel, harsh battle for survival. One misstep, and you were nothing more than a deposit on the bottom of this foul pit of rancid viscera. <P>The newly deceased littered the Death Hole. Their torn corpses creating small islands where a temporary reprieve from the filth was possible. None rested long though. Rest was impossible when the battle for life, the battle to impress raged on. <P>For most, there was no chance. They were just doomed to the pit, to serve as entertainment for their masters. Their deaths brought laughter, if any response at all. Laughter at their pitiful existence as they were crushed beneath the feet of another, one last look of utter pain and despair as they realize how meaningless their worthless lives really were.<P>The messenger, this small creature, had not believed at first. But as it walked into the light, it knew that it was much worse than even what it had not wanted to believe. Fear overtook its tiny frame as the inhabitants of the pit turned on it, bloodlust written on their black and red spattered faces. Slowly, it backed away, trying to escape the fate it well knew awaited it.<P>Something under the filth caught its heel, toppling it over backwards. Only the figure's chest remained visible above the murky slop which now began filling its mouth. As the Death Hole petitioners rested and watched the wretched little creature choke, it became obvious that it was not just some toy for them to play with. <P>Half seared and half torn into the small creature's chest was a summons. The torn and scarred wording made it clear as to who was being summoned.<P>Confusion, anger, and jealously slowly died into silence. The denizens of the KAAOS Death Hole longingly watched, contempt and loathing showing in their eyes as Seiko and Judas began the long trek out of the Pit's muck and sludge.<P>The silence lasted only momentarily.<P>In its stead, laughter filled the air.<P>As always, the Gods were amused.<P><BR>Kal Mirage<BR>KAAOS<P> <BR></blockquote><hr><b><font size=2>Table of contents</font></b><hr>

A circle of hooded gods stood in the dank depths of the Hell Hole.  In their midst stood one mortal who would be more.<P>He stood... no... he... crouched.<P>Night after night this circle had gathered around Judas, witnessing the process that, as always, would either succeed or fail.  There were no guarantees.<P>Judas had transcended the other mortals in the pit by clawing and stabbing his way to a spot above them.  He had vibrated with an inner energy that denied everything around him except himself. This burning intensity had brought him to the attention of the gods.  But winning the attention of the gods does not mean that you have what it takes to become one.  That can only be discovered through trying.<P>Judas tried.<P>When Judas had first been pulled from the pit, Kal Mirage had reached a tendril of energy into his soul and had found the bindings within him that made him less than the full rage of power that he could be.  Kal had slashed those.  And not gently.  That cutting had opened the paths of Judas' soul to allow him to fill himself with power.<P>Gods and mortals are not power itself.  They are containers for power.  Each one of us can have as much or as little of the boiling cauldron of energy that the universe seethes with as we can stand... as much as we are willing to dare.  The power is out there for everyone.  The question is, who among us have the strength to claim it and contain it.<P>This was a question that Judas' was facing as he entered the circle of KAAOS again and again each night, and he attempted to draw into himself the power that would make him a god.  And at first he did well.  KAAOS could see him pulling in the essence... they could see him swelling with the terrible forces that pushed him beyond mortality.  He had frenzied with the delight of what he was becoming.<P>He had stood straight in the circle as lightning and fire had played over his skin, highlighting the bone of his jaw, the sinew of his arms.  Pain wracked through him, but he didn't flinch... at first.<P>And the gods of KAAOS watched.<P>Soon though, as the nights wore on and the trial never abated, Judas' defiance began to weaken.  His back began to curve as the pain of drawing in such vitriol made his soul shudder and twist to get away.  To the observant, it began to show that each night Judas' would draw in a little less instead of a little more... hoping that no one would notice as he sought some small respite from the crashing waves of magik and energy.<P>And the gods of KAAOS watched.<P>On the final nights, Judas would stand in the circle and glance from face to face looking for someone to reach out a hand to aid him.  He sought someone to help him understand how to contain the forces he had unleashed... someone to tell him what to do with this power, where to direct it.  When spikes in the flow would charge through him, his body would tense and his hand could almost be seen to reach out...<P>But this was KAAOS.  This was the wrack and ruin of forcing your way from mortality to godhood.  No one can help you.  The very act of helping makes the act of becoming a god impossible.  Gods do not require help.  They demand it, they enforce it, they pull it from others as worship... but they do not need it and they do not ASK for it.<P>On the final nights, Judas' was... whimpering.  All who watched knew that it was merely a matter of time, but that the process must play itself out.<P>And the gods of KAAOS watched.<P>They watched as one night Judas' body jerked and spasmed and he fell to the ground.  The fire and lightning faded from the patina on his skin and a chilled silence settled in.  The only sounds in it were small sounds from Judas' ragged breathing and the russle of his clothes and armor as he struggled to stand.<P>KAAOS had seen Judas filled with vitality and purpose and strength... and they had seen him take too much into himself and break... and now they had seen him broken.<P>Mortals break.  Gods do not.  And the gods of KAAOS watch.<P>Hedron<BR><a href="http://www.kaaos.com/hedron/falseprophet.htm" target="_blank">The False Prophet</a><BR><a href="http://www.kaaos.com" target="_blank">KAAOS</a><P>...No child, don't cry.
