Overall DAoC is a good game with a lot of potential.  

The main problem with it, is the leveling treadmill system (thus the EQ comparisons).  A lot of us in beta have been trying to fight against this system, but it doesn't look like it will be changing anytime soon.  However, they are implementing a clever quest system that should take care of over 80% of the experience to max.

There is the 3 realm warfare, but that isn't the only type of PvP that will be going on.  Each realm is going to have some arenas (where in-realm PvP will be taking place).  They are also fixing an option for an in-realm dueling system as well (in-realm PvP anywhere).  So there will be plenty of in-realm fighting, there just has to be an element of consent (head to the arenas, or ask someone to duel).

As for good old fashioned human skill.....Well that died with NWN.  DAoC is going with the rock/paper/scissors system, which as most know will add up to one #####class per realm you play in, which is a huge downer, and of course Mythic doesn't understand this.

A lot of people are interested in an FFA server for the frontier, which would be interesting, but we are still waiting for Mythic to respond to that on the beta boards.

From what I hear it is six months ahead of SB, so you may want to check it out.  

IMO DAoC blows AO out of the fuckin pool, but maybe that is just me.

SB looks very promising, hopefully they get their asses in gear.
