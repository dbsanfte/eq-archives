Koster got rapz0red by PK ReignD33r
While testing Star Wars Christmas Eve,
You can say they took out random PKs...
But as for me and KAAOS, we believe.

There were just too many Darth M@u1s...
He couldn't keep them all in check.
So after while, he went and pulled a UO
And whacked them all with his banning stick.

The k3wl d00ds then caused a huge uproar
Spamming boards with this and that;
"u sux0r dik u stup1d fukhed,"
"::shoves saber up holocrons cat::"

It's not the same without the griefers,
There's no Dorkenbane or TCE;
Suits Raph fine though, as he watches
500k subscribers sit and basket weave.

We will not be beaten, nor be broken;
We'll come back to exact revenge.
"KAAOS Inc. Emporium, come and get it,"
"Brewing Soul Spritzers to start your drinking binge."

Soon we had all the players drinking,
Lil' Jimmy thought drunkenness was rad;
So he hid Heineken in his Superman briefs
While at the supermarket with his step-dad.

His dad caught him and sent a letter
To the Congress, who got pissed;
"You're promoting drinking, you hippy scumbags,"
"Now suck this down, an order - cease and desist."

-background- cease and desist!
