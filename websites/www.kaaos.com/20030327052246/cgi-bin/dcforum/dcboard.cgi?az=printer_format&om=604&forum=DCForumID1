Ok havn't had alot of time to think about this one but it is so clear to me. Newbies is number Seven<P> We all hate em and they are also called newbs for short since we don't want to spend all day describing them since they take up all of our time asking questions when it is in the Q&A section.<P>I don't mind helping someone new its when they keep asking till they are blue in the face and I am sure KAAOS feels the same way.<P>Stay tuned for number Six.

Nunber six has to be a goody type of player that acually wants to get along with most players and even wants to talk to the the dreaded pk that will waist 2 to 5 min of your time if your killed. Not to mention the money for weapons and armor.<P>Some games are getting better with being able to save your shit but it still takes about 5 min to get back to working on skills after being killed or to fight back.<P>Good guys just play to have friends and KAAOS has none so they are mad at them.

Would you quit being such a fucking moron. You are the fucking lowest form of life I have ever encountered. You have no originality, creativeness or even a vague inkling of what your doing. As for your note above about me being anal to notice your post times that right there is the fucking difference between someone in KAAOS and your likes. We know what is going on at all times. We encounter a situation and observe things that others do not, we use npcs as a means to a victory while wanks like you kill them off immediately. We make the best of any situation while folks like you whine about the rotten hand dealt to them. Your time here has been marred by one idiotic post after another. You have impressed nobody and the simple fact that you are too fucking dense to realize that you are not even entertaining makes you worthless to the gallery here. You are dismissed.<P>SangDraxx<BR>KAAOS<BR>The Serpent Lord<P><BR>

Since I am dismissed then I will say one last thing to you oh my lord haha.<P> You have failed to convince me or anyone else that are goody type players that play for fun and fun only.<P>You have failed to realize my playing style in saying that I would kill an npc. The only time an npc would be good to kill is when they have something to offer in return such as black sandals in Ultima Online. I am a progressive player and object oriented one at best. Not kill everything one site including pking new players. That is what evil players do right? Saying you will not kill npc's would be going against your guilds playing style. (Such as the bad idea to kill an npc) The one who made the game and the game masters would prevent your team in doing such a thing? I am sure that is not the case. What about your teams idea of not having a fortification in Shadowbane?  Since KAAOS has nothing to protect with npc then how would you be using an npc as a resource? I used npc’s in Ultima to sell my junk as well. It seems like you failed worse that I did when I first made my intro to this KAAOS phenomenon. Of course I will not try to use swear words or ask to see your girlfriends or mamas breasts to boot since you are acting strange and incoherent to my style of play. That is where you come in being stuck with having to name call or give a dare. After all you must stay evil and not be like Darth Vader in episode 3. Stay in the dark side and be happy with it since that is all your team is good at.<P>Having that written down and done with at least you are listing some stuff and not doing what Hedron does by saying you are a loser. A generic form of a word that is just like saying "you suck". Much like being in a Beavis and Butthead episode when you have to ask yourself in what way do I suck?<P>Sounds like you are not the weakest link after all but are having problems knowing my gaming style ROFL! I already know your whole teams playing style. Hedron you are dismissed for being the weakest link.

Since you failed to understand the reference using the npc I won't go any further. As for failing to convince any one (although you make no mention of what we failed to do), I would check around the net and see just how many people know the name KAAOS and how many respect us. Clearly we have respece because that is what great Gods deserve. <P>SangDraxx<BR>KAAOS<BR>The Serpent Lord<P><BR>
