         <blockquote>
         You are a hypocrite.  You are an imbecile.  I'll try not to go into the fact that you can't even figure out how to make an account on EZ (easy -- get it??? easy!) boards.  Apparently you didn't even understand my post.  Because um, reading comprehension is HARD!<P>Lets get a few things straight here:<P>One.  You don't 'run with a rough crowd.'  People who run with rough crowds don't have medieval roleplay weddings and buy medieval costumes for said wedding.  They belong to gangs that kill and maim and steal and shoot drugs in real life.  There you sit in your middle class home with your middle class computer and your middle class thoughts pretending to be part of a 'rough crowd.'  You most assuredly are not, regardless of the barbs and insults you throw around on message boards.  <P>Two. As I said in my post, your wedding didn't deserve to be made fun of at all.  No one's wedding does and I've been to some pretty sorry weddings.  Your website didn't provide a laugh and as a matter of fact you all looked like you were having a nice time.  Yay you.  Nice times are good to have.  <P>Nice time or not there are times and situations where I believe (your mileage may and obviously does vary) the good natured (and perhaps not so good natured) insults we throw around on boards like this are not appropriate.  Your wedding was one of those situations.  Ego's illness was another.  Anyone's death would be yet another.  <P>Three.  The very fact that you feel that putting your wedding on display makes you deserving of ridicule just blows my mind.  Woman if you feel you *deserve* humiliation you need help.  Professional psychiatric help.  I would suggest a frontal lobotomy but its apparent you've already gone that route.  <P>Last but certainly not least is your admitted disruption of online weddings.  Regardless of what YOU think of those weddings they are important to some people.  How the fuck would you like it if a group of people came to YOUR wedding and started throwing the food around and beating up your guests?  Then, after your wedding was ruined, these people just looked at you and said "well we were roleplaying being assholes.  If you don't like it tough.  We were roleplaying."   It would pretty much ruin the event for you huh?  I'm just guessing here but I'm thinking maybe.. just maybe.. I'm on the right track.  Of course given your other idiotic ramblings here and elsewhere perhaps you'd enjoy that sort of thing -- it kind of goes with being part of a 'rough crowd.'  <P>Yes, you are a hypocrite China.  More than that, you are a coward.  You and Balor only roleplay where its 'safe' -- in real life.  You don't do it online because you know there's assholes like yourselves that will ruin it for you.  You said "Why not have people come in something that would inspire conversation and a happy little silly feeling of fun. And it DID inspire just that. Thats all I wanted, and thats exactly what I got."  Why not, indeed.  Why not have a little fun.  Aren't you happy that your fun wasn't disrupted by the type of behavior you 'support online.'<P>The fact that you are proud of pking roleplayers who don't have a clue as to how to fight back also blows my mind.  WTF? <P>Cowards.  Hypocrites.  Assholes.  Yeah the Mercs have it all.  Welcome to the 'rough crowd.'<P>Anyway I diverge in beliefs with my Kaaos buddies on this particular issue so I'm probably going to get slammed here.  Nonetheless it doesn't make you any less of an idiot.  <BR>
