<BR> To answer your question.. will the MECH's go and play MECH Warrior or something of that nature.. the answer is no. We've either joined UDL, or went on to other things. The Empire is quite dead.., it died when Aztek and I left. We were on opposite sides.. he ran a faction of MECH, and I ran the other. When we both retired, that was pretty much the end. Now, I wander EQ on the Cazic server, along with other MECH's there, that have UDL chars. I have not joined UDL myself... I have entered another guild, never to have any power again.. MECH was a second job to me, now.. Im comfortable annonymous.. as Rasta is. Never to be heard from again, except in an occasional post or two. Now that you know the death of yet another NWN guild, it should make you all feel pride that KAAOS is still around.

The death of the MECH Empire started long before you and Aztec retired. It started when Rasta retired. MECH was without a true leader after Rasta left, the only thing that kept them alive was that they had Ryman to crush the nay sayers. Ryman’s departure was inevitable as Rasta’s predecessors didn’t have the foresight to use Ryman’s conquests to the advantage of the empire or the strength to control Ryman’s volatile influence within the ranks. Ryman knocked down most of the order of Rasta’s regime as much as he knocked down opponents of the empire on the battlefield. It was inevitable that Ryman would see that the post Rasta regime neither had the strength to follow him on the battlefield or to control him within the ranks. Yes, the loss of Rasta started it all but when Ryman left the Empire was without heart and soul. It may have taken a few years for the corpse to decompose but make no mistake, the empire was dead.<P>Azmodion<BR>Historian Extraordinaire<BR>KAAOS

Perhaps, though, the end started even before. The quality of recruitment toward the end of Rasta's regime fell considerably, to go even deeper into hell afterwards. That can probably be attributed to the fact that at first, everyone wanted to roleplay a tin can, but the charm wore off shortly afterwards, and they all went back to playing their ITB mains.<P>Rend<BR>-wink-

Thus proving my point even further ;&gt; The life blood of the “empire” was draining from the vein from its inception. I will give you that Deuce was more capable than those who followed but Rasta leaving was the beginning of the end for MECH. The empire was crumbling around Deuce as he was trying to build it. He put up a good front for a while but the lack of anyone capable of actually being victorious on the battlefield besides Ryman was severely hampering his efforts. Had the “empire” played up Ryman’s conquests they might have been able to recruit some decent PvPers or had the empire made Ryman train their current troops there may have been some improvement. But the “empire” was too busy with who was going to be next to put in an “emotion chip” or which two MECHs would “link”. LOL, after Rasta left it always amused me to watch how frustrated Ryman got after yet another victory....looking over his shoulder to find not one of his guild mates there to even reload for him. Yes I found that amusing, especially when I could walk into any back room of any inn and find 3 or 4 MECHs trying on dresses and giggling as they talked about their new emotion chips. LOL....I’d take one look back at Ryman, standing there with the blood of his enemies coating his armor, and it would just make me fucking laugh. <P>Rasta’s vision died with the departure of Rasta. Deuce made an effort but he wasn’t focused on the basic principles of Rasta’s vision. He let it run wild, he let it get away from him and he let his worthless troops (though that is kind of redundant, everyone in MECH was worthless...."MECH" and "worthless" were synonymous) drag his vision into the ladies room to powder its’ nose. Rasta’s vision was based on emotionless “conquest” and “assimilation”. Deuce let the focus change to “emotion chips”, “linking” and “knitting”. LOL, what a bunch of pansies.  <P>It has been a long time and I may not have remembered exactly when they started to use the term “empire” but I remember enough of what went on back then. Remember, I know all and see all and of course, I am always right.....it’s a curse ;x<P>But Rip has a point, why the fuck are we wasting our time talking about some fucked up dead dress wearing tin can guild that nobody gives a rat’s ass about? -Laugh- they accomplished more dead then they ever did alive.....they got your god to spend 5 seconds talking about them. Heh, they should put THAT on a trophy wall.<P>Azmodion<BR>KAAOS

MECH Souls was booted from the Empire of MECH a long while ago, perhaps a year and a half or so.  According to his comment, he is correct that he started another "faction" of MECH, of which the only member therein who actually played Neverwinter was himself.<P>I remember the day of the trial, as I was there.  MECH Aztek, along with many of the old-timer MECHs, (off the top of my head, Aztek, Ember, Lotus, Moses, Jewel, Genie, and many others) actually obtained accounts to Sierra's "The Realm" where Souls was operating his faction, in which to conduct his trial.  It was unanimous that he should be booted, for crimes which included (amongst other things) starting up that faction and declaring war on the true MECH.<P>The only pansy excuse I could derive from his drivel is that he thought I had infected him with a Black Orafice virus and stole keys to a house on his UO account (which is funny because at that time I had never even played UO), simply because I knew about it.  I knew about it because the person who did it said they killed him and he was carrying his keys *chuckles*.  Before that he had his faction going, but after that it was hillarious, I have never seen an assumed grown man throw such a hissy fit in all my life.<P>Seeing he continued his faction after he was booted, it only goes to show he has contempt for everything that was considered MECH at the time of his booting.<P>Whether or not MECH has plugged in "emotion chips" and conduct their business like a soap opera, I'm not contesting that.  Actually, I believe that.  My only reason for keeping this name is the hope that when a NWN-comparable game comes out, that old-timer MECH will reunite again.  At the time of Souls booting, the "original" MECH still had many active original members.  Currently, that's not the case.<P>My point for this post is this:  Souls is not MECH.  He was booted unanimously by a significant group of original MECH members.  Nobody from the original MECH is affiliated with him besides himself.  And should original MECH come together again (if a NWN comparable game comes out), Souls will not be amongst their crowd.<P>You may now post your obligatory slams and insults now with my permission. ;p

I didnt even want to waste my time here but seeing two people falsely carrying the callsign i had no choice.  And besides, im just plain out an asshole sometimes.  <P>First off, Souls.  Get lost will you.  MECH has been trying to rid themselves of you for way too long.  Just crawl into a hole somewhere and die already.  You were booted out of the guild more than once and hell as far as anyone else knows you are probably in now as yet another alt. Purely showing that you actually have no known purpose or cause in life but to be annoying.<P>And while im at it.  Shayd,  you have the balls to show your face anywhere that it might be seen by people that you continuosly lied to?  The damage you caused to MECH was unrepairable.  Funny thing is,  whenever you were confronted about anything you turned tail and ran to mommies.  Or did you forget that too.  <P>As for the guild being dead,  it will never die.  We may not be the same as we were in the days of Deuce, Rasta, Aztek, and even Ember  but the separation and turmoil did not even begin to become a problem until you two bassackwards dipshits decided you wanted more power and tried to obtain it the easy way.  And rest assured when FW finally opens its doors MECH will once again return,  You will see more old faces than you could even begin to remember.  <P>Speak freely if you will about me and my devotion or whatever else you feel the need to.  I did and still am serving my time.  After 4 1/2 years with a guild ya tend to grow attached.<P>Speaking of the term "empire"  There should never have been a "faction"  DE  or Dark Empire was never recognized as part of the guild of MECH.  And there never was a "base" in any other game that was recognized.  MECH is not a singular gaming guild and our members are not required to play any one game in particular but we will be calling one a home.<P>Rodeo<BR>I am your reality check.

Shayd,<P>You come defending yourself to Stryk, to Rodeo, and yet nothing for me.  -Rolls eyes- Gosh I almost feel left out. Come on Shayd, answer the million dollar question....who where you? Oh Wait....I know I know, No one cause you didn't exist until after TR started. That's right! Now run along home like a good little lad. By the way I have some cheese for your whine from the last post.  <BR>As for acting MECH...what could you possibly know of MECH? -Laughs-

Alright...for the last two weeks your God has left the little machines to whine amongst themselves but,(and here's a little hint...machines don't whine unless it's from a fucking gear ya pussies ;x) my patience wears thin.  It's time for all of you rejects to crawl back into the junkyard, stuff tampons in each other's oil pans, and go back to your utterly worthless existences.<P>If yas serve UDL well, they might even invest in routine full service maintence.<P>Fat
