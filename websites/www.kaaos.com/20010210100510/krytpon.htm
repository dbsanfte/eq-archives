                ON KRYPTON</b></font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The God toiled. 
                His pick swung again and again into the side of the mountain, 
                and the wall of stone gave way bit by bit. It was a slow and tedious 
                process forcing the earth to give up its riches.</font> </p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> The laboring 
                man really was a strange sight. There was a certain aura of strength 
                and menace about him, and yet his appearance was unremarkable. 
                He wore light armor, and an average blade hung at his side. His 
                clothes were well made, and yet certainly not extravagant. The 
                muscles that played beneath his skin were strong and solid, and 
                yet there were more like those of a worker peasant than those 
                of some great hero… and yet… and yet. There was more here than 
                there seemed to be. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> Any watchers 
                who might have puzzled at this subtle mystery would have been 
                enlightened if they could have heard the thoughts and seen the 
                sights echoing inside the man's head. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> Inside of 
                the God, the memory played of his life as it had been. He saw 
                grand circumstances, admiring crowds, revolting deaths, epic battles… 
                Oh the battles he saw - contests of guile, strength, and magic 
                that broke the earth beneath him, and shattered the sky above 
                him. He heard thousands whisper, sometimes in terror, sometimes 
                in awe, the name "False Prophet". This was no ordinary man. </font></p>

                <i>Swing, clank, thud</i><br>
                </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> The mining 
                went on as the God felt the echoes of his life in another realm 
                reverberate through him, and endured his life as it was now. For 
                this was a new world. The False Prophet had fled the land he had 
                been in at the last moments as it had crumpled in on itself, destroying 
                everything forever, and had traveled to this one. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> And now 
                he was here. A bland, tedious place called Sosaria. When he had 
                first arrived, his new body and mind had been weak, but the iron 
                will that had propelled him to greatness in world after world 
                before this still dwelt in him, ice cold, and metal hard. He knew 
                that with each new realm that he traveled to he had to begin again, 
                but it was never a daunting task to him. The ages of combat and 
                strife in world after world had made him wise, and his climb to 
                dominance in each new world had always been quick and sure, and 
                where it had been neither quick nor sure, it had always been exciting.

                <i>Swing, clank, thud</i><br>
                <br>
                The sound of the pickaxe continued. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> This world 
                was different, though. When he had first arrived, he had inhaled 
                deeply of the air, and felt the familiar rush of legends waiting 
                to be written. But now that he had been here for some time, he 
                knew the truth. This world was NOT a world of heroes and gods, 
                emperors and priest-kings. No, this was a world of miners and 
                tailors. He had come to learn that the physics of this world did 
                not permit the grand excesses of his past lives. He could not 
                rise to a position of dominance here, because this was a world 
                of balance. Each expenditure of great power required that you 
                first expend the effort and the money to produce it. In this world 
                gaining the fuel to expend in titanic wars meant weeks of labor 
                for every minor clash. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> But this 
                was not right. When he had obtained a sense of how this world 
                worked, it felt instinctually wrong to him. The gods who created 
                worlds did not do so for the sake of balance and economics. They 
                created them for their amusement! For the doing of great deeds, 
                and the clashing of great armies! They created worlds to look 
                down on as the beings that inhabited them mustered all of their 
                might and burned themselves away in flashes of glory. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> And yet 
                here in this world, no one burned in a flash of glory, instead 
                they just grew gradually smaller as the demands of obtaining power 
                sanded them away. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> When he 
                realized this, the God took himself to a quiet and deep cave and 
                closed his eyes. He meditated, and in a magical state of trance, 
                he began to hear the words and intentions of the gods who had 
                created this world. It was true! As obscene as it was, no greatness 
                could be obtained here. The laws of this world demanded that so 
                much time be spent in honest labor that conquest was merely a 
                hobby practiced on weekends after long days of work. And the gods 
                had meant to do it! </font></p>
              <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><i>Swing, 
                clank, thud</i> </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> The God 
                began to regret ever coming here. He could sense no hope for this 
                world, and like other stagnant lands before this one, he could 
                see its future. The strong would migrate away to better lands 
                where their energy and ambition would lead to becoming lords of 
                the realm rather than leading to a need to become a peasant. Meanwhile 
                the weak would stay here, secure in their familiarity, and yet 
                slowly dying off. In the not-too-distant future this would be 
                a cold dark world. And the God would not be here to see it. That 
                much he vowed. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> This world 
                would change, or he would find better. With that in mind, he began 
                to plan a journey to the temples of the gods who had created this 
                world, where he had decided he would offer up a prophecy. Not 
                a prayer, for the God prayed to no being, man nor god, but a prophecy. 
                He would tell these gods their future, and they would either listen 
                and prosper, or ignore him and whither and die. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> The God 
                turned, his resolve strong, and took two steps down the road. 
                Then he remembered… no one in this gray and depressing world could 
                do anything without first doing the work. He set aside his adventurer's 
                nature and closeted the desire he felt to rush out and live life, 
                and instead he started the preparations for his long and boring 
                journey to come. </font></p>
