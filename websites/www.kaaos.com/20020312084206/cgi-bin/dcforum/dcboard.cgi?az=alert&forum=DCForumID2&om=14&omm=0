	Deep within the KAAOS citidel in the Lavastorm mountains lies the Well of Souls.. where the victims of the gods of KAAOS's souls are placed for eternal torture and for the entertainment of KAAOS. In the Well's existance, there have only been a handful of times where a soul found the wherewithall to escape back into the realms of the living..and what is to follow is one of those rare occasions..

	Much like the interdimensional limbo known as the Abyss (where the traditional laws of physics, ect. generally dont apply), each soul in the well appears to each other the way they were last seen in life, minus the physicality of substance. Somehow, among the eternal confusion of the countless souls gathered by KAAOS over the years intermingling in sorrow and eternal pain, 2 unique, yet very similar souls have found each other again and have seperated themselves to an extent from the insanity. 

	 "Man, we outdid ourselves this time Tito..This may be one mess we might not be able to get out of. We're dead fer cryin out loud...Killed by a friggin novice to boot..OK, he may have had my powers, and a fair share of my memories, but he literally had no practice in using those abilities..." 

	"And to think everyone considers me the dark, brooding one.. This isnt you Thorn, isnt you at all..There may be a way.."

	"A way out of here? The only way even one of us might get out is...Tito, you aren't suggesting what I think you're suggesting...are you? 

	"Thorn, think about how we ended up here... Mohdri used 'your' power against you. But we both know that had you were at full power, Innorruk never would have gotten that portion of it in the first place. And unless you reclaim what is rightfully yours, neither of us will get out of here and we'll rot for eternity like these poor souls. Damnit Thorn, without that piece of your soul that you willingly gave to me that day.. I wouldnt be here, our home would've been destroyed, and I'm not sure you would have been the same afterward. Only with all the pieces of your  self intact would you stand a chance against Mohdri..And its not like you're getting rid of me...every time you look in the mirror, i'll be staring back at you. It just won't be the way you've gotten used to over the years." 

(Note for those unfamiliar with the characters:: in the first story I wrote, must be close to 5 years ago now, Thorn's original homeland before he came to Neverwinter was under attack by those he had defeated before his arrivial in the Sword Coast. To protect his home and those who depended on him for thier defense, he used a variation of the M:Tg spell Clone, imparted this being with a piece of his soul and close to 1/2 his power. That's why I've always referred to them as more then twins.)

	"I understand Tito..and you're right..it is the only chance. Let's do it."

	Slowly, mythodically, Thorn began a singsong mantra what was very much unlike the magicks and enchantments most who practiced the arts arcane on Norrath understood, and ever so slowly Thorn and Titokhan's souls began to merge. In his castle in the Plane of Hate, Innorruk heard the mantra and smiled. 'It's about time those two figured it out' the Prince of Hate sneered as the mantra's pace slowly began to build. 'I thought I could control the little bastrard by only partially corrupting the brewmasters soul as i bound him to Mohdri. But I underestimated the full scope of the power i had bound to him, especially when he obtained the rest of it. What I didnt tell him was he didnt know all there was to know about the Drumheller brothers, even though Thorn's soul was bound to him.' Within a few short minutes, the mantra was heard throughout the dimensional ether, where in the limbo known as the Abyss, the corpses of both Thorn and Titokhan Drumheller and thier weapons of choice vanished into mist. Meanwhile an ominous set of stormclouds began to build over the KAAOS Citadel as well as an eerie red light could be seen eminating from the Well of Souls by the slaves with not enough sense to wander past the eternally damned room that housed the well. 

	The mantra came to an abrupt end at the same time a massive bolt of lightning surged from the stormclouds and struck at the Citadel with enough force that should have reduced even such a place as that to smoldering stone, though the impact was felt throughout Norrath. When the smoke cleared, the citadel was merely scorched, but it was not the bolt's intended target, it was something inside the citadel. Roaming the Western Commonlands of Freeport, Mohdri was in the mist of a pitched battle with a small horde of critters. And while he couldn't place the mantra, at the precise moment the lightning bolt struck the citadel, he doubled over in pain, clutching at his face as it felt like it was on fire. As quickly as the pain had come though, it vanished just as suddenly. It proved but a momentary distraction, as he proceeded to dispatch the critters. But as he healed his wounds and attempted to meditate to regain the mana spent in the battle, he couldn't maintain his concentration as ringing, manicial laughter filled his mind in an eerily familiar voice. It was a voice he was sure he knew from somewhere, so Instead of continuing his hunting, he used what little mana he had left to cast a gate to return to the Citadel.

    Said laughter could also be heard ringing throughout the Citadel as a very corporeal hand reached up from the Well's depths to grab for purchase at the top of the Well. In short order, the figure had fully emerged. He was of average height and build for someone who appeared to be in his late twenties, though as always, appearances are decieving.
