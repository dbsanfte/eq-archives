<FONT SIZE=3D2 Color = #ef0000><P>KAAOS is unlike most Guilds in its recruitment
 of members.  You must be "sponsored" into the Guild by a current member.
 This means you must "catch our attention" on-line and either ask to be
 sponsored (in game, via email, or on our boards), or a Guild member will
 ask if you'd like to be sponsored.  A brutal display of violence and
 depravity is highly recommended to get the necessary attention.  We don't
 care about weak or limp requests for guild admittance.  They won't be
 acknowledged.</P>

<P>What we DO care about is the vicious driving burn to dominate.  We care
 about the vile, profane, obscene desire to pervert and torture the world. 
 Your PVP skills and/or evil role-play ability will be the determining
 factors in your worthiness to be KAAOS. Once you are sponsored, you will be
 contacted for the next phase of admittance, to see if you have the merit
 (and stomach! or spleen!) to be KAAOS! We take great pride in being the
 best PVP'ers in the Realms, and having some of the best evil role players
 the lands have ever known. If you are unwilling or unable to be proficient
 in both, go the fuck away and join a wuss guild. Quantity of members is not
 our primary concern.</P>
