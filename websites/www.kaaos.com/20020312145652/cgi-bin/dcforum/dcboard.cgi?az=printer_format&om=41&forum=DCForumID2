<blockquote>Spite woke in a sweat. His pulse raced and chest burned. It was time. Once again the price for his ancient life must be paid. In the course of the last century, the years had seemed like months, the months became hours. He cursed at the need. Immortality was at his fingertips; yet it had managed to cruelly elude him.<P>He moved to the far wall of his chambers. The secret passage opened to his touch. Spite moved swiftly down the poorly lit passageway. The stairs were slick with moss, their rare use apparent. The silence was thick as he proceeded into the depths of the keep. He emerged into the dungeon area and the silence was broken. Moans could be heard emanating from several cells. The tormented souls had little left but their voices. <P> Spite proceeded to the third door on the left. The shocked guards stammered their greetings. He dismissed them without  recognition. As he entered a different sound filled the air. Some of the babies were feeding on the wet nurses he provided, others slept. As he scanned the faces he could identify immediately their varied origins. Some had come when their villages had been taken, other were the bastard offspring of the keeps inhabitants. It mattered little; they all shared a purpose.<P>He closed his eyes, his senses reaching out searching for the chosen one. A baby let out a horrific cry from the corner. Spite smiled, the choice had been made. He moved to the baby with silent resolve. The child looked up into his eyes and immediately stopped her crying. Spite picked up the child and placed her on the floor beside her straw bed. He caressed the young girls head once, before dashing it into the stone floor.<P>Spite moved with a quick precision, he did not have time to enjoy the look of terror on the babes face. With a swift swipe of his blade he gutted her from chin to stomach. He immediately plunged his hands under her ribcage and pulled firmly yet gently. The cracking indicated a clean break. Spite ripped her ribcage apart careful not to pierce the still beating heart. Hastily he secured her life source and tore it from the chest cavity. <P>Muttering the ancient cant, as he had so many times before. He fed. His sharp teeth shredded and tore the infants spirit. He gulped down the bloody offering. He savored the warm and salty pulsating delicacy. The warmth spread to his furthest limbs, his frame filled with an inhuman vigor and he loosened a blood-curdling scream. The dark powers that sustained him had been satisfied. It was as it must be. He wiped the blood and ancillary flesh from his chin. He stood slowly and stalked out of the cell.<P>Spite’s mouth formed a harsh smile. He would indeed sleep very well tonight.<P>Spite<BR>Ill Will<P></blockquote><hr><b><font size=2>Table of contents</font></b><hr>
