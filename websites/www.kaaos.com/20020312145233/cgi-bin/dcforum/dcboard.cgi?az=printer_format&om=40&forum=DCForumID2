Those who arrive in these lands with peaceful intent will be welcomed and protected under the Imperial banner. Once our Imperial cities are established, such individuals are welcome to use the various training facilities, mercantile, and taverns, available within our walls. <P>To those who seek harm or disrespect to Imperial citizens. You will be destroyed and driven from our lands through the realization of our philosophy: Ruthless aggression in the face of Adversity. <P><BR>Any who wish to negotiate terms for residing within Imperial lands must do so by presenting themselves, or their ambassador to paganpaladin@yahoo.com. There you may ask for counsel with the Emperor or his designated representative."<P>The time of chatter, and threats is near it's end. The time to tread within the fire is at hand. <BR>Serve, or be Crushed!<P>Temujin the Meek<BR>Chamberlain of the Crimson Flame<BR>THE CRIMSON EMPIRE<BR>www.crimson-empire.com<BR></blockquote><hr><b><font size=2>Table of contents</font></b><hr>
