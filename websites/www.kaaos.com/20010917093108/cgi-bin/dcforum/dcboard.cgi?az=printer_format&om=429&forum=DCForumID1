A broken leg stopping Pike? I'd think it would just mean you'd have to leave him closer to the kegs and other assorted bottles. But if you did that, he'd drink that much more than usual...even for him..;p<P><BR>Tito

Well I know what would have happened.... I would have got drunk of course then the brace would have came off and I would have been in the water and been fine for the week untill being sober the day after getting back... Ya I made the smart move and decided not to bother everyone yelling get me another drink!
