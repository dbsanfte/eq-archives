<p align="center"><em>I was once a Dark Elf Necromancer, like
every other Dark Elf that didn't want his back stabbed in a
dangerous city like Neriak.. I was hunting once in the forest of
Nektulous when I heard a series of shouts from the bridge that
spans the small river. Of course having nothing better to do at
the time, I dashed over and tried to stay out of sight; a grim
reminder nothing is safe in these lands.&nbsp; </em></p>

<p align="center"><em>I saw a small gnome, the first one I had
seen in my life!&nbsp; He was fighting some of the dragoons, and
he was winning! I couldn't believe my own eyes, the gnome was a
magician. With his pet keeping the frontlines back, he was
blowing through rank after rank of Dark Elf guards.&nbsp; He soon
finished up what was left, but from the scorch marks I could tell
he had put quite a dent in our guards numbers. He walked out to
the bridge and picked up....a small trinket.&nbsp; I couldn't
believe myself, why had he taken all the trouble for such a
worthless bauble?&nbsp; It was then he began casting a spell, and
before my eyes I saw a layer of transparent Plate mail fold over
him, he then just toddled off the bridge with his pet in tow,
back into the darkness.&nbsp;</em></p>

<p align="center"><em>I knew what I had to do then.&nbsp; I had
to have that power. Unfortunately nobody in Neriak likes a caster
- the only revered ones are those whom worship Innoruuk, like the
cleregy and necromatic order. I knew I was going to do it
anyways, no matter how painful..&nbsp; I stripped off my deathly
robes and ran back to the city, from there I moved out into the
real world after being exiled from Neriak for my practices, and
I've learned to blend with Human society, but I doubt I'll ever
be truly connected to them.&nbsp; I'll always know this power was
worth the shunning of all people. </em></p>
