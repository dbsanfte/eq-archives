<p align="center"><em>Telperion, the elder of the two trees of
Valinor from the ancient realm known as Middle Earth, had leaves
of dark green above and shining silver below. A dew of silver
light dripped from his leaves. It is said that the stars are made
from the dew of Telperion and the moon from the bloom of his last
flower. The line of White Trees are the images of Telperion and
many a forrest as sprung up in his name. Legend states that at
the end Telperion will reappear.</em></p>

<p align="center"><em>Strange things have been happening across
Norrath. A new continent is discovered, Mayong Mistmoore grows
restless, and even dragons, creatures of legends and children's
stories, have returned. Out of the mists rises a young druid
named Telperion Silverleaf. What does this mean? Is it merely
coincidence? Only time will tell.</em></p>
