<p align="center"><em>As described in the Iksar Lore Books in
Cabilis: </em></p>

<p align="center"><em>The greatest lizard to walk upon the land
was Venril Sathir of the Kunzar tribe. All that is known of his
youth was that he was a member of the ancient Kunzar Tribe. This
was during the time of division among the tribes of the Iksar. He
was said to have never been a mere broodling. He was forever a
master of combat. </em></p>

<p align="center"><em>Venril would soon slay his father and take
his rightful place as chief of the Kunzar Tribe. He led the
Kunzar on many expeditions into the ruins and wilds of Kunark. He
sought knowledge and weapons. </em></p>

<p align="center"><em>In his late youth, he find the hidden
library of the necromancer, Kotiz. He would come to open a large
book which opened into a small room. Climbing into the book he
finds a floating book. The Unholy Writ of War is it's title. Made
of Iksar skins and containing great knowledge of combat. Venril
becomes the books master. </em></p>

<p align="center"><em>Venril soon shows signs of dark knowledge.
He begins to wield the forces of the dark circle and his
knowledge of combat tactics becomes supreme. He trains his army
new tactics and even raises the bones of the fallen to fight yet
again for their master. His army grows and marches to all corners
of Kunark. </em></p>

<p align="center"><em>Venril Sathir's army is now unstoppable. He
shall soon plot the union of the entire Iksar nation. He no
longer wishes to be just Chief, but rather, Emperor. Under his
direction the four remaining tribe states of Iksar shall unite
and a new age shall dawn. </em></p>
