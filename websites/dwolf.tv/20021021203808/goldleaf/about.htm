<p>My name is Culurien Goldleaf and I am the artist of these galleries. I was born in Kelethin, city in the trees. My mother was a druid and my father was a ranger. My love for art and music showed from an early age. My parents frequently found me making up songs or drawing pictures in my spare time. Seeing my love for the arts, my parents knew that I should become a Bard. They sent me to the Bardic Academy in Kelethin when I turned 16. Once completing my basic schooling, I set out into the world, traveling across Norrath to see the world's magnificent sites.
</p>
<p>During one of my journeys, I ran into a young druid named Telperion. We are constant companions and have great plans of fun and adventure for the future.
</p>
<p>Since Telperion and I have begun traveling together we have seen many sights and met many people. One of the many people we traveled with was Khazal, the previous leader of the Hammers of Justice. Impressed by our skills and my songs, we were invited to join the guild. Flattered, we both were proud to be members of the Hammers. But as time passes, all things change. We found ouselves wandering the lands again without a guildhouse to call home. After many moons of searching we found ourselves within the halls of Sol Invictus.
There we were welcomed and made to feel part of a family again.
</p>
<p>Again the seasons pass as they have a tendency of doing. Many new realms have been discovered. I find myself filled with a strange lethargy, growing more tired with each passing day. Perhaps my existance in the realms of Norrath are limited and I shall soon pass on from this place. But not yet. Not yet.</p>
