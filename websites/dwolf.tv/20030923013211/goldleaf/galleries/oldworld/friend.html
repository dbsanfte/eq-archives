<p align="center"><em>On my way through Feerot one day, I and my
group stoped by Oggok to bank. With my friends waiting by the
entrance, I slipped on my dark elf disguise and entered the city.
On my way, I heard the most aweful noise and some Bouncers
laughing. I veered off course and went to see what all the fuss
was about. Two Ogre guards were torturing a poor armadillo!!
Being a child of the forest, I couldn't let this vile deed go any
further. As quietly as I could, I snuck up behind the Bouncers
and waited. </em></p>

<p align="center"><em>One of the Bouncers paused in his fun and
said something to his comrad. The other bouncer appeared to
disagree and they began arguing, momentarily forgetting the
armadillo. This was my chance! Quickly I slipped between the
bouncers and grabbed the poor armadillo. Seeing me about to take
off with their toy, the Bouncers roared in rage and attacked me.
I took off as fast as I could back towards my group, shouting as
I ran, &quot;Incomming!!&quot; My party was ready to battle when
I showed up with armadillo in my arms. My friends looked at me in
confusion. Telperion was about to ask me what was up when he saw
the Bouncers come into view. I went to the back of the group and
began singing my battle chants to aid our party. The battle was
short and furious. We were victorious.</em></p>

<p align="center"><em>After the fight, my group turned back to
me. Hailind, with a strange look on his face, asked, &quot;Ok,
what's with the 'dillo?&quot;</em></p>

<p align="center"><em>&quot;Those Bouncers were having their
demented fun with the poor thing,&quot; I replied. &quot;I
couldn't let them continue. Look at him. He's hurt.&quot;</em></p>

<p align="center"><em>Getting a closer look, Chaple, our cleric,
reached his hand towards the armadillo. The poor creature shrank
away from his touch. Muttering soothing words, Chaple eventually
coaxed the armadillo into letting him touch it. Chaple then
muttered a prayer and healed the poor creature. I thanked him and
we left Oggok.</em></p>

<p align="center"><em>Eventually, the armadillo grew to trust me
and my friends. After a long discussion we named him Baran, which
means &quot;golden-brown&quot; in Elvish. After a few days, Baran
looked healthy and fit to live on his own again. We rereleased
him back into the grassy area on the northern edge of the Dessert
of Ro. Though still shy of people in general, you can visit
Baran. Maybe one day after I retire from my wanderings, I can
take Baran and whatever mate he has chosen home with me. For now
he is doing just fine.</em></p>
