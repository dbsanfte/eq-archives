<p align="center"><em>Go placidly amid the noise and haste, and
remember what peace there may be in silence. As far as possible,
without surrender, be on good terms with all persons. Speak your
truth quietly and clearly; and listen to others, even to the dull
and ignorant; they too have their story. Avoid loud and
aggressive persons, they are vexations to the spirit. If you
compare yourself with others, you may become vain and bitter, for
always there will be greater and lesser persons than yourself.
Enjoy your achievements as well as your plans. Keep interested in
your own career, however humble; it is a real possession in the
changing fortunes of time. Exercise caution in your business
affairs, for the world is full of trickery. But let this not
blind you to what virtue there is; many persons strive for high
ideals, and everywhere life is full of heroism. Be yourself.
Especially do not feign affection. Neither be cynical about love;
for in the face of all aridity and disenchantment it is as
perennial as the grass. Take kindly the counsel of the years,
gracefully surrendering the things of youth. Nurture strength of
spirit to shield you in sudden misfortune. But do not distress
yourself with dark imaginings. Many fears are born of fatigue and
loneliness. Beyond a wholesome discipline, be gentle with
yourself. You are a child of the universe no less than the trees
and the stars; you have a right to be here. And whether or not it
is clear to you, no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should.
Therefore be at peace with God, whatever you conceive Him to be.
And whatever your labors and aspirations, in the noisy confusion
of life, keep peace with your soul. With all its sham, drudgery
and broken dreams, it is still a beautiful world. Be careful.
Strive to be happy. <br>
