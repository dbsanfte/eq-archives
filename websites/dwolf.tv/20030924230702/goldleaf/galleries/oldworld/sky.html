<p align="center"><em>From the worlds core, the rock children
rose,<br>
Shielded from wurms eyes by dirt and stone. <br>
With gnarled hands and broken bones. <br>
They carved their place into Veeshan's Home.<br>
Soon after, the woodlands and deserts and swamps,<br>
All nurtured life planted, by interloping Gods, <br>
Veeshan left her children, in peaks carved by her claws, <br>
Turned her back on Norrath, and her fellow Gods laws. <br>
The Crystalline Dragon content in her lair, <br>
Sealed off the Sky and still slumbers there. <br>
Some dragons went mad, apart from their queen,<br>
Others took charge and formed a wurm Ring. <br>
The rebels were hunted and sent from the peaks, <br>
To dwell in the lands inhabited by the weak. <br>
One of these rebels, a lady white as snow, <br>
Swept up a shard of a nature unknown. <br>
As years dragged on one by one the wurms fell,<br>
Into a deep slumber from what no one could tell, <br>
Their magic had faded, because of the shard? <br>
Or perhaps from the magic they call Veeshans Veil.<br>
Now a new verse to this legend I'll share, <br>
In regards to the Sky and what is happening there,<br>
Veeshan still slumbers, the veil has worn thin, <br>
The Wurm Queens neglect wakes her children again.</em></p>

<p align="center"><em>My song is done, but I will warn you to
heed the words of my verse for they speak the truth. Mortals now
visit where Veeshan slumbers, and only dragons once dwelled, but
the door to Sky is not a one way portal. There is much to learn
from the great Wurms, and much to fear.</em></p>
