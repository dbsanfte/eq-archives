<em>In the cold northern part of Antonica, Young Inflictx was learning the ways of a Shaman, set and determined to get the "Spear of Fate" that his shaman teacher spoke about. Only the strongest Shaman will receive this spear. Later Inflictx went to the tundra, and began practicing his skills. Not contacting any one for days... 
</em></p>
<P><em>     He found himself fighting a woolly Mammoth, snow flung in his face, not able to see. The Mammoth gored his face hitting his eye, then the Mammoth died from the poison Inflictx had casted before the blow. Knocked Unconscious and left for dead. 
    Four hours later, Hippin Chaindog was tracking for mammoths and he stepped on the half covered body of Inflictx. He was able to get the wounded shaman back to Halas, saving his life. 
     </em></p>
<p><em>    When Inflictx woke up he was met by his new friend.  Later that month.... Hippin brought Inflictx to meet his brother.  Bladez Chaindog, a Halfling rogue, taught Inflictx the ways of the Chaindog. An elite fighter, Bladez taught him the ways of being good at meleeing things.  Equipped with a Granite Face Grinder, doing that Grinding the face of enemies. Inflictx gained money, experience, respect, Wisdom and a power to be reckoned with. 
</em></p>
</em></p>Years later... 
</em></p>
<p><em>Inflictx was on his way to Bladez, which was an Outlaw now. Many rogues were outlaws in this day of age.  As Inflictx grew closer to Bladez's hideout, he saw in this telescope that Bladez had some company.  A group of five bounty hunters were attacking Bladez. When Inflictx got there he saw two of the five bounty hunters downed. Inflictx joined Bladez, finishing off one more hunter when Inflictx was Entranced by the last bounty hunter, Weasal.  A "bounty chanter," he was powerful at the skill.  Inflictx could do nothing, but watch this battle.  Bladez rushes in for the quick kill.  Enchanters not being armored are just a target for rogues, but this enchanter was a skilled one. Entrancing Bladez and recasting it on Inflictx he worked Bladez down and down. Getting the kill shot on Bladez and taking his mask, then gating. "You have won this battle, but you don't know what you have started." Painz was born, Inflictx Painz, Shaman of the Tribunal, and Revenge in his Eye for Bladez.
