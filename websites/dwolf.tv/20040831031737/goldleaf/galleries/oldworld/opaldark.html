<p align="center"><em>As fate had it, Darkhen Blakstaf was
passing through East Commons one afternoon when he caught sight
of a young enchantress being persued by ghouls. Seeing the damsel
in some distress, he rushed to her aid. Together, spells sizzling
through the air, the tide of battle begin to turn. The vile
undead were vanquished! Victorious, the Erudite turned to thank
her rescuer. As she gazed into his eyes her words of thanks died
on her lips. It was love at first sight. Finally breaking the
silence, Darkhen asked the girl her name. </em></p>

<p align="center"><em>&quot;Etherealopal,&quot; she replied
shyly. </em></p>

<p align="center"><em>&quot;A rare gem,&quot; he said, his heart
in his eyes, &quot;and most beautiful.&quot;</em></p>

<p align="center"><em>Together they traveled far and wide,
meeting new people and having adventures, until finally
Etherealopal could stand it no longer. She turned to face Darkhen
and gave him a very penetrating look. Finally she asked,
&quot;Will you marry me?&quot;</em></p>

<p align="center"><em>Surprised, Darkhen just stared at her.
Finally regaining his ability to talk, he firmly stated,
&quot;YES!!&quot;</em></p>

<p align="center"><em>He then swept her up in his arms where they
kissed deeply. Afterwards, then and there, they exchanged vows
that forever joined thier souls together so that even though
circumstances and miles might separate them, they shall be
together always. </em></p>
