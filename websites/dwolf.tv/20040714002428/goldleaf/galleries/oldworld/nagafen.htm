<p align="center"><font size="4"><em><u>Lord Nagafen</u></em></font></p>

<p align="center"><em>It is said that outside of space and time
an entity knows only as the Nameless, exists, and that this being
created all that there is and was and will be. It is also written
in ancient texts that from His mind sprang not only the universe
and its countless suns and worlds, but also a myriad of sentient,
powerful, yet finite creatures whom one such as man, or elf, or
dwarf, would call a god.</em></p>

<p align="center"><em>In aeons past came one of these gods upon
the world of Norrath, Veeshan, Crystalline Dragon and ruler of
the Plane of Sky, found this world pleasing and deposited her
brood onto the frozen continent of Velious. With one swipe of Her
mighty claws, Veeshan opened several great wounds upon the
surface world. Dragons then walked the land and flew the skies,
powerful beings of great intellect, wisdom, and strength.</em></p>

<p align="center"><em>In time, other gods noticed Veeshan's work.
Being petty and jealous, they too came upon Norrath, intent upon
leavig their mark.* Thus the other races were born.</em></p>

<p align="center"><em>As time continues its steady march onward,
Veeshan and her brood began to disappear and the peoples of
Norrath began to forget about them. Dragons became nothing more
than myth and legends, stories mothers tell their children in
order to scare them into obediance. But lately, it has been
rumored that the humans have found two such creatures exist on
Antonica; one near the Barbarian homeland in the north and a
second in the wasteland of Lavastorm Mountians. Many adventurers
and glory seekers have gone in search of these fantastical
beasts. Even the great bard Selos himself went to search out
these beasts, never to return. When I got word of a dragon
hunting party forming, I had to join up.</em></p>

<p align="center"><em>We all met in the Lavastorm druid circle,
where many were porting in from all across Norrath to join in the
hunt. Never had I seen such a gathering of people! Once all were
gathered our leader, Goram, instructed us to get into groups so
we could begin the hunt. After a little confusion, everyone got
grouped together and we entered the second half of Solesek's Eye,
a place called Nagafen's Lair.</em></p>

<p align="center"><em>I myself have been in Nagafen's Lair
before, but only the upper most levels. Once we went through the
bat caves, I became disoriented, following those who knew where
they were going. We paused to regroup in a huge spider lair and
discussed our strategies on dealing with the fire giants that
guard the dragon. It was decided that two brave monks would pull
the giants out a few at a time, so we could split them up, and we
continued deeper into the Lair.</em></p>

<p align="center"><em>We came to a bridge spanning a river of
lava and it was there that I saw my first fire giant. Though I
have seen other giants, I was unprepaired for the sight before
me. These giants were more fleshy than I had thought they would
be, expecting some beast made of pure flames, but they could walk
through the lava unharmed. In fact, it actually seemed to heal
them! Our leader shouted, &quot;CHARGE!&quot; and we all ran
across the bridge to fight the giantkin. </em></p>

<p align="center"><em>We faught wave upon wave of the giants,
getting short rests in between the battles for healing and
meditation. At some point the fire giant King attacked us. I must
have been concentrating on weaving two songs together when I was
hit and stunned by the King! The king must not have liked my
music, because he kept hitting me, attempting to flatten me into
the earth. Our cleric came to my rescue, healing me to full
health, and the King turned his attention elsewhere, and I began
singing again with a passion. Eventually, the King and his guards
fell. I thought for sure that the rest of the giants would be
disheartened at us killing their King, but they only became more
enraged and attacked us with renewed strength.The fire giant Magi
was furious and began shouting out names, summoning people so he
could kill them. Yet, with all his magic, the Magi still fell and
our hopes were lifted.</em></p>

<p align="center"><em>We finished off the last few giants and
then sat down to begin a long buffing process. Here, the the
clerics, shaman, a couple druids, necros, and us bards broke
apart from our current groups and regrouped together, forming a
semicircle. Temlin the shaman took over as leader, calling people
one by one to receive the spells necessary and then were told to
camp and wait for everone else to join them. The process was
long, but well organized. When every last person had received
their spells, everyone broke camp and we disbanded our group.
Then each cleric was instruced to form new groups in which we
would face the Dragon. Though a little confusing, everyone was
sorted out and into groups. Finally, one of our clerics,
Inspiration, lead us in a prayer to the Gods for the strength to
defeat the great evil before us. That done, we all gathered
before the last door that blocked us from our goal. There was no
turning back. It was now or never. My heartbeat racing, calmly
Goram walked up to the door and opened it......and the one they
call Lord Nagafen was waiting.</em></p>

<p align="center"><em>The fightertypes rushed foreward sceaming
battle cries. Mages and necros sent their summoned pets in.
Wizards began casting their dread spells. Clerics and druids
readied their healing powers. I too began to move forward,
singing songs to help my party resist the dragons dread magic,
but I could only stop and stare in awe at Lord Nagafen's
magnificance. He was as beautiful as we was aweful. Scales the
color of blood and flames protected his gargantuan body better
than any forged armor ever could. Like ants we must appear to his
eyes, tiny and insignificant. Then he turned his attention on us
and I felt the will of a dragon for my first time. Many, myself
included, turned and fled as we felt the first wave of dragon
fear. Those few unaffected began hacking at the beast. Even as I
ran in fear, I could hear as the beast unleashed his devistating
breath weapon and the screams of the dying. Finally, the fear
wore off and those of us who had ran turned back to rejoin the
fight.</em></p>

<p align="center"><em>The fight was short and ugly. Fighters gave
up any semblance of form and style and literally hacked away. The
dragon unleashed fearsome magics and his devistating breath
weapon over and over while our own casters retaliated with their
own spells. I was able to shrug off most of the magics aimed at
me, after experiencing them the first time, and kept singing
until I thought I would go hoarse. My hopes rose as it looked
that the dragon would go down. But something was wrong. Though
the dragons was severly hurt, our casters were running out of
mana to cast their spells. Lord Nagafen, sensing our weakness,
began to summon people to him so he could kill them easier. Not
giving up, our forces attacked with renewed vigor. Nagafen
snarled in fury and cast even worse spells than before, ones even
I couldn't resist. I felt my health start to drain away and I
tried to walk back to our cleric. Before I could get to relative
safety, Nagafen himself reached out a claw and slashed me. My
legs gave out on me and I fell.</em></p>

<p align="center"><em>When I came to, my group's cleric was
leaning over me, pouring life back into my body. I weakly got up
and began to gather my things together, singing softly to help
the cleric regain mana easier, and I looked around. Signs of the
fighting was everywhere. Scorch and claw marks on the floor and
walls; the smell of herbs used as reagents; even the air vibrated
with the left over energies from all the spell casting. Many were
wounded like I had been, bodies lying mangled in heaps. The
healers had their work cut out for them. And there was rejoicing
for the dragon had fallen! I looked around again and was worried.
If the dragon had truely fallen, where was the body? It was
nowhere to be found. Had Nagafen truely died or had he just fled
to return another day? I shruged unknowingly, only time would
tell, and went to join those going though the dragon's hoard. </em></p>

<p align="center"><em>It is with great sadness that I report that
we have finally some clue as to what happened to the bard Selo.
Mixed in the dragons treasure was Selo's Drums. Did this mean he
met an untimely end as a dragon's dinner? Or had the bard, in his
fright, dropped his treasured drums in an effort to escape and
still lives somewhere? I returned home after the fighting with
little answers and more questions that when I started. I have to
believe that the rumors of a dragon near the barbarian homeland,
who is known as Lady Vox, are as true as this one was. But what
of one of the greatest bards in history? Perhaps one day my
questions will be answered. Until then, I shall keep looking.</em></p>
