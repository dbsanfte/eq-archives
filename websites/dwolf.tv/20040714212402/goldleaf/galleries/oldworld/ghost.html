<p align="center"><em>As described in the Iksar Lore Books in
Cabilis: </em></p>

<p align="center"><em>Talon Southpaw was the fastest pugilist
ever to walk within the Court of Pain. His speed rivaled that of
the great Grandmaster Tynn. He could often be found within the
local taverns demonstrating the awesome speed of his fist. </em></p>

<p align="center"><em>Talon Southpaw came to rebirth within this
caste. Although quick with fist and tail, the speed of his left
arm was not to come to blossom for a couple decades past his
rebirth. It was to follow his captivity by the accursed Samak. </em></p>

<p align="center"><em>Soon after fulfilling the Rung of Tynn,
Talon went on a wandering retreat into the dangerous outlands of
Kunark. He was not seen from for a total of 5 seasons. Upon his
return to Cabilis he told of his captivity within an ancient city
of Iksar now claimed by the Samak. He told of intense torture. He
survived the ordeal. He escaped from the claws of the Samak with
numerous scars which proved of his painful ordeal. Most of the
worst scars were never to be seen. Talon worn a robe which he
never removed. The scars underneath were for no lizards eyes. his
great perseverance gave him an inner strength no other monk could
lay claim to. </em></p>

<p align="center"><em>He now possessed incredible, almost
blinding speed with his left arm. He could tap a foes arm with
his left and strike with as if having a third arm! He was indeed
a paragon of the Swifttails. All the empire under respected or
feared him. None would spar him outside of the taverns. with grog
comes stupidity. </em></p>

<p align="center"><em>Upon his death in Kurn, Grandmaster Tynn
removed his hands in a private ceremony. Only Tynn was allowed to
gaze upon Talon's body. The fists were then sealed in a canopic
which would stay within the Tower of Kurn. His body was dusted.
This is his tale as told by Rinmark. </em></p>
