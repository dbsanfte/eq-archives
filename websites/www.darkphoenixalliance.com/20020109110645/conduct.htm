<b><FONT size=+1>Code of Conduct</font></b>
<p>

<P>
<b>I. Grouping policy</b></br>
The idea of a guild is brotherhood and companionship, with that in mind you are encouraged to group with guild members at any time that an opportunity shows itself.  This means that if a guild member of grouping level comes into the zone and is looking for a group try to see if there is a way for you to hunt together. If your group has room invite your guildmate to join.  It would be terrible to have a member stranded while another member is in the zone.  
<P>

<b>II. Aiding guild members</b></br>
We understand that there are times when power leveling is acceptable but in most cases it is not. We do want a high level guild but what we don't want is a high level low skill level guild. With that said though, if a fellow guild member is in real need of help it is your duty to offer any assistance you can.  This does not mean that clerics have run all over the place resurrecting people nor does it mean that you have to play taxi for your fellow guildmates.  What this does mean is use GOOD JUDGEMENT when someone asks for help.  Just remember there could come a time when you need help as well.
<P>

<b>III. Language conduct</b></br>
The guild does not condone or accept members using profanity in any manner. This is not a respectable method of communication.  We want our guild to be honorable and it is difficult to convince outsiders that we are an honorable people when our tongues are not. 
<P>

<b>IV. Do not abuse the forums</b></br>
The forums are to be used for questions, answers, feedback, congratulatory posts and anything requested by the guild members. There will be NO slandering of anyone in any way. If there is a problem please report it to an officer of the guild and not post it in the forums. This is a meeting place for the guild and NOT a place for public humiliation, slandering or harassment. 
<P>

<b>V. Always act honorable</b></br>
If we truly wish to show how honorable we are then we must always act honorable. If you act dishonorable you will never be able to convince the citizens of Norrath that we are a great guild. With this said please keep the following in mind.<br>
<table cellpadding=5>
<tr>
<td>
<table>
<tr>
<td>
a. <u>Do not beg</u><br>
If someone is to gift you with something may it be out of respect and not out of pity. The field of battle holds much valor and riches. One cannot find such things by begging.

<tr>
<td>
b. <u>Do not kill steal</u><br>
This can happen by accident sometimes, if it does it is expected of you to handle the situation carefully. First apologize in /ooc if necessary, then take the conversation into tells. The last thing we want to see is an argument break out where bad words are exchanged and the member of the guild looks bad, as does the guild he/she represents.

<tr>
<td>
c. <u>Do not spam</u><br>
Do not continuously shout or repeat in any channel for any reason. Even if you are selling make sure there is a reasonable period of time before you repeat your message. No one likes to be "spammed".

<tr>
<td>
d. <u>Stay in character</u><br>
No matter how much you disagree, this game is an RPG. You need to respect that and should always be in character. We want to have a reputation for excellence and staying in character will help that.
</table>
</table>
<P>

<b>VI. Wear your guild tag</b></br>
You are in the guild, be proud of it! You should always have your Dark Phoenix Alliance tag showing. If you want to conceal your other information use the /roleplaying command.  Never use the /anon command which conceals everything.
<P>

<b>VII. Need before Greed</b></br>
Just as the phrase dictates we must be mindful of who needs the loot we find and who just wants it for money. If you find yourself in a group where something drops, take a look around. Ask yourself who can use it. If there are one or two people who could truly use it speak up and tell everyone that need before greed is the way to go. If some in your party is greedy and believe that all should roll even if just for financial gain then roll and give it to those who can truly use it. Show honor above all else!
<P>

<b>VIII. Participation</b></br>
Everyone should attend raids and guild meetings.  Not all will be able to attend at all times but it is your participation that will either make or break our guild.   Participation in activities is what helps to bring us together and to have fun.  This participation also means visiting the guild website frequently and sending in suggestions.  Continuous lack of communication or participation can lead to removal from the guild. We want you to participate! This is what it means to be in the guild.
<p>


<b>IX. Request aid and quest officially</b></br>
This is very important. If you want help with a quest you need to request it directly through the forums.  This way everyone is given a chance to participate, group and have fun. Refrain from trying to start camping quests through /guildtalk.  
<p>
<b>X. Raid loot guidelines</b></br>
The following guidelines will be followed when a guild wide raid event occurs.<br>
1. All PP is divided among all participates in the raid. If they had to leave the game for some reason they will receive their share upon their return.
<p>
2. All items will be sold (either to vendors or via auction) to be converted to PP except items, deemed by the officers on hand or before the raid, that are of "unique" magical nature.
<p>
3. All unique magical items will be lotto'ed at the end of the raid. Everyone may roll for an item including the council.  The officer in charge may roll once for himself and make one roll that represents the council's roll.  Items that the council wins will be used as awards or in other capacities that the council deems fit. You or the council are only allowed to win one item.  If you win an item then decide you would prefer to roll on another item you must return your previous winnings if you WIN the new item.  The returned items will then become available again for all to roll for.  All though everyone may roll for an item we encourage you not to roll for an item only for financial gain.  Other may be in the group that can use that item then and there without having to trade or sell it.
<p>
4. You must attend and participate in the raid for more then an hour to be eligible for the loot.
<p>
5. These guidelines apply to guild wide raids only. People participating in any other events will determine their own guidelines at that time. It is suggested that a "Need before greed" be observed when ever possible.
