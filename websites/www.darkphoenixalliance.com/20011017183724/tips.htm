Did you know that if you have upgraded your EQ to the Velious expansion that you are able to view your inventory in full screen.  Before the expansion came out if you played in full screen mode and wanted to see your inventory your display switch back to the small screen mode.

<b><LI>Add an emote or message to an action</b><br>
If you want to add an emote or custom message to an action (casting a spell or using a skill) you will need to creat a HOT KEY.  Below is an example to use on how to creat a hot key to send a custom message to your group that you are casting a heal spell on John Doe.<P>

1st line: /g Incoming heal %T<br>
2nd line: /cast 8<br>
<p>
Your group members would see the following in group chat if John Doe was targeted.
<P>
Incoming heal John.
<P>
The second line in the hot key cast what ever spell is in the 8th gem slot.  In this case it was a heal spell.
