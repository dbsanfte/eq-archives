<b>Guild Raid Policies</b>
<table>

<tr>
<td><li>The officer in charge of the raid will appoint group leaders prior to the raid.

<tr>
<td><li>Only group leaders should use guild chat during the raid. All other chatting should be done in group chat or private tells.  This insures that there is no cross communication.  It also allows other group leaders to coordinate attacks as well as respond to distress signals from other group leaders.

<tr>
<td><li>There will be no rushing in and attacking.  This is not an acceptable tactic. Many raids have failed as a result of someone rushin in and aggro'ing a whole zone.  Just because many of us are there doesn't mean we are invincible. 

<tr>
<td><li>Tardiness - unless prior notification has been made to the raid leaders, anyone attending a raid late will be place in an open group.  If there is no open spot, they will be allowed to wait until one becomes available. Obviously we all have obligations that will make us late from time to time. So please make sure to notify the raid leader or an officer immediately upon learning of your status.

<tr>
<td><li>Raids are usually held to obtain a certain goal.  If you attend a raid you may or may not get experience.  If at that time you feel you are not having fun because of the lack of experience, you may leave at any time.  There will be no hard feelings.  But if you do choose to leave please do so at a time that does not disrupt the rest of the attending member's enjoyment.

<b>Raid Tactics</b>
<table>
<tr>
<td><li><b>Assist Command</b> - using of the assist command is a major must know how.  Eventually we will have members who are useful in crowd control.  In crowd control situations it is important that everyone in the group only attack the mob that the puller is attacking.  This way the crowd control players are able to do their magic and not have it dispel by their own group members.  It is also important that the puller makes sure not to change target, if at all possible, while in the middle of a conflict.

<tr>
<td><li>Healing - If you are being attacked and are low on health pull away for the fight.  If you are being chased and are in need of healing do not run away from the group.  It is very hard for the healing members to target you if you are out of range.  Instead of retreating in a straight line, away from the group, try to run in wide circles around the healers of your group.  This will enable them to target and heal you.  At the same time it will enable other members of the group to try and pick off the enemies that are chasing you.

</table>
<P>
If everyone follows these policies and use the suggested tactics it will help insure that we have fewer deaths during a raid.  This in turn will help make for a more successful and fun raid for everyone.
