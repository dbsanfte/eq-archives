<I>Dark Phoenix Alliance is a guild of friendship and fun. We are not by any means a power gaming or twinking guild. The intention of the guild is to provide a haven for those involved where one can communicate and lounge. We do have rules that we expect members to follow but they are not that demanding. We believe in loyalty, to both the guild and to the individual, and try to recruit people that agree with that concept. We try to keep things within the guild friendly, low-key and fun.</I></FONT>
