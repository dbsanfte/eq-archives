          here</a>. I have attempted to contact TedtheChanter in order to get 
          official permission to use this post, however have not been able to. 
          Please<a href="mailto:juweleq@icqmail.com"> contact me</a> if there 
          is problem posting this information.</p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p>1. Faction in Everquest</p>
          <p>The faction system is the relation ship between YOU, the player character, 
            and the AI controlled creatures of Norrath.</p>
          <p>The word faction has two common meanings:</p>
          <p>Faction(1): noun. An associated group of NPCs, Identified by thier 
            faction number and a faction description. An example of this would 
            'Faction 232', or 'ClawsofVeeshan'.</p>
          <p>Faction(2): noun. The relative relationship between you and any given 
            creature as given by the /con command in game. An example of this 
            would be 'Lord Nagafen scowls at you, ready to attack'.</p>
          <p>For the sake of clarity, I will use CONSIDER whenever I mean faction(2) 
            and FACTION whenever I mean faction(1) in this document.</p>
          <p>Important things to realize about faction:</p>
          <p>- Each AI controlled creature belongs to one and only one faction.<br>
            - The consider changes that occur when you kill a creature or do a 
            quest have NOTHING to do with the faction of the creature killed or 
            the quest giver. While often they are often similar, that similarity 
            is simply a statement of consistency in Verant's world.</p>
          <p>2. How Consider Works</p>
          <p>When you /con a creature, the Everquest server generates a number 
            that is your relative ranking of like and dislike from that creature's 
            faction. This number is composed of:</p>
          <p>A modifier for your god<br>
            A modifier for your race<br>
            A modifier for your class<br>
            A modifier for your own faction changing efforts<br>
            A modifier that is spell based<br>
            A modifier that is NPC specific<br>
            A zone modifier</p>
          <p>The sum of these modifiers is your consider number. What is output 
            by the client is one of nine messages, depending on the consider number:</p>
          <p>Below -801, scowls at you, ready to attack<br>
            -800 to -501, views you threateningly<br>
            -500 to -101, scowls at you dubiously<br>
            -100 to -1, is apprehensive<br>
            0 to 99, is indifferent<br>
            100 to 499, is amiable<br>
            500 to 699, kindly considers you<br>
            700 to 1099, views you warmly<br>
            1100 and up, you are an ally</p>
          <p>All player characters on blue servers have a base consider of 0.</p>
          <p>Consider USED to be capped at +2000 and -2000. It was changed some 
            months ago to handle larger values. There MAY still be specific caps 
            associated with certain factions, but I have not found any current 
            evidence that this is true.</p>
          <p>How do the modifers work?</p>
          <p>The GOD modifer is fixed for each faction. Worshipers of each god 
            have fixed plus or minus consider for each faction.<br>
            The RACE modifier is fixed for each faction. Each race has a fixed 
            plus or minus consider for each faction.<br>
            The CLASS is fixed for each faction. Each CLASS has a fixed plus or 
            minus for each faction.<br>
            The PERSONAL modifier is set at your character creation for each faction, 
            and is changed as a result of your in-game actions. For example, if 
            I do the Kerran Key quest in qeynos I get about +30 to my personal 
            Steel Warrior consider.<br>
            The SPELL based modifier raises the consider number a set amount per 
            spell. For example, Collaboration adds 300.<br>
            The NPC modifer overrides other considerations. For example, Gypsies 
            have a set faction based on RACE and CLASS, and GOD that cannot be 
            changed by spells.<br>
            The ZONE modifier is a set amount that is added to certain personal 
            consider values upon entering a zone. In almost all cases, the ZM 
            is zero. This information on ZM is based on two bits of sketchy information. 
            First, a vague statement from Verant that a consider ZM causes the 
            'You swipe at a %t. A %t dies' messages that appear when you zone. 
            Second, one example, that of the Kromrif, who are on the same faction, 
            yet con exactly 100 different for me in two different zones.</p>
          <p>Here is an example:</p>
          <p>I have a personal modifer of 2697 with WolvesoftheNorth. Since I 
            am a dark elf, I lose 200, since I worship Innoruuk I lose 300, but 
            since I am an enchanter I gain 100. My total faction is 2697-200-300+100, 
            or 2297, making me an ally.</p>
          <p><br>
            3. The effect of Spells on Consider</p>
          <p>(a) Invisible, camoflauge, sneak, hide, and invisible to undead set 
            your consider to 0 for NPCs who don't see through them.</p>
          <p>(b) The faction-changing enchanter spells have these effects:</p>
          <p>Alliance: +100 consider<br>
            Benevolence: +200 consider<br>
            Collaboration: +300 consider</p>
          <p>Only one instance of these spells can be alive at any time, and all 
            three spells overwrite each other.</p>
          <p>(c) Illusions affect your faction as if you actually changed to the 
            race of the illusion. This makes the server recalculate your consider 
            at a new value while you have the illusion on. The amount recalulated 
            for illusions is based on the NPC faction vs that race, not on the 
            illusion iself. That means that different illusions will produce different 
            consider results on NPCs with different faction. This is a hard concept, 
            so here is an example with two barbarian NPCS who are on different 
            faction in the same zone:</p>
          <p>Me Maula FishCatcher Maula's fisherman buddy<br>
            Human 1487 1307<br>
            Werewolf 1387 807<br>
            Dark Elf 787 707<br>
            Troll 1287 1207<br>
            Ogre 987 1207</p>
          <p><br>
            (d) Memory blur does not change faction. It just wipes the Hate List.</p>
          <p>(4) Where do consider changes come from?</p>
          <p>(a) Killing creatures. Usually killing a creature produces one or 
            more +considers and one or more -considers. The amount gotten from 
            killing varies, and I have seen values from +1 to +250 and -1 to -200. 
            Typical kill values are +/- 1 to 5.<br>
            (b) Doing quests. Each quest step usually changes consider values 
            for several factions. Typical numbers are +/-1 and +/-5. A few quests 
            produce consider changes in the +/- hundreds.<br>
            (c) Specials. Some special game items (like hailing that genii in 
            Sol B) can change consider. I don't have any large list of these, 
            and would be happy to learn about them.</p>
          <p>(5) Various topics</p>
          <p>(a) Monsters who do not see you because you are behind them, etc, 
            simply don't see you. Your consider remains the same.<br>
            (b) Charisma has no effect on consider.<br>
            (c) Factions cross continents, zone, etc. RingofScale in Permafrost 
            is the same as RingOfScale in Kunark.<br>
            (d) Factions are not interrelated. Losing consider with ServantsofMistmoore 
            does not change my MayongMistmoore consider.<br>
            (e) Your consider can be reset to base as a bug.</p>
          <p></p>
