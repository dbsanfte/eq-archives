        to Arbogast who can be found in a building beside the bank in Katta Castellum. 
        There is a lot of story background and many dialogues between you, Arbogast 
        and his friend Miller. He will tell you that Phenic Dionicas is a vampire 
        and if you wish to see the truth he will hand you Arbogast's Water Vial 
        which he wants you to throw on Phenic's face.<br>
        <br>
        Phenic can be found on the second floor of the government building. Hand 
        him the water and he will smile at you and hand you back the Phenic's 
        Water Vial. Now return to Arbogast and hand him the water and he will 
        say that the dark magics are stronger than he though.<br>
        <br>
        He will then hand you back a Silver Wrapping Container and will tell you 
        to seek out Nathyn Illuminious (who he believes is actually Tsaph Katta). 
        Retrieve Nathyn's Memoirs from the room with the locked door in his castle 
        [Pick Lock Skill: 201]. Put it in the silver wrapping container and return 
        it to Arbogast. He will then spout some nonsence on how Norrath doesn't 
        exist and that the truth must be found. </span></font> </p>
      <p class="spellltext">Follow this conversation and he'll hand you a Gold 
        Wrapping Container and will tell you to bring him a book on the Exodus. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Head off to the Shadowhaven Library and locate Rianna Birchard and ask 
        her &quot;do you know of the exodus&quot;. She will tell you that Peqi 
        borrowed it.<br>
        Peqi can be found in one of the buildings near the casters guild in Shadowhaven, 
        kill him to obtain it. Put the book in the gold wrapping container and 
        hit combine, now return it to Arbogast. He will tell you to bring him 
        two Akuel Xi Ans Vius [NO RENT] which drop in the Akheva Ruins and will 
        then hand you a Black Wrapping Paper. Once you have obtained them, place 
        them inside the paper and combine them, return once again to Arbogast.<br>
        <br>
        He and miller will head off to the bank to get some items for you... but 
        instead of handing them to you they will discuss it and then leave out 
        the front door. Now kill both Miller (Lvl 47 WAR) and Arbogast (Lvl 49 
        CLR) and you will obtain a Heavy Wrap, 2 No Rent swords, a Clasp, a Shimmering 
        Mace and some Baleen Plate. Place the Clasp in the Heavy Wrap and hit 
        combine, and you'll be left with the Cloak of Truth.</p>
