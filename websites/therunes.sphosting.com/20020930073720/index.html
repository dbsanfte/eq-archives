                  by many enchanters over the direction our class is heading with 
                  the Planes of Power Expansion. (A sentiment I agree with) There 
                  are several threads at the boards on <a href="http://forums.crgaming.com/eqbb/viewforum.php?f=9" target="_blank" class="links">CastersRealm</a> 
                  and now one concerning the fact that enchanters need to be more 
                  unified- <a href="http://forums.crgaming.com/eqbb/viewtopic.php?t=77205" target="_blank" class="links">If 
                  enchanters want to be herad...</a> The original poster hit the 
                  nail on the head, there is no one site that is considered &quot;the 
                  enchanter site&quot; While I certainly would LOVE for this site 
                  to be it, I would also gladly patronize any enchanter site that 
                  was. </p>
                <p class="regtext">In the meantme I suggest anyone who is upset, 
                  concerned about the future of Enchanters to visit <a href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/community/dev_view.jsp" target="_blank" class="links">The 
                  Developers Corner</a> and let them know your concerns.</p>
                <p class="regtext">If you are a European player, I guess you have 
                  heard the latest decision to let Ubisoft handle distrubution 
                  of POP. However, in a mind boggling twist, not only will the 
                  expansion be available to you 2 months after release, to add 
                  insult to injury you will only be able to play it on a &quot;Euro&quot; 
                  server. That's right. You will not have your choice of servers. 
                  I have yet to be able to figure out any reasoning for this. 
                  /boggle. Many European players in my alliance are placing orders 
                  now through US distributors or making other arrangments to have 
                  the &quot;real&quot; expansion shipped to them. </p>
                <p class="regtext">In addition to the zone guides I'm begining 
                  to add (yes I'm behind I know) I would also like to add a slow/mezz/charm 
                  guide. Please help me make this a complete list by sending me 
                  a list of mobs you know to be unslowable, unmezzable, or not 
                  charmable. I found out the hard way lastnight that the Dark 
                  Assasins in Umbral are NOT charmable in addition to be unmezzable. 
                  *sigh* How wish I had done this research before LOL.<br>

                <p class="regtext">Looks as though a glimpse of our post 60 spells 
                  made it to test. I decided to make a semi permanent page so 
                  we can keep track of changes as they happen. One of the most 
                  exciting spells on test is a series of Imbuing gems with basic 
                  elements. There is also a stun spell listed that decreases the 
                  mana used, increases damage done. Interesting! You can see the 
                  listing <a href="testspells.htm">here</a>, I also added a link 
                  --&gt; </p>

                <p class="regtext">Not a whole lot going on these days for the 
                  enchanter. Currently I'm working on getting more zones updated. 
                  Charkok, and Crystal Caverns should be finished soon. I'm also 
                  going to begin adding more quest information. While I had planned 
                  to do the Plane of Mischief next, it seems that the zone will 
                  soon be getting a revamp. I'll just wait a little longer and 
                  see what comes of that. <br>
                  <br>
                  I also wanted to thank all of the new visitors to the site, 
                  and thanks for the nice emails. Safe travels!<br>

                <p class="regtext">Since last patch there is currently rezz bug. 
                  You will not always get exp back. It will say you do, but the 
                  exp is not given. Be sure to double check. </p>
                <p class="linedtext">September 6, 2002</p>
                <p class="regtext"><span class="regtext">There were a couple of 
                  changes in the patch that affected enchanters. The first one 
                  being the Cast Sight line of spells. Not that big of a deal, 
                  but it's now working as it did originally. You cast it on any 
                  target, and you see from their prospective. You can then target 
                  anything in their line of vision to switch your view. </span></p>
                <p class="regtext"><span class="regtext">Now the BIG news that 
                  surprisingly little has been said about. Single mezzes are overwriting 
                  the AoE mezzes. Also we are now able to overwrite the bard mezz. 
                  This is HUGE news. For the time being at least, we are able 
                  to AOE that nasty train, then go back and single mezz at your 
                  convience. Whether or not this was intented remains to be seen. 
                  Verant has said many times that the ability to overwrite AoE 
                  with a single was not going to be in the cards for us because 
                  it would be &quot;too easy&quot; Let's cross our fingers that 
                  this was intented. </span></p>
                <p class="regtext"><span class="regtext">I recieved an e-mail 
                  today regarding pets and giving them high damage/low delay weapons. 
                  I remember waaaay back Abashi saying that pets were not subject 
                  to damage/delay bonuses. However, so many things have changed 
                  since Abashi left, but I don't recall ever seeing anything after 
                  that, so I was unable to answer the question with any certainty. 
                  That got me thinking that that would be a good area to add to 
                  the site. If you have solid information, data, any thing that 
                  you could send me I will put it together and try to get some 
                  solid information on this.<a href="mailto:Juweleq@msn.com" class="links">

                  allows you to control the density of the spell effect. The range 
                  is 0.0 - 1.0. New spell effects. WOOT. CastersRealm has a few

                  A couple of changes were made on the test server to level 59 
                  spell <span class="spellbold">Rapture</span>, and level 60 spell 
                  <span class="spellbold">Dictate</span>. Both had the magic check 
                  removed and changed to unresistable. WOOT! </p>
