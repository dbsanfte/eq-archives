                They were supposed to go on test server over the weekend, but

                I went through and began cleaning up the spell and items pages. 
                The spell pages were the first ones I did when I originally built 
                the site, and well they were pretty damned ugly. LOL<br>

                did a fairly large update on shoulder items. I included loc's

                Looks as though Wandering Mind was FINALLY fixed. It now decreases 
                mana by 6 per tick and gives it to you. Woot!<br>
                I also came across a decent <a href="http://www.power3d.com/Arch/image.asp?image=images/maps/jaggedpine_temp2.gif" target="_blank" class="links">map 
                for Jaggedpine</a>. <span class="regtext">I hope to be updating 
                the zone information tomorrow, and wil</span>l be including the 
                faction information</p>

                Forest - one of the items said to drop is a Cloak of Calm Waters 
                8ac 5wis 5int 5cha 15svm, off of Queen Nhyalia level 52. Until 
                this is a confirmed drop I wont add it to the list</span></font><span class="regtext"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, cursive, fantasy" size="2" color="#666666">.</font></span></p>
              <p class="regtext"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, cursive, fantasy" size="2" color="#666666">Also 
                confirmed is the change to Affliction focus items. Instead of 
                being limited to DOT spells, it now includes debuffs that have 
                a duration. </font></p>

              <p align="center" class="regtext"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, cursive, fantasy" size="2" color="#666666">Update 
                - Though no new items have turned up having focus effects, it 
                seems that there were changes to how the Affliction lines work. 
                It was reported at the<a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse" target="_blank"> 
                Safehouse </a>that any debuff that has a duration will now work 
                with the Allfliction focus items. This includes Tash, slows etc.</font></p>
              <p align="center" class="regtext"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, cursive, fantasy" size="2" color="#666666">Also 
                I came across a great article about Jaggedpine Forest. It was 
                written by someone on the Stormhammer server. I assume that the 
                zone was left unchanged when it became available to all servers. 
                You can read the article<a href="http://www.glorysite.com/eq/jp.html" target="_blank"> 
                here</a>. It also has some really good information for anyone 
                who is concerned about maintaining factions. </font></p>
              <p align="center" class="regtext"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, cursive, fantasy" size="2" color="#666666">A 
                few items are starting to show up from Jaggedpine Forest. Though 
                it was posted someplace that this was a low to mid level zone, 
                it's actually a mid to higher level. To get there, have a Druid 
                port you to Surefall Glade, go into the bear caves. At loc p60,n517 
                there is an orb, just click on it.<br>
                If anyone has any faction information on this zone, please <a href="mailto:juweleq@msn.com" class="underline2">contact 
                me</a> so that I may add it.</font></p>

                Big patch day! Jaggedpine Forest is now available to all servers. 
                I will be keeping an eye out for any enchanter wearable items 
                coming from there. Also some other changes that effect us.<br>

                    Resistance Changes: Pets will now use their master's level 
                    and resistances when saving against spells cast by NPCs (against 
                    PCs pets will use their own resistances and level as they 
                    always have) - unless the pet has special resistances, in 
                    which case it will use that resistance.<br>

                    Altered pet summoning spells so that they always summon the

                there are more changes coming for pets. A pet will use the owners 
                resistances when it comes to damage. Unless the pet has a higher 
                innate resistance to say fire, then it will use that. You can
