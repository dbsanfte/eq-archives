                              </span>There are huge changes taking place on the 
                              test server in an attempt to deal with &quot;overpowered&quot; 
                              charm in PoP. Unfortunately these changes will impact 
                              all charmed pets even for the 63 levels before you 
                              can scribe COD. You can find the thread on the<a href="http://therunes.proboards6.com/index.cgi?board=general&action=display&num=1048271056" target="_blank" class="links"> 
                              boards</a>.</p>
                            <p class="spellltext"> Basically instead of changing 
                              COD, VI (on test) has changed the way mobs attribute 
                              damage caused by charmed pets. Enchanters have taken 
                              pretty significant hits lately, and this is could 
                              prove to be a HUGE hit to a viable CC method and 
                              ability to solo. Thanks to Veneficus one of our 
                              long time posters for giving us a heads up.</p>
                            <p class="spellltext"> Again, this is another example 
                              of why enchanters should have a united front. Please 
                              take a min. to check out the thread, and offer your 
                              opinions. </p>

                            <p class="spellltext">Again COD is looking at another 
                              change. The resist was changed to -0 from -50. As 
                              if the orginal changes were not enough to begin 
                              with. *sigh*</p>
                            <p class="spellltext">After talking with fellow enchanter 
                              Riart, I have come to realize that the site is getting 
                              big enough to start looking for a new &quot;no ad&quot; 
                              home that provides php. This includes the wonderful 
                              message boards! Oh and Riart is working on a new 
                              board system for all of us. /cheer Riart!! Proboards 
                              are terrific, but the ads are more than a little 
                              annoying. Last month someone was kind enough to 
                              donate $6.99 to have the boards be ad-free. It spoiled 
                              us terribly! BTW whomever that was .. thank you 
                              :) So ATM The Runes will be staying with sphosting 
                              (they have been great to) , but a heads up I'm looking 
                              for a new hosting company. <span class="smallpoint"><br>
                              </span></p>
                            <p class="spellltext">As some of you have noticed, 
                              I haven't been updating the new items. Unfortunately, 
                              this consumes hours of my time, and leaves me little 
                              to improve the quest, or zones area. I will keep 
                              the current pages up. However new items will now 
                              be listed under the zone they drop in. I will probably 
                              add a &quot;new items&quot; to the drop down for 
                              those who are interested, but they will now link 
                              to the item in the zone it drops in. If your REALLY 
                              REALLY unhappy about this change, go ahead and send 
                              me an e-mail, or you can post on the message boards 
                              and tell me off ;)</p>

                              </span>I'm in the process of updating the quest 
                              spells page to include our 2 new quest spells: Leviathon 
                              Eyes, and Scryers Trespass. Unfortunately the latest 
                              expansion didn't get enchanters any closer to the 
                              elusive lllusion:Scaled Wolf. *sigh* </p>
                            <p class="spellltext">I'm adding a new item page for 
                              charms. These are proving to be VERY interesting!

                              <span class="spellbold">** Gameplay ** </span></p>
                            <p class="spellltext">We've adjusted the entry requirements 
                              for some Planes of Power zones. Several of these 
                              zones required each character to complete a quest 
                              before gaining entry. We've relaxed this requirement 
                              somewhat as follows: </p>
                            <p class="spellltext">* A raid with 32 or more members 
                              can enter a locked plane provided that 85% of the 
                              raiders have finished the entry quest. This means 
                              a raid group can bring along some friends who haven't 
                              completed the quest. </p>
                            <p class="spellltext">* Characters who haven't done 
                              the entry quest must stay with their raid while 
                              they are in the locked zone. If these characters 
                              leave the raid for more than three minutes, they 
                              will be transported out to the Plane of Tranquility. 
                            </p>
                            <p class="spellltext">* Using this method does not 
                              grant permanent access to the locked zone. If a 
                              character wants permanent, unescorted access to 
                              a locked zone then they must still complete the 
                              quest. The goal of this change is to allow raiding 
                              groups to bring along a few friends who haven't 
                              been able to complete the quests, but still wish 
                              to help with the raid. </p>
                            <p class="spellltext">- Several of the flagging events 
                              will now only give out a maximum of 72 flags each 
                              time they are completed. <br>
                              - The dialogue boxes for resurrection and translocation 
                              will remain for 5 minutes instead of 1 hour. <br>
                              - Increased the maximum number of members on ignore 
                              and friends lists to 100. <br>
                              - Made some adjustments to the Halls of Honor alternate 
                              entry quest that should make it more friendly. <br>
                              - The horse buff icon will no longer show up for 
                              characters using non-Luclin models. </p>

                              after zoning. This prevents a bug that was causing 
                              the same container to be opened twice. <br>
                              - The rogue hide message &quot;You have moved and 
                              are no longer hidden!&quot; is filtered as a &quot;skill&quot; 
                              message and not an &quot;other&quot; message. <br>
                              - Fixed a bug that was causing the spell effects

                              Deathwatch Sword and Wetfang Steak have been corrected. 
                              <br>
                              - Corrected the name of the Drakescale Covered Tunic 
                              (was Drakscale Covered Tunic). <br>
                              - The Manicle of Disruption has been renamed Manacle 
                              of Disruption. <br>
                              - See above for Vorshar's Manicle of the Blight. 
                              <br>
                              - Corrected the spelling of Golden Idol of Rodcef 
                              Nife. <br>
                              - The Rantho Rapier is now a piercing weapon, not 
                              a two-hand slashing weapon. <br>
                              - The Wand of Mana Tapping is no longer labeled 
                              as usable in the secondary hand (since it is Enchanter 
                              only and could not be used there anyhow). </p>

                              both will have it as a reward on their Ethereal

                              - The &quot;Bag of Troll guts&quot; is now dropping

                              be up when the zone comes back up. If it has two

                              down it will still respawn in two days. <br>
                              - Prior to this patch Rallos Zek was changed, he

                              they should. <br>
                              - Denizens of Aerin`Dar's lair will no longer be 
                              getting angry at folks just because they are stomping 
                              around on the ground above the lair. <br>
                              - Puslings now understand how to &quot;enrage&quot; 
                              properly. <br>

                              to ignore people shooting them from a distance.

                              - Dalin Greskar has given up his hobby of trying 
                              to sell blacksmithing gear that he doesn't have 
                              and has gone legit with pottery supplies. <br>

                              - Corrected an error in Eirod Haerod's text. <br>
                              - It seems as though the troll sent to retrieve 
                              the Forge from fallen Grobb has returned with Forge 
                              in hand. <br>

                              <br>
                              - Disinfecting Aura has been changed to no longer 
                              cure poisonous effects. It will now cure disease 
                              effects with much more potency. <br>
                              - Fixed a bug that was causing Bind Sight to fail 
                              to land if the recipient had exactly 15 other buffs. 
                              <br>

                              - In a previous update, we added a message when 
                              a person recasts a charm spell on their charmed 
                              pet. Recasting charm on an existing pet did not 
                              actually re-charm the pet, it just failed silently 
                              and appeared to succeed. The new message is now 
                              displayed intentionally in these cases. This is 
                              not a bug. </p>

                              - Fixed a bug that was causing the reduced statistics 
                              to not update properly when the character has low 
                              hit points or is encumbered. <br>
                              - Fixed a bug that caused some sale prices for items

                              of the PoP zones last week. <br>
                              I also have some good news/bad news for you.. How 
                              about I give you the bad new first. <br>
                              <br>
                              As many of you know I'm just a player who loves 
                              her enchanter and was frustrated with the nonexistence 
                              of ANY enchanter site, so I built this one. Initially 
                              it really just to satisfy my desire to do some thing 
                              about it. Then suddenly the site just took off. 
                              Unfortunately the incredible amount of information 
                              such as items, zones, quests, trade skill etc has 
                              almost become unmanageable for me. After giving 
                              this a lot of thought I have come to the conclusion 
                              that for the time being SOMETHING has to give. I'm 
                              going to give you all a chance to let me know what 
                              it is you definitely want to keep here. </p>
                            <p class="spellltext">This is what I'm kinda thinking:</p>

                              -seems like it's a no-brainer, and really it's requires 
                              little work once the info is there.<br>
                              *<span class="spellbold">Quests</span>- I pretty 
                              much already provide a direct link to quests on 
                              Allakazams. IMO, that site is the best there is!<br>
                              *<span class="spellbold">Zones</span>- Personally 
                              this is one of my favorite areas of the site. Eventually 
                              I would like to have a complete guide to every zone 
                              that drops enchanter wearable items. From the items 
                              that drop, specific mob info with locations and 
                              spawn times, specific zone quests etc. <br>
                              *<span class="spellbold">Items</span>- I guess this 
                              is the one area that requires the majority of my 
                              time. Generally I spend so much time updating items 
                              that I don't have any left for the other areas of 
                              the site. And believe me this requires ALOT of time.</p>
                            <p class="spellltext"> Now I did say there was also 
                              good news :) The site is not going to die off. In 
                              fact the opposite, I want to make it better. If 
                              I can make the site more manageable, I can concentrate 
                              my energies on the areas left and make them great. 
                              As I said earlier, I will let all of you decide 
                              which areas you would like to see expanded. Your
