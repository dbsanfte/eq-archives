                            I send the webmaster of EQSpoilers, my favorite site 
                            if you can't tell, an e-mail. Seems they were hacked 
                            and their hosting company are not being helpful getting 
                            the site back up. Will be glad when they are back.

                            The patch turned into the usual fiasco, with the now 
                            customary emergency patches. In the case of enchanters, 
                            the changes to charm for the most part have gotten 
                            a negative response. Not for the experience penalty 
                            that charmed pets now have, but because of the MR 
                            changes. Enchanters are reporting that charm is breaking 
                            so often, it's almost useless. Absor showed up on 
                            the CastersRealm enchanter boards /faint, as did Illia 
                            to defend the changes. You can read the thread <a href="http://forums.crgaming.com/eqbb/viewtopic.php?t=85120" target="_blank" class="links">here</a><br>
                            <br>
                            There is also a change in Tash and some are saying 
                            our DD's after this patch. Tash is no longer causing 
                            the insane aggro. No idea how long this will last, 
                            enjoy while you can!<br>
                            <br>
                            The changes in Illusion faction are in fact causing 
                            disruption, and has caused as much anger as the Charm 
                            changes. Some are wondering how they will complete 
                            some quests, such as the Qeynos Catacomb for our epic. 
                            Unfortunately SOE didn't fix Night's Dark Terror while 
                            they were at it. So as of right now, no scarecrow 
                            for joo!</p>
                          <p class="spellltext">One of my favorite sites, EQSpoilers, 
                            has been down for the last few days. Hopefully this 
                            does not mean it's gone. I loved that site!! It had 
                            a lot of information that you couldn't find any place 
                            else. If anyone know what happened to it let me know. 
                            /cry</p>
                          <p class="spellltext">Oh last week I also forgot to 
                            mention I added the research info for the new researchable 
                            50-60 spells.</p>
                          <p class="spellltext">OH! I almost forgot, getting flags 
                            for the 2nd and 3rd tier became much easier! When 
                            one person completes a quest, all in the group recieve 
                            the flag. I don't think this applies when you recieve 
                            an actual key, but for quests such as the Diaku medallions 
                            in POS it will work. </p>

                            to charmed pets. From the patch message:</p>
                        </div>
                        <blockquote> 
                          <div align="center" class="spellbold">** Charm Changes 
                            **</div>
                          <div align="left"> 
                            <p><span class="smallpoint">- Healing a charmed pet 
                              now generates an appropriate amount of hate for 
                              the healer. <br>
                              - Charmed pets now take up to one third of the experience 
                              for each NPC killed. This amount scales down based 
                              on the percentage of damage to the target that the 
                              pet does. Dire charm pets still take the same experience 
                              they always have. <br>
                              - Charmed pets are no longer selected as a monster's 
                              preferred target if there are many players available 
                              for the monster to attack instead. </span><br>

                              <span class="smallpoint">We have changed the way 
                              that Illusions and Shape Changes work with respect 
                              to faction. The new system is a lot easier to understand 
                              than the old one, so we'll just explain the new 
                              one. When changed into the form of a playable race, 
                              characters are treated as if they were a member 
                              of that race. When changed into a non-playable race, 
                              characters retain their own racial factions. </span></p>
                            <p align="center"><span class="spellltext">Now in 
                              exactly what way this will affect us in the whole

                              part is probably a good change, there are definately 
                              times this may not be good.<br>
                              <br>
                              Examples: -Getting into the Brownie camp for mana 
                              vial spells could prove to be more interesting now.

                              - Minor Illusion has always given us neutral faction, 
                              assuming this was also changed.</span><br>
                              <span class="spellltext">-On the plus side, I would 
                              hope that SOE also fixed Nights Dark Terror reinstating 
                              the oh so cool Illusion: Scarecrow. According to 
                              Lucy it was not listed as having any changes yet. 
                              /sigh Geez, throw us a bone already. </span><br>

                              Other stuff for chanters in the patch message:<br>
                              - <span class="smallpoint">Dire Charm is no longer

                            </span>There are huge changes taking place on the

                            charm in PoP. Unfortunately these changes will impact 
                            all charmed pets even for the 63 levels before you 
                            can scribe COD. You can find the thread on the<a href="http://therunes.proboards6.com/index.cgi?board=general&action=display&num=1048271056" target="_blank" class="links"> 
                            boards</a>.</p>
                          <p class="spellltext"> Basically instead of changing 
                            COD, VI (on test) has changed the way mobs attribute 
                            damage caused by charmed pets. Enchanters have taken 
                            pretty significant hits lately, and this is could 
                            prove to be a HUGE hit to a viable CC method and ability 
                            to solo. Thanks to Veneficus one of our long time 
                            posters for giving us a heads up.</p>

                            of why enchanters should have a united front. Please
