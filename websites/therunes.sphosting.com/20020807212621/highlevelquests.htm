    to him.<br>
    -You say, 'where did they disappear?' <br>
    He will tell you he is unsure, but he last went on patrol of the Great Divide,

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Talk to Arbogast who can 
    be found in a building beside the bank in Katta Castellum. There is a lot 
    of story background and many dialogues between you, Arbogast and his friend 
    Miller. He will tell you that Phenic Dionicas is a vampire and if you wish 
    to see the truth he will hand you Arbogast's Water Vial which he wants you 
    to throw on Phenic's face.<br>
    <br>
    Phenic can be found on the second floor of the government building. Hand him 
    the water and he will smile at you and hand you back the Phenic's Water Vial. 
    Now return to Arbogast and hand him the water and he will say that the dark 
    magics are stronger than he though.<br>
    <br>
    He will then hand you back a Silver Wrapping Container and will tell you to 
    seek out Nathyn Illuminious (who he believes is actually Tsaph Katta). Retrieve 
    Nathyn's Memoirs from the room with the locked door in his castle [Pick Lock 
    Skill: 201]. Put it in the silver wrapping container and return it to Arbogast. 
    He will then spout some nonsence on how Norrath doesn't exist and that the 
    truth must be found. </font> </p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Follow this conversation 
    and he'll hand you a Gold Wrapping Container and will tell you to bring him 
    a book on the Exodus. <br>
    <br>
    Head off to the Shadowhaven Library and locate Rianna Birchard and ask her 
    &quot;do you know of the exodus&quot;. She will tell you that Peqi borrowed 
    it.<br>
    Peqi can be found in one of the buildings near the casters guild in Shadowhaven, 
    kill him to obtain it. Put the book in the gold wrapping container and hit 
    combine, now return it to Arbogast. He will tell you to bring him two Akuel 
    Xi Ans Vius [NO RENT] which drop in the Akheva Ruins and will then hand you 
    a Black Wrapping Paper. Once you have obtained them, place them inside the 
    paper and combine them, return once again to Arbogast.<br>
    <br>
    He and miller will head off to the bank to get some items for you... but instead 
    of handing them to you they will discuss it and then leave out the front door. 
    Now kill both Miller (Lvl 47 WAR) and Arbogast (Lvl 49 CLR) and you will obtain 
    a Heavy Wrap, 2 No Rent swords, a Clasp, a Shimmering Mace and some Baleen 
    Plate. Place the Clasp in the Heavy Wrap and hit combine, and you'll be left 
    with the Cloak of Truth.</font></p>
