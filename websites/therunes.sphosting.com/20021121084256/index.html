                              <p class="spellltext">A lone messenger streaks across 
                                the rocky roads of the mighty Wakening Lands, 
                                an urgent message kept safely within his talons. 
                                Dire news he brings to his master, the Lord Yelinak; 
                                there is much turmoil in wake of the prismatic's 
                                release, and he must inform the ancient dragon 
                                of the weary times to come. As he rushes past 
                                the lumbering trees on all sides of him, he harks 
                                back to a more peaceful time. Certainly the brow 
                                of his mighty Lord showed less strain, less agitation, 
                                though not much. He had always thought that the 
                                prismatic's release would surely be more problematic 
                                than anything else he could imagine. He now knew 
                                that there was much more at stake than ever before, 
                                and that the Shrine would need to be on its guard.</p>
                              <p class="spellltext">As he came to the entrance 
                                of the Shrine, he tensed for a moment, hoping 
                                that this dire news wouldn't end the life that 
                                he and his kin had known for so long. Yet he feared 
                                that nothing could stop that change, for the might 
                                of the Kin would be tested in the coming times, 
                                and there would surely be dangers he had yet to 
                                see. He made his way through the corridors up 
                                to his master's chambers. As he came closer, he 
                                noticed new members of the Kin he had never before 
                                seen. As large as his Lord, they spoke quietly 
                                amongst themselves and with Yelinak himself. He 
                                was unnerved by this startling addition to the 
                                Shrine, but felt that it was likely necessary. 
                                Perhaps his Lord had already heard the news and 
                                had already begun making plans. Either way, it 
                                was his duty to inform Yelinak of the recent events; 
                                the Giants would know no struggle like that which 
                                the Shrine would give them.</p>
                              <p class="spellltext">He walked towards Lord Yelinak, 
                                majestic in his appearance yet with a certain 
                                calming aura about him. He cleared his throat 
                                and began, &quot;M'lord Yelinak, I bring news 
                                from the East...&quot; </p></td>

                          message boards, I started redoing the gear pages. Tons 
                          of items have been added since I started this site. 
                          It was getting very difficult to wade through all of 
                          them. I have begun breaking down gear by approx level 
                          to obtain, player made, and unknown origins. I appreciate 
                          any feedback you may have. Especially items of unknown 
                          origin. We list many of the unknowns days, weeks before 
                          the &quot;major&quot; general EQ sites. So it would 
                          be great to have at least a zone to go with the items.

                          VI has introduced 2 new bonus things for us to play 
                          with. The EQIM, which is actually pretty neat. Hopefully 
                          they won't get us hooked then charge a ridiculous amount 
                          to keep it. Currently it's in beta, so it's a little 
                          buggy. I found that when I try to join a chat channel, 
                          if I put in the channelname:password it will give me 
                          an error. However, by just joining a channel and having 
                          it ask you for password it won't have problems.<br>
                          <br>
                          The EQMP3 player. I signed on to test lastnight, and 
                          this came up. *thumbs up* However, I keep my music on 
                          a seperate drive. And I couldnt get it to read folders 
                          on that drive. Hopefully they will fix that before release 
                          on live servers.<br>

                          for their response to this and will report back anything

                      The <a href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/eqim.jsp" target="_blank">EQIM</a>. 
                      Actually it's pretty neat. It allows you to IM people ingame, 
                      as well as be apart of channels without being logged on. 
                      Hmm, I wonder if this also includes petitions to GM's etc? 
                      Anyway, when released there is a free trial, followed by 
                      a &quot;nominal&quot; subscription fee. Well unless you 
                      are on a Legands server, then it will be free. <br>

                              <p class="smallpoint">Welcome to the Planes of Power. 
                                Of course, if you haven't purchased the expansion 
                                you can do so at our online store at www.everquest.com. 
                                If you have, prepare for adventure beyond Norrath 
                                and into the realm of the gods. We hope you have 
                                fun.</p>
                              <p class="smallpoint">One of the new features included 
                                in the Planes of Power is a new way for NPCs deal 
                                with Player Characters. It allows NPCs to recognize 
                                certain actions taken by player characters. This 
                                may mean that an NPC will not be interested in 
                                talking to you until you've accomplished a certain 
                                task or until certain events have occurred. So 
                                some NPCs may not have much to say to you upon 
                                your first meeting, but might be more talkative 
                                later. This can also apply to events and locations 
                                that might react differently to a character that 
                                has accomplished a task than to one that has not.</p>

                              <p class="smallpoint">The Raid functionality has 
                                been added. Here is a brief overview of the Raid 
                                system.</p>
                              <p class="smallpoint">In the past, experience on 
                                raids would generally go to a single group or 
                                a few groups. The group doing the most damage 
                                would get the experience on any given kill. But, 
                                that has been changed by a new Raid feature.</p>
                              <p class="smallpoint">The Raid system is intended 
                                to aid in the formation and organizing raids and 
                                make looting on raids a little more manageable. 
                                It allows a certain amount of experience to be 
                                shared among all members of a raid. The basics 
                                of the system work very much like grouping has 
                                always worked. The Raid Leader is the leader of 
                                all the raid groups and the group leaders remain 
                                leaders of their individual groups.</p>
                              <p class="smallpoint">Alt-R or /raidwindow will 
                                toggle the new Raid Window. This window works 
                                much like the group window. You can invite people 
                                to the raid (if you are the raid leader) and see 
                                a list of the folks in your raid, along with the 
                                status of those members (Raid Leader, Group Leader 
                                or raid member - which shows with no rank). It 
                                also shows you the group number of the individual 
                                members.</p>
                              <p class="smallpoint">Only Raid Leaders and Raid 
                                Group Leaders can invite people to a raid. This 
                                is done with the Invite button on the raid window.</p>
                              <p class="smallpoint">If a Raid Leader invites an 
                                individual (someone not in a group), that person 
                                joins the raid as a Raid Group Leader. If the 
                                Raid Leader invites a member of a group, the entire 
                                group joins the raid, and their group leader becomes 
                                a Raid Group Leader.</p>
                              <p class="smallpoint">A Raid Group Leader can invite 
                                people to their group, thus inviting them to join 
                                the raid group as well.</p>
                              <p class="smallpoint">Only a Raid Leader can remove 
                                someone from the raid. He or she does so simply 
                                by clicking on the character's name in the raid 
                                window and clicking the Disband button (also in 
                                the raid window).</p>
                              <p class="smallpoint">Being removed from your group 
                                (using the normal grouping features) will not 
                                remove you from the raid.</p>
                              <p class="smallpoint">You can remove yourself from 
                                the raid just by clicking the Disband button in 
                                the raid window.</p>
                              <p class="smallpoint">Just like groups, raids have 
                                their own chat channel. /rsay works for the raid 
                                just as /gsay does for groups. Just like group 
                                chat, you can set this to be your default channel 
                                for a given chat window by choosing it from the 
                                right-click Default Channel context menu.</p>
                              <p class="smallpoint">Experience for killing NPCs 
                                will be distributed to all members of the raid 
                                that are within range. However, the experience 
                                given will be smaller than the experience that 
                                would be earned by a single group. Generally, 
                                unless you are fighting NPCs that require a raid, 
                                you will still be better off earning experience 
                                with the old fashioned six- person group.</p>
                              <p class="smallpoint">Raids will definitely allow 
                                for larger than traditional groups, however, much 
                                of EverQuest is designed with the six- person 
                                group in mind. Adding a small number of people 
                                to a given group will allow this &quot;oversized&quot; 
                                group to gain experience. However, we recommend 
                                that once a &quot;raid&quot; of ten or more people 
                                forms, a second, traditional group split off and 
                                adventure on their own.</p>
                              <p class="smallpoint">The Raid Leader determines 
                                the looting permissions for any NPC killed by 
                                the raid. There are three types of looting that 
                                the leader can choose from (though the Raid Leader 
                                can always loot NPCs killed by the raid).</p>
                              <p class="smallpoint">1. Only the raid leader can

                                that can loot until the corpse opens up</p>

                                loot permissions only applies to NPCs that are
