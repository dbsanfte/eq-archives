    group of Arcane lightwalkers you will pride your house along with gathering

    Cloth of the Spurned. At that time you will put the pattern that I will give

    you want to craft. The items that you will need to collect will mostly be 
    found in the Forest but some will be here in town. As I said before seek out

    receive the Briefing Documents. The documents will tell you to search out 
    an Interrogator in South Karanas, and also tell you to obtain a Confession 
    Document from an Investigator. Run over to South Qeynos and talk to the investigator

    Hut and call out Theodore. There will be a small verbal battle and then the 
    Interrogator will tell you to hit Theo. Kill him and Theodore will immediatly 
    respawn and ask you what you want. Tell him &quot;take us to the location&quot;, 
    and he'll tell you to follow him. He leads you over to the druid rings and
