Play one of history's twelve mightiest civilizations! 
Command the Greek Phalanx, the worlds best infantry for hundreds of years. 
Lead the chariots of the Hittites, or Assyrians. 
Build up the vast agricultural empire of Egypt, Babylon, or Sumeria. 
Guide the Persians from their small enclave to prominence as a world power. 
Guide the Shang, Choson, or Yamoto for control of Asia. 
Dominate the world sea trade as the Phoenicians or Minoans. <P>
The civilization you choose to play depends on the victory conditions of the game and the strengths and weaknesses of your opponents. 
For example, if a world has extensive seas, choose to play a civilization with advantages in ship building or speed(Yamoto, Phonecian, Minoan). 
If you are competing with the Persians, prepare for eventual clashes with War Elephants. 
Each civilization has strengths and weaknesses and can research different technologies. 
Here are each civilizations special attributes and some comments: <br>

*The extra speed of your villagers with this civ. gives you a huge advantage over your opponents. 
You can get yourself set up and ready to fight 30% more quickly than your opponent!!!*<BR>
<FONT SIZE=3 COLOR="RED" FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN">The big bonus this tribe has is the +40% archery range fire rate and the +30% is also pretty nice. In the Bronze Age a chariot rush is devastating, send in a group of 15-20 chariot archers and there’s nothing that the enemy can do to stop you. You must archer rush with this tribe. So what if you don’t have a phalanx or a centurion! Make hoplites to create a front line to slow down the enemy from getting to your archers.<BR><P></FONT>

<FONT SIZE=3 COLOR="RED" FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN">Basically a camping, build-a-wonder-tribe. With the double wall and tower points plus the +30% stone mining you can fortify your town extremely well. Babylonians only have hoplites and the cavalry and chariot for stable units. They suck on the seas because they lack a trireme. If your playing with this tribe just stay at your empire or rarely attack the enemy, work on building up you defences and world wonder.<BR><P></FONT>

<FONT SIZE=3 COLOR="RED" FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN">I've been playing AoE for a while now and i realized that every civilization can
be good when you play it right. Problem is the only thing you said about
Choson is that they suck? You must be on crack. When you look at it
Chosons only have 1 weakness its farthest reaching unit is still 2
squares short of the farther hitting catapults. THIS IS THE ONLY DOWNFALL OF
CHOSON. They got a great ground attack with huge support for the already
amazing infantry they can get. Think about it a ammazingly cheap unit
that works so damn good since they have the 80+ hitpoints for legions
and longswordsmen. Also their priest are only rivaled by Egypt. They
have the best weapon for infantry support the balista. The catapult is
stronger but tell me which would you say is better on sea a trimmie by
itself against a jugg? The trimmie cause it will always hit and it will
only damage the enemy. The helopolista can waste a elephant before it
got to the front lines of the Legions which will handle it easily
anyways. Thats if the elephant gets past conversion. I dont play Choson
unless all my opponents are short range civilizations. Any civilization besides Sumerian
and Hittite can be taken easily by choson army. These 2 civilizations because
they have the catapult advantages. The only civilization that can really rival the
Choson besides Hittite and Sumerians are the Egyptians. </FONT>

<UL>
<LI>+20% Gold mining. *No good in DM*<BR>
<LI>+33% Chariot and Chariot Archer hit points.<BR>
<LI>+3 Preist range<BR>
</UL><CENTER>
<FONT SIZE=3 COLOR="RED" FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN">Their infantry suck and they only have the stone thrower. The +20% gold mining and the +33% chariot bonuses make up for the infantry. The key with the Egyptians is to make A LOT of elephants since they’re the Egyptians most powerful ground unit. The +20% gold mining will really help you pump out elephants and priests. Another powerful aspect is that the chariots get +33% hit points, this tribe kicks butt in the Bronze Age. Just rush the enemy town with your chariot archers and chariots. In the Iron Age you have two pretty huge advantages on defence and attacking. 1. You have elephants which are pretty easy to pump out with +20% gold mining for attacking. 2. The +3 conversion range is really helpful in  defending your empire. When  an  enemy attacks send out your elephants first, have the enemy fight the elephants for a while. While they are attacking the elephants , send out your priests, KEEP THEM IN TOWER RANGE or they’re toast. Convert every enemy you  can, the enemy will charge your priests but will be converted to your side by the time they get to your priests because of the +3 conversion range. With 6-8 priests, for the time it takes the first 1st priest to restore the enemies’ faith, you will have gone the other priests and are ready to convert another enemy with your 1st priest. <BR><P></FONT>

<FONT SIZE=3 COLOR="RED" FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN">Bad on land, awesome on the high seas. On land they only have a bowman! Your academy unit will get wasted even though they have +30% speed. Greek stables are okay with a cavalry and heavy cavalry. Their strength is in their navy. They can make every ship and a  +30% speed bonus to warships. Take two catapult triremes, group them, attack the enemy, dodge incoming fire, and then fire back.<BR><P></FONT>

<FONT SIZE=3 COLOR="RED" FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN">Hittites are great on the sea, EXCEPT in the Iron Age, then they get wasted by triremes. The key to winning with this tribe is to take out the enemies’ dock before the Iron Age. Then build tons of war galley’s and surround the enemies’ coast line to make sure that they don’t build another dock. On land the Hittites kick butt! The double hit points the catapults get rules, just send in a bunch of catapults into an enemy empire and spread the catapults apart so that if one catapult is getting attacked another one can kill the unit that’s attacking the catapult(you can even leave the catapults unguarded).<BR><P></FONT>

<FONT SIZE=3 COLOR="RED" FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN">The elephant tribe. This tribe kicks with its supercharged elephants.  They move +50% faster. Don’t worry about making stable units to take out a catapult, just send in an elephant. The +50% trireme fire rate is really good. The Persians have -30% farming and no ballista tower.<BR><P></FONT>

<FONT SIZE=3 COLOR="RED" FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN">The Phoenician are pretty well rounded. The -25% elephant cost is pretty good, this tribe makes a very good newbie tribe. Lacking the horse archer more experienced players will not want to use this tribe. This tribe is a pretty good on the sea with the +65% fire rate for the triremes.<BR><P></FONT>

<LI>Double Farm production.<BR></UL><CENTER>
<FONT SIZE=3 COLOR="red" FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN">The Sumerian are a very strong tribe. They suck on the sea so don’t even think about usin’ them on water maps. But on land the Sumerian rule with the +50% catapult fire rate. Also the double farm production is really good. When you charge a city with a group of academy units, war elephants, and catapults almost nothing will stop you. Take out those towers and pesky archers twice as fast with your catapults. Also Sumerians can be used to get an easy and quick win. Since Sumerian villagers are as as strong as clubmen its a good idea to rush the enemy early with villagers. The way to do this most effectively is by first finding out were berry bushes are then build a granary right next to them. Have two villagers gather, build a house, and make a villager . After you did that put the three villagers on the bushes and make another villager. With your 5th and 6th villagers, put them on wood for houses then every villager after builds a house and gather food of hunts. <BR><P></FONT>

<UL><LI>-25% Horse Archers, Scout, Cavalry, Heavy Cavalry, Cataphract cost.<BR>
<LI>Villagers 30% faster.<BR>
<LI>+30% ship hit points.<BR></UL><CENTER>
<FONT SIZE=3 COLOR="red" FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN">This tribe would rock if they didn’t lack one thing, the ballista tower! It still is a great tribe without the ballista tower because of the -25% cost for all horse units, and because of the +30% ship hit points. The key to winning with this tribe is to keep your enemy on defence. <BR><P></FONT>
