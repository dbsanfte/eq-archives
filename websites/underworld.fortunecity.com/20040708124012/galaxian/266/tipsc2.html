Tips & Tactics - Easter Eggs & Bugs<br><br>
</center></h2>
<h3>
Tips & Tactics<br><br>
</h3>
Press the 'Return' key whilst driving along to fling open your doors.. useful if you are just going to miss a pedestrian! Press it again, to lock them back so they don't swing open accidentally when going round corners...<br><br>

If you have a Kangaroo On Command power up, then always keep it ready so that if a big opponent is going to ram you, you can press 'Alt' and spring up out the way, meaning he goes flying past. It works even better if there is a wall next to you, because he's going so fast he can't brake to avoid it and wastes himself.<br><br>

Always have your fingers deployed right over the repair key... as soon as any damage is inflicted, no matter how small, repair yourself because you never know where that damn volvo is...<br><br>

Get suicidal peds. Stop in a crowded area. The peds will all run up to you and trip on your car, but not die. Wait until the timer is almost expired, then use a kangaroo jump. Splut, in a big way. For an interesting variation, use a ped repulser, intead of a jump...<br><br>

Before going into a corner hit 'Z' several times to downshift a few gears to swing the back end out a little so you can take the corner faster.<br><br>

If you delete the file DEMO.TXT in the carmageddon 2 demodata directory it will get rid of the demo time-out so you can play for as long as you like. You can also edit the powerup.txt file to change how long a powerup stays active. There's nothing like a 4 minute long electo-bastard ray to get some points.<br><br>

If you're really into being a coward, attract the volvos attention, then hide behind a lamp post. He will still see you, come charging towards you, but hit the post rather than you. You won't be rewarded for any damage caused to him. But that serves you right for being a coward.<br><br>

Hold down Z when you are under water... It makes the driving easier!<br><br>

With the Kangaroo Power Up, Jump onto an opponent. If it's something like Larry Lamba, or Vlad, when you land on them they'll explode instantly.<br><br>

Get all the brown power-ups because they tend to give you extra space for Engine Power, Offensive, and Armor.<br><br>

Before the race begins, you can jump ahead of everyone and get a head start... press the "z" key whilst at the grid and the announcer will say "hey you" and give you a 1000 credit fine, but you get to start ahead of everyone.<br><br>

Get the "dismemberfest" power up, then gently tap the pedestrians so their limbs fly off but they do not die. Nothing is funnier than watching a one-legged ped hop around, with blood pouring out of his bloody stump! It is possible to knock all four limbs off without killing the ped. Game of football, anyone?<br><br>

Instead of running the peds over, use your horn (H key) to scare them off any nearby ledges, so they kill themselves.. there's an additional bonus for this! - If they land in water then they will happily doggy paddle around.. it doesn't give you a bonus (because they don't die) but it's funny to watch.<br><br>

If you have an instant handbrake and you accidentally drive over a cliff and are falling rapidly to your death, wait till you are just above the ground and slam on the handbrake, you will stop in mid air! Meaning you  can then safely fall the little bit to go.<br><br>

If you edit the Opponent.txt file, you can change who you race against. I usually make all my opponents .txt comments BUZZ.TXT, so all the opponents are buzz and its easy as hell to waste em. Also in General.txt you can change which acr you drive. Go find the Eagle3.txt comment and change it to any of the names in the cars folder, you will then be able to drive that particluar car. <br><br>

Get in to the fenced off area's with the kangaroo on command power-up.<br><br>

To break really quickly hold backwards, as well as the handbrake. It can save you running in to wall's etc... and is especially good if you are on a big building, and don't want to fall off.<br><br>

If you get a kangeroo powerup, try to get on the top of the buildings that are on the very edges of the map. Up there are enough powerups to keep you very happy.<br><br>

If you are heading towards a wall and dont want to take a lot of damage hit the hand brake and tap a turn key and you will turn side ways and will not take as much damage as hitting a wall or object head on.<br><br>

If you are going really fast and you are about to hit something that will no doubt waste you, hit the INSERT key before you hit it and you will be taken somewhere safe.<br><br>

when you get kangaroo on command, you can use it in midair. use your imagination!<br><br>

You can get on the biggest buildings by going through the pipes that are aimed practically vertical but you must use the afterburner or you'll land short!!!<br><br>

During the game, press Shift-D, and it will take a snapshot of the way your car is in the game. Then after the game go to the directry and you can find those pictures named dump001 and so on.<br><br>

If you tap the handbrake right at the end of a ramp, instead of slowly flipping forwards, the car leans back. This makes it much easier to land long jumps without flipping the car.<br><br>

Here's a fun thing to do... get a (live) ped on your car. Juggle the ped until it's exactly on top of you car. Use a ped repulser. Watch him go! <br><br>

Get a live Ped on top of your car, then use your Kangaroo powerup.......lots.<br><br>

When you beep your horn, the peds often stop and look around horrifed. So if you are having trouble getting a ped, honk your horn until he stops then run him over!<br><br>

Go into the powerup.txt file in the data folder. From then on its pretty straight forward to edit the powerups. e.g. 999 kangaroos from one cannister<br><br>

Here's something fun to do... Get the Carmageddon2 option editor and see how fast you can make the car go. I once got the volvo above 400 on a straightaway. Remember to use the recover key before you slam into a wall or a pole though!<br><br>

If you get the Solid Granite Car powerup start knocking over some lamps and trees and then block the road, watch your opponents as they slam inte your barrier at full speed..muhaha<br><br>

Look for the sign that says "MAX'S AUTO-RECKING YARD" (Near the part of the track where it dips down) If you drive round the back you will see a small passage. Drive in and your car will bend like hell and you get WASTED!<br><br>

Kill a slow tough opponent by using the afterburner to push him into a wall - but don't forget to turn at the last moment or you'll screw your front up!!<br><br>

For serious fun, change your car to the Volvo, and change all the opponents to volvos. Then have a truck race. <br><br>

When that damned Volvo or anyother car is coming full speed ahead to bang you on the rear end, press the Z key and either the left or the right key. Your car will skid to the left or right and the opponent will buzz past you unless you are not fast enough!<br><br>

You can pull a piledriver move on peds/enemies. Use a kangaroo jump, then change in mid air to a repulsificator, if you are above your target and fire they will get driven into the ground and get a shitload of damage.<br><br>

Open the powerup.txt file and edit it so that you start the race with hundreds of opponent repulsifiers. Also make it so that frozen opponents is on at the beginning of the race. Fire off the repulsifiers as fast as possible and watch the carnage unfold..<br><br>

You can throw peds through the glass windows, just get the pedistrian repulsifier, find someone near a glass window and spring them through it! Unfortunately there aren't any extra points etc.. but it is very funny!<br><br>

When Suicidal Pedestrians is on, they will run over and clump around pieces of your car that have fallen off! Locate a piece that you've lost and mow down the crown standing around it.<br><br>

When the peds are Etherworld peds power up is active, even though you can drive through them, you can still kill them with the Pedestrian Electric Zapper thing.<br><br>

Among the lesser known pedestrian bonuses: Cat + Mouse bonus: Knock off a limb for bonus points &  Dropped like a stone: Knock a pedestrian more than two stories lower than you.<br><br>

At the start if you have a wimpy car behind you, then get the rev's up in reverse by holding backwards, and the moment it say's go, reverse straight in to them. If it's the diablo or the porsche you can often waste them.<br><br>

Sometimes when you are split in two you can repair yourself, but it costs a fortune!<br><br>

All around the underwater sections of the demo there are tunnels that lead to a chamber of cool powerups, however on the way out down one of the tunnels you can get split in half!<br><br>

Try hitting an obese pedestrian while going uphill in reverse. If you start slow and get them caught on the bumper, you can speed up and keep them stuck there. Watch them fly into the air doing fantastic flips and gyrations when you collide with another car.<br><br>

For fun try setting the damping factor in the 'wheels' sections of Eagle3.txt to a value greater than 1. You'll bounce about all over the place!<br><br>

You can edit the physics of your car near the bottom of the Eagle3.txt file. The car handles better if you move the center of gravity down (second of three entries) and forward (negitive value for the third entry). Also you can increase the engine power, but you should also increase the traction multiplier on both the rear wheels at the same time.<br><br>

The UK Carma2 disk is not fully compatible with all cd-rom drives such as pioneer dra-24x, due to the anti piracy program the game is shipped with, this is a real bastard as I wanna play this damn game and can't do anything to get it to work, save buying a new cd drive!<br><br>

When up against a big opponent, drive infront of them, then reverse into them and lay a mine if you have any! <br><br>

When you are up against Pitbull (Big Yellow Truck) turn sideways so your left or right door is touching the front of his car. You should now be 'protected' by the big claws when he pushes you up against walls. This normally ends up with him killing himself instead of you when he rams stuff!<br><br>

If you take screen shots in the replay mode, you don't get all the huge speedo's etc.. appearing in the picture as well.<br><br>

With a barrel of enemy repusificator's you only get three shots! My advice is to get ito a crowd of people before leting it off! With one shot you can fling up to six enemies!<br><br>

In the full version, there is a mission in which you have to waste escaped patients. There is one pedestrian on a mountain that is hard to reach. Stop in front of the mountain, activate the map, and start horning. The pedestrian will get scared, and walk of the mountain. weeeee *splat* That's it! In another mission, you will have to destroy a BIG truck... which is difficult. Get the solid granite car power-up (in front of you, to the left) and then head for the truck. Hit'em head-on and BOOM! mission completed!<br><br>

Having trouble moving boulders : Simply find a Solid Granit Car powerup, the boulders just bounce away.<br><br>

Try getting a giant mutant tail thingy, and a pinball powerup, it's cool when your tail starts bouncing, and starts pulling your car up and down!<br><br>

Want to rid the Canadian mountain levels of those trains that make up one very big obstacle? Just get a solid granite car powerup and smack 'em head on and watch as the carriages pile up and smash to pieces!<br><br>

If you land with your car on its side, press the 'z' key a couple of times to put you back on your wheels instead of pressing the "insert" key. <br><br>

You can send mines flying into peds by doing a handbrake turn and using the mine powerup at the same time. <br><br>

If you need the biggest run up possible for a jump and find that when reversing backwards you smash into trees or fall off the end of buildings, then here's a brilliant tip! While reversing press 'C' once to put the camera 'in-car' then a second time to bring it out again, the camera will now be looking back at the car, so now you can get the car to the extreme edge of, say, buildings without falling off. Accelerate away and the camera will automatically swing back to face forward again.<br><br>

If you get stuck on s small hill and your wheels keep spinning instead of pressing insert try opening your doors<br><br>

Some cars can even be rocked back onto their wheels with the 'z' key when they are on their roof! One example is the fork lift truck - saves a lot on recover costs.<br><br>

You can make peds trip over by running into them at slow speed. They will not be dead yet though. So you can push them along and aim them at other peds by stopping suddenly, and letting the momentum throw his body into theother peds.<br><br>

The sounds in the demo can be replaced with any 22khz sound file, REGARDLESS of its length! :)<br><br>

On the demo, its possible to find places in the ground where your car will sink. Its almost like Jaws when you surface near a ped!<br><br>

When you get bouncy bouncy, make the most of it by trying to land on top of pedestrians earning an Artistic Impression bonus<br><br>

If you have a problem getting the game to run because of CDROM problems - try going to Device Manager, and looking at the settings for your CDROM drive - Turn off "DMA" option if it is ticked, reboot and try to play the game - It worked for me. Before i did this I just got a big freeze before the Intro Video comes on.<br><br>

To get more time go in to your carmageddon2 data folder then peds, now double click on settings.txt, then find the line "// Time score per ped" and change the number to about 5000. Then when you hit someone you will have about 85 minutes.<br><br>

Hold down space bar and then accelerate and release space bar... this will give you a fast start. good for jumps without much space to take a run up.<br><br>

In beaver quarry, go to the inlet with a lot of explosive barrels, then get the pinball mode powerup and when you drive out of the inlet you hit a mine you will go flying and everytime you land you hit another mine or bounce of the walls untill you go flying for 2 minutes!<br><br>

I haven't been able to do it enough reliably, but it seems like you can save a few credits when you get split in two by hitting recover first instead of repairing right away. <br><br>

To cheat the game, edit the data.txt file. you can change anything in the game right there. Remember to make backups of anything you play with.<br><br>

If you're lying upside down.. use the kangaroo powerup, and on the way down swing open your doors. The car's doors will hit the ground first, and tip the rest of the car back on it's wheels. A true money saver. NOTE: It only works with cars that has doors that swing sideways, and not up like the lamborghini.<br><br>

If you want a doorless car, try opening your doors by hitting 'return' and then drive backwards until you hit a lampost or building. <br><br>

By knocking down a lamp post and driving behind it you can use it as a plough in a crowd of peds.<br><br>

You can snap 1/3 of your car off without being wasted by going fast into the SIDE of the solid 'turn' signs. Just remember to try and hit only 1/3 of the car, otherwise you will split the car in half and be wasted.<br><br>

A fun thing to do is to try to -just- hit the top of another car when you are jumping. The other car will flip around heaps. There's not really much point to it, but it looks damn cool and can often send them flying into stuff : )<br><br>

Use the Electric bastard Ray thingy and kill lots of peds. Then get the Peds/Zombies with stupid heads powerup. It makes all the dead peds have big heads so you can push them round (anyone for a game of football?)<br><br>

If you get cut in half while driving the Plow M.K.2. You can still drive one half of the car by using the afterburner! <br><br>

When your sideways by a wall and a car is coming at you. Slam it in reverse or forward, and get out of the way and let them crash into the wall. (works best with Diablo and other small cars)<br><br>

try slowly hitting a ped and then push him full speed into a wall. The ped sometimes splats upside down and sticks there!<br><br>

To get rid of the volvo or any other big car, push it into a lake or the sea, and then press insert to carry on killing without being hassled.<br><br>

If you ram an opponent you do more damage than if you get behind an opponent and push them into a wall. Both are still very effective at wasting though.. <br><br>

For most of the missions choose a car that you know like the back of your hand! (i.e. the Eagle Mk.3) You will nearly always fail if you are also trying to learn how to drive a new car whilst attempting a mission.<br><br>

For the final Carpocalypse Now mission, you must destroy all the targets on the map. Even though it opens some of the passage ways before all the barrels etc.. are destroyed, you must still get them all! If you don't.. when you hit the end button, you will have to go back and get the targets you've left standing, which uses more time!<br><br>

When you have a 'Mutant Tail Thingy' drive around in Do-Nuts using the handbrake and 'z'- Very cool in a crouded area!!!<br><br>

If you go into the Data folder in the Carmageddon 2 Demo directory, and open the 'Opponent.TXT' you can change the names of your opponents, and personalise the game, Worms-style. The first name is the one displayed in the Current Opponent box, the one below it is the name displayed when you waste that car. :-)<br><br>

When jumping off a roof, cliff or other high spot, hit the hand brake and slide sideways off the edge. This puts you in a flat spin guaranteed to land you on your wheels.<br><br>

When you're in the snowy-ski-mountain level with those ice statues, look for the entrance of the bobsled ride way up the moutain. Then slowly drive through the wooden gatehouse, press 'c' to change your view, press the up-arrow to move the camera upfront and relax..... HAVE THE RIDE OF YOUR LIFE .... <br><br>

After getting the ethereal peds find yourself a Suicidal Peds powerup. Watch all the peds come flocking to you and gather at the center of your car. Just sit there and watch the show when the Ethereal Ped powerup wears off!!!<br><br>

On the airport levels, the jumbo jet can be moved around if you have a tough enough car, best go for overkill and use pitbull's truck. You can place the jets as obstructions where you want. What is fun though, if you ram the jet hard enough when it is taking off it will veer off the runway crashing into the water with its tail in the air. Pointless but amusing!<br><br>

If you have a pedestrian on the roof of your car, you can play hacky-sack with them using the Kangaroo power-up. This takes some practise, but makes a great replay movie.<br><br>

When you're dragging an opponent into a wall, use the Opponent Repulsificator just before crush them into the wall. Very damaging to your opponent.<br><br>

If you want to edit the game you will need the twt unpacker , then go to the main carmageddon dir and unpack the file DATA.TWT , in there is all the good stuff like powerup.txt etc , then just load them into a text editor and change whatever you want, fun for all the family HAHA !<br><br>

Drive carefully at all times.. you are not ever invincible, unless you edit the files!<br><br>

In Beaver Woods, go to the farm between the water and the woodlogs. On the left handside of the barn-entrance, you can find 4 containers of Pedestrian Flamethrower which keep coming back : burn baby burn !<br><br>

Lock on the nearest car with the 'T' key. Whenever the "Target" crashes into an object, you'll get the points. Even when he wastes wimself!<br><br>

No underwater ability? Just drive in reverse for more control over your car.<br><br>

If you want to have the smallest replays files, just record the scenes with a FIXED camera, just be sure that the camera doesn't move at all (use the manual camera, and click somewhere on the landscape, not on a moving object like cars or peds). That way you can get really small zipped files.<br><br>

When you have few Opponent Repulsificators left, use them wisely. If your opponent is dazed or slow, try to herd them toward one of the striped barriers, or an other sharp object. Push them into it, then angle them toward a builing or suitable damage-inflicter. Then get the repulsificator and fire away!!<br><br>

If you edit the POWERUP.TXT files in the demo, give the 'Explosive Zombies' and the 'Suicidal Zombies' a 0 time, to make them active the entire race once obtained. When you are bored in a game or need a break, park your car in a heavily popuated part of the map, and all the zombies in the area will flock to your car and kill themselves! Come back to a pile of bloodied limbs surrounding your car!<br><br>

Here's an easy way to get the "Nice Shot Sir" Bonus: Drive into a box or an object and hit a pedestrian. If they always die, then this trick isn't for you. If they only loose limbs or blood like most people have experienced, just drive back to the ped and run them down... You'll still get the "Nice Shot Sir" bonus. Simple as that.<br><br>

Knock off your front fenders it make running over peds a lot easier.<br><br>

If you are in an area where there are lots of mines, just push some debris \ a corpse ahead of you. This should prevent your car from being damaged by the mines.<br><br>

when you are in the mission where you have to kill 12 cop cars use the bus and go on the long freeway and get a  running start and all the cop cars will come at you head on you sould be abe to wate them all with time to spare.<br><br>

If you are racing around really fast and are about to hit a wall and waste yourself use your afterburner and hit reverse to stop faster than normal! <br><br>

Having Trouble completing the missions in time? unpack DATA.TWT, edit Races.txt find the mission, and double the time-limit. (Is displayed as XXX,XXX,XXX (X=number) save, repack as Data.TWT copy it, and replay the mission. You now have double the time to complete it!. Or get some of the patches that do similar things from the files section of this site.<br><br>

In the FAIR GRIND mission (Kill Clowns) there are three extra slots to be found on the Right side upon the ledge. Turn around, follow the road, drive up the ledge ann follow it along the wall. You get given 3 extra slots which you KEEP even if your mission failed. So do the mission over and over until you have 20 slots. <br><br>

You keep any extra slots picked up during a failed mission. Only problem is that if you don't complete a track or misssion afterwards, they are lost. You see, you do get the slots, but the game only saves when you complete a track...meaning no loading or exiting the game! ;)<br><br>

If you have have trouble with Mission 7, the one where you have to kill some peds in the control tower, this is what you have to do: Find a Kangaroo on Command powerup (there is one in the airport gift shop), now you can jump your way into the tower. If that doesn't work, find an electro ray powerup, and use the ramp to fly over the tower, when your above the tower, use it! Go fry some ped ass!!!!<br><br>

For a SERIOUS upgrade, max's junkyard is the place to be... There are a ot of upgrade bonuses all over the place.. Try just outside a glass building on the right side of the map, as well as several nearby roof areas.. When you've got the slots, head to the secret underground powerup-area.. There are several entrances, but the easiest to find is the water area in the bottom left corner. DO NOT pick up the four upgrade bonuses lying there, just get one of the underwater ability powerups. Drive into the tunnel, and in the center room is a pool with three upgrades. They are NOT ordinary upgrades, but FULL upgrades. Grab 'em, and head back out again the way you came. Now pick up the four upgrades in the aforementioned water area, for some easy credits.. Quite a few, actually... ;)<br><br>

For lots of cash, try getting a ped annihilator, ped repulsificator or an electro bastard ray. Drive rather fast into a crowded area and get airborne. How? Be creative! Anyway, get airborne, preferably while twisting or spinning in the air. Fry/splat the peds as you fly over them, and you'll probably get artistic impression bonus as well as the combo bonus.. <br><br>

If you're looking for a new way to kill opponents, go to the airport level and get a solid granite car. Now start pushing one of the planes around. Hopefully it should start to rock. If you get it to rock so that the tail smashes an opponent on the roof, you can usually kill them straight off.<br><br>

For returning your view to the default, press the left and right cursor keys simultaneously<br><br>

Usually when near the edge of a building or cliff, if you honk your horn, the peds will jump to their deaths. (helps a lot in missions with this situation)<br><br>

If you want a lot of fun, get Pinball Mode, then drop a big boulder off a very high place - watch that baby bounce!!!<br><br>

On the 'Con rod air' race it is possible to cause the jumbo jet to crash while airborne. Use Batmad's car as it appears to be the fastest accelerating one. On the right hand runway the jets land, taxi, and take off. Basically find one about to take off and follow it, accelerating like a bastard to keep up and either; clip the the last wheel to leave the ground, or, use the ramp by the water to 'fly' into the wing. Even for Carma 2 the result is pretty amusing and gruesome!<br><br>

With Forking Ada, Cunning Stunt bonuses are easy to come by. I mean, he can wheelspin himself out of anything, and when he lands on his wheels he gets a Bonus. Hell, if he even does a little jump and lands on his wheels he gets a Bonus sometimes. 1000s of easy credits.<br><br>

you can change the amount of credits you recieve for killing a ped. go into the carmageddon2 program files, go into data and into peds and on the line that says credits scored for a ped change it to any amount you please... that way you can buy any thing you want!<br><br>

Always try and find a long straight with hardly any bumps so you can plough into an opponent at max speed without losing control.<br><br>

If you feel in need of a change, set the gore level down to the lowest setting. When you go to run a ped over, there will be no blood, but their bodies will still fall over. It's cool in a twisted sort of way!<br><br>

Go to the Powerups.txt in your Data folder in your Carmegeddon 2 folder. Find the Pedestrian Electro-bastard Ray powerup comments, and change the time limit to zero. This allows you to have one hell of a time. Hint: you can change any powerup in the Powerup.txt and it's fun!<br><br>

Once you have all the cars get the cop, because all 4 doors will open!!, and they open, Left 2, then the Right 2 doors, so cycling of the doors is possible! Because there are 4 doors you have to press the repair button to close them all.<br><br>

Get a pedestrian on the front of your car and slowly push them into a bomb and watch as their limbs blow off or they fly into the air. If you blow only a couple of limbs off, you get the cat n mouse bonus!<br><br>

If you increase your offensive enough, your opponents start `shitting themselves`. I laughed out loud when I first saw this!<br><br>

While whizzing through the air, you can actually choose to turn and face a new direction while flying...this helps to make sure you won't waste yourself by going head-first into a wall.<br><br>

There are some roads that the yellow dump truck will not fit down and you can seek refuge in such places.<br><br>

Another way to waste the 12 cops in the bruise brothers: Get the big yellow dump truck, and head for the overhead bridge, go as far as you can, turn around and drive very slowly along the freeway, the cops will charge at you at full speed and the will get wasted as they try to smash into you. They will all get wasted and you will not get pushed around by the impacts and debris. After you reach the end of the bridge, you will still have plenty of time to mop up and waste any remaining cops.<br><br>

To kill big cars, sit in front of a poll, lampost, etc.. and wait for the opponent to come after you. When he is just about to hit you, press insert and disappear letting him smash in to the obstacle.<br><br>

Re-do easy levels to get extra credits!<br><br>

Try opening your doors and backing up into a ped slowly. So that they don't get killed but get caught. Then keep driving backwards and close your doors to squish em!<br><br>

If you want to get rid of the mutant tail thing, you might as well try and get as many points as possible whilst cutting it off. Basically find a crowd of peds, accelerate towards them then swing the car around and cut off the tail so that it's momentum carries it straight through the crowd of peds gaining you lots of cool bonuses.<br><br>

If you find a deer or moose, just drive up to it and push it along slowly then slam on the gas. Most times you will snap of one of it's legs and you will get a cat & mouse bonus.<br><br>

In the Beaver Woods track go to the street outside the hospital. Painted on the road is a "?" with an arrow. Follow it at high speed and jump into the cliff face. Fly through the false wall hiding the secret "Twin Peaks Grotto".<br><br>

When driving on the ski levels slopes, use the pink buggy for the best control. Remember not to take the 90m ski jump at full speed though...<br><br>

to get 200,000 credits really easily, on max's junkyard go to area in the side of the road with fenced of goodies and a kangaroo on command powerup, drive along the road a bit more and theres another small section in the side of the road which you jump the fence and land sideways, get all the powerups and use insert to get out (because you can't jump out, it's to small) and you can use the other 2 on the place where you got it from.<br><br>

Get a pedestrain on the front of your car and slowly push them into a small tree. Then watch the tree fall on them. Squish! 
Get a movable object such as a pedestrian car, wasted opponent, small tree, etc. and get them on the front of your car. Then go fast and hit brake to watch it fly off. You can aim for pedestrains to smack 'em over and get points. <br><br>

To get a 50,000 pts.. in Beaver City; Near the starting point, find the carwash. Inside are points (alot.), and powerups too..<br><br>

When on one of the mountain levels, enter the hospital and get the pinball mode. Watch as the peds bounce around quite a lot... and you can bounce the beds and stuff outside getting a ton of points ( if you do it right of course !! )<br><br>

Here's a great way to waste an opponent using the opponent repulsificator...Hang around a glass building and wait for an opponent to drive in front of it, then use the repulsificator. Most cars won't be able to fit through the space between the glass when you spring them so you'll likely kill them in one hit.<br><br>

Using the ped. repulsifier, if you use it on elephants they do somersults (or just roll over) in stupid ways. If someone edited the airport, with elephants in the glass buildings... He-He-He<br><br>

Want to get rid of some mines without getting hurt at ALL? Just smash the mines by opening your door at them... just like you do with the peds...<br><br>

Have you got the big yellow dump truck and can't fit through a checkpoint or a place that is too low, well reverse through it and you can usually fit straight under, but watch out for any obstructions on the other side, as you will get wasted if you get stuck in a low place for too long.<br><br>

Try and do all of the tricks in the fairground properly. Loop the loop, flamming hoop jump and the Big Hill are the main 3. It's also fun to ride the log flume!<br><br>

Don't get hit on the nose with a sharp object.. like the corner of a building, the engine is a killer for being wasted.<br><br>

In the Mission fair grind there is a stuntman that you can hit so his legs fall off! Whilst leg-less he will try to crawl using his arms! : )<br><br>

If you can find a load of big mammals (cows are best) use 2 pedestrian repulsificators, muchos points. Have Fun..<br><br>

On some levels [The USS Lewinsky in particular] make sure you know what LEVEL your opponents are on. They may be lurking Above or Below your Car...<br><br>

If you start with the dragster behind you, put the car in reverse and accelerate. Since this car has the shape of a ramp, you will drive on top/over him. As well as potentially wasting him it's cool to watch, and you get to have your own personal bodyguard infront of you when the mayhem starts!!!<br><br>

Get the instant handbrake, and drive fast on a road that goes up! When the road goes down or staight ahead, you`ll proberbly be flying by now. If you are lucky, you`ll be landing near a ped. Hold space juuuust before you hit the ground, so if your car is spinning in the air you will slash through him like some ninja-star. Giving you SERIOUS style points..(It's really hard to perfect, but it's worth it!)<br><br>

The RC car (available in the files section) can fit under most cars... think mine shitting. = )<br><br>

On Beaver Mountains try to get up the Bridges arches. On the one hand there are 60 Pedestrian Flame Throwers, on the other Gravity from Jupiter and so on. If you have problems getting on, drive in a wall, so your front will be smashed in. Its now much easier!<br><br>

In order to max out your car's potential power, armor, and engine, replay races over and over again. Group 3 is a good one, as the 3-new-slot powerup is easy to find in Beaver Woods, and the respective power-ups to fill the slots are easy as well. Just keep doing that race using a small, easily manuverable car, get the power-ups every time, and kill your opponents using the wide-spread repulsificators available on the level. It takes awhile, but when you're done, you can move on to the hard, later missions with a maxed-out car.<br><br>

When pitted against the big yellow dump truck, the first dead end alley has a Granite Car Barrell - snatch it up and go head on with the truck - this should kill it instantly.<br><br>

The Carma2 cd can be changed for a music cd of your choice. (though it has to be 8 tracks or above)! Though it sometimes crashes when I shut the game down after an hour of play, so change it back before closing. A favourite choice for me is the Easy Rider soundtrack, lots of good driving music and Born to be wild by Steppenwolf is played alot by the Carma2 music selector. Sets the mood, I can tell you! Any Cypress Hill also plays well and I suppose there is no reason not to use the acoustically superior Carma1 cd. Have fun.<br><br>

If you slam into some one at full speed, then hit openent repulsificator you can do double damage! Just make sure he stays close enough for the repulsificator work.<br><br>

On the level "Beaver Woods" find the waterfall and drive into it, to find the underground mine!<br><br>

If you have a Ninja pc you can increase the YON factor and the YON level. (these are some of the options in particular text files) By increasing them more of the scenery will appear, but it will use up a lot of power.<br><br>

If you go into the general.txt, under data.twt and change the number of links in the mutant tail you can have a much larger area with which to kill people.<br><br>

If you add weight to your car it is a wise idea to make yourself less soft too, as the extra weight means you do more damage when you crash<br><br>

If you edit any one of the cars speeds in eccess of 500Mph, make sure you have at 7-9 gears and have set engine strength to below 1 for maximum acceleration<br><br>

Try to master the drunk driving power-up because from what I've seen you get a lot more points when you kill peds. Forward is reverse and left is right and visa versa.<br><br>

Spend ages practising handbrake turns, and other cool but useful moves. Even if they aren't directly useful against computer opponents, when playing multiplayer it gives you a huge advantage if you know how your car is going to react.<br><br>

Just for fun, you can beat the huge yellow quarry truck with the little half tone yellow car. Just cheat yourself to loads of opponents repulsificators and go play ball with the 35 ton truck! Then finish him with granite car when youve had enough!<br><br>

If you get flung in the air during pinball mode. Recover to avoid getting wasted.<br><br>

On the mission level where you have to kill that single giant truck, you can get it to commit suicide. Drive forward till you are past a large building on the right and pull in behind the trees in the following park. The truck bee-lines straight for you, smashes into the large trees, which make a ramp as they collapse, sending the truck overhead and smashing dead into the building behind you. Game over. [At least, that is what appeared to happen, much to my surprise.]<br><br>

I have recently been editing several settings in Camargeddon 2's *.txt and I found that by reducing rolling resistance on all 4 wheels and increasing the traction multiplier you can hit 600MPh and stop in a matter a seconds <br><br>

If you get major air in the Delorian, open your doors and you can often glide further.. but you might end up tumbling end over end in the air. = )<br><br>

In the ped.txt file you can edit it so you get as much time and money you want from killing just 1 ped. (I set it so it gives me 3 hrs and 30,000,000 per ped!)<br><br>

Need some Credits? If so head to the Beaver City Bank, and go for a ride in the safe. It's a bit tricky getting out of the small entrance, but worth it!<br><br>

Type in "FRYFRY" about 100 or so times for the ped flamethrower, and just drive around roasting people. You get heaps of money for each person you toast.<br><br>

Rather then having a lot of trouble editing files: just stop the timer when you need more time to complete a mission!<br><br>

On Rocky Too drive from the tunnel up the hill and if you go fast enough and then stop before flying of the cliff you will find a secret room over the bridge on the right with free slots + power tokens<br><br>

Use a kangeroo jump to jump on opponents when you have solid granite car. They'll turn into pizza's! Huhuhuh!!<br><br>

The big black semi is most vulnerable from the side.. so smash it there with a solid granite car for an instant kill<br><br>

To turn round quickly at high speed and do it with style, hold down the Z key and hold the throttle down for another 2 seconds till the car starts to spin. Finally hold the handbrake down and the car will come to a perfect halt facing the opposite direction.<br><br>

There's one mission where you have to destroy some guns, a power-plant and an evil-admiral. The best car you can use is the plow mk2 cause it's heavy. But if you've got some lighter car just pick up the black powerup barrels. They tend to give you the solid granite car powerup. Once you've got all the guns go to the powerplant. If you can't go through the iron bars, just go to the right.. Behind a glass wall there's a solid granite car powerup. Finally, the Admiral is hard to reach... Close to the control-tower, there's a red box that gives you the electro zapper powerup. Get behind the control tower, use 2 or more kangeroo powerups (you'll find some if you're going to the power-plant) And the admiral will get his ass fryed!! MISSION COMPLETE!!!!!<br><br>

At the mission on the USS Lewinsky, you can pick-up 30 slaughter mortars near the control-tower which keep coming back. There's nothing more fun than shooting some innocent pedestrians with bombs!!!<br><br>

When you start out a race in the front of the pack, go at medium speed until close to wall; press the retrieve button, and you`ll come right in behind of all your opponents, giving you the opportunity to smash them into the wall.<br><br>

When airborne, type 'TILTY' for pinball-mode, and just before the pinball-mode wears out type it again to get as long airborne as you want. When in the air start shittin' some mines (Type 'DIDEDODI') for great effect!! It's like you're bombarding the peds below you! Doing this with the 'Supastuka' has the most realistic effect. (It's hard to perfect, but it kicks ass!!)<br><br>

Get loads of mines (Type 'didedodi') so you can lay a mine-field to hurt some peds, or trap some opponents. But be carefull that you don't get some mines up your own arse!<br><br>

After getting the 'mutant tail thing' powerup, release it and if hits a pedestrian AFTER you've let it go, you get 'An award for outstanding skill' which is about 50,000!!!!<br><br>

In the last mission destroy all of the cylinders (the ones that are aranged in a circle) then hit recover until you are at the begining of the mission. this will give you a couple of extra minutes to finish the mission. this also works on the battle ship just hit recover until you are back on the top deck. <br><br>

There are several points in the Beaver County Quarry level where you can push yer opponent off a cliff and onto explosives. Its funny to wait at the top of the cliff, hear the explosion and see a piece of yer enemy fly by.<br><br>

Have some fun with the Granite car... Ram the train real fast and send it off track! (difficult), move rocks onto the track, or for fun get the rock rolling over the other cars and peds! Oh, and get a Jumbo up to 100mph by pushing it, then watch that baby crash into oponents!<br><br>

Type in MRMAINWARING, TAKEMETAKEME and FASTBAST. Then just drive in the middle of some peds (I prefer West Side Gory) and blow the horn. Watch them all run to your car fast enough to launch themselves and die, mucho grande points and fun to watch (zoomout for best viewing!!!)<br><br>

If you are trying to destroy the opponents, then drive in front of them and then reverse quickly. In other words simply go into the opposite direction. When you see the bastard coming wait for him to appear in your view and then speed up and kill. If he doesn't die then recover and go again<br><br>

If youv'e got a lot of Kangaroo On Command powerups then you can drive upside down inside building etc. When you get turned upside down on your roof use the Kangaroos repeatedly until your wheels touch the ceiling. Keep using the Kangaroos rapidly and also drive forward. Its really cool and you should get a Cunning Stunt Bonus.<br><br>

In Max's Junkyard, it's fun to go all the way south-east and face north, or all the way north-west and face east, and accelerate towards that hill, apply the afterburner to gain about 200mph, and as the road-hill acts as a ramp, slinging you into the air, you get about 20-30 seconds airtime. It's really fun, especially when you land on a ped (hard to accomplish and rare) or you spin around in the air... :)<br><br>

When you hit a drunk driving powerup, toggle into the cockpit and back out, you are now looking at the front of the car. Now you can just drive normally, only the car will be going backwards.<br><br>

You get an "Extra Style Bonus" for reversing into a ped. It also works if your using the ped ray whilst reversing, which enables you to get some of the biggest bonuses imaginable. Another good idea with the ped ray is to get airborne (Artistic Impression Bonuses)<br><br>

When on "Bob slay", go as fast as you can of the piste, and then try to land on a ped! Super splatter!<br><br>

Hitting the "s" button twice works like a CD track selector. It's completely random, but keep doing it till you get to your favorite track!!<br><br>

Watch out for the combination of tunnels and pinball mode! It's often a deadly one...once I was cut into 3 pieces! That must of hurt!<br><br>

In Max's Junkyard Level, near one of the starting places, there is an empty lot full of peds. There, you can get the Ethereal and Suicidal Peds powerups, followed by a Pinball Mode. Stop, sit, and wait. Your car will be filled with peds, and when Ethereal Peds wears off, hijinks will ensue.<br><br>

On USS Lewinsky. On the 2nd level there is a pinball mode powerup. Think big planes...bouncing around. Definitely worth a look.<br><br>

If you bought the Supastuka then the best level to use it is on the fairground. There are mostly big wide spaces in the central area dn lost of opputunities to get airborne!!<br><br>

On the USS Lewinsky get about 50 kanagroo on commands and jump on the control tower for some bonus points and ped electro bastard ray.<br><br>

To kill a lot of opponents very quickly, use the pinball cheat as the count-down starts and quickly follow it with the opponent repulsificator cheat and hit fire.... you can just fit the two cheats in, befor the race starts. for the best results do this when a race starts in a tunnel.<br><br>

Turning on the magnets in Max's yunkyard gives great effect! (Go to Options.txt in the data folder and change the RussellsFannies 0 into a 1.) Try to cling an opponent on the magnet, then get solid granite car, (type: 'BIGTWAT') and get under 'em! now you'll be lifted up and the 3   dimensional shape of your opponent will become 2 dimensional!! Whahaha.. <br><br>

If your goig to go into a wall at massive speeds, and don't have time to recover before you'll hit it, try and do a handbrake turm. Hopefully, you'll hit the wall flatly and walk away with almost no damage what so ever. You can often save yourself from being wasted this way!<br><br>

Here's something cool to try: Get suicidal peds,(TAKEMETAKEME) and mines (DIDEDODI), and a instant handbrake. When airborne, lay a mine just before you hit the ground, and hit the brakes(And hold 'em). The momentum of the mine will swing it upto your arse, and your car will be spinning and twisting in the air, but it isn't moving. Now the peds will walk towards your car, and they'll be squished, chopped and splatted givin' you a shitload of credits. It's difficult, but hilarious!<br><br>

Want to have some fun? In the level with the train, play as a semi-large vehicle (I.E. the plow), use the pinball cheat and the solid granite car cheat. Then ram the train for some strange but cool results. <br><br>

Bigger is not always better. Loggerhead and the Big Truck seem to be quite fragile, especially when going under low obstacles. The best universal vehicle by far is "The Plow Mk 2" is is strong and heavy enough to do serious damage to all opponents but it is still fast and is built low to go under checkpoints. You can even see over it in external camera view!<br><br>

If you want to earn more credits to buy a expensive car, a smart thing to do is not to kill your opponents with one crash! Try to crash into them without killing them and you will recieve lots of money!<br><br>

Every minute you get by the end of each race equals 1000 credits.<br><br>

When heading toward a group of powerups, hit the spacebar and try to slide into them sideways and get them all at the same time. It saves a lot of time when you're in the mood for destruction.
<br><br>
If you are in the desert and see the space ships, find some kangaroo on commands and then jump up on to the space ship! When you get there you will get a message saying  "Greetings earthlings! AGhhh!"
<br><br>
You can go into the pyramids in the 'I want to bereave' level by driving on top of them (difficult). Once inside, you can play Alien-Eliminator, by killing the extraterrestrials.. it's pretty cool to cause an intergalactic crisis... Mwahahahaaaaa!!
<br><br>
For easy credits do the mission where you fight the big truck and type in "bigtwat" and "tilty" right when the race starts. He will get wasted right away.
<br><br>
The MOST fun you can have at the airport - Get to the parked planes / copters, hopefully bringing along most of your opponents. Using TILTY and BIGTWAT get the Pinball Mode and the Solid Granite Car. Then ram as many planes as you can in the front wheels before the Granite Car runs out. Just before Pinball Mode runs out, keep bringing it back and watch in glee as peds, windows and your opponents get smashed and crushed by the bouncing planes, but watch from a safe distance. In addition to being loads of fun it makes GREAT replay movies!!!!
<br><br>
Try exchanging the car files in the full game (once untwatted) with those in the demo. In addition to exchanging cars you can use the same cars but mix the new and old physics files to create some cool effects - I once got the Volvo hovering on the ground with its wheels in mid-air above the cab...And it still worked properly!!!
<br><br>
This isn't a big 'tip' or 'tactic', but you've got to remember once you own the Big Dump use it often on big, open levels (where he will reign supreme).. and see just how mangled you can make your opponents with a 35-ton dump truck! I once turned Mother Trucker into a near-ball of twisted black steel! Mwuahahahaha!
<br><br>
In the count down before the race starts you can type in cheats like "BIGTWAT" which gives you solid granite car! This will prevent the big cars from ramming as soon as the race starts.
<br><br>
Get the sucicidal peds powerup and pinball mode, then wait for loads of peds to get close to you car. When loads are all gathered round open the door for hilarious effects. There was so much blood I could hardly see!
<br><br>
Using fly mode, you can discover all the stuff you couldn't find before. The hard part is managing to get it to work...
<br>
for the edit cheat mode use the f4 button to switch between option mode and cheat mode and use f1-f12 for numerous cheats along with the numbers in cheat mode.
<br><br>
A cheat with lots of s in it (such as 'STIFFSPASM") is difficult to use when the music is on, cause the s-button is also used as a switch for the music.. Just turn the music of, (not the soud-effects) to make those cheats workin'!
<br><br>
You can act as a real Stuka bomber by choosing the Supastuka, and type the fly mode cheat. Then cheat jourself 2 a mine shittin' mode of biblical proportions, and bombard the cars below ya!! I once splitted Mother trucker this way! (A stuka bombarded his targets by divin' right ahead 'o 'em!)
<br><br>
Get cheats mode, press alt-3 and alt-2 and you will have really awsome hydrolics!!!
<br><br>
When flying on some levels using the Fly Mode cheat it is easy to get confused as there is no clipping - But if this happens hit '5' on the numeric keypad to be returned to the ground with your wings!
<br><br>
Try to go flying with some massive cars sch as Psycho Pitbull's Big Dump. It is great fun!
<br><br>
When Fly Mode is on you can go around without the clip but this effect is not in the Action Replay. Go UNDERNEATH the map using, say, the Supastuka and then fly up wards. It makes a replay movie as if you are appearing out of the ground and is great if you go through a car or ped as you do...!
<br><br>
Get a mutant tail thing and some kangaroo on commands and suicidal peds when there all coming use a kangaroo on command for some bloody points
<br><br>
Another car u can use the flying mode with is U-Fool by errol.  Looks kinda cool with a spaceship!!
<br><br>
In the early levels delay buying a new car for as long as possible so that you have enough money to buy one of the bigger cars when they come along. It's recommended you don't buy a car until around mission 5.
<br><br>
For Fun: If you are in cheat mode (LAPMYLOVEPUMP), press Shift-3 continuously and you will find your car will become nothing but a little chunk of metal with 4 wheels.
<br><br>
The easiest way I've found to kill the dump truck at the end of group 4, is to just use the plane and drive straight at it. I didn't need to collect anything and did this a few times to make sure it wasn't a fluke. If you do have any problems though (like you don't own the plane yet) just grab the granite car powerup at the start and it should still be just as easy.
<br><br>
Use the lapmylovepump cheat then give yourself 20 or 30 mines to shit.... then go to a crowded area. Now do shift 4 and hit alt in the air to "rain" mines on helpless peds... = )
<br><br>
On any of the Max stages (junkyard etc.) there's quick and easy ways to gain some serious credits. Work out a circuit to collect as many of the powerups as possible in as short a time as possible. A copy of the circuit I use is available.. here! It's for use in the Junkyard level in group 4 and it earns you 1,000,000+ credits in 20-30 minutes without cheating. After doing the level a couple of times, you should easily have enough cash to buy the dumper truck at the end of the 4th mission for some serious fun against the tiny opposition. :o)
<br><br>
There is a secret room in Beaver Woods. To find it you have to use the fly cheat: IWISHICOULDFLYRIGHTUPTOTHESKY Then you can fly through walls and houses.
Now, fly into the railway-tunnel witch is going south, or down, on the map. Take a left turn in the mittle of the tunnel, and there it is!
<br><br>
After typing 'LAPMYLOVEPUMP' use shift, capslock and 6 very often to get a crapload of slaughter mortars so you can shoot yer opponents. They will often shred 2 pieces!
<br><br>
For extra carnage, go to the Airport Level and push obstacles (barriers or destroyed opponents) into the middle of the runway. The sit back and wait for the inevitable plane crash!
<br><br>
For really wacky fun, go to the round room in the Nuke Plant with all the gas cylinders and lure in as many opponents as you can. Then put on Pinball Mode and Lunar Gravity and hit them with Opponent Repulsification. Keep the Lunar Gravity and Pinball Mode going and more and more loose objects will bounce all over the room.
<br><br>
Open the doors to the lower decks on the Lewinsky: I stumbled across this playing after trying to open the door on the hangar deck on the Lewinsky during races (not during the mission). Here's how I did it. 1) Get a car that is near indestructible ( i used an eagle with a hacked twt file softness set at 0.0001 and mass of 15 tons), 2) activate Solid Granite Car and Pinball Mode, 3) Gently nudge the door, it will start bouncing (it helps to have Suicidal Peds as they are more than willing to jump under the door to really get it going), 4) the door will just about disappear, drive through carefully and have fun on the lower decks.
<br><br>
If you get drunk driving, just turn your keyboard around! = )
<br><br>
On the Junkyard Levels, you can make craploads of money. As well as going on the roofs you can go underground for more money than you can handle.
<br><br>
When you use the Slaughter Mortar you can produce far more accurate injuries to pedestrians by using the giant pedestrian cheat. You can get close and aim for a loss of arms or decapitation. Or you can use longer range shots to roll bombs at their legs, and they hop off or become totally legless. 
<br><br>
If the game will not run on your cd-rom drive, try using the cd2crack program(Means you don't have to insert the cd-can be found on various web pages) this will make the CD run (Well it did for me)
<br><br>
If your on the floor at your side or upside down,best thing to do is to press z and keep pressing it until your on your wheels again.
<br><br>
In the Carpocalypse Now mission,cheat yourself a Mutant Tail Thing(LAPMYLOVEPUMP then press Alt+Shift+1)and do doughnuts by the tanks so you don't explode when you hit them.
<br><br>
Its fun to get the Star Wars Speeder (available in the files section of this site), switch to inside the cockpit, cheat yourself a bunch of mines, get Greased Shoes, Giant Peds, and Dismemberfest, (ctrl-shift-2, 2, 3, and ctrl shift 7) and test your aim :)
<br><br>
When drivin' off someting huge, your car often lands on it's roof. You can avoid this by doing a U-turn juuuust before you drive off. Now your car will be spinning in the air, but it will land on it's wheels!
It'll save you a lot of recoveries, and sometimes you'll get a cunning stunt!!
<br><br>
It's possible...It's possible to split the 35 ton truck!! I took the piranha, cheated myself to a goddamn' load o' slaughter mortars.(Shift capslock 6) I wounded the truck so he had like 80% or so, and i pumped nearly all my bombs in him!! (Like 200 or so) And so he splitted. Looks kinda cool, such a big truck cut'n half!!
<br><br>
On USS Lewinsky, cheat yourself 2 a goddamn load o' slaughter mortars, and uhh,use fly-mode!
Now you can go into a dog-fight with F14s!! Guess you're playing airmageddon now, instead 'o carmageddon!
<br><br>
Do you feel the need for serious speed? Then place the following in powerup file (highlight all the stuff that is already there and click paste). I have had this running at 2000MPh and it is still stable. It also hits 500Mph in 0.3 seconds 
<br><br>
Afterburner!<br>
afterburner // Icon<br>
0 // Fizzle type<br>
30 // Time limit (-1 instantaneous, 0 whole race, x seconds)<br>
20 // Initial value for keyboard operable powerups (zero if not key operable, positive if time in seconds, negative if number of uses)<br>
9 // Action index<br>

Weird/Cool Bugs and Easter Eggs<br><br>
</h3>
Try getting about 30 or so kangaroo's on command and use them all very quickly.. you'll go flying up in the air and about 2 minutes or so later you'll come flying down.. you usually dont get wasted after rentering the earth's atmosphere.. weird huh?
<br><br>
While playing if you have your rear quarter panels torn off, pull over to the pieces lying on the floor and tap the brakes and the brake lights still work, when they are disconnected from the car!
<br><br>
Some times when the peds have the "big heads" powerup you can splat the body away and leave their bloated head in mid-air!!
<br><br>
If you knock a pedestrian off a tall building, it will die. However, if you drive off the building so that you can still see it when it hits the ground, it will not die.
<br><br>
If you get the opponent repulsificator and solid granite car, you will go flying off instead of your opponent when you use the repulsificator
<br><br>
When playing on "Nice Beaver" (UK Version) there are various ramps going under small bridges in the city, push clone cars to the top of thease ramps and they will sink into the ground so you can only see the rectangular roof shape in the road!
<br><br>
If you smash the ice statue of a bear in the Beaver mountains a message appears saying "I bet that's the last time he shits in the woods"
<br><br>
There are problems with the Videologic 3dx with regards to the mani menu text and HUD. I have found out from SCI that this is a known bug and a patch should be available sometime in the next week or so.
<br><br>
If you flip on your top continiously open and close the doors. You will begin to slowly get shorter because your roof get's crashed in! it may not be a bug but it's cool to do!
<br><br>
After Blood patch installation many power ups still contain word "zombie" (+ it is in the track description on the main menu)
<br><br>
If your roof gets cut off, sometimes your drivers head comes off with it.
<br><br>
I have a 3D Blaster Banshee, and on the menus, the cursor won't go all the way around the screen?
<br><br>
The same graphics bug mentioned above applies to the Matrox m3D cards. Apparently SCi have acknowledged this and a patch is under development?
<br><br>
As it says in the readme file of Carmageddon 2, Voodo rush based 3d cards have the same problem. The cursor won't go all around the screen, so you've got to use the cursor keys, tab and whatever.
<br><br>
If you are experiencing problems with the mouse not reaching the whole screen in the menus, the advice I got from SCi was to resize the desktop to 640x480 before starting Carma2. This seems to work?
