<p>Welcome to the new Burning official clan site.  We are a elite group of Age of Empires gamers and strive to be the best.  At the same time we have fun.  Since Dashdogs retirment we needed a new official Burning site so I steped up and have done the impossible :)<BR><BR>

<H3>See ya Raven__!</H3>
<font size="2"> - Posted by Burning_BlueGil</Font><BR><BR>
<H5>Raven__ has chosen to leave the Burning Clan and AoE.  He was a friend, a cool guy, and was arguably the best Burning ever.  He was a +2000 player and was known throughout all of DM.  He has chosen to quit, because he was to busy and was tired of playing the same game for over a year.  He has said when he does come on to play he will be on as Burning_Raptor but we can take him off the members page.  He has said that hes giving Cow his Burning_TinyFoo name and Ono_ his Burning_Raven__ name which I think is a big mistake.  C ya Raven__!</H5>
<H3>New Recruiting System?</H3>
<font size="2"> - Burning_BlueGil</Font><BR><BR>
<H5>This is a perfect time for us to get the new recruiting system up after Raven__'s resignation.  I prefer the _Lost_ clan has.  It's more professional and so the people that want in don't get frustraited by having to play nine or so Burnings just to get in.  The other way was frogs_ idea about having half the clan vote for a person to get in.  That is just to many games that the person has to play in order to join.  All we need is a five person recruiting system that should be:  CoolCat, BlueGil, frog_, Crow, and HiPPo.  I say HiPPo, because he is a good player and he has a lot of hook-ups for the clan.  He is also on more than any other Burning except for me.  And in the new recruiting policy the person thats trying out will need at least a 3-2 vote's in his favor.</H5>
<H3>New Burning site!</H3>
<Font size="2"> - Burning_BlueGil</Font><BR><BR>
<H5>I will be making a site dedicate just to Burning for a number of reasons.  One is so ya'll don't have to go through all the links and stuff, another is because there is a lot of people that want me to do this.</H5>
<H3>DashDogs New Clan!</H3>
<Font size="2"> - Burning_BlueGil</Font><BR><BR>
<H5>DashDog has come up with a awesome idea that I'm looking forward to.  He is making a clan called <a href="http://members.tripod.com/FrozenClan/">Frozen Clan</A> which is a RoR clan that is a expansion off of Burning I like this idea for a number of reason's:<BR>
<LI>We can make the web pages exactly the same, but Burning will be warm colors and only talks about Burning, but is linked up with the Freezen site.  That site is cool colors and talks about the Freezen clan.<BR>
<LI>We have seperate caps limit.<BR>
<LI>If people want to leave AoE and want to play RoR you can still be with Burning, but you will be in the Freezen clan.<BR>
<LI>We can see which sections are better like Burning vs. Freezen wars in both AoE and RoR to be fair.<BR>
<LI>Hopefully since Burning is well known that it will make getting the Freezen clan powerful quick.
<H3>Me and Rhino got screwed in Tourny!</H3>
<Font size="2"> - Posted by Burning_BlueGil</Font><BR><BR>
<H5>Rhino and I came in 3rd place in the Addicted 2 tourney which I might add was a total bust.  Anyways we beat the first 2 people then we went to second round.  CrAzY_DoHnut_ and Budweisser_6PK came in the room and said host talk us to start.  At first I rushed CrAzY really good but he towered up and I lost ground fast.  He would have killed my town but I make a lot of siege workshops fast and towers and smacked his legions down.  Rhino was manhandling Budweisser_6PK but CrAzY gave him some problems.  We ended up gaining 3/4 the map and they ran outa resources.  Then they said that they were gonna nuke us and they laughed.  All the sudden we got dropped.  Then when we told the host he said that they weren't in tourney and we got kicked outa the tourney.  We should have won it all but we had to get the third spot!</H5>
<H3>Dolphins back!</H3>
<Font size="2"> - Posted by Burning_BlueGil</Font><BR><BR>
<H5>Dolphin has decided to come back to the Burning clan.  He really wanted in and I tried to get him in at first.  Then frog_ said that he wanted him back in.  I told CoolCat but he ignored me like usual.  Then crow talked to him and they let him back into clan.  His new Burning name is Burning_Barracuda.</H5>

<H3>New Recruit!</H3>
<font size="2"> - Posted by Burning_BlueGil</Font><BR><BR>
<H5>All welcome Burning_Rat_ who is formally known as NS_Xerxes and _Xerxes__.  He has shown that he really wanted in Burning and is on often.  He beat Burning_Dolphin in less than 20 minutes and has beaten me also.  He is a Hittite player but he can also play Choson.  He will definitly bring the total package with him to Burning.</H5>
<BR>
<H3>More people!</H3>
<font size="2"> - Posted by Burning_BlueGil</Font><BR><BR>
<H5>IAMEXPERT and El_Splat (AkA Booger_Snot, _Viper_Snot_) want in badly.  They are both extreamly good chosons and if you see them give them a hollar.</H5>
<BR>
<H3>We need to boot!</H3>
<font size="2"> - Posted by Burning_BlueGil</Font><BR><BR>
<H5>We need to start booting some people right away.  Lemming, Hound, Roc, and some others need to be booted.  Roc hasn't been seen in over 2 weeks now.  I feel that he has run for it.</H5>

<H3>New Recruit!</H3>
<font size="2"> - Posted by Burning_BlueGil</Font><BR><BR>
<H5>Welcome our new recruit Burning_Rhino.  He is formally known as _Viper_Leader_ or Senior_Ceasar.  HiPPo, frog__, and we have played Senior in many 1v1 battles.  We never beat Senior, but they were all really close matches.  He is most definitly Burning material and comes on every night.  I let him in because I read what CoolCat said about letting RedTail in because DashDog, Frog, and somebody else wanted him in.  So frog__, HiPPo, and I have choson to let him in.  This wasn't a one person desision and this will not hurt Burning in any way except bring in more tallent and more respect for our clan.</H5>

<H3>Fairwell to Hamster!</H3>
<font size="2"> - Posted by Burning_BlueGil</Font><BR><BR>
<H5>So long Burning_Hamster, I never knew you that well, matter of fact I never played a game with you.  I wish you the best of luck in your AoE future.</H5>
<H3>The last two weeks!</H3>
<font size="2"> - Posted by Burning_BlueGil</Font><BR><BR>
<H5>Burning in the past couple of weeks have experienced several stressful situations.  When DashDog resigned there were several mixed opinions.  Dolphin left to play solo, Chettah also left to play by himself, PitBuLL left for the Brut clan, Yak is with the _Lost_ clan, and several more have threatened to quit.  Then shortly after we had a huge infestation of fakes in our Burning clan.  I personally delt with Burning_BenGal and Burning_soldier (aka Burning_Thief).  WDragon then went on a recruiting frenzy who picked up Burning_Hound and Burning_Jaguar.  I also did some spy work and found out that WDragon is in the _40_Thieves clan which sent Burning_soldier to take over our clan.  Soldier said that WDragon is the new leader of Burning for now on.  After I found out this shit I scared off that thief guy and I would like to talk with WDragon to see what thats all about.  Now to a lighter note Burning looks better than ever.  We have plenty of recruiting room and I have found two awesome players that want in Burning bad.  Which are EDP_Synthesis_ and Senior_Ceasar.  They have killed me in 1v1's so we need them in the clan.  Also in my opinion we can't afford people into Burning who never come online.  There are still some guys that Raven should take into consideration about removing from the clan, but I will keep my mouth shut on that.</H5>


<H3>Recruiting system!</H3>
<font size="2"> - Posted by Burning_BlueGil</Font><BR><BR>
<H5>We need a new recruiting policy instead of one person doing the recruiting.  Its not fair to the others who have friends that want in when others let there friends in with no regard to the Burning clan.  Once again I will not call out names.  I think we should tryout the _Lost_ clans recruiting policy.  We need five elected staff members who will tryout the person that wants in.  The majority of votes wins.  If we get this going, more xperts will come because people don't like it when only one person does the tryouts its to easy to get into clans.  UNC and a lot of other top clans do sort of the same thing.  The five members should be people that come on often and have some type of power in the clan.  My picks would be Bunring_Raven_, Burning_CoolCat, Burning_frog__, Burning_BlueGil, and Burning_Grizzly.  Those are just my opinions.  I'm not sure about Grizzly because he isn't on that often any more and he did say that he is gonna quit when Burning is back to its old self again.  I elect me because I have been a clan leader twice in my life the BK clan and the MK clan.  I make the web site witch is a major pain in my life so I think I should be awarded plus I believe I am a good player.  Many xperts know me and have been wanting into the clan that havn't been givin a fair chance.  If we can get this going I will make a page for the people who are trying out.  It will have the five Burnings names and underneath it has the people who are wanting to join.  It will say if we vote for him in or don't  If three out of the five members agree to let him in that person will be a Burning.  I seriously think that we should do this.  CoolCat you have the power to do this so please try this out.</H5><BR><BR><BR>
