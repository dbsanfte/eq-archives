The reason being is that it wasn't until I was level 10 that someone explained to me just how the Specialization points work. Now, granted this is a bit different from the melees because they need to have more than one skill for combat, but let me say it just the same. As a matter of fact, I think this pertains to Eldritches more than anyone else in the game.<br>
<br>
First of all, your specialization points that you get every time you level, there is a set amount of these. At level 50, you will have gotten a certain number of points to use and then you are done after that. So, the reason I got screwed is because I did not know this. I was putting points into each of my magic lines because I didn't know what each line offered, and had no idea I would be screwed from checking them all out. So basically what happened is that I was keeping all my magic specializations (Mana, Light, Void) about even. Because of this, I was ending up about 3 spell levels behind at level 12. I only had access to a level 9 spell in my specialization magic line because since I hadn't focused my points, I wasn't advancing ahead to my level in any spell line. After checking out what each magic line offered, I decided to go with Mana magic (which gives me access to the Vacummancy line of spells - dd/snares, disease). I checked it out, and the only spell I would end up not having is my level 50 snare/dd. I didn't care too much about that, but I realized that I would also always be 3 levels behind or so when it came to new spells. Which would be my end every time in a rvr (realm vs realm) situation.<br>
<br>
Bleh.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I know this was confusing, but just check out this site and you will see what I mean. Click on the Character Builder.<br>

They really should have explained this better, I think a lot of people are going to be screwed later on and have to restart. It can be very hard to decide what you want to do because you have to think of pvp as well as hunting. For example, let's take a Nightshade (rogue). Do you want to be a dual wielding, poisoning, melee rogue? A backstabbing, poisoning rogue? A best at stealth/backstabber rogue? Etc, etc, etc. You can't have them all, and you have to decide beforehand what you want to be, or you will end up a level 50 Nightshade who has the Stealth skill of a level 30. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub30.ezboard.com/uencan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Encan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 5<br> <font color=#333333>(10/17/01 6:48:58 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: DAoC players might want to read this. =) (&lt;-- Xiltin </span><hr size=1> Wow, thnx for the heads up.

Here's my take on it.  If caster you generally get your level's worth of points every level (3 pts at lv 3, 50 pts at lv 50).  However, the cost of improving your specialization level also goes up.  It's confusing, but here are some guidelines.<br>
<br>
(1) You're going to have to choose to make some of your abilities stronger than others.<br>
<br>
(2) The strongest they can be is equal to your level, HOWEVER, all classes are set up and balanced to be right with specializations at 2/3 your level.  The extra 1/3 you could get is there so people can get super strong in something if they want to.  <br>
<br>
(3) Since the points you get increase every level, it's fairly easy to correct mistakes in your lower levels.<br>
<br>
(4) For the points it would cost you to spec one line to your level, you can spec TWO lines to 2/3.  (I know it sounds crazy, but I checked it).<br>
<br>
(5) So for an eldritch, you have 3 lines to choose from, and enough points to spec ONE to level.  That'll make you very one-sided.  A better approach is 2 lines to 2/3 (which will get you to a good point in both lines).<br>
<br>
(6) Note that the spell lists are still being added to, by the way.<br>
<br>
(7) If you rather like all 3 lines, you can take the points for one of the 2/3 lines and split it between the other two and spec them to 1/2 (also not bad).  You'd be good in a lot of different situations (solo, group, rvr, etc.).  That's the theory.<br>
<br>
I'll summarize:  <br>
<br>
Eldritch could go Mana 1 Light 0 Void 0 or something like that, which would leave you with only the base spells in the two you didn't spec;<br>
<br>
Or Mana 2/3 Light 2/3 Void 0, two balanced lines with only base spells in the last, or<br>
<br>
Mana 2/3 Light 1/2 Void 1/2, or some variation on that.<br>
<br>

However, if you do more than one as a caster, you are screwed. That is all there is to it.<br>
<br>
Yeah, you can get 2 different lines up to 2/3 SKILL LEVEL, but that does not necessarily mean the spells you have from that level are 2/3 your max. Which, for example an Eldritch, means that at level 50 with 2 lines specialized, you will have 35 skill points in each one. This will leave you at level 50 with 2 lines of specializations, where your highest spells from both specializations are just barely level 30 or a bit higher spells.<br>
<br>
Which in turn, means that the spell isn't going to do jack to any level 40+ mob, or player character. Even if you did manage to get the spell to land, it would do little, if any at all damage or effect.<br>
<br>
You have to specialize in one line if you are in it for the long game. Even if you are not, yeah at level 50, both lines will be in the 30's level, but up until level 50, you will constantly be LEVELS behind in spells and will suck in groups, and MAJORLY in rvr/pvp.<br>
<br>
So, even though you would still be fine, because all of your base spells level up automatically ( you wouldn't be useless), it's just that your specialized spells (where the effects and damage really show) will be of little to no use. So, I guess you wouldn't be all the way screwed, but technically you would be.<br>
<br>
In my opinion, it's still one specialization all the way. At least for an Eldritch, and any caster for that matter.<br>
<br>
Also, the only lines you get &quot;base&quot; spell upgrades automatically are the ones you start with. Eldritches get automatic upgrades to their base lines - Sun, Moon, and Eclipse - you get no &quot;base&quot; spells in specialization at all. Meaning, if you don't put any points in it, there are no spells. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub30.ezboard.com/ucorellionseladrine.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Corellion Seladrine</A> at: 10/20/01 8:00:29 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub30.ezboard.com/ugermish.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Germish</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://i1.yimg.com/1/1fa/tn_1e.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Sentinent Wanderer</span><br>  Posts: 212<br> <font color=#333333>(10/21/01 6:57:32 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://i1.yimg.com/1/1fa/tn_34.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: DAoC players might want to read this. =) (&lt;-- Xiltin </span><hr size=1> Sorry Gnome Boy, I got to take Sent's side on this one (well .... for the most part).  I feel most spell classes should move points around to different areas because you get &quot;free&quot; lines of spells that go up even if you put no point into them.  <br>
<br>
But Gnome boy has a point about the Eldritches I feel.  They should pick one and stick to it.  An Eldritches number one job seems to be destorying a target fast and as messy as they can (body parts going everywhere) and they can do that best by picking one and sticking to it.<br>
