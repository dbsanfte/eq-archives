The reason for this? We really didn't <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> have</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> any guild policy. Sure, we had the charter, but that basically says that we're to be honorable at all times. What we were looking to create was a guide that states what is expected of guild members (aside from honor). The contents of the guide shouldn't be anything new to most of our members, so don't think we're doing a complete turn-around on you.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   It's merely meant to spell certain things out to potential recruits, and also clarify some things for our current members, who may be unsure as to how we would handle a certain situation.<br>
<br>
With that said, here's the guide. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Recruiting</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Often times, I hear in guildchat, &quot;Someone's interested in joining the guild. What do I do?&quot; Well, here's the answer. If you feel this person is worthy of being in <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> The Sentinent</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, give their name to one of the Recruiting Officers (RO) for the month, and they will refer the potential recruit to our <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.thesentinent.com">webpage</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->. A person is also required to have three recommendations from guild members before they are invited. Also, please put the potential recruit's name on our &quot;Recruiting&quot; board, along with their level, class, and usual hunting area, so our guild members know who to look out for as grouping partners.<br>
<br>
The RO position switches monthly, and it is announced at each guild meeting. If you are unsure of who the present month's RO is, check in the &quot;Guild News&quot; section of the message board. Their names will most likely be listed in the thread detailing the goings-on of the most recent guild meeting.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Officers</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
The current officers for <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> The Sentinent</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> are Galadrid, Taansey, Aonedil/Meudir, Ilrissa/Elmarra, Teynor, Caedere, Sentry, and Mustela. Contact any of these members if you have a problem with someone in the guild, or a question about the guild in particular.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Twinking</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Twinking is tolerated within the guild, but to a certain extent. We're not about to make a list of all the items in the game, and what level is &quot;too low&quot; for these items. Use your own discretion. However, some things are obvious. A level 1 monk dual-wielding Knuckle Dusters is a little excessive. <br>
<br>
In regards to twinking, please remember that it is not the responsibility of the guild to twink your alternate character(s). It is one thing to ask for help camping an item for your main character, but requesting help to get an item for an alternate is inappropriate. Use your own time to outfit your alternates, not the time of guildmates.  Furthermore, if an item drops on a guild-sponsored raid that your twink could use, please take into consideration the primary guild characters who could also use the item.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> A Note on Main and Alternate Characters</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Personally, I love my alternate characters, and we welcome alts in this guild. However, we distinguish between Mains and Alts in the use of some guild resources for the following reason -- Equality of Access to Resources is Based on Players, not Characters. Imagine that you have one character in the guild and I have six. Since all members have limits on their playing time, there's a limit to the number of all-guild item camps in a month. If all Characters (main and alt) have an equal call on that time, I would have six times the chance you would to benefit. If you figure that item hand-downs are also limited (and items are class-dependent), again, I would get a lot more items if all Characters are treated equally. The solution we chose is to limit some guild resources to Main Characters only. <br>
<br>
A case could be made that the guild gets more benefit from a variety of alts than from a player with only one character, but since the player behind them must then split his or her time among them, the benefit doesn't seem to outweigh the problem. <br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Teleports et al.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
There are quite a few members of <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> The Sentinent</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> who are capable of teleporting. Please remember, though, that they play the game for the same reason that you do: to have fun and enjoy themselves. If they are reduced to taxi status, this effectively ruins their gaming experience.<br>
<br>
So, how do you go about requesting a teleport? Simply ask in guildchat, &quot;Is anyone available for a teleport?&quot; If you receive no answer, assume that everyone is busy at the moment, and accept that you probably have to walk to your destination. Please, do not single out a member of the guild and ask them personally to teleport you. It may put an unnecessary amount of pressure on their shoulders because they may feel they are obligated to help a guild member. <br>
<br>
The same holds true for any service a guild member may be able to provide, such as resurrections, and other conveniences. Services such as these are not entitlements, and should never be expected as such. Keep in mind, also, that other people's time is not less important than your time, no matter if they are sitting around in East Commons, working on tradeskills, or soloing. It is no-one's place to judge whether another person is at liberty to provide a service to someone. That's their call.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Looting</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
This applies to both guild-only groups and outside of the guild. Pay attention to how loot is divided when you are grouping. If loot is being done in Master Loot fashion (where only one person in the group loots, and then periodically /splits the money), and you are not the Master Looter, do not loot. If loot is being done as FFA-Honor (where each person in the group loots freely, but allowing each group member equal opportunity to loot), do not hog all of the loot, especially if you are a melee character. The casters may be meditating at the time of the kill, and may not have an immediate opportunity to loot. Take only your fair share. If you have looted 10 corpses in a row before the mob's body has a chance to hit the ground, something is wrong. Furthermore, just because you keep /autosplit on and loot every corpse does not mean that every member of the group gets their fair share. Yes, group members will split the money fairly evenly, but items such as Fine Steel and gems will still be monopolized by one person. <br>
<br>
Guild groups usually loot by NBG/FFA-Honor, meaning that everyone loots their fair share, but if a valuable item drops, the class that can make best use of the item automatically gets the item. However, if a class-specific item drops, and no class that can use the item is present in the group, the item is usually /rolled on.<br>
<br>
As an aside, if you arrange a guild group in order to get a certain item for your main, do your best to ensure that the other members of the group get a little something, also. If you are camping a timed spawn with placeholders, perhaps you should allow the other members of the group to loot the placeholders. They're investing their time into helping you out. Try to be considerate of their kindness.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Uses of Guildchat</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> The Sentinent</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> has always been a friendly, chatty guild, and we will continue to be for as long as the guild is operational. Guildchat is often used as a medium to discuss topics that are entirely unrelated to the game. Much of this is accepted and embraced. However, if you notice that someone is being overly vulgar, obscene, and disrespectful in guildchat, please contact an officer. There is a different between friendly chatter and abuse of the channel.<br>
<br>
On the same topic, usually members of the guild will give a victory &quot;Woot!&quot; whenever they win an item of value. Please, do not ask if you can have the item, even if you intend to buy it. If the guild member wants to offer up the item, they will do so without encouragement. <br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Guild Treasury</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
The guild treasury is available to guild members only, as a means of bettering themselves without breaking the bank.<br>
<br>
The treasury is open to main characters only. If, at any time, you decide to switch the &quot;main&quot; status to another character, you must give any items you had on your other character back to the treasury. Furthermore, please note that continuously switching between your main and an alternate in order to allow other characters access to the treasury will be seen as abuse of the treasury, and all of your characters will be prohibited from using this convenience.<br>
<br>
The complete listing of rules for the treasury is located on the &quot;Treasury&quot; section of the message board. Please contact an officer if you need the password.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Selling of Guild-gotten Items</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
We are not here to police what you can and cannot sell to the general public. If you, personally, kill Pyzjn and get a GBS, it is your right to sell the item. You got the item yourself, therefore it is your choice what you do with it. However, if you decide to sell an item that several guild members helped you obtain, you may want to confer with these members before you sell the item. Remember, they invested their time in helping you get the item, and they may put you on their &quot;Never Again&quot; list when their past kindness has been sold for a profit.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Kill-stealing, Ninja-looting, etc.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
This one should be obvious, but just in case some may not be aware, we are not a guild who advocates the breaking of the Play Nice Policy (PnP).  (The PnP guildlines are located <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.everquest.com/support/conduct.jsp">here</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->.)  If any person is found to be breaking the rules of the PnP, be forewarned that it may mean your permanent expulsion from <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> The Sentinent</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.<br>
<br>
That is to say, if we receive word from a stranger that Joebob, a <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> The Sentinent</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> member, is deliberately training and kill-stealing in Lower Guk, and after thorough investigation, these accusations prove to be true, Joebob will most likely removed from <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> The Sentinent</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->. <br>

<!--EZCODE CENTER START--><center> <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>General EverQuest Guide</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--></center><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Guide to Getting Help</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Everquest is a hard game, deliberately so, and so it's not uncommon to want help. To mention just a few kinds: Rescue (saving someone from a train, say), Corpse Recovery (corpse locates, summons, drags, and rezzes), buffs, bind, SOW, teleport, being a 'bagman', information, food/drink, plat, items, and help hunting or camping. Getting help is something of an art, and this guide is intended to help you master it.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> First, Understand the Transaction</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Helping someone is basically unequal. The helper goes to some effort and inconvenience to spare the asker some amount (usually larger) of effort and inconvenience -- like having to regain the exp from a death, or hunt more carefully unbuffed. It's not an even bargain. The asker gets the benefits, the helper gets the penalties. <br>
<br>
Sometimes people are in a giving mood, and will help just because they want to. More often, they are taking the inconvenience equation into consideration, too. The key to getting help is doing what you can to balance the equation: reduce the inconvenience and/or increase the payoff.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Reduce the Inconvenience</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
One case is something of an exception: you can't reduce the inconvenience to helpers during a rescue, it's an emergency. Still, you can make it easier for people to help you if you use /y (which tells nearby people the direction you're yelling for help from), and do it before you're almost dead, because it will take them some time to locate you (especially if you're running) and to decide how they can help you without ending up dead too. Now, on to reducing inconvenience in more common kinds of help.<br>
<br>
The difficulty is you don't really know how inconvenient a request is-- it depends on what's going on with them. Their character may be standing there doing nothing obvious, but they may be in a serious conversation by /tell, dinner's burning, and their baby's crying at home. You just don't know. <br>
<br>
Here's a thought: Look for someone who's offering what you want. You know they're not busy. <br>
<br>
If no one's offering the help you need, ask, politely, over /ooc. Most people will see that, and it doesn't annoy like /shouting does. Don't repeat more than once every 5-10 minutes. Be patient, one part of inconvenience is the timing. By being patient, you leave the timing to them. If you decide to ask someone, don't make that your first communication, say hello first in some way. Their response will give you some idea of whether they're busy.<br>
<br>
Make the location convenient. Don't ask someone to travel across a zone to help you, if it can be avoided. Offer to go to them. Put some effort in yourself; people are more likely to help you if you don't make them do all the work.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Increase the Payoff</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Express your gratitude. Remember, they didn't have to do this. Offer payment, if you can. Frequently, the offer itself is enough. If you don't have plat to spare, offer something in trade -- buffs, foraged food, something baked or brewed. Ask them if there's anything you can do for them; maybe they need batwings or information. If someone goes way beyond the bounds to help you, thank them in public, over /ooc or /shout. <br>
<br>
Be polite, respectful of their time, appreciative if they do it, and understanding if they don't. Do not press people if they refuse. Don't try to bully or guilt-trip people, and don't try to con them by making a situation seem worse than it is. Actions like these get talked about, and soon there will be very few people willing to help you.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Always Have a Plan B</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
There will be times when no one will help. Decide what you will do if you must deal with the situation by yourself (walk where you need to go, pull much more carefully, log off for tonight and try again tomorrow, put off camping that item). If help isn't available, deal with it, don't take it out on others.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Do Special Abilities Obligate Someone to Aid Others Anywhere, Anytime?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
No, they don't. To take a RL example, just because I know something about troubleshooting computers, that doesn't mean that I can't charge for my expert knowledge, and put limits on who can call on me for what, when and how often.. Just because people can teleport, or do a Rez, that does not mean they are obligated to do so for you. They are free to refuse without reason, or set any terms they like for the service. If the terms are unacceptable, ask someone else, or deal with your situation without it.  <p><IMG SRC="http://firebeetle.homeip.net/mustelasig.jpg" BORDER="0" WIDTH="216" HEIGHT="212"><br><b>Gnome Heretic of the 54th Bone Chip</b><br>Lanys T'Vyl<br>Proud Officer of <a href="http://www.thesentinent.com">The Sentinent</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub30.ezboard.com/uhaldorrodlah.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Haldor Rodlah</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 79<br> <font color=#333333>(3/16/01 4:04:50 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub30.ezboard.com/fthesentinentfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=251.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_question_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Guild guide, of sorts</span><hr size=1> Question....<br>
<br>
If I'm camping Dwarves in Butcherblock and someone asks me in /tell to TP them without any offer of money or trade ,can I: 1) refuse them for fear of losing my camp, 2)request some sort of compensation, or 3)feel obligated to because of the ability.<br>
<br>
This does not mean for guildies. I have no problem TPing guildies when I can and have left camps to do so, but for someone outside the guild. If I refuse someone from another guild a TP and it gets reported to our OC will I be held responsible? <br>
<br>
Normally I will TP someone for a donation and many times for free. I am not all that hard up for cash that I need to charge for either my time or my mana. I was just wondering where our OC stands on some situations.<br>
<br>
Another question...<br>
<br>
This came up during my long camp in L Guk for my Gatorskin Leggings. The Ancient Croc and his PH are a 16 min spawn. I camped the AC for about 8 hours when someone asked to join me and my partner. We had the camp easily and was loath to roll for an item I had camped for so long. I understand the PNR and have talked to a GM about it, but what is the guild rule on this subject? If the person in question had envoked the PNR I would have complied, but not happily. It was a situation that could have turned ugly, and I'm kind of curios if the OC would have supported me if it had. I handled the situation with diplomacy and in /tell chat so that it was private and not disturbing others playing time.<br>
<br>
<br>
I think that's all for now...hehe. <br>

It's ridiculous.  You're in no way entitled to help someone out, whether it be through ports or whatever else, whether it be in the guild or no guild.  If you say &quot;No,&quot; someone has to respect that.  I'd say you can make the choice in this situation.  You're free to ask for compensation, and you're free to deny their request, but please don't feel obligated to port someone just because you can.<br>

About having PnP invoked on you... ugh.  I hate people who do that.  I think that happened to Tygard a while back while he was camping the Arena aviak spawn.  He was doing the spawns solo, and some guy waltzed right on in and started taking the spawns.  A GM was finally called in, and instructed them to either share the spawn, or one of them was going to have to move.  PnP can be abused so easily this way.  Hell, if I wanted to, I could barge in on a group in LGuk who's camping the Frenzied Ghoul (he drops the FBSS), and demand that they share the camp with me.  After all, PnP says that you have to share if a dispute is brought up, right?  If I see someone camping something, though, I respect their camp, and wait until they leave if I want the camp.  I wish others felt this way, but they don't.<br>
<br>
I agree with the PnP in regards to no KS'ing, no ninja-looting, etc., but this camp-sharing stuff really irritates me.  In that respect, I don't know what would've happened if your situation would've turned ugly.  Maybe, if you would've denied the guy's request to group, he would've just left you alone.  Or maybe he would've gotten whiney and called in a GM.  This is only my opinion, and I don't speak for the entire OC in saying this, but I can't override a GM.  If they say &quot;You <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> have</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> to share!&quot; what can we do?  I just hate people who try to force you to share a camp just because of some rule originally made to keep level 60's from farming Guk all day long.   <p><IMG SRC="http://firebeetle.homeip.net/mustelasig.jpg" BORDER="0" WIDTH="216" HEIGHT="212"><br><b>Gnome Heretic of the 54th Bone Chip</b><br>Lanys T'Vyl<br>Proud Officer of <a href="http://www.thesentinent.com">The Sentinent</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub30.ezboard.com/ubrambler.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Brambler</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://eqbrambler.homestead.com/files/3dlgowu2.jpg BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Sentinent Member</span><br>  Posts: 162<br> <font color=#333333>(3/16/01 5:59:41 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub30.ezboard.com/fthesentinentfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=251.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://eqbrambler.homestead.com/files/leaf.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Guild guide, of sorts</span><hr size=1> I'm curious as to the pnp stuff as well.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>
This one should be obvious, but just in case some may not be aware, we are not a guild who advocates the breaking of the Play Nice Policy (PnP). (The PnP guildlines are located here.) If any person is found to be breaking the rules of the PnP, be forewarned that it may mean your permanent expulsion from The Sentinent.<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
A big part of the PnP rules is the bit about how a spawn can't be &quot;owned&quot; by someone and if another player wants to bust in on your camp and demand a shot at whatever it is that youre campin, they are within the official rules and they must be allowed a chance at it.  I for one think this is one of the most foolish rules laid out by Verant and does nothing more then promote a lazy and dishonest style of play (camp stealing via pnp or waiting as someone breaks a difficult camp then running in and demanding they share with you, etc etc).  Based on the fact that this is the policy that is most commonly associated with PnP, it would seem appropriate to maybe edit that part of the guide to specifically forbid intentional training, KSing, ninja looting rather then require strict adherence to PnP.  I certainly dont think any of us supports calling in GMs to enforce PnP for camping purposes and I also doubt any of us wouldnt have a good bit of animosity towards anyone who did it to us.  So in essence, as it stands now, I would be breaking guild rules if I camp a rare spawn and then, once the rare pops, I refuse to give some random schmoe whos just walkin by a shot at killin it since he did nothing to break or hold the camp?  Afterall I would be violating pnp..  anyways, just think it might give the wrong idea with its current wording...<br>
<br>
As for the port stuff, you should never ever feel obligated to do a port for someone outta the blue.  Doesnt matter whether they offer you money or not, you arent a public taxi and you and you can always refuse... Especially if you are camping a spot which could easily be lost if you leave.  In these situations I always reply to requests for ports with something like: &quot;Sorry, busy&quot; or &quot;Sorry, hunting&quot;  I've never had a problem with people not taking no for an answer and hope i never do <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .   The other obvious time in which I'll never leave to do a port (unless its an absolute emergency for a guildie or a friend) is when I'm grouped.  Also, /role is your friend, it can come in handy when you are busy and getting alot of port requests (happens alot in Velious since its so far from the mainland), one days like that I usually find turning it on eliminates all requests. <p><IMG SRC="http://eqbrambler.homestead.com/files/sig1.jpg"> <BR>

First question...Dont feel for any reason that you are ever required to give up your playing time for teleports to anyone, guild or nonguild. Its all your decision, and as long as you were tactful and pleasant about it, the OC and the entire guild would stand behind your decision. If you choose to ask for a 1k donation, by all means do (they would tell you to stop smoking that crack thou....)See the last part of Musty's post. You are not a taxi, you are a dr00id; so if in that situation or a similar, you are under no obligation to break away from your activities to assist someone else, guildie or nonguildy for that matter. <br>
<br>
As far as your second situation is concerned, alot of grey area there. It all depends on how that other person plays or the attitude he displays. I, personally, have been in that situation (in MM, camping the vampire teeth). I feel that its really weak to invoke the PNR when someone has been camping an item, but due to the fact that PNR's exist, we have to comply. IMO, I would explain to that person what I was camping, and offer to send him/her a tell when I was finished. If he/she wasnt happy with that, I would go ahead and share the camp (reluctlantly) with that person, and ask that I recieve the item up front before it dropped. And if that person still wasnt happy, Id agree on a roll. I understand that just rolling over for someone is rough, but the PNR rules seem to favor those that dont respect others camps, and Ive never won one of those 'I was here first' arguements with a GM...As far as the guild is concerned, diplomacy and courtsy is key, and as long as those are applied to the situation you cant loose and the guild will stand behind you 100%.

Twinking is another issue. I did it, but I only have one alt and will keep to only having one. Should I decide to give up my SK I would give up all stuff on him and trade for new items should i want a new alternate. That way you don't sit with a bunch of alts that never are played.<br>
<br>
About giving away items, helping guldies. I myself feel I can give up many hours to camp something for a friend. However should I see this person sell this item shortly after, chances are that person or any of his/her alts will never again recieve help from me again. I enjoy giving away items to younger players. Who not yet have the money or the abilities to get these items. Usually they are not that good, but drop in kind of hard dungeons.<br>
<br>
PnP, I never enforce it. Is someone moving in on my camp I force them out if able to. By either keep close to them and kill all their stuff, or just make clean sweeps to show them they have nothing to do there. Only time I leave if it is a team that actually would get xp at the location. But lets say I sit in kurns and waiting for undead jester. A lvl 25 come down and say he also wanna camp the jester. I was there first and had been sitting there for a few hours. Will tell that person to share the camp but instead of giving him spawns I pull entire floors and tank them while pets kill it. Since you dont get xp in kurns after lvl 21 or so and I had the camp first I have no obligation to watch out for that person or let him have any kills. Usually people get tired, but I've never been told by a GM that what I do is wrong.. If its Xaijin who wanna share the camp I usually just train him if possible. *grin*<br>
<br>
Ahh well, if you consider this is wrong. I don't really care, its how i play. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub30.ezboard.com/uqweq.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Qweq</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.travelcounsellors.com/images/yingyanganim.gif BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 42<br> <font color=#333333>(3/18/01 11:45:53 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub30.ezboard.com/fthesentinentfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=251.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.travelcounsellors.com/images/tinymouse.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_thumbsup.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Guild guide, of sorts</span><hr size=1> I think the message is clear.<br>
Play nice with each other, and with others.<br>
Play with honour and integrity.<br>
Treat other players as you yourself would wish to be treated.<br>
Don't covet your neighbours ox. (never understood that one - were all biblical times people animal lovers or something?.)<br>

If someone screws you over, give them 5 seconds to run then beat the crap out of them.<br>
