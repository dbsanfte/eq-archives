If a slanderous remark is said of an offending person in game, and it's read either by that person or someone who knows that person, then that person should realize that he/she has offended someone. Some people do not feel comfortable confronting the people that offend them. This forum alows those people to &quot;vent&quot;, so to speak. It also warns fellow guildmates of possible uncouth dealings with a specific character/person. <br>

It was created so that guild members would have a place to share thier tales. This forum was not created to "initiate" a guild war or anything of the sort. I read over the post and I believe that the intent of the original poster was not to "breed animosity" between the guilds or to whine, but to share his story of woe with fellow guild mates. Its what guild mates do, help each other through the good times and the bad and listen to them.<br>
<br>
As for people being slammed on a public forum, if they deserve it, why not? For instance, say I was camping the FBSS with a group, and when the FBSS finally drops, one of the group members ninjaloots it and logs. I would be upset and I would want to share with my guild mates what happened and tell them to be careful if they group with that person. Its called reputation. A person earns it by their actions. I don't agree that a guild should be slammed because of one person in that guild happened to do something negative. But if a person was dishonest or whatnot, then that person has earned their reputation and deserves to be on a "shitlist". If they feel they were in the right, then they can come onto this board and defend themselves and tell their side of the story. This is not whining, this is helping fellow guild mates by letting them know who or what to watch out for.<br>

Lets take a step back from this a sec.  <br>
<br>
First, if the need to warn exists ( there are some really dishonest and bad players in the game ), then I feel an obligation to protect my family.  Do I care about their guild? Nope, not at all.  Their guild is no reflection on the person behind the character, and that is what specifically concerns me and protecting my members.  Lets try and remember that: one is not a reflection of the whole.<br>
<br>
However, if I feel a certain player is a threat or dangerous, etc, etc, to this guild players I feel an obligation to post that.  Does this happen very often.  Well, look, only once in over a year.  But, there it is.  Galadrid is right, they could come here and defend themselves, but Im sure, judging by thier nature, they really could care less.  If they dont care about their reputation in the game, they wont care about defending it.  In my opionion, THAT is who needs a warning note posted on em.  <br>
<br>
But, this isnt a forum to just slam someone because you had a disagreement with them.  Hey, I disagree with some of you.  You may have personality conflicts in the game, ect, etc.  Im talking about SERIOUS evidence of cheating, stealing, lying, ect, ect (such as Galadrid or my example).  This person should be posted in a warn note to the guild.  Additionally, if someone out there hurts one of my players, do you know how likely it is one of us will see them again?  Very probable, and we should therefore have an idea about the individual rather than fall into the same situation that a previous member experienced.<br>
<br>
<br>
So, in short, there is no drama here at all.  This is an understandable situation of type-only communication.  No sweats gang.<br>
<br>
Finally, as it is my sole discretion to call a Guild War I would like the guild to know one thing: even the thought of one is so ridiculous to me as to be a total joke.  This guild will NEVER be engaged in something as meaningless and destructive as a guild war.  We arent wired like that, and its not how we will play.  So any mention of guild war will be taken as a total joke by me.  But, others may not see it that way, so just be a bit careful.<br>

<br>
I think Del has a good point here, and I'm of two minds about it.  We don't want to be thought of as trashing other guilds, that's not productive.  And there's a difference between speaking in guild chat and posting: chat is ephemeral, it goes away.  Posts (technology permitting) are forever, and don't come with the context -- even well-written ones.  Some of you may remember my run-in with an extremely rude group in High Pass.  I was about as mad as I get with them, but now (several months later) it's not such a big deal.  I would even probably group with one of them now, although I'd keep a REAL close eye on them <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .  If I had posted about it, I would probably have removed the post after a few weeks, in case they stumbled across it and it revived the conflict.  I'm just not interested in feuding with people, even nasty ones. <br>
<br>
The point I'm trying to make is that it's more serious to post a written vent about something than to vent in guild chat.  Writing tends to have a bigger effect, and last longer.  On the other hand, Ghardson and Galadrid are right, we should warn our people.  It'd be a shame for two of us to get screwed by the same person.  And some situations are so complex, you HAVE to post.   <br>
<br>
When I was pissed at those people, it really helped to hear Jumil yell &quot;GUILD WAR,&quot; even if they were all from different guilds.  With us, it's an expression of support, but it's capable of misinterpretation if it's written down.<br>
<br>
Basically, I agree with Mord on this issue.  I think we should probably refrain from trashing guilds, because they all have good and bad people.  Venting about someone is maybe best in guild chat, but sometimes a post IS called for.  And maybe old venting posts should be deleted after a while, so they don't lie around like landmines waiting to go off.  Whoever moderates this forum could do that.<br>
<br>
Good discussion.  Well done, all<br>

I believe the best implementation of it is on the Lanys.com website (if you think some of the stuff in our forum was harsh, wait til you read this <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :eek --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/eek.gif ALT=":eek"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  . And its directed towards the entire server). I believe having such lists be public is actually better because it allows the Shitlistee (is that a word? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ) to, if they wish, come share their side of the story or attempt to defend their actions, thereby preventing someone from say making up something to try and damage someone they don't like's reputation (not that I think anyone here would do it but I have seen it happen on the Lanys.com one).  And speaking of the Lanys.com shitlist (and all their forums), it really is a great site and I would definately reccomend checking it out regularly, particularly the shitlist. I find some of the discussions there intriguing and it can really help you avoid ugly situations by knowing who the shaders on our server are so they can be avoided.<br>

n., pl. fo·rums, also fo·ra (fôr, fr). <br>
<br>
1 The public square or marketplace of an ancient Roman city that was the assembly place for judicial activity and public business. <br>
a public meeting place for open discussion. <br>
2 medium of open discussion or voicing of ideas, such s   a newspaper or a radio or television program. <br>
2 public meeting or presentation involving a discussion usually among experts and often including audience participation. <br>
3 court of law; a tribunal. <br>
<br>
<br>
I realize Webster is a bit outdated but still.. other than 3, (and 3 can be debated), a Forum is by nature a Public place. Our postings here should be viewed and made for what they are.. a means of opnely discussing those things that go beyond the boundaries of what we can in game. Those things any of us desire to add.. that matter to us.. in one way or another. Face it, we can't have weekend picknics or set around the table and just talk.. so we do it here.. and should do so freely.<br>
<br>
Some posts will appear important.. others appear trivial.. some enlightening.. others disenchanting. But for any of them to matter.. they must &quot;all&quot; be considered with the same level of individual consideration and respect. Ones views may not be the same.. anothers opinion may differ.. but they all hold weight.. as we all do. I've read each post in this thread and see merit in each persons position and feelings, it's who we are, as individuals and collectively.<br>
<br>
As Sentry has pointed out.. and most of us have probably been on one end of or the other.. written words can leave an endelable mark or sometimes be misconstrued. One cannot see the &quot;inflection&quot; or &quot;Emote&quot; in type that you can in an interactive conversation. Is the same with Email, SnailMail and the like. <br>
<br>
So, will me make mistakes.. reconsider our words? Sure.. it has and will continue to happen. Is it an offense to do so.. something to be afraid of? I think not. If we censor our thoughts, or in this case our words, for the sake of not making a mistake we loose touch with who we are.. again.. individually and collectively. We should simply rely on our own instincts and trust ourselves and each other.. only then can we be truly open and honest here.<br>
<br>
With regards to this Forum specifically - Beware. Could non Sentinent members read into a post what they wanted.. sure.. but as a whole.. what would they see? Could an intitial &quot;flame&quot; incite a readers temper? Definetly. But what about when they came back, or pointed their &quot;buddies&quot; here? <br>
<br>
They'd see the entire thread, and perhaps the entire board.. showing what/who we really are.. real people.. dealing with real issues.. in a fair and open manner.. individually and collectively as &quot;The Sentinent&quot;.<br>
<br>
