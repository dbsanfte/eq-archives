You did an awesome job and brought up a few points that I had not thought of before. I did not think any of it was &quot;uppitty&quot;, each class serves a purpose and all have pros and cons. I would like to add one thing that bothers me when dealing with enchanters and the main assist that I did not see mentioned. Oh course stop me if i missed it. First thing that should be done when a group is formed is decided who is going to perform what job. If there are two tanking classes determine who will be the main assist. Make sure all people in the group know who the main assist is. My pet peev is a a two parter. one part being mentioned that make sure ALL are beating on the same one, but this is where my second part comes in. I've been in many a group where the puller brings one in and beats on it for a min then changes the target without saying anything. If i have already hit my assist button I am fighting a creature that the main assist is not on anymore. I have come to realize that this is a common thing and will reassist a few times during a fight just to be sure. I completely understand that sometimes when you pull a larger monster might want to join the party, but I think it's important for the main assist to set up a button if he needs to change the target. That way the enchanter knows but also the people who were assisting the first target know to change over or hit their assist button once more. Is this a problem that you face on a regular basis or am i just in one of those groups...<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  . Anyways now that i've put in my two cents......I want to congrat tey on a job well done. kudos to you! <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub30.ezboard.com/bthesentinent.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=airrannalee>Airranna Lee</A> at: 4/17/01 1:59:35 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub30.ezboard.com/bthesentinent.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=teynorsax>Teynor Sax</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Sentinent Officer</span><br>  Posts: 92<br> <font color=#333333>(4/17/01 6:05:49 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: comments on teynors piece of enchanting 101</span><hr size=1> Thanks Airranna, glad you liked it.  :-)<br>
<br>
In response to your comments (this is kinda' long), yes this does happen a lot.  Pullers and peelers often switch targets and don't let the group know, which can cause a lot of trouble.<br>
<br>
 A lot of times a puller will see something bigger than his original target add in on the way to the group, and decide to nail that instead.  When they don't announce this, the enchanter can end up mezzing the new target, thinking it's just another add.  Problem with this is, the puller usually hasn't had a chance to build up much aggro this early in the fight, and when the next blow lands and wakes the critter that was just mezzed, it will often charge the 'chanter.  Not only does this cost mana that the healer has to waste on the enchanter, but it's more time that the original target is still awake and pounding on stuff.<br>
<br>
Another problem is the speed with which adds get to the group.  When you have a Druid or Ranger pulling for instance, they often pull with snare.  While this helps the fight, it means that adds will actually reach the group before the original pull does.  Most people instictively start beating on the stuff that gets to them, no-one likes to stand there and get nailed without fighting back.  This means that the enchanter can't mez that stuff because it's just being woken up (refer to the part about smooshed 'chanters above..heh), then when the original pull gets there, people are on the wrong stuff.  And then of course...everyone realizes this and switches to the original target..usually just as the enchanter mezzes it to try to get SOME semblance of control over the pull.  <sigh><br>
<br>
The biggest thing I can say for pullers, and groupies, is to stick to the original target!  Except for a very few instances, the few seconds it takes the 'chanter to get stuff under control is not going to mean the difference between life and death for the group, and if it does, you probably shouldn't have been there anyway.  The ONLY time ANYONE should switch targets is when the enchanter says so, otherwise you beat on the called target until dead.  :-)<br>
<br>
Stick to your target, let the 'chanter do his job, and your life will be a whole lot easier.  Nothin better than killing one target and having 3 more lined up and waiting peacefully for ya.<br>

<br>
1. When tanking, I should randomly change my target throughout the fight.<br>
2. Never taunt anything that is mezzed...just starting bashing it.<br>
3. Always change targets when a bigger add comes into the fight.<br>
Thanks for the info. Looking forward to grouping with you soon.<br>

<br>
The way I usually do it (requires a healer that's watchin out for ya...all hail Taansey, my hero!), is hit Escape, run up to the clump of critters, and do an AE stun.  If everyone is /assist'ing, the ones not being engaged will turn and pound on you.  The first one that hits you will pop up in your target box, and you can mez knowing that he's not the one your group is beating on.  <br>
<br>
This is only really feasible with 1 or 2 adds though, as you don't want TOO much beating on you.  The old-timers in the guild like to crack on my "tanking" skills, but seriously, of all the classes, enchanters are probably the best equipped to get something off of themselves, so you'll be ok.  Cross your fingers, toss off the stun, and go to town!  (NOTE:  ALWAYS have 2 stuns memmed when dungeon-hopping...that way when the adds turn to pound on you, you can toss off another stun without waiting for the 6 second recast time)<br>
<br>
Another (less painful) way is simply to use external views.  If your video card can handle the spam (mine usually can't...sigh), the overhead views are awesome.  Not only can you usually distinguish critters in a clump like that, but if you can't it's very easy to swivel the camera and pick them off without having to move yourself.<br>
<br>
Also, it might help to tell your groupies that you're having problems targetting on big pulls.  Make a hotkey that you can toss off every time you mez something, and ask your main assist to take 2 steps back every time he sees it.  Kinda' goofy, but it works.  :-)  Just let the tank know that he can jump back in after a few secs if the critter doesn't follow him.<br>
<br>
Finally, if the pulls are pretty small but clumped close together, don't try to single one out to Mez, just use Mesmerization.  A lot of 'chanters don't like the AE Mezzes, and I didn't use to, but I've kinda' rediscovered them lately.  The level 16 one only holds for 24 seconds, but it's pretty cheap to cast.  Also, don't worry if you knock yourself out, keep hitting the AE mez hotkey, you'll always wake up a few seconds before the critters do, and can recast in time.  If something resists, odds are it'll come for you, and you don't have the clump problem anymore.  :-)  Just get it out fast before the others wake up and do the same.<br>
<br>
Hope all this helps, I love talkin shop.  ;-)<br>
