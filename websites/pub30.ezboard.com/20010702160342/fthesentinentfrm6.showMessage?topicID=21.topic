<br>
The Guild Guide was discussed -- we're not happy with the camping provisions in Verant's PnP rules, but we go along.<br>
<br>
New rules for the Treasury were announced -- after a month items will be available to alts for a week, then sold, with proceeds going to fund for raid expenses (like cleric spell components).<br>
<br>
A raid was scheduled on the City of Mist for March 31.<br>
<br>
Until next Guild Meeting the Recruiting Officers are Aonedil/Meudir and Ilrissa/Elmarra.  The Events Officers are Galadrid and Sentry.  The Camping Officer position no longer exists.<br>
<br>
Xaijin (was Gajiin) was reinstated as an officer, and Taladan was promoted to officer.  <br>

[Sat Mar 17 17:34:39 2001] Valencia tells the guild, 'Hehe, guess I'll answer that, since I threw that one in there at the last minute...'<br>
[Sat Mar 17 17:35:03 2001] Valencia tells the guild, 'Obviously we don't support KS'ers, ninja-looters, and all that bad stuff, but the &quot;sharing&quot; rule is really shady.'<br>
[Sat Mar 17 17:35:45 2001] Valencia tells the guild, 'I, personally, don't see anything wrong with disputing it if someone tries to steal your camp, but if a GM makes a call, I don't think we have any choice but to follow it.'<br>
[Sat Mar 17 17:36:19 2001] Valencia tells the guild, 'Dunno if the other occifers have any other input on it'<br>
[Sat Mar 17 17:36:22 2001] Baldis tells the guild, 'If we, as a guild, defy a GM in situations like that, we risk getting the guild disbanded.'<br>
[Sat Mar 17 17:36:49 2001] Gaiaspirit tells the guild, 'true, which is why i worded my question the way i did.'<br>

[Sat Mar 17 17:43:22 2001] Galadrid tells the guild, 'the way to withdraw items is to post for something you would like, and the treasurer (teynor) will get back to you'<br>
[Sat Mar 17 17:43:36 2001] Galadrid tells the guild, 'then once you are done with the item, it goes back into the treasury'<br>

[Sat Mar 17 17:44:58 2001] Baldis tells the guild, 'I'm gonna badger Musty into cleaning up the recommendation forum  =)'<br>
[Sat Mar 17 17:45:09 2001] Galadrid tells the guild, 'first of all, if an item has NOT been claimed within a months time, Teynor will make a post saying basically &quot;ok this item will be put up for sale at the end of the week&quot;'<br>

[Sat Mar 17 17:47:14 2001] Gaiaspirit tells the guild, 'refuse to comment on two because i have too many alts.'<br>
[Sat Mar 17 17:47:23 2001] Germish tells the guild, 'Maybe the item should go back to the person who gave it up for the guild'<br>
[Sat Mar 17 17:47:35 2001] Germish tells the guild, 'Maybe that person should have the option'<br>
[Sat Mar 17 17:48:08 2001] Galadrid tells the guild, 'we thought of that, but a person is in no way obligated to put an item into the treasury, once they have, they have done it konwing that they will not be getting the item back'<br>
[Sat Mar 17 17:48:24 2001] Tygard tells the guild, 'i agree'<br>
[Sat Mar 17 17:49:05 2001] Gaiaspirit tells the guild, 'um... i assume alts that get an item from the treasury this way still have to return it when they are done with it?'<br>
[Sat Mar 17 17:49:23 2001] Galadrid tells the guild, 'if the item can stay within guild, then great, but if no one wants it, then it may as well fund the raids... raids can be extremly expensive.... for taansey to cast *1* symbol, it costs her 11pp'<br>
[Sat Mar 17 17:49:53 2001] Gaiaspirit is familiar with that... feature of clerics.<br>
[Sat Mar 17 17:50:13 2001] Xaijin cant wait till he starts asking for coffins....<br>
[Sat Mar 17 17:50:21 2001] Galadrid tells the guild, 'alts will still have to return items, yes'<br>
[Sat Mar 17 17:50:27 2001] Gaiaspirit tells the guild, 'good'<br>
[Sat Mar 17 17:50:28 2001] Baldis tells the guild, 'Likewise, the proceeds could be used for coffins if we ever need to summon lost corpses from lava or whatnot'<br>
[Sat Mar 17 17:50:47 2001] Gaiaspirit tells the guild, 'no more lavadiving for Ana?'<br>
[Sat Mar 17 17:50:58 2001] Xaijin tells the guild, 'thats my fav swimmin hole'<br>
[Sat Mar 17 17:51:05 2001] Galadrid tells the guild, 'lets face it guys... there's a lot of duplicate stuff in the treasury, and its just rotting there... why not sell it off and help the guild at the same time?'<br>
[Sat Mar 17 17:51:14 2001] Xaijin tells the guild, 'I agree'<br>
[Sat Mar 17 17:51:17 2001] Gaiaspirit tells the guild, 'sounds good to me.'<br>
