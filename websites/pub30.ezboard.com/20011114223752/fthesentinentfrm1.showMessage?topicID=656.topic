Daniells guild was in the zone to help him on his epic, having all the pieces done he was only in need of turning it in. upon arriving the NPC that they were supposed to meet KOS'd the raid party, for reasons unkown. the npc is supposed to be &quot;indifferent&quot; since the zone has no faction other than its inhabitants. because of the KOS, the party was forced to react and in end slayed the NPC. at this point the whole party went KOS to everything and was wiped out. clerics that maganed to camp out and log back in to preform rezzes were slaughtered along with the people they had just rezzed. a few people, my boyfriend being one, died several times. after many long petitions and countless hours ( or so it seemed) the GM's finally responded to the Plane of Air to pull the corpses and preform customer rezzes. as players entered the zone they noticed they were still kos to everything. when they confronted the GM's on this matter they were told it was their fault for hitting the mob back and that the faction hits they took will stick with them forever. this in end resulted in NO epics for anyone who, attending that raid.. needed an NPC in that zone. many were outragged and a few of my dear friends left the game because of this. the GM's offered no help to right the faction and everyone was turned away...<br>
<br>
here comes the bad part.. well for me atleast. my boyfriend, having all his pieces there with him was one to recieve the faction hit, ruining all his chances to ever become an epic paladin. i personally was rather appauled that the GM's simply turned everyone away stating they had &quot;screwed themselves&quot; over and nothing would be done. it saddens me that because of this something someone worked so hard for will never get one of the things he desires most. after talking with his guild it was decided there truely was nothing that could be done, and he chose to leave the server and start on the new RP one, Fironia Vie. i, one for the love of my boyfriend and the love of new adventure have chosen to also move to this new server. i truely wish i could take you all with me but i dont think i could haul all of my beloved guild along lol. i shall be keeping nolinae in this server so that i can come back and visit you all as much as possible. it sucks thinking about my little bard, one blue from 41.. and a blue i dont think i want to get. it hurts alot knowing that ill have to leave this guild but the options at the moment arent very open, and sometimes its just good to start new. im sorry if my return to the guild has been short, but if its ok i would love to keep her guilded while i am gone so i can keep better contact with you all. i love you all so dearly.. my home, my friends.. and i will miss you all so much. i hope you understand my reasons for the decision i made. if anyone ever needs me i will be on the test server for Fironia Vie learning the ropes or on and off my chars on here, giving things away. my char name on the new server will be Amberly if anyone decides to drop in and see the works, would love to say hi =) i hope you all have wonderful evenings and the best of luck in game and in real life. <br>

I for one can say that if something like that happens on mine, I'll be buying some plane tickets to the homes of the GMs. Nuff said.<br>

<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> upon arriving the NPC that they were supposed to meet KOS'd the raid party, for reasons unkown. the npc is supposed to be &quot;indifferent&quot; since the zone has no faction other than its inhabitants.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I'm assuming the NPC you're talking about is Inte Akera in the Plane of Air.  He is the guy Paladin's hand their stuff in to get their Fiery Avenger.<br>
1. He is on Deepwater Knights faction. (Erudite Paladins)<br>
2. He is ALWAYS KoS to any evil classes or those with low standing with the DW Knights.<br>
3. He also has a HUGE aggro range. (and quad hits for 1000+ I'm told.)<br>
<br>
Normally, all evils/KoS are sent as far away on the island from the windmill Inte Akera is spawned in as possible or are not even brought up to that island until the hand-in is done...<br>
<br>
His faction is fixable.  There's a low level necro NPC on a 6 minute timer in Toxx Forest who gives decent faction adjustments.  I'm not sure how badly he damaged his faction, but he can check by /conning one of the Deepwater Knights in Erudin.  After about 2-3 hours you can go from indiff to warmly, so if he's at rock bottom expect this to take much longer.  He MUST be warmly at least to even think of handing in the items.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathfieryavengerknowledgepool.showMessage?topicID=1283.topic">pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladi...1283.topic</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
Did Daniell hand in any of his items?  I would have him check his faction with the DW Knights before you guys quit the game or anything that drastic.<br>
<br>
He should probably look at this link for spoilers or more info on Inte and the FA quest in general...<br>

Noli, pass Del's info on to Daniell, perhaps this is fixable.  Granted, after being mistreated like that by the GMs I'm not sure I'd want it fixed, but it's worth considering.  <br>
<br>

EDIT:  Another alternative would be to die on the first island, have a necro summon him to the fourth island (out of aggro range), have a cleric drag him to the pally NPC and res him.  That assumes that the plane is already somewhat cleared so the res timer doesn't run out, and that you can get a party willing to do so for your pally friend. <p><img src="http://home.swbell.net/sdspies/images/kermit1.jpg" BORDER="1" WIDTH="296" HEIGHT="190"><br><a href="http://pub76.ezboard.com/banarchyonline13012">Anarchy Online Forums</a></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub30.ezboard.com/ucaederedraconis.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Caedere Draconis</A> at: 10/3/01 5:56:36 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub30.ezboard.com/udeladar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Deladar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>(un)Sentinent Board Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 135<br> <font color=#333333>(10/4/01 9:49:12 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_cry.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: this is hard to say.. so please bare with me</span><hr size=1> This is just boggling my mind.

<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> What About Faction Issues?<br>
<br>
Nothing killed in Plane of Sky results in a loss of any faction. You can come back repeatedly and everything that was non-aggro before will still be non-aggro. Some MOBs connected to epic quests give out faction losses, but these are usually faction losses specific to that epic and are not harmful for others to partake in<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

I dunno what to say from here.  Has he tried zoning back in?  Maybe leaving the zone and re-entering might have cleared a &quot;ghost&quot; faction issue.  I suppose he could try zoning in and then running off the edge if aggroed upon entry...<br>
<br>
Caedere's idea would probably work too.  Dying on the first island, then getting corpse summoned/rezzed on Inte's Island island might work assuming only the quest giving NPC's on the first island are KoS to him.  The people getting him there would of course have to be non-KoS as well.  Anyone can spawn Inte so once Daniell's safe and sound on Inte's Island he can be spawned by someone non-KoS, Daniell hands in his stuff and voila, FA.  (We hope)<br>
<br>
I'd be emailing Verant, or posting on the EQ Dev boards.  Who knows, it might be a recently introduced bug?  I dunno, hope it works out.<br>

<br>
 First off Id like to say thanks for all your suggestions. Alot of people have been working hard on solutions to this, but no luck at all.<br>
<br>
 My guild has worked like crazy, looked up stuff on the net and even asked other guilds for any information and so far nothing. <br>
<br>
 Heres the facts from what I experienced. First off I was brand new to that zone, and didn't plan on coming back to it really because im not a huge fan of the planes. So I port in and get assigned to a group. At first I thought it was like plane of fear and plane of hate. I looked around expecting a fight but I saw the mobs all indiffy to me. I was like whoa cool I can run around and not get attacked. But I gues to advance we have to kill some faeri looking things to get some keys to port on to the next island. We we're doing this perfectly for a while, killed about 6 of them and keys we're dropping nicely. Then suddenly a efreti type looking thing poped in the middle of the island and started to nail our rogue first.  By logs that we're kept by a guild mate it shows that the rogue was attacked first, and murdered. Then others followed his fate, after a few seconds the main assist decided to attack. I don't blame him its instinct. You can't stand by and look at a friend die. He quickly started to attack, and called out the assist. Everyone started to attack, including myself. The magus went down after a bit and we all we're quite happy that not much died. In a split second a train of efreti looking things appeared. They went on to kill the whole raid party. I never noticed my faction hit once I popped back at my bind point in Qeynos. I hear over guild that a paladin belt dropped, and they said rez dan and the clerics first. I was extremely happy that a belt for my class dropped and I was being rezzed to loot it. At that time no one knew that our faction had gone to instant KOS. I pop back up at my corpse and my computer loaded a bit as I looked around and BOOM, I was dead. I asked what happend and someone said that we took a faction hit. A while passed after that of rogues dragging our corpses around in diff positions on the isle but nothing worked. It was obvious that we we're dealing with a situation that a GM had to be involved.<br>
<br>
 After all that happend we waited for a GM but no GM was online at that point in time. We we're instructed by a guild officer to create a guild chat room and stay there until further instructions. An hour or so passed and still no GM (not sure about time frame). So one of our guild officers decided to go to the main chat room and talk to the gm and asked to get a GM on lanys because of a situation. A gm was then dispatched after another long period of time.<br>
<br>
 Our bodies we're dragged to the 4th isle and at that point nothing agroed at all. We we're not GM rezed because they said it was not a bug, that what happend was our fault. GM basicly said the faction hit we took was our fault. We decided to attack and now we suffer the consequences. Which means no epic quest, no POA quest and no way at all to get back the POA faction. Now you can imagine how the people took it. Some worse than others of course, when they found out they could never ever do their epic quests. A friend of mine was actually going to get her epic that night. She was going to turn things in that night for her full epic. Guess what happend, no epic! I was also one of those screwed. I was going to hand in my things for my fiery avenger but nope didn't happen that night. The feeling I felt when I was going to get that fiery avenger was undescribable. My girlfriend (nolinae) knows what im talking about. I had become obsessed in getting that epic quest that I made it my number 2 priority in this game. 1 being Amber <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  But seriously I had waited 5 months in level 52. Made god knows how many dragon raids to get those books but all the work paid off. With the support of my friends and Amber I had finally done it. Then my guild quickly helped with the rest of the pieces for my Fiery defender. It was all ready just to hand in stuff and I was going to have my epic in hand. <br>
<br>
 Well after it all happend here is the offical word from the GM about what happend. Basicly someone used an AE mez or stun and agroed people UNDER us. Now this I don't understand when people use an AOE in L guk why don't we agro from under us?<br>
<br>
 When they did the AE it agroed something under us. When person AE it started to kill us. We killed it and took faction. But here is my question on that one. If it agroed casue of the chanter, why did it go after our rogue first and kill him? Wouldn't it go after the AE person first?<br>
<br>
 And last I would say if there is a way to take down faction, there should always be a way to bring it back up. Especialy when an epic is riding on it. <br>
<br>
 I have emailed Verant, talked to GMs and posted on boards. I don't know what else I could possibly do besides going to where ever they live and running over friznik with my ride till he says &quot; ok ok ill give ya ur faction bak&quot;<br>
<br>
 Its seriously not cool about what happend but I don't know what to do. If horizons was out already id quit EQ in a heartbeat. My choice to quit the server is a hastey one but I think I will stick with it. I'm sorry to drag Amber away from the server. I know you people really care about her. Who wouldn't shes so damn loveable. <br>
<br>
 But thanks for all the suggestions. Unfortunatly at this point in time all that will help is getting faction back up. Call of the hero doesn't work in air. I can't even stay alive long enough. All buffs are stripped as soon as you port in. And summon corpse has to have the live person around to target so corpse can be summoned. I can't even stay alive long enough too. The things that KOS upon entry are quest NPCs so they won't be killed. <br>
<br>
 So until there is a cure for my faction hit I don't think I will be returning to Lanys again. So thank you for your suggestions and your concern. I appreciate it all and sorry to say good bye and sorry to take away such a loved person away from your guild. <br>

I think you guys should all get in touch with the guys at <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.slownewsday.net">www.slownewsday.net</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--> (formerly lumthemad.net).  Through their very public and widely viewed rants they have helped resolve alot of problems by spurring Verant to action.  Virtually all the Sleepers Tomb problems were never addressed publicly by Verant until the subject was featured on Lum's site.  More recently they featured a story on a ranger who looted his corpse in the wrong order (his primary hand weapon went into his off hand slot) causing his off hand epic to poof when he looted it because he had no inventory space for it.  Originally he was told it wouldn't be returned, but within a day or so of the story being posted a GM emailed him that they would get in touch to return it.  I think its downright dirty for Verant to be treating costumers this way and if they aint gonna help ya, might as well go as public as possible and sting em.  May just see your faction restored if you can get em to post your story (along with an accompanied rant from one of their writers).<br>
<br>
Best of luck, hope they do the right thing (if nothing else from a PR point of view <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ) and resolve this problem.<br>

You have an eloquent touch about you, you have the logs and I hope the chat log from the GM.<br>
<br>
Its all there. Write it up chronologically as you have done, insert evidence at the right points, be clear, concise and as down on Verant as you can be.<br>
<br>
You'd be amazed at what can happen. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub30.ezboard.com/udaniellholyknight.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Daniell Holyknight</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#333333>(10/16/01 3:21:19 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_cry.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: I agree man - Sting em</span><hr size=1> Sorry about the late notice<br>
