Slowly, he began to withdraw from the clearing, seeking to regain the shelter of the woods, moving as quietly as he could.  Alas, beneath his foot snapped a branch that he had not seen, and the fanged beast closest to him raised its head in alarm.<br>
<br>
Orcs!  Everywhere he turned!  Slashing with rusty weapons, beating with clubs and tree branches!  Knowing he would never reach the safety of the city gates in time, Hyrlue drew his own sword and fought the hoard as best he could.<br>
<br>
Dodging a crushing blow from the orc to his left, the half elf brought his sword down in a vicious slash to the neck of the beast in front of him.  As the orc's body fell to the ground next to it's newly-severed head, Hyrlue dove across it into the open, freeing his back from attacks.  He turned to the remaining attackers and his heart sank.  The minor victory had not daunted the rest of the orcs.  One stopped to snap off a finger from his fallen comrade and pop it into his mouth, while the rest advanced on their half-elven prey.<br>
<br>
The lead orc raised its club high into the air and smashed it down toward Hyrlue.  The warrior dodged the crushing blow, putting himself right in the path of another orc's attack.  He tried to sidestep the attack, but the orc extended his arm and the sword bit into Hyrlue's leg, just above his knee.  He screamed and fell to one knee, his blood splashing onto the loamy earth beneath him.  His sword weakly parried a slash from the largest of the orcs, then whipped across its chest, opening a minor wound.  The wounded orc lept back, more in suprise than pain, but even that small victory was in vain, as a smaller orc jumped into the hole he had created.<br>
<br>
Blows rained down upon his slim body, opening gashes across his torso and arms, as he desperately tried to protect his head.  The strength fled from his body as a final attack landed on his chest, and he fell onto his back, prepared to die.  The smaller orcs stepped back, and the largest, the one Hyrlue had injured approached.  Drool ran across its protruding fangs and down its face as it raised its massive club above its head and bellowed!  Hyrlue closed his eyes and awaited the killing blow, but reopened them when a piercing scream tore the air.<br>
<br>
The half-elf's eyes widened in fear and confusion as the body of the beast in front of him was ripped apart.  Green skin decayed and fell off in seconds, sinewy muscle withered to nothing, and what was left of the orc's body was covered in open sores.  Lifeless, the body fell, pinning Hyrlue to the ground as the remaining orcs turned to face their new attacker.<br>
<br>
Hyrlue strained to roll the immense weight off of him as the sounds of death assaulted his ears.  To his right,  there was a sound like a roaring fire, and a moment later the remains of an orc pawn rained down on the body on top of him.  From out of his field of vision came an evil cackle, and he heard a blade bite into flesh several times, then a heavy thump.  One final scream pierced the air, and the muffled thud of a body hitting the ground was almost drowned out by shouts of fear and running feet, as the remaining orcs fled into the woods.<br>
<br>
With a desperate shove, Hyrlue pushed the body off of him and managed to drag himself up onto his knees.  He gasped as his eyes took in the death around him.  Another orc off to the side was as badly ravaged as the one that Hyrlue had just rolled off of him, and next to it an orc foot lay smoldering in a circle of scorched grass.  Just past that, a dark-colored skeleton was repeatedly plunging a dagger into an already-dead orc corpse.  It cocked its head as though at a voice only it could hear, and ceased its mutilation.<br>
<br>
A low laugh filled the air, and though Hyrlue spun in a circle on his knees, he could not find the source.  The sound grew louder and closer and the half elf again fell to the earth in fear.  Before him, a dark form stepped from the shadows, as though the air itself had parted to reveal him.  The dark skin and slightly pointed ears revealed the newcomer to be one of the scorned, the Tier'Dal.  Hyrlue realized with a shock that he was facing one of the most widely hated and dreaded beings in Norrath, a Necromancer!<br>
<br>
Hyrlue's body began to shake in fear as the Dark Elf slowly advanced on him.  It stopped just a few feet away and stared down at the fallen half elf with blood-red eyes.  For several seconds Hyrlue endured this scrutiny, knowing in his heart that he was about to die, when suddenly the Tier'Dal laughed aloud again and extended his hand to the orcs' would-be meal.  Hyrlue scurried back on his arms several feet, still quaking.  At this the dark-skinned savior laughed again, louder this time, and spoke:<br>
<br>
&quot;Fear not, worshipper of Tunare, ye shall not die this day.  Mighty Innoruuk has blessed me with new power, and I feel merciful.  Rise.&quot;<br>
<br>
Hyrlue tried to do as the Tier'Dal bade him, but though his body possessed the strength, his spirit could not overcome the deep-seated fear of the dreadful being before him.  After several failed attempts, the Dark Elf nodded, almost sadly, as though sensing the cause of Hyrlue's difficulties.<br>
<br>
The Necromancer raised his arm and gestured at Hyrlue.  The half elf groaned, and felt weaker, believing that the dark being was going to destroy him, despite what he had said.  Suddenly though, his body was filled with strength, and he rose to his feet feeling as well as he had before he had stumbled upon the orc camp, perhaps even stronger!  With a sad sigh, the Tier'Dal turned and walked off, his form slowly fading away, until he could no longer be seen.  Behind him, Hyrlue heard the skeletal warrior sink back into the ground from whence it had been summoned, as the half elf tried to form one of the many questions coursing through his mind.<br>
<br>
&quot;Who.....who....&quot;<br>
<br>
A slow laugh echoed through the clearing, and a soft answer was carried on the winds.<br>
<br>
&quot;I am Fear.  I am Power.  Though I do not live, neither can I truly die...&quot;  Hyrlue shivered as the final words washed over the corpses of the slain orcs.  <br>
<br>
&quot;I am Crimsyn, and Death walks in my footsteps.&quot;<br>
