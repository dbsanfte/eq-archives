Being of a curious mind, I was constantly searching for new sources of outside information.  That is how I found the Church, by going there, I would hear of the travels those that were wounded experienced outside the city walls.  I took up helping with the wounded so that I was able to hear more and more, and I soon began learning the ways of the clergy.<br>
<br>
My father, however, had different plans.  His vision for me was that I would marry into one of the higher families, thus improving his position in life.  On my 16th birthday, he made these plans aware to me, and informed me I would have to leave the clergy.  I begged him to reconsider, I showed him the work that I was doing, he was uninterested.  I decided there was only one way that I could escape, I gathered a few posessions, and quickly snuck out of Felwithe, vowing to not return till I had proven to my father that I was needed by the world.<br>
<br>
I had heard of a great Dwarven city in the Butcherblock Mountains.  I needed some armor to protect me and had heard the dwarves to be fine smiths, and so I began traveling to Butcherblock mountains, using a simple map drawn by one of the many adventurers I had helped restore to life and given to me in thanks to guide my path.  Upon arriving, I found the dwarves to be too interested in their Ale to help a high elf, especially one from a noble family.  My heart sank, I did not know what to do, or where to go.  I spent many a night sleeping in the tunnels of Kaladim.  When my disparity was at it's lowest, and I had decided to return in defeat to Felwithe, I happened upon a large Barbarian by the name of Liam.  He took site upon me and felt pity for my situation.  We talked for many hours and I learned of his great skill with a smithing hammer and forge, one of the few outsiders trusted to use the great Dwarven forges.  He quickly crafted a fine set of blue plate armor, asking me to only reimburse his basic costs.  I thanked him, and told him that when my power was stronger, he should call on me so that I may return the favor.<br>
<br>
Having renewed my desire, I went out upon the world.  My adventures led me to all corners of Norath, from slaying the vile undead in the once great mansion of Unrest, to destroying the denisens of Innoruuk.  I grew quickly in my power and understanding of the world, my intense curiosity always by my side, prodding me to paying attention to the smallest details that seemed ignored by others.<br>
<br>
My adventures have been to many in number to detail here, but needless to say I have repayed my debt to Liam.  I may return one day to Felwithe to show my father what I have become, but not today, for today, I shall continue learning of this great land with which we all live. <p>Panili Bluuangel<BR>
