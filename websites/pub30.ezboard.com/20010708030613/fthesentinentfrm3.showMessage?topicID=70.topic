<br>
<strong>Time:</strong> Saturday, April 14, 3-8PM EDT (Noon-5PM Pacific)<br>
<br>
I expect the hunt/raid to last four hours or so, and all the cool loot will be distributed after we exit.  Figure five hours for the entire thing.  We fully expect to start on time and end on time. <br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Level Limit:</strong> 10 to 30<br>
<br>
This event is for levels up to 30 -- aimed at those who could not participate in the CoM raid.  After discussion, it does seem likely that characters lower than level 10 will have a hard time getting experience, hence the change in the lower limit.  I'm not aware of anyone who was coming being below that level.  <em>If you want a character to participate, do not level her or him above 30 between now and the raid date, or you will be excluded.</em>  <br>

<strong>Travel Info</strong><br>
<br>
Najena is in Lavastorm zone(loc neg 1000, neg 1000).  It's hard to miss, two giant doors are off their hinges.  <br>
Lavastorm is north of East Commonlands, past Nektulos Forest.  <br>
<br>
As we learned in the City of Mist raid, travel time is affected not just by distance, but by dangers along the way.  For low-level characters, Lavastorm (and Nektulos, if you're coming that way) have their dangers.  Be wary, and/or go with a group.  If not levitating, don't go too fast in Lavastorm or you'll get hurt falling or take a lava bath.  The DE guards in Nektulos are another danger.<br>
<br>
If arriving by TP to the Lavastorm ring, the safest way to Najena is probably following the wall, North, then East all the way, then South.  If coming through Nektulos (and not a friend of Dark Elves), you'll want invis or camo most likely.  Follow the walls there, too -- west, then north all the way, then east to the LS zone.  If coming from Neriak, follow the left hand wall to Lavastorm.<br>
<br>
Melees can bind (a) in West Freeport or (b) in Neriak, the Dark Elf city in Nektulos Forest.  Neriak is closer but poses risks for most races. <br>
<br>
Ahaz has volunteered to help with transport.  Valencia has agreed to pick up some of our iksar brethren in Field of Bone and TP to Lavastorm one hour before Raid Time.<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Assembly Point</strong><br>
<br>
The large area just inside the doors, but still in Lavastorm zone.<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Group Rosters</strong><br>
<br>
As you can see, these are not full yet, but it should give you an idea who's coming and who's needed (like a Group 1 healer).  I may make changes.  Yep, had an unfortunate drop-out and a talk with Galadrid, so making some changes.<br>
<br>
<UL><br>
<LI><strong>GROUP 1</strong><br>
<LI>Grounded, 16 Warrior<br>
<LI>Kagenotora, 15 Monk<br>
<LI>Kurtanal, 16 Paladin<br>
<LI>Nevir, 16 Rogue (GL)<br>
<LI>Reeky, Shaman<br>
<LI> <br>
<LI><strong>GROUP 2</strong><br>
<LI>Braelelilu, 19 Warrior<br>
<LI>Bedos, 17 Enchanter<br>
<LI>Zummy, 19 Warrior<br>
<LI>Bookert, 20 Ranger (GL)<br>
<LI>Toxen, 15 Shaman<br>

<LI>Xiltin, 29 Mage<br>
<LI>Tygard, 30 Ranger<br>
<LI>Elmarra, 25 Wizard (GL)<br>
<LI>Nolinae, 23 Bard<br>
<LI><br>
</UL><br>
<br>
Still room for a couple more in these groups, healers especially.<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong><BR>Maps</strong><br>
<br>
Everyone should have a map of Najena, in particular Group Leaders.  Here, I've marked up EQatlas's map(www.eqatlas.com/najenamap.html):<br>
<br>
<IMG SRC="http://www.pobox.com/~sentinent/najenahunt.GIF"><br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Battle Plan</strong><br>
<br>
I hope to have 3 (possibly 4) groups, which will enter Najena in stages, so that the high-level groups don't have to kill greens in order to get to their targets, thereby denying low-level groups an opportunity to gain exp.  Group 1 (lowest-level) will enter first, and begin hunting in Area 1.  When Group 1 has cleared the path to Area 2 (or after 10 minutes, whichever happens first), Group 2 (mid-levels) enters and proceeds to Area 2 to hunt.  After the path to Area 3 is clear (or 10 minutes), Group 3 (high-levels) enters and starts to hunt in Area 3.  And so on, if there's a Group 4.  <br>
<br>
During the hunt phase of this event, groups will hunt separately but cooperatively, each in an area that hopefully will provide good hunting.  In addition to hunting their areas, groups are responsible for procuring keys (in Areas 2 and 3) and assisting other groups if called on.<br>
<br>
In addition to tactical command of their groups on the move and in battle, Group Leaders are responsible for negotiating with people who are there in their Area when they get there or come in during the event.  Be polite, explain what we're doing and how long we'll be there, offer them the next key if we already have one, etc.  <br>
<br>
If all the keys fall into our hands, Group 3 (or 4) will kill Najena.  I do not think there is sufficient room around Najena to mount a raid-style multi-group attack, though I'm open to argument.<br>
<br>
After we kill Najena and are getting bored, the Raid Phase will begin.  All groups will cooperate with the goal of killing the Widowmistress.  Just as in a raid, tactical command for all groups will go to the Group Leader of Group 3 (or 4, if there is a Group 4).  All groups will assemble in Area 4 and kill the Widowmistress as often as possible.  This will almost certainly Not be Easy.<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Insertion and Extraction</strong><br>
<br>
Groups will enter Najena on a 10-minute stagger in numerical order (1 being lowest-level), and move to their assigned areas to hunt.  If we never get into Raid Mode, groups will leave in reverse order (highest first).  If in Raid Mode by end time, we go together, with Group 2 on point and Group 3 at the rear (or 3 and 4, if there's a 4). We will reassemble at the large area just inside the doors to distribute loot and celebrate.  It would be nice if TP support were available for those low-levels Far From Home.<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Loot Rules</strong><br>
<br>
Loot will be handled in Raid form.  Each group will have a Master Looter (ML) who loots all corpses.  MLs should announce any cool loot on /ooc, however, no loot (other than No Drop) will be distributed before the raid's end.  (Just make a note of the stuff you'd love to get :)  ) After extraction, group MLs will begin distributing (highest level first).  As usual, Need Before Greed.  MLs will random roll if necessary.  <br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Tactical Tips</strong><br>
<br>
There are plenty of casters, so stuns are nice.  Also plenty of summoned stuff and undead.  Lots of pets and necro/SKs.  The Tentacle Terrors have a knockback attack, so melee with a wall at your back.  Also, the TTs like to run; don't let them.  The Froglok ghouls in the pool like to root you underwater.  Linara will aggro sometimes even though she's a prisoner and she charms effectively.  The Visiting Priestess is a cleric and heals like crazy.  Widowmistress can hit for about 4 x 80 (dual wield/double attack) and poison and backstab.  <br>
<br>

If you intend to come, you may sign up here or on the old thread, I'll keep up with both.  Should be fun, don't miss it.<br>

I still plan on being there tonight, but will be a couple of hours late.  Could you please reserve a spot in group one for me.  Looks like they have 5 members and i would love to be this sixth.  Since they are in the front of the zone, It should not be too hard for me to hook up with them<br>

All my own opinions, of course, and fallible as usual.<br>
<br>
<br>
Matters of Time<br>
<br>
Easter weekend is probably a bad time to set a raid (note to self: look up holidays).  A lot of people had conflicts which made it tough for them to be there or to be there the whole time.  Actually, as far as arriving on time, it was a big improvement over CoM.  Most everyone was there within 20 minutes of start time, which is not perfect, but it's better.  The delay in arrivals did cause changes in the group insertion plan, though.  (Sakkorisu gets a pass from me this time -- anyone willing to walk from Kunark is ok in my book.)<br>
<br>
<br>
Matters of Level<br>
<br>
Because Group 3 was ready before any of the others, it went in first.  This proved to be a blessing in disguise, as they procured Bonecracker's keys from Area 2.  After Groups 1 and 2 got it, it became clear that Group 2, at least, was a little underpowered for its area, and would probably have had trouble getting those keys.  Actually, Groups 1 and 2 were pretty much the same levels, demonstrated by the fact that they merged without problem later in the raid.  <br>
<br>
<br>
Matters of Death<br>
<br>
Group 2 took the first hit, getting wiped out in Trazdon's room by a LARGE group of casters and such.  Group 3 responded to that situation by clearing out the area for us to recover our corpses (thank you).  Later, when Group 1 got wiped out, Group 2 returned the favor.  Both were good examples of group cooperation and coordination.  Group 3, as you may have read in other threads, went to help one Geomoon more than once and got charmed by Linara Parlone, losing some people AND the No Rent key to Drelzna's room.  That effectively put an end to the drive to exterminate Najena.  <br>
<br>
<br>
Matters of Reward<br>
<br>
The raid ended on schedule, although uncompleted.  A Blackened Sapphire, and an assortment of armor and general loot were divvied up afterwards, along with some coin.  Most everyone seems to have gotten some exp as well.  I had fun, and I think many others did too.<br>
