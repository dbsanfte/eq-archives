Just wondering what you guys take on all this is.  Is it as bad as they say?<br>

<br>
The 12.6 patch isn't <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> nearly</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> as bad as people (like Lum) are making it out to be.  The main complainers I've seen are Agents, and as you've read, they're mostly bitching about their Aimed Shot &quot;nerf.&quot;  They knew it was coming.  They had to have.  I'd scan through the official AO boards and see Agents gloating about how they killed a guy in one hit (in PvP), how they were able to solo through missions full of reds (<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> reds</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, for Christ's sake!), even at the higher levels, and they act surprised that they got dealt this hand.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Riiiiiight</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.<br>
<br>
Funcom also buffed mobs so that, when they're not in battle, they'll buff themselves and their buddies.  Also, if a mob is able to, it'll try to heal itself in battle, or heal his buddy if he's close by.  I've heard people complaining about mobs healing eachother through walls, but I've yet to have it happen to me.  /shrug.<br>
<br>
Hm, what else.  Oh, yeah.  They said in the patch that they fixed some sort of exploit that dealt with run speed.  I think that &quot;fix&quot; has created an unnecessary (and very annoying) side effect, though.  Since you've played, Bram, I'm sure you know that if you get into a highly-populated area (like near a whompa terminal or something like that), the game starts to lag out, and you're pretty much frozen in place until the game can load all the details.  Before, if you were running into an area, and this happened, if you let go of the run key, you'd stop.  Now, if you're lagged out, and you let go of the key... you keep running.  And running, and running, until your PC can catch up with all the information being sent.  <br>
<br>
I've also noticed some mobs having extremely large nano pools, but it's only been Adventurer mobs.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :/ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":/"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I was fighting one in a mission, and when I got him down to 25% health, he started healing himself.  And healing, and healing, and healing, and healing, and healing...  I wasted 500 rounds, I shit you not, on him before I finally got two crits in a row on him and finished him off.  Annoying, yes, but that's one of the things they're going to be fixing shortly, if I'm not mistaken.<br>
<br>
Ah, and there's another annoying bug.  If a mob tries to cast a nano on me, and I resist it, it used to say &quot;You have countered the nanoprogram&quot; (or something like that) just once.  Now, you get...<br>
<br>
You have countered the nanoprogram.<br>
You have countered the nanoprogram.<br>
You have countered the nanoprogram.<br>
You have countered the nanoprogram.<br>
You have countered the nanoprogram.<br>

You have countered the nanoprogram.<br>
You have countered the nanoprogram.<br>

<br>
...until the mob has completely finished casting the spell.  <br>
<br>
So, all in all... is the patch a screw-up?  Oh, hell yes.  Is it enough to make me want to quit the game?  Oh, hell no.    <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub30.ezboard.com/uhaldorrodlah.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Haldor Rodlah</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Sentinent Member</span><br>  Posts: 273<br> <font color=#333333>(9/24/01 1:05:18 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub30.ezboard.com/fthesentinentfrm25.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=27.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Status of AO</span><hr size=1> It is tougher. I crashed 7 times last night and during one series of those crashes I left Gajiin and (the character formally know as) Geana in an area full of mobs that conned high to me...and I was 5-7 lvls higher than those 2. When I returned the first time ( after leading them to this difficult place) I found myself quite a ways away from them and incapable of returning to them quick enough to help them with any problems that might arise. Geana eventually ended up dying and Gajiin barely made it out alive. I eventually ended up makeing it to them but was low on life and unbuffed and died first. There was some mobs that attacked us that were either invisible or on the other side of walls. Gajiin's pet was bugged at one point and useless to us. I also noticed an increased aggro from mobs. And I don't mean during combat..I mean when I'm running along and a mob hits me with a melee attack from 300 yrds! Another thing I've noticed since that patch is sometimes when I'm in a city I will stop pressing the arrow key that allows me to run yet I continue to run (even if I run into a wall!...no stoppage) It does seem to be more buggy, and more difficult as well. I don't blame many people for cancelling thier account. I have a lot more patience than to not at least give FunCom a chance to resolve this. I have faith they will because they are already at about 1/2 the accounts they had. It's democracy and capitalism at it's best! <p>Ghardson Megansbane

<br>
  &quot;Mission enemies are not only harder, they are invisible, invulnerable, not there and still attacking, not there and NOT attacking, attacking through walls, buffing with unlimited nano, and even attacking above or below their 'colored' difficulty&quot;<br>
<br>
Maybe i'm just lucky or maybe this is happening is just some zones and not the zones I like to play in.  But I have not run even one invisible or invulnerable mob.  Have not had any attacking through walls at me.  Seen no unlimited nano (now this is iffy tho, because MAs do ALOT of damage very fast so I do more damage then they could heal in the first place so do not see the unlimited nano come into play).  I'm not even sure what he means by  &quot;attacking above or below their 'colored' difficulty&quot;.<br>
<br>
Have not run into the &quot;running&quot; bug musty and ghard, but this may be because I keep all options on min so my computer does not have to load as much.<br>
<br>
One thing I can say tho, AO does have alot more lag after the patch.  I mean ALOT more.<br>
<br>
One other thing, they toke severs down this morning for a sever side patch, hope it help some stuff.<br>

This game is full of them. They whine about ANYTHING and EVERYTHING. The auction channel and team channel are full of them. Now they're pissed cause they cant alpha strike, and they cant exploit like they're used to. Unfortunatly, they make up the majority of the players that read boards atm. It's just like Lanys...see all the people posting? Only a fraction of the actual players there. The fix was nice, cause now I can hit MA style again and most of the patch bugs are gone. But geez, come on .... agent one shot killing? sick, glad it's gone. Mobs buffing and healing? Shoulda always been that way. Oh, and this one Im sick of the most -&gt; why should we pay to be beta testers? I wish those people would just take a hike off a short pier carrying bricks....

<br>
They seem to have fixed the difficulty of mobs, and the can't-attack bug is really rare now.  The lagged-connection bug is still there and still annoying, but just means that I have to be more careful with my running through crowded areas.<br>
