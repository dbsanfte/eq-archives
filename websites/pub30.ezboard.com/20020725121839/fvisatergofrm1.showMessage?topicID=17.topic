Ugh. My Mother had a accident(she is 74) so after some thought I decided to move in with her to take care of her. At first I was just going to come in a few days a week. Then I realized that I was being selfish. I just did not want to move my 3 computers and everything else. I was putting my comfort and EQ above being a good son to a super Mother. <br>
<br>
A few years ago on New Years, not having much, I decided I would be a much better Son, Nephew, Brother and Uncle to my family. So I will be in and out for a while but in a month I should be permanent there with 4 computers and 4 accounts and DSL. Fear LUG Inc. heheh<br>
<br>
I hate leaving my dad(72) alone but there is a Uncle and some good friends of his next door, and I'll be here every Sunday to watch football. And he is in much better shape then my Mom. And my Uncle and he spend so much time together now it will be a week before he knows I'm gone, lol. They are Dart fantics, going to 5 different places at nights depending on when and where &quot;Dart night&quot; is. They have dart cases, and darts for wind, heat, all special shots. It cracks me up, but I'm glad my dad is out and about after 8 years of sitting at home flipping channels.<br>
<br>
So, I know the timing is bad, but please hang with me.<br>
<br>
OK, time to expain LUG Inc. These 24 PC's(soon 32) work together to better us all. Each has a Role. Some are to level to Planes level. Others have reached their level limit.<br>
<br>
The Accounts and the PC's on them.  First must come Runeflinger's(53th Druid), Pobble(42th Cleric), Arbo(30th Cleric), Zakad(23th Monk, now a Banker) Spellholderguy(2nd level Cleric, a Banker, will be worked to 5th(for Gate)), Gottohealeup(2th level Cleric, a Banker, also to be worked to 5th(for Gate)), Tagar(18th Rogue, Errand boy, hangs in EC Tunnel, buys, sells and transfers items) and Viltro(10th Bard, with the new rules, he was meant to stay 9th but accidently hit 10th so we will see) I meant for him to be a Super Scout, checking areas, and who cares if he dies.<br>
<br>
A Banker is not what I call my &quot;Money Man&quot;. Instead, &quot;Bankers&quot; hold 100's of Words, Runes, Pages, etc for spell making, so stop on bye. Also weapons, armor etc to be given away.<br>
<br>
My &quot;Money Man&quot;, holds my main cash. (1p-20ppK) Tends to be Robinwoode or Secretsquirrele. Or it could be any of my &quot;Porters&quot;.<br>
<br>
Porters can not Teleport. You will notice that I have a lot of 15thest Druids and Shamans. The main reason he at thay level they have all the basics, Cures, Heals, SOW's, Gate, small Buffs etc. Except for the one I keep in Gfay and the Shamans leveling at Derv1, they stay with me. For instance, there are several camped near my Mains in DL near KC. They are all binded at the Bank, often next to the Banker. My Mains dump off all cash, words etc, loot items(lore being always a probem). then when they are full, They teleport to the Bank, and change the change into Plat and transfer over the Runes, Words etc and the Loot items. Koolbrezze(highest Cha) sells the loot and buy Dots, food, water etc and they Sow themselves back to WC where they are TPed to DL's.<br>
<br>
The second Account is Gyrax's(31th Druid), the Manster(15th Warrior), Thunderheale(32th Cleric), Xaldibus(25th Wiz, also a Banker and Errand boy, as he can Teleport to Gfay Spires and Gate back), Tunanare(14th Druid, the Gfay one), Snowheal(12th Shaman), Robinwoode(15th Druid) and of course Minimerlin(17th Enchanter, and fits in a Backpack(very handy))<br>
<br>
You will notice 2, 17th Enchanters. That is so they can die several time during a high level raid or camp where they have no business being. And still give brezze. Remember, at LUG Inc, the &quot;Group&quot; comes first.<br>
<br>
Before I list the 3rd Account, try to remember the following changes coming. A 4th Account will be bought. Pobble(42th Cleric) will be switched to it. Arbo(30th Enchanter) will be switch with Minimerlin(17th Enchanter). I have found that as I play Rune more, they get play less. Plus being on Different accounts Rune can port them. And Pobble is a 60% Rezz Cleric.<br>
<br>
OK, the 3rd Account, Longbow's. Longbow(37th Ranger), Hardhit(33th Warrior), Snowrunner(20th Shaman), Secretsquirrele(16th Druid), Hardheale(15th Cleric), Koolbrezze(17th Enchanter), Slamdame(14th Shaman, my only Female PC and the Manster's wife and Snowheal's Mother) and Zapperu(25th Mage) Zap is a special case, I also would like to move him but not sure of cost atm. His main job is Summoning. Summoning 100's and 100's of free, magic arrows for Longbow and Hardhit and anyone in need. Also a lot of bandages. I keep my bind wound maxed. Longbow bandages for more than his heal spell. When healing and time permits, ALL my PC's BANDAGE first then heal, useing mana. To PRACTICE BANDAGEING, ask me for 300, then go to city walls, Gfay ramp, rocks etc and jump off until below 50%, make sure it is a safe area. Zap also Summons food, water, weapons etc. He is so much fun to play he inched up from 20th, lol. Main reason I want him switched is to make it easier to transfer Arrows to Longbow and Hardhit. He a Snowrunner will make &quot;Spirit Pouches&quot; with food, water and bandages for Raids and newbies.<br>
<br>
So, that is it for now. Rune cannot invite the PC's on his Account into TOV, so it might be a little while until you see them on Guildchat. I tend to have a &quot;Base&quot;. Which is now &quot;LUG Valley&quot;. A little towards the ice tunnel from KC. A little passed the zone into Burning Woods, just into the snow. There is a Mountion Giant hut there(not the fort). LUG Valley is behind it. We hunt Giants, and whatever comes by. From time to time we Raid the Main Fort. I love Hunting Patriarchs, a mis-con and very hard to kill. So, if in area, stop by, or if in need, give a call. Runeflinger can take help almost anyone, almost anywhere and bring help.<br>
<br>
Goals are to get Gyrax back up to Longbow's level(they are supposed to be Groupmates) and where he can be a second main Teleporter.<br>
<br>
Longbow and Hardhit are also to reach their 50th's. To be High Level Raid useful.<br>
<br>
Both Thunderheale and Pobble are to level until High Level raid useful and good Rezzers.<br>
<br>
And I would like to level up a Enchanter. I'm additted to Kei, which only a 60th level has, But unreal super for Groups also. Last for hours instead of minutes and POURS mana in.<br>
<br>

They do there name sorta. LOL. Hard part is playing them. I have thing set just so. Also, I DO NOT really play three at a time or even two sometimes. This was confusing in the past so I'll make it clearer. People were upset that I might not be paying attention. I tend to play the Melee or the Puller. I bring them back to the others if possible. With timing and Hot Buttons it is not that hard to do. This spell takes so many seconds long, so during that time you can throw another, and the Tank is on semi-auto.<br>
<br>
Also, when grouped together(and often they are not), I know without speaking what is needed, what I'm doing, etc. Like ESP, LOL. <p>LikeUntoGod.(LUG)<BR>
