So no sow. The clsoest city is Cabilis. The dungeon entrance is located in the Field of Bone--on the far side of the newbie pit as you are coming from Cabilis. The good thing is that non iksar types can bind an the entrance to this dungeon on the Field of Bone side. This is highly advisable sinse CR can be time consuming and complicated if you are in FV or worse another continent.<br>Our expidition traveled the corridors of this place from beginning to end several times over. Tried a few of the camps there to see what would spawn, what the drops would be, and respawn rates. We went to every major camp to gather this data.<br>The respawn rates are on the average 15 to 20 minutes. It is not untypical to have wanderers spoil your camp. So far we hadn't encountered anything that summons or enrages or anything else nasty like that. There are heavy casters in this dungeon. Cleric types that like to nuke you and heal themselves. And Necromancer types that like to cast AOE dots and single target dots. <br>There are a couple of camps that are preferred more than the rest because of quest issues. Monks like the Library camp because of a mob called Failed Crypt Raider--something about the scroll and the note he drops. Yes we killed him and let the loot rot as we were ignorant to it's use. Apparently he is a rare 8 hr spawn. The 60 Grandmaster that followed us in was a bit mift when he found out we killed him. But the Library also has other gems like the Spirit Tome, a 0.0 weight 6 wis 6 int book primary or secondary. It looks like an open book when donned. Some of you may have seen Portayu with an open book recently. That is the Spirit Tome. Also a set of AC7 wis 3 plus other stats shoulders drop from there. These were no drop. But if you are interested in specific stats Portayu can tell you them. Now the second and maybe more sought after camp is Xalgoz himself. Yes we did kill him as well. Three times total if memory serves me correct. He dropped the Blade of Xalgoz a dandy 2 HS--gave that to Krusc. He also drops the Fang of Xalgoz a warrior only piercer--no drop. Now the Fang really isnt a user weapon. It is a quest piece for the key to Charasis. More commonly known as the Howling Stones. My desire is to see all of us get this piece and go to Howling Stones at some point. The other half to this quest is the Jade Chokadai Prod which drops off Chancellor in the Sarnak Fort in Lake of Ill Omen. Hmmm smell another camp/raid for that ). There are numerous other camps there as well. Room 1 holds the Reaver of Xalgoz. He is supposed to drop the Rod of Battle a 19/41 plus stats 2HB. We killed him a few times and all he dropped was a FS Rapier each time. Lisard was awrded these as he seems to have a fetish for them. Room 2 holds the Straithbone Runelord ( spider ). This was a very disappointing camp as we were there for MULTIPLE hours and never saw him. But on the good side exp was flowing like a river. In this room you can be overwhelmed rather quickly. There are 5 spawns in this room and other spiders like to roam up there as well. The Runelord is supposed to drop a Kylong Wardagger--Rng only piercer. Blade of Fiery Lamentation and Dagger of Frost. Room 3 is the Frenzied room. Now this was a neat camp. Remember the Necro casters I talked about--they are in this room. All spiders. But the Frenzied Straithbone did pop for us and he dropped a Mask of the Eight Eyes. Give Portayu a holler for stats. But it seems to be a nice melee mask. Swagtile already had something better so its still in Ports bank. His rare drop is a Crptraiders Knife. We didnt stay long enough in the camp to go for that. There are other places to see here. Area 4 is not a room, rather the outside yard to the Library. Here Spawns a Warder of Xalgoz who drops a Spine Piecer--sounds rough but we didnt see it. Room 5 is the Library itself--already described that. The shoulder piece I told you about earlier that Portayu has is called the Kunzar Mantle. The Library has several named mobs that can spawn there and each one has its own unique set of drops. Spectral Librarian, Tortured Librarian, Guardian of Xalgoz, and Failed Crypt Raider.<br>Room 6 is a hut that spawns a Hungered Ravener. This is another one we never saw. But he drops a Luminary Two Handed Sword and Icy Blade. This room I affectionatly call the Sperm Room. Raveners look like sperm with really big teeth<br>This camp once gotten to is easily held by one group. Its in an area by itself and not alot of wanderers go there.<br>Room 7 is the broken Floor room--thats how you get to the 5 Towers area which is where Xalgoz is. Also the only way to get to zone out. The Xalgoz camp is a blast. Lots of mobs and good exp. Plus always good to drop the owner of the house yer raiden.<br>One final note to this. There are several pit traps in this place and can put you where you dont want to be if you hit the wrong one. But the only way into this place is to purposely drop through two pit traps. So unless you are strong enough to get thru entire zone to exit you need to have a porter with you.<br>I conclude with this. I believe we are as a guild strong enough to own every part of this place. My expedition team had 5 primary members. Taffeta, Portayu, Swagtile, Lisard, and Krusc.<br>Tammers was there to start us off. But we did this whole place repetedly and things did get away from us once but we recovered and honed the pulling skills and everything went smooth as silk thereafter.<br>My next post is going to be a sceduled raid to this place. REGARDLESS of level I would love to see as many VAT there as possible. If you are in yer twenties we will try to find a place for you. If you are in your 50's we will find a place for you. But I just really want to see VAT there in force. But this dungeon is best suited for peeps 35 to 45.<br>Ok I am done ) lol --ya ya so much for a summarized version ). <p>Portayu 41st Meleeing Druid of Vis A Tergo"For whom does the bell toll ?

Pulling the mobs in Keasora can be difficult depending where you are at, even for monks due to the large amount of casters in the zone. Every room you go into has at least 2 mobs in it, and sometimes you can't always see whats in a room till you walk in an aggro them. The Frezied spider room is difficult to break cause there is a hidden wall you pass thru to get to it and 2 casting spiders are waiting on the other side so you cannot see them. There are also 3 other spawns in there that can possibly aggro.<br><br>The Reaver was harder for us to take than Xalgoz believe it or not. The Reaver has a nasty damage shield so cancel magic is essential. He also uses some mid lvl dots which added with the damage shield (if you melee) can kill you rather quickly. If you are lucky, when you get to the room, his PH is up. There are only 3 spawns in the room so if you can break the room with common mobs spawned, when he spawns he wont have time to cast his damage shield. On a side note: Lisard has dibs on all fine steel rapiers he drops for reasons unknown =P<br><br>Xalgoz I thought was pretty easy to kill. Hell just Port, Taff and myself took him the first time. However this area is very difficult to hold due to the large amount of spawns as Helixx has already discribed. Theres a somewhat safe spot to med just outside the church where he spawns, its best to pull all mobs to there till you get Xalgoz by himself. We tried to hold the area from within the church but when the mobs all respawned outside they were almost all healers and would heal the mobs inside the church.<br><br>I had a blast in this zone and most mobs were either light blue or green. I gained 1 1/2 yellow from killing light blues during this recon mission so exp here is going to be grand for anyone under 45.<br><br>Swagtile Mulepunter<br>51 Iksar Deciple of Vis A'Tergo<br>&quot;If I were born human, I wouldn't have been as good looking&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#6A74B4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub30.ezboard.com/ussovgl.showPublicProfile?language=EN>ssovgl</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.villagephotos.com/pubimage.asp?id_=233506" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Executive Officer</span><br>  Posts: 106<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(7/7/02 7:25:58 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub30.ezboard.com/fvisatergofrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=21.topic&index=2>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.villagephotos.com/extern/233136.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Kaesora Field Report</span><hr size=1> Wow Helixx,<br><br>Nicely done and thanks!
