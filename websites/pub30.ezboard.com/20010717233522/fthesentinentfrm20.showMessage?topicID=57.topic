I'll list a few of mine that stand out from the rest.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
It seems that the geniuses at Verant decided to give Dark Elves the advantage when it comes to necromancy, since every non-expansion spell is available at the Neriak vendors.  So, whenever Musty hits a new spell circle, I create a Teir'Dal mule on Caed's account and sit him just outside of the Neriak entrance while I bring Musty to Nektulos.<br>
<br>
During this time, I put the [AFK] tag on the mule, because I'm usually not even watching that monitor, and don't want to offend anyone who tries to chat to a nonresponsive avatar.  This almost always works, but one day, a not-so-bright young one decided to approach my mule.<br>
<br>
&quot;whats your guild mean?&quot;<br>
<br>
I didn't respond, since I figured he was probably talking to someone right inside the entryway.  However, he persisted.<br>
<br>
&quot;what does your guild stand for?&quot;<br>
<br>
I'm chuckling to myself, thinking that he can't possibly believe that AFK is a guild name.<br>
<br>
&quot;can i join your guild?&quot;<br>
<br>
I still don't answer, as I'm mainly concentrating on getting Musty to Nektulos, but I can't help but wait for what the newbie is going to say next.<br>
<br>
&quot;screw u ill remember your rudeness&quot;<br>
<br>
Then, a minute later, in /shout...<br>
<br>
&quot;what does the guild AFK stand for?&quot;<br>
<br>
I'm pretty certain he was laughed out of the zone.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
This encounter happened more recently--only about a week ago, if I remember correctly.  Musty was plopped in the EC tunnel entrance, /auctioning for the leve 39 drop-only spells, and buying bone chips from newbies, some who didn't even ask whether she was interested; they just stuck a stack of bone chips in my trade window.  I wasn't complaining, though.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   It just meant less auctioning for me.  But then the fun begins.<br>
<br>
A bard runs right up in front of me, and invites me into his group.  I do a /who on him, and see that he's only level 5.  I was a little low on hit points from using my Call of Bones spell, so I accepted his invitation, thinking he was going to use his healing song to try to earn a few gold.  Of course, I grow a bit suspicious after he doesn't do anything helpful, and the other person (a level 13 warrior) in the group says &quot;yay!&quot;<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Musty:</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  Um, why did you invite me?<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Bard:</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  your going to help us<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Musty:</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  Help you do what?<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Bard:</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  we died and lost our corps your going to help us find them<br>
<br>
I was about to disband right then and there, because I had already summoned a pretty damned good pet, and planned on slaying any stray griffins that roamed about, but I figured, Eh, why not.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Musty:</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  Where did you die?<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Bard:</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  in a lake<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Warrior:</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  our corpses are in the lake and the pirannas keep killing us<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Musty:</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  Why did you go in the lake in the first place?<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Bard:</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  i dont know<br>
<br>
I'm a little frustrated right now, seeing as how these two don't seem like the sharpest nails in the bunch.  But, I /follow the bard.  When he starts leading me all the way up the side of the south zone wall, I just go to WC on my <br>
own and figure he and the warrior will make it there on their own.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Bard:</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  bear!!  kill it!!!<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Musty:</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  Sorry, I can't.  I'm already in WC.<br>
<br>
The bard died, and the warrior zoned into WC shortly thereafter.  I go to the lake, and tell the warrior that I'm going to drag his corpse out and pull it to the zone line.  He agrees.  Of course, I didn't know he had multiple corpses in the lake.  He eventually came to the lake, and after a few pulls of naked corpses, we found the corpse with all the goodies on it.<br>
<br>
Then, the bard finally makes his way back.  However, he dives right into the water and promptly gets eaten by the pirahnas.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Bard:</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  why didnt u save me????<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Musty:</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  You had about five piranhas on you, and my lifetap can't kill them in one shot.  I would've wasted my mana trying.<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Bard:</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  thats why we brought u with us to kill all the pirannas so i could get my corps u dummy!!!!<br>
<br>
Yes, I was pissed.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Musty:</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  Look, first of all, I wasn't <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>asked</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> if I was willing to come help you.  And just for reference, no, I wasn't willing, but I did so anyway, but it seemed like you genuinely needed help.  Secondly, it's your fault you died that time, because you didn't even alert me as to when you were diving into the water.<br>
<br>
That shut the bard up for a little bit, most likely because half of the words in that little lecture he couldn't even understand.  I guess he was making his way through EC, when all of a sudden...<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Bard:</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  bear!!  help me!!!<br>
<br>
I guess he died again, 'cause he threw a fit, telling me how much I sucked, and logged.  At least the warrior thanked me heartily for finding his corpse.  I don't understand how the bard could've died to the bear, though, seeing as how he could've easily outrun it with Selo's.  &lt;shrugs&gt;  His fault.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Last night I was grouped with a 31 Monk and a 33 Cleric in The Overthere.  Almost as soon as we start pulling stuff I notice the bard seems to be taking an inordinate amount of damage, get hitting hit on almost every attack for nearly full damage on every one (and to add to the problem the monk is constantly pulling stuff thats yellow to low red to me, meaning it must all be red to her, leading me to wonder if she was even conning the stuff first).  The cleric is basically casting heals as fast as he can and I'm nuking as fast as I can to try and kill the stuff quickly and prevent the monk from dying.  Needless to say, both the cleric and I are almost OOM after every fight leading to way too much downtime, I mean hell, if I wanted to med from oom after every kill I might as well be soloing.  <br>
<br>
<br>
So I decide to start pulling thinking maybe if I pull blues the monk wont get shredded so fast, but again, the cleric is practically having a heart attack trying to keep up with things.  I finally comment about it and ask what her armor class is (and this is with the clerics Symbol and Skin Like Steel and that cleric Armor spell), 510 she says.  I couldnt believe it, lvl 31 buffed to the hilt and her AC is lower then my piddley Druid AC?  &quot;How much weight do you have on you?&quot; I ask.  &quot;Uhhh, 35 stones, why?&quot; she says.  I couldnt believe it, she didnt seem to realize the huge effect carrying over that certain weight (can't remember, 13 or 15?) has on a Monk's AC.  I run up and inspect her and she's not too bad off, had a few absurdly heavy items for a monk like Iksar Scaled Gloves that weigh like 4 so I ask her what she's carrying? &quot;Just 4 backpacks&quot; she says.  Now since they weigh 3 each, that right there is almost enough to put her over the limit.  <br>
<br>
Anyways, I thought every monk had learned by lvl 3 or so about the whole weight thing and knew to carry Large Sewing kits or some other lightweight container, I just couldnt believe she had made it all the way to 31 playing that way and I hate to think of all the clerics she's given Ulcers to over that time. <p><IMG SRC="http://www.geocities.com/damienespo/Brambler-1.jpg"</p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub30.ezboard.com/ubrambler.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Brambler</A> at: 1/5/01 2:28:10 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub30.ezboard.com/bthesentinent.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=ilrissa>Ilrissa</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 52<br> <font color=#333333>(1/5/01 11:51:07 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Stupid newbie encounters.</span><hr size=1> Another stupid newbie ancounter. This time Queshu is sitting outside of NQ gate and up wanders this 3rd lvl warrior. <br>
<br>
Warrior: What lvl are you?<br>
Queshu: I am 14<br>
Warrior: Do you have any PP<br>
<br>
I had just leveled so I had cleaned out the bank for new spells<br>
<br>
Queshu: got about a hundred plat on me<br>
Warrior: Can you spare some money I am new<br>
<br>
I am looking at this guy he has got better armor than I have<br>
and he is only lvl 3.<br>
<br>
Well time to toy with him.<br>
<br>
Queshu: Sure but I need you to get a spell for me.<br>
Warrior: What spell?<br>
Queshu: Sicken (low lvl shaman spell wich i already have)<br>
Warrior: Where is it at?<br>
Queshu: In Everfrost<br>
<br>
about this time a wizzie is busting up laughing in tells thought it was hilarious.<br>
<br>
Warrior: Where is it at.<br>
<br>
I proceed to give him directions.<br>
<br>
Warrior: I'll get killed in Blackburrow.<br>
<br>
Obviously he isnt that new. By this time the wizzie is almost peeing herself. When i finished medding he was gone.<br>
<br>
Try this tactic. The worse thing that could happen is you give the newbie a couple of gold and doesnt come back with your spell. Most of the time they will give up.  <br>
