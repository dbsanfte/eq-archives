They mention that members of that guild might be asked to join the Sentinent. My understanding it was because that they were friends of theirs. More friends the merrier I say. The only thing I'm worried about is recruiting from a disbanded Uber guild based on the potential members level or Uberness. This is what some of the big 5 had had problems with. A few of the members were allowed to join the guild because they were of higher lvl but they turned out to be nothing but problems for the guild (not going to mention any names). <br>
<br>
Some guilds state minimum guidelines. These may be based on level or stats. In my opinion this is an error and I would not like to see happen in The sentinent. Nor would I like to see a point system based on weather a person should receive help with quest or dropped loot ect. If a person needs and asks for help they should recieve that help (within reason) and not wait till they accumulated enough points in a chart.<br>
<br>
The guild is now a the point where it can attract potential members of a 50+ lvl. But I don't think that a person of that lvl is any more important than a potential member who is lvl 10 or below. Its not what the person is that is important. But who they are and how they interact with other people in the game.<br>
<br>
Just some of my thoughts. What I want to here is some of yours. Where the guild is going? What should it do in the future? Is the status quo good enought? <p> <img src="http://www.escape.ca/~ericklee/newwolf.jpg" ></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub30.ezboard.com/uanathae.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Anathae</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Sentinent Member</span><br>  Posts: 278<br> <font color=#333333>(6/4/01 1:52:24 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_question_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Talk of a break up.</span><hr size=1> i believe the only level requirement is a minimum level... and that has been waived in specific instances.<br>

<br>
We have a long standing recruitment policy that has helped us to grow, while maintaining a closeknit group of players that hold the same, or at least similar, values and objectives in the game. Always striving to find the people with those qualities that would complement the existing members and goals of The Sentinent. <br>
<br>
I believe &quot;anyone&quot; is welcome .. granted they pass through the process as we all have in the past. <br>
<br>
<br>
Process as of this time is per ... <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.thesentinent.com/recruit_rules.htm">www.thesentinent.com/recruit_rules.htm</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>

Zameek .. I like your feelings on much of what you said and share them overall.<br>
<br>
It's the person that makes it fun .. not how many times they've been (or not been) to Hate or their unbuffed resists.  Helping another should not require we check to make sure they earned it, it should happen naturally and as needed.  Many of our presently planar members came into the fold in their teens .. look at what we'd have missed out on if we took the stance of some of the other guilds.<br>
<br>
Where we going?  Still not sure .. but I'm having a blast getting there! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Under no circumstances will the guild rules be bent or broken to allow anyone in; this includes the 'uber peeps'. Everone is given the same chance to join up, the same considerations, and is under the same lvl of scrutiny (sp?). The members of this guild wont be absorbed by ours; Gal or any of the other officers would just not have that. <br>
  Due to a few of the recient invitees, I feel I owe a few of you an explaination. Questions have been brought to my attention, and it seems that some are under the impression that they were invited due to their lvl or personal preference. However, this is not the case. They grouped with several officers over the course of days or weeks even constantly, and consistantly displayed a 'Sentinent-like' quality. They all recieved more than 3 /nods throu tells, group chat, or even guild chat, and displayed a distinct interest in joining the guild. Unfortunately they have not posted a welcome message yet. I urge the new recruitees to do so; please introduce yourselves to the guild. And the 2 week period is still in effect; they did not bypass that due to their lvl's.<br>
  IMO the recruiting system we have in place works, because we are all pretty much under the same understanding. And what makes or breaks the recruiting process is the officer doing the recruiting, and so far they havent steered us wrong. Of course, we arent perfect, but thats why we have that 2 week trial.<br>

What?  Who?&quot;  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
The short answer?  Let me reassure you, it ain't gonna happen -- we wouldn't stand for it.  That's not to say that we don't hit gray areas once in a while, or have recurrent discussions about what's best for the guild, but one reason I'm proud to be in the Sentinent is that we have never, to my knowledge, treated a person as an interchangeable part who's only purpose is to contribute to someone else's idea of the &quot;greater good.&quot;  In any case, levels don't tell the story: there are wonderful low-level players and hideous high-level ones.  As I've heard most every member say at one time or another, it's the person that counts.<br>
<br>
This guild has achieved its present state of early Uberness by (or maybe despite) sticking to its principles.  I expect it will continue to do so.<br>

Not how high you are or class. <br>
<br>
If those that are leaving are interested in joining our August band then they should have to go through the same recruiting process as we all have.<br>
<br>
I personally feel that those that choose to join the guild because we are getting to be an Uber guild, is the same as those that join the guild looking for a hand out.(ie we join XXX guild because they can do planes raids = we join XXX guild because they got Phat Lewtz in there guild treasury) I like to feel that this guild is comprised of friends (almost a family) that are here to enjoy this game.<br>
<br>
I am all for recruiting some higher level members, but not at the price of sacrificing the values that this guild was originally based upon.<br>

It's like Galadrid is the mommy and Taansey is the other mommy. And everyone else is the stinky brother or sister. I don't really group with anybody much in this guild, but when I do, it's the greatest fun I have in the game. So yeah, it's not wether you're uber or you can go on planar raids that makes us a guild. It's the little complaints about how one person had a bad experience and how we make fun of that person or how someone has a good experience and make fun of that person. Or just making fun of someone for the hell of it (Xaijin and Xiltin are my personal targets). I don't mean to say that the best part about this guild is how we all bag on eachother, but the camaraderie that comes with it. We come together well for a guild. when one needs help, there's always someone there, so we support eachother. I laugh a lot when I see you guys. I don't care if you're level 55 or level 1. If we can find people who can make the rest of us feel like the way I do about you guys, then I say go for it. If ex-members of a dying guild want to join us because of our lewtz or our uber planar butt kickers, then nuts to that. If they want to be a part of the family, I say we welcome them with open arms. Yeah, we rule as a guild, and I'll never stop saying that, but we're better as a family. Let's face it, we the top dawgs of this server!<br>

And I saw Xaijin bathing Xiltin. He's stinky.<br>

<br>
I hate to post this, because it will most likely hurt the feelings of some.  I as a member of this guild, I feel that there is a group of people, mostly the oldest members, that are the only ones that feel this sense of family.  I do not feel it, never really have.  Now that many of this guilds members are much higher in lvl than me (mostly because I dont stick with one character) I almost feel detached from the guild.<br>
<br>
I guess its my fault for not sticking with one character to keep up with my brothers and sisters, but its just not how I play the game.  I have played every class to at least lvl 10 in the year that I have been in this game, and therefore know a lot about each class.  I feel this makes me a better player in groups and such and therfore makes me obtain goals in the game faster.  But the drawback is that I have been playing this game for one year, and my highest character is a lvl 27 monk.<br>
<br>
An example of how I feel that this guild only caters to the higher lvl peeps is this.  Mostly every raid we have is for lvls 30+.  Understandable since almost every member is higher than 30.  But what really makes me the most upset is whenever there is a lower lvl even/raid...no one in the guild shows up.  So people like me who really wants to do stuff with the guild gets left out.  This makes me feel like I am less important than the higher lvl people as was described as an issue earlier.  Almost everyone in this guild has alts that are lower in lvl and could possibly attend a lower lvl raid.  But since said raid does not provide good exp/loot, then most of you don't try to go too far out of the way to attend.  But when a raid on Mistmoore comes up, there are 15 ppl that are dieing to go...I dont think that is fair.<br>
<br>
I guess that I just really need to leave the guild as a whole.  Like I said earlier I dont feel much family.  The only ppl I really ever have contact with in the guild (that make me feel welcomed as a member) are Xaijin, Sentry and Galdrid.  But these contacts are few and far between, and I doubt I will ever, even in another year, reach a lvl where I can group and do events with these said members.<br>
<br>
I hate to post this, but I feel I need to say it.  I have been feeling this way for a long time.<br>

The first time I saw the guild (or even EQ) was watching over Bookert's shoulder, drinking beer and being a nuisance, during the alt raid on Najena a while ago... that's really what got me into EQ in the first place, was seeing the sort of camraderie between the rest of the people in the guild <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
It doesn't matter to me if I'm part of an Uber guild (although I have had offers), because to me, all those guilds are is a group of people who help each other get pHaT LeWtZ... but The Sentinent is more than that... although I'll admit, quite a few times, guild members have helped me with quests and whatnot, but we've always had fun while doing it, even while dying <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
I'm going to give a brief history of this guild, please bear with me. I'll get to the point... eventually =).<br>
<br>
When the Sentinent was first created over a year ago, its main purpose was so that all the members would be able to keep in touch with each other and chat with each other no matter where they were. The founding members were all very good friends and hunted with each other often. Before the Sentinent was created most of us, if not all (can't remember), were all a part of a "big" guild (TSO in case you're wondering). <br>
<br>
At the time TSO wasn't what it is today, it was very disorganized and there wasn't a sense of camaraderie or "self". There were many guild members, but hardly anyone knew each other. We felt as if we were... a "number" so to say. Their beliefs also were not in line with how we felt. <br>
<br>
Example, many guild members expected Teynor to make jewerly for them for free because he was a part of the guild, didn't matter that he never met them. Thats not right, it costs Teynor money to buy the gems and such for the jewerly and he wasn't even getting compensated for the cost of ingredients. Teynor was like level 15 or something and it was his first character. I'm sure you all remember how difficult it is to make money at that time (which is one of the reasons why we get so upset nowadays when guild members seem to be taking advantage of other guild members abilities without proper compensation). <br>
<br>
So, anyhow to make a long story short, we all got together and decided that we would create our own guild (since we had all known each other before we even joined TSO, as a matter of fact, Teynor, Mordwin, Bini (don't think anyone besides Teynor and I remember her though heh), and I had started playing EQ on almost the same day) where we could always be together and not have to worry about outside pressure to do something we didn't want to do. We had decided to create a guild where every person who joined would be a friend of at least one of the members (back then, almost every new person that joined had hunted with everyone in the guild heh) regardless of level, race, class or sex. At the time, the whole purpose of the guild was so that we would have all have a place where we could talk and laugh and cry... together.<br>
<br>
As time went on, the guild started to become larger as most guilds do, and some of us started feeling that we were losing touch with each other (I blame Verant for this, for their lack of foresight. They almost force people to hunt together and make friends, and yet they force us apart if one friend cannot play as much as another and so the level range becomes too high and consequently they can no longer hunt with each other). New members would come in and some older members wouldn't know who they were. That is when we decided to create the recruitment rules.<br>
<br>
At the time, the recruitment rules were great, it would assure that at least 3 members would be friends with the new recruit and so the new member would not feel left out when they joined. If 3 current members knew and liked the new member it almost a guarantee that 90% of the guild also knew and liked the member, since we were a small guild and almost everyone stayed in close contact with each other. It worked for a long time and assured us that we were getting quality people.<br>
<br>
Now, we come to today. Our guild has grown to a size where it can no longer be considered "small" in level range or number of members. The average level of the guild is between 40-50, and the number of members is 60+ and steadily growing. With these numbers it is difficult to get the same sense of "self" that a smaller guild has. Many of our members have alternate characters that tend to group with new people who they might end up liking and recommending for membership. <br>
<br>
The only difference now is that having to get 3 recommendations for a lower level person is difficult and cumbersome because not many of our guild members are of a low level, and not many guild members play their alternate characters all that much. And even when the new member does get 3 recommendations and is invited in, very often the guild member that talked them into joining the guild gets tired of playing their alternate character and decides to go back to thier primary. I'm guilty of that myself (sorry Kage). Where does that leave the new member? In a guild where they cannot even group with half of the members. Then of course add into the equation that not all members level at the same rate and you can begin to understand why we are losing our sense of "self".<br>
<br>
Believe it or not, Senidyen, we (the OC) are fully aware of this problem and are trying to resolve it. This guild was founded on and based on a sense of "Family". It will <u>never</u> be based on "uber levels or uber loot".<br>
<br>
I'm sorry you feel the way you do, Senidyen. I wish I could talk you into staying, but I can't say that I don't understand your reasoning.  I would like you to know that we are working on a way to solve this and I believe we might of found a way. If you do decide to leave, please know that you will be missed.<br>

I felt the same way in my first guild, I was around level 16 when I joined up, and I didn't level fast.  A lot of the raids that were set up were for the older ones.  The younger raids were poorly attended.  And then, when our guild got absorbed by one of those &quot;uber&quot; guilds, I couldn't even join because I was too low level,  and didn't even know anyone in our guild well enough to get them to sneak me in the back door <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
Now, let me explain my side of this.  It has taken me a loooooong time to level up poor Anjulie.  And I try to play her as much as possible, so I can level her up more just so I can go see new places that I've not been big enough to go to before.  I would play my younger characters, but the problem with them is the same problem with Anjulie - finding a group.  I start a lot of alt's that get to maybe level 7 then they're deleted, because if I'm going to go through the hassle of /ooc LFG then I may as well log Anj on and try to get her some exp than mess around in EC or whatever killing orcs for the umpteenth time.  <br>
<br>
I'm very sorry that you feel this way though, I wish it were possible for us all to group more.  If you want to leave, I hope you find another guild that you will be happy with <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   If you don't leave, then you're stuck with us bwahahahahahaha! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub30.ezboard.com/ugermish.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Germish</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Sentinent Member</span><br>  Posts: 102<br> <font color=#333333>(6/5/01 8:18:04 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   More to what the post started as</span><hr size=1> I do feel people get invited into the guild because of what level and class they are.

<br>
Last night I did /who all GUILD and was surprised to find out I had never &quot;seen&quot; half of the guild that was on.  The Sentinent does not have the same feel of the guild I joined in my 20 s.<br>
<br>
Lasty, no one, OC or otherwise had anything to say about what Zameek asked   &quot;Where the guild is going? What should it do in the future? Is the status quo good enought? &quot;    That does not make me feel very good.<br>

Thats what everyone's saying. We dont concentrate on uberness, we dont gear our recruitment process towards high level people, we dont actively seek out a certain type of class to fill a spot. Our recruiting is done completely based on the quality of the person; THAT is everyone's point.<br>
 <br>
On the direction of the guild. In order to have a direction, there must be a goal, or you could even say they are both the same, right? My percieved direction: to continue playing the way we want to, period. If we had a direction of uberness, we would be filling slots. If we had a direction of power (guess its the same), we'd be haveing raids to camp items, pushing people to level, and turn into hunters and gatherers. Sure, I can see why you would question the recient influx of higher lvl invitees; look at the 'current' guild invite process that is in the way of rework atm. 3/nods and an interview, right? Well, most of the guild are in their high 30's and up, so most of the people they group with will be higher lvls. Also throw into this raids and aid we offer other guilds/people. There is more of a chance that higher levels would be noticed and introduced, and recieve the 3 /nods than there is for the lower lvl players. That is why the recruitment process is being revamped.<br>
<br>
So in my opinion, we dont really have a direction. Who needs one, anyway? As we level up, we form raids, we have guild events, etc. We dont really need a goal to be this guild. Just log on, see who's on, what's up, etc.<br>

<br>
Zameek asked me to read this and post my thoughts on it. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    <br>
<br>
Recruiting by 'Uberness' = bad.  This goes from experience from my time in Seven Dreams.  There were a few times where it was decided to invite a few individuals based on their class, level, and raid experience.  (55+ clerics.)  It ended up being a big mistake, as a few existing members had some personal problems with these new members.  Also it seemed that the new members did not feel they were joining a 'family' nor did they care to...they were simply looking for a means to their ends.  It was ugly, and it ended with a few guild removals and hard feelings that I think probably exist to this day.  Still, as one of the 'uber' guilds I think 7D still leans towards recruiting by classes needed and level.  I'm not saying this is wrong...but it all depends on what kind of guild you strive to be,  and if you choose to go that route...be prepared for the consequences.<br>
<br>
Points system for loot..I'm kind of iffy on this subject.  I sort of like it because it encourages people to attend raids.  I have to admit it motivated me to attend more.  But this as well can create some inner strife and I don't think any guild yet has designed a points system that was 100% fair or that all of it's members were happy with.<br>
<br>
Peace, out.<br>

I think the guildchat you hear Germish, is alot more kidding than anything else, but I can see your point as to how some of the feel has changed. I'm glad the recruiting thingy is being addressed, I'm not terribly fond of how its been going.  With the post n nod system, we had a chance to say if we had known someone was a jerk...once Ghard really liked a guy he was grouped with and was telling me about him.  Well, this fella had taken time out of his busy day to swoop down on the Gnoll ledge in HH to ks the named from my group that had been there for like 3 hours waiting on named to pop(PGT used to be a big deal, hehe).  I think posting a name gives us a chance to review stuff and air any greivances.  I've given thought to leaving again, had a couple bad experiences...one guildie didn't know I was who I am on an alt and acted like a jackass, another was just something a bit silly and I hope it was miscommunication or we might have an ebayer in our midst(hehe, I'm sure its the former and not the later <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ).  I know I'd definatley be out the door if we started point systems, I just don't have time for that many raids n stuff.<br>
Anyway, thats about all I can think of now, and I need to get Sakk out of hell again, and closer to his next, hehe. <p><a href="http://jofus73.homestead.com/files/sakki.jpg

He was a mage, not a very good one but one with a positive attitude and fun to group with. I remember I grouped with Zandzack, Valencia, Sentry, Aonedil and maybe a couple more I may have forgotton. I remember asking Zandzack questions about being a mage and comparing notes with him. We all hit it off well and I was accepted easily by these people. I didn't play as Belzar for long. <br>
<br>
I had been playing a barbarian warrior named Caball until lvl 17 when the guild I was in treated me unfairly and I ended up leaving them under bad terms. I was leary of joing a new guild and had done a lot of thinking and research on this little known guild called The Sentinent. After I was accepted into TS I was totally enthralled by the others in the guild. I soon started to become a pain in the ass with my dry humor and incesant questions. I pushed to become an officer early in my tenure as a TS member, I flamed certain people and I even considered leaving to join another guild at one time. One thing I found out through all that is how to endure not only the hardships of EQ but also how to be tactful and polite. I know I offended some people with my actions. I never officially apologized. I got angry with peoples reactions to my offensive actions and quit playing my beloved Ghardson to play the much more self sufficient druid class (Haldor). Playing as Haldor I learned how to be helpful and generous, but I also learned how to politely tell people no. I learned tact. I learned how to group as well. But above all I learned that a guild is not here to cater to ME, it exists to help each other. I have made friends with some of the finest people I have ever had the pleasure of knowing. I have learned to take each moment and run with it whichever way it will go. I have how to be in a family. And most importantly, above all else I have learned that this is only a game. <br>
<br>
My wife and I were talking not too long ago and she was saying how my attitude has changed and become so much more mature over the last 2 years. I attribute that to EQ and TS. All the things that I have learned in this game from a social level I have applied to RL. It has made my family, work and social life so much better. My wife no longer argues with me about me playing EQ all the time, my RL friends are actually supportive of my endevours &quot;in-game&quot; and I realize that, although EQ means a lot to me, the people actually PLAYING EQ mean so much more. <br>
<br>
<br>
I'm not sure how much I have stayed on topic but it certainly felt good to say some of these things to my dear friends and to the newer friends I have met recently.  <p>Ghardson Megansbane

<br>
These are the same opinions you had while you were in the guild.  You brought them up while still a member and the majority of the guild were not interested in your proposed ideas of no alts and level restrictions to encourage uberness.  We as a guild decided that’s not what we were about and certainly not from lack of persistence on your part.  You chose to leave and that’s fine, our guild didn’t suit your needs.  I would bet the paltry armor on my back that very few of The Sentinents today would want to see the changes happen that were vetoed once before.<br>
<br>
Although there has been a bit of excitement lately (I swear the planets are out of alignment), we are the same family we were.  These things will calm down and the discussions will help to improve our strength and character as a guild.<br>
