<br>
As a young female halfling, I didn't quite fit the mold, I was a little bigger, my muscles bulged a little larger, and I certainly wasn't interested in calling the spirits of nature to help me..<br>
<br>
My parents, my friends, my teachers, told me war isn't the way female halflings go, their place is behind the bar, or it is healing your fellow man..<br>
<br>
I didn't buy it, I know from the start I had the power of Rallos Zek flowing through me, it was that point I left my home, an outcast and looking for a new family, one who could understand that even females can feel the need for bringing the pain, and along with that pain, bringing the funk.<br>
<br>
It was on that fateful night I was to meet my first taste of the possible families I might find in Norrath, for I was crossing through the woods of Kithicor, when suddenly an evil beast, composed entirely of bone, and smelling like rotted flesh attacked, having little experience in battle, killing mostly wolves, and bixies, and the like, I'd never encountered such a powerful creature.. <br>
<br>
It was then I heard the yelps of a Barbarian, and it was the first glimpse I'd caught of individuals larger than myself, there was, what I was told later, a High Elf Mage, by the name of Greyfax, and a Barbarian Warrior, by the name of Beowulff, they saved my life, and I was eternally in their debt.. It was after I'd bandaged my wounds, and had a short rest that we got to talking, I found out all about his journies through the world (He had come all the way from a frozen land, full of goblins, and a mythed dragon named Vox!) he had led quite the life, as had his elven counterpart, Sir Greyfax, he was one of knowledge, and scripture, he knew all about libraries, and scrolls, and even the Arcane wisdom flowed through him, I'd never seen such a bright person..<br>
<br>
It was after that night they told me I was welcome with their clan, they were known as the Blood Of The Phoenix, I thought surely I would make a fine addition to their family, and perhaps I'd find what I'd always been missing at home.<br>
<br>
It was to no avail, after years of slaying monsters, and getting to my new family, we weren't as compatible as I'd once hoped, they had powers far beyond me, and it was then I realized I was merely a tag-along, and I told Beowulff and Greyfax this, they disagreed of course, and I was told I was vital to the family, but I new in my heart I belonged elsewhere, it was then I departed the Blood Of The Phoenix, though certainly not the last I'd see of them, in search of a new home, and new friends..<br>
<br>
It was mere days later that I was venturing the commonlands, in search of better weapons, and better armors, to help my days in Norrath, perhaps even to bleed that much less.. to no avail, I couldn't find suitable armors, as I'd already purchased smithed armour before, and there wasn't any bronze armours that would fit a warrior of my stature, perhaps even the rest of Norrath knew I was too small to fight..<br>
<br>
Disheartened, and ready to give up on my quests to better myself, I was asked by a beautiful wood elven mistress by the name of Jaxy to join a party that would involve slaying orcs, I knew this would be a great challenge to prove my worth, and a challenge it was, most of these orcs were of great size, and equal fighting capability, but they were no match for the power of the Funk(tm), they fell quickly, perhaps though I should give credit to the servant of nature healing my bands, not to mention another elf that seemed even stranger than the one who called upon nature's power..<br>
<br>
His name was Elvez, and I was to find out later, he called himself, songmastah, I thought to myself, &quot;How is his flute healing me?&quot;, but to each his own, he was good at what he did, and it even made me get up a few times, and shake my booty (_/_)(_\_)(_/_) a few times along side the elf..<br>
<br>
Although I didn't know it at the time these people were what ended up being exactly what I needed, the family I had longed for in Norrath, although I was hesitant to join another clan so soon, I felt it was imperative that I not turn down this chance..<br>
<br>
It was then I was born again, into the Soul Cadre, a fledgling family indeed, one where I was not a tag-along, and I was of equal skill as my counterparts, my friends..<br>
<br>
Then, I hit level 20, made my last name Omatic, and made a chanter on Bristlebane..<br>
<br>
The end..<br>
<br>
BTW, I made out with Gartook lots and lots at guild meetings..<br>
