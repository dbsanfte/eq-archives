He looks over the group of robe-clad fellows, chuckling to himself as he recognizes their inherent weaknesses and lack of personal prowess until his eyes come across a great sight...A mighty fellow indeed.  The great Ogre stands tall, and large to say the least, occupying a good quarter of the barn with his brown armor and gnarled face.  Bazzer's eyes quickly pass over this one, as he could be trouble...and then he spots a short little man, wearing a variety of armors, crouching at his feet; apparently trying to hide from the hungry Ogre's face.<br>

They look up at the downtrodden wee Halfling going by and motion him over.<br>
<br>
&quot;What's up, Heg?&quot; Softdale says.<br>
<br>
&quot;Bah, I can't play with those big guys.&quot; the wee rogue says.<br>
<br>
Storgue and Softdale exchange glances and they smile.<br>
<br>
&quot;Come with us.&quot;  Storgue says.<br>
<br>
They lead young Heggley to a secret door at the back of the pub and they step through.  Inside is a pool of crystal clear water and with a wave of her hand, and magics granted by Tunare, Softdale points at the pool and says &quot;Look!&quot;.  <br>
<br>
Within it's swirling depths, Heggley peers.  He sees Durangelo fighting mighty birds, Leache scowling at ferocious spiders, and Sarlis downing drinks in between telling his pet to kill Gnolls.  In another vision he can see Sildiil, Spence and Tubba all bringing to by the minions of Cazic Thule.  And in another scene, Gortle winks in and out of his hiding as he stalks evil.<br>
<br>
Softdale beams a smile at Heggley.  &quot;Do you see now, Heg?&quot; she says, as she puts her arm around him.  &quot;You're not alone.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;But I did so want to play with those big guys...&quot; Heg says again, looking sad, but not quite as much as before.<br>
<br>
Softdale sighs and then chuckles.  She waves her hand across the pool again.<br>
<br>
&quot;Look again&quot; says Storgue.<br>
<br>
This time the scenes change entirely to great ruins in the middle of brown fields and Devolux is there.  Upon closer inspection you can see his concentration etched deeply in his face as he diligently plays gems.  The scene shifts and Bazzer idly twirls his knife in the air while he adjust the sign over his head: &quot;Looking For Group&quot;.  Liela is seen next; her lithe figure slumped in frustration as she once again explains to a newbie the intricacies of large group raids.  <br>
<br>
The final scene shows a lithe wolf sitting on it's haunches in your familiar family home of Misty Thicket occasionally launching spells to young halflings and saying &quot;Dammit, I'm buffing you - isn't that enough?  No, I'm not going to give you Phaat Lewt!&quot;  Azrael was never one for subtlety.<br>
<br>
A hand waves over the pool in finality and it goes clear.  Heggley steps back and looks at Storgue and Softdale.  A slow smile spreads across Heggley's face.  Whistling, he leaves the little room with the mystical pool and continues on his merry way.<br>
<br>
Maybe, just maybe, being lower in level is enough for now.<br>
