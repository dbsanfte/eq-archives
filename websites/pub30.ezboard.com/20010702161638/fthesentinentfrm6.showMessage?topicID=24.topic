[Sun Apr 22 17:46:21 2001] Galadrid says out of character, 'but the treasury is there for everyone to use and if its not being used then its a failure so how can we make it so that people would use it?'<br>
[Sun Apr 22 17:46:42 2001] Ghardson says out of character, 'More awareness of it maybe?'<br>
[Sun Apr 22 17:46:45 2001] Galadrid says out of character, 'for now all items are just rotting in there'<br>
[Sun Apr 22 17:46:50 2001] Xiltin says out of character, 'I think it's all ready to be used, just need someone who can take care of getting on to dish out the items.'<br>

[Sun Apr 22 17:48:06 2001] Gaebrael says out of character, 'i believe that it is because of problemings connecting in the game that the message board was where connections were to be arranged.'<br>
[Sun Apr 22 17:48:07 2001] Galadrid says out of character, 'normally the way it works is that if someone wants an item they post that they would like it, and teynor will take care of the rest'<br>
[Sun Apr 22 17:48:10 2001] Germish says out of character, 'problem is he is 9 out of 10 times anon'<br>
[Sun Apr 22 17:48:35 2001] Galadrid says out of character, 'so even if you don't see him, you should post and he'll get back to you'<br>
[Sun Apr 22 17:48:46 2001] Brambler says out of character, 'I think like Galadrid said the treasury is supposed to be mainly done through the message board'<br>

[Sun Apr 22 17:48:55 2001] Ghardson says out of character, 'Could I make a suggestion?'<br>
[Sun Apr 22 17:48:58 2001] Legchopper says out of character, 'why not have designated times you can take things out...bank hours so to speak...for example once or twice a week at desigated times'<br>
[Sun Apr 22 17:49:11 2001] Galadrid says out of character, 'from when I talked to tey, he gets back to the people that post in game'<br>
[Sun Apr 22 17:49:14 2001] Xiltin says out of character, 'Good idea, if possible to accomplish.'<br>
[Sun Apr 22 17:49:16 2001] Ilrissa says out of character, 'or E mail him if you are not getting a response'<br>
[Sun Apr 22 17:49:23 2001] Ahaz says out of character, 'ugh. That's a nasty commitment for Tey though'<br>

[Sun Apr 22 17:49:41 2001] Xiltin says out of character, 'I have an idea'<br>
[Sun Apr 22 17:49:41 2001] Nyleshia says out of character, 'perhaps we could bring items we want to share to the meetings'<br>
[Sun Apr 22 17:49:52 2001] Legchopper says out of character, 'having a certain time is better can having to be at everyone call 42/7'<br>
[Sun Apr 22 17:49:52 2001] Ghardson says out of character, 'Might I suggest an assistant to Tey?'<br>
[Sun Apr 22 17:50:09 2001] Kagenotora says out of character, 'I wouldn't mind assisting Tey'<br>
[Sun Apr 22 17:50:19 2001] Ahaz says out of character, 'get a port class to be assistant'<br>
[Sun Apr 22 17:50:23 2001] Legchopper says out of character, 'I respectfully disagree...I think certain hours are LESS work that having to leave your group all the time'<br>

[Sun Apr 22 17:50:57 2001] Xiltin says out of character, 'If Teynor's &quot;treasurer&quot; is in FP, then anyone who wants to get something, should have a mule in FP. Then its just a matter of 2 mins switching chars. If the person has all 8 char slots filled, then resort to Teynor's times of trade.'<br>
[Sun Apr 22 17:51:12 2001] Galadrid says out of character, 'ok we can try that, if you would like to volunteer, get with tey'<br>
