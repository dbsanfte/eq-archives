<br>
I'm not real sure if I was terribly clear when I was yapping tonite in Guildchat, and I think Crimsyn was about to take my place in the group in question so hopefully I can get the lowdown on what went on after I had to leave for work <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

Logged in round 10ish for my 45 minute xp fest at the Treant camp.  The group was compromised of a few folks that have been there a couple of days, which was great 'cause we all got along very well.  Loot was double alpha, and admittidly named loot wasn't discussed beforehand and I'm not too sure anyone really knew named loot droped there(I didn't hehe).  So we have me as ShouMai, Eberheradt groupleader and Pally, Linivii another Pally, Kaylin our beloved Cleric, Deseray Manson much loved Enchanter(and soon to be wronged!) and Illumsomething or nother(sounded like light heheh).  Anyway, we are collecting up the xp and phat lewtz from the dead trees and things are going great, take down two and someone says &quot;Look another!&quot;, we all charge it, I had to wait for a damn root to wear off.  We take down Grizzleknot pretty easy, and Kaylin says Eb should loot it and we get back to our spot and roll.  Grizzleknot drops a Cloak of Leaves soemthing like 5 ac +7 agi/+10 hps all/all...looked it up tonite on EQPrices and it goes for like 590pp, nice item.  Sounds like a plan, he loots, we go back and roll.  Deseray gets a 98, I was the only one even close with a 70.  Everyone else was in the less than 50 range, clearly Deseray's cloak right?  Well the Pally Linivii starts saying Des shouldn't get it, Linivii &quot;pulled&quot; the named and Des is rude so boot her and the rest will roll(think she meant this in a tell, not sure).  Eb keeps offering Linivii some head for a Pally quest and she keeps saying she doesn't want it, Kaylin says she isn't rolling for the cloak she doesn't need it.  So Des asked for her cloak, Eb doesn't give it up and Lin keeps prattling on how Des is rude and shouldn't get it.  I grouped with both of them the other day, and both seemed quite nice actually.  Nothing different was going on, Des was dealing crack like she had her own lab and I had quickness within seconds of telling her it went down, all melees where awhacking and the Cleric kept us all alive.I told them Des got the roll its her cloak.  Well Treants keep popping and we keep bringing em down, and the whole cloak issue is debated inbetween kills.  I tell them I have to go in like 5 mins, give Crimsyn my spot and Des should get the cloak she won the roll.  Still no cloak giving, I say fine, I had the next highest roll and I want her to have it so I abdicate my roll to Des, na na.  Still no cloak giving...man I hope she got it, at the time I don't think most of us knew its worth but Justice is Justice, and Right is Right.  It was her cloak fair n square, I continued to tell them that, and Crim tells me to have her petition so I did, and she did tell me right before I logged that it was in the que.  I couldn't believe the whole situation, really hope it got solved.<br>
<br>
Anyway, thats my story for the day...if anyone has some insights please give em, and Tey if you have and ending for it, I'm jonseing for the info hehe!  No clear villian for shitlisting on Lanys, cept maybe the Linivii chic who the groupleader was listening to for some reason..I dunno, a rather sad way to leave the night.<br>
Sorry for the length.<br>

Example: Velious was new new, a group of us jump into the Rygorr orc camp in Eastern wastes...Chief pops (drops Rygorr mail). Im the only tank, we had established need before greed before the fact. Kill the chief, he drops mail, I roll 100 /grin. All the sudden loot rules change, and the drop goes to the nekro..why? Cause he split the spawn they say..hmm. To make the rest of my story brief, I lost 16 rolls for the BP before finally winning it due to greed, shifty loot rules, etc. I chose to deal with it thou; there was nothing else I could do due to the fact that the GMs are all politicians now and not fair rule makers (IMO)...So as sticky as those situations are, I guess you just gotta weigh the good and the bad, decide what you are up to dealing with, and either stick with the group agreeing to disagree or get out while the gettings good... <p>Gajiin Tsunami

Im not sure how I would react if something like this happend to me.  Probably really negitively.  So I try not to put myself in that sort of situation.<br>

AFTER the group had split of course, it was just she and I there trying to hold it at the time..hehe.  Anyway, the GM talked to everyone who had been in the group that was still on, then just left, and Deseray didn't get crap.<br>
<br>
Now I too have grouped with Deseray and Lin in the past, and both seemed pretty nice to me.  I gotta' say though, Des handled it really badly.  Just after Shoumai left, she starts /ooc and /shout'ing to the zone that Lin is a bad, greedy person who should not be grouped with, and she's spamming the group.  Finally our cleric said she couldn't take the arguing anymore and left, as did the 'chanter and Eberheardt (who, by the way, still has the Cloak I believe).<br>
<br>
Anyway, she ended up getting nothing and will probably have a hard time getting groups in that zone now....gotta' love good ole' EverCamp.  :-)<br>

Really disappointing in a big way, you always assume Justice will be served, or I do at least.  I am really naive(sp?),and when bad crap like that happens I am usually flabergasted by the whole situation.  I reckon is does just happen sometimes, really sad though and its hard to say if I would trust the others again to group with (I plan on hitting 30 or so with them bad trees!).  It goes go to show how much better Guild Groups are than pickups, I agree with what Hal said in the meeting...these Gob Mines Groups we had were awesome, most fun I have since Najena I think and that was again a Guild Thang hehe.
