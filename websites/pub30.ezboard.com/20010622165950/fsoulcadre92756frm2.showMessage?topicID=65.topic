We have no one (according to the trade skills page) that can make poisons above 100 skill. So I'm taking the bull by the horns to be the one. Granted, i know it's not profitable at all (how many rogues do you know that use poisons?) but I would feel great knowing I supplied Bazzer, Fathferd or the just about planes ready Storgue with a mysterious resin that could do a measly 250+ damage in a single hit. Call me deranged or whatever, but I'll be using my special blends when I feel the urge. <br>
<br>
Yes, The craft is quite expensive, but I have this uncanny whim to be completely broke and have a bank full of deadly toxins. like I said, call me deranged....<br>
<br>
Anyhow, I'll be checking out the raid signups, seeing who is next on the hitlist. if I may be able to concoct a mixture to help, I will do so. It may not be much, but I'll feel as if i helped, at least in the smallest way. <br>
<br>
Guild rogues - if there is a raid you are going on, and you would like to use a special toxin, let me know, I'll do my best. I do not need the exact one you need, just a vauge implication....  <br>
      ex: I'm doing this undead guy in Kith, have anything that could help?<br>
      res: sure, I can make a nasty undead only toxin that would do...hmmm, you're level 55, right?...about 300 or so of extra damage to that measly 25+ of your dagger. I'll make you a few..<br>
<br>
just trying to start a bit of interest in my wares. I figure if there's even the smallest interest in it, that will encourage me even more....<br>
<br>
that's enought rambling....<br>
<br>
to sum it up = Guild rouge who would like a dose of poison for their blades, give me a yell<br>
<br>
Thankies,<br>

Let me know what kind of components you need and where to get them. If I am in the area and see a few drop, I will save them for the poison makers of SC.<br>
<br>
I believe Storgue is a poison maker also, but I don't know his level of skill.<br>

I am working on it also so here is a bit of wisdom i have distilled from my work.<br>
<br>
Rogue get the apply poison skill first.  If you are leveling fast put off putting a point into this to get the most from your basic learning - if not, tox under fp will take 20 gp and 2 snake sacs and make you a poison and give exp.  <br>
<br>
Apply skill caps at 200 (5 per level) and is the hardest to raise.  I have not seen the success rate change much, it is always very high, but the TIME you spend sitting drops considerably, which is very important.   Fath is only 100 and Bazzer is les than that, and I am approaching 90 i think, so there is no such thing as a &quot;bad&quot; poison if we can use it to raise people's apply skill.  Save the cheap stuff, even the snake poison can raise the apply skill.  I had always assumed the skill increase for this was checked against Dex or maybe Agil like other combat skills, but i noticed many more skill dings on average while I had my intell gear on and was applying rancid wolf killer, so go figure.<br>
<br>
When we talk about make poison there are three factors here.  First lowering the cost of attempt.  You can do this in several ways.  Farming components is great.  You still need to buy some components.  For this i recommend some faaction work and char gear.  I have found my investment in char gear to get above 105 (not easy for a halfling) has paid for itself many many times over.  Leather neck raider skill cap is an easy 10, I also got a crude stein for 20 pp, 2 opaline ears for 5 each, two 7 char bracers, and some 4 or 5 char items for face and neck.  I keep em all in a pack and chenge when buying or selling stuff.<br>
<br>
As you know you can farm a lot of stuff solo, unrest and lavastorm aint bad, but when grouped don't be shy about asking for component drops.  I always give the casters the runes and pages and expect the same in return.  Many people in Sol A and B are pretty bad about this. <br>
<br>
Lastly is pottery which is now a good skill (Gate to Thrugadin potion, no drop but nice) and of course poison vials.  I am 2 points from making it now, but zombie skins stack and are the key/critical component for making vials so farm or buy in unrest and check the merchants in oaisis and the ro's frequently.  Black wold pelts in mistyand rv can work but they are heavy and don't stack so use em right away.  <br>
<br>
If you save up skins we can do a vial making session in RV or Thrugadin anytime ya want.  Will save us a TON of money, merchants charge over 6 pp per Sealed vial and we can make em for less, it adds up. <br>
<br>
The skill increase for poison making appears to check vs. the higher of you intell or wisdom, so i have a good set of intell gear to wear when going for skill dings. good intell gear is MUCH more expensive, but I can loan you my stuff for a session if you line up your materials first. <br>
<br>
Since the finished product does NOT stack, you are quickly forced to either apply (for apply skill) or sell back to a merchant (faction and char gear).  Ideally, you get your make poison skill up 20 points higher than the actual poison you want to make and apply in the field since you will be wearing combat gear then and carry a LOT more poison that way.  This will also be how we feed our higher level rogues stuff to apply in the field and up their apply poison skill.<br>
<br>
Note that since in many cases the most expensive component is the vial, picking a poison way ABOVE (say 50) your current skill may be a cheaper way of &quot;skilling up&quot; since when you fail you get the vial back.   <br>
<br>
Even some of the lower poisons are awesome.  I highly reccomend rancid wolf killer and animal 1 poison.  It's fairly cheap, you can buy all the components in L fay, and while it doesn't effect lava drakes in LS or Lave beetles and kobolds in Sol B it does do a 250 DD for me against the hated Sonic bats there.  It does not effect spiders but does snakes and i imagine it would do wonders in OT, you might even be able to solo some near the zone with that poison.<br>
<br>
Thanks and Good Luck<br>
