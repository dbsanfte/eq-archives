size=1> As most of you know, I gave my final in-game farewell last night and passed the torch of leadership to one of the oldest remaining members in the guild, Galadrid.  I started playing with Galadrid/Shadoir from almost the very beginning of my time in EQ and we have almost always been on the same sheet of music in terms of ideas, directions, and issues.  Without a doubt, he is the most qualified and experienced member of this guild to pick up the torch and carry on.  I dare say he is more fit than I am to be the GL and will do a much better job (this is my sincere personal conviction).  Therefore, I hope you will provide him with your loyalty and support.  He is a good, honest, hard-working man with a deep history in this guild, and he truly cares about it and you.<br><br>As to why I am leaving the guild, and most probably EQ altogether, there are several reasons:<br><br>1)  I am moving to Germany for the next three years with my family.  While this might not initially kill my playing time, it has allowed me to refocus on my RL and the direction I am heading.  For one, it wouldnt be fair to this guild or its members if I remained the GL but was never in the game.  This, without a doubt, is the PRIMARY reason I have chosen to step down and out of this guild and this game.  Its time I re-focused my direction for my family and myself, and the amount of time needed for this game and the GL position just doesnt allow for as much re-focus as I desire.  While two additionaly impacts are detailed below, this is truly the reason I am calling it quits.<br><br>2)  I do not enjoy this game anymore.  I began this game really enjoying my time in an alter reality.  It was fun to get away into EQ and play, fun to hook up with my friends and get into this endless world.  This changed, however.  I no longer enjoy my time in-game and no longer feel the game provides an escape.  I thought maybe my feelings towards the game would change if I spent some time away from it.  I found out though, once I had not been playing habitually, that I am more relaxed and happier when I dont care about what items I need to be uber, what mobs are popping that have my shiat, where I can level the fastest, what is the best class to play, why are 75% of the people I meet in this game total assholes (anonymity)...  When a 'game' is no longer fun, I seriously dont see the need to spend the time with it anymore.  This issue had a direct impact on number 1 above.<br><br>3)  Things changed.  Unfortunately this has to do with the guild.  One of the greatest things about this game was the friends I made in this alter-world who made my time enjoyable.  For quite sometime, however, things have changed and I have spent most of my supposed in-game time dealing with endless bitching and bickering.  Oh, not out in the open of course, always in secret tells to the GL only.  I wonder if you have any idea how many /tell bitch messages I actually received during any given playing night?  I hope you all know that there is no course that can be taken that will satisfly everyone.  This issue had a direct impact on number 2 above.<br><br>So there it is.  There is nothing about my decision that is personal or aimed at anyone in particular.  Again, it is primarily because of my move to Germany.  I will seriously miss this guild that I started so long ago, worked so hard to build, and spent so much time organizing and directing.  Believe me, over its history it has been no small amount.  But, I will mostly miss the great people I have become such good friends with.  <br><br>I hope all of you continue to do what you enjoy doing, always.  I also hope that you will take a step back from time to time and look at how you impact upon the people around you.  Sometimes its more of an impact than you know.<br><br>Robert Scott Loxley<br>Mordwin Kordravvia<br><br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub30.ezboard.com/uhaldorrodlah.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Haldor Rodlah</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 23<br> <font color=#333333>(1/31/01 11:16:36 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub30.ezboard.com/fthesentinentfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=155.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_cry.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Final Farewell</span><hr size=1> From the number one whiner (although not to you personally that I remember) in the guild I must say that I am sad to see you go. Although we were never close "friends" I still think you did an admiral job of running a very fast growing guild. <br><br>As far as dealing with uber equipment and upper lvl mobs/quests, all of us should remember that THIS IS A GAME! Will it help you get a promotion in your job if your character has a Yak or an Advisor's robe? I doubt it. On the other hand, will it help you get a promotion in your job if your family life and self well being is stable? Probably.<br><br>I wish you all the success in the world Robert and I hope your life is as great as you want it to be and will make it be. Thank you for all the time and effort you have given us over the months (years?) as our guild leader and my personal apologies for any undesirable comment directed to you or this wonderful guild you created.<br><br>To the rest of us, lets remember this moment before sending any complaint or gripe to Galadrid. Let us ask ourselves, "Is this complaint trully neccissary to my survival or is it a personal want?". Galadrid will make a fine GL IMO. Let's not ruin that as our GL is very much our voice and our support when dealing with other guilds or with Verant itself.<br><br><br>Again best of luck in all of your ventures Mordwin.<br><br>Jason Hanmore <p><IMG SRC="http://www.geocities.com/haldor13021/1FACE.gif">Haldor Rodlah "The Crazy Druid"</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub30.ezboard.com/ucaederedraconis.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Caedere Draconis</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 55<br> <font color=#333333>(2/1/01 1:40:26 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub30.ezboard.com/fthesentinentfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=155.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.thesentinent.com/redmage.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Final Farewell</span><hr size=1> Something I found in the log (three consecutive lines) best describes my reaction...<br><br>[Wed Jan 31 21:12:26 2001] Mordwin is now an officer of your guild.<br>[Wed Jan 31 21:12:26 2001] Galadrid is now the leader of your guild.<br>[Wed Jan 31 21:12:27 2001] You are stunned! <p><b>Caedere Draconis, "Ranjuh Pet" Protégé of 33 Tall Tales</b><br><FONT Size=1>"A Native American elder once described his own inner struggles in this manner: 'Inside of me there are two dogs.
