<br>
Here goes:  I was in Warsilk's Woods, kicking around the Brutes and had just gotten the intact choppers of a Pygmy(for my next shackle quest), when I hear someone hollering for more folks at the Giant Fortress.  I had been LFG for about an hour or so, as soloing can get a bit boring and inquired, I was accepted...C'mon down!  <br>
<br>
Woot omw, well I get there and it is a troll shammy named Littelsarge from Dark Reign(I think) and a Necro plus another caster.  Well, as I'm invited in, the shammy pulls an Evergreen(yellow to me, no problem).  During the course of the battle, I seem to be the only one hitting it with anything...kept announcing MENDING when I was down a bit, but the shammy kept burnin' mana on heals(which is fine) till he was oom.  That was not a problem, he jumped up and started poking it with his spear, by then I'm down to 2 bubs of health and no mend...don't see the Necro's pet anywhere anymore, and I'm honestly not sure if it died or he called it off.  With a couple of smacks, I'm down to one bub and I back off and start FDing...shammy hollers &quot;Everyone melee!!&quot;.  Kickass I think, its down to less than a bub of health and they can take him if my FD ever works.  Then what really lit my fire happened, one caster says oom(duh) and the other says, &quot;No I cannot melee.&quot;  Well, I died and lost the exp I had acquired thru the evening, very annoying for someone as casual a player as myself.  That would have been np except for the, &quot;I can't melee&quot; thing.  With the beastie down that low, it wouldn't have been a big deal to stand up and poke it a bit(they all 3 were at full health, none gone whatsoever).<br>
<br>
To his credit, Littelsarge keeps saying sorry it happened.  I said it wouldn't be a problem, if the others hadn't point blank refused to help, so I literally said thanks alot for that(inflamatory, I know).  One of them then makes a smartass remark that sent me over the edge, so I tell them buh bye and disband.  The shammy then starts giving me tells saying how &quot;gay&quot; I am, and neither myself or anyone from the Sentinent will be welcome in his guilds groups, etc.  I asked him how he can be pissed at me when I died, no one else did...so obviously the could have handled taking the offense on the giant?  So to that he just tells me I'm f%&amp;*ing lame and stop talking to him.<br>
<br>
Well, I went back and got my stuff and moved on, thinking back on it, maybe I did get too mad...and more importantly, I'm worried my actions reflected poorly on the Guild as a whole.  Whaddaya think?<br>
<br>

The group wants to keep pulling Avocets. These are all conning red to Elmarra. I keep saying they are going to resist. But they pull anyway. Guess what they resisted everything in my bag of tricks. I have been resisted before so this is nothing new but the group is caster heavy and I am the highest one.<br>
<br>
We have a Ogre warrior a DE thief, Cleric, Enchanter, Mage, and a Wizard. The ogre is the lowest. The ogre is bashing away and the Thief is back stabbing. The cleric is casting one heal after another. The mages air pet is in there but doesnt look like it is doing alot of damage. Me I am casting my fingers off resist resist resist. The ogre goes down and everyone is taking a beating. I am oom so into the fray I go. We won just barely.<br>
<br>
A little while later they pull another one. I tell the group casters that if it resists to melee right away. This time it goes alot better. The ogre is only down 2 bubs and the thief one. All I did was apply a little common sense.  IF YOU ARE GOING TO BE RESISTED, HIT IT! Dont wait for the Tanks to die and then have to melee it by yourself. I dont know about my counterparts but I am dishing out 18 points of damage when I do hit. I am quite sure if someone takes a hundred points off A MOB the melee guys arent going to complain to much.<br>
<br>
The wizards guide says to try and do without a weapon after lvl 20. Well I am 24 now and you can have my staff when you pry it from my cold dead fingers. Ive taken my share of beatings at the hands of angry MOBs but I stand my ground melee. If I have mana I try to root. and when all else fails I press my hot key for /loc. and go down swinging.<br>
<br>
Have your casters melee if they are resisted it takes less mana for your healer to heal a caster than it does a tank. Plus if their spells arent doing anything they arent doing anything, and dont deserve the xp or the loot.   <br>
<br>
Feel free to NUKE my post. Just be careful it might be resisted, and I still know how to melee. Do you?<br>

I wouldnt give any credence to it at all, anyone who would make a statement which not only trys to extend his beef with you to your guild members who had nothing to do with it, but trys to say that all his guild, who also had nothing to do with it, wont group with you either (after you did NOTHING wrong to begin with), is obviously talkin outta his ass.

-------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
- We do NOT condone childish behavior or mentality. Getting in arguments in the game with other players, guild members, Apprentice Guides, Guides, GMs, or other EQ Staff members in local message, /tell, /ooc or /shout is not tolerated. It is more honorable to be above arguments and be on your merry way than to sit around and make a fool out of yourself for the zone. When you carry the guild name Dark Reign next to your player name, you carry a symbol of pride, responsibility, trust and honor. Your actions are directly reflected onto the organization that you belong to and inappropriate actions bring disservice to the entire guild, not just you the individual. If you have beef with ANYONE, keep it in /tell and keep it civil. There is to be no bad mouthing other guild mates, including /guild chat. If you have beef with a guild mate, do it in /tell and keep it private. Morale is a huge aspect of any guild and poor morale has been the cause of many a guilds' demise.<br>
<br>
<br>
- The members of the guild should be kind and considerate to other players, lest they act like asses and do not deserve such respect. In that case, those people are to be ignored and not vocally chastised. Let their actions speak louder than your words. Helping other players is suggested. You never know who will be a future guild mate and/or ally. Treat others with respect as much as possible and do so with pride. Guild mates who do not seek honor will not hold the guild name Dark Reign by their name for very long.<br>

Since I dual weild steins, I cant attack (even though people say you can bash with them, you cant.  They have no damage or delay stats).  So when my spells are resisted everytime even after I tashani the target, I just make sure my tanks have my best buffs:  Alacrity, any str or AC buffs I have if there isnt someone else who can give them better ones, and sometimes dmg shield.  That's about all I can do.  <br>
But when I wasnt dual weilding steins, you better believe I was stabbing away with my sacraficial dagger or dragoon dirk every chance I got.  I tried to keep my melee skill up as high as I could.<br>
<br>
And as far as not being invited into a group by anyone in his guild or him,.........so.  I could care less if that was the route him or they wanted to go (not saying that's how it is, but if it were so).   With some of the stuff he said Id look at it as one less idiot I would have to worry about accidentally grouping with, and being sorry I did afterwards.  Heck at least you told them you were leaving before you disbanded, which is a good thing to practice.  <br>
<br>
So all in all, I dont think you were wrong.  Ive been in your shoes to where all my nights work had basically been thrown away in a matter of minutes because of something someone in my group could have prevented.  And if things aren't going well in your group, why not let them know how you feel and disband? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub30.ezboard.com/utaladan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Taladan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Sentinent Member</span><br>  Posts: 188<br> <font color=#333333>(3/7/01 2:43:00 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Wrong?

A Shaman OOM?  Caster even?  And a pet that's in a coma?<br>
<br>
Yep definetly a bad group from what you say.  But to top it off the &quot;personal&quot; conflict between you and the Shaman just bites.  I have seen, well heard, much of this &quot;My Guild wont this and wont that&quot; lately and it's getting a bit old. Idle threats is all .. they simply are trying to inflict pain by doing so. <br>
<br>
I personally would not take the words of any one member of a guild, especially a loose cannon like this one seems to be, as  any indication of anything more than a waste of my time reading it. They no more represent thier Guilds veiw than a tree stump would.  Which in a way is good .. cause if they did .. would be a bad reflection upon them and I would consider it no loss on my part .. and much on theirs.<br>
<br>
Just play your game Bro, you do it well, and take these events in stride. They can ruin a night or two even .. but don't let them stick to you.  Have fun .. rule number one.<br>

With due consideration of the fact that it really bites to die for no good reason and lose a night's work, this looks to me like OOTT (One Of Those Things), with a side order of rudeness.  I've been in a few groups like that that seem fated to lead to death.  It's amazing how this game permits people to survive when they seem to be completely ignorant of how to play (unlike us, of course <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ).  <br>
<br>
I wonder if that was one of the first kills of that group?  I've noticed that pick-up groups sometimes have people who just don't think alike in EQ terms, and it's usually fatal.  I always pull easy when I join a group and watch carefully the first few kills to see if everyone's on the same page or not.  If they are they can kill stuff WAY above average; if they're not they'll get killed by fire beetles.<br>
<br>
No, you did nothing that reflects badly, in my opinion.  Just a nasty situation.  You forgot to look for the 'idiot' tag, didn't you? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Now granted, it was a blast, but it took about 3 min to kill the thing, and it had a sliver of life. So instead of dishing out 40 points of damage in 3 min, they could have meded up and nuked for 400, in half the time.<br>
<br>
  Situation 2. I &lt;Meudir, we were lvl 15&gt; was in Tim Deep with Crimsyn hunting skellies, and it went bad. I was oom, Crim was running around kiting the skellie, while I was medding. Now if I stepped in there and tried to melee it, I would have died. No question. So I medded while Crim kited and finally got the kill shot on it.<br>
<br>
  That's just my 2cp on the whole caster meleeing deal, but like Sent said, it just sounds like on of those Moron groups. Lord knows we've all had them. Just make sure to put them on the DUMBASS list and never group with them again.<br>

I notice some parallels here with my post on the monk named Feriss. If you haven't read it check it out. What I did was a /w all &quot;guild in question&quot; and contacted someone to get an officer and told them of the threat that had been made. As in your case the guild had no idea of the propositioned threat and didn't support it. I imagine the guild in question had some choice words for their guildie for overstepping his authority and making their guild look bad. <br>
<br>
That might be worth noting as what I feel is the most effective response to date. I know of another situation involving the Sentinent once where I turned the problem over to the guild and justice was served. Seems to be the most level headed approach although if you get better ideas lemme know them :-). <br>
<br>
In response to the melee approach I have said in group on two occasions that I can't melee. My gamestyle is different (not better, just different) then Elmarra's here. I quested and got my staff of the wheel in my low 20's and never had opportunity to melee much once I hit my teens. If I were to melee I would be attacking with a 10dmg 100dly weapon. With a skill of about 60.

One thing I really do like(and the main reason I posted here) is that I know I can lay it on the table and get real opinions, not just no you were right.  I really do appreciate the point/counterpoints we can come up with.<br>
<br>
I didn't give much credence to his &quot;you can't come to my house and play anymore&quot; @#%$, I bet the majority of his guild would be pissed to know that he feels powerful enuff to make such declarations.  Despite that, I have every intention of letting this just die there in WW.  Last nite was a bit of a pile up effect, the night before my group had some freak turd being PL'd and trying to KS us.<br>
<br>
Anyway, he can suck my butt...and thanks again guys, I hadn't really thought of how someone actually couldn't melee(but I would have tried at least, hehe).<br>
<br>

I seem to have caused offence with my post here and was called to task. I've been feeling like crap ever since so alow me to clarify my stance. My offence skills and 1HB are in the 60's. My weapon Delay is 100. This means after my attack finally occues it's usually a miss. Thus when a situation occurs where the extra melee would be necessary I still can't participate. I honestly tried to melee a skeleton one day that aggroed me at the Nek Spire. After 5 minutes my red bar was lower than his and I finally got pissed off anf hit it for 310. This is a level what? -8? or so? So against even blues I'm useless on the melee. I med, either to get another nuke, or for evac if necessary. If they're gonna kill the mob without me then great I've got that much more mana for the next pull. I salute those Wizards who've maintained their utility by keeping good melee weapons and upgrading their melee skills, but I&quot;m too lazy to try and upgrade them now for myself, and I don't see me giving up my 100 delay weapon, whith it's +10int and mana anytime soon cause it gives me more mana for nukes. <br>
<br>
I've been caught in groups a few times where they were fighting reds I couldn't touch with a nuke and I tend so tell them I'm baggage so I'll leave so that can grab someone who can contribute. Some groups get an odd red one which is an untypical pull, and those I simply med thru and prepare to port the group out if the battle turns to snot.<br>
<br>
I'm really sorry for the feelings I hurt. I've re-read my post and still don't quite understand how I came across so bad, but I'm in the wrong here I know cause I've developed several problems in this area in the past few weeks. Feriss, the idiot who duelled me the same night, my guildie here, and a poor Pally who mistook a bit of flippant sarcasm as a critique ( I said oh no! This place is full of undead and we're stuck with a pally for melee!) He said if he wasn't wanted he would leave... I honestly expected him to laugh, not feel hurt :-(.<br>
<br>
Good night all. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub30.ezboard.com/uanjulie.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Anjulie</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 12<br> <font color=#333333>(3/10/01 2:29:44 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Thanks!</span><hr size=1> Lazy or chicken? Depends on the situation. I would be right ripped myself in Sakk's situation, coming back on a CR and everyone at full health having a great old time.  They could've pitched in at least.  The same thing happened to me eons ago back in Oasis.  I was partnered up with a cleric and we were fighting crocs.  We were doing pretty ok, the cleric wanted to med and heal me while I fought.  Not the fastest way to get exp (bard = wannabe tank) but it was working alright, until I pulled a croc a little beyond my means.  I'm fighting, cleric's healing, then he goes OOM.  I end up dying, and on my way back, the cleric's apologizing to me, because he had managed to finish off the croc in one or two swipes just after I died.<br>
<br>
I let it slide, because he was apologizing, and I wasn't in the mood for a fight. In a situation such as that, it would be appreciated if the other people in the party would chip in what they can.  *But*, I've also been fighting with Ahaz for a while, and I know he doesn't melee.  (you gotta see him with the phat-lewt-uber staff trying to hit stuff, its kinda funny)  We work around it.  Same with Monarch's situation, he can't melee with the beer mugs, so he does what a chanter does.   Lately I've found myself in a lot of caster-heavy groups, and I can't remember a time when any of them jumped in and started swinging (except for my friend, the psycho-tank chanter Epicura, but he's another story all together).  If things are going bad, I switch on the speedy feet song and start yelling at people to run.<br>
<br>
So the point of my whole post?  I'm with Sakk and would've ripped a new hole into each member of that group if that had been me.  But I'm also saying that in certain situations, melee for casters isn't always feasible.  So my official standing on this topic is that I'm sitting on the fence.  (yeah, I'm a loser I know) Some big help I am huh?  And please believe Ahaz wasn't flaming anyone with his post.  He wouldn't do that, he likes you guys to much. <br>

Whatever for?</span><hr size=1> Ahaz, I read over your post again and can't see any reason why you should apologize at all.   You weren't rude and your points are valid.  If the tanks are almost down, the casters OOM, time to book it to the zone I say!  My little pecks with a club are not going to save anyone's arse, but that's from a level 49 perspective and the mobs we fight have at the very least over 5k hp's.  My max melee damage is 19.  <br>
<br>
Shoumai, perhaps these casters had higher lvl characters and are used to being useless at melee and didn't make an adjustment.  Sounds like it was bad pulls, bad judgment and definitely not a good group to be in.  It was perfectly reasonable to get the Hell out, I would have. <br>

But on the side note,  Elshara and myself group together alot most the time its just the two of us.  Both of our defence skills and weapon skills are maxxed at lest for the last level we were in (I am lv 36 and she is lv 35).  For those of you caster who think &quot;this is all I can do, blast whatever etc&quot; you should watch Elshara a enchter in combat.  She has tanked and will most like tank again yellow or even red mobs just so I can get heals off.  <br>
<br>
Also I find it in much distaste when we group with other casters or priests who start running the first time a mob looks at them.  Makes it very hard to heal them and for the tanks to pull the mob off them.  <br>
