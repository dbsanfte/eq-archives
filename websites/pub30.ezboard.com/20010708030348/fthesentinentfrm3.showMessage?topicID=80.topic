<font color="ff0000"><h1 align="CENTER"><b>Raid Plan</align></b></h1></font><br>
<br>
<dl><b>1. Transportation to Sol B</b><br>
<br>
<dl><li>Sol B is located in Lavastorm Mountains. You will need to either get a port to Lavastorm or hike from Freeport to West Commons to Nektulos Forest to Lavastorm Mountains. Everyone should plan on being outside Sol B about a half hour before the start of the raid so that they can be buffed and full mana when zoning into Sol B.<br>
<br>
<li>Melees can bind in either Freeport or Neriak depending on faction.</dl><br>
<br>
<b>2. Formation</b><br>
<br>
<dl><li>Once everyone is at the Sol B zone entrance, we will form up into our respective groups<font color="ff0000">*</font> and then zone into Sol B. At this time everyone should set up their appropiate hot keys (assists, assist calls, malo, mezzs, healing, etc...): <br>
<br>
<dd><b><u><font color="0000ff">Group 1</font></u></b></dd><br>
<dd>Galadrid (Group Leader)</dd><br>
<dd>Taansey (Primary Healer)</dd><br>
<dd>Aonedil (Puller)</dd><br>
<dd>Ghardson (Peeler & Main Assist)</dd><br>
<dd>Elshara (Crowd Control)</dd><br>
<dd>Thiaz (Speed/Buffer and Secondary Healer)</dd><br>
<br>
<dd><b><u><font color="0000ff">Group 2</font></u></b></dd><br>
<dd>Mordwin (Group Leader)</dd><br>
<dd>Mustela (Secondary Crowd Control)</dd><br>
<dd>Caedere (Secondary Assist & Snarer)</dd><br>
<dd>Elizae (Primary Healer)</dd><br>
<dd>Monarch (Buffer and Secondary Crowd Control)</dd><br>
<dd>Airranna (Nuker and Secondary Healer)</dd><br>
<br>
<dd><b><u><font color="0000ff">Group 3</font></u></b></dd><br>
<dd>Sentry (Group Leader)</dd><br>
<dd>Brambler (Primary Healer)</dd><br>
<dd>Laneer (Nuker and Secondary Healer)</dd><br>
<dd>Xaijin (Taunter)</dd><br>
<dd>Germish (Buffer and Secondary Healer)</dd><br>
<dd>Jumil (Backstabba)</dd><br>
<br>
<dd><font color="ff0000" size="1">*Groups and Roles are subject to change</font></dd></dl><br>
<br>
<dl><li>Once we have formed up, we will zone in and meet in BnB1 (Blue dot on map). Once everyone is in BnB1 Aonedil will start to pull and clear Nox Room (Green dot) if it isn't already cleared. For this portion of the raid Aonedil will just pull mobs to us to kill, but once we clear the Death Beetle room, we will switch over to tandem pulling as we did in CoM. I would ask everyone to please be patient as it will be confusing since we will be fighting in tight quarters until we reach the ramp.<br>
<br>
<li>When Nox Room has been cleared we will move into Nox room and camp there until death beetle (Red dot) has been cleared.<br>
<br>
<li>Once Death Beetle room is cleared we will move and camp in Death Beetle room where we can heal and med up.<br>
<br>
<li>Once we are buffed FM and FH, Aonedil will try to FD pull the Imp protectors from the ramp across the lava (Black Dot), and Ghardson will peel. If FD doesn't work on the first try, Aonedil will bring all 3 imps to room to be mezzed or PP'd (pull and parked). This part is tricky and will actually be the hardest part of the raid IMHO. Do NOT attack until Ghardson has called his assist.<br>
<br>
<li>Once we have taken out those three imps, Aonedil will go back across lava and try to pull in any stragglers. Once clear, we will all gather and go across the lava and heal and med AGAINST the back wall (Black dot). Do not wander up the ramp or you will aggro imps; if you do aggro the imps don't run back down to us, stay there and die and we will rez you, otherwise we'll all get killed.<br>
<br>
<li>Once we're ready, Aonedil will pull from up the ramp and clear out the three mobs (two Imps and Lava guardian) that spawn there. Once thats done, we will all go up the ramp and STAY against the wall. I can't emphasize this enough, we need to stay against the wall, I've been in raids where a person has stepped out only like 5 feet from the wall and aggro'd the imps from across the hall which ended up in a raid wipeout.<br>
<br>
<li>Aonedil will then pull the imp and lava guardian from further up the ramp and pull back to wall, keep mobs near wall so that other mobs do not aggro. Again, don't wander. There is a false stone about 10 feet away from the wall and you can fall in the lava.<br>
<br>
<li>We will all then follow the wall (stay against wall as you move) to the entrance to Efreeti's room. I forgot to mark this on the map, its where the tunnel opening to the purple dot is. Do NOT go past the puller and do not wander; stay close to everyone and everyone stay close to the wall before the efreeti room entrance. There is a fake bridge that will drop you into the lava below if you go 10 steps past the entrance.<br>
<br>
<li>Once there we will heal and med up, and then Aonedil will try to FD pull from Efreeti room (Purple dot). If successfull, we will be able to kill the Efreeti spawns one by one. I believe there are 4 spawns in efreeti room. Once Efreeti room is broken we will move in there and camp room.<br>
<br>
<li>If we feel comfortable and confident, we'll have Aonedil pull mobs from outside the room until 5 minutes before efreeti spawn time. The spawn time on the Efreeti or its PH is 22 minutes.</dl><br>
<br>
<b>3. Loots</b><br>
<br>
<dl><li>The imp protectors can drop a rusty (or dusty?) sash which is no-drop and which I believe our rangers need for a quest.<br>
<br>
<li>The Efreeti will always drop, either Golden Efreeti Boots (AC +5, INT +9, WIS +9 - Common drop) or Djarns Amethyst Ring (HP +80, AGI +9 - Rare drop). Only casters may roll for the GEBs and only Melee and Hybrids may roll for the Ring.</dl><br>
<br>
<b>4. Extraction and Back-up Plan</b><br>
<br>
<dl><li>Once the majority of us are satisfied with our stay we can all be ported out, OR we can move onto Fire Giants. Fire Giants will also be our back-up plan in case the Efreeti is already camped, which is a good possibility. I will guess that it will take us about a half-hour to an hour to clear to Efreeti room. Then lets say we stay 2 hours to camp the Efreeti, that will give us at least 6-7 Efreeti or its PH spawns. So all together we're looking at 3 hours. At the end of the 3 hours we can decide whether we want to stay, move onto FG's, or end the raid.</dl><br>

One what time is form up and where?  Are we gathering at the LS druid ring?  Since some of us, me included, has never been in solb a meet up inside might be a bit rough.  Second question since group one has no evac'ers will this be an option or the plan to go down dieing(dont mean to sound negative here, just like options).  Hehe of groups 2 and 3 have both primary and secondary evac'ers group one goes first right, ( if this is the plan Xaijin be in group one as Mordwin suggested push him out front while  everyone evacs /jk).  Also if we could get a list of suggested spell/abilities.  For example all the druids have fixation of ro, lowers ac and atack of target mob, who should cast it?  Which enchanter should tashen(does main crowd control do this?)?  Are we sticking with snare(ranger casting) to reduce druid taunt or should we (druids) try and ensnare so that it last alot longer?  <br>
<br>
I might be over cuatious/planning to the smallest detail, but I really dislike dungeons(something about no sow and running like a girl not working, hehe) and really like a very detailed plan.<br>

Been there for the last 6 lvls..hehe. One thing I do know is that where we're going...sow or no sow...if things go bad yer dead. 1 thing I might suggest is that at least one cleric bind near where we will be and be rdy to rez. With the groups we have we shouldn't have any problems as long as we follow Gal's plan to the letter. There are quite a few places in Sol B where you can accidently aggro unwanted mobs. Usually when that happens it's either try to get out or die fighting. One suggestion I do have though is make sure all casters able to levitate bring batwings. It will go smoother if we don't have to worry about falling into lava. If Anyone needs wings I know Haldor has some that he can spare. <p>Ghardson Megansbane

The Raid start time is 3pm EST, 12pm PST this Saturday 5-5-01. We should all start to gather outside the Sol B zone at around 2:30pm EST. If you don't know how to get to Sol b, wait at the Lavastorm Druid ring and someone will come get you. The ring is very close to the Sol B entrance.<br>
<br>
The reason that group 1 doesn't have an evacer is because there wasn't any room. The members in that group need to be in close communication with each other and unfortunately there wasn't any room left for an evacer. Hopefully though, we won't have to evac =). However, we should plan for the worst, so if worst comes to worst, then group 1 will go down giving the other two groups time to evac. I believe most everyone in group 1 knows the way out, so even though they might not make it to the zone, they can make it close enough where CR won't be a problem.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately Laneer, I'm not too familiar with the spells druids mem for dungeon crawling, but I'm sure Brambler could give a few pointers =). You could work it out with Brambler which of you will cast which spells. Who will heal, who will nuke, who will buff and so on. <br>
<br>
As for the snaring deal, we will stick with Caedere being the snarer so that he can use that in conjunction with his taunt; I'm assuming that, either or both, Musty or Xaijin will also be casting darkness, so we won't really have to worry too much about the mob running =).<br>

Fixation is always fun in dungeons especially since it wont break mez so on multi pulls you can have everything debuffed/snared before breaking mez.  As you may have guessed fire nukes dont go over well here so I guess Ice would be the only nuke we'll need, dots are pretty much useless as most stuff wont last long enough for them to do their full damage and will screw up mez if we gotta change targets for some reason.  My dungeon lineup is usually something like:<br>
<br>
sup Heal<br>
group chloro<br>
DS<br>
evac<br>
fixation<br>
snare<br>
root<br>
nuke<br>
<br>
