Thanks to Krystal for posting the directors cut version :-)

<b>Site down?!</b>
<p>

I've had some troubles with my ISP and keeping the line alive.
The only solution seems to be turning of the router, and then back on
once the line goes dead. Until my ISP assures me that the prob. is 
solved, I'm putting a timer on the box. This means that the line
<em>will</em> go dead twice a day... The upside is of course that
it will also be reset at least twice a day, so the longest possible
down time will be 12 hrs.

Just thought you should know :-)

Yours,
