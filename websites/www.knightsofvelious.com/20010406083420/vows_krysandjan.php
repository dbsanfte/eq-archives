<p>

<font color=#888888>Sanyora:</font>
Janaem, please repeat after me:
"Within my heart is the shelter of your love, within my soul is the fire that burns
only for you. Within my life, there is you, as my friend, my love, my life, and my
wife."
<p>

<font color=#888888>Janaem:</font>
Within my heart is the shelter of your love, within my soul is the fire that burns
only for you. Within my life, there is you, as my friend, my love, my life, and my
wife.
<p>

<font color=#888888>Sanyora:</font>
Krystal, please repeat after me:
"Within my heart is the shelter of your love, within my soul is the fire that burns
only for you. Within my life, there is you, as my friend, my love, my life, and my
husband."
<p>

<font color=#888888>Krystal:</font>
Within my heart is the shelter of your love, within my soul is the fire that burns
only for you. Within my life, there is you, as my friend, my love, my life, and my
husband.
<p>

<p>

<font color=#888888>Sanyora:</font>
Now you will feel no rain, for each of you will be shelter for the other.
Now you will feel no cold, for each of you will be warmth to the other.
Now there will be no loneliness, for each of you will be companion to
the other. Now you are two persons, but there is only one life before you.
May beauty surround you both in the journey ahead and through all the years. May
happiness be your companion and your days together be good and long upon Norrath." 
<p>


"Treat yourselves and each other with respect, and remind yourselves often of what
brought you together. Give the highest priority to the tenderness, gentleness and
kindness that your connection deserves. When frustration, difficulties and fear assail
your relationship, as they
threaten all relationships at one time or another, remember to focus on what is right
between you, not only the part which seems wrong. In this way, you can ride out the
storms when clouds hide the face of the sun in your lives -- remembering that even if
you lose sight of it for a
moment, the sun is still there. And if each of you takes responsibility for the quality
of your life together, it will be marked by abundance and delight." 
<p>


You may kiss your bride.
<p>


Gentle folk, I give you Mr. and Mrs. Spellsong
