WARNING<BR>
-------<BR>
<BR>
Apache should never be used as a production server under any <BR>
consumer operating system such as Windows 95, 98, or ME (Millennium <BR>
Edition).  Only Windows NT 4.0 or 2000 should be considered, and only<BR>
with appropriate NTFS file system and user security administration.<BR>
Apache runs on these consumer Windows environments only to <BR>
provide test, development or trusted intranet server platforms.<BR>
<BR>
Apache on Win32 should be considered initial-release quality code.  <BR>
It has not been subjected to the same stresses on its stability and <BR>
security that the Unix releases have enjoyed, so there is a greater <BR>
possibility of undiscovered vulnerabilities to stability or security<BR>
of the Win32 port.  <BR>
<BR>
Apache performs best, and is still most reliable on Unix platforms.<BR>
Over time the performance, reliability and security for the Apache<BR>
Win32 port has improved, and continues to improve.  Folks doing <BR>
comparative reviews of webserver performance are still asked to <BR>
compare against Apache running on a Unix platform such as <BR>
Solaris, FreeBSD, or Linux.<BR>
<BR>
The Win32 code for Apache 2.0 has been entirely revised and large <BR>
segments have been rewritten from scratch.  Once the Apache 2.0 <BR>
server is released, we strongly encourage all Win32 users to move to <BR>
that platform for increased stability and security.<BR>
