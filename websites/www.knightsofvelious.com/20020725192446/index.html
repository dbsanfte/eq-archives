<h1>The History of Knights of Velious</h1>
Below is a short history of the Knights of Velious with some of the pictures removed from the
Tavern during the move.
<p>

All facts a fictional, so bear with me.
<p>

<h2>The beginning</h2>
<img src="./img/arch_doc.jpg" align=right>
The Guild and the Dream of the Knights of Velious was formed on
a cloudy day in the earliest of Norraths time. Starlancer put together
a small band of people sharing a dream, and started what since has become
known as the happiest and most kindhearted people in all of Norrath.
The beginning was easy, ideals where shared and the goals accomplished.
Starlancer is no more among us, but his dream lives on. It was during
these time that the original doctrine was written. The doctrine that
today is still our Charter, and our Guideline.
<br clear=all><p>

<h2>Awaking world</h2>
<img src="./img/norrath_map_olde.jpg" align=left>
The times was hard back then. Most of Norrath still
undiscovered and travelling was dangerous. The Knights swore
to keep the lands safe, and, more important, to help each other
survive in a World full of evil forces. The Knights would be
the shinning light that guided all others towards a better
and safer world.
<br clear=all><p>

<h2>Passing the Crown</h2>
<img src="./img/passing_crown.jpg" align=right>
As the World grew older, Starlancer grow old with it and
decided to resign. He passed on the crown to
<span class=help>(who?)</span>, who took it with the
fire that always distinguishes a true Knight from
the common crowd. Under his ruling, the Knights grew
stronger and gained recognition in the world.

<h1>The Tavern</h1>
The Tavern has always been where the Knights met to discuss the
future and brag about the past. It has changed over the years,
but always been a home for the Knights to rest and regain
strength before continuing on our Quests.
<p>
<img src="./img/tavern_old.jpg" align=right>
The first Tavern was a simple house. Made to meet and share stories.
Many a night, people has told of their victories and defeats.
It was also in the Tavern that plans were being made for the
next daring attempt on a dungeon or evil nest of monsters that
needed to be forced back into hidding. The old Tavern served well
many years, but eventually it grew too small and the Knights
build a new house for the Guild.
<br clear=all>
<img src="./img/tavern.jpg" align=left>
The new Tavern was much larger and held room for everyone,
a better kitchen, common room with space enough for the 
entire guild to meet and stables, rooms etc. The new Tavern
also had a permanent Host, Grumm, who kept peace and served
the best brew known to all of Norrath.

<h2>Lady Zarria and Lord Humakt Truesword</h2>
<img src="./img/wedding_zandh.jpg" align=right>
Lady Zarria gave her heart to Lord Humakt Truesword
on a bright sunny day in the fall in Lake Rathe.
They met during a fight against the viscious Orcs
in High Hold and has since then travelled to almost
every corner of Norrath. Today they live with their
cat Yinkinh in
<a href="http://truesword.com">House Truesword</a>,
a castle filled
with joy, laugther and riches donated to their new
cause - helping the next generation of warriors
along to fight the Evil that still persists.
