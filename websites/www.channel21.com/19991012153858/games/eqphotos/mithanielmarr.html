  <p>The following photos have been submitted from those playing on the Mithaniel Marr server.</p>

  <P ALIGN=center><font size="4" color="#cc0000">Kayle</font><font size="4"> - 
    Half-Elf Ranger - <a href="kayle.jpg">PHOTO</a></font><br>
    Poor Kayle, as well as having a red-eyes mutation, and his fingers permanently 
    jammed into one position, he's also been a little unlucky in EQ! Here's what 
    he has to say - &quot;I'm currently working on a new book entitled: 101 Uses 
    for the /corpse Command!&quot; Ah well, at least he seems cheerful about it, 
    despite the odds....</p>
  <P ALIGN=center><font size="4" color="#cc0000">Kuzushi </font><font size="4">- 
    Enchanter - <a href="kuzushi.jpg">PHOTO</a></font><br>
    <font size="3">Wow, Kuzushi has got it made! Not only does he get to wear 
    a funky hat every day, he also practices several martial arts and runs a highly 
    successful espresso-syrup-making company! Money, style, and hard as nails! 
    In game, he describes himself as this!: &quot;a basically fun-loving enchanter 
    that prefers more to spend his time casting levitate on the newbies in freeport 
    than to be out leveling...&quot; - a man after my own heart, I'd marry him, 
    but a) I'm a bloke, and b), er, actually forget I ever said the marrying thing, 
    er, bit stupid now I look back at it, sorry.</font></p>
  <P ALIGN=center><font size="4" color="#cc0000">LefGrebo</font><font size="4"> 
    - Barbarian Warrior - <a href="lefgrebo.jpg">PHOTO</a></font><br>
    <font size="3">LefGrebo says the following: &quot;This is a picture of me 
    in my armor. that's right, real live steel plate and chain. In my spare time 
    I am the president (i.e. emperor) of a national live steel medieval re-creation 
    society, The Adrian Empire Inc. We hold tournaments and events all over the 
    USA. You can find out more info at this web site: <a href="http://www.adrianempire.org">www.adrianempire.org</a>&quot; 
    That'll be 50 dollars for advertising please.</font> </p>
  <P ALIGN=center><font size="4" color="#cc0000">Phoenixx</font><font size="4"> 
    and <font color="#cc0000">Susprinna</font> - Half-Elf Ranger and Dark Elf 
    Shadow Knight - <a href="phoenixx.jpg">PHOTO</a><br>
    <font size="3">Rather bizzarely, Phoenixx has sent in a photo of both himself 
    and Susprinna, when Susprinna has already sent a photo of herself in below 
    - don't these people ever talk to eachother? ;-). He asks me to say - &quot;For 
    those who wonder what's on the other side of the screen :) &quot;Fear not 
    what you see, fear the things you can't &quot; </font></font>&quot; OOooOOooOOoohh</p>
  <P ALIGN=center><FONT COLOR="#cc0000" SIZE="4">Silalumenn<FONT COLOR="#000000"> 
    - Wood Elf Ranger - <A HREF="silalumenn.jpg">PHOTO</A> - <A HREF="silalumennshot.jpg">SCREENSHOT</A><BR>
    also <FONT COLOR="#cc0000">Maleph<FONT COLOR="#000000"> - Dark Elf Necromancer<BR>
    also <FONT COLOR="#cc0000">Tarie<FONT COLOR="#000000"> - High Elf Wizard<BR>
    <FONT SIZE="3">Silalumenn has the following to say: "The picture, well...this 
    is about as brave as I'm gonna get when it comes to showing off my mug to 
    the Everquesting world! :-)". Nice. </FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></p>


<P ALIGN=center><FONT COLOR="#cc0000" SIZE="4">Rykken the Bold<FONT COLOR="#000000"> - Barbarian Warrior - <A HREF="rykken.jpg">PHOTO1</A> - <A HREF="rykken2.jpg">PHOTO2</a> - <A HREF="rykken3.jpg">PHOTO3</a><BR>
<FONT SIZE="2">aka <FONT COLOR="#cc0000">Gorker<FONT COLOR="#000000"> - <A HREF="ralloszek.html">Rallos Zek server</A><BR>
<FONT SIZE="3">Rykken is an armourer and a swordsman in real life! He owns <A HREF="http://www.armourstore.com">The Armour Store</A> in San Diego, CA, so obviously EQ is a hit with him! He sent me so many photos I didn't know what to do with myself!  So I chose three, and you'll have to make do with that... </FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<p align=center><font COLOR="#cc0000" size="4">Uinr <FONT color="#000000">- Dark Elf Enchanter - <A HREF="uinr.jpg">PHOTO1</A> - <A HREF="uinr2.jpg">PHOTO2</a><BR></font></font>
<FONT SIZE=2>aka <font COLOR="#cc0000">Arallock <FONT color="#000000">- <A HREF="fenninro.html">Fennin Ro server</A><BR>
<font size="3">Uinr explains that the photo is him showing his friends just how little sleep he got the night before (although he hastily adds this was due to playing EQ, therefore ruining my punchline).<BR>
Updated!  Uinr has sent in a new photo, and would like me to add the following - Photo1 = before EQ, Photo2 = after EQ - I am, as ever, your humble servant!</font></font></font></font></p>

<P ALIGN=center><FONT COLOR="#cc0000" SIZE="4">Saidan Soulblade<FONT COLOR="#000000"> - Human Paladin - <A HREF="saidan.jpg">PHOTO1</A> - <A HREF="saidan2.jpg">PHOTO2</a> - <A HREF="saidan3.jpg">PHOTO3</A><BR>
<FONT SIZE="3">Saidan has given himself the title "slayer of !Lady Vox" - go to <A HREF="http://www.brick.net/~meyerjs/SlayingOfVox">http://www.brick.net/~meyerjs/SlayingOfVox</A> to see his account of this fantastic deed!</FONT></FONT></FONT></p>

<P ALIGN=center><FONT COLOR="#cc0000" SIZE="4">Amithraril Elendili<FONT COLOR="#000000"> - High Elf Paladin - <A HREF="amithraril.jpg">PHOTO</a><BR>
<FONT SIZE="3">Amithraril says the following - "Halloween 1998 pix - one of my favorite Ren outfits".  Eh?  Still, lovely pair of legs... :-)</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=center><FONT COLOR="#cc0000" SIZE="4">Martyn<FONT COLOR="#000000"> - Bard - <A HREF="martyn.jpg">PHOTO</A><BR>
<FONT SIZE="3">Martyn - solitary, alone, but smiley.  Must be thinking up some rude lyrics for his latest tune.</FONT></FONT></FONT></p>

<P ALIGN=center><FONT COLOR="#cc0000" SIZE="4">Draugr variants<FONT COLOR="#000000"> - Gnome Warrior/Dark Elf Enchanter - <A HREF="draugr.jpg">PHOTO1</A> - <A HREF="draugr2.jpg">PHOTO2</A><BR>
<FONT SIZE="3">Draugr describes himself as "Race/Class Fluctuative", and gave me a choice of photos to put up.  Although "casual" was my main choice, I just couldn't resist him looking all tough and manly in his football gear - ooh, it's enough to make me bat for the other side!<BR>
<FONT SIZE="1">Ahem, sorry, better now</FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=center><FONT COLOR="#cc0000" SIZE="4">Klendathu<FONT COLOR="#000000"> - Gnome Necromancer - <A HREF="klendathu.jpg">PHOTO</a><BR>
<FONT SIZE=3>Klendathu has sent us a photo of what he does in his spare time - is it knitting? cross country running? Cross-stitch?  No, it's putting on armour and hitting people with swords - hooray!  He is the one with the hair and the cape.</font></font></font></p>

<P ALIGN=center><FONT COLOR="#cc0000" SIZE="4">Susprinna<FONT COLOR="#000000"> - Dark Elf Shadow Knight - <A HREF="susprinna.jpg">PHOTO</A><BR>
<FONT SIZE=3>What is it with these dark elves! They're so shy of the personal details! Dear oh dear, we'll have to gaze upon her photo, and gather what we can - it ain't much, but it's all we got :-)</font></font></font></p>

<p align=center><font COLOR="#cc0000" size="4">Delggath<font color="#000000"> - Wood Elf Druid - <A HREF="delggath.jpg">PHOTO</A> - <A HREF="delggathshot.jpg">SCREENSHOT</A>
<BR><font size=3>Delggath looking well 'ard in his screenshot, and toffed up to the nines in his photo.  Posh and aloof? Not at all, Delggath spends much of his time in Freeport, helping those who are rabid or in need of heals.  What a sweetheart.</font></font></font></p>

<P ALIGN=center><FONT COLOR="#cc0000" size="4">Raindrop <FONT COLOR="#000000">- Ranger - <A HREF="raindrop.jpg">PHOTO</a><br>
<font size="3">Raindrop is shown here reclining in her boudoir, I think the army of male slaves are just out of shot...</font></font></font></p>

<p align=center><font color="#cc0000" size="4">Garrik le Jackal <font color="#000000">- 
  Half Elf Rogue - <a href="garrik.jpg">PHOTO</a><br>
  <font size="3">Garrik describes himself as &quot;the scourge of alt.games.everquest&quot;   as his real life alter-ego Rob Illing, and since he lists kung fu and fencing among his interests, you'd better not mess! He brings special attention to his dress sense, as I'm sure you can see from the delightful purple shirt/yellow tie combination in this photo, lovely.</font></font></font></p>
