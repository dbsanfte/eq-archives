  <p><font size="7">Tunare Server Photos!</font></p>
  <p>The following photos have been submitted from those playing on the Tunare server.</p>

  <P ALIGN=center><font size="1">*new today!*</font><font size="4" color="#cc0000">Jotun 
    Bashur </font><font size="4">- Troll Warrior - <a href="jotun.jpg">PHOTO</a></font><br>
    <font size="3">With words more eloquent than I could ever produce, Jotun pens 
    his own statement - &quot;Jotun big troggie! Frum da cold lands of Norway 
    wer da trolls actually do come from.&quot; I couldn't have put it better myself..!</font></p>
  <P ALIGN=center><font size="4" color="#cc0000">Hazy </font><font size="4">- 
    Barbarian Shaman - <a href="hazy.jpg">PHOTO</a> - <a href="hazyshot.jpg">SCREENSHOT</a></font><br>
    <font size="3">In an oddly reminiscent style of Freaker below, Hazy lists 
    her likes as &quot;Wearing a Bearhead; Curling up with a good book; Breaking 
    the skulls of my enemies and dancing upon them&quot;, and her dislikes as 
    &quot;Respawning at night; Certain kinds of cheeses; Trains; Having my skull 
    broken and danced upon&quot;. That's nice, I spot a conspiracy here, although 
    they have different e-mails, I suspect they may inhabit at least the same 
    office...</font></p>
  <P ALIGN=center><font size="4" color="#cc0000">Freaker</font><font size="4"> 
    - Half-Elf Ranger - <a href="freaker.jpg">PHOTO</a></font><br>
    <font size="3">Freaker lists his turn ons as &quot;music, art, adventure, 
    and moonlit strolls along the bloody shores of broken enemy bodies&quot;, 
    and his turn offs as &quot;rain, poor personal hygiene, loot bogarts/campers, 
    and death (specifically my own)&quot;. Lovely fella.</font></p>
  <P ALIGN=center><font size="4" color="#cc0000">Than Al'Hazred</font><font size="4"> 
    - Tier'Dal Necromancer - <a href="than.jpg">PHOTO</a></font><br>
    <font size="3">Again, I'm left with not much info here. Well, ok, none at 
    all. So we'll instead have to look at Than's photo and admire his gleaming 
    locks as a substitute, lovely.</font> </p>
  <P ALIGN=center><font size="4" color="#cc0000">Gintala</font><font size="4"> 
    - Gnome Wizard - <a href="gintala.jpg">PHOTO</a></font><br>
    <font size="3">Gintala says this: &quot;Most people say I look scary so I 
    guess it helps my characters intimidation factor out a little to send a picture 
    of me. Lets face it gnomes arent very scary lookin&quot;. Ooh, I don't know, 
    I often tremble in fear at the sight of a two-foot fella in a dress, wooOOooOOooh. 
    Or, alternatively, not. </font></p>
  <P ALIGN=center><FONT COLOR="#cc0000" size="4">Halaster <FONT COLOR="#000000">- 
    Wizard - <A HREF="halaster.jpg">PHOTO</A><BR>
    <FONT SIZE="3">Halaster describes himself as an "Unsane Wizard", and adds 
    the following puzzling statement - "rebirth through fire". I see. From the 
    look of his photo, the poor dear's a little confused, there there.</font></font></font></p>
  <P ALIGN=center><FONT COLOR="#cc0000" size="4">Epitome <FONT COLOR="#000000">- Dwarf Cleric - <A HREF="epitome.jpg">PHOTO</A><BR>
<FONT SIZE="3">Epitome states that other than being stocky, he does not look like a dwarf, although he has the nose for it.  And no, he is not stoned in that picture (the thought!)  He can be found outside Crushbone - heals and buffs for all!</font></font></font></P>

<P ALIGN=center><FONT COLOR="#cc0000" SIZE="4">Drakk Maelstrom<FONT COLOR="#000000"> - Dwarven Paladin - <A HREF="drakk.jpg">PHOTO</A><BR>
<FONT SIZE="3">Drakk adds these inspiring words to accompany his visage - "I must retreat from real life into the Everquest world often, for I am shunned by my peers for my unusual hobbies" - indeedly doodly!</font></font></font></p>

<P ALIGN=center><FONT COLOR="#cc0000" SIZE="4">Noor<font color="#000000"> - Half-Elf Druid - <A HREF="noor.jpg">PHOTO</A> - <A HREF="noorshot.jpg">SCREENSHOT</A>
<BR><font size=3>Noor describes herself as a "typical goodie two-shoes druid, who likes to help out", which explains why the screenshot displays her in her most common position - dead :-)</font></font></font></p>

<p align=center><font COLOR="#cc0000" size="4">Mandonnagon<font color="#000000"> - Wood Elf Ranger - <A HREF="mandonnagon.gif">PHOTO</A></font></font><BR>
also <font COLOR="#cc0000" size="4">Milenne<FONT COLOR="#000000"> - Barbarian Warrior</font></font><BR>
also <FONT COLOR="#cc0000" size="4">Zarine<FONT COLOR="#000000"> - Half Elf Bard 	<BR>
<font size=3>Mandonnagon is shown here being all "at one with nature", I'm sure he should have a druid. (grin).</font></font></font></p>

<p align=center><font color="#cc0000" size="4">Tarne <font color="#000000">- Dark Elf Warrior - <A HREF="tarne.jpg">PHOTO</a><br>
<font size="3">Tarne, in typical Dark Elf style, is reserved in giving personal details, so instead, we'll have to draw our own conclusions from his photo.	Too much everquest, not enough tidying? ;-)</font></font></font></p>
