  <p><font size="7">Xegony Server Photos!</font></p>
  <p>The following photos have been submitted from those playing on the Xegony server.</p>

  <P ALIGN=center><font size="1">*new today!*</font><font size="4" color="#cc0000">Kenuvan 
    Shadowstalker</font><font size="4"> - Wood Elf Rogue - <a href="kenuvan.jpg">PHOTO</a> 
    - <a href="kenuvanshot.jpg">SCREENSHOT</a></font><br>
    <font size="3">You'll have to excuse me including the full screenshot here, 
    but 1) it shows rogue skills actually BEING used, and er, oh, that's it. Sigh. 
    (p.s. techies amongst the audience will notice that Kenuvan has a life-sized 
    linux doll behind him, oh the shame ;-)</font></p>
  <P ALIGN=center><font size="4" color="#cc0000">Wolfdor</font><font size="4"> 
    - Barbarian Warrior - <a href="wolfdor.jpg">PHOTO</a></font><br>
    <font size="3">Wolfdor is a member of Clan MacLear, and says &quot;I like 
    to knockout bixies!!&quot;. Really. Um, unless bixies is a word I'm not aware 
    of for young ladies (see photo), or I'm not up on some everquest term, I've 
    no idea what he's talking about! Hooray!</font></p>
  <P ALIGN=center><font size="1"><font size="4" color="#cc0000">Jael</font><font size="4"> 
    - Half Elf Ranger - <a href="jael.jpg">PHOTO</a> - <a href="jaelshot.jpg">SCREENSHOT</a><br>
    <font size="3">I'm guessing that Jael is the little boy in this photo, why 
    you can almost see it in his eyes... and ooh, what a pretty screenshot! Prize 
    for being the most sparkly to you Jael!</font></font></font></p>
  <P ALIGN=center><FONT COLOR="#cc0000" SIZE="4">Lemien<FONT COLOR="#000000"> 
    - Wood Elf Druid - <A HREF="lemien.jpg">PHOTO</A><BR>
    <FONT SIZE="3">Lemien is shown here next to a nifty yellow motor, and he's 
    only 21. Bastard, I hate you with a passion you can only begin to imagine... 
    (grin)</FONT></FONT></FONT></p>

<P ALIGN=center><FONT COLOR="#cc0000" SIZE="4">Tandor<FONT COLOR="#000000"> - Wood Elf Druid - <A HREF="tandor.jpg">PHOTO</A><BR>
<FONT SIZE="3">Tandor claims to be "the coolest	druid in all of Norrath", however, he apologises for the poor quality of his photograph, which he apparently captured by holding a photograph up to a Quickcam - not cool. ha. ;-)</FONT></FONT></FONT></p>

<P ALIGN=center><FONT COLOr="#cc0000" SIZE="4">Mahfouz Ripmaster(pending)<FONT COLOR="#000000"> - Human Monk - <A HREF="mahfouz.gif">PHOTO</A><BR>
<FONT SIZE="3">Mahfouz has the following to say: "some of my accomplishments:<UL><LI>singlehandedly discovered the feigh death luring tatic for monks
<LI>singlehandedly proved there is no sea monster lurking underneath lake rathtear
<LI>singlehandedly conducted a 10 minute conversation with a guide in a friend-like manner
<LI>singlehandedly am scientifically proven to be the best man on earth. no bones about it.</UL>
No arguments from me!</FONT></FONT></FONT><p></p>

<P ALIGN=center><FONT COLOR="#cc0000" SIZE="4">Tulvaran Mithrilbow<FONT COLOR="#000000"> - Half Elf Ranger - <A HREF="tulvaran.jpg">PHOTO</A> - <A HREF="tulvaranshot.jpg">SCREENSHOT1</A> - <A HREF="tulvaranshot2.jpg">SCREENSHOT2</A><BR>
<FONT SIZE="3">Tulvaran says that he likes playing/watching sports (in which he includes everquest...) and is apparently "A HOKIE!!!". er, ok then... On the other hand, how cool does he look in screenshot1!  He claims someone slipped something in his drink in screenshot2...</font></font></font></p> 

<P ALIGN=center><FONT COLOR="#cc0000" SIZE="4">Wrynn<FONT COLOR="#000000"> - Wood Elf Warrior - <A HREF="wrynn.jpg">PHOTO</A> - <A HREF="wrynnshot.jpg">SCREENSHOT</a><BR>
<FONT SIZE="3">Wrynn doesn't really add much to put under his photo, so instead we'll just admire his lovely set of armour, and wonder why exactly there is a random arm punching him in his photo...</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=center><FONT COLOR="#cc0000" SIZE="4">Aerion<FONT COLOR="#000000"> - Wood Elf Ranger - <A HREF="aerion.jpg">PHOTO</a><BR>
<FONT SIZE="3">Aerion adds the following to go with his delightful piccy - "Only picture of (just) me in a digital form. It's from the last gig of the last band I was in. Somebody said something about clashing, so I did my best." - Success is yours sir!</font></font></font></P>

<P ALIGN=center><font COLOR="#cc0000" size="4">Fekulus <FONT COLOR="#000000">- Wood Elf Ranger - <A HREF="fekulus.jpg">PHOTO</A><BR>
<font size="3">Fekulus has obviously spent too much time in the Ocean of Tears with the Cyclopes, since he has developed an interesting "third-eye" style mutation.  Nice.</font></font></font><p>

<P ALIGN=center><FONT COLOR="#cc0000" size="4">Bazzack <FONT COLOR="#000000">- Gnome Magician - <A HREF="bazzack.jpg">PHOTO</a><br>
<font size="3">Bazzack is pictured here, holding, er, something... These Gnomes and their contraptions, honestly.<BR><FONT SIZE=1>(addendum, I am reliably informed by several people it is a paintball gun.  Yes, but that spoils my little comment, doesn't it, tsk)</font></font></font></font></p>

<p align=center><font size=4 color="#cc0000">Jeffryn of Surefall<FONT COLOR="#000000">- <A HREF="wuming.jpg">PHOTO</A><br>
<FONT COLOR="#cc0000">Wuming of Freeport<font COLOR="#000000"> <br>
<FONT SIZE="2">aka <font color="#cc0000">Fenwick of Qeynos<font COLOR="000000"> - <A HREF="quellious.html">Quellious server</A>
<BR><font size=3>All three personas are known as DuskRunner on the newsgroup alt.games.everquest, shown here looting a treasure chamber in Singapore - the backpack is apparently a ten-slotter...</font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></p>
