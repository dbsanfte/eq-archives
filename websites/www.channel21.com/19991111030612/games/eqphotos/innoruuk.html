  <p>The following photos have been submitted from those playing on the Innoruuk server.</p>

  <P ALIGN=center><font size="1">*new today!*</font><font size="4" color="#cc0000">Kanyon</font><font size="4"> 
    - Human Shadow Knight - <a href="kanyon.jpg">PHOTO</a></font><br>
    <font size="3">Kanyon would like me to add the following caption: "Who's better 
    then Kanyon?" "Nobody!" "The almight derv slayer in the flesh". Sir, it is 
    done! And it appears from the photo that someone's discovered the wonders 
    of photoshop filters...</font> </P>
  <P ALIGN=center><FONT SIZE="4" COLOR="#cc0000">Jobin<FONT COLOR="#000000"> - 
    Dwarf Cleric - <A HREF="jobin.jpg">PHOTO</A><BR>
    <FONT SIZE="3">Mysteriously, Jobin appears to have utilised a store security 
    camera for his photo, whether he was employed by, or was just robbing the 
    store, we'll never know... </FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=center><FONT SIZE="4" COLOR="#cc0000">Shayye Mawr<FONT COLOR="#000000"> - Wood Elf Druid - <A HREF="shayye.jpg">PHOTO</A><BR>
<FONT SIZE="3">Lady Shayye Mawr has apparently been a member of the BurningHeart Guild for several years now, which is nice, although I wonder if in the photo, she's noticed that there appears to be something stuck to her hand... don't worry, if you give it a good wash with swarfega, it'll probably come off with time.</FONT></FONT></FONT></p>
