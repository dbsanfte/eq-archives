  <p>The following photos have been submitted from those playing on the Bristlebane 
    server.</p>

  <P ALIGN=center><font size="1">*new today!*</font><font size="4" color="#cc0000">Kiksalu</font><font size="4"> 
    - Enchantress -<a href="kiksalu.jpg"> PHOTO</a></font><br>
    <font size="3">Kiksalu says the following - &quot;I'm extremely reclusive 
    but I intend to make the trip from Canada down to Baltimore for the gathering, 
    these are the only events that can lure me from my comp.&quot; - fantastic! 
    EQ brings people together! Hooray for Verant! Hooray for Kiksalu! Hooray for, 
    er, everything!</font></p>
  <P ALIGN=center><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#cc0000">"Sir" Thelion<FONT COLOR="#000000"> 
    - Human Paladin - <A HREF="thelion.jpg">PHOTO</A> - <A HREF="thelionshot.gif">SCREENSHOT</A><BR>
    <FONT SIZE="3">Sir Thelion says that he is well known in the areas surrounding 
    freeport, especially to the guards, to whom he is apparently KOS (kill-on-sight)! 
    He signs his message Sir Thelion of the Knights of Truth, and is shown here 
    resplendant in his bronze armour. Lovely!</FONT></FONT></FONT></p>

<P ALIGN=center><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#cc0000">Vven<FONT COLOR="#000000"> - Barbarian Warrior - <A HREF="vven.jpg">PHOTO</A> - <A HREF="vvenshot.jpg">SCREENSHOT</A><BR>
<FONT SIZE="3">Vven says that his photo is him feeling the after-effects of a day trooping in the great Canadian Wilderness, poor baby. Apparently his main everquest goal is to be known as "Vven the Ultimate Warrior!!!".  Not without some warrior fixes ;-)</font></font></font></p>

<p align=center><font size=4><font color="#cc0000">CyberKnight</font> - High Elf Magician - <A HREF="cyberknight.jpg">PHOTO</a></font>
