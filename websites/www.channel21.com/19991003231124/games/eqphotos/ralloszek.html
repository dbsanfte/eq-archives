  <p>The following photos have been submitted from those playing on the Rallos Zek server.</p>

    <font size="3">Wow, these guys are writing it for me! Nothing to say, over 
    to you Rajun! &quot;Here I am, acting like I am working while I cruise the 
    Everquest message board sites on the internet. Sometimes milking is harder 
    than the actual work itself. Notice my neat blue Nomex "smurf" suit, which 
    keeps me safe in the comfy environs of a oil refinery. Here are the stats 
    on my Nomex jumpsuit: </font></p>

  <P ALIGN=center><font size="4" color="#cc0000">Adias Silverleaf</font><font size="4"> 
    - Wood Elf Druid - <a href="adias.jpg">PHOTO</a></font><br>
    <font size="3">Adias says this - &quot;A very friendly and helpful druid who 
    does his best to be friends with everyone. Quiet and humble is his way providing 
    buffs, heals, and cures as needed.&quot;. Aaah, bless 'im, what a sweetie. 
    Suspicious as I am, I spy a future dictator of the world in the making....</font></p>
  <P ALIGN=center><FONT COLOR="#cc0000" SIZE="4">KaLourin<FONT COLOR="#000000">

    server</a><BR>
    <FONT SIZE="3">KaLourin is shown here in two of his most common guises. By 
    day he disguises himself as a lunatic, and is kept locked up in "bizzaro towers", 
    but at night, he escapes, and becomes sophisticated man of the night, selling 
    his services to the highest bidder, oo-er.</FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></p>
  <P ALIGN=center><FONT COLOR="#cc0000" SIZE="4">Gorker<FONT COLOR="#000000"> - Troll Shaman - <A HREF="rykken.jpg">PHOTO1</A> - <A HREF="rykken2.jpg">PHOTO2</A> - <A HREF="rykken3.jpg">PHOTO3</A><BR>
<FONT SIZE="2">aka <FONT COLOR="#cc0000">Rykken<FONT COLOR="000000"> - <A HREF="mithanielmarr.html">Mithaniel Marr server</A><BR>
<FONT SIZE="3">As you can see from Gorker's photo's, he's a real life knight!  As the owner of San Diego's <A HREF="http://www.armourstore.com">The Armour Store</A>, he can have as much armour, and as many swords as he wishes.  You lucky, lucky bastard.</font></font></font></font></font></font></P>

<P ALIGN=center><FONT COLOR="#cc0000" SIZE="4">Aarodor<FONT COLOR="#000000"> - Human Druid - <A HREF="aarodor.jpg">PHOTO</A><BR>

<FONT SIZE=2>aka <FONT COLOR="#cc0000">Flay<FONT COLOR="#000000"> - <A HREF="prexus.html">Prexus server</A><BR>
<FONT SIZE="3">Aarodor has been playing everquest since the day it was released and is still trying to find a way to play it at work.  Shown here only slightly more naked than Cateyes, it looks like they have a whole lotta fun!</FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></p>

<P ALIGN=center><FONT COLOR="#cc0000" SIZE="4">Cateyes Stormcaller<FONT COLOR="#000000"> - Half-Elf Druid - <A HREF="cateyes.jpg">PHOTO</A><BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>aka <FONT COLOR="#cc0000">Caat<FONT COLOR="#000000"> - <A HREF="prexus.html">Prexus server</A><BR>
<FONT SIZE="3">Cateyes was hooked on everquest by her boyfriend (see Aarodor above) shortly after its release, probably to save himself all the hassle cause by HUGE amounts of time spent playing it!  In real life she's a personal trainer, and spends her days whipping people into shape - ooer!  This photo is apparently one that Aarodor thought was "appropriate".  Mmn.</font></font></font></font></font></font></p>

<P ALIGN=center><FONT COLOR="#cc0000" SIZE="4">Xandramas<FONT COLOR="#000000"> - Half-Elf Druid - <A HREF="xandramas.jpg">PHOTO</A><BR>
<FONT SIZE="3">Xandramas has sent in a photo of himself relaxing in a tropical pool somewhere with his father, bless im.  Oy, Xandramas, look at yer dad's tan - where's yours?!</FONT></FONT></FONT></p>

<P ALIGN=center><FONT COLOR="#cc0000" SIZE="4">Amano Jyaku<FONT COLOR="#000000"> - Monk - <A HREF="amano.gif">PHOTO</A><BR>
<FONT SIZE="3">Amano is a member of the Ashen Order. He has the following to say - "This photo was taken a week or so after somebody convinced me to shave the beard off.. what a mistake! hence, the five o'clock shadow. The beard is back now. ;)"</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT SIZE="3">Stiles describes himself as "a disgruntled druid", and obviously consoles himself with his truck.  I omitted the single picture of his brothers truck, because, well, there's only so much truck I can take ;-)</font></font></font></p>

<P ALIGN=center><FONT COLOR="#cc0000" SIZE="4">Chance Nifield<FONT COLOR="#000000"> - High Elf Enchanter - <A HREF="chance.jpg">PHOTO</A><BR>
<FONT SIZE="3">Chance is "the guildmaster of the <A HREF="http://www.knightsofterror.com">Knights of Terror</A>. (Best PK guild on Rallos Zek)", and apparently likes to PK for fun.  He would like me to add the words "Its your world, we just control it." - your wish is my command, Mr Nifield!</font></font></font></P>

<p align=center><font COLOR="#cc0000" size="4">Nuviena<font color="#000000"> - Wood Elf Ranger - <A HREF="nuviena.jpg">PHOTO</A>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3>Nuviena is shown here on the left, looking mildly tipsy to say the least. I'm shocked personally, honest.</font></font></font></p>
