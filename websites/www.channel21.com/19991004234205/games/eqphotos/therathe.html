  <p>The following photos have been submitted from those playing on the "The Rathe" server.</p>

  <P ALIGN=center><font size="1">*new today!*</font><font size="4" color="#cc0000">Karas</font><font size="4"> 
    -<a href="karas.jpg"> PHOTO</a></font><br>
    <font size="3">Karas is Guild Master of the <a href="http://members.tripod.com/Katinka_CoN">Champions 
    of Norrath</a> - one of the first guilds in Norrath, who are apparently allied 
    with the Many Fine Heroes (MFH) guild. He is married in-game to Katinka, and 
    in real life is a single father-to-be, living in Langhorne PA. Complicated 
    life! He says he's never too busy to talk online - he'll regret saying that!</font></p>
  <P ALIGN=center><FONT COLOR="#cc0000" SIZE="4">Cymoril<FONT COLOR="#000000"> 
    - Wood Elf Ranger - <A HREF="cymoril.jpg">PHOTO</A><BR>
    <FONT SIZE="3">Cymoril is a member of the Tindi'Losi guild, and has the following 
    to say: "don't mess with me...I have friends in lower places than you do :)". 
    Power to the people! And may I say what a <I>lovely</I> bow tie you have on...</font></font></font></p>


<P ALIGN=center><FONT COLOR="#cc0000" SIZE="4">Alessandro<FONT COLOR="#000000"> - Human Bard - <A HREF="alessandro.jpg">PHOTO</A> - <A HREF="alessandroshot.jpg">SCREENSHOT</A><BR>
<FONT SIZE="3">Alessandro pictured here reclining upon one of the many hedges in his enormous garden at the back of his gigantic mansion.  I expect.</font></font></font></p>

<p align=center><font COLOR="#cc0000" size="4">Khistrich McAvoy<font color="#000000"> - Barbarian Warrior - <A HREF="khistrich.jpg">PHOTO</A>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3>Khistrich gives me little info to go on, and from his mysterious portrait, we can only conclude that he got someone else to write it for him.  Well, bit simple these barbarians ;-)</font></font></font></p>
