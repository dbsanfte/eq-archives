    Elbereth</font><font size="4"> - Wizard -<a href="tarsuril.jpg"> PHOTO</a></font><br>
    <font size="3">When Tarsuril isn't in the land of Norrath, he says he's pulling 
    wrenches on his 1986 Mustang... it's odd, but the photo he's sent in of his 
    car is bigger than that of himself! People and their cars! sheesh!</font></p>
  <P ALIGN=center><FONT COLOR="#cc0000" SIZE="4">Janos and Aanilae Lyn'Dal <FONT COLOR="#000000">- 
    Half-Elf Rogue / Dark Elf Cleric - <A HREF="janos.jpg">PHOTO(Janos)</A> - 
    PHOTO(Aanilae)<BR>
    <FONT SIZE="3">Ah bless, Janos specially requested to be put up together with 
    his girlfriend, although mysteriously, they are in different photographs. 
    Mmn, call me suspicious, but I may have put this bloke up randomly with some 
    woman he's just picked out of the blue... ;-)<BR>
    UPDATE - Goddamit! Aanilae has mailed me, and said that you pathetic losers 
    out there have hit on her SO MUCH since this was posted, can she have her 
    photo removed! She didn't put it up to be hit on, she's ON WITH HER BOYFRIEND! 
    Grow up children! You've lost me a photo!</font></font></font></p>
