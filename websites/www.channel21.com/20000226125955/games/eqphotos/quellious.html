  <p>The following photos have been submitted from those playing on the Quellious server.</p>

  <P ALIGN=center><font size="4" color="#cc0000">Silikon</font><font size="4"> 
    - Human Warrior -<a href="silikon.jpg"> PHOTO</a></font><font size="3"><br>
    Silikon doesn't give me any extra info, but hey, who the heck needs info when 
    we can admire his +20 CHA glowing D&amp;B sweatshirt (effect of a greater 
    lightstone)- they'll be camping round his house for this rare spawn!</font></p>
  <P ALIGN=center><font size="4" color="#cc0000">Uthriel</font><font size="4"> 
    - High Elf Magician - <a href="uthriel.jpg">PHOTO</a> - <a href="uthrielshot.jpg">SCREENSHOT</a></font><font size="3"><br>
    Uthriel says that the character &quot;is only about a week old, but he is 
    already lvl 8 ... and i have a full time job, a wife (she sleeps at night 
    like a normal person...) and a little girl.. Uthriel is well known for traveling 
    to freeport just to die, then spending the next hour retrieving his items.....stubborn 
    elf..doesnt want to be bound to freeport....&quot; There you go. The photo 
    is from his marine corps days, although it doesn't look <i>particularly </i>marine 
    to me... (and don't ask me why the screenshot has a different name, I don't 
    know (grin)).</font></p>

    <FONT SIZE="3">Jubei is shown here in two of his most common guises. By day 
    he disguises himself as a lunatic, and is kept locked up in "bizzaro towers", 
    but at night, he escapes, and becomes sophisticated man of the night, selling 
    his services to the highest bidder, oo-er.</FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></p>

<FONT SIZE="3">Ganthalas is from Frankfurt, Germany, and this is his favourite pic!  The thing is, I'm almost certain he sent me another message with loads more info on it, but er, well, the image was so large, it kind of crashed my mailbox, and I lost it all.
