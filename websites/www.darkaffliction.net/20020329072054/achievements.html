<p align="center"><font size="5">The Fierce, Ferocious Clockwork Dragon has
emerged! The Mad Scientist taunted us and called us cowards. Fight my&nbsp; pet!
Fight him!! So we did.....and slaughtered it like the weak creation it was. Dark
Affliction and an ally member has slain the Great Clockwork Dragon today! (GM
event) The&nbsp; irony being as soon as we slay him and looted him, along came
Von....What a nice guy he is to pay&nbsp; us a visit. Anyways Thanks to Edea,
Xova, Riklaunim, Squiish, Tevahn, Gukum, Zsuzsana, and Wessley&nbsp; the dragon
took a spankin. Looted 150 p, Abolone Gorget, Sleeves of the Kelpmaiden, and
Mithril Vambracers! Congrats!! Victory!!</font></p>
