    <dt><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">&nbsp;</font> Dark Affliction is an 
    evil guild on the Firiona Vie server, even as such Dark Affliction expects 
    its members to behave in a respectable manner. </dt>
  </div>
  <div align="left">
    <dt><br>
     While many aspire to the conquest of great beasts or the acquisition of 
    vast wealth, Dark Affliction is devoted above ALL else to developing and 
    encouraging good play and camaraderie in its members. </dt>
  </div>
  <div align="left">
    <dt><br>
     Dark Affliction guild members seek always to lead by example, and to 
    demonstrate fairness and generosity at all times. Selfish and dishonorable 
    conduct such as intentional training, kill stealing, harassment, ninja 
    looting, or deceitful trading will not be tolerated. <br>
     Roleplaying is encouraged but not required. <br>
    <br>
    <b>I. CODE OF CONDUCT </b><br>
    Dark Affliction is a guild that strives to set a high standard of honorable 
    behavior. Be aware that you are a representative of our guild and that your 
    actions reflect upon us all. Guild members should seek to treat others with 
    courtesy and respect at all times. Discordant alignment and honorable 
    behavior are not in direct opposition to each other. We expect everyone to 
    behave within the guidelines set below. <br>
    <br>
    Dark Affliction deems the following as unacceptable conduct: <br>
    a) Use of profanity in a public chat mode. (This includes Guild Chat, Say, 
    Shout, Auction, and emotes). </dt>
  </div>
  <div align="left">
    <dt><br>
    b) Harassment of another player, either verbally or in any other way 
    attempting to continually disrupt his game play. </dt>
  </div>
  <div align="left">
    <dt><br>
    c) Begging for cash, items or &quot;power leveling&quot;. (This includes Guild Chat, 
    Say, Shout, Auction, and emotes.) </dt>
  </div>
  <div align="left">
    <dt><br>
    d) (Public) Harassment of other guilds. This includes Say, Shout, Auction, 
    and emotes. </dt>
  </div>
  <div align="left">
    <dt><br>
    e) Kill Stealing. Intentionally trying to kill npc's that are already 
    engaged in combat with another player unless that player asks for your 
    assistance. </dt>
  </div>
  <div align="left">
    <dt><br>
    f) Intentional Training. Intentionally training mobs on other players or 
    groups, even if they are of light races, is not acceptable. </dt>
  </div>
  <div align="left">
    <dt><br>
    g) &quot;Ninja&quot; Looting. Do not loot bodies of fallen monsters unless (1) you 
    were ORIGINALLY awarded credit for the kill by the game (meaning, you were 
    able to loot the body immediately), or (2) the kill has been CLEARLY 
    abandoned. Also, know and abide by your group's loot arrangement (if you do 
    not agree with it, LEAVE). This includes looting while fighting, loot order, 
    and especially the handling of &quot;named&quot;/rare drops. <br>
    <br>
    <u>Note:</u> Any guild member deemed guilty of an offense will receive a 
    warning. Members are allowed two warnings. Additional offenses will be 
    grounds for expulsion from the guild. <br>
    <br>
    <b>II. RECRUITING </b><br>
    We are an Evil Guild, as such we are only recruiting people of an evil 
    alignment. Characters of good alignments will never be allowed in the guild.
    <br>
    <br>
    All NEW members must meet the following minimal requirements: <br>
    a) Must be at least level 30. </dt>
  </div>
  <div align="left">
    <dt><br>
    b) Must be of evil alignment. </dt>
  </div>
  <div align="left">
    <dt><br>
    c) Must know Tier'dal at the level of excellent (90) or higher. </dt>
  </div>
  <div align="left">
    <dt><br>
    d) May not have alts in other guilds. </dt>
  </div>
  <div align="left">
    <dt><br>
    </dt>
  </div>
  <dt>All new members must post on the message board &quot;The Overthere&quot; and 
  announce their intentions to join the guild. This allows us as members to 
  review the incoming membership prior to them being invited into the guild. All 
  memberships applications will be posted at least one week prior to the new 
  member being recruited, this should allow enough time for members to review 
  the applications. Guild members will then post their comments in the 
  &quot;Applications&quot; section of the board and after at least a weeks time, the 
  officership will decide. <br>
  <br>
  <u>Note:</u> Members who have alts and who wish them to join Dark Affliction 
  will have the level limit and language limit temporarily waived, but they will 
  be expected to meet the minimum requirements as soon as possible. <br>
  <br>
  <b>III. GUILD MEETINGS </b><br>
  Guild meeting will be held on the first Saturday of every other month (Febuary, 
  April, June, August, October and December). Exact time and location will be 
  announced two weeks prior to the date of the meeting. <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <b>IV. LOOT </b><br>
  The following rules are in place to assist in the distribution of named/rare 
  drops on guild raids. </dt>
  <dt><br>
  a) Item drops Item drops will go first and foremost to people who are present 
  at the time of the raid/loot roll. Officers or the leader of raid will decide 
  what classes should roll for said item just because its all/all doesn't mean 
  everyone should get to roll. </dt>
  <dt><br>
  b) Rolling - once the classes are decided, then who should roll? Anyone who 
  hasn't been deemed have won their fair share (Almost always one item per raid 
  unless they are the only bard and bard only armor drops) Until everyone else 
  of their class has something before rolling again. Officers (or the leader of 
  raid) will keep track of who won items and who didn't on raids to try to 
  spread out as best as can with a random system as so everyone has a shot at 
  nice stuff, not &quot;this has to go to main tank&quot; and the like. </dt>
  <dt><br>
  c) Extra Items - Items that are Unwanted by the people on the raid will be 
  collected by the officers for later distribution among the guild. </dt>
  <dt><br>
  d) Epics - Epics are totally different everyone should know who gets what 
  before raid begins regarding epic pieces. Whoever closer and 50+ of course 
  gets. </dt>
  <dt><br>
  e) Tracking - Keeping track of loot is a must after raid so other raiders will 
  know who has gotten what items. All loots will be posted by the raid leader or 
  the officer in charge as soon as possible. <br>
  </dt>
