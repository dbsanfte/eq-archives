not be awarded another planes item for a long time (as deemed fit by the
officers) (The officers, warmasters, guild leader will all keep a list of who is
awarded what). Second offense to this is being banned from our guild. We will
not tolerate this type of behavior. If you wish to do this, contact an officer

get and maybe it would be allowed. But know that you would not receive another

This is an evil guild. Only evil beings will be allowed in it. I know that we

work on their factions with neriak, cabilis, grobb, oggok and be able to walk
freely amongst us evils in one of our evil cities if not more and commit evil
acts and will roleplay evil. NO MORE NEUTRALS WILL BE ALLOWED! This is causing
problems so it <u>wont </u>be tolerated. Those who are in, will roleplay evil
and work on their factions as stated above and be EVIL. No one will be accepted
into our family unless they are evil. Period.</i></b></font></p>

you are a current member and wish to remake your character, please talk to an
officer about your options. Its your account and we wont force you to do
anything, but if you make a non evil character, it wont be allowed back in Dark
Affliction. Now if you work on your factions, roleplay evil, commit evil acts
and dont ever group with good, message us and the officers AND members will vote
on this whether they want that character in our EVIL guild. If you remake as an
evil character (hence races like dark elf, troll, ogre, or iksar and classes of
human, gnome, erudite that are deity or class evil defined) we will re tag you,
no questions asked because you are still evil =) Hope this helps straighten out
