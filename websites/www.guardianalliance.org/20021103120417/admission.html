<br><br>
<b>ALTS:</b> A member must have been with the guild at least four weeks before they can have an alt join. The AC will determine any additional policies or restrictions on Alts as needed.
<br><br>

Applicants must be unguilded and have no other alts in another guild on the Zeb Server. Applicants must proactively group with members of Guardian Alliance for a minimum of two weeks prior to approval of the application. All applications are subject to an interview by the Admissions Council.
<br><br>
<b>APPROVAL:</b> After an appropriate amount of time to allow for grouping/raiding with Guardian Alliance, a the facilitator of the interview from the Admissions Council will post a poll for all guild members to vote on the applicant, and the poll is open for 5 days. If accepted, the guild’s officers shall be responsible for inviting the recruit as soon as possible. 
<br><br>
<b>ORIENTATION:</b> The new recruit is subject to a 30 day orientation period. Orientation consist of learning Guardian Alliance’s guild philosophy, group conduct, raid strategies, raid conduct, loot rules, and general expected behavior. At the end of the 30 days, the officers will vote on full member status. The recruit must receive a UNANIMOUS vote by the officers in order to become a full member of Guardian Alliance.
<br><br>
An officer shall not invite a recruit unless the guild has affirmatively voted for admission. The guild leader reserves the right to directly invite a recruit without AC approval. However, the officers and committee chairman must be immediately informed of the reason for bypassing the AC. This should be a rare occurrence used only in extraordinary circumstances.
<br><br>
<b>ANNOUNCEMENTS:</b> Each new member shall be announced by the AC to the guild. The AC shall determine the manner in which this is done.
<br><br>
<b>FORMER MEMBERS:</b> Former members of Guardian Alliance are eligible to return within two weeks, upon a unanimous vote of the guild leader and officers. Former members are to contact the Recruitment Officer for re-admission and determination if re-admission is plausible, based upon past behavior in the guild and terms in which former member left Guardian Alliance. If absence from Guardian Alliance is longer than two weeks, former members must submit a new application and are subject to all rules outlined in this document.
<br><br>
<b>ADMISSIONS COUNCIL:</b> The AC shall be responsible for enforcing this policy. Any item not addressed in the policy may be handled as the AC deems fit.
<br><br>
The AC shall consist of five members – Recruitment Officer, Orientation Officer, and three non-officers. One of the three non-officers shall be the committee chairman as determined by the Recruitment and Orientation Officers. The representative officers will be chosen by the guild leader and serves at the guild leader’s will. The three non-members must be guild members in good standing with a minimum of three months active membership with the guild.
<br><br>
<b>RECRUITMENT OFFICER:</b> The Recruitment Officer is ultimately responsible for admissions to the guild. He/she is the final call on the applicant if the vote is close. He/she is also responsible for delivering the acceptance or decline of an application and full member status, and addressing concerns over the final decision. The Recruitment Officer acts as the liaison between former members of the guild wishing to return and the officers, determines if the former member is eligible for re-entry into Guardian Alliance, and if an officer poll is in order.
<br><br>
<b>ORIENTATION OFFICER:</b> The Orientation Officer is responsible for educating new recruits in the philosophy, rules, and regulations of Guardian Alliance. He/she determines when a recruit is eligible for the higher level/intensive raids based upon behavior in training and past raids. The Orientation Officer must group with each recruit at least twice to observe behavior in normal group settings. He/she shall also take corrective measures if behavior does not meet Guardian Alliance standards, which may include up to dismissal from Guardian Alliance.
<br><br>
<b>GUILD LEADER:</b> The guild leader shall reserve the right to overrule any decision made by the AC if it is in the best interest of the guild. However, the guild leader shall respect the decisions of the AC if at all possible and shall not violate any conditions of this policy. The guild leader must immediately report to the officers any AC decision that has been overridden.
