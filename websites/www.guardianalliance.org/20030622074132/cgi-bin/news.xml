The Final Chapter
</header>
<body>
It has abeen a long journey, but now the guild known as Guardian Alliance is disbanding.  We thank and salute those who have contritbuted to our experience in Norrath and abroad for the past 2 years. Rather than dwindle, we have decided to leave at a point where many can recall GA with fond memories and with mutual respect.  Our members, who are knowledgeable and skilled, are parting on amicable terms.  We wish them the best and a final bow to the Zebuxoruk server.  Thank you.
