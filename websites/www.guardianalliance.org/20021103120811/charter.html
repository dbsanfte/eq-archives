<br>
<b>EXISTENCE</b>: We believe a guild exists for two reasons: 1) to provide a sense of community and 2) to create a pool of resources that can be used to accomplish more than any single individual can achieve on his/her own.<br> 
<br>
We believe all classes and races of Norrath should come together to create an alliance to guard against the common enemies that roam the world. We believe a guild should strive to serve its members, to grow in a controlled manner, and to provide a forum for enjoying one’s time in Norrath. Most importantly, we will strive to maintain a sense of community, where members feel welcome and know one another.<br> 
<br>
<b>ADMISSION</b>: As a general rule, potential recruits must achieve level 40 before being admitted to the guild. The rules of admission will be outlined under the Admissions Policy.<br>
<br>
<b>CONDUCT</b>: All members are expected to conduct themselves in an honorable way. This applies when dealing with other members as well as non-members. Others will be treated with respect and dignity. Kill stealing, harassing, begging, whining, nagging, flaming, and other behavior that would be deemed unacceptable will not be tolerated.<br> 
<br>
It is understood that the game is played in different ways by the guild’s members. As such, asking for money, items, and power leveling is acceptable if done in an appropriate manner. However, other guild members should not be harassed or expected to help another player with any such request.<br> 
<br>
<b>COMMUNICATION</b>: The success of a guild is largely based on the communication of its members, among themselves and with the guild’s officers. The guild’s website is the primary, and usually the only, means of communication outside the game. As such, all members are expected to check for messages and events on a weekly basis, at a minimum.<br> 
<br>
Character information on the website must be kept up to date.<br> 
<br>
There will be a monthly sign-in required of all members. The sign-in will be announced in the Message of the Day and will be located in the Forum section of the website. If a member misses two consecutive sign-ins, it will be assumed that the member has left EQ or the guild, unless an officer has otherwise been informed. Their character information will be deleted and they will be officially removed from the guild. As a courtesy, an officer should be informed if you are expecting to be away for more than two weeks.<br> 
<br>
<b>GUILD PARTICIPATION</b>: Members are expected to attend official pre-scheduled, non-raid events if they are online at that time.<br> 
<br>
When possible, members should group together. It is encouraged, though not required, that a member leave an existing non-guild group in order to group with other members in the same zone. A non-guild member shall not be removed from a group for the sake of freeing up a slot for a guild member, unless the non-guild member was informed of such a possibility prior to joining the group (everyone must be treated with respect and dignity).<br> 
<br>
The services of a member can be requested at anytime, but should not be expected. The person making the request should do everything possible to minimize the disruption to the person being asked for help. This may include traveling to a specific location, arranging for transportation for the person being asked, or simply being patient.<br> 
<br>
If a member is requesting a service from you (port, res, skill, etc.) and you are available, you are encouraged to respond if at all possible. It is ultimately the judgment of the person being asked whether he/she is available.<br>
<br>
<b>GUILD CHAT AND FORUMS</b>: These are not to be used to vent negative feelings about the guild, the way it is being run, or other members of the guild. If a guild member has any concerns about the guild, he/she should contact an officer. Constant negativity in any fashion will be grounds for dismissal, as outlined under the Dismissal Policy.<br>
<br>
<b>RAIDS</b>: Raids are a part of the game. It takes organization and participation in order to properly raid. Raids will be scheduled as appropriate, and members are strongly encouraged to participate. The main purpose of raids should not be about experience, money, or items. Rather, the main goal of a raid is about bringing the guild together to experience and to enjoy an additional aspect of the game. Most importantly, raids are about having fun. Raid rules and policies, including the scheduling of raids, looting rules, and other issues relating to raids, will be established and maintained by the Raid Committee.<br>
<br>
<b>LEAVING THE GUILD</b>: A guild member which leaves in good standing may rejoin the guild at any time without going through the application process. In order to leave in good standing, notice must be given through the posting of a message on the guild's website, including the reason the member is leaving. All others voluntarily leaving will be given a two week grace period, after which time they must go through the application process to rejoin the guild.<br>
<br>
<b>DISMISSALS</b>: Dismissals shall be handled as outlined under the Dismissal Policy.<br> 
<br>
<b>FUN</b>: Required, no exceptions!<br>
