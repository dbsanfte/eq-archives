Join the <b>Days of Tranquility Wiki</b> by registering your preferences, signing the guest register, and putting a little information on your home page. Then you can edit pages, and your name will appear in the [Recent Changes]<a href="wiki.pl?action=edit&id=Recent_Changes">?</a> listing as the editor of the change. You don't have to register to edit pages (you'll just be shown as a semi-anonymous IP address in the Recent Changes reference), but it would be nice if you would give us a little profile of some sort. Here's how:
<p>
<OL>
<li> Go to the Preferences page by clicking on <b>[Preferences]</b> (at top or bottom of any page).
<li> Put in the name you want to use the <b>User Name</b> box. Your User Name has to have an initial capital like [Yueh]. Use the underscore for the space between words.
<li> Put in a private password in the <b>Set Password</b> box.  If you haven't previously entered a password this will set it.
<li> Put the guild password (same as privat message board password) in the <b>Administrator Password</b> box.  This allows the guild members to edit Wiki pages.
<li> Decide if you want to be notified when someone changes a page. If you do, put your email address in the box, and mark the <b>Include this address in the site email list</b> checkbox.
<li> Click on <b>[Save]</b> at the bottom of the registration page to save your preferences.
<li> Go to the <b><a href="wiki.pl?GuildRoster">GuildRoster</a></b>. <b>This is where you create your own home page!</b>
<li> Click on <b>[Edit text of this page]</b> at the bottom of <b><a href="wiki.pl?GuildRoster">GuildRoster</a></b> page to bring up the <b>edit box</b> and see how the page was written.
<li> Add your User Name and email address in the same pattern as the other entries -- semicolon, <code>[[name in double brackets]]</code>, colon, brief-ID description, email address in mailto format.
<li> Click on <b>[Save]</b>.
<li> When the page reformats, you will see your new User Name entry. Your name will have an underlined question mark after it. This is a wiki sign that a page has been created but not filled-in. Click on the question mark.
<li> You will go to your new Home Page.
<li> The new page will open in editing mode, all ready for you to start typing.
<li> Tell as much, or as little, about yourself as you wish, by typing text into the <b>edit box</b>.
<li> Click on <b>[Save]</b>.
</OL>
<p>
Now you're a member of the eBook Library Wiki Experiment!
<p>
<UL>
<li> Go through the <b><a href="wiki.pl?Intro_and_Tour">Intro and Tour</a></b> (at least read it through) to see what it's all about.
<li> Click on <b>[Edit text of this page]</b> at the bottom of any page to edit that page.
<li> To back out of the <b>edit box</b> without changing anything, click on your browser's <b>[Back]</b> button.
<li> Click on <b>[Recent Changes]</b> at the bottom of any page to see what's been edited recently.
</UL>
<p>
Welcome aboard!
