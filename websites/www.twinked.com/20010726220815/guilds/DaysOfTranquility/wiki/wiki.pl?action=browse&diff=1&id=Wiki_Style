<hr><b>No diff available--this is the first major revision.</b>
(no other diffs)<hr>Wiki interactions are free-form, so you may invent your own style, your own way of doing things. The basic rule seems to be -- Do the Right Thing. Here are some ideas to try out --
<p>
<b>Write a signed document</b>
<p>
<DL>
<dt><dd>Write a page, an article, an essay, or some similar block of thought, and put your User Name at the end so folks can see who wrote it. Signed articles invite comment, just by being on a wiki. Since a signature says "I wrote this", it would be best to leave the text of a signed article alone, and simply add comments to the bottom of the article, like a reviewer's notes. In other words, if you disagree with a signed article, state your disagreement rather than editing the article to make it agree with your view. Comments are usually signed, but not always.
</DL>
<p>
<b>Write an unsigned document</b>
<p>
<DL>
<dt><dd>An article with no signature, an anonymous article, is usually an idea that wants improvement. Anyone who comes along can edit the article, or even claim ownership by hanging a signature on it!
</DL>
<p>
<b>Start a thread</b>
<p>
<DL>
<dt><dd>A "thread" is a series of connected comments, a running discussion. Threads might evolve from any kind of document, if people get into dicussing the contents of the originating document. To keep straight who said what, it's usually a good idea to sign contributions to a thread, or at least initial them like this -- jer
</DL>
<p>
<b>Split a thread</b>
<p>
<DL>
<dt><dd>Sometimes a branch, or subtopic, of a thread seems to take on a life of its own. These subtopics might be happier if they were split off into a new page, with a link from (and back to!) the originating page.
</DL>
<p>
<b>Do it your way</b>
<p>
<DL>
<dt><dd>The main idea is to communicate. If you have a better way of doing that than the examples you see on this or other wikis, try it out! Show your stuff. You could start a whole new trend of doing things a better way, and we'll all benefit from it.
