<br>
1. Guild members must work together to better themselves &amp; the guild<br>
<br>

as<br>
a member of TD at which point he/she will undergo a 30 day probational period in<br>
which he/she will be assigned an officer to oversee his/her actions. <br>
<br>
* we should refrain from limiting recruiting to a specific level(s) because good<br>
new players are a scarcity, instead we should improve on our initiation process.<br>
<br>
3. Participation in guild events is voluntary but required.&nbsp; An event
organizer has<br>
the authority at his/her discretion to call upon members for posted events who
are<br>
online but did not register for the event to join regardless of the amount of
time<br>
that member has to play or what he/she is doing at that time.<br>
