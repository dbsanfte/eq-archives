The original history is recounted below.</font></p>

<p><font face="Tahoma"><big><strong>CHARTER</strong></big></font></p>

<p><font face="Tahoma">The goals of the Stormseekers are as follows:<br>
<small>&#149;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HAVE FUN with each other!</small><br>
<small>&#149;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Support each other in tasks we wish to accomplish,
such as quests, tradeskills, teleports, etc.<br>
&#149;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Develop our skills as groupmembers, to be as effective as
we can.<br>
&#149;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gain a reputation as effective and important people
throughout Norrath<br>
&#149;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Take every opportunity to fight evil, as per Aku Zoku Zan
(See Evil, Kill Evil).</small></font></p>

<p><font face="Tahoma">Secondary goals:<br>
<small>&#149;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roleplaying is strongly encouraged, since it makes
the game more fun!<br>
&#149;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Keep the game at a PG rating.&nbsp; Young people play it,
too.</small></font></p>

<p><font face="Tahoma"><small>When Stormseekers are in the same zone and one shouts out
&quot;Aku Zoku Zan,&quot; which is our motto (&quot;See Evil, Kill Evil&quot;), the proper
response is to shout Aku Zoku Zan or See Evil, Kill Evil back.</small></font></p>

    <td align="left" height="*" vAlign="top" width="96%"><font face="Courier" size="2">In the
    beginning, 2 founders: Founder Ailine and Founder Reaveline formed the Stormseekers. It is
    a guild formed on the belief of &quot;<i>Aku Zoku Zan</i>&quot; (&quot;<i>See Evil, Kill
    Evil</i>&quot;). The idea to form the guild came about when the Founders, Ailine and
    Reaveline, met Warlord Bagary and Royal Wizard Rapun&#146;eth. It was about 1 year ago,
    when we first met these Legends; Warlord Bagary was a half-elf and very skilled sword
    fighter with a shield named Stormseekers. The King bestowed the Stormseekers upon Lord
    Bagary in the human city, Freeport. The Royal Wizard Rapun&#146;eth was a high-elf, an
    intelligent man with a great vision, he mastered the Arcane knowledge at a level the
    commoner can only dream of achieving.</font><p><font face="Courier" size="2">The two was
    on a journey, a journey to not only improve themselves but also to eliminate any
    corruption and evil that roam throughout the world of Norrath. When Lord Bagary and Wizard
    Rapun&#146;eth were in the Greater Faydark, we studied under the Warlord and the Royal
    Wizard for more than a year. Founder Reaveline decided to struggle on his physical side,
    while Founder Ailine learned the secret of magic and the Arcane Knowledge.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Courier" size="2">After one year passed, it was time for both Legends to
    carry on with their quests and journeys. We were not allowed to follow them, but their
    dreams and visions inspired us to form this guild. Stormseekers has one and only
    principle, &quot;<i>See Evil, Kill Evil</i>&quot;, we DO NOT protect the good; but we WILL
    kill evil when we see one. This belief was passed down to us by Royal Wizard
    Rapun&#146;eth. He also mentioned that in the events where two parties are fighting for
    something that is evil/wrong, we would not take sides, for if we did we would have to
    fight and kill both parties.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Courier" size="2">About 1 month after the departure of the Legends, the
    Founders received a parcel sent by the King&#146;s Royal Guard. Inside we found a badly
    burned shield and a book. The shield was the Stormseekers owned by the Warlord Bagary and
    the book &quot;Way of the Seekers&quot; was written and the only belonging left of Royal
    Wizard Rapun&#146;eth. Later, the Royal Guard informed us that both the Legends were slain
    by fire dragons. But their last quest was not in vain, it seemed that the Royal Wizard
    Rapun&#146;eth managed to destroy the cavern where the dragon clan lived, killing many
    dragons in the process.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Courier" size="2">Founder Reaveline repaired the Stormseekers and preserved
    it in our Guildhall as our emblem. The book itself contains the law, principle, and
    knowledge of the Royal Wizard. The book is being used as the guild&#146;s holy book.</font></td>
