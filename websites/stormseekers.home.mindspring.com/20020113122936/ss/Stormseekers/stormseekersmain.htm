two airplanes almost collide why do they call it a near miss? It sounds like a near hit to
me!</p>

<p><small>What a day we had!&nbsp; Xeckis, Ducem, and Arrk all obtained a much-needed part
of our epic quests.&nbsp; Xeckis had the help of Milmorran, Ducem, Palludar, and Arrk
among about 30 other people to help kill Eejag in Lavastorm.&nbsp; A good turnout of
Stormseekers for that event!&nbsp; From there, we went with Vrond, Ambir, Mohun, Serina,
Cureall, and Marjelle to West Karana to get my piece of magic white paper.&nbsp; Despite
some bad intelligence indicating the bandit was level 50 instead of level 55, we were
eventually victorious.&nbsp; From there, Stormseekers only went on to East Karana, where
we were joined by Gnamish and we all killed Ducem's Dark Elf Corruptor, and even made
short work of Tarbul Earthstrider!</small></p>

<p><small>A very productive evening indeed.&nbsp; We must do more things like that, and
not just among high-level people, but with anything that anyone needs done, to accomplish
a quest, get a specific item, or anything.&nbsp; Post something on the forum!</small></p>

<p><small>Congratulations to Tirnanog and Lemoliana, who were married by Jenoleic on
9/9/01.&nbsp; May they be very happy together!&nbsp; Pictures from the occasion are listed
<a href="everquest_pictures_categories.htm">here</a>.</small></p>

<p><small>Our last-minute party was a lot of fun!&nbsp; I am sure everyone had a good
time, and I KNOW I did.&nbsp; Especial congratulations to Gaton for winning the mid-level
dueling!&nbsp; There are&nbsp; pictures of the people who came, which can be viewed <a href="everquest_pictures_categories.htm">here</a>.</small></p>

<p><small>Do not forget that we have another language fair on 7/26/01!&nbsp; Hopefully
everyone can learn something new.</small></p>

<p><small>6/28/01</small></p>

<p><small>In case anyone was not aware, we are now recording some of the newspapers to be
seen around Norrath in the Posted Information section.&nbsp; To view the 3 newspapers
recorded, click <a href="Posted%20Info/posted_information.htm#Newspaper Texts">here</a>.&nbsp;
If you run across a newspaper that we do not have recorded and want it posted, send the
information to any officer, or especially to <a href="mailto:msfostr@yahoo.com">msfostr@yahoo.com</a>.</small></p>

<p><small>I happened to go to the bottom of Befallen, and it seems things have changed a
bit!&nbsp; Servants of T'Vyl, possibly Lanys T'Vyl, the estranged daughter of Innoruuk,
are common and attack even their betters there.&nbsp; I would guess these servants, the
ones I have seen at least, are about 25th level, since they were double attacking for
about 50 damage.&nbsp; Perhaps the time has come to raid again!</small></p>

<p><small>6/16/01</small></p>

<p><small>The evil residents of Befallen were no match for the Stormseekers!&nbsp; This
was not entirely a good thing, for we gained little experience there, and Babbinsbort, the
reason Jenoleic wanted to go, was afraid to show his face.&nbsp; Nonetheless, we DID have
fun, and it was a reasonable start for a raid.&nbsp; We just need to find more powerful
evil things to kill...</small></p>

<p><small>To see a couple pictures of our raid, click <a href="everquest_pictures_categories.htm">here</a>.</small></p>

<p><small>6/1/01</small></p>

<p><small>A sudden influx of new members!&nbsp; Welcome Kilrail, Lemoliana, and Milmorran!
&nbsp; I hope you enjoy the guild as much as we enjoy having you with us.&nbsp; If anyone
knows others that would be good members of the Stormseekers, please let an officer know.</small></p>

<p><small>And if you see anything that would make a good picture, take a screenshot and
send it to me, and I will post it as another picture.&nbsp; Take a look...there are some
interesting pictures I have already posted.&nbsp; Most are for humor's sake, but if you
ever wondered what the dragon Gorenaire looked like, you can find out now.</small></p>

<p><small>Remember our raid on the Lower Guk Ghoul Sage on 5/12/01 at 11am EDT!&nbsp; We
should be able to get some good loot from him.&nbsp; Such an evil being surely does not
need it anyway.&nbsp; The Ancient Guardians will also be attending for fun and profit.</small></p>
<small>

<p><small><strong><font face="Tahoma">Yesterday, we joined forces with the Ancient
Guardians to improve our linguistic capabilities.&nbsp; Many of us learned new languages,
such as Dark Speech, Thieve's Cant, Lizardman, and Troll (the language of romance). &nbsp;
Certainly, it was a success, and I look forward to the next language fair!&nbsp; I have
more now to teach.</font></strong></small></p>

<p><small><strong><font face="Tahoma">I changed the font on this home page; hopefully it
will be easier to read.&nbsp; Let me know what you think!&nbsp; Check the forum often, and
post your thoughts.</font></strong></small></p>

<p><small><strong><font face="Tahoma">4/15/01</font></strong></small></p>

<p><small><strong><font face="Tahoma">This IS a guild, and we work together to accomplish
goals.&nbsp; I have two goals I want now to accomplish, and I need our help!&nbsp; Check
the Forum for more information.</font></strong></small></p>

<p><small><strong><font face="Tahoma">And check the forum often!&nbsp; It is there we are
best able to communicate, since not everyone is online at once, yet everyone can leave
messages for the guild in the forum, and read them at leisure.</font></strong></small></p>

<p><small><strong><font face="Tahoma">3/25/01</font></strong></small></p>

<p><small><strong><font face="Tahoma">Behold, the vast changes that have taken place
within the StormSeekers!&nbsp; For example, this is a new web page.&nbsp; News will now be
posted here.&nbsp; Also, a new forum has been set up, on EzBoard, since no one is sure how
to get administration for the other board.</font></strong></small></p>

<p><small><strong><font face="Tahoma">Well, we will press on!&nbsp; The StormSeekers is
about to have a rebirth, and that will first mean new members to bring it about.&nbsp;
Recruit anyone that seems worthy, and remember quality is more important than quantity,
even with the current (very small) roster.&nbsp; Roleplaying interest is highly
desireable, but the only requirement is that one merely not be &quot;evil.&quot;</font></strong></small></p>

<p><small><strong><font face="Tahoma">Remember our motto, as listed above, &quot;Aku Zoku
Zan,&quot; which means &quot;See Evil, Kill Evil.&quot;&nbsp; Thus is the storm sought,
and bested, by diligence, hard work, and perseverence through adversity.</font></strong></small></p>
