    Mindmaster, that's me.&nbsp; A bit about myself?</font></small><p><font face="Tahoma"><small>Well,
    I grew up in Ak'Anon, and knew at an early age I was going to follow my father in the
    creation of new labor-saving devices.&nbsp; At least, so I was told.&nbsp; But no one knew
    there were so many ways of making things blow up under too much pressure, or other
    reasons, until I did some of my work.</small><br>

    <td width="100%" valign="top" style="border: medium none" colspan="2"><small><font face="Tahoma">My mother complained of the smokes and smells.&nbsp; My father grew worried
    for his own work, since some of his customers began to wonder whether I helped him in any
    of the projects he was selling.&nbsp; They decided to send me, at the tender age of about
    25, to the Library of the Mechanimagica to &quot;broaden my horizons.&quot;&nbsp; Father
    thought maybe I could get some magic to work in some of his machines.&nbsp; So he told me.
    &nbsp; I know better now.</font></small><p><small><font face="Tahoma">The magicians took
    me into their classrooms at first, but they were too, well, earthy in nature for my
    liking.&nbsp; Constantly babbling about how true power is all around everyone, to be
    controlled by those with clever and strong enough minds to use it.&nbsp; Very dull
    lectures, I must say.&nbsp; They did not like it when I demonstrated how boring their
    lectures were.&nbsp; They decided I could use some &quot;cross-training&quot; by the
    necromancer guild, that was not even in the same building.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Tahoma">THAT is a creepy place.&nbsp; Filled with creepy people.
    &nbsp; I cannot be sure, but I think dead things are supposed to be buried.&nbsp; They
    said they are buried as kind of an &quot;aging&quot; process, sort of like wine, and they
    are dug up again when they are suitably decayed and can be used as servants.&nbsp; While
    more interesting than the magician's works, certainly the lectures were at least, I still
    could not see how one can get satisfaction by using all these dead things to do one's
    bidding.&nbsp; When my time was up, I went back to the Library of the Mechanimagica, under
    the courseplan of wizardry.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Tahoma">I would have thought, with all the explosions I made at
    home, the wizards would have lots of interesting things to do.&nbsp; They did have some,
    but it was mostly lost in the lessons on discipline and ethics.&nbsp; Sort of like telling
    someone using a sword that the sword is best used going neither left nor right, but
    straight at the person you want to kill.&nbsp; And make sure you actually want to kill
    that person, before unsheathing the sword.&nbsp; Um...duh.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Tahoma">When the wizards had had enough of me, they sent me to the
    enchanters.&nbsp; Sounds like they were about to kick me out, since I had been to every
    other part of the school.&nbsp; And strangely enough, I found it interesting and
    challenging.&nbsp; Thinking back now, I suspect the teachers themselves had something to
    do with it, implanting feelings of acceptance in me.&nbsp; But enchanted or not, I grew
    involved with my apprenticeships.&nbsp; Eventually, before I knew it, I was over 40 and
    had learned a great deal.&nbsp; I left Ak'Anon and ventured out into Norrath to learn more
    than my teachers would teach.</font></small></td>
