Keeper of the Treasury<br>

<p><small><font face="Tahoma">I, Jenoleic, have supported my guild, the Stormseekers, for
a long time.&nbsp; It is second in my thoughts, next to Brell Serilis, whom I serve as a
cleric.&nbsp; Brell must like what I am doing.&nbsp; I know, because He has blessed me
with the ability to make lots and lots of Brell's Blessed Stout, which I give out freely
to all that need it.&nbsp; It's important to be well-supplied with Stout.&nbsp; It helps
keep people happy.</font></small></p>

<p><small><font face="Tahoma">Also, I like to sell things.&nbsp; For profit.&nbsp; Dwarves
may be known as greedy, and some are of course, but I like to think I am generous. &nbsp;
At least to other good people.&nbsp; But I will buy and sell things, as a service to
others.</font></small></p>

<p><small><font face="Tahoma">I am the Keeper of the Treasury for the Stormseekers. &nbsp;
I hold the items people donate, and sell the excess ones for a contribution to the
monetary treasury.&nbsp; Don't worry, I get paid for it.&nbsp; If I sell something for a
LOT of money, I get to keep the excess over what is expected.</font></small></p>

    is a friend of mine, who I introduced into the Stormseekers.&nbsp; We still like to group,
    so we can speak to each other easily and to be safer when killing bad things.&nbsp; I try
    not to let her die.&nbsp; I think it has worked.&nbsp; But even if she dies, I can make
    her better.</font></small><p><small><font face="Tahoma">She moves me all over Norrath at
    my command.&nbsp; Well, my request.&nbsp; Alright, when I beg her.&nbsp; But she is nice,
    and helps me a lot.</font></small></td>

<p><small><font face="Tahoma">Healing?&nbsp; Oh, HEALING!&nbsp; Yes, being a cleric, I
heal people.&nbsp; That nasty orc cut off your foot?&nbsp; No problem, I just magically
make a new one for you.</font></small></p>

<p><small><font face="Tahoma">Naturally, a cleric does more than heal.&nbsp; I heal
FRIENDS.&nbsp; I know SOMEONE made it necessary for me to heal them, and whoever or
whatever did it may feel the righteous wrath of Brell, delivered through His humble
instrument, me.&nbsp; Every once in a while it feels good to keep muscles limber that get
stiff from too much meditating, and I go whack something.</font></small></p>
