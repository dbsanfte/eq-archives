<TR><TD>To all those who took a minute out of the family barbecue to read our news page, heres my attempt. Tribes 2 had a new official patch this AM and yes our server is still up. The locals of Ft. Smith are preparing for the get together this weekend, seems there will be a little inter-clan LAN tourney goin on. I speak for most when I say we hope Furious loses for a change. DLC hopes everyone has a safe 4th of July and DO NOT let Immortal near your fireworks bag! ....And that's the rest of the story!

<TR><TD>As you can see, there has not been a lot of additions to the news page lately.  We seem to have had an outbreak among the news posters of addictions to that <A href=http://www.everquest.com>EVIL</a> drug that has been going around for a couple of years.
