<P>
Posting to the DLC Bulletin Board is a privilege and not a right. The Public Forums are there so that friends of DLC and DLC members can have a clean, decent place for discussions.  They are also there so that folks that play on our servers have a place to discuss the servers and problems with them. We have had these rules in the past, but feel that it is time to put them down in writing so that everyone is aware of them.
<p />
<ul>
<li> <strong>Excessive cussing is not permitted.</strong> While occasional cussing is acceptable, please keep it to a socially acceptable level.
</ul>
<p />
<ul>
<li> <strong>Be civil to others.</strong> This is a place for discussion and debate, this is not a place for you to rag on others, yell, scream, throw a temper tantrum, or otherwise make life miserable for others. Remember that if you can't say anything nice, don't say anything at all.
</ul>
<p />
<ul>
<li> <strong>Make no comments about participation in illegal activities.</strong> Comments about illegal activities (sharing MP3s, pirating software, rape, murder, etc.) will not be tolerated on the forums. This is to protect our ability to have the forums. This includes asking about software to use in these activities, or procedures in doing any of those activities.
</ul>
<p />
<ul>
<li> <strong>Moderation and censorship are a fact of life.</strong> If your thread has been removed, locked, edited, etc. there was a good reason for it. If a Moderator did not Private Message you with the reason, Private Message one of the Moderators or the Administrators and ask them why your thread is gone. (Generally a locked thread means to drop the topic, so don't start another thread with the same topic.)  Most of the time on a locked thread or an edit, we will post an explanation. If the thread was a blatant violation of the rules, don't expect a reason for the removal, just expect it to be removed. The Moderators each view stuff differently, and it's up to that individual to determine if you'll be Moderated.
</ul>
<p />
<ul>
<li> "Die thread, die" comments are meant to tell you that this thread is getting close to being Moderated. Either clean up what's being discussed or get back On-Topic.
</ul>
<p />
<ul>
<li> <strong>Intentionally hi-jacking a thread may be Moderated.</strong> If you want to discuss a new non-related topic, start a new thread.
</ul>
<p />
<ul>
<li> <strong>Keep private discussions off of the forums.</strong> We really don't want to hear you making fun of each other. There's a built in Private Messaging system, use it, it's great.
</ul>
<p />
<ul>
<li> If you think that something needs Moderated, either email, ICQ, or Private Message one of the Admins or Moderators (please make sure that you choose a Moderator that has rights to that forum).
</ul>
<p />
<ul>
<li> Ignorance of the rules is not an excuse... <em>ever</em>.
</ul>
<p />
While we don't tend to enforce grammatical rules, it's a good idea to at least try for good grammar. People have fewer communication problems if they can understand what you are talking about. Many people on the forums will just skip over a post that is poorly written. If you want your post to be read, it might be a good idea to put some effort into it.
