<li> <strong>Moderation and censorship are a fact of life.</strong> If your thread has been removed, locked, edited, etc. there was a good reason for it. If a Moderator did not Private Message you with the reason, Private Message one of the Moderators or the Administrators and ask them why your thread is gone. (Generally a locked thread means to drop the topic, so don't start another thread with the same topic.)  Most of the time on a locked thread or an edit, we will post an explanation. If the thread was a blatant violation of the rules, don't expect a reason for the removal, just expect it to be removed. The Moderators each view stuff differently, and it's up to that individual to determine if you'll be Moderated.

Posting to the DLC Bulletin Board is a privilege and not a right. The Public Forums are there so that friends of DLC and DLC members can have a clean, decent place for discussions.  They are also there so that folks that play on our servers have a place to discuss the servers and problems with them. We have had these rules in the past, but feel that it is time to put them down in writing so that everyone is aware of them.

While we don't tend to enforce grammatical rules, it's a good idea to at least try for good grammar. People have fewer communication problems if they can understand what you are talking about. Many people on the forums will just skip over a post that is poorly written. If you want your post to be read, it might be a good idea to put some effort into it.</td></tr>
