<h1><a name ="Overview"> </a> Overview </h1>
<p />
<a href="http://www.homeworld2.com" target="_top">HomeWorld 2</a> (HW2) is the next RTS in the HomeWorld series by <a href="http://www.relic.com" target="_top">Relic Entertainment</a>.  It's a space-based RTS that is set in a 3D environment.  You basically control a Mothership and a fleet of other ships that will allow you to combat other players or AI.

<p />
This game does have a few things going for it.
<p />
<strong>Music</strong> &#151; The music fits HW2 perfectly.  When you enter battle, the music ramps up to help pump your adrenaline.  It has a very futuristic sound, but keeps a good ancient feel to it to help ground you back in the history of the game's story.
<p />
<strong>Visuals</strong> &#151; The battlefield backdrops are stunningly beautiful as well as the clouds and special effects.  Each of the maps makes you feel like you're really in that kind of environment in space.
<p />
<strong>Build Management</strong> &#151; HW2 allows you to easily view everything that's being built, and to cancel or pause each construction.  This shows up in a little piece of the HUD that doesn't block the screen like the main Build screen does.
<p />
<strong>HUD</strong> &#151; They did some great work on making the HUD work well.  It's easy to use and navigate.
<p />
<strong>Story</strong> &#151; Badass story, great ending.
<p />
<HR WIDTH="85%">
<p />
<h1><a name ="Cons"> </a> Cons </h1>
<p />
<strong>HUD</strong> &#151; One of the downsides to the HUD in this game is that it takes up so much space.  Not as much space as a game like the WarCraft series, but a ton more space then Empire Earth.  This means that it can be harder to view a battle going on unless you clear the HUD from your screen.  If you clear the HUD, you better have your hotkeys memorized.
<p />
<strong>Multiplayer</strong> &#151; You're only allowed 6 players in Multiplayer.  That is just a horrible design decision.  True, it'll allow them to not have to worry about the net code, but it means that you have to play more against other players then cooperatively against the AI.  IMO, because the AI isn't up to standard, there's not much replayability to Multiplayer.
<p />
<strong>MP Options</strong> &#151; Where'd all the options go?!?!  In HomeWorld 1 there was a ton of options you could set for MP.  Stuff like Resource Injections, Crates, etc.  You don't have any of those anymore.
<p />
<strong>AI</strong> &#151; The AI sucks.  Horribly.  A three-year-old child could defeat it.  (Well, ok, maybe not that young.)  Basically, the AI's main goal in life is to destroy your resourcers.  That means that it can be lured into traps fairly easily and destroyed.  Also, the AI doesn't really ever build up his fleet into a crushing fleet.  He tends to send out little bits of his fleet out at a time.  Those little fleets won't do anything but be annoying.  Against a good player, they are slaughtered (against slow / stupid players, they might be effective).
<p />
<strong>Single Player</strong> &#151; I have several gripes about Single Player:
<ul >
<li> <em>Dynamic Difficulty Scaling</em> &#151; This never seemed to work when I played it.  Except that the beginnings of most missions were a cakewalk, then the rest of the mission was moderate.  They really needed to add an option in the game to allow you to set the difficulty level.
</li>
<li> <em>Not Long Enough</em> &#151; I beat the game in ~9 hours.  That's just three nights of playing to beat 15 missions.  I guess if you got stuck in a mission or something, then it would take you a lot longer, but still, that wasn't enough.
</li>
<li> <em>Enemy Fleet Size</em> &#151; The strength of the AI in the SP game is that he has a large initial fleet that he can use the crush you.  But if you can slaughter his initial fleet (which isn't hard to do), then he can't build enough units fast enough to make it tough.
</li>
<li> <em>Auto Resource Gathering</em> &#151; They really needed to make this a button or an option.  For most of the missions, this was great, saves you a lot of time.  But there's a few missions that you need to be able to turn this off so that you can build up your fleet before you proceed.
</li>
</ul>
<p />
<strong>Limited Units</strong> &#151; This is really two gripes.  The first is that I don't like games that limit me to a handful of units (something like 150 on high, more like 75 on low / single player).  That just pissed me off that I can't have a larger army, I have to deal with small armies / fleets.  The other part is that they further divide up the size of your fleet by saying that you can only have X of this type of unit.  On small and medium (default for MP) units the even split it into sub groupings (like only allowing 4 Capture Frigates instead of just 25 Frigates).
<p />
<strong>Strike Groups</strong> &#151; Strike Groups suck.  Period.  All they will do is get your units killed by making your units try to get back into formation instead of fight.  The formations in HW1 were awesome, too bad they didn't redo them for HW2.
<p />
I have more Cons for this game, but in the interest of keeping this review short, I'll stop here.

<h1><a name ="Conclusion"> </a> Conclusion </h1>
<p />
Don't buy it.  Or if you must, wait until it's in the Bargain Bin. Or just borrow it from a friend.
<p />
This game looks great and sounds great, but the game play just isn't there.  They need to take lessons from games like Total Annihilation and Empire Earth on how to create a more epic feeling RTS.
<p />
Overall, HomeWorld 2 isn't much advanced over HomeWorld 1.  It's like they just upgraded the graphics engine and put a new story behind it, but didn't try to improve on the game play.  If anything, the game play is worse.
