    <b>Scott Shean on the O'Reilly Factor</b><br>

    Last night, on Bill O'Reilly's email segment, our ex-fearless leader/co-owner of Computer Recyclers, Scott Shean, had an email that he sent to the program read on national television.  <br><br>
    <br><br>
    His email consisted of laying blame for the recent downturn of the stock market.  It was short and to the point, but only partially true.  My new hero, Bill O'Reilly, completely destroyed his argument.  With a lecturing tone in his voice, Mr. O'Reilly berated Scott and almost angrily explained why he was wrong.  I dont have anything against Mr. Shean personally, but I would be lying to say that I did not receive pleasure from watching a former boss humiliated on national television.  I laughed like I never laughed before.  I stood and cheered like the Saints had just won a playoff game.  I guess the moral of the story is to be careful of expressing your opinions on television.  You never know who is watching.<br>
