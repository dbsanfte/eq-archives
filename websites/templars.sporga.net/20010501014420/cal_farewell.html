<p><font size="+1"><b>Calendria Cymorial's farewell</b></font></p>

<p><a href="members/calendria.html">Who was Calendria</a></p>

<p>Calendria sat in the Karana sunlight staring off into the waterfall that
fed the rivers of the Karanas.  Completely lost in her blissful thoughts
she didn't at first notice the tugging on her robes.  Looking down she
could see that all-so familiar gnome standing next to her.</p>

<p>&quot;You drifted off again Cal, what's wrong?&quot;  Questioned Glymmarach.
&quot;Oh, there is nothing wrong, nothing at all,&quot; she responded, a smile on
her face that matched the shining of the sun above them.  &quot;I can hear it
calling to me, a beautiful voice that needs me, wants me, and calls out to
me from lands other than the ones known on Norrath, lands beyond the
control of our gods,&quot; she said, once again staring off into the distance.&quot;
&quot;Oh?  And what does it mean.&quot;</p>

<p>Calendria looked back down at Glymmarach, this time her beaming smile was
replaced with a frown, and eyes that were watering at the loss she knew
she would have to face.</p>

<p>&quot;I have to go, something is calling to me and I have to follow my heart. 
I will miss you all.  I have never known a finer bunch of people than you
five and the Templars.  I will always be thinking of you all, but it's
time that I close my book, put away my wand, and leave to a future that
calls for me.&quot;</p>

<p>Glymmarach stood silent, not quite sure what to say to her.</p>

<p>&quot;Hopefully I will be able to return in the future and visit you all on
occasion, but for now I must go.  I will certainly be back to visit,
although I can not say when, or for how long.&quot;</p>

<p>And with that Calendria pulled out a scroll and began to recite the
magical inscriptions written upon the scroll.  As bubbles of pure magic
formed around her, drifting to and fro, her image faded and soon she
vanished.</p>

<hr>

<p>I regret to say this, and I do it with very heavy heart.  Something
wonderful is happening to me in real life, and although I can not tell you
what it is, I will tell you that I would not want to miss it for the
world, and that I will miss you all in the future.  I am not closing the
account for a while, so I can come back and visit you from time to time.</p>

<p>I wish you all the best of luck and I have really enjoyed knowing you all.
I can't think of a finer bunch of people I would have wanted to know on
any server.</p>

<p>I love you all and I look forward to talking to you again in the future.</p>
