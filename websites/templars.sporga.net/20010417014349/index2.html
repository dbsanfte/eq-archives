<h3><center><b>Welcome to the home of the Nameless Templars</b></center></h2>

<p>The Nameless Templars is a player Guild on The Nameless server of the on-line roleplaying game, <a href="http://www.everquest.com">EverQuest</a>.  This site will be added to and expanded as time permits.</p>

<hr>

<center><p><font size="+1"><b>January 15, 2001</b></font></p></center>

<p>Lots of stuff happening, but with the addition of the message area, I haven't been posting here as often.</p>

<p>First, for those that have not heard, the Nameless Templars have entered into an official alliance with the Brethren of the Mystic Dawn and Renown.  We are having a bashathon in the Arena Zone on Friday the 17th.  This will be a chance for everyone to come out and meet the people of the other guilds, and to throw some punches while you're at it. :)</p>

<p>Another announcement reguarding the alliance, Chrysania has created an Alliance Planning Calendar at <a href="http://www.calendars.net:8186/ALLIANCEEVENTS">http://www.calendars.net:8186/ALLIANCEEVENTS</a>.  All events should be posted there with pointers tot he hosting guild's site for details and a sign up.  I've added a link to the navigation bar as well.</p>

<p>And speaking of signing up, we <i>need</i> people to sign up for the flagship events like Fear so we know who is going to be there, and how many people we're going to have to try to recruit from outside the guild.  A reminder to Honorary members, you are also invited to all these events, but you still have to sign up.</p>

<p>Lastly, I'm looking for input on the layout of the message areas still.  Format and colors for now.  Restricted access areas will be coming eventually.</p>

<hr>

<center><p><font size="+1"><b>December 20, 2000</b></font></p></center>

<p>I've added a couple more message areas.  One for Raid and Event Planning, and a second for Trades.  I will be adding one or two more in the next week or so.  Make sure you use the correct area so we don't wandering topics (yes, I'm an 'on topic' monger). :P</p>

<p>Huzzah!  I have finally added a message board to the site.  Click the link above to check it out.  It's currently unrestricted, but that will change in the near future.  Note: until I get ahold of Kaie, there will not be a link from the roster page to the message board... so just come back to the news page to get to the message board from the roster.  Now go!  Post, and be merry! :)</p>

<b>Friday, December 22:</b>  Chardok with the Brethren of the Mystic Dawn.  Raid <u><i>Starts</i></u> at 6pm PST, so be there before then.  If you're lvl 40 or above, you're expected to be there unless you talk to me or Darkini directly.<br>

<hr>

<center><p><font size="+1"><b>December 12, 2000</b></font></p></center>

<p>Just a quick announcement about the <b>Guild Meeting</b> tomorrow (Wednesday, Dec 13).  The location is TBA, but the meeting will start at 7pm PST regardless of where people are.  If you don't want to miss anything, don't be late. :)</p>

<hr>

<center><p><font size="+1"><b>November 29, 2000</b></font></p></center>

<p><b>MEETING:</b>  We'll be having a meeting some time tonight.  Because of mine and Darkini's RL committments, we can't say exactly when, but probably around 7:30 pm PST.  Perhaps sooner, if one of us gets home early.  The agenda will be to talk about some coming events over the next month or so, including a probable trip by the council to the Plane of Fear with the Brethren of the Mystic Dawn.</p>

<p>Also on tonights agenda will be to help Foxpetal kill the DE Corrupter in EK, either before or after the meeting proper.  Those of you that can get to EK to help with that, pay attention when Fox gets on, or be in the area.  Everyone else, if you don't want to wander to EK and watch and wait around, you can just chat where you are whent he meeting gets under way.</p>

<p><b>Calendar:</b><br>
<b>Wed, Nov 29:</b> Kill the DE Corruptor for Foxpetal.<br>
<b>Dec 1-3 weekend:</b> Kaesora for part of key quest for Howling Stones (40+), or probably a trip to MM for quest items and general mayhem.<br>
<b>Dec 8-10 weekend:</b> Combined raid with Brethren to Chardock (40+), or an expedition to the Scars of Velious to do some exploration.<br>
<b>Dec 29-30:</b> 6 Templars will be taking a trip to the Plane of Fear with the Brethren of the Mystic Dawn.  More details to follow.</p>

<p><b>MEETING:</b> A meeting will be held on Wednesday, November 22 at 7pm PST in the tunnel in North Ro.  The Agneda will be Sergent promotions, including some that are a bit overdue, and planning some events for the near and further future.  One idea is a trip to the City of Mist this Friday.  Perhaps talk about our next auction.  Any other suggestions are welcome too, including something for the younger members -- I heard someone mention Runnyeye last week, and would be happy to offer advice on that... the guild has a good history there long ago.</p>

<p>I would also like to announce the Knightings of both Sir Staan Aclaus and Sir Kumho Plaguebringa in the past two weeks.  The knightings were done spontaniously when the correct people were on because I felt it important not to wait for a meeting (since I haven't had time for meetings much recently).  Congratulations!</p>

<p><b>Quick Calendar:</b><br>
<b>Tonight:</b> Guild meeting at 6pm PST in the tunnel in North Ro.  This is a time change from the email I sent out on Sunday because 11pm EST is a little late for some people.  Hopefully most of you can make it now.  If you can't get there as soon as possible.  After the meeting there is a good chance we'll get to kill Lucan again (yippee! Darkini needs his fix).<br>
<b>Saturday:</b> The Beer Brawl in Arena hosted by the Brethren of the Mystic Dawn and other will start at noon PST.  And starting sometime in the afternoon/early evening, the Templars will be helping Tristor with the first part of his Epic Quest for the <b>Water Sprinkler of Nem Ankh</b>.  If you have questions about this event, talk to Tristor or Darkini.</p>

<p>Just a quick note about upcoming plans:</p>

<p>Friday, Oct. 27 at 8pm PDT we will have a 'chat-where-you-are' guild meeting.  Have some short but important announcements to make.  If you can be on line for that, it would be a good idea.</p>

<p><b>Water Sprinkler of Nem Ankh</b>: Next weekend we have plans to help Tristor with the first part of him Epic Quest.  Details will be forthcoming when we can find out what time we're going to do it.</p>

<p>And a reminder, if you have a quest that you need people's help with completing, email me and we'll see what we can do to help.  And the key word here is help... don't expect the guild to outright do the quest for you.</p>

<center><p><font size="+1"><b>October 8, 2000</b></font></p></center>

<p>I'm pleased to announce the promotions of Axil and Foxpetal to the rank Master, and to welcome them to the Council.  I'd also like to congradulate Ehvann, Kareke, Rankor, Tempeste and Trevlyn on their promotions to the rank of Sergent.</p>

<p>Congrats also go out to Darkini for the successful completion of his Soulfire quest.  Man, those flaming swords look nice. :)</p>

<p>The Auction... Lots to do here, and we have to start getting things together.  If you have items that you want to sell, send a list to the list.  If you want to help, contact me and let me know what you'd like to help with, or to find out what we need help with.</p>

<p><b>Schedule:</b><br>
<b>This weekend:</b> Plan on hunting in Guk.  Starting Friday, anyone and everyone is invited to come down for decent loot and exp killing frogs in both Upper and Lower Guk.<br>
<b>Friday:</b> Guild meeting.  Time and location TBA, but plan on the east coast of Antonica.<br>
<b>Sunday:</b> Auction!  We need people on hand by 1pm PDT.  I think the actual auction shoud begin at 2pm PDT, and we want to get our guild stuff out of the way first.<br>
<b>Wednesday (next week):</b> Sir Lucan dies again!  Carinao wants his Soulfire, and he has to go through Sir Lucan to get it.  Plan on a short but intense event in West Freeport.  Need two groups 40+ to tackle this one.<br>
<b>Next Weekend:</b> Efreeti Raid!  Also plan the weekend's hunt to be in the Lavastorm area.  Between Lavastorm, Sol A &amp; B, and Najena, there is something for eveyone to hunt.  That Saturday, we will need to assemble 3 groups 40+ to tackle the Efreeti.  Please set aside time for this now.</p>

<p>Congrats to Grogyn for getting his mermaid hair last night... Raincaller is just a faerie princess away. :)</p>

<p><b>Schedule:</b><br>
<b>Wednesday:</b> Darkini's Sir Lucan slaughter for his Soul Fire quest.  8pm PDT.  If you want to play a role, contact Darkini, or ask in the guild channel for details<br>
<b>Friday:</b> Guild meeting.  8pm PDT.  On the agenda will be the Auction, and scheduling the Efreeti raid.  Location will be NRo, and we'll be hunting in Dalnir Friday and Saturday nights, for those that are interested.<br>
<b>Saturday:</b> Dalnir<br>
<b>Sunday:</b> 1pm PDT, Auction.  NRo.  For details see the mailing list.  If you have items that you want to sell, bring them, or more importantly, <a href="mailto:templars@sporga.rxn.com">email them</a> to the list so we know what we have</p>

<p><b>Raids:</b></p>

<p>First, Friday night.  We'll have a guild meeting st 5:30pm PDT and then head to Mistmoore.  There are MANY quest items available for many classes in Mistmoore, so our plans are to get some of those for everyone.  The meeting will be kept fairly short and primarily deal with making sure we're ready for Mistmoore and the Saturday night raid, and also talk about and make firm plans for the Guild auction that Axil has proposed.  The Council and the Knights are working out some details for this, but I have to say, after Axil's lengthy explanation in email, I'm really looking forward to something like this.</p>

<p>Our plans for an Efreeti raid this coming Saturday were slightly waylaid by the fact that two other guilds had already made plans to be there.  We're not sure yet if we could still slip in there, but we have come up with a backup plan in case we can.  And that plan is Kedge Keep.  The zone is 35+, so it will actually allow a few more members to participate.  Start time is still 5pm PDT, and since we'll be in Mistmoore the night before, Kedge might actually be easier.</p>

<p>See you all there!</p>
