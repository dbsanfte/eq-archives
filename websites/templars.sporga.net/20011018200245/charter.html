<p><font color="#BCD0E7" size="4" face="Arial" ><b>Charter</b></font><br>
<font size="2" face = "Arial" ><i>Current as of 11/13/99</i></font></p>

<p align = "center"><font face = "Arial"><b><i>Roleplaying</i></b></font></p>
<p><font face = "Arial">Roleplaying is strongly encouraged.  Carrying the anon or roleplay tag is also encouraged but not necessary. Your actions and abilities will tell people around you who and what you are.  Of course, others will still ask, but whenever feasible stay in character or use /ooc when you're not.  Try to avoid non-in-character comments when /saying or /shouting, at the very least.</font></p>

<p align = "center"><font face = "Arial"><b><i>Aiding Other Travellers</i></b></font></p>
<p><font face = "Arial">As with the mission of the original Templars, aid travelers in need.  That is, whenever (and I mean whenever) other characters get in over their heads and you as a guild member are capable of helping them without surely dying yourself, you should attempt to provide help.  If this means giving up a campsite for a brief period, then do so.  In addition to saving lives, Templars do no charge a fee to someone in need of a bind.  Donations may be accepted, but never asked for.</font></p>

<p align = "center"><font face = "Arial"><b><i>Trade Skills</i></b></font></p>
<p><font face = "Arial">Members are encouraged to use guild resources and communication to trade recipes and sources for armor, arrows, brewing, etc., and to make the most of their trade skills.  This sort of thing should be kept within the guild -- trade secrets, so to speak.  Prices should be discussed within the guild so that guild members aren't undercutting each other and competing with each other.  This may also aid in being more competitive with merchant players outside the guild.  The guild should also be used as a resource for transporting rare raw materials (sharpening stones, bow parts, pelts) to other parts of Norrath where they are in short supply.  Members should also pay attention to the local markets where ever they are.  If supplies are in obviously short supply (arrows in Ro), this information should be passed to other guild members that could fill that needed shortage.</font></p>

<p align = "center"><font face = "Arial"><b><i>Quests</i></b></font></p>
<p><font face = "Arial">Guild members will assist other members in helping to fulfill quests, while to other non-member players perhaps only regular Hints can be given.  This does not mean we are to give each other details on the quests, just that we will point people in the right direction.  Guild members should also expect and provide active participation in the form of physically assisting other guild members in completing tough quests by providing muscle.  This assistance should stay with the &quot;No Twinking&quot; restrictions below.</font></p>

<p align = "center"><font face = "Arial"><b><i>The Don'ts</i></b></font></p>
<p><font face = "Arial">No Kill Stealing allowed, no being an asshole, and twinking is Strongly discouraged (that's why several of us moved to the new server, after all).  A good logical limit to twinking is as follows:  If the character that is to receive an item cannot get actual exp in the pursuit of the item, they have no business having that item.  Another way to look at it is to use the inherent level limits that limit level discrepancies when forming groups.  A level 14 character cannot gain experience when grouped with characters levels 20-24, therefore, a level 14 should not get physical assistance from level 20-24 characters in order to complete a quest or get an item.</font></p>  

<hr>
<p align = "center"><font face = "Arial"><b><i>Before You Join</i></b></font></p>
<p><font face = "Arial">Just to make sure that new members have read the charter, I will ask them for a password to finalize their membership.  That password is:  &quot;Gilgamesh&quot;.</font></p>
