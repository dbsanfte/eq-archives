<p>What follows is Master Darkini's account of his quest to help the monk Vaalon the Calm.</p>

<p>&quot;It all started out a normal every day in Norrath, I was heading past the
dwarf town of Kaladim to catch one of those lovely sea faring vessels to
travel to Freeport as I had promised a younger guild mate some treasures I
had received thus far in my adventures.  After passing the entrance to
Kaladim I stopped as I saw a monk by the name of Vaalon the Calm walking
towards me in a cream robe with runes all over it.  It was a wonderful
sight and I was struck with awe.</p>

<p>&quot;He hailed me, but I was still too
stunned to say anything, so he hailed me again, this time I managed to get
a hail in before he walked off. 'Hail my friend, can you help me with a
quest?' were the very next words he said.  I was again stumbling for
something to say but managed to get out a nod and asked how I may help. 
He informed me & another companion that had also joined, by the name of
Padraic that he was sent by his master to retrieve a book called Thae
Khom, it seems the actual name has escaped me now, I was not able to
process everything at once.  I asked who had the book & he informed us
that he was just told that a Skunk had it here in the mountains of
Butcherblock, I informed him that there were many skunks around this area
& that I hoped we would not need to kill them as my god Quellious forbid
me from killing innocent creatures.  He informed me that he too was a
follower of Quellious and did not believe in harming the creatures.</p>

<p>&quot;We continued on a bit further and there along the wall of one of the
mountains was a Skunk called Xai Fai Long, and two of his guards it
seemed, Skunk Sentry & Skunk Avatar.  There was already a few people
gathering around the skunks trying to find out who they were.  THe monk,
myself & the Shaman (Padraic) approached the skunks and asked for the book
which the monk had been seeking.  The skunks asked that we proved our
worth to them and retrieve an native artifact from the evil orcs at
Crushbone or from the undead at Unrest.  We asked if they could give us
any more information but they said what they had give was enough.  They
then suggested we take one more with us as the monk was forbidden from
helping us in our quest.  There was a noble cleric standing nearby so we
invited him to join, he had just begun his journeys and was only in his
4th season wheras I was in my 26th and the Shaman his 24th.</p>

<p>&quot;We proceeded
to orcs stronghold at Crushbone, there were many nobles around
slaughtering the evil orcs and it seemed we may not find the item we
seeked.  Alas our monk realised that the slavers dropped some slave keys
that were a rare item from those parts and suggested we try them.  WE
headed to where the slaves were being kept and waited for the Orc Slavers
to show up, they seemed to be in hiding as it took quite some time for
them to show up. The fighting was quick and painless as the Slavers proved
no problem for myself & the shaman, but we needed to help out our fellow
cleric in more instances than not as he was very young and would die very
quickly at the hands of the orcs.  Within a few hours we had accumulated 3
keys and a belt from the slavers.  THe monk informed us that this should
be enough and that we should head back and see if the Skunks acept these.</p>

<p>&quot;The journey back was quick and we were excited to see whether the monk
would receive his book.  Upon arrival a huge crowd had gathered and the
lead Skunk Xia Fan Long had many people nearby crowding him and we could
not get close to him.  He asked everyone to make way for us as he needed
to speak to us and slowly the crowd made room.  THe was however one
person, another monk by the name of Arusien that kept running around the
skunk and I believe annoying the skunk.  Then with one quick flick of the
skunks tail the monk was dead, I felt sorry for the poor monk for not
listening, but I feel he has learnt a valuable leason.  Vaalon gave the
keys & belt to the skunk and he accepted it greatfully, he then called for
me to step forward, which I did most greatful that he had accepted our
items and the monk could now receive his book.</p>

<p>&quot;He said he needed more
proof of our worth and asked if I would sacrifice something to him, I said
it would be an honor to sacrifice something for the aid of Vaalon.  He
asked me to give him my Bronze Breastplate, I was a bit hesitant as that
Breastplate had probably saved my life on quite a few occassions, but I
knew Vaalon needed his book more than I needed that armor so I handed it
over.  Within a few seconds he handed back to me the armor again, I
thought it was not a good enough sacrifice but he merely said, your
sacrifce was great & you have been rewarded as such, that is when I looked
at the armor and low & behold it was not my Bronze one, but a nice
Enamelled Black one, to my estimate this would have give me at least 25
more to my armor capabilities.</p>

<p>&quot;I queried the others with me to see if
they too received such elaborate gifts for their sacrifices, and they too
received wonderful gifts, the shaman received some new leggings that were
blood stained, & the cleric received a new mace it looked like Fine Steel
but I sensed it was Enchanted, the cleric also seemd a little WIser &
Stronger after receiving this item.  After all of us sacrificed our items
Xai Fan Long presented Vaalon with his book, he thanked us quickly and
left as he need to rush it back to his master immediately.</p>

<p>&quot;After that we
had many people asking us what was going on and so we spent a bit of time
talking to people about it and showing our new items to passers by.  It
was truely a marvelous day.  One I shall never forget.&quot;</p>
