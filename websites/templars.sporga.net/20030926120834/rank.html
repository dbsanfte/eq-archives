<h2>Guild titles/ranks</h2>

<p>What follows comes from an email I sent to the Council for discussion.  It is a working document, meaning it may change.  But this is what we are using now for the base of our rank system.  If you have any comments or suggestions, they are <b>welcome</b>.  Sent them to me via <a href="mailto:whit0215@tc.umn.edu">email</a></p>

<hr>

<p>I've been thinking about this for a while, and basically I'm unpleased with the automatic promotions.  I believe a more subjective system would be more apporpriate to promote whatever ideals we want as a guild.  So instead of a lvl/time based system, what I would like to do us use the Charter as a measuring stick for people's positions within the guild (you may want to review the charter).  And I would also like to say that I think the bulk of members should be Sergents, with a small percentage of Knights within the guild.  That may not be realistic as everyone advances in the guild.  I'm thinking 10% Knights at this point, which leaves about 80% Sergents, and about 10% for Masters and Squires.</p>

<p>Here are the criteria I think we should use. </p>
<dl>
	<dt><b>Squire</b>
		<dd>All new members enter the guild as Squires.  They should stay that way for a minimum of 3 weeks of active play to allow us the time to get to know them.  After the 3 weeks, their status will automatically be reviewed by the council for promotion to the rank of Sergent.

	<dt><b>Sergent</b>
		<dd>Sergents simply do not do anything that puts the guild in a bad light, and do not do anything completely counter to the charter.  That means that they are perhaps allowed a number of... I don't know what to call them... disgressions, or actions counter to the charter.  But basicaly, their heart is in the right place, at least when the get promoted.  While we let lvl 8's join the guild, Sergents should be at
least lvl 10.

	<dt><b>Knight</b>
		<dd>Knights embody the charter.  That means they know and follow every point of the charter, with the possible exception of the roleplaying point.  Everyone lets that one slide to differing degrees.  So, this includes being helpful, being nice, sharing trade skill information and help, actively going to help guildmates with quests and things, and no twinking or KSing.  Knights should be at least lvl 20, though that will rapidly be passed by most members shortly.  <br>
</dl>

<p>Nominations for Knighthood can be made privately by any Knight or Master.  But the point should not be to have every knight nominate everyone that isn't a knight.  There should be some sort of repercussions if the nomination is rejected.  Don't nominate on a whim.</p>

<p>Any promotion requires consensus of the Council of Masters.  If the nomination does not succeed, then I will talk to the nominee and tell them why.</p>

<p>All characters will be considered individually.  Those members that play two characters should not really get special treatment in the ranking department.</p>

<p>We are also considering a system of Uber-Knights.  The current thinking is that this would be based on accomplishments within the game: Helping kill Vox or Nafagen, killing a Giant, Heroics in saving others through self sacrifice.  These things are Very open to suggestion right now, so feel free....</p>
