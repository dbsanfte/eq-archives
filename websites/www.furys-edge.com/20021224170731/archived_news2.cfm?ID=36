Iksar, 
even
they are discriminated against and abused. Sorthaz, Charansis, Havic,

sorthaz) but
they see little to no praise for it, instead, day after day they endure 
abuse

<p><font color=#00FF00 size=4>Can you imagine people actually 
finding
pleasure in this?! The thought of flaying our lizard guild mates and 
making
wallets out of their skin. This struggle for freedom, for acceptance, 
finally
led Firiona Vie to declare March as <b>IKSAR HISTORY MONTH</b>. Sadly, 
the
creatures of the surrounding areas, The Dreadlands, Frontier Mountains,
Overthere, they would not give up their ancient ways. </font></p>

<p align=left><font color=#00FF00 size=4>But what of Cabilis? 
Ancient 
city
of the Iksar empire, older then Queynos, Freeport, and Neriak put 
together, 
it
was reduced to a ghetto as the Sarnak and Shissar slavers came and 
captured 
the
noble lizards, hauling them off to work in Chardok, in Sebilis, in 
Ssra... 
They
took the brightest minds, the strongest bodies, the largest mana pools 
and 
left
behind the women and children. As Chardok flourished, Cabilis 
crumbled. </font></p>

<p align=left><font color=#00FF00 size=4>Most of the able bodied 
Iksar
left. They joined guilds and pickup groups alike hoping to get 
themselves a
piece of the pie, they heard the roads to antonica were paved with 
gold, and
they wished to prosper. So leaving their homes behind, they began lives 
as
mercenaries. Always the butt of people's jokes, they are humble and 
shy. But 
the
time had come my friends, the time for Fury's Edge to liberate the 
Iksar 
from
those who refused to honor the abolishion of Iksar slavery. We would go 
after
the source of the problem... the slavers.</font></p>
<p align=left><font color=#00FF00 size=4>Ssra is a horrible 
place, I 
don't
think I need to tell you. The Shissar, always dripping venom from their 
fangs,
have love for only two things. Money, and underground fetish snake 
porn. 
They
live, mining ore deep within their temple to buy new DVD and feed their 
twisted
obsession. Deep within their Temple City, they keep Iksar naked and 
shackled,
behind bars of living energy, malnourished and desperate, they cry out 
for a
hand. So, with blades sharpened and eyes wild with anger, the forces of 
FE
converged upon Ssra and promptly began walling mobs in anger. It was 
the 
first
strike in a campaign that would come to be known as:</font></p>

<p align=left><font color=#00FF00 size=4>FECURSELF (Fury's Edge 
Central
Union of Reconnaissance Specializing in Elite Ferreting) has learned 
that 
the
secret to successful Ssra raids is the walls and the pillars. Now, I'm 
sure 
you
ask yourself, SELF, why would Canna tell me the secrets to raiding Ssra 
and
killing the big bosses? Well, its quite simple. FE cant be everywhere 
at all
times, only with the help of the server can we keep Cabilis 
free.</font></p>

<p align=left><font color=#00FF00 size=4>Anger struck us all as 
we
witnessed first hand the abuse of the Shissar, we were the first to 
take 
notice,
but others were quick to join us in our campaign against slavery. In no 
time,
the temple was filled with protesters. Their inspirational songs, 
soulful 
and
deep, sustained us through the night, as we slay the vile snakes. Such
