fetch me a few items that I need for later trades with the followers of Solusek
Ro. I require an Opoline Helm from a Deepwater Goblin and a Mudwater Rune from a
Lizard Fanatic of Cazic Thule. Finally, you will also need to see Garden about

Lambent Helm.&quot;</b></font><br>

Goblins in Oasis of Marr.&nbsp; The goblins spawn in an underwater tower close
to the specters.&nbsp; The goblins are level 33-37.&nbsp; If you get a group of

The next item you need is a Mudwater Rune.&nbsp; These drop quite frequently by
Lizard Fanatics in Temple of Cazic Thule.&nbsp; The are around level
32-35.&nbsp; If you get into a Throne Room group, and you pull from the top
floor, you will get lots of fanatics and one is sure to drop one.&nbsp; Just
make sure your group knows you want it because they are No Drop.&nbsp; Next you
need a Lambent Star Ruby.&nbsp; These are obtained by giving Garden, an NPC is
Temple of Solusek Ro, two Star Rubies and a Lambent Stone.&nbsp; The Star Rubies are
purchased by jewelry vendors for approximately 60-70 platinum depending on your
Charisma.&nbsp; The Lambent Stone can be bought from players for the low price
of around 30 platinum, or you can get them off of giants and griffins.</b></font></p>
