<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Reania Jukle: 'Ink of the Dark, you say?
That isn't an everyday item, you know. In fact i can't remember the last time
someone requested it. I have given up keeping any here with me. You are going to
need to find your own supply now. Sorry.'</b></font></p>

<p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Yep!&nbsp; You got it!&nbsp; Rilgor wants
the shiny metallic robes.&nbsp; These robes are dropped off of the Ghoul
Archmagus.&nbsp;
He spawns in the Magi Room.&nbsp; To get there from the Dead Side Zone 1, go
down the small hallway at the zone, turn right and go down another hill.&nbsp;
Run through the small corridor until you come to water.&nbsp; Jump into the
water and swim to the right.&nbsp; You will come up at the bedroom.&nbsp; Take
the passage all</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b> the way to the left.&nbsp; Follow this until you come to a big

follow the wall to the right, past the Greater Ice Bone Skeletons.&nbsp; Until
you come to a group of steps with a bridge.&nbsp; Jump off the bridge to the
left.&nbsp; Go straight down a hallway and you will come to a jail.&nbsp; Keep
going straight down that hallway until you can turn to the right.&nbsp; Turn to
the right and follow that hallway to the magi room.&nbsp; For a map go to <a href="http://www.graffe.com"><font color="#BB3D2F">www.graffe.com</font></a><font color="#BB3D2F">.</font>
The magus is a 30 minutes spawn and has a placeholder which is usually a Kor
Ghoul Wizard or a Dar Ghoul Knight.&nbsp; He spawns 1 every 5 times.&nbsp; So
expect him to spawn once every 2 and a half hours.&nbsp; The rare drop is a
Shiny Metallic Robe which drops 1 every 6 times.&nbsp; If you get up early in
the morning and get into a group there I bet by the end of the day you will have
one.&nbsp; Note that the Shiny Metallic Robe is not no drop and can be purchased
for approximately 7,000 platinum.</b></font></p>

these items and return them to me. Head of a serpent, essence of a ghost,
essence of a vampire, and sands of the mystics. Do so and you will receive the
last of the pieces. Be sure to combine them in a sack first. Just ask and I will
provide you with one.<br>
<br>
'What is the head of a serpent?'<br>
'Serpent is probably not an accurate term form what you must return to me. It is
actually the remnants of a spirit. The spirit is one which was eradicated long
long ago by the Iksar. I believe they were called the Shissar. You may need to
travel to the Iksar city to learn more about these creatures.<br>
<br>
'What is the essence of a ghost?'<br>
'You don't have to look far to find roaming spirits. One in particular though
has more meaning then the other sorry souls trapped here. You see, Kindle was a
dear friend of mine. I came in search of him when he stopped writing. Wel....look
at me now. I fear that I have succumbed to the same fate as poor Kindle.<br>
<br>
'What is the essence of a vampire?'<br>
'The essence of a vampire is just that. Only the most powerful of these
creatures will possess what you need.<br>
<br>
'What sands of the mystics?'<br>
'They are sands that were imbued with the magical might of the mystics. Mystics
use a ritual involving their own blood to create a powerful bond with the sand.
One will need to search the shores.</b></font></p>

off of The Ghost of Kindle in The Hole.&nbsp; She can be found in the Undead Tower.&nbsp;
There are a few other spawns in here such as reavers.&nbsp; They are all non
aggressive except for the reavers unless you attack them which you will have to do.&nbsp; You must kill
The Ghost of Kindle and the two reavers.&nbsp; On her corpse will be Essence of
Ghost.</b></font></p>

temple.&nbsp; </b></font><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">The Shissar herself is 
actually extremely easy to kill.&nbsp; The hard part is getting to her.&nbsp; 
You basically have to clear the whole Plane, and then pull her from the temple.&nbsp;

your guild.</font></b></p>

sticks are Wizard Lure spells.&nbsp; He hits for about 230.</b></font></p>

that Essence of Vampire is a rare drop so it will take a long time to do this.</b></font></p>
