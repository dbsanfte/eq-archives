dragons.&nbsp; The first guts drops from Eldrig the Old.&nbsp; He is a rare
spawn drake in Skyfire Mountains.&nbsp; Its drops Chromodrac guts which are the
guts you&nbsp; need.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font>
</b></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#000000"><b> The next guts are dropped from Nezekezena, a named
dragon level 51 in the Burning Woods.&nbsp; Reports indicate that if you go to
Nezekezena's spawn location (about -450, -2550 in Burning Wood) and kill
everything in sight, eventually Nez or his (her?) placeholders will start
spawning with a cycle time of 90 seconds. People have evidenced acquiring
Burning Embers at a rate of 1 or 2 in a few hours' time with this method.
Phurzikan and Nezekezna both spawn on this spot, and they are both strong;
sometimes Nez or Phurz will spawn two times in a row, so your group had better
be strong enough to take them.&nbsp; Nezekezena, if not killed when she spawns,
will wander sometimes along the east and south walls of the zone, so if you
can't find her near her spawn, look there. A tracker would definitely help.&nbsp;
The guts you need from her are red wurm guts.&nbsp; The best way to do this 
camp, is have someone in your guild with an extra computer bring a ranger to the 
zone.&nbsp; Then continually track for a week or so until you get it on track.&nbsp; 
Phurzikan drops a very nice resistance shoulder called wurm scale coat.&nbsp; 
This might be a good way to convince people to help you camp these two dragons.<br>
<br>
The last guts are dropped from Blackwing in Rathe Mountains.&nbsp; This is a
level 35-40 dragon identical to the other drakes.&nbsp; To get him to spawn,
kill all lizards, drakes, etc. that are close to the sphinx.&nbsp; He will spawn
shortly.&nbsp; He has around 1400-1900 hitpoints. He drops huge onyx drake guts.</b></font></p>

You must get talk to Forpar Fizfla.&nbsp; You must complete three quests for
him.&nbsp; After each quest he will reward you will part of the  lute.&nbsp; He
can usually be found in the middle windmill.</b></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#000000"><b>The First Quest is for the Head
and Neck of the lute.&nbsp; Go to Vedico Windwisper in the Butcherblock
Mountains.&nbsp; She is on the docks.&nbsp; She asks that you bring the Alluring
Horn.&nbsp; This horn is dropped off of Quag Maelstrom.&nbsp; He is a level 45
mob in Ocean of Tears, only one zone away from Vedico.&nbsp; The following
information was cited by an anonymous person on Illia's Beastiary. He's
generally on the Seafury Cyclops island around -6000, 1000. He conned red to me
at 42 and he casts drain mana a lot, (which curiously did not appear to lower my
bardic mana bar at all). I was able to land a lot of Chants of Flame and
Curtailing Chants so his fire/magic resistances may not be that high. He didn't
hit me all that much, but if memory serves he was hitting me for around 100 or
120 per shot.&nbsp; He's generally seen wielding this odd weapon which looks
like a thin tree trunk skewering the alluring horn he carries, which tends to
make him stand out from the others. There are a good number of cyclopses on the
small island, so pulling Quag alone isn't easy. But sometimes he stomps over to
the shore by himself (to look in the water I guess). I don't know if he spawns
all the time, or if you have to trigger his spawn by talking to the disgruntled
elf at the BB docks. I went to talk to the elf first just in case, and by the
time I got to the island Quag was there, and didn't despawn over the several
hours I took to gauge the island and set up my offensive.</b></font></p>

Vedico and she will give you a note to give to give to Forpar.&nbsp; When you

Backbone of an Ancient Fisherman or Phinigel's Spine.&nbsp; It is found off of
the Phinigel Autropos in Kedge
Keep.&nbsp; The Phinigel
Autropos is a level 50 Wizard.&nbsp; He can be taken out with 1 well structured 
55+ group.&nbsp; He enjoys dispelling people (usually your
enduring breath.)&nbsp; His guardians are level 51. He is mezzable, his 
guardians are not, and they can complete heal. With new gear, a group of 5 
people can easily do this, as long as you have one level 60 to pull (only lvl 
60s can get him solo.)</b></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#000000"><b>The second thing is a Amalgym
Tentacle or Amalgym Tendril.&nbsp; These are 9/25 1h slashing weapons that drop
from Amalgym Warriors and Knights in Plane of Fear.&nbsp; They are both level
48-52 but the knights can heal, summon pets, and harmtouch.</b></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#000000"><b>The third thing is a Petrified
Skull of Lycanthrope or petrified werewolf skull.&nbsp; This is dropped from the
Drolvarg Warlord in Karnor's Castle.&nbsp; This is a level 51-54 Drolvarg who
spawns in the Warlord room.</b></font></p>

Dragon Scale.&nbsp; This is most commonly dropped by Lord Nagafen, a level 55 dragon in Nagafen's Lair but can also be found off of Zordakilicus
Ragefire in Skyfire,
or Talendor in Skyfire.&nbsp; There is also a mob in The Hole named Nortlav the
Scalekeeper.&nbsp; He is a level 51-55 Erudite that drops the Red Dragon Scale.&nbsp; He hits for about 190 on average.&nbsp; He has a nasty harmtouch
that does around 1500 damage.&nbsp; He also uses harmtouch, and has a high magic
resist.&nbsp; Wizard spells Ice Comet and the Lure Line will stick.&nbsp;

thing.&nbsp; Trakanon's Guts.&nbsp; These drop off of a clone of Trakanon.&nbsp;
He is exactly the same except he always drops the guts.&nbsp; To get him to
spawn, go to Trak's lair while he is not spawned.&nbsp; Give the body of the
lute to An Undead Bard which spawns about 18 hours after a normal Trakanon is 
killed. &nbsp; He will hand it back to you and then attack
you.&nbsp; He is level 55 monster.&nbsp; Once he is killed, the clone of Trakanon will spawn.&nbsp; Trakanon claws for 650, with a sickening melee range,
and his breath attack has been known to kill whole groups in minutes.&nbsp;
Reports say that the regular Trakanon doesn't drop the guts.&nbsp; You have to 
kill him this way but this has not yet been confirmed.&nbsp; Now give Forpar the 
Trakanon Guts, the Head and Neck of the Lute (One Item) and the Body of the Lute
