dialogue with the <span class="SpellE">NPCs</span> for this segment is pretty 
funny. He will give you the receipt for the bowl if you do a job for him.&nbsp; Bring 
this grocery list to Merchant Nora in the Shop of All Halos in
<span class="SpellE">Felwithe</span> north, which is near the cleric guild. She 
gives you in return a bag of Provisions. Bring it to <span class="SpellE">Farios</span>

barbarians to stun him when he starts to cast a spell. KK is a rough zone, bring 
lots of scales for Enduring Breath or get an EB item like a fishbone

island is the one with a mage spell vendor in a tower. The next island to the

cyclops. You can pull them to the shore or other island until a Tainted spawns.

Gorilla is mid-40s and spawns in the Emerald Jungle in the northern part of the 
plateau. Take the giant stairs on the western side of the zone and then head 
north from the stairs, to the zone wall.&nbsp;Tottering Gorillas are its placeholder. 
Only pull Tottering Gorillas, the rest are pointless. The best way to get the 
gorilla is to use <span class="SpellE">invis</span> to get around, track them 
down and pull to the northern zone wall away from other mobs.&nbsp;Make sure that

<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Verdana"><font size="2">The second monster, 
Corrupted Barracuda, is found in the main lake of Lake of Ill Omen at around 
-900, -900.&nbsp; Same old story here, kill the placeholder, a Deepwater Barracuda, 
until the Tainted spawns. Placeholders are on a 10 minute timer and this will 
consume many boring hours. You can determine if the Tainted Barracuda will spawn 
the Corrupted very easily. Exit the water. If it follows you onto land, that 
Tainted WILL spawn the Corrupted. If it doesn't follow you, it won't spawn the 
Corrupted, but you still have to kill it anyway. The Tainted that comes on land 
is significantly tougher than the other barracudas and you will need help, like 
a <span class="SpellE">necro</span> to fear kite. </font>
<o:p><font size="2">&nbsp;Kill him and get the Pure Lakewater.</font></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Verdana"><font size="2">The last, final and 
toughest mob in this whole ordeal is the dragon <span class="SpellE">Faydedar</span> 
in Timorous Deep.&nbsp; He's really small for a dragon and looks like a lowland 
basilisk in Butcherblock, but don't be fooled.&nbsp; He is at least level 53 and hits 
rapidly <span class="GramE">for up to 250 damage and has major magic resist</span>.&nbsp; 
His spawn spot is in an oasis at the very southern end of Timorous Deep. Take 
the boat from the Oasis dock to Timorous and have a 57 or higher wizard evacuate 
you to Chess Island, or just levitate and run there.&nbsp; A better deal is the necro 
spell Dead Man Floating, since it gives you levitate AND lets you breathe under 
water. From there the oasis is to the southeast.&nbsp;Don't go straight south because 
you'll hit Raptor Island and the agro range of those raptors is ridiculous.</font></span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Verdana"><font size="2">The entrance is at 
approximately -11300, -3500. It's a large mountain range with a hidden cove. On 
the far eastern side is an underwater cavern. Swim in and you come up in an 
inside ring, with yet a second circular area to enter, like a circle within a 
circle. The second entrance is on the north side of the inside ring.&nbsp; So when 
you get inside, go right and follow the inside wall, so it's on your left. There 
is a second underwater entrance that will bring you into the lagoon. You can get 
an idea from the <a href="http://www.eqatlas.com/kunark/timorousdeepmap.html">
<span style="COLOR: #bb3d2f">map</span></a> at EQAtlas.&nbsp; </font></span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Verdana"><font size="2">The tactics are: load up 
with about four or five useless, dummy buffs like see invisible, save vs. 
poison, etc. THEN put on your good buffs. He will dispel you several times, so 
let the garbage buffs go first. You need as high fire and magic resist as 
possible, those are his main weapons. Get all the fire and magic resist gear you 
can and have a bard to twist Psalm of Mystic Shielding and Psalm of Cooling. 
Also, remove SoW and turn run to walk. He WILL fear people. If you are SoWed and 
running you will go quite a distance. Never, under any circumstances, should a 
caster sit to med when they go OOM. You will be summoned and killed. Last, never 
heal yourself. Have someone else do it.</font></span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Verdana"><font size="2">When you go to trigger him, 
have the casters hiding in the second tunnel that leads into the oasis. This 
will keep them out of range of the AoEs and Dragon Roar. Take the tanks with you 
to the shore where you will see a dwarf fisherman named Dolgin Codslayer. Give 
him the Froglok Essence you got from Ulump. Dolgin will give it back to you and 
depop. This triggers Fay. Have the tanks melee him down to 80 or 70 percent,
<span class="GramE">then</span> bring in the casters from the tunnel to nuke him 
and start healing the tanks. His magic resists are very high, but cold spells 
and wizard lures can stick, as will Tashan. But to be honest, lots of tanks and 
lots of clerics really are the tactic here. Casters won't be much help except 
wizards for lures and enchanters to haste the tanks. Kill him and loot the Pod 
of Seawater.</font></span></p>
