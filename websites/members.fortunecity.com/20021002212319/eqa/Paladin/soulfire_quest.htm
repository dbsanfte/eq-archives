<p align="center"><font size="6" face="Verdana"><b>SoulFire Quest</b></font></p>
<p align="center"><u><font face="Verdana" size="4"><b>The Start</b></font></u></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>The quests starts in North
Freeport in the Hall of Truth.&nbsp; Find Kalatrina Plossen, one of the Greatest
Paladins in the Land.&nbsp; She is directly above the entrance on the second
floor.&nbsp; Hail her and she will say:</b></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>&quot;Hail! Welcome to the Hall
of Truth.&nbsp; We, the Knights of Tunare, are the hope this city has of
loosening the grip of Lucan D'lere and his militia.&nbsp; I seek a young knight
to [serve the will of the Truthbringer.]&nbsp;</b></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Respond: &quot;I serve the will
of the Truthbringer&quot;&nbsp;</b></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>&quot;Stand tall then, Knight!&nbsp;
We have need of your service.&nbsp; We have sent a man to infiltrate the
militia.&nbsp; We fear he may soon be found out.&nbsp; Take him this note of
warning.&nbsp; Say the words, 'Truth is good,' and you shall find him.&nbsp; Be
careful, young knight.&nbsp; The militia does not take prisoners.&quot;</b></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Continue talking to her using the keywords to get her to continue
speaking and you will learn of a spy in the Militia.&nbsp; He is in danger
Kalatrina tells you and you have to take a note to him.&nbsp; He is located at
the Freeport Militia House.&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></font></p>
<p align="center"><b><u><font face="Verdana" size="4">The Spy</font></u></b></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Hurry over to the House.&nbsp;
The spy is in the middle of the Militia House in the Courtyard on the first
floor.&nbsp; Hail him and he will warn you of danger.&nbsp; Then give him the
note from Kalatrina.&nbsp; The Militia will then jump him and kill him.&nbsp;
Before he dies he gives you an old piece of burned parchment and yells for you
to take it to Kalatrina.&nbsp; Run back to Kalatrina and give her the note.</b></font></p>
<p align="center"><b><u><font face="Verdana" size="4">The Note</font></u></b></p>
<p align="left"><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Kalatrina is excited by the
note you have been given. Do <u>not</u>&nbsp;give Kalatrina Plossen the Note. If
you do, restart the Quest and get it again. This is where the Quest is
counter-intuitive. If you give her the Note, she tells you Zimel was a great
Blacksmith who knew the secret of enchanting blades and making superior weapons.
This is a bug in the Quest.&nbsp; Do <u>not</u> give her the note and carry it
with you.&nbsp; She sends you to talk to Rashinda Elore who is located at the
Office of the People.&nbsp; Ask her , &quot;Have you heard of Zimel's
Blades?&quot; and she will start giving tons of information.&nbsp; After lots of
talk she suggests that you go ask Groflah Steadirt about him because Groflah was
a friend of Zimel.</font></b></p>
<p align="center"><b><u><font face="Verdana" size="4">Groflah Steadirt</font></u></b></p>
<p align="left"><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Go to Groflah's Forge and find
Groflah.&nbsp; He is on the second floor.&nbsp; Ask him about Zimel.&nbsp; He
doesn't really comfortable about talking about him.&nbsp; Then, give him the
note that the spy gave to you.&nbsp; He will start mumbling how this could have
survived the fire.&nbsp; Then he says to meet him at Seafarers and gives you the
note back.</font></b></p>
<p align="center"><b><u><font face="Verdana" size="4">Finding More on Zimel</font></u></b></p>
<p align="left"><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Go to the Seafarers and wait
until about 1-3 am.&nbsp; He should then show up.&nbsp; Ask him about Zimel's
Blades again and give him the note.&nbsp; He will go into a long story about how
Zimel has disappeared and the Blade, Soulfire has been lost. Hand Groflah the
Note and he attempt to decipher it. Groflah tells you that he thinks Sir Lucan
D'Lere, Head of the Freeport Militia, and Pietro Zarn, Head of the ShadowKnight
Guild in Freeport are in cahoots and searching for Soulfire as well.</font></b></p>
<p align="center"><b><u><font face="Verdana" size="4">Tykar Renlin</font></u></b></p>
<p align="left"><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Now, look around Seafarers
Roost for a beggar named Tykar.&nbsp; He says that he is thirsty so buy him a
Drom's Champagne.&nbsp; Repeat this three times and then ask him again about
Zimel.&nbsp; He will tell you that he saw Zimel thrown into a dungeon and locked
up.&nbsp; He then gives you a blanket to give to Zimel because he feels sorry
for him.</font></b></p>
<p align="center"><b><u><font face="Verdana" size="4">Zimel</font></u></b></p>
<p align="left"><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Go to the dungeon below the
arena and search for &quot;Zimel&quot; who's NPC name shows up as &quot;a
prisoner&quot;.&nbsp; (Thought to be in Cell Number
4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After talking to him you can tell that he wants a blanket
(which you have), bog juice (made from brewing), and edible goo (made from
cooking and purchasable in bakeries.)&nbsp; Hand him the three items and you
will get a key labeled &quot;H.K. 102&quot;</font></b></p>
<p align="center"><b><u><font face="Verdana" size="4">High Keep</font></u></b></p>
<p align="left"><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Run to HighKeep and give the
Bank Clerk the key.&nbsp; She thanks you and gives you a note to give to Brother
Hayle who is being held prisoner in Splitpaw.&nbsp; Go to Splitpaw (zone in
South Karanas) and find Brother Hayle.&nbsp; Give him the note from the Bank
Clerk.&nbsp; He says he will give you the SoulFire if you get him the Hilt of
Soulfire, the Brilliant Sword of Faith, your Testimony, and hand in the this
note which he just gave back to you.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></b></p>
<p align="center"><b><u><font face="Verdana" size="4">The Hilt</font></u></b></p>
<p align="left"><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">The Hilt of SoulFire is being
held by Xicotl, an evil Shadow Knight in Mistmoore.&nbsp; He is level 40 and
drops the hilt every time.&nbsp; He spawns around the spa and throne room.&nbsp;
His spawn is very random so just kill everything you see in hopes of finding
him.&nbsp;&nbsp;His placeholder is a mistmoore guard.</font></b></p>
<p align="center"><b><u><font face="Verdana" size="4">The Sword</font></u></b></p>
<p align="left"><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">The Sword is found through a
sub-quest.&nbsp; You have to first get a big group of people together.&nbsp;
They should be level 40-60.&nbsp; Then go to the Freeport Militia and kill Sir
Lucan (level 48).&nbsp; He and his friends put up a very good fight.&nbsp; You
have to kill him twice, once the actual him and the other time his
reincarnation.&nbsp; Loot the testimony from him and give it to Valeron in the
Hall of Truth at Freeport.&nbsp; She will give you the Brilliant Sword of Faith.</font></b></p>
<p align="center"><b><u><font face="Verdana" size="4">Your Testimony</font></u></b></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>To get your Testimony, first
speak to Merko in the Hall of Truth. He'll give you a note to give to Altunic
Jartin in East Commons.&nbsp; Wait in Altunic's house for him to appear, and
give him the note.&nbsp; His house is near the last inn before West Commons.
Walk outside, and fight Squire Narl. He should be extremely easy. After killing
him and getting his head, go buy a cloth shirt from one of the merchants in the
commons.&nbsp; Give the head to Altunic, then give him the shirt, to get a Token
of Generosity.&nbsp; Buy (Or fight for) a Spider Venom Sack, and return to Merko.
Tell him you've earned the Token of Generosity, and he'll ask you for the sack.
Give it to him, and get the Token of Bravery.&nbsp; Then hand in both tokens,
one at a time, to get your final task.&nbsp; This is very important, you must
move very quickly to the sewer, where the canoe is, and to the left is Guard
Willia. If you hesitate at all, Willia will run away, and you will lose your
chance. Guard Willia will plead with you to not kill him/her, and will try to
run away. The words [Freeport Militia] will appear in the paragraph, and if you
try to say something, they will be long gone. If anyone gets to say anything to
the Guard, please tell me what they say, if anything. I would guess the Guard is
about 12th level or so, a little harder than a desert tarantula. After killing
the Guard, you loot the body for a &quot;Token of Truth&quot;. If Guard Willia
runs away, he/she will say, &quot;Thank you for letting me go. I promise to
change my ways...Maybe!&quot;&nbsp; The reward for turning in the Token of Truth
is 3 gold and your testimony.&nbsp; </b></font></p>

<p align="center"><b><u><font face="Verdana" size="4">The End</font></u></b></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Hand in the Hilt, the Sword, your Testimony,
and the Note to Brother Hayle.&nbsp; Before doing this, you must have good 
enough faction with Brother Hayle&nbsp; (Ally faction required).&nbsp; In return you will receive the
legendary SoulFire.&nbsp; If you forget to turn in the note the first time by
itself alone in the Highkeep section, then when you turn in four item, you will
get the note back.&nbsp; Hand in the note for Soulfire.</b></font></p>
