<p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Find Kurron Ni, in the Overthere
Outpost.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">You say, 'hail Kurron Ni'</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2"><br>
Kurron Ni says 'Out of my way, stranger, I am on a delicate mission. Interfere
with my search and I shall relieve you of your head! Bother me no more.<br>
<br>
You say, 'What do you seek?'</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2"><br>
Kurron Ni says 'I have traveled here in hopes of finding a soul worthy of
assisting me in completing my mission.<br>
<br>
You say, 'I am worthy'</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2"><br>
Kurron Ni says 'I doubt it, but I have been wrong before. Before I share with
you the details of my mission, however, you must first prove your worthiness.
Agreed?<br>
<br>
You say, 'Agreed'</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2"><br>
Kurron Ni says 'Very well then, my new friend. I have an acquaintance that
stands in need of three pieces of Darkforge Armor. He requires the breast,
greaves and helm to complete his set. I also must pay back a loan that has come
due in the amount of 900 platinum. Return this to me and I shall share with you
my dark mission, and the immeasurable reward that will be earned at its
completion. Show your face here without fulfilling my request and I will offer
you on the altar to Innoruuk himself. Be off!</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">The Darkforge Armor items are all seperate 
quests.&nbsp; For the Breastplate you need Decayed Mail and Decayed Breastplate, 
and 2 bars of enchanted platinum.&nbsp; The two decayed pieces of armor are 
dropped in Feerott.&nbsp; All you need to do it get a big group of
people around the temple.&nbsp; Then split up into groups and kill
everything.&nbsp; You will probably come across at least one decayed mail and
decayed breastplate.&nbsp; The two bars of enchanter platinum you can get from
enchanters.&nbsp; For the Greaves you need Decayed Left Legplate, Decayed Right
Legplate, and two bricks of Melatite.&nbsp; The decayed is dropped in Ferrott and the Melatite is dropped off of clockwords in Solusek A.&nbsp;
People can be found selling them for 50pp.&nbsp; For the Helm you need Decayed
Helm, Decayed Visor, and two Freeport Militia Helms.&nbsp; Freeport Militia
Helms can be gotten rather easily by sneaking into East Freeport and waiting for
the guard that walks by the dock (provided no one is camping the guards by the
gates). He is pretty low, and is far enough away from other guards that, as long
as you have him darknessed and kill fairly quickly, he won't aggro any others.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Take the three items plus 900 platinum and
give it to Kurron Ni.&nbsp; He will respond:</font></b></p>
<p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Kurron Ni says 'Well done, {your name} , I honestly didn't expect
to see you again. Yes, yes, this is perfect! My mission is nearly complete!</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">You say, 'What mission?'</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Kurron Ni says 'My mission was to find a
pathetic shadowknight and bring him closer to Innoruuk. You volunteered. By
exercising my superior powers of persuasion, I have now taken from you a fine
suit of armor and enough coin to ensure that I will be sleeping neither soberly
nor alone for quite some time! Now I ask you, worthy shadowknight, do you not
feel the fires of hatred coursing through your veins like never before? That is
the very reward I spoke of! You have been brought closer to my master. My
mission is complete! You foolish excuse for a dark knight, I shall take your
head and tell all of your generous donation to the mighty Teir'Dal rogues!</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">At this point Kurron Ni will start attacking
you.&nbsp; He is a level 55 rogue and resistant to all spells except for disease
and poison DoTs, and the Wizard Lure Spells.&nbsp; You will need around one
group of level 50-60 players.&nbsp; You might want to bring more because you
definitely do not want to die on this part of the quest.</font></b></p>

Innoruuk that you have made some breakthrough in your research. Please update me
as to your progress. In the meanwhile I have run into some unexpected expenses
and will need some funds to carry on. An additional ten thousand should suffice.<br>

unfortunate. I was informed last week of the death of my most recent apprentice.
A few months ago, I paid a substantial sum to a group of rogues sent from Neriak
to collect on a gambling debt. He swore to me that was the end of it, but I
suspected otherwise. My warnings of gambling with the rogues fell on deaf ears.

<p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Duriek Bloodpool says 'Thank you. Now,
quickly, there is not much time for me. What I tell you here now must never be
shared with another soul. I have spent the better part of my life piecing
together clues for the creation of a legendary dark blade, a corrupted Ghoulbane.
I am very close to understanding the method used in manipulating the
enchantments of the Ghoulbane, but in my current condition, I cannot finish
collecting the research. My previous apprentice was searching for this last clue
when he met his untimely demise.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">You say, 'where was he searching?'</font></b></p>
<p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Duriek Bloodpool says 'I possess a key that
will open a sealed tome to be found somewhere in the ruins uncovered here not
long ago. Recover that tome for me and I am certain I will be able to corrupt
the Ghoulbane. My name will be etched in history and you will wield a legend!

Go back to Duriek and give it to him.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Duriek Bloodpool gasps at you in
astonishment, eyes beaming with pride and says, 'You've found it! It seems I
underestimated you. You have succeeded where others failed. I feared it would
never come to pass.' Duriek takes the key from his neck, softly muttering some
words, and places it in a previously unseen keyhole. The book's hinges creak as
Duriek pulls it open. After reading for a few moments, he says, 'It is even
better than I had hoped! It will take me weeks to uncover a portion of what this
book has to offer. But this is what I have been searching for, so many years! At
last I know the items required to corrupt that accursed blade!'</font></b></p>
<p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">You say, 'What items?'</font></b></p>
<p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Duriek Bloodpool says 'I will need the
Ghoulbane, the Soul Leech, the Blade of Abrogation, and the Decrepit Sheath.
Alas, I am far too ill to travel and collect these pieces. I must call upon your
youth and ability again, {your name} . Return to me with these items and I shall
be known throughout history as the greatest grave lord to have walked Norrath

<p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">
The Ghoulbane is a quest. (NEED INFO)&nbsp; The Soul Leech is
dropped from Cazic-Thule himself.&nbsp; He has the ability to
harmtouch (his harmtouch essentially kills anyone) anyone in the zone, no matter
how far they are.&nbsp; He is pretty hard to kill unless you have a strong guild
and to make this even harder, Soul Leech is a rare drop!&nbsp; The Blade of
Abrogation is dropped by various mobs within Plane of Air.&nbsp; The Decrepit
Sheath is a separate quest started by Teydar in the Qeynos Aqueducts.&nbsp;</font></b></p>

<p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Teydar says 'The object you desire is very
difficult to fashion, nearly impossible, really. All I can offer to do is try.
The real difficulty is the contents that give the sheath its power. They have to
be of an almost equal evil. I think some kind of decrepit hide, a drake spine
along with a bar of enchanted platinum should prove enough to make this item.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">The decrepit hide is found off of Ashenbone
Drakes in the Plane of Hate.&nbsp; They are level 51-53&nbsp; and are extremely
resistant to magic.&nbsp; They look like a miniature Dracholiche.&nbsp; The
Drake Spine is dropped from Rharzar, a named drake.&nbsp; He is level 55 and is
a cleric who heals himself.&nbsp; You need two full level 50-60 groups.&nbsp; He
is immune to all magic based spells which&nbsp; means that you cannot stun
him.&nbsp; The enchanted bar of platinum can be found off of a fellow
enchanter.&nbsp; Take the three items to Teydar and you will get the Decrepit
Sheath.&nbsp;</font></b></p>
<p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Take the Decrepit Hide, the Drake Spine, and
the enchanted bar of platinum to Teydar.&nbsp; You will get the Decrepit Sheath.</font></b></p>

<p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Teydar says 'I did it! The pieces you got me
were perfect! It took a huge effort on my part to craft this, of course. it
saddens me that I'm unable to keep one of my best works. A deal is a deal. There
is honor among shadowknights.</font></b></p>

places the other swords on either side of it. The sheath begins to gleam so
intensely, you can see the bones inside Duriek's hands. After several minutes,
there is a final, blinding flash. Duriek collapses to the ground. After a few
moments, Duriek motions you closer and whispers, 'You have done well. I wish
fate had been kinder to me and allowed me your aid years ago, I might have lived
long enough to enjoy the fame our combined efforts. I studied much of the tome
you retrieved and have stumbled upon something that may be the key to unleashing
darkness upon the face of Norrath forever. You must seek out a powerful lich by
the name of Lhranc. Farewell, {your name}.' With his last bit of energy, Duriek
places the corrupted Ghoulbane in your hands.</font></b></p>

obscurity. Goodness and purity will spread like a plague across the land and the
servants of Hate will be powerless to stop it!'<br>
<br>
You say, 'What prophecy?'</font></b></p>

<p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Marl Kastane says 'I suppose it is time for
the secret to be shared. Ages ago, two brothers were born. Glohnor was highly
favored by the pompous Lightbringer, whose name we do not utter. Lhranc was
chosen by the Prince of Hate to bring destruction and turmoil to the sons of
men. The one thing they shared in common was their love of the fair priestess,
Kyrenna. Kyrenna fell deeply in love with Glohnor. When Lhranc discovered this,
he was overcome with rage and unwisely attacked his brother, who happened to be
far more adept in combat. The fight cost Lhranc dearly. He lost his dignity as
well as an eye in the struggle. He was ordered to leave Freeport and live his
life in exile from the only home he had ever known.<br>
<br>
You say, 'What became of Lhranc?'</font></b></p>

<p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Marl Kastane says 'Lhranc wandered the
deserts of Ro for weeks, sinking deeper into depression and giving in to rage.
Reports from the local merchants and caravans had him roaming the dunes
muttering to himself incoherently. Eventually, he was forgotten, blending in
with the hermits and madmen common to that region, forgotten by all save one.<br>
<br>
You say, 'Who is the one?'</font></b></p>

<p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Marl Kastane says 'Innoruuk had not forsaken
Lhranc. Once his rage and hate had matured and sufficiently altered his soul,
the dark prince summoned him and gave him dominion over the demons that had
enslaved his mind. He was given a weapon that made him powerful enough to slay
any enemy that stood in his way. He was to become the first human to harness the
power of the almighty shadowknight. After years of traveling and teaching
mankind his newfound abilities, Lhranc sneaked back into Freeport through a
series of sewers in search of revenge against his brother and in hopes of
kidnapping Kyrenna, the source of his obsession. Waiting until Glohnor was
alone, Lhranc sprang from the shadows and slew his brother. This was the act
that brought about his curse.<br>
<br>
You say, 'What curse?'</font></b></p>

<p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Marl Kastane says 'As I said, Glohnor was
highly favored by the Lightbringer. When the contemptible god of honor
discovered what had been done, he transformed Lhranc into a deformed spectral
knight and placed him in the ruined city. Lhranc then used what remained of his
power to summon Kyrenna to his side and bind her there in a timeless, seamless
sphere. He struggled for centuries to break her will and convince her to serve
Innoruuk, certain that together they could remove his curse. But then, there was
the prediction.<br>
<br>
You say, 'What prediction?'</font></b></p>

<p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Marl Kastane says 'The prophecy states that
one day Kyrenna will escape the clutches of Lhranc and that she will resurrect
Glohnor. Together, it reads, they will destroy Lhranc and undo all he has done.
I trust that I do not need to tell you, {Your name} , that this would decimate
our foothold in Norrath. When the prophecy was written, its words spread across
the land. A dark council was held to construct a plan that would frustrate the
words of the prophets. My ancestors were responsible for robbing Glohnor's tomb
and securing his remains. For generations we have been charged with the duty of
guarding those remains and the secret plan, should the corpse be discovered.<br>
<br>
You say, 'What secret plan?'</font></b></p>

<p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Marl Kastane says 'The plan is a last resort
only to be tried if Kyrenna indeed escapes and the remains are discovered.
Judging by my brother's words that time is now. It will take the most powerful
hero all the courage and dedication he can muster to complete the ritual.<br>
<br>
You say, 'I will complete the ritual'</font></b></p>

<p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Marl Kastane says 'It would seem we have no
choice, and this is our only hope. I must first make a dark shroud. To do this I
must stain it with the blood of an innocent. Go find me this rare blood so I can
start the creating of the shroud.</font></b></p>

the items begin to rotate around his head, slowly at first, then faster as the
chanting grows louder, until it spins in a blur. Soon, the room is filled with a
deafening shriek that pierces you to the core.</font></b></p>

said nothing of giving it to you. Feast your eyes on Innoruuk's Curse mortal,
thank you for your service.</font></b></p>

He is level 63 Shadowknight.&nbsp; He harmtouches many times during the fight
and has a buttload of hitpoints.&nbsp; It is impossible to mesmerize him, slow
him, or any other debuffs so have many, many, many clerics ready to use all
their many healing.&nbsp; You will need around 5-6 full groups of level
