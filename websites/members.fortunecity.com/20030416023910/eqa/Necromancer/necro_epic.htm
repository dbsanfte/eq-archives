kill than most other mobs with 18 people.&nbsp; The spawn time is approximately
1 hour and he has a placeholder.&nbsp; He doesn't always drop the
Manisi Herb, which is what you need from him so you might have to try this more
than once.&nbsp; Return to Ssessthrass and give him the Manisi Herb and the

East of Emkel on a little inlet.&nbsp; You can kill them with two groups of 50+.&nbsp; You will
need a few good clerics and tanks and they shouldn't cause any
trouble.&nbsp;&nbsp;The three mobs are Bone Golem, Failed Apprentice, and
Tormented Spirit.&nbsp; The Bone Golem and the Tormented Spirit were both level
55 and the Failed Apprentice was blue to a 53.&nbsp; The three mobs spawn one

him, Eye of Innoruuk, Blood of Cazic-Thule, and Cloak of Spiroc Feathers.</b></font></p>

<p align="center"><b><font face="Verdana" size="3"><u>Reagents</u></font></b></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>To get the Cloak of Spiroc
Feathers you will need to speak with Jzil Gsix.&nbsp; You asks for you to bring
him a Silver Disc, Spiroc Feathers, and a Black Silk Cape.&nbsp; The Silver Disc
is found off of mobs on the second isle.&nbsp; It is most commonly dropped off
of Azeracks, level 53&nbsp; monsters of the second isle.&nbsp; The Spiroc
Feathers are dropped from the Watchful Guardian on the 3rd Isle.&nbsp; They are
level 53-55.&nbsp; The final item, Black Silk Cape, is dropped by the boss of
the fourth island, Keeper of Souls.&nbsp; He is a level 60 mob that death
touches every 30 seconds.&nbsp; He can quad hit for 400 which is a real
nuisance.&nbsp; Bring along many of your friends to kill him.&nbsp; The cape
drops about 1 every 15 times (Drop rate changed as of 5/8.&nbsp; New drop rate
needed).&nbsp; Finally, take the three items to Jzil and he
will give you the Cloak of Spiroc Feathers.</b></font></p>
<p align="left"><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">The Eye of Innoruuk still drops from Innoruuk in Plane of Hate

that drop this Eye include Maestro of
Rancor, a Ashenbone Drake, Magi P' Tasa (Level 55), Master of Spite, Thought 
Destroyer, and the Corrupter of Life.&nbsp; Maestro of Rancor is a level 53 Follower of Innoruuk, Maestro of
Rancor.&nbsp; He can be found sitting at his piano.&nbsp; Be careful with this

me</font></a>.&nbsp; Ashenbone Drakes aren't too difficult to kill.&nbsp; They
must be meleed to death though because any casters casting on them must be right
next to it and this may cause the drake to attack the caster.&nbsp; They range from
level 51 to 53.</font></b></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>The Blood of Cazic-Thule is
dropped off of Terror, one of the iron guardians guarding Cazic's temple in
Plane of Fear.&nbsp; He is level 60 and said to be the second hardest creature
in Plane of Fear.</b></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Take all three items plus the

<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><b><font face="Verdana" size="3"><u>The End</u></font></b></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Go back to Kazen and give him 
the Prepared Reagents Box for Tome of Instruction.&nbsp; When you give the 
Thunder Spirit Princess 3pp, Gkzzallk spawns on the Gorgalosk Isle, and you are 
given forty minutes to get there before he despawns. The best way to do this is 
to clear isle one, making sure everyone has an item to turn in for their key to 
Azerack Isle, then before killing the princess and spawning Sirran, turn in the 
3pp, thus starting the timer. After killing the princess and turning in the key 
pieces, you merely need to clear Azerack isle and get to Gorgalosk Isle, in 
under 40 minutes. If you are pressed for time, or your group is not large enough 
to kill the entire isle in enough time, merely kill the static spawn Azerack, 
which will trigger Protector of Sky, once he dies and Sirran spawns, you can get 
to Gorgalosk Isle. This is not usually recommended, as Sirran will assist any 
roaming Azerack in attacking you. Gorgalosk Isle does not need to be cleared to 
do the turn in to Gkzzallk, as the isle is non-aggro, so only the Necromancer 
needs to port there. Once he does the turn in, Gkzzallk despawns, he gets the 
item, and everyone can leave.&nbsp; Give the Tome of Instruction to Gkzzallk.&nbsp;
He will give you Gkzzallk in a Bottle.&nbsp; Take the Bottle back to Kazen.&nbsp;
You will finally recieve the Scythe of Shadowed Souls.</b></font></p>
