<p align="center"><b><font face="Verdana" size="3"><u>Jeweled Dragon Head Hilt</u></font></b></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#000000"><b>The quest starts in Lake Rathe where you
must retrieve the Unjeweled Dragon Head Hilt.&nbsp; It spawns underneath the
three aviak spawn tower.&nbsp; If you go straight down underwater and swim to
the bottom, you will find the hilt lying there.&nbsp; You don't need enduring
breath if you know where the hilt is but it might be safer with it.&nbsp; Next you need one diamond, one black sapphire, and
one jacinth.&nbsp; These drop in the planes, high level dungeons such as
Karnor's Castle and Sebilis, and can be bought for high prices in trading zones
such as Greater Faydark.&nbsp; Take the items to Wenden Blackhammer, a level 50
Dwarf in East Freeport.&nbsp; He will give you back the Jeweled Dragon Head
Hilt.&nbsp;</b> </font></p>
<p align="center"><b><font face="Verdana" size="3"><u>Finely Crafted Dragon Head
Hilt</u></font></b></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#000000" face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Next, retrieve the Damaged Dragon
Head Hilt from the Chessboard in Timorous Deep.&nbsp; The location is
-6500, +3000.&nbsp; It spawns at the base of the King Piece.&nbsp; Get a druid
to come with you so that they can cast SoW and Levitate.&nbsp; This way you
won't have to swim the entire way or loose levitate half way there and have to
swim the rest of the way.&nbsp; Evil classes be warned, there is a high elf 
wizard that roams the area.&nbsp; He is kos to evil classes, and will blast you 
apart if you get too near him.&nbsp; </b></font></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#000000" face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Next,&nbsp; get a Giant Sized Monocle from a Mountain Giant
Patriarch in the Dreadlands (rare drop).&nbsp; This is a level 47 mountain giant
that spawns around the giant fortress.&nbsp; One way to get it to spawn is to
kill absolutely everything in the fortress.&nbsp; This can be done easily by a
level 55+ warrior with a 35-60 level druid/cleric for heals and
regeneration.&nbsp; After everything is killed wait for it to spawn again and
then kill them.&nbsp; Continue doing this until the Patriarch spawns. The Patriarch
cannot be soloed.&nbsp; You will need one full group of level 47-52.&nbsp; With
a full group, he is very easy.&nbsp; These Giants has tons of hit points so be careful when
killing them.&nbsp; Take the Monocle to Mentrax Mountainbone in Frontier
Mountains.&nbsp; He is at the giant fortress at the very end of the mine.&nbsp;
You might have to do a little bit of fighting to get there.&nbsp; Mentrax will
give you in return for the Monocle Rejesiam Ore.&nbsp; Next, head to the Plane
of Fear.&nbsp; You must loot the Ball of Everliving Golem from either Fright,
Terror, or Dread.&nbsp; These are all level 50-52 named golems and personal
guards of Cazic-Thule.&nbsp; They spawn at the temple.&nbsp; Take the Hilt, Ore,
and Ball back to Wenden Blackhammer and he will give you the Finely Crafted
Dragon Head Hilt.&nbsp;</b></font></p>

<p align="center"><b><font face="Verdana" size="3"><u>Ancient Sword Blade</u></font></b></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#000000" face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Now, go to The Freeport Authority
and purchase a Keg of Vox Tail Ale.&nbsp; This will cost only 150-200 platinum
depending on your charisma.&nbsp; Now go to Permafrost and kill An Ice
Giant.&nbsp; Note: You must kill the Ice Giants in Permafrost.&nbsp; These are
level 38-42 and put up for a very hard fight.&nbsp; They hit for over 100 damage
rapidly and have tons of hitpoints.&nbsp; A major pain in the butt.&nbsp;
Sometimes they will drop A Block of Permafrost.&nbsp; This is one of the items
you need.&nbsp; While you are in Permafrost waiting for one to spawn, kill some
goblin wizards and loot the heart of frost.&nbsp; You will need it later in the
quest.&nbsp; Now, if you have high tinkering skill, create two Rebreathers.&nbsp;
If you don't have high tinkering skill, then you can purchase these from players
in Greater Faydark.&nbsp; They go for around 2-3k a piece.&nbsp; Turn in the
items to Denken Strongpick.&nbsp; He can be found on the aviak island in Ocean
of Tears.&nbsp; He will give you the Ancient Sword Blade.</b></font></p>
<p align="center"><b><font face="Verdana" size="3"><u>Ancient Blade</u></font></b></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#000000" face="Verdana" size="2"><b>The Ancient Blade is dropped by
the Queen of Chardok, Queen Velazul.&nbsp; She takes an Uber Guild to kill 
because she is level 62.&nbsp; She has many followers around her including 
sorcerers and healers.&nbsp; She is a shaman so she has been AE spells such as 
high damage spells and poison AE's.</b></font></p>
<p align="center"><b><font face="Verdana" size="3"><u>The Red
Scabbard</u></font></b></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#000000" face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Go to East
Freeport and find Kargek Redblade.&nbsp; Hail him and say I will do you a
favor.&nbsp; He gives you a wax sealed note.&nbsp; Take this note to Oknoggin
Stonesmasher, a named ogre in Feerrott.&nbsp; He can be found standing next to
the stone bridge.&nbsp; He will give you a Tiny Lute in return for the
note.&nbsp; Take the Lute back to Kargek in exchange for a Book.&nbsp; Take the
book to Tenal Redblade in East Karanas.&nbsp; He is at the very end of the
canyon next to the ramp to Highpass.&nbsp; This is a very long canyon and you
will past many NPCs here.&nbsp; Tenal is the very last one.&nbsp; Tenal will give you a Frozen War
Totem.&nbsp; Give him the Frozen War Totem and the Heart of Frost (That you
looted while hunting Ice Giants).&nbsp; He will give you the Totem of Fiery
War.&nbsp; Now you need a Red Scale.&nbsp; This is most commonly dropped by Lord
Nagafen, a level 55 dragon in Nagafen's Lair but can also be found off of Zordakilicus
Ragefire in Solusek,
or Talendor in Skyfire.&nbsp;Now find the Green Scale from Severilous, a level
60 sarnak dragon in Emerald Jungle.&nbsp; This mean dragon slashes for 500 and
has a wolf pet to help him.&nbsp; You need many many groups to kill this
monster.&nbsp;There is also a mob in The Hole named Nortlav the Scalekeeper.&nbsp;
He is a level 51-55 Erudite that drops the Red Dragon Scale and for the Warrior Epic.&nbsp; He hits for about 190 on average.&nbsp; He has
a nasty harmtouch that does around 1500 damage.&nbsp; He also uses harmtouch,
and has a high magic resist.&nbsp; Wizard spells Ice Comet and the Lure Line
will stick.&nbsp; Necromancer DoTs will also work.&nbsp; In the patch 06.27.01,
a new source for the Green Dragon Scale was added.&nbsp; This source has
recently been discovered!&nbsp; It drops from Hoshkar in Veeshan's Peak.&nbsp;
This dragon is level 65 dragon that can only be killed by very uber
guilds.&nbsp; Take the red scale, the green scale, and the Totem of Fiery War and
give them to Tenal.&nbsp; Tenal will give you the Mark of the Sword.&nbsp; Now
go to The Plane of Hate and kill the level 53 Follower of Innoruuk, Maestro of
Rancor.&nbsp; He can be found sitting at his piano.&nbsp; Be careful with this
guy because he has a 200 hp AOE lifetap spell.&nbsp; Once he has been killed, a
small hand which looks like a frightfinger, will spawn at Maestro's Piano.&nbsp;
When killing it, you will need to keep it rooted because it runs very fast when
low of health.&nbsp; After you kill this hand, another hand will spawn which is
called Hand of the Maestro.&nbsp; This hits hard and has a ton of hp so be
prepared for a fairly hard fight. Loot the Hand of Maestro
from him which drops every time.&nbsp; This is a rare drop so it might take a few kills to get
it.&nbsp; Turn in the Hand and the Mark of the Sword to Tenal for a message to
Kargek.&nbsp; Now go to The Plane of Air and kill The Spiroc Lord.&nbsp; This is
one of the hardest creatures in Plane of Air.&nbsp; It is level 63 and looks
like a rainbow aviak.&nbsp; Take the note and the Spiroc Wingblade looted from
the Spiroc Lord to Kargek.&nbsp; He will reward you will the Red Scabbard.&nbsp;</b></font></p>
<p align="center"><b><font face="Verdana" size="3"><u>The End</u></font></b></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#000000" face="Verdana" size="2"><b>You then take the
Blades and the Hilts and you combine them in The Red Scabbard.&nbsp; You then
will come out with two 1 handed weapons.&nbsp; You can use these weapons if you
are specialized in 1 hand or you can combine those two 1 hand weapons in the
scabbard again and get one two handed weapon.&nbsp; Notice:&nbsp; All effects on
weapons are proced, therefor they will work only while in combat.</b></font></p>
