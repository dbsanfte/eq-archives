want to miss the boat or else you will be waiting the awhile unless you can port
yourself out.&nbsp; Get off the boat at Butcherblock and go to South Kaladim.&nbsp;

behind a bar.&nbsp; Give him one kiola nut and one regular water flask (not
foraged or summoned) for your Tumpy Tonic.&nbsp; Give him another kiola nut and
