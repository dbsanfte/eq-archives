<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">You say: What boots?</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">Sirtha Scarscale says 'Cactus quills
can be very lethal. I seek to work them into my new boots. Find me these quills,
a pair of skeletal feet, an emerald of fire, and some banded boots so that I may

'Cactus quills can be very lethal. I seek to work them into my new boots. Find
me these quills, a pair of skeletal feet, an emerald of fire, and some banded
boots so that I may start working on them. Why are you still here?! Begone!</p>
<p>For the Boots you will need, Cactus Quills, a Skeletal Feet, a Fire Emerald,
and Banded Boots. Cactus Quills drop off of Thorny Succulants within Overthere.
They drop pretty commonly. If you are in a group at the ledge or somewhere close
you shouldn’t have trouble getting them. If you plan on soloing here, the
Succulants are level 30-33 and hit for around 40-60 points of damage. The
Skeletal feet drop from a Thick Boned Skeleton within Kurn’s Tower. The Thick
Boned Skeleton spawn in the basement as the placeholder for the Fingered
Skeleton, the Jester, and the Cook. He is only level 14-20 and drops the Feet
uncommonly. About once every 4 times. The Fire Emerald can be bought off of
jewelers for around 80-100 platinum depending on your charisma.&nbsp; The Banded
Boots can either be made with the blacksmithing skill or bought off of players
for around 10 platinum.</p>

<p>You say, 'What bracer?'<br>
Sarth Scarscale says 'Have you ever seen Bloodgills? I hear they will devour a
broodling in seconds and that their scales are tough as iron. Bring me some of
these scales, a banded bracer, and a sapphire as blue as the sky. Only then will
I give the bracer to you, broodling.</p>
<p>For the Bracers you will need Bloodgill Scale, a Banded Bracer, and a
Sapphire. The Bloodgill Scales drop from Bloodgills within Lake of Ill Omen. The
Bloodgills are level 35-40 so you will either have to be in a group killing them
or you can ask the group to loot them since the Scales aren’t used for
anything else. The Banded Bracer can either be made with the blacksmithing skill
or bought off of players for around 5 platinum. The sapphires can be bought at
any jewelry shop for approximately 105 platinum depending on your charisma.</p>

<p align="center"><b><u><font face="Verdana" size="3">The Breastplate</font></u></b></p>
<font FACE="Verdana" SIZE="2">
<p>You say, 'What breastplate?'<br>
Sarth Scarscale says 'Ahhhh....a breastplate you want, is it? Well, they are not
easy to come by. Fetch me a scorpion chitin. Intact, mind you! They are
extremely fragile and must be treated before they can protect your carcass.
Also, fetch me a war braid from a sarnak to connect the pieces. I also require a
ruby and your banded tunic. Do this and I shall make it for you, hatchling. Now,
go!</p>
<p>For the Breastplate you will need a scorpion chitin, a sarnak war braid, a
ruby, and a banded tunic. The scorpion chitin drops off of Large Heartsting
Scorpions within the Field of Bone. They spawn out behind Kurn’s Tower and
also in the Pit. They are level 15-17 but can be taken by a full group of 8s and
9s as long as there is at least one healer. The chitin is a rare drop. The
Sarnak War Braids are dropped commonly off of Sarnak Berserker’s in Lake of
Ill Omen which are level 30-33 and spawn most commonly around the Ledge. The
Ruby can be bought at an jewelry store for around 110-150 platinum depending on
your charisma. The Banded Mail can either be made with the blacksmithing skill
or bought off of players for around 15 platinum.</p>

<p align="center"><b><u><font face="Verdana" size="3">The Gauntlets</font></u></b></p>
<font FACE="Verdana" SIZE="2">
<p>You say, 'What gauntlets?'<br>
Sirtha Scarscale says 'I currently have need<br>
of a complete skeletal hand, for the research I am conducting. I wish to study
its properties and form so that I can make gauntlets befitting our station. I
also require two rubies that holds stars within and some banded gauntlets to
complete my ritual. Do that and the gauntlets are yours to keep.</p>
<p>For the Gauntlets, you will need a Skeletal Hand, two star rubies, and banded
gauntlets. The Skeletal Hand drops most commonly off of charbone skeletons
within Lake of Ill Omen. They are around level 23-27 and spawn most commonly
around the skeleton house. Be careful not to confuse the Skeletal Hand with a
Skeletal Fist or a Skeletal Wrist. These are not part of the quest. The two Star
Rubies can be bought at an jewelry store for around 80 platinum each depending
on your charisma. The Banded Bracer can either be made with the blacksmithing
skill or bought off of players for around 10 platinum.</p>

<p align="center"><b><u><font face="Verdana" size="3">The Greaves</font></u></b></p>
<font FACE="Verdana" SIZE="2">
<p>You say, 'What greaves?'<br>
Sarth Scarscale says 'Do you know the beasts that call themselves sarnaks? One
such beast who calls itself Zorash attacked an envoy of merchants who were to
deliver a pair of special boots to me. It taunts us by wearing them as a trophy.
Bring them back and the skull of Grachnist, his goblin ally. Return them to me
along with a star ruby and your banded greaves, and I shall craft you an
excellent pair of greaves.</p>
<p>For the Greaves you will need the boots dropped by Zorash, the skull of
Grachnist, one star ruby, and banded greaves. Zorash is a rare spawn and drops
the boots rarely. Rare drop from a rare spawn means you better clear off your
schedule for many days. He spawns in the ruins in Overthere. He is level 32 once
you pull him and not very hard to kill. The problem is just getting him to
spawn. Grachnist the Destroyer is a named Goblin is found in the goblin fort in
Warsliks woods and also in at least two of the goblin-infested ruins in the same
zone. The most common spawn point for this was the tent area with the rotating
spit and the right in front of the fort over the bridge. Just have two people
wait in these areas and kill every goblin that spawns. This way you get
Grachnist to spawn very often very quickly. The skull drops about one in every
five times.</font><b><font FACE="Verdana" SIZE="1"> </font></b><font FACE="Verdana" SIZE="2">The
Star Ruby can be bought at an jewelry store for around 80 platinum depending on
your charisma. The Banded Greaves can either be made with the blacksmithing
skill or bought off of players for around 12 platinum.</font></p>

<p align="center"><b><u><font face="Verdana" size="3">The Helm</font></u></b></p>
<font FACE="Verdana" SIZE="2">
<p>You say, 'What helm?'<br>
Sirtha Scarscale says 'The sarnak are a mockery of the Iksar. They are nothing
more than beasts fit only to do our bidding! I require you to bring me the sword
of one of their Order of Knights and the head of a sarnak berserker. These
beasts have been attacking our patrols of late. I also require a stone called a
ruby and a banded helm. Do this and I shall make a helm for you.</p>
<p>For the Helm you will need, A Sarnak Berserker Head, a Sarnak Knight Sword, a
Ruby, and a Banded Helm. The Sarnak Berserker Head drops from Sarnak Berserker’s
within Lake of Ill Omen. This is a uncommon drop off of the berserker’s, which
are most commonly camped at the Ledge or at Frontier Mountains zone. They are
around level 30-33 and don’t have too many hit points. The Sarnak Knight Sword
drops rarely from Sarnak Knights. These are around 33-37 and spawn in Burning
Woods at the Chardok Zone. You can also tell if they have one because they will
be holding it in their hands. The rubies can be bought at any jewelry shop for
the price of 105-150 platinum depending on your charisma. The Banded Helm can
either be made with the blacksmithing skill or bought off of players for around
10 platinum.</p>

<p>You say, 'What mask?'<br>
Sarth Scarscale says 'Have you ever encountered a drixie before? I crush every
one I see. They are an annoyance beyond mere words! Kill the Queen and bring me
her wings as a trophy along with an emerald of fire and a banded mask.</p>
<p>For the Mask you will need, The Wings of the Drixie Queen who is known Lady
Chromoire, a Fire Emerald, and a Banded Mask. She spawns to the right of the
bridge to the city and heads then starts to head north. She continues on that
way until she gets to –200, 200 and then she stops. You will want to catch her
as soon as she spawns so that she is not attacked by any drolvargs or spiders
which do attack her and kill her if you don’t do so first. Lady Chromoire is
blue to a level 26. Fire Emerald can be bought off of jewelers for around 80-100
platinum depending on your charisma. The Banded Helm can either be made with the
blacksmithing skill or bought off of players for around 5 platinum.</p>

<p align="center"><b><u><font face="Verdana" size="3">The Vambraces</font></u></b></p>
<font FACE="Verdana" SIZE="2">
<p>You say, 'What Vambraces?'<br>
Sirtha Scarscale says 'The hideous Golra are hardy creatures. The tales indicate
their ferocity almost matches our own. I wish to gain a trophy of one of these
beasts. Bring me the skin of one, two blue sapphires, and banded sleeves. Then I
shall give you these fine vambraces.</p>
<p>For the Vambraces, you will need a Golra Skin, two Blue Sapphires, and Banded
Sleeves. The Golra Skins drop from Hulking Golra’s within Timorous Deep on a
glacier at location -9000, -5000. The best way is to jump off the raft from
Oasis once you get into Timorous Deep, bring someone to cast levitate (or
already have it on), and run to the location. The Golra’s are level 33-35 and
hit very hard for their level. Be careful if you see the named Golra, Halara.
She is around 40, but shouldn’t attempted to be kill unless you are 45+. Blue
Sapphires can be bought off of jewelers for around 120-140 platinum depending on
your charisma.&nbsp; The Banded Vambraces can either be made with the
blacksmithing skill or bought off of players for around 10 platinum.</p>
