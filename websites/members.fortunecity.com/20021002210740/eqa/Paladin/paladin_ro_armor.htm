<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">For each of these quests you will
need a certain faction at amiably to do the Mold part of the quest. If that
faction is not at amiably, you will have to raise it. To turn in the items for
the <a href="ronium_quest.htm"><font color="#000000">Bars of Ronium</font></a>, your faction with the Temple of Solusek Ro must be at
amiably. This can be raised by killing shadowmen most commonly in either West
Commons or South Karanas. Also, for each quest, if it is not given outright by
the person offering the quest, then you must go to a specified person at the
Faction Area and ask if you can do the quest. For example, for The Gauntlets,
you would have to ask Gygus Remnara in the Temple of Marr in Freeport, &quot;Am
I an honored member.&quot; If Gygus would say yes, then you could do the quest.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">For the boots you will need Kilij
Plans and a Bar of Ronium. The Kilij Plans drop off of Sandgiant Husam. The
Sandgiant Husam spawns in South Ro. He is the basically an exact replica of a
normal sand giant: many hit points for level, hits hard, magic restist very low.
It is level 27-29. The placeholders for him are regular Sand Giants. Kill sand
giants and eventually he should spawn. Also, if you are trying to do the
Journeyman boots quest and trying to get the Ancient Cyclops to spawn then this
Sandgiant will probably spawn too. Bring back the Kilij Plans to Nicolas in
Rathe Mountains at (2963,-824) and you will be rewarded with the mold for the
boots. Combine the Bar of Ronium with the mold for the boot in a forge and you
will get your Boots of Ro. The smithing skill is not required in this step</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">For the bracers you will need two
Goblin Nets and a Bar of Ronium. The two Goblin Nets drop from Goblin Net
Masters. These are level 31 creatures found in the waters of Lake Rathe. To find
this guy, head to the stone tower island at approximately 2712,-375. Then, head
to the docks where there is a boat on this island (in the corner). Get into the
water but don’t actually go under. Make it so your eyes are right on the water
so that you can see as well below as you can above. The net master spawns
exactly every 2 hours. If he is already up, then it will only take you 2 hours
to get the two nets. When waiting in this position he should pass by. You can
also head over to the docks at the island with the two Aviak Guards at
approximately 800, 740, or just follow the right wall if you are coming from the
South Karana zone. Once you find the goblin, you must go about the task of
killing him. The goblin is a shadowknight and casts Fear, Harmtouch, and 
Engulfing Darkness. He also hits for 70 damage. Take the two goblin nets to David in Rathe Mountains (loc needed) for the mold of the Bracers. Then, combine the mold
with the Bar of Ronium in a forge for the Bracer of Ro. You do not need the
smithing skill for this step.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">For the Breastplate you will need 2
Dark Cauldrons, and a Bar of Ronium. The 2 dark cauldrons drop off of Ancille
Cooks within Mistmoore. These are level 33 Shadowknights. The best way to get
the Dark Cauldrons is to camp them in the Kitchen. Two of them spawn here but be
very careful because they both harmtouch for 400 damage. To get around this
without having your tank being destroyed in the first few seconds of battle, you
need to have either another tank or an enchanter. The two tanks would attack
both of the cooks and each would take 400 damage. The cleric would then heal
them both. If the cleric is not high enough and doesn’t have enough mana, you
will need another cleric to help get the job done. An enchanter would work
because she/he can mez one of the cooks. You must keep the cook mesmerized or
else the enchanter will get harm touched and that would not be good at all. Once
you have the two Dark Cauldrons, return them to Abigail in Rathe Mountains (loc
needed) for the mold of the Breastplate. Combine the mold with the Bar of Ronium
and you will get your Breastplate of Ro. The smithing skill is not required for
this step.</p>

Locket and a Bar of Ronium. The Locket drops off of Sentry Alechin within South
Karanas. This is an common spawn that spawns around the aviak village and then
wanders the whole zone. He is a paladin and using LOH when he is low on mana. He
also heals after he gets down below half health. At nights he turns into and
undead werewolf. Alechin is level 31-35. Turn in the locket to Joanna within
Rathe Mountains at (2971,-761) for the mold for the gauntlets. Then combine the
mold and the Bar of Ronium in a forge for the Gauntlets of Ro. This last step

Nightfall Giant Head and a Bar of Ronium. The Nightfall Giant Head drops off of
a Nightfall Giant in West Commons. He spawns only at dusk and wanders near the
Druid Ring. The Head weighs 20 pounds and can only be carried in a main
inventory slot or in a Large Sewing Kit. Once you find the Nightfall Giant, he
is around level 35 and hits quite hard for his level. You will either have to
kite him, and you will need a lot of mana to do this, or you can get a cleric to
come along and heal you while you melee him. Take the Head to Elizabeth in Rathe
Mountains (loc needed) for the mold for the Greaves. Combine the mold and the
Bar of Ronium for the Greaves of Ro. This last step does not take any smithing

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">For the Vambraces you will need two
Rotten Shark Meats and a Bar of Ronium. The Rotten Shark Meat drops from Plagued
Sharks in Erud’s Crossing. The best way to find them is to get a tracker but
if you don’t have one accessible then there is another little trick. Get on
the boat in Qeynos and then when you zone into Erud’s Crossing, get off the
boat at the first stop. Get right up to the water line and go into crouch mode.
Then slowly wade into the water until your eyes are just even with the water
line. I don't know why but crouching makes it easier. While you're facing the
water the dock should be on your left and you will be at the end of the little
peninsula. When you get to the point where your eyes are even with the waterline
you will be able to see under the water like it was daylight. At that point you
should see a few sharks swimming ahead. If no one else is camping the shark, it
should probably be up, and one of the few sharks swimming ahead should be the
plague shark. He is level 35-38 and hits in the 70s. He also has a direct damage
spell that does 180 damage as well as a dispel. The plague shark spawns every
two hours. Once you have the two rotten shark meats, take them to Marianna in
Rathe Mountains at (2890,-839) for the mold for the Vambraces. Combine the mold
with the Bar of Ronium and you will get the Vambraces of Ro. This last step
doesn’t take any smithing skill.</p>
