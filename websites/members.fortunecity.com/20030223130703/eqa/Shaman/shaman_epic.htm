<p><font face="Verdana,Arial" size="2">Go to the Gornit Island in Ocean of
Tears.&nbsp; The location is about 800, -5400.&nbsp; There you may find Capt
Surestout.&nbsp; If he is there, kill him.&nbsp; He is very easy being only
level 20 halfling.&nbsp; When he is dead, a lesser spirit will spawn on his
corpse.&nbsp; Hail it.<br>
<br>
You say, 'hail a lesser spirit'<br>
<br>
a lesser spirit says 'Did you take this person's life, shaman?<br>
<br>
You say, 'yes'<br>
<br>
a lesser spirit says 'Why have you taken this person's life, (your name) ? Did he
threaten your life? Did you dislike him? Or was his death a profit to you in
some way?<br>
<br>
You say, 'he threatened my life'<br>
<br>
a lesser spirit says 'I see. It brings me sadness to see another die, but his
heart was black and a great nothingness. His body will become the grass now.
Thank you for what you have done, shaman.<br>
<br>
You say, 'who are you?'<br>
<br>
a lesser spirit says 'What, or who, I am isn't as important as what, or who, WE
are. Do you wish to know more, shaman?<br>
<br>
You say, 'i wish to know more'<br>
<br>
a lesser spirit says 'That is good, (your name) . Take this gem. It is a part of us
like the clouds to the sky and is a wonderful gift from the grandfather. Take
this gem to where the humans gather to spoil the land and water. Some call it a
port. There you will find one of us, a shaman like yourself. Give him the gem
and perhaps he will tell you more of the spirits.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana,Arial" size="2">The port he speaks of is of course
Freeport.&nbsp; North Freeport to be exact.&nbsp; And the shaman is Bondl
Felligan.&nbsp; You can find him in the sewers in the northwest part of
town.&nbsp; He is inside the collapsed wall.&nbsp; Hand the gem over to him.<br>
<br>
You say, 'hail Bondl Felligan'<br>
<br>
Bondl Felligan burps loudly in your face and says, 'Bah! Leave me be, fool! You
have nothin' I want and I certainly have nothin' you want.'<br>
<br>
Now give the gem to him.<br>
<br>
Bondl Felligan says 'WOW, thanks! This must be worth a fortune! I could drink
for a month after sellin' this to one of them fool merchants. I'm going to see
how much I can get for it right now!<br>
<br>
Now wait for him to move out of the sewers and into the city.&nbsp; He will stop
and talk.<br>
<br>
Bondl Felligan says 'What!? You don't approve of me buyin' some drinks with this
gem? Who the heck are you to offer me a gift and order me what to do with it? Is
this some kinda conditional kindness? Well? Are you gonna let me buy some booze
with this or not?<br>
<br>
You say, 'you can buy booze'<br>
<br>
Bondl Felligan suddenly becomes completely sober and says, 'Very well, shaman,
please come with me.'<br>
<br>
Now, wait for him to go to the Jade Uncerground Inn.&nbsp; Go up to the third
floor and walk into the middle room.&nbsp; Inside will be a greater spirit.<br>
<br>
You say, 'hail a greater spirit'<br>
<br>
a greater spirit says 'Greetings, shaman. Tell me, do you follow [Justice],
[War], [Fear], or [Hate]?<br>
<br>
You say, 'i follow justice'<br>
<br>
a greater spirit says 'Ah, a follower of the Tribunal from the North you are,
then. You would be best served by speaking to my brother in the next room.
Farewell, (your name) .<br>
<br>
Go to the next room at the end of the hallway.&nbsp; You will find another
greater spirit.<br>
<br>
You say, 'hail a greater spirit'<br>
<br>
a greater spirit says 'It is good to see you, (your name) . We're glad you trusted in
our brother and did what was asked regardless of Bondl's intentions. This fills
us with joy, as the [true spirits] work in ways most people would not understand
and [trust] is the first lesson of the [Heyokah].<br>
<br>
You say, 'what true spirits?'<br>
<br>
a greater spirit says 'As a shaman, spirits are known to you. They aid you if
you pay them homage and respect the world around you. They also will bend to
your will if you are powerful enough. We are a part of the entire universe and
we exist because people believe and feel us. However [very few] know us in this
form. To mortals we are but ideas, [wisps of consciousness] in an expanse of
emptiness and as difficult to grasp as breath in Everfrost.<br>
<br>
You say, 'what very few?'<br>
<br>
a greater spirit says 'There are only a handful of mortals we've judged worthy
to be friends and, reluctantly, masters. We call them the [Heyokah]. Bondl is
one of them and he helps to test those we believe might be able to grasp our
existence. There are many troubles that threaten us and our home. We seek those
with the wisdom, patience, and might to help us ensure the health of the cosmos.
Whether you seek balance or personal power, this is important to you.<br>
<br>
You say, 'what wisps of consciousness?'<br>
<br>
a greater spirit says 'It is difficult for mortals to grasp what we are for we
are not material that can be held or consumed. We are the spirit that drives
beings to do what beings do. The wolf lives to run and hunt. When you ask for
his aid, his spirit enters your body and you 'become' wolf. The ox is the
personification of endurance and when he enters your body, you do not become an
ox, you become all that is ox. I myself am the spirit of understanding.<br>
<br>
You say, 'what trust do you speak of?'<br>
<br>
a greater spirit says 'Trust is the glue of the universe. When one trusts others
to do their part, it allows them to focus on what they must do themselves. The
trust that others have in us also gives us the confidence to do our parts
effectively, thus maintaining harmony. When one becomes dissatisfied with his
part and pursues his own desires, this is called greed. And greed destroys the
glue of the universe. This is why we wished the bandits under the grass.<br>
<br>
You say, 'what heyokah?'<br>
<br>
a greater spirit says 'The Heyokah are our mortal counterparts. Some are our friends who seek to help us in whatever goals we deem important. Some seek
nothing more than to enslave and command us to do their bidding. We accept this
and often make deals with those we realize are powerful enough to accomplish
what needs to be done. To judge such individuals, we have prepared a test. We
ask that before we enter into these contracts, the shaman walk the [path of the
Heyokah]. We see you may be worthy. Will you walk the path? You will be rewarded
for your efforts, albeit grudgingly.<br>
<br>
The greater spirit, after explaining all this will give you the opaque gem.<br>
<br>
After receiving the gem, you will need to say this.<br>
<br>
You say, 'i will walk the path of the Heyokah'<br>
<br>
a greater spirit says 'That is good, (your name) . You will need to walk three paths
before you can reach that of the Heyokah. The paths of patience, wisdom, and
might. First, you must learn patience. Take this gem and go on a pilgrimage to
an island in the great water the wasichu call Erud's Crossing. The Kerrans there
are our allies and can show you to our next contact, Ooglyn. Give Ooglyn the gem
and do what she asks. As you walk the path, remember what you've learned about
trust.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana,Arial" size="2">The greater spirit despawns immediately.<br>
<br>
<br>
Travel to Erud's Crossing.&nbsp; Locate Ooglyn.&nbsp; She is an ogre shaman on
the island that the boat stops at at -900, 1600.&nbsp; He spawn time is 2
hours.&nbsp; Give her the gem as the greater spirit asked.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana,Arial" size="2">Head to Erud's Crossing. Find Ooglyn, a female ogre shaman, on the island.
Approx. loc -900, 1600. She should be up, if not her spawn time is 2 hours.<br>
<br>
This was found on Allakhazam's: As of now this quest is bugged. Before handing in the gem go to loc 0,0 in
Erud's Crossing, if you see a naked human female floating above the water with
no name then you NEED a gm to come and despawn her. Otherwise the quest npcs
will not spawn and you'll have wasted that effort.<br>
<br>
You say, 'hail Ooglyn'<br>
<br>
Ooglyn says 'Ooooh, it you, (your name) . Me's been waitin for you cuz our frenz say
you comin an need da test. So's I gib you da test. Hmm, now where me put it?
Ooglyn been waiting for sign for so long dat me forget where me put test. Keep
your eyes out for sign while me look for test. Oh, hey, (your name) , they gib you
gem? I need dat gem, please, heheh.<br>
<br>
Hand the opaque gem to Ooglyn<br>
<br>
Ooglyn says 'Ahhh, tank you, now me can...OH LOOK!! DA SIGN!!!! Oh, sorry you
missed it. The sign show you where to wait for da test. Follow me...I like you
so I take you there. We goin for a swim, (your name) !<br>
<br>
Ooglyn will start running away.&nbsp; Follow her until she goes into the
water.&nbsp; Then (you will need anedure breath, fishbone earring, etc. for
this) go to -1600, 4200.&nbsp; Ooglyn will be there waiting for you.<br>
<br>
Ooglyn says 'Ok shaman, let us be off.<br>
<br>
Ooglyn says 'Ok, here Is place for you to for waiting. Hab fun shaman!<br>
<br>
She wanders off in some direction.&nbsp; Do not follow her.&nbsp; NPCs will
suddenly start spawning around you one by one.&nbsp; The first one to spawn is
Srafen the Soaked.
<br>
<br>
You say, 'hail Srafen the Soaked'<br>
<br>
Srafen the Soaked says 'Why hello there! Ahh, it's good to see a new face down
[here]. So you've come to [wait] with [us] eh? That is splendid! It's been
getting very boring lately.<br>
<br>
You say, 'Where is here?'<br>
<br>
Srafen the Soaked says 'Oh! Well this is where [we wait]. It's not much for
looks but if you're lucky, a pretty fish will swim by. Oh, and once Dillon said
he saw one of those fish women, a mermaid, he called it! Although, I'm not so
sure of his state of mind, hehehe. He's been waiting here much longer than I.<br>
<br>
You say, 'Who is us?'<br>
<br>
Srafen the Soaked says 'Well, there's me, Srafen. I've been down here for, can't
quite remember, a number of years, I guess. If my wife saw the condition my
clothes are in, she'd whack me, I'm sure, heheh. Although I'd bet she's long
since dead, probably. Then there's Dillon. He says he's been here since those
people up top in Erud blew that big hole in the ground. Not sure what happened
but I guess it was a long time ago. Hmmmm, who [else]?<br>
<br>
You say, 'What do you wait for?'<br>
<br>
Srafen the Soaked says 'We've been waiting quite some time, really. I have been
here the least amount of time, but that doesn't help keep the boredom away,
heheh. What are we waiting for, you ask? HehehHAahahah! What are we waiting
for?? Heheheh, what a silly question! It's quite obvious if you take the time to
think about it. Heh. Ummm.. I'm really not sure.<br>
<br>
You say, 'Who else?'<br>
<br>
Srafen the Soaked says 'Ahh, yes, there's also a really old guy I've only seen a
couple times, name's Froham. Whew, he is really old, and not much of a talker.
Mostly mumbles from time to time. Dillon says he's been here since Erud first
took his people across the sea. Not sure who this Erud feller is but Froham
isn't in the best of shape, so it must have been a LONG time ago. Froham did
mention there's one other guy but we've never seen him. He apparently had
something to do with the Combine Empire, no idea what that is though.<br>
<br>
Dillon the Drowned then spawns.&nbsp; Apparently at around this point, killer 
sharks will begin to spawn.&nbsp; They are light blue to level 49, but you can 
get numerous sharks at the same time.&nbsp; Keep a pet up.&nbsp; Invis vs 
animals should work against them.&nbsp; They do dispell, so don't have EB as 
your first buff.&nbsp; (More info on this would be appreciated.)<br>
<br>
Dillon the Drowned says 'Well met again, Srafen. How goes it?<br>
<br>
You say, 'hail Dillon the Drowned'<br>
<br>
Dillon the Drowned says 'Hey Srafen, who is this weirdo talking to me? Or is it
another one of those funny illusions Froham keeps talking about?<br>
<br>
Srafen the Soaked looks around frantically a moment then laughs and says, 'Ohhh,
them! Hehehe! This is a friend of mine come to wait with us. Isn't that
exciting, Dillon? And it's not just an illusion, I don't think! Say, are you [an
illusion], shaman?<br>
<br>
You say, 'I am not an illusion.'<br>
<br>
Srafen the Soaked says 'Awww, well that's too bad. Although illusions and real
people don't seem to be much different at times, so, please stay and keep Dillon
and me company. We could use it, right Dillon?<br>
<br>
Srafen the Soaked says 'Hey Dillon, why don't you tell us again about what
happened up top? You know, where they blew that big hole into the ground.<br>
<br>
Dillon the Drowned says 'Again? Oh I don't know Srafen, I don't want to [bore]
our company, even if it is an illusion.<br>
<br>
You say, 'You won't bore me'<br>
<br>
Dillon the Drowned says 'Well ok, I was sent here a long time ago to wait. When
I got here, I couldn't believe all the violence going on. Why would the spirits
send me here to wait when all this fighting and commotion was going on, I
wondered. There were great battles on the ocean in splendid ships made of pine
and shining with [magical enhancements]. While I was waiting below, blasted,
bloody body parts were floating down to the bottom of the ocean all around me.<br>
<br>
You say, 'What magical enhancements?'<br>
<br>
Dillon the Drowned says 'Yes, their ships were very strange, constructed in very
unusual designs and all seemed to shine with a multicolored glow. I heard there
was even a ship that could stay completely underwater for long periods of time.
It had huge steel spikes protruding from the top of its hull used to 'swim'
under enemy ships and puncture their hulls. I always thought that someday all
this magic would cause something [disastrous] and eventually, it did.<br>
<br>
You say, 'What was disastrous?'<br>
<br>
Dillon the Drowned says 'Well, one time, I was here waiting as usual. The
fighting was particularly heavy up top, lots of banging and rumbling around. And
suddenly there was a tremendous screech! I had to cover my ears, it was so loud,
even down here. It felt like the water itself was being torn asunder; I could
imagine what was happening above. After a few seconds of the screeching came a
terrible tremor and rumbling. Great cracks opened up around me and water rushed
to fill them, almost dragging me down into the gods know what. It calmed down a
little while after that and there hasn't been any real fighting ever since. I
suspect they're all dead now. For weeks afterwards, the water had a kind of dead
taste to it. I became ill during that time.<br>
<br>
After Dillon says this, he and Safren will swim away.&nbsp; Do not follow them.&nbsp; 
After a little while, Froham the Forgotten chimes in.&nbsp; Hail him and
continue saying the keyword until we get the logs.<br>
<br>
You say, 'who is abe'<br>
<br>
Froham the Forgotten says 'Yeah, Abe's an old guy. Well, he's kinda beyond bein'
old if ye know what I mean. Not all together either. His mind floats all over
like the sea around us. But he's got enough sense to wait here like he's done
fer, well, fer dang near ever. If ye see him, and he ain't much fer talkin
straight, ask him about [a broken arrow]. Not sure what it means to him but it
seems to bring him around.<br>
<br>
Froham will wander off in a direction.&nbsp; Do not follow him.&nbsp; Wait for a
few minutes and yet another NPC will spawn eventually.<br>
<br>
You say, 'hail Abe the Abandoned'<br>
<br>
Abe the Abandoned turns his head slowly toward you but his eyes never come into
focus. You can't tell if he's looking at you, behind you, or right in front of
his own face. Then, suddenly, he shouts at the top of his lungs, 'HOOOOKAAAHEEEEYYYY!
I AM [ABE]!'<br>
<br>
You say, 'who are you abe?'<br>
<br>
Abe the Abandoned says 'Nothing is hidden. All is discernible if you only know
where to look and you have the right [eyes]. Don't be angry with me if you can't
get your eyes right to see what you're looking for. I'd lend you mine but I
don't wear the same size.<br>
<br>
You say, 'what eyes?'<br>
<br>
Abe the Abandoned begins to draw a picture in the mud with his finger although
it doesn't seem to make any sense at all. He points to his picture and nods
approvingly at you, saying, 'You see? The curtains fell and it was naught but a
dream upon a landscape that we thought we knew. The dream of the [Combine]
fulfilled when we finally trimmed our fingernails and looked into the mud. And
now we are abandoned, in a world that none can see, no one has the eyes.'<br>
<br>
You say, 'what is the combine?'<br>
<br>
Abe the Abandoned shakes his head in amusement and says, 'Heheheh, yeah, you'd think so, wouldn't you? But I guess not'<br>
<br>
You say, 'what broken arrow'<br>
<br>
Abe the Abandoned 's eyes suddenly come into focus, looking deep into your own
and says, 'There was a time when we cared for the world and trod with the
spirits along the paths of the cosmos. We built many great things and worked to
preserve what was. I came here to wait for an answer when we began to die off. We could not figure why this was and I was chosen to come here and
commune with our friends. We carved an arrow, and everyone who was left shaved a
sliver of wood from it. We let it drop to hallowed ground and our highest shaman
stepped on it, breaking it. I've been waiting here for so long. So, so long, to
give it to the spirits, and thank them.'<br>
<br>
Sit down again and wait until Abe talks again.<br>
<br>
Abe the Abandoned says 'Shaman? My time will soon be at hand and I fear I will
never see our friends again. But the arrow must be given, our holy broken arrow.
Shaman, will you bear our obligation and [give them the arrow]? You will know
who to give it to when it is time.<br>
<br>
You say, 'i will give them the arrow'<br>
<br>
Abe the Abandoned removes a quiver slung across his shoulder and solemnly hands it to you without a word.<br>
<br>
You will receive a broken arrow from Abe.<br>
<br>
Sit down again and wait until Abe talks again.<br>
<br>
Abe the Abandoned suddenly gasps and says, 'I have found it! I know the answer!
Come with me and I will tell you. Eyes are everywhere and this knowledge is not
for everyone. Finally my centuries of waiting are over hahahaha! Follow me
Shaman!<br>
<br>
Do not move.&nbsp; This is a test and you have to be patient.&nbsp; Do not
follow Abe.&nbsp; Soon, a greater spirit will spawn.<br>
<br>
You say, 'hail a greater spirit'<br>
<br>
a greater spirit says 'You have walked the path of patience and you now know
what to expect. We are watchers. Our eyes are everywhere and we must be patient
and quiet else we may miss what could be harmful. Can you sit still quietly and
wait for just the right moment, then open your eyes with a fury and act with all
the energy you have cultivated? Timing is everything, and without patience you
cannot be sensitive to timing. You have shown your patience here and we believe
you are ready to walk the [next path].<br>
<br>
You say, 'what is the next path?'<br>
<br>
a greater spirit says 'You know trust and patience. But before we can allow you
to act in our name, we must know that when you do decide to act, you will make
the right choices. We must ask that you now walk the path of wisdom. You must
walk to the great plains and search out one of us. He is a wanderer, and it is
his nature to drift with the winds and weather doing what he can to ensure
understanding and longevity to all that respect their home. He will not be easy
to find, though, and you must remember what you have learned down here to
succeed in finding him. When you do, give him this gem and follow his
instructions.</font></p>

Go to West Karanas.&nbsp; Find a wandering spirit.&nbsp; He is small and looks
like a wisp.&nbsp; Make sure the zone knows you are looking for it and it helps
greatly to have a tracker with you.&nbsp; When you find it, hail it.<br>
<br>
You say, 'hail a wandering spirit'<br>
<br>
a wandering spirit stops and flashes brightly for a moment. It seems to be
regarding you with interest.<br>
<br>
Now give the sparkling gem from Erud's Crossing to the spirit.<br>
<br>
a wandering spirit says 'Oh, it is you, shaman! Good! You must hurry before it's
too late. Go now to the Mountains they call Rathe and find them! They need your
help quickly! They will know you when they see you and instruct you on how you
can help, but you must hurry!</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana,Arial" size="2">Next go to the Rathe Mountains.&nbsp;
Find Tabien the Goodly at 6300, 1550.&nbsp; This is near the stone with the eye
on it.</font><font face="Verdana,Arial" size="2"><br>
<br>
You say, 'hail Tabien the Goodly'<br>

Tabien the Goodly says 'Oh thank Marr you are here, (your name) . I was beginning to
think I would be abandoned in my time of need. I have a [task] for you to
complete in the name of my patron Mithaniel Marr.<br>
<br>
You say, 'what task?'<br>
<br>
Tabien the Goodly display his shield that must once have been shining and regal
but is now scoured in cuts, dents, and chipped paint. He says, 'This shield is
known as Marr's Promise. It is a sacred relic that was actually used by one of
Mithaniel's angels on the Plane of Valor. Its value to our church is
immeasurable and I have been charged with the protection of it. However, a
patriarch of the false god, Bertoxxulous, is after my shield and me. He must be
stopped! Please, destroy him and bring me proof of his death.<br>
<br>
Kill Tabien (around level 32) and get his shield, Marr's Promise.

<p><font face="Verdana,Arial" size="2">The other person is Glaron the

You say, 'hail Glaron the Wicked'<br>
<br>
Glaron the Wicked says 'Are you the one they sent to help our cause? I should
have known they would send a green witch doctor to serve Bertoxxulous and
myself. Very well, you will have to suffice. I have a [task] you must fulfill if
you wish to know the blessing of my god and impress your masters.<br>

Glaron the Wicked brandishes a long, wicked-looking bone dagger and there is a
horrid, diseased stench as soon as he unsheathes it. He draws another blade,
shorter and wider than the first, of blackened bone with a larger than normal
hilt, obviously for defense. He says, 'This festering blade is called Woe, and
this scorched one is called Envy. They were created on the Plane of Decay by
Bertoxxulous' own hands. He has judged me worthy of the protection of such holy
relics. However, there is one in these very mountains who seeks to destroy these
relics. End this idiot follower of Marr's life and bring me proof.'<br>

to be done. Both paragons had lost sight of their virtures to protect the items
given to them. The mere protection of these material belongings was not as
important to Mithaniel Marr or Bertoxulous as it was that they act with
righteousness in their minds and purpose in their hearts. You saw this and acted

place. Where there is no spirituality, we are weak. The lost city in the middle
of this jungle is a great void of belief not only absent of spirituality, but
actually draining it from others. We are here to neutralize that void. The void
is like the sky, and nothing escapes its gaze. If it senses us, it will drain us
away and sometimes it turns our minds, making us [like the wasichu], crazy for
things with no meaning.<br>

Spirit Sentinel says 'Yes, there are some of us who have turned their backs on

they became shrouded in a darkness we could not peer through. The point-ear was
a powerful being and we soon lost their trail. We have no idea where he could be
now. Although, after all these centuries, he has no doubt been gathering and
cultivating his wealth and power. He must be an incredibly influential being at

him, go to the ramp leading to the castle.&nbsp; Don't go up the ramp, instead
go to the back at the base of the ramp.&nbsp; There will be four normal wolves
and a black dire in the middle.&nbsp; If the four wolves are green then you can
pull the black dire alone.&nbsp; The wolf is level 45 but is much harder to kill
then a regular 45 beast due to the fact that he is a shadowknight.&nbsp; He is
very magic resistant so nukers will not be very useful.&nbsp; Have a damage
absorbing shield on the tanks for the Harm Touch.&nbsp; To kill him, you will
need one full group consisting of three tanks, a cleric, and an enchanter.&nbsp;
Once he is dead, loot his pelt.</font><font face="Verdana,Arial" size="2">
<br>
<br>
Spirit Sentinel begins to weep softly as he sees the pelt, battered and bloody.
After a few moments, he says, 'We can only hope his passing was quick and
painless. The Dire was powerful and yet you overcame him. Always remember that
when you became [Heyokah], it was the passing of a noble, yet misguided being
that allowed you to do so. You should hold a special place in your heart for him
and what he was in life. To help you remember him, we will fashion this pelt
into a pair of boots and give them to you. With every step you take, you must
think on the Dire, else his death be in vain forever.'<br>

He will then give you Black Fur Boots.&nbsp; They have the same effect as the
Journey Man Boots and some very nice stats.<br>

From now on, you are a direct link between the spirits and man. Whether your
goals are to help us or master us, you are welcomed. Though there is little time
for celebration. Do you feel the darkness of this place, the forest? To eyes not
trained to see beyond physical appearances, it seems like any other forest. But
you know, as do we, of the mantle over the city threatening all of us. We must
[rub it out].<br>
<br>
You say, 'how do we rub it out'<br>
<br>
Spirit Sentinel says 'There are many such mantles scarring the universe and each
is very different from the last. Removing them requires that we learn how they
were created and go about reversing the damage done. We cannot enter under the
mantle for long which is why we search out Heyokah such as yourself. We need you
to enter the city and find out what you can about the [city's demise]. We hope
you will do this for the cause of balance but if you desire none but your own
power, we shall grant that as well<br>
<br>
You say, 'what about the city's demise?'<br>
<br>
Spirit Sentinel says 'It was known as Torsis. During its history it amassed
great wealth and power yet it eventually crumbled. No one understands what
happened. The men of the world ask themselves how a nation as successful as
Torsis could ever fall. Some blame plague, internal unrest, the constant
encroachment of the forest, and marauding bands of monsters but we alone know
what happened. Just as Tabien and Glaron lost sight of their spiritual paths, so
did Torsis. Without the awe and inspiration of that which was greater than
themselves, they eventually withered away. The mantle was born long before the
last days, though, and what we need to learn is [how it all began].<br>

Spirit Sentinel says 'Excellent! Go into the city and gather what evidence you

Now go to the City of Mist.&nbsp; You will need 6 items.&nbsp; The items are
Merchant's Letter, Priest's Diary, Personal Diary Page, Written Announcement,
Crier's Scoll, and Student Log.<br>
<br>
Five of these items are random drops off of skeletons, golems, and goos close to
the zone.&nbsp; The Student Log is dropped off of a Spectral Courier.&nbsp; This
is a level 34 mob.&nbsp; Here is how you pull him, posted on the Allakhazam
boards by Jolariss:</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana,Arial" size="2">The best spot to find the courier is in
the stables area. More specifically, when the courier was up it was in one of
two buildings. When you turn south from pool area (ie past the bridge and gate)
you enter a little area with two buildings to your left and an opening to your
right. The two buildings to your left (they have broken down beds in them)
contain monsters that WILL AGGRO ON YOU THROUGH THE WALL so if its your first
time there only walk forward a little ways until you hear a door click - you
will have pulled anywhere from 1-4 mobs so be ready. The courier can spawn in
the first building on the left. However, once you clear these two buildings you
can check the other spot where I saw the courier most often (80% of the time I'd
estimate). Enter the opening to the right and then open the first door on the
right - you will pull 2-3 mobs, hopefully one is the courier. On an average 6
hour camp pulling the stables I usually saw the courier about 2-3 times. -Thanks

I heard last night that there was some kind of commotion at the castle. Guards
were shouting, spells went off throughout the halls and many died. Some say
there was an assassination, some say a band of froglocks attacked under the
command of a dragon, some even say there was divine intervention. I have no idea
why any god would strike against Lord Rak'Ashiir. He is the paragon for the
cause of Cazic-thule. I hope whatever it was sticks to attacking the castle and
not my shop though.<br>

of the event and the High Scale will be present to judge various contests of
skill in arms. Booths will be set up selling various wares and food to all.

The list should all be in order except for the swatches of silk. I won't need
such a large order in this quarter. Her Divinity Drian made it known to me that
they would not need as many new robes this coming season as &quot;none were
quite ready to don them.&quot; My colleagues have all been confirming that the
church is buying less and less these days. It seems Rak`Ashiir has decided the
royal donation to be cut. However I'm sure we'll find new customers soon and our
orders will be back to normal shortly.<br>

Hear all Torsis! It is with great regret that we inform you of our Queen,
Neh'Ashiir's disappearance. Our best scouts have begun searching the surrounding
countries for her trail. The lord Rak'Ashiir also authorized the hire of
mercenaries to venture into Froglock Territories to search for traces of the
Queen. All interested parties should report to the royal Quartermaster's office.
Fear not citizens, our Queen will be found. Wisdom guide us.<br>

Well it appears our Lord Rak'Ashiir in his &quot;wisdom&quot; has cut our
church's donation yet again. He claims it is to bolster the ranks of our
garrison as many were wiped out during the Froglock incursions. However, I see
more and more soldiers everyday, more that I ever have. And they are all
equipped in the best armors the city's smiths can craft. This along with the
recent replacement of our Bishop Screks with that coin grubber biliaz leads me
to suspect our King is planning on all but destroying the church entirely. I
don't understand it, perhaps his missing Queen has driven him mad.<br>

Missed mass again today. This is the third time this week now. It is a worthy
sacrifice however as I was able to attend the Master's National Coin exchange
class. Perhaps the clergy will change the time of their masses, then I'll be
able to attend regulary. Although with the appointment of the new Arch Priest it
appears mass may be discontinued altogether. I honestly hope so. I could attend
many more classes as well as spend more time rubbing elbows with merchants at
the bazaars. I think I'll have to miss tomorrow's mass as well. I heard the
Laughing Leech Guild is taking members again.<br>

While you are in City of Mist, loot the High Scale Icon off of the floor.&nbsp;
You will need this later in the quest and it will save lots of time.&nbsp; Here
are some instructions on how to get the High Scale Icon from Belgar's Ultimate
Guide to Alchemy:</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana,Arial" size="2">Go into City of Mist.&nbsp; Go across the
bridge.&nbsp; Open the gate.&nbsp; Turn right.&nbsp; Go straight forward through
2 arches.&nbsp; In the last room you will find a temple with a waterfall running
down its side.&nbsp; Stay in that courtyard of temple, and pull skeletons, etc.,
from the first door you see at the base of the temple.&nbsp; Open the door.
Inside is another door directly in front of you, do not open this door, it leads
to top of temple. Look instead to the right, where three skeletons spawn. Pull
these skeletons to courtyard and kill them.&nbsp; Go back into door, head right
and ye will see a room set below ground level with three phantoms in it,
standing on a raised dais. Pull and kill these phantoms. There are two doors
beside the dais, one opening to the left and one opening to the right. Choose
the left door. Inside is a small room with no monsters inside, and a small bag
on the floor in the left corner. Click on the bag, you now have the High Scale
Icon. Gate out.&nbsp; Using Invisibility to Undead potion (Unlife Awareness)
will get you past the last three skeletons and phantoms. They will still scowl
at you, ready to attack, but it is a bluff. They will NOT be able to see you.Be
warned, however, as the golems of the area can see through Invisibility to
Undead, and you may run across a couple on the way to the temple area. -Thanks

in the right direction. Hmmm...this is interesting. It appears the disappearance
of the first queen may have caused Rak'Ashiir's faith to decline. From there,
the first King Rak laid down the groundwork for the city's eventual demise. We
need to learn what happened to the queen. Perhaps bringing this knowledge to the
King's now cursed form will lift the mantle. We've learned that the last lord of
Torsis, Ghiosk, was a bit of a historian. Find him and see what you can learn
about the queen. Take what you find to my brother here In the jungle beneath the

<br>
Book 1 -- Historic Article, it identifies as &quot;A Book From Ghiosk's
Collection&quot;<br>
<br>
Neh Ashiir's disappearance will always be cloaked in mystery. We of Torsis have
a saying that goes &quot;Neh`s chances&quot;. We all know this is used to define
an innumerable variable but not many know of its relation to the event in the
early years of our fair city. For as many people as there were in Torsis there
were that many theories regarding Ne Ashiir's disappearance. Others say there
were political tensions between the queen and her lord, so much so that she had
to leave to escape death. And for good measure a few pointed to the stars and
said that people from beyond the sky took her. One thing all agreed upon however
is that the relationship between the royal couple was decaying. Political
scrutinizers noted small personal habits between the two implied a separation of
intimacy during their public appearances. Many even tie the highly publicized
Crusade of Kim into the disappearance of Neh as Kim left the city only a few
weeks before. It is recorded in many texts that the visage of Rak`Ashiir
reflected his dispair over his wife's vanishing although it is a well know fact
that it was mostly an act played by the King to keep up his illusion of
nobility. Perhaps one day we will find the truth but at this point it would mean
little to the public.<br>
<br>
Book 2 -- Head Housekeeper's Log, identifies as &quot;A book From Ghiosk's
Collection&quot;<br>
<br>
1. New wash basis must be aquired. Servant Hujin will see the Quartermaster and
place the order tomorrow.<br>
2. The chandelier in the main hall was finaly repaired tonight. Payment must be
sent to the to the contract holder tomorrow.<br>
3. Advisor Snith ordered that I personal find and acquire 3 dozen finely made
vials. What they are for he would not explain and was very firm that I do this
as quickly as possible. Best to make haste to fulfill the order, rumors abound
of the Advisor's mastery of the arcane.<br>
4. We've been low on candles for the last week. There is no explanation for the
shortage of wax says our civilian contract holder. Perhaps I should send a
Palace Reaver escort with the next pick up crew. The craftsman may have the
intelligence to figure the symbolism.<br>
5. It is imperative that we return the High Scale's Icon to the church as
discretely as possible. If Rak Ashiir returns from his journey early and
discovers it was found in the royal bedroom it may prove disastrous. I cannot
decide whether to place it ourselves with help of our Black Guard, or to
approach one of our contacts in the church. The less people that know of this
better. It might be prudent to ..remove.. the servant who found it within the
sheets.<br>
<br>
Book 3 -- Crusades of the High Scales, identifies as &quot;A Book from Ghiosk's
Collection&quot;<br>
<br>
Throughout the history of the High Scale it was common for the knights to
practice complete celibacy. It wasn't until the controversial Kim was given the
hallowed title that contact between sexes became tolerated. While Kim wasn't the
mightiest of the High Scales he was able to achieve many great victories in the
name of our Lord of Fear. One being the battle know as the Bone Rending when Kim
lost his fabled whip. Thriaxis' Tail, and was still able to defeat scores of his
enemies using his hands only. Before this battle many believed Kim could not
fulfill his duties as a leader and patriot for the people. However Kim's might
and his lecture on the use of females in religious crusade and duty convinced
the puclic that celibacy had its place in divinity but non-celibacy also had a
place and value within the church. A shrine depicting Kim among many women was
constructed in remembrance of his controversial reign although his corpse was
never brought back for burial as it was lost far across the ocean among distant
brothers in faith<br>

first human Heyokah. One of the most destructive wasichu of Norrath, Miragul, as
he is known, had been traveling the world searching out all known magic.
Wherever he went, he discovered and experimented with all forms of dangerous
magic. Most of the world cannot even fathom what the Arch Necromancer was
capable of. He had haphazardly discovered a way to directly create a mantle of
negative spiritual energy similar to what curses Torsis. He himself had willed
into existence one of these [black holes].<br>
<br>
You say, 'What of thease Black Holes'<br>
<br>
Spirit Sentinel says 'Miragul often retreated to the frigid northlands to
experiment in solitude. It was here that he created a black hole. Unfortunately
for the small tribes of men who made the northlands their home, this new black
hole threatened not only their livelihood but their entire existence. The mantle
was so powerful it not only drained the spiritual energy of everything within
its gaze, it also drained the life force as well. The tribes were threatened
with complete annihilation. But one [powerful shaman] stepped forward and struck
against Miragul's mantle.<br>
<br>
You say, 'What powerful shaman?'<br>
<br>
Spirit Sentinel says 'Thalger had been the first to pass our tests and the
timing was lucky indeed. We supplied him with materials needed to construct a
weapon that could pierce the very fabric of the [cosmos]. First, was the
sharpened shoulder blade of an ancient lion matriarch. Then Thalger found a
young sapling for the shaft and shaped it over the course of 45 days using
nothing but his fingernails. He then split the top of the flexible shaft, lodged
the blade into place and bound them together with the tanned entrails of an ox.
Finally, he adorned the spear with the magical feathers of a an aviak elder.<br>
<br>
You say, 'What of the cosmos?'<br>
<br>
Spirit Sentinel says 'Miragul's casting was strong but it was a force brought
into existence. This force was positive in nature, the opposite of nothingness.
Even though it worked like a void, it was still created by an imposition of
will. We figured that if we could rupture the planar boundary and create enough
anti-existence or non-matter, the mantle might destroy itself. Thalger
volunteered immediately to pierce the mantle as no spirits could even get close
to it. In one act of devotion and singular purpose, Thalger rode the wind far
above the land and with one colossal arch ripped a [breach] across the planes.<br>
<br>
You say, 'What of the breach?'<br>
<br>
Spirit Sentinel says 'The tear in the fabric of existence created enough
negative material to cancel out Miragul's abomination. Thalger's strike was so
perfect that he cut just enough planar material to destroy the mantle and
nothing else. Unfortunately, Thalger himself was lost in the process. All that
was left was the spear that fell from the heavens to the ground where we
recovered it. We have kept it since then and now we wish you to have it. When
you strike with it, you must have the same singularity of purpose as did Thalger
when he defeated Miragul's mantle.<br>
<br>
Thank you, Heyokah Golan.<br>
<br>
<br>
You will receive the Spear of Fate.</font></p>
