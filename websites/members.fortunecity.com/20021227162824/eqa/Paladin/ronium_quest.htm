<p align="center"><b><u><font face="Verdana" size="6">Bar of Ronium</font></u></b></p>
<p align="left" style="margin: 0"><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">It is given
out by Lord Searfire in Solusek Temple.&nbsp; For him to talk to you, you must
have amiable or high faction with him.&nbsp; To raise faction there are three
things you can do.&nbsp; In South Ro, you will find an Orc and an Erudite,
standing in a tent by the southeast wall.&nbsp; To raise faction with the Temple
of Solusek Ro, either give the Erudite 30 gold or give the Orc 4 dervish
Cutthroat Rings at a time.&nbsp; These rings are obtained by hunting in North Ro
at the Dervish Camps.&nbsp; The Dervishes, which are at these camps and drop the
rings are level 10-16.&nbsp; The other way to raise faction is to hunt shadowmen
in West Commons or South Karanas.&nbsp; But if you are not a high level, they
are hard to solo and single pull.&nbsp; Once you have high enough faction to
talk with him, he will give you a Sol Cauldron.&nbsp; This is what you will be
combining your ingredients for the bar of Ronium.&nbsp; In this Cauldron you
must combine, Soil of the Underfoot, 2 Enchanted Bars of Platinum, Sands of Ro,
one Mistmoore Granite, and one Melatite.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></b></p>
<p align="left" style="margin: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left" style="margin: 0"><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">The Soil of
the Underfoot is obtained by giving Priestess Ghalea in the Kaladim Cleric
Guild, 4 fairie dusts found most commonly in Greater Faydark.&nbsp; The problem
with this is that killing fairies hurts faction that you need to have to
complete the Epic Quest later on.&nbsp; To get around this, you can either buy
the dusts from other players, or have an alternate kill them and transfer the
dusts to your Ranger.&nbsp; After you have the dusts, there is another faction
problem.&nbsp; Before handing the dusts into the Priestess, you must have
amiable faction and if you are a Ranger, you faction will probably suck with the
Kaladim Cleric Guild unless you have raised it somehow before.&nbsp; To raise
it, you must give the dwarf at the Paladin Guild, bone chips until your faction
is sufficient.&nbsp; Hand in the dusts for the Soil of the Underfoot.</font></b></p>
<p align="left" style="margin: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left" style="margin: 0"><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">The Enchanted
Bars of Platinum are found by giving a 34 or high level enchanter two bars of
platinum which can be bought at any jeweler store for around 100-110 platinum
depending on your charisma.</font></b></p>
<p align="left" style="margin: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left" style="margin: 0"><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">The Sands of
Ro drop off of Sand Giants in Oasis of Marr.&nbsp; Sand Giants are approximately
level 29-35.&nbsp; You can either get in a Sand Giant group or try and solo them
if you are high enough level.&nbsp; You can also buy these from players and
sometimes even from vendors such as the gypsies if some Sands of Ro have been
sold to them recently.</font></b></p>
<p align="left" style="margin: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left" style="margin: 0"><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">The Mistmoore
Granite is found off of Gargoyles (Sneering, Jeering, Flouting, Leering, and
Grinning) in Mistmoore, but mostly just the Jeering and Leering types.&nbsp;
They are found in the castle area, especially right at the entrance of the
Ballroom and outside the Castle close to the ramp toward the cemetary
area.&nbsp; You will need two Mistmoore Granites, one for the bar of Ronium, and
one for the actual quest.</font></b></p>
<p align="left" style="margin: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left" style="margin: 0"><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Melatite can
be bought off of jewelers or found off of Clockworks within Solusek A.</font></b></p>
<p align="left" style="margin: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left" style="margin: 0"><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Combine your
Soil of the Underfoot, the two enchanted bars of platinum, Sands of Ro, one
Mistmoore Granite, and your Melatite to make your Bar of Ronium.&nbsp; </font></b></p>
