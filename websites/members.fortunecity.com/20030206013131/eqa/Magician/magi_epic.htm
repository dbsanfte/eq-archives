to Norseh of Guild Reconstructed from E'ci Server for
being the first Mage to obtain The Orb of Mastery.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px; MARGIN-TOP: 0px">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The quest starts out in Lake Rathetear.&nbsp; Go to Rykas
(+967.70, -665.27).</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">You say, &quot;hail Rykas&quot;</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Rykas says, &quot;Greetings, I am Rykas, chronicler of
knowledge. I have journeyed all throughout the lands of Norrath, and I have
learned many tales of adventure from people I have encountered during my
travels. I have learned of legends known and unknown to most mortals. Are you in
search of knowledge?&nbsp;</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">You say, ''I am in search of knowledge''</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Rykas says, &quot;A small task is needed if you wish to learn
more.&nbsp; Do you wish to learn the tale of Magi'kot?&quot;</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">You say, &quot;I wish to learn of the tale of Magi'kot&quot;</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Rykas says, &quot;If you seek to learn the tale of Trilith
Magi'kot, your journey shall begin in the Commonlands. Search for Jahsohn Ak'sot
and give him this token. He will share some of the knowledge I have bestowed
upon him, and point you further down your path to Mastery. Bring me the Words of
Mastery, Power of the Elements, and the Words of Magi'kot....Then you shall
learn more about the power of the orb.&quot;</font></p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">You will then receive a Token of Mastery from Rykas.&nbsp; Take
the Token to Jahsohn Aksot in West Commonlands.&nbsp; His location is (+62.78,
+3639.68)&nbsp; He will wander a little so just get close to this and then use
the sense summoned spell to be directed to his pet.&nbsp; When you cast it make
sure you don't have a pet though or else you will be directed at your own
pet.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">You say, &quot;hail Jahsohn Aksot&quot;</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Jahsohn Aksot says, &quot;Greetings,
Ronaldor.&quot;</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">At this point, give the Tone of Mastery to Jahsohn and he will
reply, :</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;What is this?&nbsp; I cannot believe you found it!&nbsp;
Where did you get this?&quot;</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">You say, &quot;Rykas gave it to me.&quot;</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Jahsohn Aksot says, &quot;I have not heard of anyone speaking
that name out loud in years.&nbsp; Rykas once
shared a tale with me, though I have lived with fear in my mind ever since. He
told me afterwards that I did not have the balance I thought I had. Have you
come for the Words of Magi'kot?&quot;<br>
<br>
You say, 'Yes I have come for the words of Magi'kot.'<br>
<br>
Jahsohn Aksot says 'The Words of Magi'kot can only be shared with those
elementalists whose minds are of balance. The Words were separated into three
pieces by a high council of Magi who feared that the story would bring an end to
elementalists throughout Norrath. If you feel you wish to read from the sacred
Power of the Orb then an elementalis of such power should easily accomplish this
task.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
You say, 'What task.'</font></p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><br>
Jahsohn Aksot says 'Bring me the torn pages of Magi'kot. The first section can
be found in the depths of a tainted forest, warded by an angry lupine. It is
also rumored that one section is found in the haunted estate of a murderer, on a
many armed creature. The last may be found in the belly of an amphibian who
thirsts for blood.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The first page are dropped off of
an enraged dread wolf within Kithicor Woods.&nbsp; He is a common spawn and only
appears during night.&nbsp; The second page is dropped off of Tentacle Terrors
in The Estate of Unrest (Level 17-33).&nbsp; They only drop from the ones in
Unrest, not off of the ones in Najena.&nbsp; The third page is dropped off of a
Bloodthirsty Ghoul within Lower Guk.&nbsp; They are level 38-42 and spawn in the
same room as the frenzies do.&nbsp; Once you have the three items, go back to
Jahsohn Aksot and give them to him.&nbsp; He will say:</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;Rykas may have been right
about you, (your name) . Now, go find Walnan. Walnan was apprenticed to a very
powerful Mage. After her apprenticeship was complete, she wished to begin
teaching other beings of Norrath. Even those who knew nothing of the art! I do
not believe she was successful, though. Seek her out to further your tale. Good
luck in your journeys, Ronaldor!&quot;</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">He will then give you the Words of
Magi'Kot.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><br>
<br>
<br>
After killing the Gnome Mage at the Docks in Butcherblock (+1848, +624), you can use the spell
Sense Summoned to lead you to Walnan's pet.&nbsp; Walnan is a rare spawn so be
patient if she isn't around at the time.&nbsp; The Gnome Mage does not have to 
be killed to get Walnan to spawn.&nbsp; Walnan also doesn't always have a pet, 
so the most reliable way is to get a tracker.<br>
<br>
You say, 'hail Walnan'<br>
<br>
Walnan says 'Hello Ronaldor! I am Walnan, elementalist, summoner, wanderer, and
sometimes teacher. Might you be a elementalist in search of the truth?<br>
<br>
You say, 'I am in search of the truth'<br>
<br>
Walnan says 'The truth is something not all people can handle or understand. If
the truth of the elements is what you seek then the Power of the Elements shall
reveal all. Have you come to learn of Magi'kot?&nbsp;<br>
<br>
You say, 'I have come to learn of Magi'<br>
<br>
Walnan says 'Magi'kot was the most powerful elementalist of his age. He may have
been the most powerful mortal mage of all time, such was his mastery. He wished
to obtain infinite knowledge and wisdom in order to further expand the arcane
art of Summoning. Do you know what became of Magi'kot?&nbsp;<br>
<br>
You say, 'No'</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Walnan says 'Only a few
elementalists and followers outside our circle know what truly happened to
Magi'kot. Even now, many are fearful to speak of his name. If you truly wish to
continue, here is what you must do. Gather the Power of the Earth, warded by a
fae creature. Then seek the Power of Fire, held by an elemental. Next you will
need the Power of Wind, held by a twirling and prancing wanderer who has been
corrupted. Finally, the Power of Water, held by a ravenous beast who is the
minion of a fallen Sarnak. Bring them all to me, and I shall give you the Power
of the Elements.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The Power of Wind is dropped by
Gypsy Dancers in Mistmoore.&nbsp; They are level 25 and spawn inside the castle
close to the piano.&nbsp; Be careful when fighting them because they can
backstab up to 150 damage.&nbsp; The Power of Fire is dropped by Blazing
Elementals inside Solusek's Eye.&nbsp; They are also only level 25 but do have
an annoying damage shield which can be dispelled.&nbsp; They spawn near the
Reckless Efreeti.&nbsp; The Power of Fire also drops from Lava Elementals in 
Sola, more commonly than the Blazing Elementals.&nbsp; They are deeper inside 
the dungeon and are around level 35.&nbsp; The Power of Water is dropped by the Famished Ravener
within Kaesora.&nbsp; He is level 35 warrior.&nbsp; This guy spawns in place of the strathbone healer before the
drop off to the bottom floor occasionally.  Very annoying as all the mobs in the frenzy room will run straight for that
drop off when they are about to die. He also spawns reliably in the hut in the
cave by the library where he is the common spawn.&nbsp; Finally the Power of Earth is dropped by
Faerie Guards in Lesser Faydark.&nbsp; They range from level 14-25 and spawn all
over Lesser Faydark.&nbsp; Once you have obtained all four Powers, return to
Walnan and give them to him:<br>
<br>
Walnan says 'The arcane art of Summoning is derived from the power of the
elements which surround us. Continue your journey across the Ocean of Tears. In
a dark fortress, you should find Akksstaf lurking about. Be wary, but tell him
that you seek Magi'kot. Hurry now Ronaldor , you do not wish to miss the ship!&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Walnan will gives you Power of the Elements and then despawn until the next
magician comes along.<br>
</font></p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Head to Najena and find Akksstaff.&nbsp;
If he is not there you might have to wait a LONG time because his spawn time is
rumored to be 4-5 days long.&nbsp; His spawn location is unknown.&nbsp; <br>
</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">You say, 'hail Akksstaff'<br>
<br>
Akksstaff says 'What do you want?! Foolish (your race), I am in no mood to treat
with beggars. I have half a mind to turn Jobober here loose on you! Well, don't
keep me waiting, state your business or be off with you!&nbsp;<br>
<br>
You say, 'Tell me about Magi'kot.'&nbsp; If that doesn't work then say:<br>
<br>
You say, 'Tell me about Magi'<br>
<br>
Akksstaff says 'Ah, that I can help you with. Magi'kot was a powerful
elementalist, able to control the power of the elements which surrounded him. He
was not able to fully master the elements when I was learning from him, but soon
after my departure I heard rumors that he was going after the Orb of Mastery. At
the time, I did not feel he was ready to harness all the elements, but Magi'kot
listened to no one. He was in search of power beyond any held by a mortal. Do
you wish to hear more?&nbsp;<br>
<br>
You say, 'I wish to hear more'<br>
<br>
Akksstaff says 'Then bring me the torn pages of Mastery, there are four pages
that can be found upon the women In this keep, though have a care, Najena's
followers guard her treasures carefully, and delight in punishing trespassers.'</font></p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The four torn pages are all
dropped off of Female Dark Elf Magician in Najena.&nbsp; Nothing is known about
this person. Additionally the pages are available from the Temple of Cazic Thule
off the alligators that spawn in the sewer section there.&nbsp; For some reason
these two mobs have the same loot table entries so if Najena is camped (or
driving you made) you can switch to CT.&nbsp; Once you have all four pages:</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Akksstaff says 'Very well. Take
these words back to that shriveled old gnome, Rykas, if you wish to complete
this quest. Now leave me, (your name) , it sickens me to be this cordial for so
long. And Jobober needs exercise. Go!'&nbsp; She will give you Words of Mastery:</font></p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Now go back to Rykas in Lake
Rathetear and give him the three items you received from the previous quests,
The Words of Magi'kot, the Power of the Elements, and the Words of
Mastery.&nbsp; He will then give you the Power of the Orb:</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Rykas says 'I see that you have 
completed the quest I laid before you. That speaks well of your dedication, yet 
you do not realize your journey has just begun. Study this tome.</font></p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;An Elementalist's power
comes from the Orb of Mastery. The Elements of Earth, Fire, Wind,
and Water are contained within the Orb. The Master of Elements hold the Orb.&nbsp;
He can be found in the Plane of Air. No mortal has
been able to contain the true power of the Orb. Trilith
Magi'kot presented himself to the Master of Elements and the Orb of Mastery. The power of elements brought agony to his mind
and body. Magi'kot was not of Balance.&nbsp; Fire
burned his eyes unto blindness, Wind put
his mind into a spin, Earth entered his
body and aged him like the mountains, and finally, Water
washed his memories of mortal life away. Failing
his test, the Orb exacted its terrible price, and now Magi'kot is part of the
Orb.&nbsp; The bearer of this tome should
seek out the Master of Fire and present it to him, for
there is much left to be revealed.&quot;</font></p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Now, go to Skyfire Mountains and
find Jennus Lyklobar.&nbsp; This can be done by using the Sense Summoned spell.<br>
<br>
You say, 'hail Jennus Lyklobar'<br>
<br>
Jennus Lyklobar says 'Hello and well met, (your name)! Humans like you don't
often come here.. Do you come seeking what I possess? Fire, fire, fire and fire
is mine! I surround myself with fire, I bathe in fire, I consume fire, I am the
Master of Fire! Hahahaha, but I digress. Have you come for the element of Fire,
seeking to fall to the same fate as Trilith Magi'kot?&nbsp;<br>
<br>
You say, 'I wish to obtain the element of fire'</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><br>
</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><br>
Jennus Lyklobar says 'The Element of Fire I can provide you, but you must prove
you are able to contain its power. Bring me the Torch of the Elements now kept
by a doomed lord of merchants, the burning embers from a notable member of
wurmkind who can be found a short journey from here and a blazing wand, which
you should be familiar with. And you must surrender the tome Rykas gave you. But
I think you would be happier if you stayed with me and learned more of the
beauty of the one true element, FIRE! FIRE! Hahahahahahah!</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The Torch of Elements is dropped
off of Neh'Ashirr within the City of
Mist.&nbsp; He is a level 53 monster thats takes a serious raid to kill.&nbsp;
The Burning Embers come from Nezekenza in the Burning Woods.&nbsp; If you go to
Nezekezena's spawn location (about -450, -2550 in Burning Woods) and kill
everything in sight, eventually Nez or his placeholders will start spawning with
a cycle time of 90 seconds. People have evidenced acquiring Burning Embers at a
rate of 1 or 2 in a few hours' time with this method.&nbsp; Nezekenza is thought
to be around level 50.&nbsp; The Blazing Wand can be found off of Undertow in
Kedge Keep.&nbsp; This level 49 seahorse looking wizard, can be found at the
temple (+250, -250).&nbsp; He spawns every 8 hours or atleast his placeholders
do.&nbsp; Take these three items and the Power of the Orb from Rykas, and give
them to Jennus Lyklobar.&nbsp; He will give you the Element of Fire.<br>
<br>
<span style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #000000"><br>

<br>
Use the spell Sense Summoned to lead you to Tiblner Milnik's pet within Firiona
Vie.&nbsp; He has been seen wandering the cliff.&nbsp; Look for a High Elf Male
wearing a brown robe.<br>
<br>
Tiblner Milnik says 'Huh? What? Oh, you speak so fast, it took me a moment. I
have become used to the slow and stately conversation the Earth holds, where a
thought can span aeons. I am the Master of Earth, you know. Though I'm usually
too humble to say this, that makes me the most powerful mortal in Norrath, as
everyone knows that Earth is the only REAL Element, all else must give way
before its power. Water is absorbed by it, Air is ignored by it, and Fire is
contained in it. But you know all these things, I am sure. Are you interested in
obtaining the Element of Earth? I know Magi'kot was, but we know what happened
to him, don't we?&nbsp;<br>
<br>
You say, 'I am interested in obtaining the Element of earth'</font></p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Tiblner Milnik says 'Combining the
following items can bring the Element of Earth together. Obtain the Staff of
Elemental Mastery:Earth, held by the minions of the Prince of Hate, The Dirt of
Underfoot found on Slix something or the other, and of course, I shall need the
Broom of Trilon and the Shovel of Ponz. Bring all these things, and I shall show
you what a true Master of Earth can do, and gift you with the Element of Earth.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Staff of Earth drops off Magi 
P'Tasa in Hate. He is on a rare pop out of several (12) places, so there can be 
multiples of him up, although I have never seen more than 2. The drop rate is 
about 1 in 4. One uber group can do him, although you probably need an all out 
raid.&nbsp; The Dirt of Underfoot is found on Slixin Klex.&nbsp; It is
a common drop.&nbsp; He won't be very difficult finding for he spawns (-500,
-1100) just north of the glowing meteor every 22 minutes.&nbsp; He is a level 50
warrior and has 11000 hitpoints.&nbsp; Both the Shovel of Ponz and the Broom of
Triton are subquests.&nbsp; Both quests are given by Vira in the Temple of
Solusek Ro.&nbsp; For the Shovel of Ponz you need a shovel dropped from level
25-32 alligators within Feerrott, the toes of a hill giant from a hill giant,
a gargoyles eye from gargoyles in Ocean of Tear, and a ruby from gem selling
vendors.&nbsp; For the Broom of Triton you need a broom from alligators in Feerrott,
the toes of a cyclops, the feathers of a griffon, and a star ruby from gem
selling vendors.&nbsp; For these quests you need to have good faction with the
Temple of Solusek Ro which can be obtained by killing Shadow-Men.&nbsp; Hand the
four items in to Tiblner Milnik and you will be rewarded with the Element of
Earth.</font></p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Go to Jinalis Andir in Dagnor's
Cauldron.&nbsp; His location is -447.00, -2044.00.<br>
</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">You say, &quot;Hail Jinalis Andir.&quot;</font></p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Jinalis Andir says 'Let us
dispense with pleasantries, Ronaldor . I am Jinalis, as you know. I imagine you
want to control the Elements. The Element of Water, which I possess, is the most
powerful of the Elements. With it you can control the water which falls from the
Air, erodes the Earth, and extinguishes Fire. It is a pity you do not focus on
the Prime Element, but if you wish to follow that fool Magi'kot to your doom, I
will not stop you. Bring me the Staff of Elemental Mastery:Water held by the
last of the Kedge, the Tears of Erolisi held by a dirty and rotten officer
across the Blessed Deep, and finally, the Rain of Karana, found on a mighty
Giant in, where else, the Karanas.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The Staff of Elemental Mastery:
Water is dropped from Phinigel Autropos.&nbsp; The Phinigel
Autropos is a very hard level 50 Wizard.&nbsp; He can be taken out by around 2-3
groups that work well together.&nbsp; He enjoys dispelling people (usually your
enduring breath.)&nbsp; He is also very difficult to kill because he is guarded
by 6 guardians which can be hard to kill as well.&nbsp; (Level Needed)&nbsp; The
Tears of Erolisi are dropped from Captian Rottgrime.&nbsp; He is a level 55
warrior that spawns every 5 minutes at (+2471, +2138), near the outpost.&nbsp;
He is said to be 100% magic resistant but this is not confirmed yet.&nbsp; He
looks like an Iksar Skeleton.&nbsp; Killing the Captain isn't hard, you just
need lots of tanks and clerics. Casters who have pets can help, but I don't
think any other spells will be useful against him.&nbsp; Pulling him from the
outpost in the Overthere is difficult; the two times I was present, a dragoon
was pulled along with him. He is usually standing near the southeast corner of
the Outpost, along with six undead marines, who are level 50. You'll probably
want a monk to feign pull the Captain, and it will be much easier to do at night
when the dragoons are out on patrol (fewer things to aggro). I don't know the
exact method that was used however.&nbsp; You will take a Venril Sathir faction
hit for killing Rottgrime; apparently it's a pretty sizable one, so be careful
if you're used to being able to travel there (evil races and classes, for
example.&nbsp; The Rain of Karana is found off of Trabul Earthstrider located in
East Karana.&nbsp; He is a level 48 named hill giant that spawns very frequently
on Crag Hill.&nbsp; You just need lots of druids in that area with
tracking.&nbsp; Once you have the three items give them to Jinalis Andir and you
will receive the Element of Water.</font></p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Go to Plane of Air and seek Kihun
Solstin.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">
You say, 'hail Kihun Solstin'<br>
<br>
Kihun Solstin says 'So, you have made it this far. I am Kihun Solstin, the
Master of Wind. I control the unfettered Element like none other. As you should
have learned, Air is the most potent of Elements. It fuels Fire, Water is
comprised of it, and Earth cannot restrain it. Knowing this, do you seek the
Element of Wind?&nbsp;<br>
<br>
You say, 'I seek the element of wind'</font></p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Kihun Solstin says 'I will test
you then. In this wondrous plane of Air, find the Crown of Elemental Mastery,
and search the world below for an Elemental Binder, and a cloak fashioned from
the feathers of a Pegusus. Return them to me and I shall give you the Element of
Wind.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The Crown of Elemental Mastery is
dropped from the Sphinx on the 7th Island in Plane of Air.&nbsp; This is a
common spawn.&nbsp; The Elemental Binder is loot from Elemental Warriors in The
Hole which is connect to Paineel.&nbsp; They spawn near the entrance and are
level 38-42.&nbsp; The Binder is a semi-common drop.&nbsp; Finally, the Pegasus
Feather Cloak is a very rare cloak from the Pegasus, Quillmane in South Karanas.&nbsp;
Its too bad that once you get the cloak you almost immediately have to give it
away because this cloak gives the effect of Levitation when worn.&nbsp; Very
useful.&nbsp; Quillmane is a rare spawn level 30 warrior, but he can spawn
anywhere in the zone. Most commonly he is found in the interior of the zone,
away from the zone walls, but he can be out there, too. He wanders almost
constantly, and is killed almost instantly by any who see him (because the cloak
you need for the quest is All/All and has unlimited charges of Levitate...).
This sucks, but it means it takes some real effort to get the cloak.&nbsp;
Because Quillmane spawns randomly and wanders, the best way to get the cloak is
to go to South Karanas with as many high level rangers and druids as you can
gather. More than 5 would be overkill, since you want to be grouped with them
all. Basically, what you should do is summon your pet of choice, get a SoW, and
then run around the zone killing anything that wanders. Static spawns like the
Aviaks at their tower or the Tesch Mas Gnolls outside splitpaw, need not be
killed (Quillmane doesn't spawn there, and there will always be people camping
the Aviaks and Gnolls anyway). Anything else that wanders -- centaurs, wolves,
lions, elephants, aviaks, gnolls, treants (although there is a faction issue
there) -- is fair game. You want five trackers with you because they can always
home in on a mob and kill it, and they can do this constantly -- the instant
something shows up on tracking, they will go after it and kill it. And the
reason you want to be grouped is, if someone in your group does see Quillmane
and kills him, then you will be able to get to the corpse and loot it before it
opens up and some ninjalooter steals your cloak!&nbsp; Even one high-level
tracker with you can make this an easy enough camp. (To put it another way, one
tracker tracking and killing mobs, and Quillmane when he pops, is better than
wandering about hoping to encounter Quillmane by yourself!) If you have even one
or two ranger or druid friends who can help, then your life will become
immeasurably easier.&nbsp; Nevertheless, even with your entire guild scouring
the zone for Quillmane, expect to spend at least several hours on getting the
cloak.&nbsp; Give the three items to Kihun Solstin in the Plane of Sky.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Once you have given him the three
items you will receive the Element of Wind.&nbsp; Also, the Master of Elements
will spawn (Thought to spawn in the middle of the Quest Room in Plane of Sky but
unsure).&nbsp; Be sure to have all four elements when you hand in the three
items to Kihun.&nbsp; Give the four elements to the Master of Elements and he
will in return, give you the scroll Summon Orb of Mastery.&nbsp; Scribe this
spell and then summon your epic weapon.&nbsp; It is very useful that this is a
summon spell because if you accidentally delete it or something happens to it,
you just summon it again.</font></p>
