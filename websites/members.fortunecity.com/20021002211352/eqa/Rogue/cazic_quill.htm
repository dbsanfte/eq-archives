<p align="center"><b><font face="Verdana" size="6">Cazic's Quill Quest</font></b></p>
<p align="left"><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">This quest is a sub-quest of
the Ragebringer Quest for Rogues.&nbsp; Note that you might get the Cazic Quill
off of General V'Ghera in the final battle but it is a very rare drop. If he did
drop it, disregard this quest.&nbsp; If you do not get it follow the quest
below.</font></b></p>
<p align="left"><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">This from Safehouse: This quest
involves the named Vilinus the Small. He can be located in Western Karanas in
the bandit camp at location +340, -6700. Making him spawn will take some work.
First, be sure all bandits are in the camp. You must kill and continue to kill
the bandit which runs from the camp to the top of the hill until the
&quot;brigand&quot; spawns. The &quot;brigand&quot; is an ultra-rare spawn.
Leave the &quot;brigand&quot; alone, and at 11 p.m. game time Vilinus the Small
will spawn in his place.</font></b></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Vilinus asks for four robes.&nbsp;
Once you bring them back to him, he will reward you with Cazic's Quill.&nbsp;
The first robe is Robe of the Kedge.&nbsp; This is dropped off of the Phinigel
Autropos in Kedge Keep. The Phinigel
Autropos is a</b></font><b><font face="Verdana" size="2"> very hard level 50 Wizard.&nbsp; He can be taken out by around 2-3
groups that work well together.&nbsp; He enjoys dispelling people (usually your
enduring breath.)&nbsp; He is also very difficult to kill because he is guarded
by 6 guardians which can be hard to kill as well.&nbsp; (Level Needed)&nbsp; The
Robe of the Kedge is a very rare drop.&nbsp; You might have to do more than one
raid to get it.</font></b></p>
<p align="left"><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">The second robe is Robe of the
Ishva.&nbsp; This is dropped from the Ishva Mal in Splitpaw.&nbsp; He is a 36
hour spawn.&nbsp; He spawns in the Ishva Mal room with two guards on either side
of him.&nbsp; Because he is a necromancer, he casts many dots.&nbsp; You will
want to get your disease and poison resist up.&nbsp; He also has a complete heal
potion on him.&nbsp; This he will use.&nbsp; It can be interrupted.&nbsp; Note
that the Robe of the Ishva is not no drop and can be purchased for approximately
6,000-7,000 platinum.</font></b></p>
<p align="left"><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">The third robe is Shiny
Metallic Robes.&nbsp; These robes are dropped off of the Ghoul Archmagus.&nbsp;
He spawns in the Magi Room.&nbsp; To get there from the Dead Side Zone 1, go
down the small hallway at the zone, turn right and go down another hill.&nbsp;
Run through the small corridor until you come to water.&nbsp; Jump into the
water and swim to the right.&nbsp; You will come up at the bedroom.&nbsp; Take
the passage all the way to the left.&nbsp; Follow this until you come to a big
room with bats in it.&nbsp; Take the passage to the left of you.&nbsp; Next,
follow the wall to the right, past the Greater Ice Bone Skeletons.&nbsp; Until
you come to a group of steps with a bridge.&nbsp; Jump off the bridge to the
left.&nbsp; Go straight down a hallway and you will come to a jail.&nbsp; Keep
going straight down that hallway until you can turn to the right.&nbsp; Turn to
the right and follow that hallway to the magi room.&nbsp; For a map go to <a href="http://www.graffe.com"><font color="#BB3D2F">www.graffe.com</font></a><font color="#BB3D2F">.</font>
The magus is a 30 minutes spawn and has a placeholder which is usually a Kor
Ghoul Wizard or a Dar Ghoul Knight.&nbsp; He spawns 1 every 5 times.&nbsp; So
expect him to spawn once every 2 and a half hours.&nbsp; The rare drop is a
Shiny Metallic Robe which drops 1 every 6 times.&nbsp; If you get up early in
the morning and get into a group there I bet by the end of the day you will have
one.&nbsp; Note that the Shiny Metallic Robe is not no drop and can be purchased
for approximately 7,000 platinum.</font></b></p>
<p align="left"><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">The fourth and final robe is
the Robe of the Oracle.&nbsp; This is easily bought for 600 platinum in Greater
Faydark from player but can also be found off of the Oracle who is direction
straight forward from the docks on the Sister Isle.&nbsp; He is a level 40
wizard, who has hardly any hitpoints.&nbsp; He also has a level 40 paladin
guadian.&nbsp; Have a wizard friend come along with you.&nbsp; Have the wizard
root the guardian, and then kill the Oracle.&nbsp; Loot the Robe of the Oracle
and then have the wizard teleport you guys out of there.&nbsp; This way you
don't have to mess with the guardian.</font></b></p>
<p align="left"><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Turn in the four robes to
Vilinus the Small for Cazic's Quill.</font></b></p>
