<p align="center"><font size="6" face="Verdana"><b>The Earthcaller and Swiftwind
Quest</b></font></p>
<p align="center"><font size="4" face="Verdana"><b><u>The Start</u></b></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana"><br>
<font size="2">
First go to Telin Darkforest (Level 55) in Burning Woods.&nbsp; He roams near to
the Skyfire zone and has been sited at positive 3234 positive 2871.&nbsp; Ask
him &quot;what action&quot; and he will give you a note. If he doesn't, then
your faction is too low. Faction can be built up fast by doing the muffin-quest
in Freeport.<br>
Next, find Faelin Bloodbriar in Greater Faydark.&nbsp; Faelin spawns at +1500, 
+500.&nbsp; The placeholder is a roaming orc pawn that spawns at 6 minute 
intervals.&nbsp; The best tactic is to roam around.&nbsp; Once you do find her, give her the note and you
receive a ring. After giving her the note she depops.&nbsp; Giz X'Tin (Level 40)
is found in Kithicor near the path from West Commons to Highpass Hold. Give him
the ring and he gives you a dark metal coin. Giz roams along the path. After you
hand him the ring a level 50 Darkelf Reaver spawns and attacks you.&nbsp; Be
prepared and have Spirit of the Wolf cast on you so that you can run away.&nbsp;
Go back to Telin Darkforest and give him the Coin. He will give it back to you
as worn metal coin. He tells you to find Athele.&nbsp; Find Athele in East
Karanas.&nbsp; She can be found just north of the barbarian fishing village.&nbsp;
Give her the worn metal coin and receive a worn amulet.&nbsp; Give this amulet
to Sionae (spawns -2300, -930), then to Nuien (spawns -3650, -300) and finally
to Teloa (spawns -3800, -2860).&nbsp; When you give the amulet to Teloa the Dark
Elf Corruptor and two Darkelf Reavers (All around level 50) spawn.&nbsp; You
should have one of your druid friends stand on the hill east of the river (loc
-1500, -1000).&nbsp; He will depop after 10 seconds if not attacked so have the
druid kite the Corruptor over to you.&nbsp; You needn't worry about the Reavers,
they will head towards the four druids.&nbsp; Just kill the Corruptor and get
the tome.&nbsp; The Reavers will probably just kill the druids which is fine
because Athele will spawn in about one hour.&nbsp; Give Athele the tome and he
gives you an earthstained Note. Bring this to Ella Foodcrafter.&nbsp; Ella
Foodcrafter in Misty Thicket is this wanted women that wanders the zone. Give
her the earthstained note and she will tell you that she needs a mixture. She
will give you her mixing bowl. It is a Container so you need a free slot in the
Inventory. She also mentions some kind of ancient bowl that she needs.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Verdana"><br>
<br>
<font size="4"><b><u>The Hardened Mixture</u></b></font><br>
</font>
</p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">You must forage 4 items that you have to combine in Ella's
mixing bowl.&nbsp; Chilled Tundra Root from Everfrost Peaks.&nbsp; Sweetened
Mudroots from Misty Thicket.&nbsp; Speckled Moldy Mushrooms from Innothule
Swamp.&nbsp; Heartfruit from Greater Faydark.&nbsp; Go to these places and put
the &quot;Forage&quot; button into your hotkey, find a nice safe space and hit
forage continuously. This can take several hours so be prepared. When you get
the items, combine them in the bowl and you get a Hardened Mixture.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Verdana"><br>
<br>
<font size="4"><b><u>The Runed Bowl</u></b></font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><br>
<font size="2">
Go to the Chess Island in Timorous Deep.&nbsp; The level 57 spell Succor will
take you there, but it has been reported to drain your mana to about two bubbles
to use cautiously.&nbsp; Once you get there, ask Alrik Farsight (location
unknown) &quot;How do you make an ancient bowl?&quot;. He gives you a crushed
pot and sends you to Felwithe.&nbsp; Talk to Farios Elianos (location unknown)
in Felwithe South. If he doesn't respond to you then your faction with Keepers
of the Art is too low. You can build up faction fast with the batwing-quest in
Felwithe South. If Farios talks to you, give him the pot and you receive a
grocery list. He will give you the receipt for the bowl if you do a job for him.&nbsp;
Bring this grocery list to Merchant Nora (Location Unknown) in Felwithe north
and she gives you in return a bag of Provisions. Bring it to Farios and he gives
you the receipt for the ancient bowl.&nbsp; Head back to Alrik Farsight in
Timorous Deep . He will give you an ancient pattern when you give him the
receipt.&nbsp; The pattern says that you have to combine it with a piece of
enchanted clay and platinum speckled powder in a pottery wheel. NO skill in
pottery required.&nbsp; Platinum speckled powder can be obtained through another
sub quest. Forage a Rose of Firiona in Firiona Vie and give it to Merdan
Fleetwood (Location also Unknown) in Surefall Glades. The old wooden painting
that you receive has to be brought to the human skeleton (Level 40) that roams
the western part of Frontier Mountains.&nbsp; It was said to have been sighted
running from Burning Woods to the Dreadlands.&nbsp; He conned indifferently to
this certain person.&nbsp; Head back with the silver chained locket you got from
the skeleton to Surefall Glades and give it to Niera Farbreeze (Level 50). She
hands you the platinum speckled powder.&nbsp; Enchanted clay can be obtained
through Kinlo Strongarm in Kaladim's EverHot Forge. If you ask him &quot;what
mud&quot; and &quot;do it for me&quot; he will tell you that he would like to
have a colored axe for his service. He wants a Jade Reaver that can be found in
the City of Mist off of a Black Reaver who is about level 52. Hand Kinlo the axe
and you get the enchanted clay. I think that if you are KoS to the dwarves then
you can do this part invisible. Just go to the Everhot Forge and hand Kinlo a
Jade Reaver to get the clay.&nbsp; Now combine the pattern, clay and powder in
any pottery wheel to make the Rune Crested Bowl.</font></font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Verdana"><br>
<br>
<font size="4"><u><b>The Stones</b></u></font><br>
</font>
</p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Go Back to Misty Thicket and hand Ella Foodcrafter the hardened
mixture and the rune crested bowl. She will make for you a softly glowing stone
from it.&nbsp; Ella tells you to find one such as yourself. For the Druids this
means to seek out Foloal Stormforest (Location Unknown) in Firiona Vie.&nbsp;
Ask her &quot;are you one such as myself?&quot;, &quot;what answers?&quot; and
&quot;what about Venril Sathir?&quot;. She tells you to bring her the stone you
already have from Ella and the gem that can be found on Venril Sathir.&nbsp;
Kill Venril Sathir (-90, -777) in Karnor's Castle and loot the gem he drops.
Venril is a very tough level 55.&nbsp; He is only killed my strong guilds
because he is level 55, hits for 300 FAST, has a 1000+ life suck spell and has
two personal clerics how heal him whenever they get hurt.&nbsp; This guy is
extremely hard so you might want to be in a good group to do this part.&nbsp;
Give the gem and the softly glowing stone to Foloal Stromforest and get a warm
pulsating stone. Now this is the time where the quest splits up into the Druid
and the Ranger parts. Foloal tells you to take the stone and walk your path.&nbsp;
Apparently, this leads you back to Telin Darkforest in the Burning Woods.&nbsp;
Give him the warm pulsating stone.&nbsp; In return he will give you An Ancient
Sword.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
<p align="center"><font size="4" face="Verdana"><u><b>The Hammers</b></u></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Now head to The Hole which is a
zone adjacent to Paineel.&nbsp; Find Jaeil the Wretched (level 50) and have
enchanters mesmerize him.&nbsp; Also have a raid party in the room ready for
battle.&nbsp; Go behind Jaeil and give him the Shiny Tin Bowl.&nbsp; He will
scream at himself and then Jaeil the Insane will spawn.&nbsp; Now the raid party
goes into action and kills Jaeil the Insane.&nbsp; Loots from Jaeil the Insane a
Soulbound Hammer.&nbsp; Go to Erudin and find Mairee.&nbsp; She is in the
jewelry shop, by the bank.&nbsp; Give her the Soulbound Hammer and in return she
will give you the Dwarven Smiths Hammer.&nbsp; Now go to the Plane of Air and
kill the Essence Tamer.&nbsp; He spawns on the fourth island and drops the
Swirling Sphere of Color.&nbsp; Take the Dwarven Smiths Hammer and the Swirling
Sphere of Color and give them to Mairee.&nbsp; In return, she will give you the
Hammer of the Ancients.&nbsp; Go back to Kinlo Strongarm and give him the Hammer
of the Ancients.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
<p align="center"><font size="4" face="Verdana"><u><b>The Swords</b></u></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">This will cause (in a puff of
smoke) Usbak the Old to spawn and he will give you Small Bit of Mithril
Ore.&nbsp; Give Usbak the Old your Ancient Longsword and he will return to you
the new and improved Refined Ancient Longsword.&nbsp; Hand the Mithril Ore to
Kinlo to get the Refined Mithril Blade.&nbsp; Go back to the Burning Woods, to
Telin and give him the Refined Ancient Sword.&nbsp; This causes Faelin
Bloodbriar to spawn and Telin will give you back the Refined Ancient
Sword.&nbsp; So, give the Refined Ancient Sword to Faelin and she will enchant
it for you and return to you Swiftwind, the first epic weapon.&nbsp; At this
point she despawns after saying some stuff about how you have to kill Innoruuk
to rebalance the world.&nbsp; That is exactly what you are going to do.&nbsp; Go
to the Plane of Hate and kill Innoruuk.&nbsp; His location
is (-65, -196) and he spawns about once a week.&nbsp; He is a level 55 Wizard
with approx. 32246 hitpoints.&nbsp; He is a green looking man wearing
clothes.&nbsp; Loot the Shattered Emerald of Corruption.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p align="center"><font size="4" face="Verdana"><u><b>The End</b></u></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Take the Refined Mithril Blade and
the Shattered Emerald of Corruption to Xanthuus the treant in North Karanas.&nbsp;
In return he will give you the last epic weapon, the Earth Caller.</font></p>

FA Quest maintained by Crydee Ossiriand</font></a>.</font></p>
<p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Plane of Growth</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2"><br>
Although the Plane of Growth is not used for the quest, it does need special
mentioning.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Telin Darkforest [Faydark's Champion]</b><br>
Telin Darkforest is on Faydark's Champion faction. Any of the Kelethin Ranger
quests will give you faction with him. You can also kill orcs in Crushbone.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Giz X`Tin [unknown]</b><br>
He is mostly be on one of the Dark Elf Factions and will probably be less than
indifferent to you. If this is the case, cast Spirit of Wolf on yourself [to be
able to keep up with him] than sneak up behind him so that he will be
indifferent to you and then give him the ring. If you give him the ring, while
he /CONs dubious [or lower] to you, you will not get the coin to continue the
quest.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Dark Elf Corruptor and Dark Reavers in East
Karana [Dark Elf Warrior]</b><br>
Killing them will not impact faction with the Neriak Guards. This faction will
only be noteworthy to any Dark Elves [and to a lesser extent Trolls and Ogres]
that may wish to assist you with killing these.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Alrik Farsight [Keepers of the Art]</b><br>
To gain faction with Alrik Farsight, visit the Magician Guild in Felwithe [B]
and give Niola Impholder Bat Wings until she is amiable to you. If your faction
with Niola Impholder is so low that she doesn't give you faction when you turn
them in, stand behind her and use sneak to make her indifferent to you.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Kinlo Strongarm &amp; Usbak the Old
[unknown]</b><br>
If your faction with these dwarves is less than indifferent, you will need to
stand behind them and use sneak in order to be able to deal with them.</font></p>
