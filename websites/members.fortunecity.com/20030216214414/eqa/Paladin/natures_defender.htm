<p ALIGN="CENTER"><font face="Verdana" size="6">Natures Defender</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Quest Written by: Thorena the 
Wave Caller of Cazic Thule </font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Quest Editted by: Aline 
Griffonfeather</font></p>
<b>
<p ALIGN="CENTER"><u><font face="Verdana" size="4">Corrupter of Life</font></u></p>
</b>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Note: To complete this quest, you must be a 
High Elf or Half Elf Paladin that follows Tunare and is a Knight or Crusader 
meaning you must be 55+ for the Guardian to accept the items.&nbsp; This means 
you can get the items before then but to turn them in you must be 55+.</font></p>
<font SIZE="2">
<p><font face="Verdana">This quest starts off in the Plane of Growth and is 
given by Guardian of Takish. You don't have to talk to him until you get the 
items he requests.&nbsp; In other words, to save time, first get the items he 
requests and then go to Wakening Lands and talk to him.&nbsp; Also, this a deity 
based sword.&nbsp; You must be a worshiper of Tunare to receive the sword.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Go to Plane of Growth and find Guardian of Takish.&nbsp; 
He is in a small enclosed area in front of a door at -3243 +1233. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Guardian of Takish says 'Well met Thorena. It is indeed 
a wondrous day to be serving the lady Tunare. If you know of any templars or 
knights send them to me. <br>
<br>
You say, 'I am a knight' <br>
<br>
Guardian of Takish says 'Fortune smile upon me this day. It seems that the great 
corrupter and the Prince of Hate have spreading the seeds of corruption within 
this continent. Will you assist us to stop them? <br>
<br>
You say, &#145;I will assist you' <br>
<br>
Guardian of Takish says 'Seek out the corrupter of life in the plane of hate and 
slay him. He has been reported performing dark rituals upon various wildlife 
within the Wakening Lands during the late hours of night. Return to me any 
evidence that you may find. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Go to the Plane of Hate and on the second floor towards 
the back of the zone is the Corrupter of Life. He&#146;s a level 60 mob but if you 
can kill normal mobs on the second floor he&#146;s not too much tougher and will fall 
quickly. His spawn time is roughly every three days and he is always up after a 
server reset. He is in the form of a floating Spectre and has flurry attacks.&nbsp; 
Loot the Skull of the Corrupter of Life.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="CENTER">&nbsp;</p>
</font>
<p ALIGN="CENTER"><u><b><font face="Verdana" size="4">The Corrupted</font></b></u></p>
<font SIZE="2">
<p><font face="Verdana">You&#146;re looking for three mobs in this zone. They usually 
are all around the same loc, +54 +24. If they are all together, use harmony to 
pull them.&nbsp; These mobs seem to be fairly common spawns and are usually up 
unless someone has killed them recently.&nbsp; They drop the pieces you need 
every time. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">The first mob is a corrupted panther.&nbsp; It is level 
55 and can triple hit for 200.&nbsp; After being tash'd most magic spells will 
stick.&nbsp; You will need a full group of 55+ to kill him.&nbsp; The panther is 
a warrior.&nbsp; Loot the 
Corrupted Panther Skin off of it.&nbsp; The second mob, a Corrupted faun is 
around level 57.&nbsp; It doesn't have high magic resist to start with so after 
being tash'd, it can be chain-stunned and killed easily.&nbsp; If it is not 
stunned then you will need many clerics to heal the damage it does.&nbsp; The 
faun is a rogue.&nbsp; Loot 
the corrupted faun skin.&nbsp; The last mob is the hardest out of the three.&nbsp; 
It is called the corrupted unicorn and is level 60.&nbsp; She is a shadowknight 
and has a pet.&nbsp; She harm touches for 1000 damage +, so having pets to take 
this damage, or damage absorbent shields are very useful.&nbsp; She will also 
cast blindness, so don't freak out when it seems like your computer is screwed 
up.&nbsp; She double attacks for 350 and has extremely high magic resist that 
even tash doesn't help much.&nbsp; Once it is dead, loot the corrupted unicorn 
skin.&nbsp; All of these creatures are able to be pulled, but watch out, because 
all of them summon.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Take these items to Guardian of Takish and hand them in 
all at once. You will receive the Natures Defender.</font></p>
