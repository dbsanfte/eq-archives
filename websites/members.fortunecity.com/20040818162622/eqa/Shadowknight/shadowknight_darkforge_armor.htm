<p>The Darkforge Armor Quests are given out by two Undead Knights. There has
recently been another Undead Knight added so they split up the Quests. Be
careful that you give the components to the right Undead Knight. Make sure of
this by talking to them and making sure that the one you are giving the
components to offers that piece of armor.</p>
</font><b><u><font FACE="Verdana">
<p ALIGN="CENTER">The Decaying Armor</p>
</font></u></b><font FACE="Verdana" SIZE="2">
<p>For each of these quests, you will need pieces of Decaying Armor. The 
rareness is completely random. You are just as likely to get a breastplate as 
you are to get a bracer.&nbsp; The Decaying Armor drops from
Lizard Crusaders in the Temple Area of Ferrott. Get in a group on top of the
temple or behind a temple and you shouldn&#146;t have trouble getting pieces of
Decaying Armor. If you are a high level, (47+) then you can also camp the
Crusaders in the Avatar room where they spawn very commonly. You can also get
the Ravenscale Breastplate off of the Avatar of Fear for a Rogue alternate or to
sell. Beware however that these are shadowknights and they do use harm touch and
other shadowknight spells such as Lifetap. The Crusaders have a pet so another 
easy way to find them is use your spell, Sense the Dead.&nbsp; The Crusaders are level 33 and can be
soloed at around level 35. This is very risky but if there are no groups you can
join, this is a definite alternative. The crusaders spawn on the four corners of
the first level of the Archon Temple. Their placeholders are zealots. Make sure
that you are invisible until you are about to attack. Once you are ready and you
made sure no other mobs are around you, send in your pet. The crusader will use
his harmtouch on your pet. His harmtouch is the major attack so you don&#146;t want
it to be cast on you. Once your pet dies, which is most likely will, cast your
DoTs on the crusader and then start meleeing him, using your Lifetap. If the
crusader starts to run, then use Engulfing Darkness so that it does not get
away. If the crusader happens to get away, get out of there. Either use gate or
camp because if you don&#146;t then you will die. It will start a very huge train.
There is now a new source of getting Decaying Armor.&nbsp; The Crusader 
Ritualists do drop it.&nbsp; They level 29-32 and also spawn on a pyramid 
located in the maze.&nbsp; They don't have any placeholders and their spawn time 
ranges from 1-3 hours.&nbsp; Also, when you actually get to loot the Decaying Armor, there are Right and Left
pieces to the armor which make it even harder to do the quests.</p>
</font>
<p ALIGN="CENTER"><b><u><font face="Verdana">The Boots</font></u></b></p>
<font FACE="Verdana" SIZE="2">
<p>For the Boots you will need the Right and Left part of the Decaying Boots,
and two fairy dusts. The Fairy Dusts are dropped off of any type of fairies.
Yes, this means the level 10 ones in Greater Faydark. If you want to do this
quickly, then get a tracker to help you find the Fairies. Or you can just wait
on orc hill and fairies wander by there very often.</p>

</font>
<p ALIGN="CENTER">&nbsp;</p>
<p ALIGN="CENTER"><b><u><font face="Verdana">The Bracers</font></u></b></p>
<font FACE="Verdana" SIZE="2">
<p>For the Bracers you will need the Right and Left part of the Decaying
Bracers, and the Broken Minotaur&#146;s Lord Horn. This is dropped by the Minotaur
Lord in Steamfont Minotaur Caves. The Minotaur Lord is level 28-30 and hits for
around 35-60 hitpoints per attack. He is faster than Spirit of the Wolf so if
you want to try and kite it, you will have to use a spell that slows him down.
If you want to do this quest twice then you will have to repeat the quest once
you has finished it the first time. This is because the Decaying Bracers are
Lore so you can not have two of them.</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="../images/dfbracer.jpg" WIDTH="320" HEIGHT="131"></p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
</font>
<p ALIGN="CENTER"><b><u><font face="Verdana">The Breastplate</font></u></b></p>
<font FACE="Verdana" SIZE="2">
<p>For the Breastplate you will need Decaying Mail and Decaying Breastplate, and
two enchanted bars of platinum. Platinum Bars can be bought at any jewelry store
for around 110 platinum depending on your charisma. Then you must get both these
bars enchanted by an enchanter that is level 34 or higher.</p>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="../images/darkforgebreastplate.jpg" WIDTH="317" HEIGHT="133"></p>

</font>
<p ALIGN="CENTER"><b><u><font face="Verdana">The Gauntlets</font></u></b></p>
<font FACE="Verdana" SIZE="2">
<p>For the Gauntlets you will the Right and Left part of the Decaying Gauntlets,
and one enchanted bar of platinum. Platinum Bars can be bought at any jewelry
store for around 110 platinum depending on your charisma. Then you must get the
bar enchanted by an enchanter that is level 34 or higher.</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="../images/dfguantlets.jpg" WIDTH="318" HEIGHT="132"></p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
</font>
<p ALIGN="CENTER"><b><u><font face="Verdana">The Greaves</font></u></b></p>
<font FACE="Verdana" SIZE="2">
<p>For the Greaves you will need the Right and Left part of the Decaying
Greaves, and two melatite. The Melatite drops from CX Clockworks in SolA which 
are around level 30.&nbsp; The drop is semi-uncommon.</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="../images/dfgreaves.jpg" WIDTH="317" HEIGHT="127"></p>
</font>
<p ALIGN="CENTER"><b><u><font face="Verdana">The Helm</font></u></b></p>
<font FACE="Verdana" SIZE="2">
<p>For the Helm you will need a Decaying Visor and a Decaying Helm and 2
Freeport Militia Helms. The Freeport Militia Helms drop from Freeport Guards.
The best one to camp is Dreiken, who spawns in East Freeport close to the West
Freeport zone. This is also near the named beggar. He spawns every 10-15 minutes
and drops the Militia Helm about 80% of the time. This is also a good spot
because there are no other guards around and you don&#146;t have to run around the
zones killing guards hoping that you get a helm because most other guards have a
lower chance of dropping the Helm. Also, this will give you a huge faction hit,
but if you camp Dreiken the you will only take faction hit to the Freeport
Militia about twice so it won&#146;t completely ruin your faction.</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="../images/dfhelm.jpg" WIDTH="318" HEIGHT="130"></p>
</font>
<p ALIGN="CENTER"><b><u><font face="Verdana">The Vambraces</font></u></b></p>
<font FACE="Verdana" SIZE="2">
<p>For the Vambraces you will need the Right and Left Decaying Vambraces, and a
Qeynos Guard Kite Shield. The Qeynos Guard Kite Shield is what is asked, but it 
is really called the Qeynos Kite Shield.&nbsp; The Kite Shield drops from the 
two Guards at the Guard tower in North Karanas.&nbsp; There are two guards here.&nbsp; 
You can either have a druid harmony them, or just wait until one of the guards 
runs off after some monster, and then pull the other.&nbsp; The guards both 
conned blue to a 35.</p>
