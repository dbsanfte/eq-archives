<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">Vrynn says: (text needed)</p>
<p>For the leggings you will need one medium banded leggings, one powdered 
dufrenite, Permafrost Snowball, Bone Barbs. The Permafrost Snowball is found on 
Goblin Wizards in (guess where), Permafrost. The Wizards are level 23-25 and 
nuke hard. They are found most commonly in the flag room. You can get a group to 
camp it with you and if the flag room is too easy for you, just pull from a 
little bit deeper. Be warned that the Wizards can see invis. The Snowball is a 
very rare drop off of these and it can take 20-40 times to get it. The Bone 
Barbs are dropped commonly from a Bone Barbed Skeleton in either Unrest or Rathe 
Mountains. They are level 26-28 and have a permanent damage shield on 
themselves. They drop nice platinum for their level so they are usually camped 
even though there isn’t an actual spawn point, you just might have trouble 
finding one to kill. he banded leggings can be either bought off of players for 
around 10 platinum or they can be made with the blacksmithing skill.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">Kyralynn says: (text needed)</p>
<p>For the bracer you will need one medium banded bracer, one regular dufrenite, 
Cauldron Shell, Bull Elephant Tooth. The Cauldron Shell are dropped from Aqua 
Goblin Tidal Lords in Dagnor’s Cauldron. These are level 22-24. They swim to and 
from the island in the middle of the water. It would be very helpful if you 
found a tracker to help you find them. They are very easy to find once you have 
a tracker and they drop the Shell commonly. The Bull Tooth drops off of Bull 
Elephants in South Karanas which are level 20-24. They hit very hard for their 
level and are a semi-rare spawn. The Tooth drops about once every 6 times and 
they spawn close to the Shadowmen. The banded bracers can be either bought off 
of players for around 5 platinum or they can be made with the blacksmithing 
skill.</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">The Helm</p>
</u></font><font FACE="Verdana" SIZE="2">
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">You say: What totemic helm?</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">Kyralynn says: (text needed)</p>
<p>For the helm you will need a Glacier Bear Pelt, and Ogreskin Chamois, one 
medium banded helm, and one ground dufrenite. The Glacier Bear Pelt is dropped 
from a Glacier Bear in the underwater caves in Everfrost. These caves aren’t 
actually underwater but to get to them you must swim through the frozen river. 
If you are coming from Halas and you hit the river, find a hole in the ice and 
swim to the left. If you are like me and very cautious when underwater you may 
want to have enduring breath. Once in the cave, you basically just have to wait. 
The Glacier Bear is a rare spawn in the caves. Its placeholder is a skeleton 
that walks clockwise around the caves. You will want to get a map because there 
are some very high level NPCs that you will not want to run into such as Miragul. 
Once you have the Glacier Bear, killing it is another matter. You can solo it at 
level 34 with a pet but it is still pretty hard. You might want to have one 
friend come and help you with it. If you have two level 34s then there shouldn’t 
be any problem killing it. Loot the Glacier Bear Pelt from it. The Ogreskin 
Chamois is dropped from a Lizard Page within Cazic Thule Temple. The pages are 
level 20 and drop the Chamois rarely. They spawn most commonly in the maze area 
but are also pulled if you hunt in the Throne Room. Just get into a group and 
let the members know that you want the Chamois and you shouldn’t have any 
trouble. The banded helm can be either bought off of players for around 15 
platinum or they can be made with the blacksmithing skill.</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">The Mail</p>
</u></font><font FACE="Verdana" SIZE="2">
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">You say: What totemic mail?</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">Kyralynn says: (text needed)</p>
<p>For the mail (breastplate), you will need Lancer Swordfish Fin, Grizzlenot 
Bark, one crushed Dufrenite, and one medium banded mail. The Lancer Swordfish 
Fin drops from Lancer Swordfish within Kedge Keep. This is an all underwater 
dungeon so of course you will need Enduring Breath. You can either tag along on 
a raid and loot the Fin off of the Lancer’s that they kill or you can get a 
group together and kill some on your own. They are level 28-32 and the Fin is a 
random drop. You might get it on your first try or you might get it on your 40<sup>th</sup> 
try. The Grizzlenot Bark drops off of the named treant Grizzlenot. This is a 
very, very rare treant and only spawns once every 1-2 days. This part of the 
quest will be very tedious because you will have to wait a long while to get the 
Bark. Try and join a treant group. The nice thing about it is that treants are 
good exp from level 27-33 so you will get some experience while waiting if you 
get into the group. The medium banded mail can be either bought off of players 
for around 15 platinum or they can be made with the blacksmithing skill.</font></b><font SIZE="1">
