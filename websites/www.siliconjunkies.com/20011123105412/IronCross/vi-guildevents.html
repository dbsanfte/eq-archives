are alternates or primaries. This encompasses all in-game activities, from basic
experience camps, to epic encounters such as gods and dragons, and everything in
between.</font>

B. OBLIGATIONS TO ATTEND:</font>

                    </p>
                    <ol style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 10pt">
                      <li>Events scheduled and approved by High Council will
                        generally indicate the attendance requirement for
                        success in accomplishing the event's purpose. In
                        general, such scheduled events are mandatory to attend
                        and is on the basis of ensuring success more than
                        anything else.

                      </li>
                      <li>No member will be required to attend an event where
                        substantial loss in faction will be incurred, provided
                        no convenient means to repair such faction loss exists.
                        This applies only to factions of significance, usually
                        in regards to one's home town and areas they frequent.
                        For example, losing faction with bixies is not a reasonable
                        basis to not attend, where as, losing faction with home
                        town of Grobb would be.

                      </li>
                      <li>Scheduled events and spawns of opportunity take
                        precedent over errands, experience and item camps. For
                        example, being settled in an exp camp in Sebilis or
                        training up smithing skill is not an acceptable basis
                        for not attending.

                      </li>
                      <li>Time constraints is not an acceptable basis for not
                        attending scheduled events or spawns of opportunity. For
                        example, only having two hours of play time left is not
                        an acceptable basis for not attending. Those two hours
                        can be devoted to assisting everyone else getting off to
                        a good start.

                        <ol type="a" style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 10pt">
                          <li>For spawns of opportunity, if travel time would
                            exceed one's remaining play time then attendance is
                            not required. This, however, does not apply to
                            scheduled events as it was previously announced and traveling
                            to the location in question should have occurred
                            before the start time.

                        by the raid leader.
