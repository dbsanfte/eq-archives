                        directly affect and improve that alternate's primary
                        character. For example, a caster who plays their tank
                        alt, would not be allowed to compete for tank items, but
                        would be allowed to compete for caster items if that
                        person's primary character would actually use the item.

                        for the class not chosen will be subject to guild
                        distribution rules and the person in question will not

                    our guild charter is to place enjoyment of the game over all

                    in-game items. Enjoyment of the game revolves around
                    improvement of one's primary character and success in things
                    we all work together on. The sense of accomplishment and
                    trust we instill within each other with the things we do and
                    the way we interact will last much longer than the Everquest

                    that would damage the enjoyment of the game and fundamental
                    trust between people has to do with the misappropriation of
                    loot and the hard feelings that are associated with those occurrences.
                    The establishment of these rules is intended to prevent
                    mishandling of loot and clearly identify everyone's
                    eligibility to receive the same. It is a standing order that
                    all members within Iron Cross agree to abide by. It is a
                    responsibility we will all share in ensuring they are
                    enforced because we know it is in our best interest of
                    fairness to do so.</font></p>

                    considered a violation of trust and will not be tolerated or
                    allowed to go unanswered. The High Council will work with
                    anyone in resolving injustices or correcting mistakes,
                    however, in the event that a speedy resolution can not be
                    accomplished, we can and will /guildremove and/or /petition

                    those who participate in such activities are not welcomed
                    within our ranks, and is intended to protect and advocate
