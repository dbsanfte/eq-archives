    <h3>EverQuest Tailoring</h3>
    <b>An ending, of sorts...</b><br>
    <p>March 7, 2004 - I started playing EverQuest the day the game was released. I loved it, and my addiction lasted years. However, it's been months
    since I even thought about playing the game. I guess I'm done. I've closed my Everquest account, and I don't really expect to ever re-open it.
    Perhaps I'll come back for EQ2, perhaps not.</p>
    
    <p>Meanwhile, this domain was just renewed for another year, so I'll leave the tailoring guide, out-dated though it is, online at least that
    much longer. It won't be updated any more, naturally, but a surprising number of people still use it, so for them it remains.</p>

    <p>Thanks to everyone for all the encouragement, referrals, support and assistance over the years. I enjoyed being part of your world.</p>
