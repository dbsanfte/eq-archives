<hr><h3>Comments and Updates</h3>

<p>03/30 - Added Coldain Tanners Kit to Thurgadin merchants.</p>

<p>03/24 - Updated Erudin merchants.</p>

</p>If you have corrections or additions, please feel free to email me at
<a href="mailto:lokari@lokari.net">lokari@lokari.net</a>.</p>

<hr><h3>Pattern Sets</h3>

<p>There are different sets of patterns in Everquest. A merchant who sells patterns
will always sell all the items of one set, or the other, but generally not both. For
convenience, I'll refer to these as Sets A and B and C. Note that as I search the Kunark and
Velious continents, I'm finding some variations (hence the addition of Set C).</p>

<p><b>Set A</b> - This set includes the original armor items that could be tailored when the game was released.</p>
<p>Boots, Cap, Gorget, Glove, Pants, Sleeve, Tunic</p>

<p><b>Set B</b> - This set includes non-armor items, as well as armor items that were added after release.</p>
<p>Belt, Cloak, Gorget, Mask, Shoulderpad, Wristband<br>
   Backpack, Whip, Quiver, Fleeting Quiver</p>

<p><b>Set C</b> - This set includes <i>all</i> the armor items.</p>
<p>Belt, Boots, Cloak, Cap, Glove, Gorget, Mask, Pants, Shoulderpad, Sleeve, Tunic, Wristband</p>
