TAILORING
<p>A detailed guide to the creation of clothing.
<br>
<br>To become a Tailor, you will need a Sewing Kit. Sewing Kits can be bought at
most leatherworking shops.
<br>
<br>Once you have a Sewing Kit and the correct component pieces, you will need a
pattern for the garment you wish to make.
<br>
<br>Place the pattern and the raw material in your Sewing Kit. Start sewing.
<br>
<br>ON SIZING AND ARMOR
<br>
<br>Armor must be sized to your client. There are three sizes of armor:
Small, Medium & Large. Some races can wear more than one size of armor.

tailored from WOLF pelts.

<h3><a name="wu"></a>Master Wu's Tailoring Techniques</h3>

<p>The traditional garments of the disciples of Master Wu are sewn from the
appropriate pattern and Silk Swatches cured with a mixture of Four Heady Kiolas
and a Vial of Viscous Mana.</p>

<p>Caps, Masks, Collars, Mantles, and Wristbands require one silk swatch. A sash,
sleeves, or slippers require two silk swatches. Shirts, cloaks, and pantaloons
require three silk swatches.</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="wu_3"></a>Volume 3 of the Chronicles of Wu</h3>

<p>... the orcs struck without warning, and only by skill did I manage to escape.
With no hope of returning to our temple, I hide in this empty camp and devise new
methods of making stronger uniforms. Maybe one day our improved garb will save a
Brother's life.</p>

<p>The silk from the giant spiders has proved to be stronger and lighter than I had
dreamed. It requires but two silks to make a swatch, and one swatch is enough for any
part of a raw silk uniform but the tunic and leggings.</p>

<p>Thinking of a way to improve the silk, I recalled the words of Master Thos many
seasons ago. He waves a bottle of kiola in front of me and proclaimed, "This is both
drink...and weapon. Raw silk has many desirable properties, Apprentice Wu, but when
cured with kiola... there is no better battle uniform for a Brother of the Silent Fist..."
I wonder what other wisdom I would have learned if he had not fallen asleep.</p>

<p>Heeding his wisdom, I have tried mixing various amounts of kiola with silk during
the curing process and have found the results encouraging. The cured silk is much
stronger and lighter than the raw silk, unfortunately sometimes it takes more silk
to make cured armor than the raw armor.</p>

<p>Before the massacre by the orcs we had engaged in conversation with a traveling
Enchantress by the name of Minlapus. Observing our techniques of silk tailoring,
she offered to provide us with vials of thickened mana. By using a greater lightstone
and the enchanting fluid she claimed we could make gauntlets capable of smiting
creatures impervious to our bare hands. A side benefit is that the gauntlets would
emit light, a boon in this dim forest known as Lesser Faydark.</p>

<p>One note I should make is the method by which the nearby centurions make whips.
It appears that they carefully trap a wolf and use its pelt, curing it with kiola,
with a whip pattern. A simple process, but one I had not seen until now.</p>

<p>Dawn approaches, so I must put my quill down and cover my lightstone.
The orcs will be patrolling soon.</p>

<h3><a name="quivers"></a>Tailoring Quivers</h3>

Many archers prefer to craft their own quivers.

<p>The simplest of hand crafted quivers can be made in a tailoring kit with
a High Quality Cat Pelt and a Quiver Pattern.

<br>There have been archers who have developed more personal quivers usually
for the sake of style, but it is not my place to reveal their secrets.</p>

FLEETING QUIVER

<p>The fleeting quiver is an enchanted quiver that allows arrows to be drawn
very quickly.
<br>To craft a Fleeting Quiver you must obtain a Fleeting Quiver Pattern, Aviak
Egg Oil, a High Quality Lion Skin, a Vial of Distilled Mana, and Griffon
Feathers.</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="on_terrorantula_silk"></a>On Terrorantula Silk</h3>

<p>I recently had the fortune to purchase a strange silk from a traveler hailing
from the deserts of Ro. After expermenting for quite some time with the new material
I discovered that when sewn into swatches it could be cured with Purified Mana,
threaded with Platinum Thread, and using an appropriate pattern tailored into an
armor as strong as steel!! One swatch was sufficient to craft a helm, collar, mask,
pauldron, or bracer. Two swatches were needed for a waistband, vambraces, guantlets,
or boots. Three swatches were needed for a breastplate, cloak, or greaves.</p>

<p>
The Crafty Tailor<br>
by Meeka Diggs<br>
<br>
Every summer in the Vale we<br>
must face the insect season<br>
when the little buggers come<br>
in swarms to feast on our<br>
crops and march on our homes.<br>
This past summer my hubby<br>
returned home from a daily<br>
wander with a captured<br>
spiderling. I was at first<br>
appalled by the creature but<br>
my hubby placed it in a large<br>
wooden cage outside our home<br>
so that the insects could fly<br>
in and get caught in the webs<br>
and the spiderling could not<br>
get out.<br>
Each day the spider would<br>
tear down his web and discard<br>
the silk and soon I had a<br>
large amount of the material<br>
to dispose of.<br>
As I reached for my broom one<br>
day I stumbled and scraped my<br>
palms in the fall. I hurried<br>
to our cupboard for a bandage<br>
and to my dismay there were<br>
non in our home.<br>
That was when Bristlebane<br>
blessed me with a bit of his<br>
craftiness. Taking my trusty<br>
TAILORING KIT, I wove a spool<br>
of SILK THREAD from TWO bits<br>
of SPIDERLING SILK. Once I<br>
had TWO spools of SILK THREAD<br>
I wove a SILK BANDAGE and<br>
bound my injured palms.<br>
With so much silk at my <br>
disposal I quickly ran out of<br>
bags to store it in. Taking<br>
THREE spools of SILK THREAD, I<br>
wove a SILK CORD and then<br>
made myself a SMALL BAG from<br>
the SILK CORD and a LOW<br>
QUALITY WOLF SKIN.<br>
In order to prevent myself<br>
from falling and injuring<br>
myself on the hard floors I<br>
used my remaining LOW QUALITY<br>
SKINS of wolves, cats, and<br>
bears and one SILK THREAD to<br>
fashion some LEATHER PADDING<br>
which I laid on the floors. I<br>
have since had a blacksmith<br>
friend of mine offer to<br>
purchase such padding for use<br>
in his crafting of platemail<br>
armors.</p>
