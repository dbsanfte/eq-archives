<hr><h3>Comments and Updates</h3>

<p>06/29 - Got rid of the whole "Sets" concept, and just listed actual patterns sold for each merchant.</p>

<p>06/29 - Added and corrected Qeynos and West Karana information.</p>

<p>06/27 - Updated Firiona Via information, and added more Loom locations.</p>

</p>If you have corrections or additions, please feel free to email me at
<a href="mailto:lokari@lokari.net">lokari@lokari.net</a>.</p>


<hr><h3>Deluxe Sewing Kits</h3>

<p>Deluxe sewing kits are not available for purchase at any merchant. These ten slot kits came into
existence with a series of patches in May 2001 - at one point, all large sewing kits were changed from
having eight slots to having ten. This meant that if you already owned a large sewing kit, it became a
ten slot kit automatically. Large sewing kits purchased during this time also had ten slots. However,
in a later patch the large sewing kits were changed back to the eight slot variety. Any existing ten
slot large sewing kit that characters owned were renamed to Deluxe Sewing Kits, and stayed in the ten
slot configuration. If you are fortunate enough to have one of the Deluxe sewing kits, I recommend that
you hang on to it.</p>


<hr><h3>Loom Locations</h3>

<p>There are Looms scattered throughout Norrath. These are essentially stationary Deluxe Sewing Kits. If
you want to make a recipe that has more than eight ingredients, but you don't have a Deluxe Sewing Kit,
then the Loom is the tool you'll use. To use the Loom, just click on its top bar, and it will open.</p>

<p>Here is a partial list of cities and locations where the looms can be found. I'll add to this list
as I stumble across more looms.<br><br>

<li>Erudin - At location -870, -60
<li>Felwithe (South) - Felwithe in the first building after the zone
<li>Firiona Vie - Near the tailor supply merchants, location -3640, 2040
<li>Freeport (East) - Freeport in the "Imported Goods" shop, on the 2nd Floor
<li>Halas - Next to Mac's Kilts
<li>Kaladim (South) - In a small room near the arena area
<li>Kelethin - Like everything else in this town, you just have to stumble around until you find it
<li>Oggok - First room in the third tunnel, on the way to the Shaman guild, location 700, 700
<li>Paineel - In "Sinfully Handsome"
<li>Qeynos (South) - Near "Lions Man Inn" at 150, -50
<li>Rivervale - In central area near the brew barrel, location 0, -245
