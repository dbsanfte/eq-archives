<P>&#9;Tunare punishes arrogance. </P><br><P>At least my father always told me so. Perhaps it was my jaunty remark at Gnasher’s table that had done it—or perhaps I simply left Tunare’s blessings back in Qeynos Hills, but Everfrost was not kind to me. It was stark and beautiful…but not kind.</P><br><P>&#9;My first attempt at hunting one of the exotic white bears of the plains almost cost me my life. The hide and fur of these bears was tougher than anything I had ever encountered. My first arrow, instead of crippling the beast, only enraged it, and it came barreling at me over the frozen ground. My second arrow stuck in its hide unnoticed. There was not time for a third arrow.</P><br><P>&#9;I valiantly reached for my sword, only to find it stuck solidly in the scabbard—frozen there from the cold.</P><br><P>&#9;Fortunately, polar bears do not climb trees.</P><br><P>&#9;The result was a bit humiliating. The bear refused to leave. He growled and roared for most of the day, beneath me. Until a cadre’ of Barbarian warriors happened by, attracted by the sound of the animal’s cries.</P><br><P>&#9;They spoke to each other in their native tongue for bit, examinaing the situation, and laughing vigorously. Finally their leader stepped forward a bit, "Ho there, Halfling!" he called, "What are ye seekin’ up there?"</P><br><P>&#9;They apparently found this pretty amusing. "Nothing, really. Just relaxing, and having a smoke."</P><br><P>&#9;Again they conferred and laughed, "Very well, then! We’ll be on our way! Good huntin’, to ya, Halfling!"</P><br><P>&#9;"Alright, Alright!" I cleared my throat. "I am not from here. Can you tell me how to kill this bear?"</P><br><P>&#9;"Hmm…have ya been shooting him with arrows?"</P><br><P>&#9;"Yes."</P><br><P>&#9;"Well, don’ do that, it does na work!"</P><br><P>&#9;"Yes, I discovered that!"</P><br><P>&#9;"Well, have ya skewered ‘m on yer sword?"</P><br><P>&#9;"No."</P><br><P>&#9;"Why not?"</P><br><P>&#9;"Because it’s frozen into the scabbard! And..uh…well…it’s a REALY big bear!" </P><br><P>&#9;As the leader turned to translate my words, several of the hunting party actually fell the ground and rolled in the snow in mirth. For the better part of a half hour, each one of them in turn would speak in Barbarian and all the others would roll on the ground laughing.</P><br><P>&#9;The bear was the only one not laughing. It looked very serious.</P><br><P>&#9;At last the leader of the warriors wiped the tears from his eyes and spoke again in common, "Alright, Halfling! We’ll help ya out. But in the the future ya ought na hunt up here. G’back ta the hills and the vales. This is hard land up here."</P><br><P>&#9;With this, the warriors abruptly produced, seemingly from nowhere, a forest of heavy swords, axes and spears and simply hacked the bear to death. </P><br><P>&#9;Then they strolled off into the tundra laughing to themselves in Barbarian.</P><br><P>&#9;I sat up in the tree for some time and rolled myself a cigarette with the last of the tobbacco that I had bought in Qeynos.</P><br><P>&#9;So that is how you do it. You just hack it apart. Just like that…</P><br><P>&#9;These Barbarians were the toughest men I had ever seen. Was I a little out of my depth here? Surefall and Qeynos Hills were so tame compared to Everfrost. I started to wonder if I could make it here or not.</P><br><P>&#9;Things didn’t get much better form there.</P><br><P>&#9;Just outside Halas, I used the last of my copper to buy some blade oil—in hopes that I would not suffer the frozen sword problem again. </P><br><P>&#9;Adjusting my expectations, I discovered quickly that I could kill the white wolves of Everfrost…and the very small polar bear cubs. Unfortunately, barbarians are huge people and the small pelts of the wolves brought me next to nothing from the merchants of Halas. Even when I was able to bring down a polar bear cub, the disdain of the Barbarians was evident in the prices that they gave me on my skins.</P><br><P>Everfrost was a hard land, as the warrior had told me that day. My bow was no longer sufficient to bring down game and I would frequently have to engage it in melee. </P><br><P>My meager savings was dwindling.</P><br><P>I was out of arrow points and blade oil. But worse still, my boots were wearing thin. Everfrost’s bitter cold I could not last without good boots.</P><br><P>I needed money.</P><br><P>To this point I had not dallied too long in the town of Halas. The stares and hushed voices of the tall, fur-clad barbarians were warning enough. I was not welcome here. However, Halas now had something I needed. </P><br><P>It had a public forge.</P><br><P>Located just outside the armorer’s shop, the elders of the Six Hammers had erected a forge for any and all who wished to use it. Presumably this was to encourage the skill of smithing among the citizens of Halas. A town can never have too many smiths.</P><br><P>As it happened, Halas had very few.</P><br><P>I had not fully stoked the forge before a young barbarian walked up. His face was painted in blue war paint. He was obviously a warrior. He looked quizically at me and then at the forge. I stared back at him for a moment and continued firing the forge.</P><br><P>"Ya a smithy, Halfling?" he asked.</P><br><P>I scowled a bit. "Acutally, I’m a human. Halflings are a bit shorter than me, even."</P><br><P>"But ya are a smithy?"</P><br><P>"Yes."</P>         <br>
