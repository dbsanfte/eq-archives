	Erudin is on a continent called Odus to the west of Antonica, specifically Qeynos . A boat comes along every hour or so, and can be boarded by anyone for free, provided they can pass the guards. Few people board the boats save Erudites themselves, for Odus has many dangers, physical and mystical. The ways of its people seem strange and foreign to almost all the races on and in Norrath. However, few notice Odus has many wonders. The grand marble city of Erudin stands as its crowning achievement. Its inhabitants, the Erudites, have created  a society based almost entirely on magic, and this truly is more interesting than the most beautiful city..................<br><br>	The storms raged down upon the deck of the Golden Maiden, her sails torn by the fury of the rain. Even from the warmth of the lower cabin, the rain pounded against the ship, like a creature pounding to get in. The winds swayed carrying the rain, and almost pushing to shore, rocked the boat in its fury.The waves crashed about, in uneven patterns, and death seemed immenent. Enhasa had once regailed to me a tale from a long forgotton tome, telling of the war between Prexus the oceanlord against Xeogeny the air god. It seemed more and more true as we sailed toward our apparent death.<br><br>	We were saved, however, as we reached the city of magic. The waves crashed agianst the boat like a child playing with a toy, and we had no course, it seemed the city would become our destination after all, and almost certainly our last. Fortunatly, the Erudites, however their manner, would not let someone die without reason. It seemed as if the whole of Erudin was at the docks that day, creating a barrier around our ship and bringing it to shore.<br><br>	The Erudites turned away after our safety was assured, and did not adknowledge our thanks. The sailors scoffed and made rude comments, shuffling away to repair their ship. But I understood that it was their way, and nothing could be done about it.  One lone Erudite stayed behind, his name was Enhasa, and he was why I had come to Erudin in the first place.<br><br>"Hail, friend Rycar.  I would ask you about your trip, but it appears I already know the ending hmm?"<br><br>"I suppose. So Enhasa, you wouldn't happen to have a drink for the weary Paladin, would you?"<br><br>	He wouldn't, and I knew it. He strayed from the physical, his life was in magic, which he sought to bring to every thing, by being an enchanter, and quite a good one at that. As a Paladin, I too had a few spells, but only to supplement my fighting ability.<br>But this is not my story.<br><br>	He made some sort of rude comment about Half Elves, and we went to the inn, where I would be staying. Tulluian asked if he could come with me to Erudin, but wasn't terribly disappointed when I said no. I think he asked more out of courtesy than of wanting, and I really can't blame him. <br><br>"If knowledge is the greatest quest, Paladin, than what is the point of yours? Why don't you open a bookstore." he once remarked.<br><br>	But here, standing in front of their great marble library, I couldn't believe he missed this. Enhasa shooed me along to the inn, as the patrons of the Library generally do not like a Half Elf in full plate walking in with a huge sword.<br><br>	We found my room, the burly human innkeep eyeing Enhasa with unease. I regailed to him my tales of adventure, of the tiny land of Rivervale to the towering trees of Kelethin. It seemed to amuse him little, as his thoughts were of the mind. "Child of Magic, Student of Dream" as a foolish bard would once describe him.<br><br>         <br>
