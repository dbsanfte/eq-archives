<P>Khel looked down at me from above the head of the bed. It was odd looking up and watching him speak upside down. "She came with them cuz they were looking ta find ya."</P><br><P>"I figured I could use the help." she said, "To find the rogue ranger who lived with the gnolls, hidden away in Qeynos Hills--not an easy task."</P><br><P>I struggled to rise to my elbow, "Why does everyone think I live with the gnolls? I do <B>not</B> live with the gnolls. I have <B>never</B> lived with the gnolls! I had my own camp and it was <B>one</B> gnoll! Just one, and we never lived together…we drank together and he took all my money at dice! That is the extent of it." I looked at Aethani closely. "You have come far to find me…why?"</P><br><P>"Well, I never did get to meet my brother-in-law." She smiled kindly, but I could see the pain behind her eyes—Layla’s pain. "And I was sent also…by one who would meet with you. He asked my guildmaster that I come here from Faydwer to find you."</P><br><P>"Who is it that wants to meet with me? And why?" </P><br><P>"Why I, do not know. But his name is Rezek of Felwithe. He is close with the Highcouncil of Feydwer somehow."</P><br><P>None of these names meant anything to me. Just names of strange governments of far-off lands. They probably wanted payment for the life Kartum. That seemed so long ago.</P><br><P>"Food!" said Gnasher, "Come eat now!"</P><br><P>The place had been cleaned up respectably and there was still enough stoneware left to eat off of—so Gnasher’s property was not the shambles I feared it would be.</P><br><P>Gnasher, despite his recent ordeal, was as hyper as a puppy. He seemed delighted to have the novelty of guests at his table and doted on the three of us like a mother.</P><br><P>A hermit? I had thought so before, but seeing him serving his thick stew and watching the energy with which he bounded to and from the table to make sure that Kheldan and Aethani, had anything they needed, was comical--and revealing. Gnasher was no hermit—he was, like me, an outcast. He was lonely.</P><br><P>There was an uncomfortable pause before the meal, as Gnasher slopped the stew into the clay bowls before us. Kheldan and Aethani looked at each other worriedly, and glanced sidelong at Gnasher, and then back at me.</P><br><P>I could tell what they were wondering. Gnasher was a gnoll; a brute, a cannibal—an enemy of man. </P><br><P>For me this was old hat, but it was new to them. "Gnasher, is this rabbit? Or is this still the venison we cleaned last winter?"</P><br><P>"Bah! Iz Rrabbit! Neverr keep vennizon zo long! It goez bad afterr the firzzt thaw!"</P><br><P>I nodded to Kheldan and Aethani meaningfully, and took a large bite of stew.</P><br><P>"If you findz any ringz or otherr jewelrry at the bottom, pleaze to tell me." Gnasher added.</P><br><P>Kheldan and Aethani both froze, with their spoons almost to their mouths.</P><br><P>Gnasher, burst out laughing, his snarl-toothed maw open wide. I was laughing too.</P><br><P>"Jokez, jokez! Izz rrabbit!"</P><br><P>Kheldan and Aethani didn’t appreciate that humor too much.</P><br><P>We talked a long time that night. The group broke up into two conversations. Khel and Aeth and Gnasher and myself. I do not think that the two of them were entirely at ease with Gnasher, and Kheldan was absolutely enthralled with Aethani’s stories of her travels. </P><br><P>Gnasher retired to his bed while Kheldan and Aethani continued their conversation softly at the kitchen table.</P><br><P>I hobbled out to the woodpile with a lantern and left them to their own. The night was moonless, and the cool darkness enveloped me as I stepped out the door. The bodies of the bounty hunters were behind the cabin—under a tarp. We would bury them at first light, but healing and recovering from the battle had taken precedence. </P><br><P>Back to business now, though. Perhaps one of the corpses had a clue to who had hired them. I pulled back the tarp, and gazed evenly at the face of the one I had stabbed. The tan of his skin that I remembered from the fight had taken the gray pallor of death—pale and claylike.</P><br><P>In the back of my mind, I was a bit surprised. I was not the most veteran of warriors and I thought the sight of death would put me off. However, it did not. It was not a man, I was looking at now, it was merely an object. Whatever man there was was gone from it now. Now it was just an empty hulk. Like the shell of a nut that one discards—the important bit is in the center. The shell is just a piece of waste to be discarded.</P><br><P>There was dried blood down the front of his face from where I had hit him with the haft of the axe, and the pommel of his knife still protruded from beneath his chin.</P><br><P>But the wounds were not what I wanted to see. I wanted to see where there were no wounds—and why. </P><br><P>Pulling my knife from my belt, I slit his tunic open down the front. Beneath it, the silvery glimmer of an armored coat danced orange under the light of my lantern. Banded mail...of dwarvish make, most likely. Very nice—tough enough to stop the full swing of my axe, and tough enough to stop my black arrow. </P><br><P>A banded coat! A smith of great skill must have made it, and it must have cost a fortune.</P><br><P>I made a mental note to myself. Armor—if I was to fight the creature I must have armor.</P><br><P>His pockets and belt pouches contained a few silver coins.</P><br><P>Hmmmph. Must have spent all his money on the armor.</P><br><P>The coins were stamped with an odd face, and the tongue of the writing embossed on them was unfamiliar. Minted in Felwithe most likely. </P><br><P>I paused, before dropping them in my pouch.</P><br><P>Was I looting the dead?</P>         <br>
