<P>&#9;Light….</P><br><P>&#9;Waking up from the sleep of death was not what I had been prepared for when I had let the earth take me. When I sagged to the ground, I had seen Layla, and I fancied that, for a moment, I felt the soft, warm touch of her hand on my face. We were together again.</P><br><P>&#9;Though in that moment, I felt great anger, and tried to rouse myself. The creature would go unpunished—I must rise! </P><br><P>&#9;But the darkness was so soft, so comforting. How peaceful to just sleep.</P><br><P>&#9;Just for a little while…</P><br><P>&#9;Not long…</P><br><P>&#9;…and I dreamed….</P><br><P>&#9;Of all the mansions in Norrath, none could rival this. The walls of the great hall towered fifty feet from the floor. The rich sheen of their paneling reached all the way to the ceiling…to a filigree of silver that danced about the top if the room. </P><br><P>&#9;The floor was polished gray and white marble; at least, so seemed. As I looked into it, it appeared as though, just beneath its surface ethereal faces and hands; ghostly half-images of agony begging for release, scrabbled hopelessly at the stone from beneath.</P><br><P>&#9;Before me was a device I had only read about, in books; a magnificent instrument, much like the pianos of the symphonies, but larger; and made not of polished wood, but of a deep, black stonelike material, shot through swirls of crimson.</P><br><P>It was glassy smooth, and throbbed warm to the touch. And though it could not be, I knew that it was made of blood. </P><br><P>There was no revulsion at touching it. Its warmth was delicious.</P><br><P>Polished pipes of gold and silver, and of platinum, embossed with delicate, incomprehensible patterns, rose behind it in a forest of precious metal. </P><br><P>Somehow I could remember its music… and I knew somehow that that I could play it. It felt familiar to me…</P><br><P>But before I could sit before the keys and hear its majestic music, I felt the voice, more than heard it--like cold claws scratching at my mind.</P><br><B><I><P>Your work is not done!</P><br></B></I><P>&#9;</P><br><P>It was the pain that awoke me. The stabbing soreness in my leg brought with it the infuriating scratchy feeling of course blankets against my skin—and terrible thirst.</P><br><P>The dream vanished as my blurred sight resolved, and the image of the woman seated beside me on the bed cleared.</P><br><P>Layla.</P><br><P>My mouth tried uselessly to speak…and the pain redoubled as I tried weakly to rise, to take her in my arms, and crush her to me. My heart soared and a great weight was lifted from my chest…</P><br><P>Her hands gently pushed me down again. And she looked into my eyes with concern.</P><br><P>Something was wrong….</P><br><P>Something was different…</P><br><P>When she spoke, I knew that it was not her. </P><br><P>I lay back again and cursed my lying eyes. </P><br><P>"Kheldan, he is coming around…"</P><br><P>It was not her voice, but her likeness…so similar…</P><br><P>I could hear movement, and smell the warm aroma of some thick stew—even over the stink of the bed--Gnasher’s bed. It was all coming back to me now…</P><br><P>I heard Kheldan’s voice in the distance. "Can ‘e move that leg?"</P><br><P>"He can move it. He iz tough pup…and he izz had the pawz of grreat healerrz on him!"</P><br><P>I kept my eyes closed, trying to recall the events of the battle and pressed my fingers gently against my leg, probing through the thick bandages at the dull throbbing pain. "What…what happened?"</P><br><P>The woman’s voice answered me. "You have lost much blood, and the wounds in your leg are still deep."</P><br><P>Khel joined in, "It’ll be a few days afore ya should be walkin’ on it. It was almost hangin’ off ya, like a hunk o meat."</P><br><P>I opened my eyes, steeling myself for the stab of cold pain in my heart that I knew would come at looking on her face. She was taller than Layla, and darker of hair. Her eyes, though, and her face—and the way she held her head—all the same. It brought back lost memories. "Who are you?" I asked her.</P><br><P>Gnasher’s voice called from over at the stove, where he must have been cooking whatever it was that was that I had smelled. "She izz a <B><I>grreat healerr</B></I>!"</P><br><P>The woman smiled an amused half smile and looked sidelong in Gnasher’s direction. "I am Aethani." She said simply. "Layla spoke well of you."</P><br><P>Ah…of course. Layla’s sister. She was a druid as well, but had traveled to Kelethin to live and study the circles of Tunare with the elves there.</P><br><P>My brow furrowed, "What were you doing with those…bounty hunters?"</P>         <br>
