</B><P>It was at the harvest festival, in the Glade that spring, that I met my wife.</P><br><P>Tables had been set out in the Glade and the kegs sunk in the lake to cool. The ovens had smoked all night for a week before and the tables were heavy with meat and fish and bread. There were wines from Qeynos and grapes, imported all the way from Karana.</P><br><P>Bards and merchants had come from the city to sing and sell their wares.</P><br><P>The whole glade was alive with celebration, and free of care. Kartum was not present. In the eighteen months since our fight with the gnolls, he had become an incorragble drunk, only showing his face in the Glade when he needed a party to hunt with---so that he might get pelts to sell for more liquor.</P><br><P>I was standing with Cheskin, taking a moment of indulgance with a cup of mead. He was knelt down on one knee, playing at magic tricks with his little daughter.</P><br><P>"Esh, you really should spend more time in the Glade. You are hunting all the time. Or come with me and Tuvar to Qeynos for a few days."</P><br><P>"Why would I want to do that, Ches?"</P><br><P>"Because it’s social, ya big fool! Because it’s fun! My wife can watch the babes for a few days, as long as I care for the house before I go. We can see the sights! I hear there is a place in Qeynos that sells gnoll beer. You seem to have a fascination with the brutes. Wouldn’t you like to try their beer?"</P><br><P>"I don’t like beer, Ches. Besides, isn’t gnoll beer against the law?"</P><br><P>"Bah," he said, "The laws of Antonius Bayle. What harm is there in a little gnoll beer? I have heard it’s quite good."</P><br><P>"I don’t like beer, Ches."</P><br><P>"But it’s <B><I>gnoll</B></I> beer, Esh. It’s an oddity. It’s an experience."</P><br><P>"Hmm. But if I don’t like beer, wouldn’t it be a <B><I>bad</B></I> experience?"</P><br><P>Cheskin shook his head, "You are impossible. What about the girls, then? There are dancing shows…and I hear the ladies are like wild animals. A new quarry for your hunting, eh?"</P><br><P>I laughed, "You would have me chasing dancing girls in Qeynos? You have me mistaken for Kartum. The girl for me won’t be found…in…a….tavern…"</P><br><P>"Where, then Eshkin of the black arrow? You spend far too much time in the company of men. What girl could take your mind off the hunt? Esh? Esh?"</P><br><P>I could barely hear him. Amid a group of people gathered around a young bard, was a young woman. Her dress was simple brown cotton and there were flowers in her auburn hair. She wore no shoes on her feet and about her waist was a simple belt hung with medicine pouches. She was a Druid, surely, but none I had seen in the Glade. I would have remembered.</P><br><P>She was swaying back and forth to the ballad of the bard and clapping her hands softly. The smile on her face was luminous and her eyes shone with mirth.</P><br><P>"Uhh….hello." I was instantly embarassed. Was that the best I could do? Faced with the vision of her before me, I suppose I should be happy that I could speak at all.</P><br><P>She turned and looked at me, and her smile broadened, "Hail"</P><br><I><P>Ok Eshkin, what now? </P><br></I><P>"Are you from here?" I asked. ‘I was only wondering because I have lived here a long time and I don’t remember ever seeing you here. You look to be a druid, but I thought I knew all the Druids of the Glade…umm…"</P><br><P>She laughed and took my hand. The touch of her soft fingers sent a warm shiver through my entire body. "Dance with me," she said.</P><br><P>We danced. I barely remember it, and for that I am grateful, because I have always been a terrible dancer. </P><br><P>That was it for me. It was instant and undeniable. For the rest of the festival we were never apart. After I composed myself, I was able to speak again and we talked long into the night. Her name was Layla and she was a Druid of Surefall, an initiate, sent from Qeynos by her family. Once again I hadn’t been paying attention—I should have noticed her the moment she arrived.</P><br><P>I got little hunting done that summer, and Cheskin complained that he saw even less of me. However, I didn’t care. I had Layla. She could tell a tale like a bard and the music of her laughter was beter than the finest lute….</P><br><P>I will stop this here and move on….I do not feel that I can write more on her just now…</P><br><P>We were married in the Glade, by the fall and Cheskin was my best man. At the druid guild tree, the druids placed wreaths of flowers on our heads and declared their blessings. I have never had a happier moment.</P><br><P>Druids and Rangers are people of the land, but when the land is harsh, everyone loves a house.</P><br><P>I decided that, in short order, I would build Layla a house.</P><br><P>The title to the smithy was still safely stowed in Qeynos Hold and it did not take long for me to secure a buyer for the place. A fully outfitted smithy is an expensive affair, and buyers would be rare. However, my terms were simple and eagerly accepted. I sealed the deal, with Cheskin at my side, over a Blackburow Stout, in Fish’s Tavern by the docks in Qeynos. Ches was delighted that I had finally tried his gnoll beer. He was right. It was good.</P><br><P>The merchant would not take delivery of the smithy or open busines there until I sent word that the house was completed. Additionally, he would help me find woodcutters and craftsmen to help me build it. It would be built in total secrecy, as a surprise for her.</P><br><P>Cheskin was my accomplice in this, claiming to Layla and the rangers of the glade that I had accompanied him on his hunting—to cover my absence from the hunt. </P><br><P>Because Layla was a Druid, I decided that the house would be very close to the Glade, perched atop the steep rocky ridge down from the waterfall. From inside Surefall Glade, it was invisible, the crest of its roof just hidden by the towering rock walls that protectet the home of the Jaggedpine Treefolk. It could be accessed by a narrow path around the back side of the mountain. It would be built of treated logs, and I made sure that all the joints were well chinked with daub. The crowning finish of the place was a window of polished glass panes, imported from Erudin. This was so that we could sit and look out over the Glade in the winter. There were two fireplaces for warmth and a clay cistern on the roof to catch rainwater and snowmelt. </P><br><P>It was magnificent. All false modesty aside, I had outdone myself.</P><br><P>Cheskin helped me with the work when he could, as did the craftsmen sent by the merchant. </P><br><P>Had I taken time to stop and reflect, I should have considered myself fortunate to have the hidden wealth to bring such a project to life.</P><br><P>All through the months of building the house, Layla was distraught at my long abscences. She complained that she wanted to see me more and missed our long talks. In response I told her that I was hunting hard and saving my pelts to sell—so that I might surpirse her with something. Despite her questions I kept my secret safe, and before autumn, the house was complete.</P><br><P>I stood in the main room and lit my pipe (tobbacco was a habit that the decadent Cheskin had addicted me to). Watching how the late autumn daylight played over edges the amazing glass window. How the High Men must treasure the secret of changing sand into glass.</P><br><P>The door opened, at last and Cheskin and his wife Maurita carefuly escorted Layla into the room. She was blindfolded, but smiling. "You two had best not keep me much longer in suspense. My master is teaching me to summon a stinging swarm of pests to put you in your place…"</P><br><P>"No more suspense, my darling," I said, removing the blindfold from her eyes. That look of wonder on her face is the most beautiful thing I have ever seen…before…or since.</P><br><P>We made love that night in our new home. Perfect, passionate…love without doubt. Life was going to be perfect…</P><br><P>Layla and I had lived in the house for almost four months. As soon as the secret was out, we were the subject of much gossip in the Glade. Questions as to where I had gotten the money for such an endeavor were quickly laid to rest by Cheskin, whose wagging tongue could rival any bard. Everyone paid a visit…espically to see the wonderful Erudite glass window. Well…almost everyone. Kartum never came.</P><br><P>The black arrow that Hager Sureshot had given me that day had treated me well. While most other arrows splintered and shatterd in the prey, the black arrow never did. Part of its enchantment, I suppose. With it, I had dropped grizzly bears in their tracks in a single shot. Throughout its service it had not so much as scratched or tarnished. Its shaft was still straight and true and its path never erred.</P><br><P>At the bottom of the hill I shook hands with my hunting party and bid them good evening, looking forward to a quiet night by the fire with Layla curled up against me in our favorite chair, reading to me from one of her many books. I was always literate, but only just so. Layla had made it her personal task to make me, not only the top gamesman in the Glade, but also the most alacrit.</P><br><P>The path to the house was slick with snow that day, but the warming weather was sure to melt it away. I was thinking as I rounded the corner of the house that I should save some more money and build a wooden walkway in its place.</P><br><P>My smile broadened as I stepped up onto the threshhold and opened the door.</P><br><P>"Layla darling, I’m…back…."</P>         <br>
