          Alright, I promised a guild event and here it is: <br>
          The good people of Qeynos have long enjoyed a prosperous trade route with the Barbarians to the north. Recently Caravans have not reached the tunnels which pass form the rugged peaks of everfrost into the rolling hills of Qeynos. At first the mayor thought the Clan of Gnolls from Blackburrow had resurfaced as a threat but reports from trackers say the stench and footprints of Goblins littered the country side. Qeynos has been free of goblins for yeas but Halas has reported some minor sightings around the home of Lady Vox known as Permafrost. The mayor turned to the guilds for volunteers and The master of the SIlent fist stepped forward and announced that a force of men was un-needed. A brother from the SIlent fist clan will be more suited to slip into the stronghold and get any information that might support the facts found so far. A recent induction into the higher rings has borught forth the perfect canidate, Daeeb Jesterfists, also a member of the Knights of the Aurora, protecters of Norrath. Daeeb was dispatched immediately. That was 10 days ago. With no word from his pupil, the MAster gets worried that he may have sent the young monk to his death. Word has spread and finally reaches the halls which the Knights use to train. A meeting is called at once. The High SHaman Para stands and address`s the many knights who sit before her. After many long hours of planning it is decided, the Knights of tthe Aurora will organize a small force and venture deep within the bowels of Permafrost in search of their comrade, dead or alive they will find Daeeb! <br>
          <br>
          OOC: Ok this is a raid on perma with a purpose. Not only will we go in en masse and secure the place but we will also be looking for me :) A rescue mission mind u. FInd me if you can :) Anyhow here is what i see needs to happen, The entrance to perma is guarded by 4 Ice Giants, which will be controlled by a small group of our higher lvls. THey will just keep them killed and get nice exp and also the amzing amounts of money which can be used by the guild to fund events. These should be lvls 35+, I recommend 35-45. The rest of the party ranging from 20-35 will enter the dungeon and begin the insertion...room by room. I could be anywhere (minus lady voxs room, I wont go past teh kings room I promise :) The more we have the easier it will be. If you are younger then 20th then you can still come and hold the entrance area and maybe first room..but it will be tuff i assure you. If you have a friend bringem! TH emore the merrier and this way we can focus on some of the better spawns also. Before we can leave 3 things must occur: 1. I must be found 2. The goblin king must die at least once and his loot (Vox bracer) must be brought out and the we must leave all alive! So there you have it...ournext event is set. The date will be 28 july at 7pm PT. It is a friday night so we have the best chance for people to show and stay for a while. If this date time is too soon or not great let me know when is best and I will try and make it happen. Lets have some fun knights...i need emails from all who plan on being there, Include name, lvl and class so we can get the groups set up prior...I will assign groups and post them the day before the event. If you are bringin a friend I need their info also. I will attempt to have 1 or 2 high lvl clerics/characters to act as chaporons etc for the more difficult portions of the dungeon. After I am found I will help with this also if we want to stay for a longer period of time. Exp is great in this place and loot for all. I will hand out prizes for a few different things...and of course there will be lots of beer! So lets party and have fun people...and kill them gobbies!<br>
