    Our
    main goal is to improve the quality of the game for all our members by
    providing an in-game community much similar to a large family, if you are
    having more fun and enjoying Everquest as a guild member then that means we
    are meeting our main goal and thus making the game much more fun than it is,
    we do not like to burden our members with too many rules as the whole point
    to playing a game is to have fun and HAVING to do this or that can get
    annoying fast.&nbsp; We all have a good reputation for helping others,
    though not an obligation, most of our members will gladly give their lives
    to save each other and even help out strangers in need, if you are someone
    who thinks twice about risking their precious XP for another guild member
    then this guild is definitely not for you.&nbsp; We also help each other
    obtain valuable gear and very much dislike people who will lie and take gear
    from the guild only to sell it or use it for their own ends. Another of our
    goals though it has proven to be very difficult is to promote role-playing
    in the game, we don't role-play when talking to each other to facilitate
    communication but we all try to be a little bit more in character when
    talking to people outside of the guild.&nbsp; In closing if you want a large
    group of friends to share and enjoy Everquest much more and you are someone
    who shares our goals then please feel free to let us know in game that you
    want to join us, and to everyone who is already a member, thank you for
    making the guild such a good community!.</font></p>

      Leader has the ability to add and remove members from the guild as well as
      declare wars vs. another guild (which we don't do) or disband the guild.
      The Guild Leader has all the responsibilities of the Officers plus having
      to keep track of everything that goes on in the guild and deal with it appropriately,
      if any member has a personal issue with any other member he/she should
      first talk to the Guild Leader to find a solution, pretty much anything
      guild related is a responsibility for the Leader.</font></p>

      have the ability to add members to the guild, the guild is a democracy and
      for all guild decisions all of us have to agree for it pass, deciding if
      an applicant joins the guild, changing rules or policies, serving as
      referees when two or members have a problem, organizing events and keeping
      up with what is going on in the guild are tasks of the officers.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2" color="#B4B4B4">&nbsp; The Officers
      and Leader talk a lot as you can see in our message board, any member who
      is cooperative, gets along with everyone and acts when it is needed, and
      most important of all that we know quite well, will very likely be asked
      to help out the guild by taking on the responsibilities of an officer,
      this is how Fizzlefrazzle, Filiztyn and Neonod became
      officers.&nbsp; Nobody should expect to become an officer simply because
      of their experience level or time as a member in the guild, most important
      of all you don't ask to become an Officer but rather we will ask you to
      become one.</font></p>

          particular Ethnic/religious group (i.e. you can't get along with them)

          or can't do, everyone uses bad words, it is just a matter of knowing
          when to not use them.&nbsp; As there are members who will get offended
          by them do not use bad language in guild chat, an occasional one in
          extreme situations is understandable (i.e. You just died twice in a
          row) but a constant use of them even when asked by any other member to

          We do not hide who we are as it hampers the process of getting to know
          each and every single member in the guild.&nbsp; You must do your best
          to NOT use Anonymous modes in-game as they make you not show up when
          other members use the &quot; /who all guild convocation &quot;
          command, ROLEPLAY mode is a lot more desirable than ANONYMOUS mode as
          it does show your guild name (but it still makes it so you DON'T show
          up with the /who&nbsp; all guild command) however it is understandable
          that some classes or just due to your level you have to be Anonymous
          in heavy traffic zones (Shamans, High level Clerics and Druids) so if
          you must be anonymous then use the Roleplay mode.&nbsp;<br>

          able to invite him/her YOU must do so (if you are group leader for
          example), a large reason of being in the guild is to be able to team
          up more easily, if we start excluding guild members from camping a
          room in Lower Guk or Sol B because we prefer other non guild members
          players, then what's the point of being in the guild? Use common sense
          of course, a full group made up of only warriors is not a wise
          idea.&nbsp; Again if a member repeatedly excludes other guild members

          level in the server) actually NEEDS and will use the item, if there
          are two or more members in the group/groups who need it, then a lotto
          only between those who needed will be used.&nbsp; If no

          It is every single members responsibility to point out how our looting
          policy works BEFORE something is dropped, most players expect a lotto
          for items, but as you know that is our last resort for distributing
          items, so make sure to point out to them what is going on, and more
          importantly make sure you have an idea who is going with you if you
          are planning on camping a valuable item, imagine 5 guild members being
          &quot;ninja looted&quot; out of some valuable by someone we tried to
          be helpful with and invite him/her into the group.&nbsp; This rule
          basically means that if there are non-guild members in a Guild Group
          then an understanding of looting should be reached BEFORE a special
          item is found.<br>

          You can have secondary characters guilded at any time by any officer,

          <br>
          * A guild group is one that has more than 50% of guild members, 2 out
          3, 3 out 5 or 4 out of 6 is a guild group.<br>
          Also remember that if more than one guild group is participating all
          groups treat themselves as one for looting purposes.</font><br>

    <p><font color="#B4B4B4" size="2" face="Trebuchet MS">&nbsp; Our Goal in Norrath is to spread chaos, conflict and hate. Rules are followed only by
    those weak enough to not be able to follow their own path, this makes for weak individuals
    who rely on others for protection, when the time for all out war comes to Norrath all of
    this weaker individuals will be the first to fall to the more powerful and organized
    factions throughout Norrath, by promoting conflict the most fit to rule will all come
    forth and make themselves known to us, when the time for the last great conflict arrives
    we will know who will be our rivals and we will know their strengths and weaknesses and
    defeat them to claim the most precious jewel that is rightfully ours,
    Norrath, just as our
    Gods have made us foresee us throughout time.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2" color="#B4B4B4">&nbsp; Our group consists of members from many different
    races and trades throughout Norrath; from the dark and dangerous swamps of
    Innothule to
    the glorious Elven city of Felwithe to the underground Dwarven city of Kaladin and the
    dark and secluded Neriak; from the fiercest of warriors to the more arcane magic users and
    necromancers to our precious priests who guide us on the paths our Gods want us to be. We
    are everywhere. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp; Our role as the Convocation of Chaos is to gather as much power and wealth as possible
    before the last great conflict arrives and to make it known throughout the lands that we
    intend to use this power for our own purposes creating tension and conflict, it is us who
    will bring forth the tide of war and it is us who will be victorious. <br>
    <br>
    Here follows the basic beliefs that all of our members share:<br>
 </font>
    <blockquote>
      <ol type="I" style="font-family: Trebuchet MS; font-size: 10pt; font-weight: bold">
      <li><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2" color="#B4B4B4">All rules and orders from any kingdom or organization
        other than the Convocation of Chaos itself are irrelevant, to follow them would be to
        betray our beliefs and weaken us. We make our own rules and we make all others follow
        them.<br>
 </font></li>
      <li><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2" color="#B4B4B4">All items and artifacts we gain will have priority
        within our group before anyone else, this does not mean we give away our valuables to
        other members, it simply means that we make sure to provide our whole group with needed
        gear before selling it to outsiders.<br>
 </font></li>
      <li><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2" color="#B4B4B4">We share information only within our group, knowledge
        is power, to give it away is to make us weaker and abandon our goals.&nbsp;<br>
 </font></li>
      <li><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2" color="#B4B4B4">We do not begin wars with other groups without careful
        planning, a sudden conflict without preparation in our part is foolishness and will only
        serve to prove us inferior to others.<br>
 </font></li>
      <li style="font-family: Trebuchet MS; font-size: 10pt; font-weight: bold"><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2" color="#B4B4B4">We share our skills and trades with our own group for
        the minimal fee, we do not charge our members and they wont charge us anything other than
        materials needed, the more wealth we accumulate as a group the stronger we will be.<br>
 </font></li>
      </ol>
    </Blockquote>
    <font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2" color="#B4B4B4">&nbsp; We help train and improve all our weaker members
        without regard for the trainers personal gain other than the gain that member being
        trained will provide to the group, it is critical we all stay within the same skill levels
        and abilities. <br>
        <br>
        This is all that is needed to be known to be a part of us, <br>
        <br>
        for glory and wealth and power and fame, <br>
