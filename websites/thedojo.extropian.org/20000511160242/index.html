<strong>Bruce Lee had a stylin' yellow jumpsuit.  --   </strong><font color="#751200">May 10, 2000 17:50</font><br>Submitted by <i><a href=mailto:jirith@thedojo.extropian.org>Jirith</a></i><p><ul>                                                                        Wheeee! I get to do a news update! Yay! Hmm, lets see...  things are slow. Everyone seems to be happily munching away at Kunark, happily getting dead repeatedly and losing xp so that they can have a rare chance to score gear that doesn't load anymore. Well, everyone but <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/display.cgi?/eqshots/level60.jpg">this guy</a>. Thats right kids, someone out there can kill a raptor a WHOLE HELL OF A LOT FASTER than YOU. Post 50, I'm kind of happy if I get a single pixel of Tang (tm) in my xp bar, while having fun earning it, for the entire evening.<p>
From The Dojo's exclusive fashion-emergency file (thanks, vendrix), we've learned that one of the rare items can, ready for this, indeed give monks a new look. As it turns out, the "Fungi Covered Scale Tunic" is useable by monks (its now in the database). Not only does it have a nifty regen effect a la the rubi bp (faster? slower? who knows, The Sensei doesn't have one, hahaha), but it also looks like Chainmail. I think <a href="http://www.gweep.com/images/greenguy.gif">Gerome</a>, another enchanter in my guild, put it best with "nah. I imagine jackie chan in chain, and it doesn't work." I guess the idea of employing ANY VIRTUES of sterotype kung-fu guys and putting in some kind of GI like the screaming 3rd graders down the street wear to kung-fu class or whatever it is would be out of the question. <p>
Lesse, what else ... oh yeah, <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/040556.html"> have a nice walk.</a> Personally, I've read tons of arguements on it and still don't know why this ever was an issue. Then again, I'm an Enchanter. Sensei will be back soon.<p>
Us here at The Dojo have a common sense of social responsibity, and recognize the wrongful evil everpresent in all walks of society, no matter how much cotton stuffing the incarnation may have. Many of you might have seen this already, but its funny<a href="http://fractalcow.com/bert/bert.htm"> every time I look at it.</a> Dojo props to Sagard Wolvestryke for that one. Bert, <a href="http://www.scientology-lies.com/whatswrong.html">scientology is the answer</a>. Enjoy!                                                                                                </ul><br><hr size=1 width=90% color=#9a8b50> <p><strong>Smack-Day has cometh!  --   </strong><font color="#751200">May 8, 2000 14:24</font><br>Submitted by <i><a href=mailto:sensei@thedojo.extropian.org>Sensei</a></i><p><ul>                        As mentioned last week, the Dojo Smack-Off is officially on ... <a href="http://thedojo.extropian.org/misc/smackoff.php3">check the Smack-Off page</a> for details (contest closes 5/31/00).
<p>
Secondly, the union typing monkeys added a friggin' ton of new gear to the database.  Then I noticed that none of the items were in the database, so yours truly got to re-enter every single one again (friggin' monkeys) -- most of the new Expansion stuff should be in there now, so check it out.  I hate listing all the stuff, but I'll give ya a hint -- check the shoulder equipment out, there's a nice new suprise in there.  Dojo props to Elsi, Imari, Raphayl, Alex, Anthony, Greg, Thand, my grandmother, 1 of my cats and mocha Frappuccino.
<p>
Next, Tesh emailed me with a nifty way to work safe fall.  Find an angled ladder, then
load yourself up with 4-5,000 copper and back off it, etc.  Apparently the damage you take
from falling is directly related to you weight (makes sense, really).  Thanks for the tip Tesh!
<p>
Hmm, what else ... oh, two more thangs.  One, I'm outta town Wednesday - Friday for the
annual secret meeting of the Illuminati Pr -- err, a wedding in Wisconsin, so Jirith, enchanter
extraordinaire and host of this here Dojo will be doing the news.  And secondly, just got back from two close friend's wedding this weekend ... props to them for a great wedding, and for inspiring today's humor linkage ... <a href="http://www.theonion.com/onion3317/stripperreally.html">enjoy</a>!
o' humor is right here, enjoy!                                      </ul><br><hr size=1 width=90% color=#9a8b50> <p><strong>Too sexy for Milan, New York and Japan ...  --   </strong><font color="#751200">May 5, 2000 19:27</font><br>Submitted by <i><a href=mailto:sensei@thedojo.extropian.org>Sensei</a></i><p><ul>                        Not a whole heapin' helluva lot for ya today peeps.  One thing though for you newbie Iksar monks working on the Shackle quests:  you get the Shackle of Dust when you turn in your newbie note.  It would be a very good idea to bank it at this point, because if you die and your corpse decays (something like 30 minutes to decay below level 6 I think), voila!  No shackle quests for you, senor.  Think about it.
<p>
Secondly, some items and quests in the email I'll add in when I get back in town Sunday ... till then, <a href="http://members.home.net/turnertribe/falconspride/harmy.html">check this out</a>, definitely chuckle-worthy.  Have a good weekend!
        </ul><br><hr size=1 width=90% color=#9a8b50> <p><strong>Announcing the Dojo Smack-Off  --   </strong><font color="#751200">May 4, 2000 15:37</font><br>Submitted by <i><a href=mailto:sensei@thedojo.extropian.org>Sensei</a></i><p><ul>                                 Some wee lil' news, then a big one.
<p>
First, a quick Abashi-ism on Iksar monks from yesterday:
<p>
<ul>
Confirmed from a test server player that the only thing that Iksar monks lack is the natural haste that human monks have been given.
<p>
<strong>No they don't.</strong>
<p>
</ul>
Abashi, what are you trying to say?  Heh.
<p>
Secondly, the Avs won in OT last night to go up 3-1 in the series with the Wings.  I've received several emails about my being an Avs fan from Red Wings fans lately, and I just wanted to say that regardless of your hockey affiliation, all monks are welcome at the Dojo.  And I also wanted to say BAHAHAHAHAHAHA, suffer you dirty Red Wings fans!  Thanks.
<p>
Lastly, the Big News(tm).  I've been thinking for a few days about us hitting 1,000,000 hits last weekend and all the nice emails and comments we've received.  I think the site's doing well, but the thing about community websites is, we (the webmasters) only provide the framework.  When it all boils down to the essence, the site's only as good as the community is, be it through strength of the boards, your emails with quest info and new items, or just the kind word keeping us going.  
<p>
And, well, I thought it'd be fun to do something nice in return.  So here's the deal, Dojotians.  I'm going to hold a little contest this month with fabulous prizes and eternal glory to the winner.  More info <a href="/misc/smackoff.php3">here</a>.
<p>
Today's humor link is a user submission but it looks familiar enough (i.e., think I may have used this a month or so ago) that I'll just put up two to be safe.  So Dojo props to Jamie T. for <a href="http://www.themushroom.com/mush0217/godchargingforreality.html">this one</a>, but if we have used it, here's a lil' <a href="http://raccoon.hypermart.net/elian_true/">backup site</a>. 
                               </ul><br><hr size=1 width=90% color=#9a8b50> <p><strong>Quick equipment database update  --   </strong><font color="#751200">May 3, 2000 17:01</font><br>Submitted by <i><a href=mailto:sensei@thedojo.extropian.org>Sensei</a></i><p><ul>        Jirith implemented today a new feature of the equipment database to show what equipment is wearable by the two monk races (he also lowered the font size a bit to make it display better).
<p>
However (incoming caveat warning), because of the sheer amount of items in the db, we had to default these to yes/yes (check the database, you'll understand what that means) for 99% of the items.  What does that mean?  Two thangs.  First, don't use that as gospel for a few weeks till we get the data sorted out.
<p>
Secondly, and most importantly, we need your help correcting it!  If you see something in there that is marked Iskar-only or human-only and it's not right, let us know!  The usual Dojo props will apply.
<p>
Thanks, and hope you keep enjoying the site!        </ul><br><hr size=1 width=90% color=#9a8b50> <p><strong>Interview correction and more (so much, much more!)  --   </strong><font color="#751200">May 3, 2000 15:22</font><br>Submitted by <i><a href=mailto:sensei@thedojo.extropian.org>Sensei</a></i><p><ul>                First, got another email from Abashi this morning, he typoed a response on the shiverback question from yesterday's interview (however, even though it's his mistake, we still have to beat a union typing monkey - those are the breaks).  Correction is:
<p>
<ul>
<strong>S: Now that the Expansion is out, could we possibly get a status update on the much-anticipated Shiverback upgrade?</strong>
<p>
A: Now now Sensei :) As mentioned in the previous interview, we've agreed to take a look at it, but have <strong>not</strong> committed to an upgrade at this point. The team is definitely tied up for about the next month on various things, including taking care of any issues that pop up in Kunark. June looks to be a good timeframe for us to take a look at this issue. 
<p>
</ul>
I think I liked it the old way, didn't you?  Urgh.  Just so we're clear though, Peabody, set the Wayback Machine to March 6, Year 2000:
<p>
<i><ul>Someone sent me an email yesterday outlining some pretty compelling issues with some of the monk stuff. Specifically mentioned was the fact that a lot of the pre-plane stuff has better stats than shiverback. I'm looking this info over now. 
<p>
As for AC in general, Monk pieces will always be pretty low in AC due to the fact that monks get an AC bonus just for being a monk. But I do think that the plane gear should probably be better than the mundane stuff. 
</i>
</ul>
<p>
Abashi also hit this in <a href="http://thedojo.extropian.org/misc/abashi032200.php3">our last interview</a> as mentioned.  I just wanna make this clear so we don't get the typical "Abashi promised us" threads over this -- lesse what happens first, and then let loose the cannons o' schmack.  No premature-eschmackulations, in other words. 
<p>
In other Abashi news, monk community member Amiji from Rallos  got an update on the Whineplay Forum about the Robe of the Lost Circle quest:
<p>
<ul>
Abashi - Is the monk robe quest still on the 'fix list'?
<p>
<strong>It's on the re-evaluation list still.</strong> 
<p>
2) The 'combine' attempt when all the pieces are assembled has a chance of failing. Since the quest is so expansive, perhaps the final combine can be made to not fail. 
<p>
<strong>As long as it takes to acquire all of the items for it, this sounds a little severe.</strong>
</ul>
<p>
After reading this, we of course sent out the crack union typing monkey commando team to get the inside scoop.  It appears there are three lists that a change must progress through before it is implemented.  First, the "re-evaluation list," which is sort of a not-quite-on-deck holding tank.  Assuming the idea makes it out of here it goes to the "fix list," home of such age-old ideas as "/guildwho" and being able to change the text-box display colors (all the stuff /feedback'ed from last April, in other words).  
<p>
However, there is one more list, that our deep cover operatives have discovered -- the "we need to fix this before the monk community starts Fedex'ing us dead squirrels list."  Hint hint.*
<p>
<ul><i>* This is not intended to be a suggestion to email dead rodents to Verant.  In fact, we disavow all knowledge of such a statement, Senator.</i>
</ul><p>
Today's humor linkage is none other than <a href="http://evermahir.webjump.com/">EverMahir</a> ... enjoy, and make sure you try the "Auto-Smed."                         </ul><br><hr size=1 width=90% color=#9a8b50> <p><strong>More monk tidbits than you can shake a stick at  --   </strong><font color="#751200">May 3, 2000 3:27</font><br>Submitted by <i><a href=mailto:sensei@thedojo.extropian.org>Sensei</a></i><p><ul>                                                Checked the inbox before I crashed tonight and behold!  Abashi got back to me on my latest email.  Some tantalizing tidbits for ya's ...
<p>
<ul>
<strong>Sensei: Does the monk's inate haste effect when using hand-to-hand continue to move higher (lower delay) throughout the Expansion levels, or does that effect stop gaining momentum at 50?</strong> 
<p>
Abashi: Yes, the hand-to-hand innate haste continues to improve as the monk gains levels over 50. They get two or three improvements. 
<p>
</ul>
Or perhaps this one ...
<p>
<ul>
<strong>S: In terms of the sashes/headband quests, is it intended that monks cannot get all the sashes and headbands via quests and must instead kill their own guildmasters? Assuming we're not just missing something and quests for these are not implemented currently, will they be at some point?</strong> 
<p>
A: We took those particular quests out in beta, and the fact that those items load on the guildmasters is left over from those days. They aren't used elsewhere in game. </ul>
<p>
Much more mysteries o' monkdom revealed in this one, <a href="http://thedojo.extropian.org/misc/abashi050200.php3">so check it out</a>.  And as always, major Dojo props to Gordon for taking the time out to answer our questions.                </ul><br><hr size=1 width=90% color=#9a8b50> <p><strong>You're balanced (at least till the next nerf)  --   </strong><font color="#751200">May 2, 2000 11:52</font><br>Submitted by <i><a href=mailto:sensei@thedojo.extropian.org>Sensei</a></i><p><ul>        Lot of interesting stuff today, so let's get to it.  First, a couple of Abashi-ism's, starting with comments from yesterday on Iksar versus human monks:
<p>
<ul><strong>
Previously, with only one class capable of becoming a monk, balancing the monk class on the basis of race was not difficult. However, the inclusion of the Iksar, with many different racial attributes, has made this a bit harder. 
<p>
Infravision and regen make life much easier for the young Iksar, which leaves us with a need to validate humans as a monk class. In addition, monks are the only race that get an AC bonus based upon their race. This leaves them already getting one just by virtue of being a monk, and now another because they are also an Iksar. 
<p>
In this case, we decided that in addition to including the expected XP and faction issues, we've also made it so that Iksar monks will not be as "good" at *being* monks as humans. It's not by a large extreme, but human monks will always be better at doing what monks do: dealing damage.
<p></strong>
</ul>
Secondly, a long one on class-balance and the WhinePlay Forum itself:
<p><strong>
<ul>
I just got done taking a look at the first page of this forum. As I'm sure many know, each page holds 40 threads. Of the 40 threads at the time that I'm writing this: 
<p>
13 are complaining about Rogues<br> 
2 about Rangers<br> 
2 about Paladins <br>
1 about Wizards <br>
1 about Magicians<br> 
1 about Druids <br>
1 about Enchanters <br>
1 about Necros 
<p>
That's over half of the posts on the first page that basically consist of "My class isn't balanced, isn't powerful enough, isn't desired in groups, can't do something some other class can." or something along those lines. The other 18 posts are perhaps issues that we'd like to answer, but people constantly bumping the class-envy posts keeps pushing them down. That isn't fair to the people who have issues that we can and are willing to address or do something about. 
<p>
I'm very sorry if we haven't been able to give everyone the answer that they are looking for in regards to their class, but being as clear as possible, notwithstanding current planned and announced enhancements, we consider all classes to be essentially well-balanced at this time. This means that we feel that there is a compelling reason to play each class beyond the desire to roleplay. It does not mean that every class is equivalent in offensive power, desirability to a group, or has some unique special skill or ability, just that there are tangible reasons someone might choose to play your class. 
<p>
I don't wish to get involved in the unending recursive arguments that surround class-envy posts any longer (e.g. Explain how we are balanced, what is the compelling reason to play us, etc). This is all meant to be part of the discovery process in the game. Part of the process where everyone finds out what character class suits them. We can’t tell you what you should like about your class, and if there is no other way to convince to you like your class other than to start handing out enhancements, then we may be at an impasse. 
<p>
If you wish to keep discussing these issues on our boards, it’s perfectly fine. We’ll read them and we may respond to some issues raised from time to time providing that the content is respectful and the answer would be of benefit to players as a whole, but we won’t feel compelled to answer class-envy posts regardless how many people comment in them. We’ll close the threads when they hit between 300-400 posts, and if the number of threads reach spam proportions (like the 13 rogue posts on the first page), we’ll start closing them before that. 
<p>
It is not at all our intention to suppress anyone’s ability to discuss these issues, but we want to be sure that people with issues that we can address, and that we’d like to address, have priority on the boards. 
<p>
Thank you for understanding, and I do intend to follow up on this thread today if content allows. 
<p>
</ul></strong>
Notice what class isn't on that bitch-list.  Imagine that.
<p>
Lastly from the news front, seems the equipment load tables in several Kunark zones were hosed the first week, which explains some of the ungodly equipment found.  This has been changed and you should notice a severe change in load rates going forward.
<p>
The items keep pouring in, and yes the union typing monkeys and I are still working on the quest stuff mentioned yesterday, so stay tuned.  Today's humor link is <a href="http://hcs.harvard.edu/~tabanger/movies/agd/">'dis one</a> (Dojo props to Wolvinsbane from Mith-Marr for that one).                    </ul><br><hr size=1 width=90% color=#9a8b50> <p><strong>In a rush?  No problem, just use the cured silk texture!  --   </strong><font color="#751200">May 1, 2000 15:09</font><br>Submitted by <i><a href=mailto:sensei@thedojo.extropian.org>Sensei</a></i><p><ul>                Lots to talk about today, so let's get to it.  First of all, sometime yesterday the Dojo reached 1,000,000 hits.  Not sure what to say about that except, well, "thanks," and we appreciate your patronage.  No, UGO and clones, this does NOT mean we want a new host.
<p>
Now to the good stuff.  Turns out some new mid-level monk-only armor has been found in the Crypt of Dalnir.  Stuff is not bad but it is NODROP (items I've been emailed on are now in the database).  Here's the funny part ... can you name that texture?  (Cured Silk)  I knew you could!  Sheesh, come on Verant, throw us a frickin' bone here.
<p>
Secondly, Karnor's Castle has yielded a new monk-only 2-handed blunt, the Tranquil Staff (Dojo props to Obmar of Tarrew Marr and all the others who sent me this one).  Heavy as hell (10), but nice damage and procs "One Hundred Blows."  A lot of monks who have gotten this have said that the proc does not work -- whether this is a bug or it requires a higher level is still unknown.  
<p>
Couple other items added to the equipment database today, so check 'em out!  Also, working on getting the Iksar quests and a few Qeynos ones I was missing in today.
<p>

Next, a quick note about the equipment database -- we are reworking the database a bit to show you whether an item is wearable by humans and/or iksar monks (since some items are not equipable by one or the other).  We'll hopefully get this live by the end o' the week, so be patient ...
<p>
And that's all the news that's fit to print today ... your humor linkage du jour is <a href="http://www.adcritic.com">this one</a>, enjoy (Dojo props to Devan for this one).  Check the one for chipshot.com in the Top 10.                      </ul><br><hr size=1 width=90% color=#9a8b50> <p><strong>Your new name will be the 'fry chef of damage'  --   </strong><font color="#751200">April 29, 2000 13:54</font><br>Submitted by <i><a href=mailto:sensei@thedojo.extropian.org>Sensei</a></i><p><ul>        Ghitming from Bristlebane managed to get a monkly response outta Abashi late in the week:
<ul>
<p>
Seems that the skill cap increases for our primary skills (HTH , 1HB, Offense, Defense, etc)have run into a hard cap of 252. I know this must be a programming issue, but it has had the effect of weakening us relative to our melee brethren (ie, Warrior offense increase from 200 to 240 - Monk offense increase from 240 to 252.)
<p>
<strong>Not really. We've accounted for any data-type mandated caps in code. Though you may stop skilling due to reaching 252, you'll still get better as you level. The gap may close a little bit, but not by any great extent. 
<p>
Please keep in mind that a classes power relative to another class changes as they level up. It's not something that is fixed in stone. 
<p></strong>
Is it still Verant's vision that Monks be the "kings of melee?" 
<p>
<strong>We're beginning to dislike the "King of..." and "Master of.." titles that have been floating around. It gives classes the impression that all classes should be the master of "something", where "something" must be something that "matters". The only real important thing here is that some classes must be better and worse at some things than other classes. One class need not be the master of something. Maybe instead they are second-best at a few things. 
<p>
In any case, monks will still do more melee damage in a toe-to-toe fight than the others.</strong>
</ul>
        </ul><br><hr size=1 width=90% color=#9a8b50> <p><strong>Thanks, and please add me to the list of Known Arms Traffickers  --   </strong><font color="#751200">April 28, 2000 15:47</font><br>Submitted by <i><a href=mailto:sensei@thedojo.extropian.org>Sensei</a></i><p><ul>        Couple 'tings going into the weekend.  First, I confirmed last night in person that Wu's Trance Stick is not in fact a hoax (congrats to Ralik on E-Marr for getting one btw, you complete bastard), so it's now in the database.  Very, very nice item.
<p>
Secondly, as those of you who follow this daily journal of sorts know, I had to buy the Retail version on Tuesday (25th) to get into Kunark because the Expansion I ordered for overnight delivery on the 6th didn't get there in time.  Well, I finally got it yesterday.  Then I got it again today.  Nice distribution company, fellas.  Little did we know Zomax was Spanish for "Married Cousin's Shipping, Inc."
<p>
Well, short of mentioning the minor fact that the Avs DESTROYED the Red Wings last night to go up 1-0 in the series, I think that'll about do it.  Today's humor link is an old favorite of mine; there's something about that "Heard loud noise, looked up." that kills me.
