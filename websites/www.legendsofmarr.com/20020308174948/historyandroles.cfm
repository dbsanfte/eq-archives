<font face=arial size=1 class=contentmed><font color=purple>
Jez, Aurreal and Lithel met each other as Tunare brought them together in Faydwer...
<br><br>

....new and hungry for adventure on the Luclin server... they found dishonesty and
evil seeds planted within the ranks of Tunare... they were pushed back by those
who are hungry for the darkness and shun the light...
<br><br>

They gave up the fight and traveled to the Rathe server, hunting trails from
crushbone to BB with many side adventures that continued once they passed the
shores of Faydwer to Antonica...
<br><br>

Many adventure have become campfire Legends that are told to those who would
follow in our footsteps, in order to fight back the darkness and bring truth and
light to those who would fight beside us....
<br><br>

Jez and Aurreal in time became convinced that more effort was needed to fight
the darkness and started the first guild of Heros on the Rathe.... these Heros
were about friendship, integrity and truth.... Heros to help others and to stand
against the darkness... Heros that would become Legends...
<br><br>

Many flocked to the Flag and Standard that was set by the Heros....many
a road and adventure became a journey that was soon to be renamed Legends of
Marr on the Rathe server... (Jez account)
<br><br>


In time, Jez, Aurreal and Lithel sought out new lands, new adventures, thus they 
 travelled to the land of Zebuxoruk.


Many a friendship and hero was left behind and the sadness can not be accounted
for in simple thoughts and songs....
<br><br>

Legend of Marr was reformed on the Rathe server (no S behind Legends) by those
that stayed behind... We left many a friend there who, at times, visit us and are 
welcomed to us with open arms.
<br><br>

Legends of Marr was reformed on the Zeb server by Lithel, Jezebelle and Aurreal, and is governed by the High
Council providing guild leadership and the power to
enforce the High Councils authority over the guild.
<br><br>


We know that...<br>
.... one person can destroy
leadership and the moral of a guild very quickly....
<br><br>

At no time will we allow any single person, to become a self appointed leader of
Legends of Marr....
<br><br>

As the ones who holds guild leadership powers, we will enforce the Guild Charter
with an iron thumb over those that think it should be run differently without
the consent of the High Council....
<br><br>

<b>The Legends continue....</b>

<font color=red><b>Legends of Marr-Zebuxoruk is born</b></font>.
 After the move to Zeb, Lithel, Jezebelle and Aurreal sat down and
discussed what was most important to them in a guild.<br>
  <li> Nice people, good people,  people first (nice people can form a
raid-capable guild as well as greedy nasty ones)<br>
  <li> A tightly-knit group of people willing to help each other<br>
  <li> A guild that wants to group with each other.  To be able to log on and
ask for a group, and while its not always possible, to group with their
guildees<br>
  <li> A raid-capable guild with an eye towards planes, high level areas, epic
quests<br>
  <li> A structured guild with member involvement.  Councils that the members
can join and run.<br>
  <li> A voting system, and equal rights.<br>
  <li> Respect for all members.<br>
 <br><br>

<A NAME="GS1"></a> <b><font color=red>GUILD STRUCTURE</font></b><br>
It was decided to put councils in place and let the councils handle their own
areas with
 High Council (HC) as an oversight council ONLY when needed.  Each
of the HC officers has dual-roles.  They are HC officers as well as
leaders/involved members in the functions of the guild.<br><br>

This is a lot of work, it takes time and dedication and it is certainly a
thankless task.  They have chosen this path for themselves, and although difficult, 
each have a responsibility to do the best in
their designated areas without looking for glory or power.<br><br>

A listing of the High Council officers will be maintained at the top of the Guild Chat forum

<b>On Setting Guild RULES</b>:  HC officers do not make guild rules
individually, the majority rules.
Generally, HC will post a new rule for vote by the general membership.  In rare
instances, HC will set a rule without the general membership vote.  Rules are
needed as guidance, but too many rules are not good. Thus, it is preferred and
the rule of thumb to have the entire guild voting for any new rule.  No single
officer of HC may set a rule without the concurrance of the other HC
officers.<br> (Exception: Core Foundation of the guild structure is the responsibility of 
the Founders. It is Jezebelle's responsibility to refine, update, enforce, and 
assist in building the structures of the guild and the councils. <A HREF="#GS2" onMouseOver = "self.status='Guild Structures' ; return true" onMouseOut = "self.status='' ; return true"><u>See Guild Structures</u></a>) <br><br>

<b>Senior Officers Term Limit</b>: There is a term limit of 6 months on Senior Officers of the 
 High Council. Senior Members coming up for new vote (incumbent) will automatically be put 
  on the ballot without the need for nomination. This exclude Guildleaders.<br><br>
  

<b>Involvment in other councils</b>: HC lets the councils do their thing, and as
long as it does not impact the guild
negatively, they are allowed the freedom to do what they need to do.
<br><br>
<b>Position of Trust: Heavy handed tactics</b>, power tactics by High Council officers 
are <b>prohibited</b>. High Council members may not, under any circumstance, 
abuse their position by making statements that reflect that they are "the power". 
HC members will discuss policies and issues and determine how the response will be formulated. 


<br><br>
<b>Serving on other Councils</b>: HC Officers may not serve on more than ONE council in addition to the HC.<br><br>

<b>HC Ranking</b>: GuildLeaders are Ranking Senior Officers and have the power to enforce the 
Guild Charter and High Council Responsibilities. They are also responsible to ensure High Council 
members follow this guide.<br><br>

<b>Removal of HC Officer</b>: An HC officer may be removed by two-thirds majority vote by other
HC officers.  An HC officer may be disciplined by Lithel (suspension, temporary
revocation of powers, immediate removal from guild pending vote by HC).<br><br>

<b>Voting</b>: Each Senior Officer of the High Council is equal, each officer has 1 vote in any issue.<br>
The only exception is Guild Discipline who is Lithel.

<A NAME="AO"></a><font color=red><b>ALL Officers:</b></font><br>

<b>RESPONSIBILITY</b><br>
As Officers of LoM we are equal in our responsibilty to uphold the guild rules, charters, goals and ideals<br><br>

This means that your <b>leadership skills</b> are used to diplomatically handle complaints, 
monitor negative or problem guild chat, represent guild leadership, 
help others, contribute actively in the councils you are a member of, and generally set an
 example for the members.<br><br>

<b>No single person handles all complaints</b> in the guild and all officers should make themselves available to LoM members in all aspects of the game. 
<br><b>This does NOT include guild DISCIPLINE</b>.  If an issue becomes problematic, refer it to Lithel.  <A HREF="#GD" onMouseOver = "self.status='Guild Discipline' ; return true" onMouseOut = "self.status='' ; return true">See GUILD DISCIPLINE for more information.</a><br><br>

<b>IF....</b><br>
..........you see something negative or anything against guild policy in guild chat then as an Officer you should be "watch the potty mouth please" when rules are not being followed.<br>
..........you see open and negative game play in guild chat "shut it down!"<br>
..........you see any Officer of the guild being abused verbally in guild chat " then you need to shut down" and send them to private tells and post it here in Officers Lounge for us to deal with<br>
..........you see any member being bashed in guild chat "shut down the activity!" and post here for the leaders of guild to know about<br>
..........you see complaints about the guild, they are to be kept out of guild chat.  This just throws fuel on the fire.  Post it in Officer Lounge<br><br>

There is always more than one Officer online at a time. Officers always support and get ideas from each other if there is an issue that arises.<br><br>

We are committed to each other in friendship and respect.<br> 
No Officer should act like he or she is above other guild members.  
There is no 'Glory' in being an Officer.  Officers are volunteers who help nuture the guild.<br>

<br><br>

<b>Limitation on involvement in Guild Chat forum</b>: 
All Officers are banned from using their Officer status in the Guild Chat forum. 
Any grievance or complaint issues will automatically be moved to Grievance and Complaints forum. 
<br><br>





<A NAME="GD"></a><font color=red><b>GUILD DISCIPLINE</b></font> (Lithel Valequenta)<br>

<br><br>
<b>HC Officers Limited</b>: High Council officers are limited in taking 
action in discipline issues unless the issue involves a negative impact 
to the guild was approved. Lithel is Guild Discipline Officer and 
will remain solely responsible for that position. 
This does not include enforcement of rules 
(i.e. no negative or disruptive or cussing chat in our online guild chat). 
<br><br>

Lithel has the GuildLeader powers necessary to effectively handle his
responsibilities to the guild.
<br><b>Guidelines: It is Lithel's responsibility</b> to handle guild discipline. 
If the council decides a member needs to be removed, they are to be removed by
Lithel only.  He is the only HC officer who can remove, suspend, revoke powers,
or discipline a guild member in any way.  IF Lithel is NOT on and an issue
arises that involves a problem with a member, HC officers should try to resolve
it diplomatically.  If that does not work, do not pursue the issue, refer it to
Lithel.<br><br>
Lithel MAY REMOVE a member for cause (the only exception to any other HC officer
removing a member,  is a member causing havoc in guild chat or with the guild,
and then it must be discussed with ALL
other HC officers online at the time before removing a member without Lithel).
<br><br>
<b>A member may disagree</b> with Lithel's reasons for removing a member, but
under no
circumstance will any member show him disrespect for that decision.  Guild
Discipline is a thankless job that people will resent him for it from time to
time.  <font color=orange><b>No disrespect will ever be tolerated to his
position.</b></font>
<br><br>

<A NAME="ICL"></a><font color=red><b>INDUCTION COUNCIL LEADER</b></font> ( Lithel Valequenta)<br>
<b>Guidelines: It is Lithel's responsibility</b> to lead the induction council
(IC).<br>
 <b> The IC sets the rules for induction</b> with input from HC and RC, (i.e.
the guild needs more enchanters).<br><br>

On Sept 05, 2001, By unanimous vote, <b>exceptions to the induction process </b>
may only be made by a Senior Ranking Officer (GuildLeader) rule was approved. 
<br><br>

  Complaints about IC officers or problems with IC,
Requests for targetted membership (i.e. more enchanters), should be directed to
Lithel who will handle the problem, or pass the information to IC.  (NOTE: If
you are an HC officer and are *not* on IC, do not perform IC responsibilities.
It
is difficult to coordinate a council as large as IC without HC making
exceptions, etc.) Let IC do their job.  It is HC's job to say "The guild needs more
enchanters".
