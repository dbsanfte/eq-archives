<font face="arial" Size="-1" color="caffb0"><b>Low level clerics have a few ways 
to avoid that nasty aggro:
If you plan on having a tank pull a
monster and he's getting beat coming
in, wait a few seconds if possible
before healing him/her so the mob
hates the tank most.  Healing a friend, to the mob, is just like you nuked the monster for that dmg, so be careful with when you heal.  You also have some cool tricks up your sleeves for dealing with mobs, root it and run if you need to, or you could stun casters. Fear just aggros more mobs, so if you are gonna zone, shout that a train is coming and scoot.  Don't forget that Divine Aura!  If you are getting beat and need to heal still, cast this and sit down, you can't be stunned anymore while invincible.  Just my 2 cp, Buzze</b><br></font>
