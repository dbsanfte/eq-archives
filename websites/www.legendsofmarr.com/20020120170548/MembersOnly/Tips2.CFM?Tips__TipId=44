Before one can master the difficult and rewarding skill known as quad kiting, you must understand how a druid kites a single mob. This is relatively simple. Once a druid gets in his mid-20s he should have enough mana to kite, that is to pull a mob behind him (like a kite on a string) and do damage to it without taking damage in the process. The following describes the process.

1. Find target: This can be harder than it seems as you want to do this in a large outdoor area where you can see where you are running too. When I started kiting, I used the crocs and caiman in Oasis. There may be some better locations but I had never seen anyone kite before and wanted to make sure I had as much visibility as I could get.

2. Prep spells: At low levels, root just doesn't work, so you can't kite with it. So give it up. Memorize SOW, Snare and your best damage spell. Also, memorize your healing spell and Gate but hope you don't need them. I also memorize my damage shield and my AC buff. But that is a matter of taste; some prefer to live on the edge. The idea is that if you can save mana by not casting buffs on yourself, you can kill more mobs. For me it depends on the mob and the terrain.

3. SOW: SOW yourself.

4. Acquire target: Find your target minding his own business.

5. Aggroing target: Cast Snare on the MOB. Now is where the fun begins!

6. Run ahead of the mob. Not to far this time. Just far enough you have some breathing room.

7. Cast your DOT on him. This will get the damage process going.

8. Run ahead of the mob again. You have to find a good balance with this. You want the mob to be visible but you want to have some time before it catches you. Also, if you are in Velious or Kunark, it is possible to out run the mobs aggro. But when you are just getting started, you won't be playing in those zones so we won't worry about that just yet. 

9. Sit down. Yes...I said sit down. Med up. Turn your speakers up so you can hear the mob coming. Later when you don't need to open your spell book to med, this is much easier and less stressful. Let the mob catch up to you. The little mana you get during this time will make a difference. Do not skip this step.

10. When the mob catches up to you, get up and run some more.

Repeat steps 8 - 10 until the DOT wears off. Then go back to step 6 and continue to 10.

Do this until the MOB is dead. 

That is the simplest form of kiting and is very nerve racking, as you have to listen for the mob and judge when to stand and run. It's not like regular melee, you have to use some brains.

The Snare-Root-DOT method. 

The past time of all druids. Once you get to level 24, you get a root that is at least somewhat reliable. Enough so that druids can use it to greatly improve their method of soloing.

1. Prep spells: The only attack spells you need are Snare, your best Root and your best DOT. For buffs you will use SOW. And AC and Damage Shield are optional as before.

2. Find your target. 

3. Cast Snare.

4. Run ahead for some breathing room.

5. Cast Root.

6. Run ahead for some breathing room.

7. Cast your DOT.

8. Run ahead and sit down.

9. Wait for mob to catch up.

10. Stand and run again.

11. Repeat steps 8 - 10 until your DOT wears off.

10. Go back to step 6 and continue to step 11.

Note: If you mob breaks root...and he will, stand and recast root.

Quad kiting 

This is the stuff! Quad kiting is the method used to kite up to four mobs at once. This is not possible until level 34 as you need an AoE (Area of Effect) spell to execute this procedure.

1. Buffs: Best Skin spell, SOW, best damage shield, best Regen (if you have it), when you have all these buffs on you, make sure you keep SOW mem'ed. NEVER quad kite without SOW mem'ed.

2. Prep spells: Snare, best AoE spell, SOW, Gate, and best root spell. Also, you might add best DD, best DOT and best Heal spell.

3. Find your target. The best place I have seen for the level 34 druid to quad kit is in Fireona Vae, just south of the Drolvarg fort. There is a small grove of trees where no mobs wander or spawn. Plus, you just go a little north and you will find an area rich in targets to choose from. Drolvargs come in 4 types in this area. Listed easiest to hardest: Savages, Scavengers, Growlers, Snarlers. A level 34 druid can take Savages and Scavengers but will not have enough mana to take down the Growlers and Snarlers unless they kite one at a time. But this also means a druid can come to this area and by starting with the easier targets and work up to the hardest, he/she will be able to advance quickly from level 34 to around level 40.

4. Using the above information, find a drolvarg of the appropriate level and snare it.

5. Run ahead but not too far and find another target.

6. Snare target number 2.

7. Run ahead but not too far and find another target.

8. Snare target number 3.

9. Run ahead but not too far and find another target.

10. Snare target number 4.

11. Now you have 4 drolvargs on you. You need to pull them together into a very tight grouping so your AoE spell will hit them all. The follow is a list of methods that you can employ to do this and my thoughts on each one.

A. The zipper - If you have targets spread out in a line, you can bring them together by running between them. The targets on your left and right will now come closer to you and thus closer to each other, then as they get within melee range backup out of range and watch them come slowly work their way even closer to each other as they come toward you. This is a great method if you know the area to be safe from adds and you don't need to see where you are going.

B. The circle - This is the single best method for grouping your targets. Run large circles around them as they draw closer to each other, tighten the circle. You will eventually get to a point where they will hit you if you reduce the circle any more. Then you can back off and admire how nicely grouped they are. I have never had to run more than 5 circles to do this. Usually only 1 or 2 are needed. 

C. The let-them-hit-me - This is the most dangerous method and requires that a druid be pretty in tune with how much damage he can take. The idea is to stop and let the first target hit you until the rest catch up. I have used this in the past but it can very easily backfire. Druids aren't capable of taking large amounts of damage and can die quickly if this method is abused. If you have a good Regen spell, this becomes less dangerous as you can regain most of your hit points while kiting.

12. Now that you have your 4 targets in a nice, tight grouping, run ahead a bit to make sure they don't hit you.

13. Cast your AoE spell and watch for the damage they take. You will be able to tell if you hit all 4 or not by the damage messages you will get. If you do not hit all 4, then you need to pull them in tighter before continuing.

14. Run ahead a bit more.

15. Cast your AoE spell again.

16. Repeat steps 14 - 15 until they are dead. They don't always die at the same time. Sometimes you are left with 1 target that will just stop. You can hit him with a DD or DOT to finish him off.

17. Now loot all 4!

Note: The drolvargs will stop giving experience around level 40. At this point you need to move on to other bigger targets. 

And a final word on quad kiting. Quad kiting is very addictive. Knowing that you can get much more experience alone can make you shy away from groups. Try not to let this happen too often. You miss out on a large part of the game if you just play alone all the time. Plus, you can actually forget how to play in a group after awhile. Force yourself to group at least a few times per level. This will keep those grouping skills fresh.

Enjoy!
