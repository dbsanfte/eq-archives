<b>Loot Rules</b>
<br><br></center>

These are general loot rules. <br><br>

<b>Loot Rules</b> are made by the Loot Committee(LC), headed up by Justyne<br>
<font size="-2">If you have any suggestions, please post them in the forums.  Justyne wants your input!</font><br><br>
<li>Looting while on raids and grouping with each other is NBG (Need BEFORE Greed).<br>  
<blockquote>This means that an item looted regardless of value will go to the person who needs it most.  
The person must have the right class/race for the item, in other words they must be able to USE it.  
If 2 or more people who can USE the item Need it, those people will ROLL for it.  
(This rule includes ALT's who are on a Raid or in a group.)</blockquote><br>
<li>On RAIDS, if no one needs it, it goes to LomLewt 
(Justyne's mule for holding guild items and cash)<br><blockquote> LomLewt will distribute it 
to members MAINS that need it who were not on the raid, or, will sell the item 
for the guild treasury. The treasury money will be used for making jewelry, 
tailoring, etc items for guildees as well as paying for Coffins on raids gone bad 
when needed, stones or keys for entering planes (ie, Plane of Sky, Fear).</blockquote><br>
<li>PLANAR and HIGH LEVEL Loot order is NBG by seniority, the longer the member has been in the 
guild, the first right on high level loot is his/hers.  This applies to only ONE piece for his/her 
class.  They will then have to wait until all others of their class in the RAID has had a chance at 
high level loot before they can collect on another piece.  (ie All paladin collect one high level piece that 
they need before it repeats).<br>
<li>NOT on Raid, in groups of Lom guildees, loot order is NBG, if no need, then roll.
<br><br>

<b>NO-DROP ITEMS</b><br>
Do <u>NOT</u> loot No Drop items if your in a group or on a raid without knowing what you are looting! 
The item may not be something you can use but someone else in your group/raid may need it.  See NEED before GREED above.
<br><br>

<b>DONATIONS for LomLewt</b> (Guild Treasury)<br>
If you have items that you want to donate to a guild member, you can, if you wish, 
donate those items to the guild treasury, LomLewt.  The LC will distribute it to 
members who need it, if no one needs it, it will be sold and the proceeds kept in 
the treasury for guild needs. (See Loot Rules above.)<br><br>

<b>ITEMS from LomLewt</b>  (FREE for Mains)<br>
All items received by LomLewt will be distributed to the members MAINS on a NEED and 
USE basis only.  If a MAIN needs it and can use it, its theirs FREE. When an item is no 
longer needed by a main, it should be returned to LomLewt to distribute to another 
needy member.  <br><br>

<b>Extra ITEMS from LomLewt</b> (Half price for Alts who need)
If a member needs an item for an alt, they may purchase it from LomLewt (if available) 
at half the going rate.  (ie, Diamonds sell for 600pp, an alt, if needing a diamond, 
may purchase it for 300pp).  The item must be NEEDED and USED by the alt.  
LomLewt is not a clearing house for people wanting to make a profit at auction.<br><br>
