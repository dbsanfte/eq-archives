<font face="arial" Size="-1" color="caffb0"><b>In a large group or groups where there is a puller and a picker, call your target by using a hotkey or just hailing it so that everyone can be aware of what's what.  In many situations this has  made the difference between life and death, especially in planes groups.  If everyone knows what you'll be attacking, they can make sure their pets and nukes are aimed at the proper target.  And let's face it, it makes life much easier for the chanter who doesn't have to guess which mob(s) to mezz.</b><br></font>
