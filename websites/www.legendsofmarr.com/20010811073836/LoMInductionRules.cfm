<b>Guild Induction Guidelines</b>
<br><br></center>

<font color="00AAFF" size="+2">Welcome!</font><br><br>
<font size="-1">Thank you for visiting Legends of Marr. <br><br>
Our goal is to create a tightly knit (most important), experienced, 
and raid capable guild - without losing sight of two imortant things - being friendly and having fun. 
<br><br>

 Induction into the guild is determined by a set of guidelines established by the guild 
 Induction Council (IC).<br><br>
  If you are interested in joining LoM, you will find a guild application section in our forums.<br><br>
  If you are interested in further information about the guild, please check out Rules, LoM Rules, where you will 
  find general information on our raiding, looting, and general guild guidelines. <br><br>
  If you would like to speak to an LoM Induction Council Member about the guild, you will find a list under Roster.  
   IC members have a YES under IC column in the roster.<br><br></font>

<font color="00aaff" size="+2">Golden Rule</font><br><br>
<font size="-1">
It is the goal of every member of Legends of Marr, to help others and make Norrath more friendly
 for everyone. This does not mean letting people step on us however, 
 as we will be a formidible opponent should you chose to 
view us this way. We, however, wish to maintain a peaceful, helpful and friendly atmosphere wherever possible.
<br><br>
If you join the Legends of Marr Guild you’re a member of a well respected 
organization and you ARE expected to act like it. Try to get along with players even if 
 amidst an adventure you find out to your dismay that they are complete jerks. 
Any complaints about other members, should be presented to the High Council to handle.
 Avoid personal settling of vendettas and other overtly abrasive acts. 
You are expected to treat your fellow guild members with respect. 
Keep personal squabbles outside of guild functions and guild missions. <br><br>
<font color="ff5500">Loyalty is very important to LoM. 
We wish to attain a close-knit group of players here who care about each other. 
If you are more concerned with yourself, or loot - this isn't the guild for you. </font>

<font color="ffe4b0" size="-1"><b>Level Limits</b></font><font size="-1"> - Currently there is a suggested level limit of 31, 
with the Induction Council Officers each having sole discretion on allowing members as low as 25.
(Alts and real life friends and family are excluded from this rule)<br><br></font>
<font color="ffe4b0" size="-1"><b>Grouping with Legends</b></font><font size="-1"> - We encourage our members to 
group with each other whenever possible.  Group with LoM members to see how you interact with them.<br><br></font>
