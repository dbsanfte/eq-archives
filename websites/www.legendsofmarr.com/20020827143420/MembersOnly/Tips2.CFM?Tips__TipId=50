<font face="arial" Size="-1" color="caffb0"><b>Quick tip on aggro folks.  Warriors are made to take a beating.  We can dish out some damage but not as much as many classes.  As a result, holding aggro is only 1% the warriors job and 99% everyone elses.  If while doing a boss mob or on a raid EVERYONE follows these rules, aggro will stay on the MT, deaths will be avoided, mana will be conserved and adds will be minimized.

1)  All melee who are NOT the main tank need to stay at max melee range.  That means as far away from the mob as possible while still being able to hit it.

2)  DO NOT TAUNT

3)  Avoid casting Hate creating spells like snare or stun until they are NEEDED

4)  If you do get aggrod, step back, FD, or turn off attack until it is gone.

5)  In certain situations, allow the MT to hit the mob solo for 20 seconds.  WAIT till he or she calls for assistance before u attack.

Simple rules.  If we follow em things will go a lot smoother as we take on more deadly mobs.</b><br></font>
