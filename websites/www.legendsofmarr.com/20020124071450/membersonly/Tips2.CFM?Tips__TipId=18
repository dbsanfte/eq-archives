<font face="arial" Size="-1" color="caffb0"><b>The firepot room in Timorous Deep (Location Neg12000 Pos4400) allows you to teleport to 12 different tp spots.<br><br>

Fastest and safest way to get there is with Levi and sow (even if your swimming is maxxed out, it can be a long trip without levi and sow).<br><br>

For safety (so you won't drown), have someone cast Enduring Breath (EB)on you. (Druids and others have this spell)<br><br>

When you get to the wizzie spires at Neg12000 Pos4400 in Timor Deep, center yourself in the spires and swim straight down. SWIM STRAIGHT DOWN THE HOLE.  You will drop into the room where there is air.<br><br>

Do not touch, click on, or walk into any pot unless you know what that pot is.  The teleport is instant.<br><br>




I don't remember where I got this description list, so if anyone comes across it, let me know and I will give credit to the original author<br><br>

Be careful not to tp to a place you are KoS at.<br><br>
