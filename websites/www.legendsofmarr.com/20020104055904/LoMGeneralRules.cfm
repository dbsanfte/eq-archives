<b>General Guild Rules</b>
<br><br></center>

<li>Primary Rule: We are proud of our guild, do nothing that will lessen that.<br><br>
<li>All PNP Rules<br><br>
<li>No cussing, fighting or constant negative attitude in guild chat<br><br>
<li>No Whining<br><br>
<li>No /anon (it hides the guild tag and we are proud of our guild)(/roleplay is allowed, which does the same thing except does not hide the guildtag)<br><br>
<li>No begging or harassing others for "stuff" or "money" (asking for sows, tp's, buffs, rezzes, etc., are expected and allowed, but if a person cannot help at the moment, do not harass.  Its not reasonable to ask another to leave a group and travel to do a tp or even a rez.)<br><br>
<li>Be respectful and kind towards your guildees<br><br>
<li>Powerleveling is not obligatory.  You can ask, but don't harass.<br><br>
<li>Bad mouthing the Guild will result in immediate removal. Honor your guild and be proud of it<br><br>
<u>Leaving the Guild</u><br>
Sometimes a player will get upset over something that happened in the game.  They may have lost their corpse, 
got cheated out of a deal in auction, lost something of value or even have had a bad day.
Perhaps they died and no one was able to help them at that time.  Or they talked about it 
in guild chat and no one responded.  They then think that no one cares, and it has happened
 that they leave the guild or threaten to.  First of all, it may be that no one saw or could help. 
   
 That being said, we want to encourage members to be loyal to each other.  To assume first that 
 if no one can help, they really can't.  To believe that no response does not mean you are being ignored.
   We feel that people leaving the guild or constantly threatening to promotes a disloyal 
   attitude towards the guild as a whole.  If something happens that a person does not like,
    quitting the guild or threatening to is not the answer. <br><br>
    THINK ABOUT IT:  As we get bigger, people will leave for a variety of reasons.  In order to prevent a revolving door 
    policy, we ask that you think about it very carefully before leaving or threatening to leave.  
    If you are upset, wait a few days and see if the issue is resolved.  If you are having an issue 
    with another member, try to work it out.  If that fails, talk to the HC if there is an issue.  (We don't want tattling!) 
    <br><br>
    RULE: If you leave the guild of your accord, expect to have to go thru the complete induction process should you 
     decide to come back.  If you are constantly threatening to leave the guild for whatever reason, the High Council may 
      vote to remove you.  We are really sorry to have to make this rule.
