<font face="arial" Size="-1" color="caffb0"><b>Hello all,

I'm pretty new to the guild and as i read someone was requesting a raid in skyfire for the drop spells, i decide to post a bit about hunting there.

Most of the good spells there are droping of a cycle of uncommon mobs.
When you come travelling from BW zone, you reach a good safe pull point. Druid ring is on the left and you got a little mountain in front of your eyes where the mobs we seeks are roaming mostly.

There is always an uncommon mob wandering, and you need to kill him to make the following pop. when you kill one, the next pop 1 or 2 minute later.

Uncommons mobs are:

- wandering wurm (wurm). He is pretty tough, about 10/15 K hps. Resist sometimes.

- wurm spirit (wurm). Less tough and less hp than the wandering wurm, he pretty never have spell on him. Anyway the only time he give me one, it was the rare 56 nec pet "servant of bones".
 
- guardian of faelia (wyvern). maybe about 8 or 10K hp not hard to kill in solo if you got mana :). Heard rumorous it can be 51, but never experienced it myself.

- lava walker (wyvern). He is nasty baby. he can be 51 and summoner, i've find it myself :). he got 15K hp like to resist root and dots sometimes, suck my mana pretty each time i solo him at 55 and 56. He can put a poison dot in close combat.

- black scar (drake). He is a drake and cake, about 8K hp

- shadow drake (drake). another nasty one, 15K hp, he can be summoner too, same as lava walker but in drake form.

- faelia goldenwing (chromadrac form). she is used in some epic (enchanter need to charm her i've heard). she seems like a chromadrac, but a little one. She is a druid with sow, little dot, healing, fear kitting is the best way to drop her.

- eldrig the old (chromadrac), he is always 51, use in bard epic, rumorous you make him pop by killing chromadrac. He is like a chromadrac, like to debuff, aera spell, dot and slow you. Best way to drop him is fear kitting.

- Soul devourer (sperma type :p), seems like bottomless devourer, he is cake, about 5K hp.

- faery of dismay (chromadrac), another chromadrac, but she can be easily soloed, about 8K hps.


By my experience hunting there, all this mobs can drop randomly spells from 51 to 58 for the druids (except regrowth of the grove), enchanter, magician, wizzard, necro, cleric (never been very lucky on cleric and necro drop anyway)

From 54 to 58, on about 500 mobs kill i've got for sure:
- 3 forlon deeds 57 ench 
- 1 servant of bones 56 nec 
- 1 talisman of the serpent 58 sham
- 3 talisman of the brute 57 sham
- 3 wake of karana 56 dru
- 1 naltrons mark 58 cler
- 2 bedlam 58 ench
- 1 girdle of karana 55 dru
- 1 blizzard 54 dru
- 1 zurnaik animation 55 ench
- 3 54 mag water pet
- 2 evacuate 57 wiz
- 3 eye of tallon 57 mag and wiz
- 2 frost 57 dru
- 2 bonds of tunare 57 dru
- 1 fist of karana 58 dru
- 1 greater vocaration fire 58 mag

 That's for the ones i remind, i got also a lot from lvl 51 to 54 in all class.

 Best way to fight there for mad droping is a dru puller (improved invis work fine), nec for fear and mag with backstabb pet + nec pet to help kill fast.
 
 Drop is about 1 spell on 5 kill, sometimes i've experienced 3 spells on the same mob (but it was crapy ones :( )
I can't tell a mob better than other for drop, they seems all can drop every spell mentioned randomly. 

Last tip i can give is there is not just one cycle, but two.
There is always another roamer up but he is generally farer in the map and he have a huge passing that include zone from dragon circle to the entrance of overthere. You need a good puller to go bring that baby home ;) when he is in the middle of the map. But it's good to know this tip when someone is in the map yet and killing cycle too :)

In my opinion it won't be usefull to make raid there, but i'm sure a dru + nec + mag 55+ spending 8 hours there can provide good spells for all :)

Hope this post will help some of you that want to scribes spells in their books :). throw me a tell in game if you want more info on the skyfire cycle :)
