<b>Raid Rules and Information</b>
<br><br></center>

<b>INFORMATION</b><br><br>
Raids are NOT for experience.  Wherever possible, we will try to form 1 or 2 experience groups 
 within the raid teams, however, don't expect experience.<br><br>
 
<b>Most Raids are for fun</b><br>
From time to time, the guild will hold Guild Raids, 
where all members who meet the minimum level of the raid will go, and as a team, 
wipe out everything in its path.  Usually these raids will have a goal of some Phat Lewt to 
obtain if possible, but remember, phat lewt drops are rare and a raid may or may not result 
in getting even 1 item.<br> Do not expect experience or loot on these raids.<br><br>

<b>Raids for Equipment/Phat Lewt</b><br>
We will also have raids for the purpose of obtaining equipment for members. We will have 
class specific raids (ie, items for clerics), item specific raids (ie jboots), and 'all' uber 
type equipment raids (where good equipment drops for most classes).
<br>Do not expect experience on these raids.<br><br>

<b>RULES</b>
<li>Everyone who can, should attend raids<br>
A successful guild raid depends on its members and a diversity of classes and strengths. 
<br><br>

<li>Only those attending a raid may share in its lewt<br>
In fact, most high level and the best equipment is No-Drop<br><br>

<li>Listen to and FOLLOW instructions of the raid leaders<br>
Failure to do so can get us all killed<br><br>

<li>'ALL-ON-ONE' mob - ALWAYS use /assist on Raids...DO NOT USE ATTACK<br>
On a raid, particularly high level raids, enchanters will need to mesmerize MANY mobs 
attacking the raiders at once.  It is critical that NO ONE EXCEPT THE ASSIGNED ASSIST 
PERSON BREAK THAT MEZ.  /ASSIST makes it so that you are on the SAME mob as the ASSIST.<br>
<font size="-1">Example: Aurreal is the ASSIST PERSON, you type (or make hotkey) /ASSIST AURREAL.  That is the 
ONLY way to attack.  Again, DO NOT use your attack key.  If you need assistance in learning 
this or practicing, please ask in guild chat.  We will be more than happy to help!!</font>
<br><br>

<li>STAY BACK<br>
Stay back behind at the pull spot and do not move forward until instructed to do so. It is easy 
to peak your head around a corner to see and end up aggro'ing a full room of mobs.  The result 
is usually death to the raid.<br><br>

<li>TANKS TAKE YOUR DEATH, CLERICS CAMP<br>
If the raid leaders shout CAMP, this is for CLERICS (or pallies with Exp Rez) ONLY.  ALL tanks and others keep fighting to 
your death to give the clerics time to camp.  We cannot rez dead folks unless we have clerics 
(or pallies with Rez) alive to do so.<br><br>

<li>EVAC SPELLS<br>
Do <b>not</b> use Evac Spells unless instructed by the raid leaders. Evac spells only work on the 
group you are in.  Leaving others behind in a raid environment is not a good thing.  
See 'Tanks Take your Death, Clerics Camp' above.<br><br>

<li>MONKS LEARN YOUR SKILLS WELL<br>
Feign-death pulling is sometimes the only way to pull in high level dungeons.  Monks will usually 
be the pullers.<br><br>

<li>DO <u>NOT</u> SAVE THE ENCHANTER<br>
Specifically, if a mob is on the enchanter, do not leave the /assisted mob to turn on that 
mob unless the enchanter yells for help.  The enchanter will be mezzing that mob that is 
attacking him/her and any attack on that mob will break the mez causing the mob to (usually) 
continue battering the enchanter and killing them.  CLERICS will be watching the enchanters life.
 ENCHANTERS, always make sure there is a cleric in your group.
<br><br>

<li>MASTER LOOTERS<br>
The raid leaders will assign groups with Group Leaders.  The Group leader assigns a master 
looter. The Master Looter will shout out what lewt is found on the kills.  (See Loot Rules 
for distribution).  PP is split with the group.<br><br>

<li>NO-DROP ITEMS<br>
Do <u>NOT</u> loot No Drop items if your in a group or on a raid without knowing what you are looting! 
The item may not be something you can use but someone else in your group/raid may need it.  See NEED before GREED above.
Always call out the item in GUILD or SHOUT.  If item is not no-drop then loot the item and call item 
in GUILD or SHOUT.
<br><br>


<li>DISAGREEMENTS<BR>
Do not argue or fight about lewt (or anything) during a raid.  If you disagree with something, take it up 
with the Loot Committee AFTER the raid.
