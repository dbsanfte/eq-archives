<font face="arial" Size="-1" color="caffb0"><b>Well, Mistmoore can be a hell of a zone, but if you do it correct and have a bit luck, it can be a hell lot of exp and some nice loot.

Here is the strategy I used and it worked quite well.

1. Minimum Group Requirements:
1 Tank (WAR, PAL, SD)
Should be Plate wearing class because of the higher AC. He should be at least 40th Level. The Tank will receive quite some bashing, most of the time from two, often from three mobs. I was the Tank and being a Paladin was helpful because of your 39 Spells, especially Divine Purpose, the self only regen spell. And of course Downtime Healing, Buffing and LoH saved the group often. The SD and WAR sure have other benefits, taking the mob out faster for example.
1 Druid
He is the key to this strategy (see further below) because SOW, Camo and DS he provides are vital. He can be the Main Healer very well with Greater Healing. (You could replace the Druid with a Ranger AND a Cleric, but Druids are easier to find <g>)

These two can do strategy No.1 (see below). I did this at Level 41 with a Druid who was Level 33, so a Level 40 Tank should be more than safe with a 34 Druid who at this level has his first regen spell. We got exp like madmen and I found me close to 43 and him close to 35 when we left, but we will be back, I just stopped for a Guild Raid and for writing this tip <g>.

The More the Merrier people say, and when you two can add another Druid or a Cleric as healing Support, another Tank for dishing out the damage or a Wizard for those welcomed nukes, your life will get easier. Only Casters who rely heavily on their pets have a bit of a hard time, especially Mages. DO NOT USE PETS IN THE CASTLE! When you follow this strategy, you will cut a thin path through the hordes of Mistmoore's forces and a pet that is one second away from the Path will train a FULL ROOM with 5 to 7 Mobs on you. But I grouped even with Mages, and they were doing good, although the group should see the Magician as an add to the Group.

2. The Strategies
After rambling on and on, now I will finally come to the important stuff: What to do where and when. <g>

Inform the Zone
Most of the times we were alone in Mistmoore, but sometimes there are Groups or Soloers at the zone entrance. They are Level 18 to 28 most of the times and will get wiped when you train them with the nasties out of the castle. Make a TRAIN MACRO and inform the zone that when you shout TRAIN, they should zone whatever they are doing at the moment.

Insertion Guide
Get the Map from EQ Atlas. Any map can do, but I am referring to the Numbers on that one, so you might want to get at least the numbers from EQ Atlas in your Map.

All buff up at the zone entrance. HP/AC Buff (Druid, Cleric, Paladin), AC Buff (Cleric, Paladin), SOW (Druid), Strength for the Tanks (Druid), Regen (Druid), See Invis (Druid), Camo (Druid).

Now cross your fingers that Camo will hold long enough and run to the Graveyard (#1 on EQAtlasMap). Behind the Tomb (#2) in the Corner is a secret Door that leads to the Jail (#5). Next to the Door that seems to lead out is another secret wall that leads to the stairs. Climb these until you get to the Corridor that combines the Torture Chamber (#14) with the Tower (#13). When you have to evac, run on the bridge and jump down, you will be near the zone entrance and don't have to run all the way around. THAT EVAC ROUTE HAS SAVED US MANY LIVES! Make sure that everyone in your group knows where the bridge is, where he lands when he jumps down and how to get to zone from there.

Hunting
Finally you arrived where you can kill some meanies. Your Camp here will consist of 4 Rooms: Torture Chamber (#14) and Garg1 to 3 (no numbers, but I will explain it). You will move from room to room, fight the spawns, med up, get to the next room, fight, med and so on. Me and the Druid were medding only a bit and always had mobs up. It was raining experience.

General Fighting Tips:
NEVER LET THEM RUN! Root them, Snare them, glue them to the floor with edible goo, it doesn't matter. Mistmoore's Mobs have an INSANE Aggro Range. You want the Mob dead, so root it take some more hits but be safe. If it gets away, it will most likely aggro a Room with 5 to 7 fresh mobs, some of them Casters. You will get no exp because you can't finish the running mob, instead you get a nice "Deadly Mistmoore Train Deluxe" (tm) and can call yourself lucky if you get out alive and those you trained don't jump like madmen on you because you brought armaggedon upon them.

Sometimes there is a Pop on the Stairs you were climbing from the Jail to Torture Chamber. Fight him. Invis after that fight.

You start in the Torture Chamber: 2 Mobs will spawn here, either 2 Undead or 2 Dark Elves. The Dark Elves can pop in any caster/melee combination: 2-0,1-1,0-2. The Undead have a nasty spell that drains all your stamina, so the Main Healer should have invigor/extinguish fatigue ready.

Follow the door leading deeper in and when you glance around the corner, you will see two Gargoyles. You maybe guessed it and you are right, this is Garg1. Kill them and med. Med at the western wall (on the map left), facing the corridor that leaves the room again.

After you are FM again, head down the stairs, open the door and enter the next room with 2 Gargoyles (Yeah! This is Garg2). Don't make the mistake and go around the corner into Xicotl's Room (Connection A on the map). The Inhabitants can see through invis (at least one can) and you end with 10 Mobs on your back, trying to run as far to zone as possible while shouting TRAIN! TRAIN! GET OUT! NOW! Sometimes there is a pop at the stair leading from Garg2 down to Garg3. Make sure you are not surprised by him. Get the Caster first and let your DS do some work on the Gargs that should hit you. (If you are the Tank <g>)

After clearing Garg2 and medding up you go down the stairs. You should turn right now and come to Garg3 whith 2 more Gargoyles. Now you med up again and take the route back. That should be safe and easy as long as all are concentrating on their job and their role in their group. I once had someone in the group who did this:

/g Wow! I never was here
(goes around a corner)
(Health bar is going down - quick)
/yell
(coming back around the corner, with Xicotl and his new fan club on the back)
/shout TRAIN WARNING TRAIN WARNING
LOADING PLEASE WAIT

If you have someone in your group, there is only one thing you can do, hit the DISBAND Button. If you did not tell him in the beginning though, they should hit the DISBAND Button. <g>

If you have any questions about this Guide, send me a tell. When you can provide some Invis, I will show you around.</b><br></font>
