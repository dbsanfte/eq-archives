<font face="arial" Size="-1" color="caffb0"><b>Many players scoff at bind wound, but it can be darned handy between battles when there are no healers or the healers are low on mana. I recommend that you max this skill in a safe situation so that it works when you need it. Here's one way.

Go to East Commonlands. Politely ask a magician for hundreds of summoned bandages. Because higher level players are usually selling stuff there, they often have mana to burn.

Go to the tunnel.

Jump off the edge of the tunnel to the floor of the tunnel repeatedly until you get down to half a bubble of health.

Bind wound until you get to half health.

Repeat the last two steps until you are maxed.</b><br></font>
