<b>Raid Rules and Information</b>
<br><br></center>

<b>INFORMATION</b><br><br>

<b><font color="yellow">Scheduling a RAID or EVENT</font></br>
Raids and events MUST be requested thru Raid Council (RC).  This procedure is necessary as RC is
 constantly planning and organizing events (many events are in the planning stage and may not be posted as yet).  To have successful raids and events, RC needs the full 
  cooperation and attendance of all members.  It is RC's responsibility to fulfill member requests, 
  for both raids, epic fulfullment, quests and other events.  MAKE SURE YOU POST YOUR REQUEST TO RC FORUM FOR POSTING.
  For further details, see a Raid Council Officer.
<br><br>

SENIOR OFFICERS may plan any raid>br>
Senior Raid Officers may plan any raid, Planar or otherwise.
 Regular raid council members are restricted to their areas.
<br><br>

<b>EXPERIENCE</b><br>
Raids are NOT for experience.  Wherever possible, we will try to form 1 or 2 experience groups 
 within the raid teams, however, don't expect experience.<br><br>
 
<b>Most Raids are for fun</b><br>
From time to time, the guild will hold Guild Raids, 
where all members who meet the minimum level of the raid will go, and as a team, 
wipe out everything in its path.  Usually these raids will have a goal of some Phat Lewt to 
obtain if possible, but remember, phat lewt drops are rare and a raid may or may not result 
in getting even 1 item.<br> Do not expect experience or loot on these raids.<br><br>

<b>Raids for Equipment/Phat Lewt</b><br>
We will also have raids for the purpose of obtaining equipment for members. We will have 
class specific raids (ie, items for clerics), item specific raids (ie jboots), and 'all' uber 
type equipment raids (where good equipment drops for most classes).
<br>Do not expect experience on these raids.<br><br>

<b>RULES</b><br><br>


<li><font color="yellow">ATTENDANCE. Everyone who can, should attend raids</font><br>
A successful guild raid depends on its members and a diversity of classes and strengths. 
<br><br>

ARRIVING ON TIME! Getting there in advance<br>
All people who wish to go on raids should be on time unless it has been
stated prior to the raid that person will be late and arrangements have been
made BEFORE the raid to have them insert late or whatever. This means getting
ported to near the raid location the night before the raid, or at least before
they log. Our porters should not be asked to go and pick someone up 5 minutes
before the raid is scheduled to begin. This causes unnecessary stress and
irritation to our porters.
<br><br>

<li><font color="yellow">Only those attending a raid may share in its lewt</font><br>
In fact, most high level and the best equipment is No-Drop<br><br>

<li><font color="yellow">Listen to and FOLLOW instructions of the raid leaders</font><br>
Failure to do so can get us all killed<br><br>

STRATEGIES of RAID<br>
If a raid requires strategic planning and a strategy guide has been posted,
 and a member who wishes to participate has not reviewed the guide,
  they may not be allowed to attend the raid. If a raid does not take the
time to read and become familiar with the strategies RC has taken the time to
research and post, they represent a danger to the whole raiding party by being there.
<br><br>


<li><font color="yellow">ASSIST !!!  'ALL-ON-ONE' mob - ALWAYS use /assist on Raids...DO NOT USE ATTACK</font><br>
On a raid, particularly high level raids, enchanters will need to mesmerize MANY mobs 
attacking the raiders at once.  It is critical that NO ONE EXCEPT THE ASSIGNED ASSIST 
PERSON BREAK THAT MEZ.  /ASSIST makes it so that you are on the SAME mob as the ASSIST.<br>
<font size="-1">Example: Aurreal is the ASSIST PERSON, you type (or make hotkey) /ASSIST AURREAL.  That is the 
ONLY way to attack.  Again, DO NOT use your attack key.  If you need assistance in learning 
this or practicing, please ask in guild chat.  We will be more than happy to help!!</font>
<a href="http://www.legendsofmarr.com/images/settingassistkeyloading.cfm"><font color=white>SLIDESHOW on how to set up ASSIST HOTKEY</a></font>
<br><br>

<li><font color="yellow">PENALTY for NOT ASSISTING<br></font>
If someone has been proven to not /assist at any raid, they must be
ported out immediately to avoid jeopardizing the entire raiding party and
tutoring should be arranged prior to the next raid until RC/PC leaders feel
comfortable with their abilities.
<br><br>

<li><font color="yellow">STAY BACK</font><br>
Stay back behind at the pull spot and do not move forward until instructed to do so. It is easy 
to peak your head around a corner to see and end up aggro'ing a full room of mobs.  The result 
is usually death to the raid.<br><br>

<li><font color="yellow">TANKS TAKE YOUR DEATH, CLERICS CAMP</font><br>
If the raid leaders shout CAMP, this is for CLERICS (or pallies with Exp Rez) ONLY.  ALL tanks and others keep fighting to 
your death to give the clerics time to camp.  We cannot rez dead folks unless we have clerics 
(or pallies with Rez) alive to do so.<br><br>

<li><font color="yellow">EVAC SPELLS</font><br>
Do <b>not</b> use Evac Spells unless instructed by the raid leaders. Evac spells only work on the 
group you are in.  Leaving others behind in a raid environment is not a good thing.  
See 'Tanks Take your Death, Clerics Camp' above.<br><br>

<li><font color="yellow">MONKS LEARN YOUR SKILLS WELL</font><br>
Feign-death pulling is sometimes the only way to pull in high level dungeons.  Monks will usually 
be the pullers.<br><br>

<li><font color="yellow">DO <u>NOT</u> SAVE THE ENCHANTER</font><br>
Specifically, if a mob is on the enchanter, do not leave the /assisted mob to turn on that 
mob unless the enchanter yells for help.  The enchanter will be mezzing that mob that is 
attacking him/her and any attack on that mob will break the mez causing the mob to (usually) 
continue battering the enchanter and killing them.  CLERICS will be watching the enchanters life.
 ENCHANTERS, always make sure there is a cleric in your group.
<br><br>

<li><font color="yellow">BREAKING MEZ</font><br>
DO NOT break the mez until the ASSIST person does.  ONCE a target is selected, taunters 
 TAUNT or MELEES/TANKS use STUN.  This will increase the hate for the tanks and take it off 
 the enchanter.  
<br><br>

<li><font color="yellow">POINT PERSON</font><br>
DO NOT EVER PASS the "POINT PERSON" without instructions to do so.  Passing the POINT PERSON 
 usually results in the death of the entire raid.
 <br><br>
 
<li><font color="yellow">GROUPING/GROUP MANAGER</font><br>
A RAID LEADER will be assigned as GROUP MANAGER in each raid.  FOLLOW the instructions of 
the Group Manager immediately without argument.  If the group manager tells you to switch
 groups, do it.  Dont question it.  IF a group leader finds his group unbalanced (i.e. all clerics),
 the Group Leader ONLY should send a tell to the group manager who will immediately fix the 
 unbalance.
<br><br> 

<li><font color="yellow">GROUP LEADER RESPONSIBILITIES</font><br>
The Group Manager will assign a Group Leader to each group.<br> 
<font color="pink"> Group Leaders are permitted to use shout for the following purposes.<br>
 When asked by RC if groups are "READY", Group leaders shout "Group 1 Ready" (or whatever their group number is).<br>
 Any other questions by RC to Group Leaders should be responded to in Shout. (i.e. Group 1 Inserted, etc)<br>
 </font>
 Group leaders are responsible to make sure their members are "Ready", buffed, assist key hotkey, 
  have read these instructions, know who the assist is, are not breaking mezzes themselves, are taunting/stunning to 
  break mezzing, have mana, stays behind Point Person, Does NOT use Shout, is not spamming ooc to the point 
  the RC cant see messages, does not argue or send tells to RC, does NOT loot unless they are the master looter.
   Do NOT loot No-Drop items unless instructed to do so by RC.
  <br>Group leaders may request a raider be TL'd out.


<br><br> 


<li><font color="yellow">MASTER LOOTERS</font><br>
The raid leaders will assign groups with Group Leaders.  The Group leader assigns a master 
looter. The Master Looter will shout out what lewt is found on the kills.  (See Loot Rules 
for distribution).  PP is split with the group.<br><br>

<li><font color="yellow">NO-DROP ITEMS</font><br>
Do <u>NOT</u> loot No Drop items if your in a group or on a raid without knowing what you are looting! 
The item may not be something you can use but someone else in your group/raid may need it.  See NEED before GREED above.
Always call out the item in GUILD or SHOUT.  If item is not no-drop then loot the item and call item 
in GUILD or SHOUT.
<br><br>

EPIC LOOTING<br>
The item should go to the next person in line for their epic quest.
<br><br>


<li><font color="yellow">SHOUT is for Raid Council ONLY</font><BR>
Do not use shout during a raid. SHOUT is for RC only. Group leaders may use shout for certain 
things...see Group Leader Responsibilities above.
<br><br>


NON-RAID COUNCIL members, USING /SHOUT to give ORDERS <br>
If someone gets out of line and uses /ooc or /shout to give orders and are
not a raid leader, may be ported out IMMEDIATELY at the discretion of the Raid Leader.
<br><br>


<li><font color="yellow">ALL CAPS IN SHOUT OR GUILDCHAT</font><BR>
RAID LEADERS WILL use ALL CAPS when calling CRITICAL, DO-IT-NOW instructions. This is to 
ensure that raiders do not miss these instructions.  RAID LEADERS will also REPEAT in CAPS 
DO-IT-NOW instructions to make sure that all raiders are seeing it.  (I.e. BACK UP, BACK UP, BACK UP!!)
...DO NOT send tells to raid leaders saying "You do not have to shout".
<br><br>

LISTEN to RAID LEADERS<br>
All participants at any raid/event must listen and follow the orders set by
raid leaders at all times to avoid unnecessary confusion. Failure to do so
may result in removal from that raid and possible suspension from one
additional raid depending on the circumstance.<br><br>

<li><font color="yellow">DO NOT send tells to PULLERS or RAID LEADERS</font><BR>
Do not send tells to pullers or raid leaders during a raid unless you are RC or a Group Leader.  They are constantly co-ordinating
 between themselves and are in tells with the Raid Leading Group.  DO NOT make their job 
 more difficult.  
<br><br>


<li><font color="yellow">DISAGREEMENTS</font><BR>
Do not argue or fight about lewt (or anything) during a raid.  If you disagree with something, take it up 
with the Raid Council AFTER the raid.
<br><br>

NEGATIVITY during a RAID<br>
Negativity in guild channel, /ooc, or /shout during a raid may result in the member 
being ported out of the raid (after any necessary CR of course). Members who are 
going to be negative publicly, may not be allowed to continue to
participate in the guild activity. (No Negativity or disrespect is a Guild rule 
in any case and is not negotiable. Continued activity of this nature may result in 
further warnings or action from the High Council.) <br><br>

DISRESPECT of Raid Leaders during Raid (or any member)<br>
Slandering or disrespect in guild channel, /ooc, or /shout
may be cause to be ported out of the raid. (No Negativity or disrespect is a Guild rule 
in any case and is not negotiable. Continued activity of this nature may result in 
further warnings or action from the High Council.) <br><br>

<li><font color="yellow">VIOLATORS</font><BR>
Raiders who continually break these rules WILL be TL'd out of raid on orders from the Raid Leader. 
 IF you are TL'd out, you only have yourself to look to.  IF you claim you did not know these rules,
  then you should not have attended in the first place.  Sorry to be so strict, BUT the safety of
   all raiders is primary.
