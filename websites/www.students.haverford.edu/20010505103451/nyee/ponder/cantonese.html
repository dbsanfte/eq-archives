  <p class=title style='line-height:normal' align="center">When What You Speak 
    Is Not What You Write</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='line-height:normal'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

  <p class=MsoBodyText style='line-height:normal'><span style='mso-tab-count:
1'>          </span><span class="text">While many dialects exist in China, there 
    is only one written language. The oldest records of this written language 
    date back to the Shang Dynasty (1400 B.C.). The classical literary writing 
    style was officially replaced by a simplified, colloquial writing style, known 
    as Bai-hua &#150; &#147;colloquial language&#148;, in 1922 during the Chinese Revolution. 
    Archaic words were removed from this simplified system, and the writing style 
    became more speech-like, but by and large, most Chinese characters and their 
    respective meanings remained intact. Modern Mandarin speakers can understand 
    classical writing in the same way contemporary English speakers can understand 
    Shakespeare&#146;s writing. </span></p>
  <p class=MsoBodyText style='line-height:normal'>&nbsp;</p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style="font-size:10.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Verdana" class="text"><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>          
    </span>In 1949, the Beijing dialect was chosen as a standard for the rest 
    of the country, and became known as Putonghua (what Westerners call Mandarin) 
    &#150; &#147;common language&#148;. Because both Bai-hua and Putonghua originated from Beijing, 
    they are very similar. The important distinction is that Bai-hua was created 
    as a written language, not a spoken language, and is more formalized then 
    Putonghua. The further south and east you move from Beijing, the less likely 
    the local dialect resembles Bai-hua in vocabulary, and Putonghua in pronunciation. 
    And thus, Cantonese spoken in the south-east of China sounds markedly different 
    from Putonghua. In fact, speakers of Cantonese and Putonghua are not mutually 
    intelligible to each other. But because there is one standardized writing 
    system, they can communicate by writing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style="font-size:10.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Verdana" class="text"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style="font-size:10.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Verdana" class="text"><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>          
    </span>These two individuals however, are not equally disadvantaged when they 
    try to understand each other&#146;s speech. Because the Cantonese speaker can write 
    and read Bai-hua, he has the vocabulary of Putonghua, while the Putonghua 
    speaker does not have the Cantonese vocabulary. There is a more important 
    difference. Cantonese preserves many archaic features of spoken Chinese that 
    date back to the Tang Dynasty (around 1000 A.D), such as extensive diphthongs 
    and more numerous tones &#150; which is one reason why Tang and Sung poetry sound 
    better in Cantonese than Mandarin. And so the Cantonese speaker has both a 
    vocabulary and phonetic advantage, because the Mandarin speaker is hearing 
    words which don&#146;t exist in his vocabulary and whose sounds don&#146;t exist in 
    his dialect, while the opposite is true for the Cantonese speaker. This is 
    also the reason why it is easier for Cantonese speakers to learn Mandarin, 
    than it is the other way around.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style="font-size:10.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Verdana" class="text"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style="font-size:10.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Verdana" class="text"><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>          
    </span>Since Bai-hua does not resemble Cantonese in vocabulary, Cantonese 
    speakers are essentially learning a spoken language and a written language 
    that don&#146;t correspond to each other. In a sense, they pick up spoken Cantonese 
    at home and learn written Bai-hua at school. But what is most interesting 
    is that they are not supposed to write the former or speak the latter. They 
    are not supposed to write Cantonese in the same way American kids who speak 
    Ebonics at home do not write Ebonics at school. They are not supposed to speak 
    Bai-hua in the same way Americans do not speak as if they were reading from 
    graduate dissertations. But in the same way that Americans can read their 
    dissertations out loud, Cantonese speakers can read Bai-hua out loud. The 
    important thing is that neither would speak that way.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style="font-size:10.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Verdana" class="text"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style="font-size:10.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Verdana" class="text"><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>          
    </span>An interesting feature of the Chinese language is that because it is 
    not phonetic it is impossible to know how a word is supposed to be pronounced 
    when you see it for the first time. To get around this, the Taiwanese have 
    used a pronunciation guide known as <i>bopomofo</i> and the mainland Chinese 
    are using a <i>pinyin</i> system, both with the aim of bridging Bai-hua and 
    the spoken Putonghua (known as Guo-Yu &#150; &#147;language of the country&#148; in Taiwan). 
    Ironically, Cantonese speakers in the modernized city of Hong Kong have not 
    developed a phonetic system for the written Bai-hua. There is another way 
    in which Cantonese speakers in Hong Kong learn the language the hard way. 
    During the Cultural Revolution, Chinese characters were simplified so that 
    they would be easier to learn and take less time to write. Because Hong Kong 
    was still a British colony at that time, the writing system in Hong Kong remained 
    intact, as it did in Taiwan because the Nationalists did not adopt the system 
    from the Communists. So not only do Hong Kong children have to learn the traditional 
    characters, they also have to learn the written language with no phonetic 
    guide. Moreover, the written language does not correspond to their spoken 
    Cantonese. And most of them are also learning English at the same time.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style="font-size:10.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Verdana" class="text"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style="font-size:10.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Verdana" class="text"><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>          
    </span>Recently, Cantonese speakers in Hong Kong have done something that 
    no other Chinese dialect speaker has done. They have chosen to write out their 
    spoken Cantonese, which is like writing in Ebonics but without the stigmatization 
    because Cantonese is the dominant language in Hong Kong. In the process, many 
    words that do not exist in Bai-hua were created specifically for written Cantonese. 
    And many of the words in Bai-hua are used differently in this written language. 
    Written Cantonese is very colloquial, full of slang and idiomatic speech. 
    In short, it is utterly incomprehensible to Mandarin speakers, and speakers 
    of other Chinese dialects, even though it is written with Chinese characters. 
    <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style="font-size:10.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Verdana" class="text"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style="font-size:10.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Verdana" class="text"><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>          
    </span>Language often gives people cultural identity, and written Cantonese 
    could be seen as a way in which Hong Kong people forged a sense of identity, 
    distinct and different from mainland China. The extensive use of written Cantonese 
    began shortly before the Handover took place, with the creation of several 
    written Cantonese newspapers (notably Apple Daily), and lends support to the 
    idea that written Cantonese was created by a city that wanted to preserve 
    its own identity. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style="font-size:10.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Verdana" class="text"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style="font-size:10.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Verdana" class="text"><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>          
    </span>Many people think of Hong Kong as the city where East meets West. And 
    because Hong Kong is the most prosperous and modernized city of China, Hong 
    Kong people have a sense of superiority over mainland Chinese. It is ironic 
    that it is in this most modernized and cosmopolitan city of China where one 
    can find a spoken language that retains archaic features and a traditional 
    writing system that even mainland China has abandoned. <o:p></o:p></span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
