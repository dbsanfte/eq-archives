      <TD VALIGN=top>Philosophy is a Greek word that means a "love of wisdom".
	It is a pursuit of wisdom and meaning.
	<P>
	There are many situations in our world where questions can arise:
	<P>
	Should we follow laws that are imposed on us? Does anyone have the right
	to decide what is right and what is wrong? What is justice? Why are we here?
	Does our existence depend on a god? Why do pain, sorrow, jealousy, misery
	and grief exist? Can science tell us anything about the real world? Is there
	life after death?
	<P>
	Philosophy begins with questions about the world around us, but it does not
	end there. It allows us to find answers to these questions for ourselves,
	to depend on our own cognitive abilities to understand the world around us
	and not answers given to us by authorities. Philosophy examines the beliefs
	we have held onto as children and asks why we hold onto them and whether
	we should continue to hold onto them.
	<P>
	The goal of philosophy is autonomy, the freedom to formulate answers to the
	questions of identity, meaning and life.
	<P>
	Philosophy is not a field that is restricted only to a small subject area.
	In fact,, philosophical questions are raised in every subject and occupation
	area. Here are some examples:
	<P>
	1) Neurophysiology: As a scientist investigates the biological underpinnings
	of our behaviors, he asks himself whether the "mind" is distinct from the
	brain?
	<P>
	2) Nuclear Physics: Quantum mechanics tells us that most of an atom is made
	out of emptiness. Is the world made out of form or emptiness?
	<P>
	3) Behavioral Psychology: If our behaviors are shaped from a continuous process
	of conditioning, do we have free will?
	<P>
	4) Law: What constitutes an obscene art form?
	<P>
	5) Anthropology: Do different cultures have different boundaries for moral
	and immoral? Are they equally valid?
	<P>
	6) Linguistics: Is our thought bound to our native language?
	<P>
	7) Government: What makes a group a religious one?
	<P>
	8) Biology: Does a human clone have any rights?
	<P>
	9) Computer Science: Are humans just an elaborate processing system?
