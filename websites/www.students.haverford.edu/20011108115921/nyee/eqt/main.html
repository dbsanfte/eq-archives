      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Thank you 
        for participating in my study of EverQuest. This study began on 10/06/00, 
        and was part of my senior thesis research in psychology. I have since 
        graduated from Haverford College, but am still very much interested in 
        continuing my research in MMORPG's. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For more 
        detailed information on this study, please refer to the <a href="#faq">FAQ</a> 
        below.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I would also 
        really appreciate it if you could spread the word of this ongoing study 
        by telling EverQuest gamers of this webpage address. I would like to include 
        as many EQ players in the database as I can. </font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>FAQ:</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>What is 
        the purpose of this study?</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The purpose 
        of this ongoing study is two-fold. First, I want to understand in greater 
        depth some of the dynamics and interactions that my previous studies shed 
        light upon. More importantly, I want to build a database of EQ players 
        that will allow me to analyze responses across all the surveys you have 
        completed. This database will also allow me to research finer questions 
        because I can target a specific subset of the EQ population. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As I understand 
        more of a certain aspect of EQ, this knowledge will prompt new surveys 
        targeting that area. That is why this study is ongoing. You will be invited 
        to respond to surveys as they become available. The strength of this study 
        will rely on being able to refer to your responses across different surveys. 
        Thus, your continued participation will be deeply appreciated.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Wait a 
        minute, if you've graduated from college and you're not doing this for 
        a grade, what are you doing this for?</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In fact, 
        only about 2-3% of all the data I have gathered in the past year was used 
        for my senior thesis. I did most of that work outside of any academic 
        requirement. I know it sounds crazy, but gathering data from and understanding 
        EQ players was in and of itself rewarding enough to keep me wanting to 
        know more about the world of Norrath. And that is still the case. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Are you 
        going to spam me if I give you my email address in these questionnaires?</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">No. You will 
        be notified by email when the next phase is available (usually in about 
        a month or two). And you will also be notified when a newer version of 
        the report is available (every 3 months or so). Apart from that, you won't 
        receive other emails from me. And your email addresses will be kept confidential.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>What kind 
        of confidentiality can you guarantee me?</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I promise 
        to never publicize/sell/give your email address to anyone, nor will I 
        publicize/sell/give the data I collect with your email address attached. 
        Nor will I ever publish any of the data with your email identified.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">However, 
        I may quote your responses anonymously, but with the age and gender shown. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Oh I know, 
        you're one of those right-wing extremists who try to find data that show 
        how dangerous computer games are and how they lead to real-life aggression 
        and violence or social maladjustment.</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I am not 
        interested in politicized debates or slogan-based discussions. I am interested 
        in exploring the rich social interactions that emerge in massively multi-user 
        worlds.</font></p>
