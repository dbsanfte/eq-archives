      <TD VALIGN=top><A NAME=Doubts></A>The central question of Epistemology is
	"How do you know what you know?". On one end of the extreme is that we can
	never know anything for certain (the view known as skepticism); on the other
	is that there exist universal standards which we can understand and use (the
	view known as absolutism).
	<P>
	Information from the world reaches us after being perceived by our senses,
	and interpreted by our mental faculties. It is in these two channels where
	any doubt about our knowledge of the world must lie.
	<P>
	Let us cite some examples of such doubts. For our senses, biologists and
	psychologists have long recognized that our senses are not perfect. We cannot
	perceive x-rays, microwaves, UV (ultra-violent) radiation, or hear the high
	pitched calls of bats or dog whistles. Our senses can also be fooled by visual
	illusions, and are biased depending on previous experience, i.e. gray looks
	darker if placed next to white, warm water feels hot if your hand is cold.
	<P>
	As for our mental faculties, we have slips in memory, we make faults in simple
	arithmetic, we can be induced to hallucinate and we are susceptible to mental
	disorders.
	<P>
	<A NAME=certainty></A>And yet at the same time, there are things that we
	can be certain of.
	<P>
	First of all, we all must know that we know something. The following proof
	is known as a non-proof, where you show the other alternative is not possible.
	Consider the situation where you know that you know nothing. Then you know
	one thing for sure, right? You know that you know nothing. Then suddenly
	you know something. At this point, you know two things. You know that if
	you know nothing that you must know something, and you also know that you
	know something. Now that you know you know two things, you know three things,
	etc. Now you know what to say to people who say that they know nothing.
	<P>
	Of course, that is a weak example. Let's consider what there is that we can
	know for certain. We know that statements that are tautologous must be true,
	such as: "Half of all American citizens have below average IQ."
	<P>
	More importantly, we must also know that we exist. Because if we did not
	exist, then we could not possibly be thinking, since you need to exist before
	you can think. This is the logic that Descartes used to arrive at his famous
	"I think, therefore I am" statement. (cogito ergo sum, in Latin). What our
	exact form of existence is is another question. If someone came to you and
	claimed that they doubted their own existence, you should tell them to stick
	to their beliefs and shut up.
	<P>
	At this point, we must know that our senses are valid to a certain extent.
	Because to be aware that we are thinking, we must be able to perceive ourselves
	thinking. We must be self-aware to that extent. But more than that, everything
	we perceive is placed in the context of space and time without our control.
	Try to look around you and reverse the flow of time. You can't, can you?
	This can only be because the principles of space and time are hard-wired
	into our senses. But it also implies that space and time are real constructs
	in the world around us. If they weren't, there would be no space and time
	to perceive, and we wouldn't be perceiving space and time. But how do we
	know that we are perceiving the information correctly you may ask. Well,
	we know we must be perceiving space and time correctly or else we would be
	constantly confused by the world and our interactions with it. If we were
	perceiving incorrectly, then I would reach for a book and when my hand got
	there, the book wouldn't be there. Or I would be walking and suddenly find
	out that today is yesterday. Imagine the additional tenses that we would
	have to learn.
	<P>
	<A NAME=Tenses></A>The existence of our tense forms gives us insight into
	what we know about the real world. Tenses must be products of our experience
	in this world. It would be absurd to think that we created tenses and suddenly
	time fitted itself around our linguistic constructs. It also wouldn't explain
	how every culture around the world has the same kinds of tenses. Oh, and
	if you're one of those unfortunate students who bought into the old wives
	tale that the Hopi and their language that doesn't have a concept of time,
	well, it's not true. And now that we are in language, I feel that I must
	go into a small diversion into countering what has come to be known as linguistic
	determinism.
	<P>
	This is the thought that one's thoughts are bound to one's language. One
	famous example used is that the Eskimos have about 40 words for "snow". Anyone
	who has bought into this should smack themselves. Consider English. Is English
	so poor that it only has one word for "snow"? We have a word for small amount
	of falling snow - "flurry"; percipitation that is half snow, half ice - "sleet",
	snow that comes down in big balls - "hail", fine snow grains - "powder",
	bumps of snow on the ground- "moguls", compressed snow on the ground -
	"hardpack", and many more. The real question is: if we don't have a word
	for coarse snow that fell a week ago, does it mean we can't imagine what
	this would be like? If a language does not have a word for "filial piety"
	(which many Asian cultures have, and many Western cultures don't), does it
	mean they cannot conceptualize or have it? This view is clearly absurd.
	<P>
	Moreover, it cannot be that our language controls our thoughts. It must be
	the other way around. Before we have the word "chair", we must mentally
	understand the concept of a chair. The word merely labels this mental construct.
	If this were not the case, we would not be able to learn our own native language.
	The word does not create the thought. It is the existence of the thought
	that allows the word to be created.
	<P>
	<A NAME=logic></A>Now, let us return to our brief discussion in tenses and
	what they tell us we must know about the world around us. We will now extend
	this argument to logic and what it says about the world around us. This is
	my first argument for the validity of logic. Logic is a set of rules that
	allows us to produce and identify logical and illogical statements. Where
	do we get these logic rules from. A moment's thought should tell us that
	they must come from the same place we get our tenses. Logic must conform
	to our experiences. X is X because a tree is a tree. X cannot be non-X, the
	same way a tree cannot be not a tree. In other words, our logic must be a
	subset of some laws in the external world. This says two things. It says
	that our logic is valid, but more importantly, it says that the world must
	be logical. Again, it is important to remember that it is the world and our
	experiences that allow us to form our logic, the same way it is our experience
	in the world that allows us to form tense markers. Thus, our logic conforms
	to the world, and not the other way around. Because of this, it is not possible
	for the world to be illogical, or that illogicalness would have come to known
	as logicalness. If our logic were wrong, or if the world were not logical,
	we would not be able to function or exist.
	<P>
	Because the world creates our logic, not only must the world be logical,
	logic itself must be valid. We are working the way the world works. If we
	flowed against the universe's laws, we would simply die. No questions asked.
	The reason every creature living on earth today is UV-tolerant is because
	those organisms that were not died a long time ago. The reason why we are
	logical is because those beings that were not logical, those that could not
	interpret the world correctly, died a long time ago. This is a very important
	point and there are times when I feel I cannot make it clear enough.
	<P>
	<A NAME=Reltivism></A>My second argument for the validity of logic is humorous
	and logical, and it points to the absurdity of questioning logic. Suppose
	a person comes up to you and asks you why they should trust reason. This
	is happening more and more often actually with the New Age and Cultural
	Relativism movements. Well, you tell him, either you can produce a proof
	for the valididty of reason or you can't. Let's take these case by case:
	<P>
	1) Say you can, then this person should trust reason.
	<P>
	2) Say you can't, then this person should act unreasonably and trust reason,
	because if he chooses to not trust reason after you say you can't produce
	a proof, then he is acting reasonably.
	<P>
	So you tell him that either case, he should trust reason. And since this
	would be the case whether you can or cannot produce a proof, you don't even
	need to produce a proof. And yet you just have...
	<P>
	Let us look a little further. When he asks you his question, he has already
	answered his question. His question asks you to convince him with proof and
	logic that reason is not valid, but in asking you to do so, he must already
	believe in logic and reason. This is the absurdity in quesitoning the validity
	of logic. If you didn't believe in it, you wouldn't ask someone to prove
	it to you.
	<P>
	Why is all this important? Because the foundation of science and factual
	knowledge is logic and reason based. Once you accept the validity of logic,
	you can begin to appreciate how much you actually know to a high degree of
	certainty. This is the goal of philosophy: to know for the sake of knowing
	because knowledge empowers you.

      <TD VALIGN=top>Let us now infer a very useful rule from the ones we have
	above.
	<P>
	This rule is known as Denying the Consequent.
	<P>
	Proof of:
	<P>
	If P, then Q.
	<P>
	Given not Q.
	<P>
	Therefore not P.
	<P>
	1) If P, then Q. (Modus ponens)
	<P>
	2) If P, then not not P. (Double Negation)
	<P>
	3) If Q, then not not Q (Double Negation)
	<P>
	4) If not not P, then not not Q. (Transitivity, 1, 2, 3)
	<P>
	5) If not Q, then not P. (Contraposition)
	<P>
	You might be wondering why we did not just use contraposition in step 2.
	This is because contraposition can only take away negative signs; it cannot
	add negative signs. But by maintaining the rigor of logic, we can be confident
	about the new rules that we derive. It is in such ways that much more complex
	rules can be inferred.
	<P>
	And the above has all been greatly translated into English. In logic, many
	of our words would have been represented simply by symbols, but that is
	unnecessary here.
