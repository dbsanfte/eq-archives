      <p> <span class="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
        Chinese language has many interesting features. Chinese is a tonal language, 
        and uses different contoured pitches to differentiate between words that 
        have the same phonemes. Different Chinese dialects employ different number 
        of tones. Usually, the more modern the dialect, the fewer the tones it 
        will have, as languages tend to simplify as they evolve. Thus, a modern 
        dialect like Mandarin has 4 tones, while Cantonese (which dates back to 
        the Tang Dynasty AD 618-907) retains 9 tones. Words made of the same phoneme, 
        but different tone, usually are semantically unrelated. But each phoneme/tonal 
        is usually a homophone for several words. For example, the phoneme &quot;si&quot; 
        in Cantonese could mean the following, depending on tone: 1) poetry/corpse 
        2) cause/waste/history 3) taste/try 4) time 5) market/city 6) soldier/to 
        be 7) know/color 8) tongue 9) eat/eclipse. Tones in Chinese are set at 
        relative pitches to each other, thus one implication of tones is that 
        a native Chinese speaker cannot be tone-deaf, or else they would not be 
        able to speak Chinese properly.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grammatically, Chinese 
        is a very simple language. Verbs do not conjugate, and they do not need 
        to agree with gender or plurality of the subject. Languages that have 
        rich inflections have loose word order, while languages with few inflections 
        have strict word order. Thus, word ordering is very strict in Chinese.<br>
        </span><span class="text"><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another interesting side 
        note is that there is no word for either &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; 
        in Chinese. To answer in the affirmative, a Chinese speaker must repeat 
        the verb used in the question. To disagree, the verb must be negated. 
        But there is no word for an all encompassing affirmation or negation, 
        such as the &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; present in all romance languages.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But by far the most fascinating 
        aspect of Chinese is that it doesn't have a tense system. An event that 
        occurred in the past is not denoted by the past tense, like it would be 
        in all romance languages. Before we go into how Chinese deals with time, 
        let's briefly consider the function of the tense system in romance languages.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tense systems conceptualize 
        time as a linear flow, and demarcate this flow into sections through the 
        use of tense. Tense is centered around the present. On a time line, the 
        present moment is the only point that is allowed to move. The past and 
        the future are based around it.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chinese deals with timing 
        of events with an aspectual system. The timing of an event is marked relative 
        to other events in a sentence or conversation. For example, the following 
        English sentence can only be interpreted as having happened in the past:</span></p>
      <p><span class="text">1) He ate dinner, then left.</span></p>
      <p><span class="text">The equivalent Chinese sentence is given in Cantonese 
        phoneticization:</span></p>
      <p><span class="text">2) kui sik joh faan siin jau<br>
        he eat ASP dinner then leave</span></p>
      <p><span class="text">But because the aspectual marker marks completion 
        of dinner relative to leaving, this sentence could be interpreted as:</span></p>
      <p><span class="text">3) He ate dinner, then left.<br>
        4) He always eats dinner before leaving.<br>
        5) He will eat dinner, then leave.</span></p>
      <p><span class="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 
        a normal conversation, the correct interpretation would be obvious. In 
        special cases where it would not be, the word for yesterday, now or tomorrow 
        would have to be added. But notice that one would never need to add any 
        of these 3 words in an English sentence to indicate whether an event happened 
        in the past, present or future. This is because it is impossible to construct 
        a sentence in English without tense (barring special cases like expletives).</span></p>
      <p><span class="text"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But 
        because relative ordering is built into the aspectual system, Chinese 
        doesn't need to rely on a set of nouns for relative ordering. For example, 
        the following English sentence is grammatical but ambiguous because relative 
        ordering is unclear:</span></p>
      <p><span class="text">6) He eats whistles</span></p>
      <p><span class="text">A word for relative ordering is needed to clarify, 
        so for example:</span></p>
      <p><span class="text">7) He eats after he whistles.<br>
        8) He eats while he whistles.<br>
        9) He eats before he whistles.</span></p>
      <p><span class="text">In Chinese, the relative ordering would already be 
        known and no extra word would need to be added to clarify.</span></p>
      <p><span class="text"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One 
        question is whether linguistic conceptualization of time as linear versus 
        relative makes any real psychological or cultural impact. This is made 
        doubtful by the fact that there are words that clearly indicate linearity 
        of time in Chinese, such as the words for: yesterday, today, and tomorrow. 
        On the other hand, this might be one reason why Western science has become 
        baffled by quantum physics, while Taoist scriptures resonate with it. 
        It might also be an explanation for the conceptual difference between 
        the one-pass heaven/hell concept versus the cyclical reincarnation concept.</span></p>
