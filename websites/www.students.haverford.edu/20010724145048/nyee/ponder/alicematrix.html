        <b>Does the addictive nature of computer games make them something we 
        should shy away from?</b><br>
        <br>
        Addiction, defined as strong motivation towards or desire of something, 
        is not always an unhealthy thing. For example, we don't think of addiction 
        to crossword puzzles, oatmeal, or exercise as unhealthy. But the word 
        addiction is so often used in the context of alcohol consumption or drug 
        abuse, that it has become burdened with negative connotations. <br>
        <br>
        These connotations make it difficult, especially for the media and for 
        educators, to imagine computer games as anything beyond mindless contraptions 
        that can become dangerously addictive. But once we realize that computer 
        games can appeal to individuals from ages 12 to 35, and once we realize 
        that it is certain elements of these games that make them so addictive, 
        there is no reason why we cannot use these elements to create games that 
        convey social, artistic or academic skills unobtrusively. Whatever these 
        elements are, we can use them to our advantage to create educational modules 
        that children can become &quot;addicted&quot; to. And when addiction becomes 
        educational, would we call it unhealthy?<br>
        <br>
        These modules will be much more sophisticated and unobtrusive than traditional 
        Reader Rabbit clones. They will be interactive and progressive in a way 
        that matches the abilities of the individual, and at the same time be 
        able to encourage the use of those skills that need development. While 
        it is true that game-developers seldom have educational value in mind 
        when they design a game, many recent games could be described as proto-educational, 
        in the sense that they are on the verge of becoming modules that could 
        be used as teaching aides in classrooms.<br>
        <br>
        For example, time-period specific games can lend a great hand in making 
        those eras compelling to learn about. Games like Age of Empires and Pharaoh 
        resurrect the Medieval Age and Egyptian Dynasties in a way that classroom 
        maps and pictures will never be able to. These games allow students to 
        not only observe those worlds, but to step into them as well. Other games 
        like Myst or Riven allow a more introspective kind of learning. These 
        games promote skills needed to solve both local logic puzzles and global 
        intertwined problems at the same time. There are also many games that 
        develop organizational and managerial skills. Games such as Master of 
        Orion or Civilization require players to keep track of a host of competing 
        concerns including: technology, economics, industry, military, health, 
        and diplomacy. Moreover, successful game-play requires players to be able 
        to balance all these factors at the same time, and to make decisive compromises.<br>
        <br>
        People learn best when they are self-motivated to do so, and different 
        people have different learning styles. Computerized game-like modules 
        can be used to achieve both these demands with much greater ease than 
        a traditional schooling system. To condemn computer games because of their 
        addictive power would be na&iuml;ve, and would bury the great potential 
        these computer games have as an educational medium. <br>
        <br>
        Many people see computer games as wolves in sheeps' clothing, but if we 
        can channel the addictive appeal towards modules that promote interest 
        in history, science, arts, logical reasoning, organizational and planning 
        skills, then we get a sense that computer games are really sheeps in wolves' 
        clothing. Once we understand the dynamics of game appeal, we can harness 
        its power to our own advantage.</span><br>

        <b><span class="text">Does violence in computer games lead to violence 
        in real life? </span></b><br>
        <br>
        <span class="text">The media often asks us this question rhetorically. 
        The assumption is that computer games do lead to violence, and the agenda 
        is to demonstrate just how dangerous computer games can be. A very natural 
        counterargument comes to mind however. When we are angry, it often helps 
        if we can yell, or break something. Doing so relieves some of the tension 
        inside of us. Computer games are a safe way to release pent-up aggression 
        and stress, without actually having to break something. Why do we assume 
        that violence in computer games leads to violence in real life? Isn't 
        it more likely that violence in computer games helps to reduce tension 
        and leads to less aggression in real life?<br>
        <br>
        The media loves to exhibit several individuals who commit violent crimes 
        and who have played some violent computer games. They conclude that violence 
        in computer games lead some individuals to commit violent crimes. This 
        conclusion is problematic for two main reasons.<br>
        <br>
        First of all, this kind of reasoning is unable to demonstrate causality 
        convincingly. Consider a researcher who is making observations at the 
        exit of Disneyland. His findings indicate that people who come out of 
        Disneyland are, on the average, much younger than a normal population 
        sample. He concludes that Disneyland has the powerful ability to make 
        people younger. The crucial error he made is that he did not bother to 
        stand by the Disneyland entrance. He did not bother to check the average 
        age of people entering Disneyland. If he had done so, he would have discovered 
        that Disneyland has no effect on age whatsoever. When people watch the 
        news and conclude that violence in computer games leads to violence in 
        real life, they are making the same mistake. To make that conclusion, 
        one would need to show that those individuals were not violent before 
        they played those computer games. If those individuals would have committed 
        those crimes whether or not they played violent computer games, then computer 
        games have nothing to do with real-life violence. <br>
        <br>
        Secondly, this line of reasoning completely ignores base rates. Imagine 
        that the same researcher is studying how far away from their homes people 
        usually die. He finds out that people are more than 30 times more likely 
        to die within a 15-mile radius from their homes than anywhere beyond that 
        range. He concludes that homes are dangerous places and encourages people 
        to stay away from their homes to avoid dying. The researcher has completely 
        ignored the fact that people spend most of their time within a 15-mile 
        radius of their homes. Clearly, the number of close-to-home deaths seems 
        disproportionately large when compared to far-away places, unless you 
        take the base rates into account. Once we factor in these base rates, 
        we find that people are more likely to die in far-away places where they 
        seldom are, than in close-to-home places where they often are, even though 
        far fewer deaths occur in those far-away places.<br>
        <br>
        It may seem like the researcher made a really naive mistake, but many 
        people make the same mistake when they talk about computer games leading 
        to violence in real life. The media magnifies the few incidents that have 
        occurred, and people forget about the vast majority of people who play 
        these games who never end up killing anyone. Car accidents cause more 
        deaths than violent crimes which could possibly be associated with computer 
        games. Probabilistically, driving leads to more violence than computer 
        games do. Unfortunately, car accidents do not make headline news. No one 
        remembers car accidents. More than a year after the shooting however, 
        everyone still remembers Colombine.<br>
        <br>
        The accusation that violence in computer games leads to violence in real 
        life also fails to take cross-cultural data into account. For example, 
        Japanese comic books and video games, usually with unrestricted access 
        to minors, have very sexual and violent content. Many involve rape, sodomy, 
        and S&amp;M, as well as blood and gore violence. The Japanese, however, 
        are not known to be a violent culture. Their crime rates are significantly 
        lower than crime rates in the United States, where sexual and violent 
        materials are banned for minor access. Their clearance rates, the number 
        of cleared offences expressed as a percentage of reported offences, is 
        also higher than the clearance rates of the United States.</span></p>
      <p align="center"><span class="text"><br>
        <br>
        <img src="alice1.gif" width="482" height="345"></span></p>
      <p><span class="text"><br>
        <br>
        Let's also consider data we have from the Yanomano, a hunter-gatherer 
        culture from South America. They have no access to modern technology, 
        are not exposed to violent computer games, but 30% of all men in their 
        culture are killed by another man. <br>
        <br>
        If anything, it would seem that violence in computer games and the media 
        in general lead to less violence in real life. In fact, these three cultures 
        form a very nice trend. The Japanese with large amounts of violence in 
        computer games have very little real life violence. The US, which has 
        a moderate amount of violence in computer games, has a moderate amount 
        of real life violence. And the Yanomano who have no computer games have 
        a large amount of real life violence. <br>
        <br>
        But this conclusion, like the original accusation, is flawed, and for 
        the same reasons. Both are too simplistic, and fail to provide complete 
        analysis of all the data that would be needed to make those kinds of conclusions. 
        There are many more variables we have to account for, such as the individual's 
        developmental history, the surrounding social milieu and so on. We don't 
        know the real answer to this question yet, but whatever it is, it will 
        be much more complicated than a 'yes, games lead to violence' or 'no, 
        not at all' answer. And the reasoning will be much more refined than merely 
        showing violent games and showing violent behavior, and then saying that 
        violent games cause violent behavior.</span><br>

      <p> <span class="text"><b>In MMORPG's (massively multiplayer online role-playing 
        games), is there the danger for the player of losing the real self in 
        false personas?</b><br>
        <br>
        When a common phenomenon is placed into an unfamiliar context, it may 
        appear frighteningly alien to us. Because the context is unfamiliar, we 
        might feel that the phenomenon is foreign to us as well. Is it the case 
        that we've never seen this kind of role-playing? Consider the multiple 
        roles that all of us have to play in a modern society. A teenage boy is 
        a student, a son, a brother, a group leader and a member of a team all 
        at the same time. Do we ask ourselves whether the brother is losing himself 
        in the role of the son? Even prima facie, the fact is that all of us play 
        many different, and often conflicting, roles everyday and seldom do we 
        term such role-switching as dangerous.<br>
        <br>
        One may argue that this is not a fair argument because these real-life 
        roles are real, whereas those that game-players take on are make-believe 
        and have no bearing on real life. But does anyone find theatre dangerous 
        because actors take on make-believe personalities? The ability to play 
        many different roles convincingly is a great skill and is something we 
        praise and appreciate. Why do we praise this ability when we see it on 
        stage, but condemn it when we see it on a computer screen?<br>
        <br>
        Most MMORPG gamers are actually very able to distinguish between their 
        own personalities and their characters' personalities. </span><br>

        <span class="text">We are beginning to get a sense that phrasing the concern 
        in terms of a danger is misleading, and misses the point completely, especially 
        because the phenomenon is something we see all the time in real life. 
        Indeed, taking on these virtual personas may be very beneficial in several 
        ways.<br>
        <br>
        First of all, the virtual worlds that exist in MMORPG's provide truly 
        safe spaces for trying out different roles, perspectives and personalities. 
        People who are timid in real life can try to be assertive behind their 
        personas. People who want to know how females are treated differently 
        from males can switch genders and experience the existing biases. Sometimes 
        we want to be someone else, anyone else, just for a change and on the 
        way we might learn something we didn't know before. Part of being someone 
        is knowing what you are not, and testing out different roles and personalities 
        is the kind of experimenting that all teenagers go through anyway. The 
        difference is that this experimentation is much safer in these virtual 
        worlds. Is this something we should shun?<br>
        <br>
        Secondly, many people wear masks in real life already. Our families and 
        friends expect us to act in ways that may not be how we want to be. Some 
        of us get trapped in masks in real life. These MMORPG's give us the ability 
        not only to be someone else, but to be who we really are. </span><br>

      <p> <br>
        <span class="text">Some gamers indeed feel that their personas are more 
        of who they really are than how they are perceived in real-life. This 
        is analogous to acting on stage. Behind the pretense of being someone 
        else, it is actually easier to be the real self precisely because the 
        real self is protected by the pretense of falsehood. And the opportunity 
        of being that real self for a very brief moment, on stage or on a screen, 
        might give the actor or gamer the confidence to be who they want to be 
        in real-life. If these gamer personas come closer to who someone really 
        is than his real-life persona, who are we to say that these game personas 
        are fake? More importantly, who are we to say that the real-life persona 
        is real?<br>

        and perhaps misleading for some individuals, such as the 15 year-old quoted

          of ridicule! I was engaged to a male several times, but never married 
          him. I decided to turn lesbian a few months into it, as cybersex with 
          male and having that flip side was getting to be too hard, and I was 
          afraid he'd find out about me.</span></i></p>

          it may have been a cause, as I suppose gender identity is a very hard 
          crisis if you're unsure as to your own feelings. One few people must 
          endure. I'm not certain as to if this was a beneficial time. I lost 
          a year, I found myself. I used to feel I might be bisexual, I have explored 
          and ruled that fact out in an environment where nobody will judge me.

        <span class="text">I would agree that what he describes must have been 
        confusing to a certain degree, but that kind of identity confusion is 
        something teenagers all go through at one point or another. The focus 
        should not be placed on the confusion, but rather on the certainty that 
        he felt he had gained after the experience. In fact, his fuller account 
        gives one the feeling of a very healthy kind of exploration that real-life 
        stereotypes and prejudices would have made much more difficult, and certainly 
        much more confusing.</span><br>

        <b><span class="text">What are the right questions to ask?</span></b><br>
        <br>
        <span class="text">Once we realize that there are several aspects of these 
        games that we can use to our advantage, one important question to ask 
        is where this technology will take us. And one answer is that it will 
        change our lives in very important and beneficial ways.<br>
        <br>
        Even the MMORPG's we have now allow gamers to ask themselves very profound 
        questions:<br>
        <br>
        What does it mean to save someone from their death? What does it mean 
        to be saved from your death? <br>
        <br>
        What is altruism? What is cruelty? What does it mean to help your friend 
        by lending him almost all of your money? What does it mean to be betrayed 
        by your teammates?<br>
        <br>
        When, in the midst of battle, the group begins to falter and the enemy's 
        backup arrives, what does it mean to hold your ground and stay with your 
        group no matter what? What does it mean to sacrifice your own life so 
        that your friends can escape?<br>
        <br>
        These are the kinds of situations that impact out lives. They give us 
        a fuller sense of what it means to be living. Most of us, however, rarely 
        encounter these intense experiences in everyday life. Multiplayer games 
        like EverQuest or Asheron's Call have the uncanny ability to put you in 
        these situations repeatedly without fail. They allow players to get a 
        sense of how they would react in those situations. They allow players 
        to gain a kind of wisdom without the penalty of a devastating loss. <br>
        <br>
        As technology gets better and better at replicating these kinds of scenarios, 
        players will find that they are able to get a better sense of what kindness, 
        love, sacrifice, trust, honesty, and in the end what life means. Children 
        and teenagers can attain a kind of wisdom that is difficult to attain 
        in modernized societies. Virtual-reality grows to be so much more of what 
        life is all about, that environments which attain this quality can no 
        longer be called mere virtual-realities. They have become hyper-realities.</span></p>
