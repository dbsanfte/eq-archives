	Well, how does one do this. One method you can use is to start with everything
	and chip away what the word is not. When you take away everything a word
	is not, what is left must be part of the word you are trying to define.

      <TD VALIGN=top><I>A shipmaker in Ancient Greece builds a ship and names it
	the "Ship of Theseus". He then takes the ship on its maiden voyage around
	the world. When he returns to Greece many years later, the ship has become
	deteriorated, and so he decides to renew it. However, he does not have enough
	money at the moment to make a new ship or replace all the parts, and so he
	decides to use what he has and renews the hull. The following year, he renews
	the masts, and so on until every part of his ship is now made of newer parts.
	But he is a little eccentric and he kept all the old parts in his warehouse.
	He now puts all those parts together and builds a ship following the original
	blueprint. The question is: Which ship is the 'Ship of

  Paradox</I></FONT>
  <P>
  <TABLE BORDER=1 WIDTH="70%">
    <TR>
      <TD VALIGN=top>Before we untangle the paradox, let us define what a paradox
	is. A paradox is a story that starts off logically, proceeds logical, but
	ends up with a conclusion or question that seems absurd or illogical. Now
	let us try to answer the paradox by defining key terms that were allowed
	to remain vague throughout the story.
	<P>
	The vagueness of the paradox stems from two different kinds of names. We
	use a collective name in everyday speech to label things that are alike.
	Symbolically, they belong to a category that has limits. An example of this
	is "chair". There is not just one chair, but many objects that can qualify
	as chairs. Whether they do depends on if they fit the definitions and limits
	of the category "chair". Another kind of name we use is a proper name. Proper
	names are given to specific objects within a collective name category. Proper
	names are a layer above collective names. For example, "human" is a collective
	name, but "Adam" is a proper name that is being applied to a specific "human".
	The reason why people argue in circles is that they are using both definitions
	of name at the same time.
	<P>
	The most significant difference between the two is that when one labels an
	object with a collective name, we are comparing it to an ideal of what the
	category is. We all have a concept of "chairness" and when something looks
	close enough to it, it is labeled a chair. This allows for one object to
	change categories, which is convenient, because they do in real life. When
	does a clay ball on a potter's wheel become a pot? Conceptually, it is when
	there is more "potness" than "clayness" in the object. Where the line is
	drawn exactly is less important because in this model we are accepting a
	gray area. We accept that there is more than just black or white, and we
	are not worried when one object is halfway between two categories at the
	same time. <A NAME=3></A><A HREF="#Linked Questions">(3)</A>
	<P>
	When we use a proper name however, the situation is different. Proper names
	do not have categories and we do not allow two objects to occupy the same
	exact proper name. Does this mean that there cannot be two Adams at the same
	time. No, I mean that even though the word is the same, the conceptual proper
	name is different. A proper name is a collection of that object's past history
	and experience. When we know one Adam, in our mind he is "Adam .. with black
	hair, cheerful attitude etc.". When we know a different Adam, in our mind
	he is "Adam .. who is short and sort of plumpy etc.". Even though we label
	both Adam, we are quite aware that they are not the same person because of
	these mental tags which come from our experience of the object. Notice that
	collective names do not depend on past history. A pot is a pot regardless
	if the potter shaped it into a vase, bowl or urn before hand. Secondly, notice
	that a proper name can remain with an object even after its collective name
	has changed. If I name a piece of clay "Bungo", it is still "Bungo" when
	I shape it into a teddy bear, and when I shape it into a bowl (I don't know
	why I would name a piece of clay "Bungo" though).
	<A NAME=4></A><A HREF="#Linked Questions">(4)</A>
	<P>
	Consider now a time machine and we brought Adam from three years ago to the
	present and placed him side by side with the present Adam. What then? Are
	there now two identical Adams? Certainly not. We have in front of us the
	present Adam, and an Adam from three years ago. Time and age are a function
	of past history and experience. The two Adam's should have different mental
	tags. This is common sense though and we can see this when we look at photographs
	of ourselves: "Here is me when I was 2 days old, then here when I was 5 years
	old etc.", but the main point is that there is no contradiction when there
	are so many "me's" in front of me in these photographs. Time resolves any
	problems. <A NAME=5></A><A HREF="#Linked Questions">(5)</A>
	<P>
	If we chop Adam into two equal halves with a big cleaver (philosophy is not
	for the faint-hearted), what happens? They are certainly not both Adam, because
	neither half has the properties that our mental tags ascribed to the proper
	name. It should be intuitive that what we have before us are two halves of
	Adam. Can Adam ever disappear completely? No, because there are pieces of
	Adam flying everywhere (his skin flakes, his hair, his breath) that become
	other things and people. When we name something, we are naming all of it,
	even those parts that are constantly moving in and out. A piece of Adam's
	hair that fell off two weeks ago is not Adam, it is a piece of Adam's hair
	that fell off two week's ago. It is in such cases that mental tags and history
	are most important. <A NAME=6></A><A HREF="#Linked Questions">(6)</A>
	<P>
	What if Adam fell apart piece by piece until there was nothing concrete left?
	Then the physical core of Adam has disappeared, but we know that pieces of
	Adam are flying about in the world. There is no more Adam as a whole though.
	We judge present proper named objects by the mental tags they used to carry
	from the last moment. We account for changes, alter mental tags if necessary
	and then move on.
	<P>
	Let us go the actual ship problem now.
	<A NAME=7></A><A HREF="#Linked Questions">(7)</A>
	<P>
	The Old Ship is built and we name it the Ship of Theseus. This name we use
	is naturally a proper name, not a collective name. When we replace a part,
	it is naturally the changed ship that becomes the Ship of Theseus, the way
	that when Adam eats, digests, and becomes his food he is still Adam. We accept
	constant change. Also, we should be comparing an object from moment to moment,
	not from now to 2 years ago, because of our mental tags that incorporate
	past history. Thus the changing ship and changing Adam inherit their names.
	When every part of the old ship is replaced with new parts, the complete
	ship is naturally still the Ship of Theseus, because it is not as much that
	everything has changed but that continuity of identity has guaranteed that
	very little has changed. Remember we are judging the identity from moment
	to moment, not from now to when the Ship was just built.
	<A NAME=8></A><A HREF="#Linked Questions">(8)</A>
	<P>
	What about the ship built from all the old parts? Well, it is obviously a
	ship made of parts of what used to be the Ship of Theseus, but it is of itself
	not the Ship of Theseus. The real Ship of Theseus is the ship that has carried
	on through time from the beginning. Thus now we have the present Ship of
	Theseus which has gone through periods of renewal, and a ship that is made
	of variously aged parts of what used to be the Ship of Theseus.

	aspects? </I>

	2) Defining key terms in a question usually facilitates finding the answer.
	This is because most of the times when we argue, we are merely arguing over
	the vague definitions of terms without ever explicitly agreeing on one. How
