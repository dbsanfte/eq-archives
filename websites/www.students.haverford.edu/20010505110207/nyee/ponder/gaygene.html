<p> <span class="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Biological 
  evidence for homosexuality made front page news a couple of years ago and they 
  still do. Critiques of flaws in these studies, on the other hand, are almost 
  never heard of. Two of the most widespread studies will be examined briefly.</span></p>
<p><span class="text"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Simon Levay 
  compared a certain group of neurons in the hypothalamus structure between cadavers 
  who were alleged homosexuals and heterosexuals. He theorized that bigger neurons 
  caused heterosexuality, and the media claimed that his evidence supported his 
  claim. One of the problems the public did not hear about is that 17% (6 out 
  of 35) of his cadavers contradicted his theory. Secondly, no scientist has ever 
  claimed that the region under study is linked to sexual orientation. Third, 
  Levay's research does not justify a cause and effect relationship between the 
  neuron size and homosexuality. Fourth, we cannot verify the sexual orientations 
  of these cadavers. The fifth is that Levay's methodology is not universally 
  accepted. Some argue that volume or density are more important than mere size. 
  And finally, it has failed the test of replication. In fact, at least one study 
  by Dr. Shwab in The Netherlands contradicts it.</span></p>
<p><span class="text"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard 
  Pillard and Michael Bailey interviewed identical twins in an attempt to find 
  out whether homosexuality was genetic. They found that 52% of identical twins, 
  22% of fraternal twins, 11% of adoptive brothers, and 9% of non-twin brothers 
  were homosexual. The media were quick to point out that as genetic similarity 
  increased, so did the probability of both being homosexual, and thus homosexuality 
  was genetic. The media was silent with regards to the shallowness of this explanation. 
  Identical twins share all their genes, and if homosexuality were genetic, then 
  we would expect 100% of identical twins to be homosexual. Because this is not 
  the case, it makes more sense to say that environmental, not biological, factors 
  cause homosexuality. Secondly, the use of identical twins raised together do 
  not tease apart the nurture vs nature debate, instead the methodology merely 
  confounded the issue more. Thirdly, the subjects were recruited through publications 
  that catered exclusively to homosexuals, and thus do not represent an accurate 
  sample of the whole population.</span></p>
<p><span class="text"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gay rights 
  activists seem to be trying to prove the acceptability of homosexuality through 
  a gay gene, while Christian theologians seem to be trying to say that if a gay 
  gene is not found then homosexuality is immoral. In this crossfire of whether 
  homosexuality is genetic, I contend that our finding of a gay gene will not 
  really get us anywhere in the debate. </span></p>
<p><span class="text"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is 
  because we know that bad things can be genetic. For example, the mental retardation 
  that accompanies Down Syndrome is caused by a genetic defect. So is cystic fibrosis 
  that causes problems in human respiration. Accompanied by other abnormalities 
  such as color-blindness or Klein-Felters, the list of genetically caused defects 
  is not short. Even if a gay gene were found, this would not grant homosexuality 
  moral or social acceptability because it could still be regarded as a defect 
  or an abnormality. </span></p>
<p><span class="text"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some homosexuals 
  also feel that finding a gay gene might diminish prevalent homophobia. This 
  is also a na&iuml;ve view. Racism has not diminished because we know that blackness 
  or whiteness is genetic. Sexism exists even though we know that sex is genetic. 
  </span></p>
<p><span class="text"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since finding 
  a gay gene will neither make homosexuality morally or socially acceptable nor 
  will it diminish homophobia, it is clearly the wrong place to be looking. The 
  gay gene debate and arguments over whether it is genetic or not are superfluous 
  and can have no real impact on the important aspects of the discussion of whether 
  homosexuality should be acceptable.</span></p>
<p><span class="text"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another 
  line of attempt at the problem is to argue that humans have the right to choose 
  how they live, and even if homosexuality is not genetic, it should be morally 
  acceptable to accept people's choices. However, not all choices are good or 
  moral choices. Getting a haircut is a choice. Getting a tattoo is a choice, 
  but so is getting an abortion. So is the choice to go to the bar every night 
  and getting trashed. So is the choice to smoke crack each night to get by with 
  life. Two people who engage in sado-masochistic behavior willingly are acting 
  out their choices, but they and the drunk and drug addict may require psychological 
  attention which would be denied to their well-being if outsiders did not intervene. 
  The argument that homosexuality is a choice does not answer the serious accusation 
  that homosexuals are people who need psychological counselling.</span></p>
<p><span class="text"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the 
  arguments for accepting homosexuality seem weak, so are the arguments for branding 
  homosexuality as immoral or wrong.</span></p>
<p><span class="text"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main 
  argument is usually based on the unnaturalness of homosexuality. Some claim 
  that because homosexuality is unnatural, therefore it is wrong. This argument 
  is even more na&iuml;ve then the view that finding a gay gene will diminish 
  homophobia. Consider the everyday artifact - a pair of eyeglasses. Eyeglasses 
  do not appear in nature and are man-made. According to the argument, wearing 
  eyeglasses is immoral and wrong because it is unnatural. So is car-driving, 
  house-painting and even doing algebra because it does not appear anywhere else 
  in the natural animal kingdom. Proponents of this type of argument fail to see 
  whatever a human being does must be natural because human beings themselves 
  are part of nature and thus natural. For a human being to do something unnatural, 
  he must be unnatural himself, which is an odd position to take because this 
  would mean that nature contains unnaturalness. </span></p>
<p><span class="text"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sibling 
  argument to the unnaturalness argument is the disgust argument. Surely something 
  as disturbing as homosexual intercourse must be wrong. However, many people 
  are also disturbed by the gore of seeing open heart surgery. Does this make 
  it immoral and wrong? Thus both these arguments are untenable ones logically. 
  </span></p>
<p><span class="text"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A more 
  sophisticated argument is that homosexuality uproots society's most cherished 
  and valued element of the family. Proponents of this view forget perhaps that 
  the American heterosexual family faces a 50% chance of divorce that has long 
  term effects on all parties involved, particularly young children. Homosexual 
  couples have a much, much lower divorce rate in comparison and thus in a way 
  cause less disruption to our most cherished social element the family. Proponents 
  of this view also forget that democracy could also have been argued to uproot 
  society's most cherished and valued element of the royalty and dictatorship 
  and banned as immoral.</span></p>
<p><span class="text"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the 
  question is neither &quot;Is it genetic?&quot; nor &quot;Is it a choice?&quot;, 
  neither &quot;Isn't it unnatural?&quot; nor &quot;Isn't it disgusting?&quot;, 
  or even &quot;Will it uproot society's values?&quot;. So, what is the right 
  question then? What makes something morally acceptable or unacceptable?</span></p>
<p><span class="text"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part of 
  the problem here is that the world is inherently amoral, and we become unsettled 
  by the thought that something can be neither because we often forget that that 
  is how the world is. The questions asked above all try to paint in broad strokes 
  that answer to generalities instead of specificities, and it is hard to find 
  absolutes in such broad generalities. People are using the easy way out:</span></p>
<p><span class="text">1) Something that is genetically caused is acceptable.<br>
  2) Homosexuality is acceptable because gay genes exist.</span></p>
<p><span class="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it is 
  seldom that such general statements as (1) are absolutely true. There are exceptions. 
  And when people go through all the generalities they know and every one of them 
  fails their plight, they get confused, as we have by our questions above. </span></p>
<p><span class="text"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If homosexuality 
  is a moral question, then it deserves to be questioned specifically, and very 
  few people have. Most arguments for or against it are tied up with some &quot;If..then&quot; 
  generality or analogy. People trying to show the moral acceptability or unacceptability 
  of homosexuality need to focus more on the specifics. </span></p>
<p><span class="text"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is 
  the more provoking possibility that homosexuality does not deserve moral standing, 
  in the sense that it is absurd to talk about it in moral terms because it is 
  neither. This is also the case with most preferences or behaviors. We do not 
  think of eating one flavor versus another flavor of ice-cream as being morally 
  unacceptable. Are we making a problem where none exists? In the world, there 
  are moral questions and there are non-moral questions. Does homosexuality belong 
  to the latter?<br>
