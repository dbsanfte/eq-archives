  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mandatory organ donation at 
  death would certainly cause a public uproar. Side-stepping the moral question 
  of whether dead people have rights, let's take a different perspective to this 
  scenario.</p>
<p class="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At one level, 
  we seem to resist the idea because it is a mandatory theft for the greater good. 
  We don't like the idea that we have to give something up without a choice. But 
  realistically speaking, taxation is both these things. More important and relevant 
  to this scenario is the reality of death taxes. Our estates are taxed when we 
  die. </p>
<p class="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now here is a 
  very amazing pair of thoughts. It is without doubt that the taxable estate is 
  of some value, whereas the organs of a dead person are of no value to his immediate 
  family (unless they sell them, but most don't). Yet the former is accepted without 
  any overt resentment, and the suggestion of the latter would cause an uproar. 
  It seems absurd that we would give something of value away willingly, and fight 
  to keep something that is useless. </p>
<p class="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But consider a 
  scenario where the government gave you the choice between the two. Either your 
  estate will be taxed or some of your organs may be taken. Would most people 
  still choose to be taxed? Is it the case that nothing in life certain but death 
  and taxes? </p>
