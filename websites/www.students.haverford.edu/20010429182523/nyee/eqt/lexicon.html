              spawned. </p>
            <p class="normal"><b class="text">Zone</b> - Originally referred to 
              the different areas of the world which due to different graphic 
              sets involves temporary pauses as the game loads the new graphic 
              set. This term has also come to refer to the boundary itself, as 
              well as a verb, meaning to escape by crossing zones.</p>
            <hr>
            <span class="normal">To play EverQuest, the game software has to be 
            bought and a monthly connection fee has to be paid for <b class="text">server</b> 
            access. Players create their characters on one of the available servers. 
            Each player can have up to 8 characters on each server. Once created, 
            characters usually cannot be transferred from one server to another. 
            A different copy of the game world resides on each server, and characters 
            from different servers cannot interact with each other. The servers 
            are like parallel universes, where the world and game mechanics are 
            the same, but the people, economy and culture is different. </span> 
            <p class="normal"><b class="text">Characters</b> can be created from 
              13 <b class="text">races</b> and 14<b class="text"> classes</b>. 
              Each race has different advantages or disadvantages, such as infravision 
              or low stamina. Examples of races are Barbarian, Wood Elf, Ogre, 
              and Human. Classes are occupational niches that can be chosen, and 
              different races have different class options. Each class has its 
              own set of skills and abilities, as well as starting attributes. 
              Examples of classes are Warrior, Druid, Wizard, and Rogue. Each 
              character has a set of 7 <b class="text">attributes</b> that determine 
              its basic abilities. Examples are Strength, Dexterity, Wisdom, and 
              Charisma. Attributes are numeric and each race/class combination 
              starts with a base assignment of each attribute and given 25-30 
              bonus points to distribute among them during the character creation 
              process. Character <b class="text">gender</b> is also an available 
              choice, and has no bearing on internal game mechanics apart from 
              making the character visually different. </p>
            <p class="normal">The <b>world</b> of Norrath is enormous and is divided 
              into<b class="text"> zones</b> that vary from the snowy peaks of 
              Everfrost, to the desert of Ro, to the swamps of Innothule. The 
              world is separated into 3 main continents (5 with the expansions), 
              and a journey from one end of the world to the other is an arduous 
              trek. Characters begin at different parts of the world depending 
              on their race. Each zone is populated with a different collection 
              of computer-generated creatures, known as<b class="text"> mobs</b>. 
              The underlying thrust of the game lies in killing mobs to gain <b class="text">experience</b> 
              so that the<b class="text"> level</b> of your character can increase. 
              As you increase in level, you are able to kill more powerful mobs, 
              get more money and items off their corpses (known as loot), and 
              buy better items, so that you can kill even more powerful mobs and 
              get more experience. As mobs are killed, they are regenerated after 
              predetermined intervals at predefined locations, known as <b class="text">spawning</b> 
              and spawning sites respectively. </p>
            <p class="normal">Attaining<b class="text"> levels</b> gets exponentially 
              more difficult and takes an exponentially larger amount of time. 
              Different race/class combinations use different strategies in killing 
              mobs and gaining levels, and the game is easier (or harder) at certain 
              stages of character development for certain race/class combination 
              than for others. As characters increase in level, it becomes increasingly 
              more difficult to adventure and kill higher level mobs alone. Characters 
              often band together to form <b class="text">groups</b> where the 
              characters, of different races and classes, complement each other. 
              Teamwork and grouping were designed to play an important role in 
              the game as it usually becomes tedious to work alone, known as <b class="text">soloing</b>. 
            </p>
            <p class="normal"><b>Communication</b> in the game takes place in 
              a chat panel at the bottom of the screen. Different modes of communication 
              are available, and the text is displayed in different colors depending 
              on the mode. The basic modes are <b class="text">Say, Shout and 
              Tell</b>. Saying something allows anyone in the immediate area to 
              see it displayed on their screen. Shouting something allows everyone 
              in the immediate zone to see it. Telling someone only allows the 
              person you tell to see it. The other modes include <b class="text">Auction, 
              Out Of Character, Yell</b>, and Guild functions. Auction is a specific 
              channel that players can use to trade items, and is broadcasted 
              through the zone. OOC is for out of character talk and is also broadcasted 
              through the zone. Yelling (by typing &quot;/y&quot;) indicates to 
              people in the immediate area that you need help and tells them where 
              you are relative to them. Guild functions allow guild members to 
              communicate with each other. </p>
            <p class="normal"><b class="text">Guilds</b> are player creations 
              that need to go through a petition and approval process. Any player 
              can try to start a guild. A guild is essentially a club or social 
              group that connects characters together. A guild can have any name 
              that is not already being used. The petitioner needs to get 10 other 
              characters who are willing to approve his or her guild. Then the 
              guild is petitioned in EverQuest's chat server, and after approval 
              is made part of the game on that server. All guild members have 
              their guild names displayed next to their own names in the game. 
              Guilds allow guild members to communicate with one another using 
              the guild chat channel, allow for a sense of group membership, and 
              allow coordination of larger-scale events in EverQuest such as zone 
              raids. </p>
            <p class="normal">When players <b class="text">log on</b> to play 
              the game, their characters start wherever they last left off. To 
              <b class="text">log off</b> the game, a character must sit down 
              and set up camp. Setting up camp takes 30 seconds. This is done 
              mainly so people would not be able to log off to end a hard battle. 
              Characters can <b class="text">die</b> in the game. When a character 
              dies, the character is sent back to his starting point, known as 
              bind point, which can be changed using spells. The character's equipment 
              and possessions are all left on a corpse where the character died. 
              To get his or her possessions back, a character must retrieve his 
              or her own <b class="text">corpse</b>, known as a corpse run. Corpses 
              <b class="text">decay</b> depending on the character's level, and 
              if a corpse is not retrieved before it decays, it is lost forever. 
              Some parts of the world prevent corpse retrieval altogether such 
              as dying in a lava pool in Lavastorm. </p>
            <p class="normal">Although most of the game mechanics are related 
              to combat, there are aspects of the game that have nothing to do 
              with combat. Characters can develop and train in<b class="text"> 
              trade skills</b> apart from their combat skills. At high enough 
              skill levels, characters can craft magical jewelry, brew potions, 
              or smith banded armor that is otherwise not available in the game. 
              Many characters supplement their income through these trade skills.</p>
