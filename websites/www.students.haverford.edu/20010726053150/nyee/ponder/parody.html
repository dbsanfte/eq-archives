      <p> <span class="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It 
        is not only a selfish act for animal rights activists to become vegetarians, 
        it is an act of contradicting beliefs. Why are they willing to grant animals 
        moral standing, but fail to see that every living organism is linked to 
        each other in an evolutionary chain, including the plant kingdom which 
        they consider lowly and expendable. How can they use a human's subjective 
        judgment of sentience to condemn plants as being unintelligent and unemotional? 
        Are we gods who have the power to exclude plants from the moral community? 
        No, we are merely biased and selfish minds who think that only those life 
        forms that resemble us can have moral status. What an act of egocentric 
        specieism! And to think that animal rights activists, who often use the 
        term to condemn others, would know better. </span></p>
      <p><span class="text"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Animal 
        rights activists show us documentaries of brutal animal breeding techniques: 
        immobilized calves fed a liquid diet, geese force-fed until their legs 
        cannot hold their weight, or crowded chicken cages in a dark room. But 
        where are the pictures and slides of the inhumanity being waged against 
        the plant populace: the scenes of sudden and forceful decapitation with 
        a cold, mindless scyth, of the repeated beatings to remove husks, or of 
        the immediate death of roasting live peanuts. We have been desensitized 
        by mass industrialization and we have blinded ourselves to their constant 
        pain and torment. </span></p>
      <p><span class="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
        animal rights activists who become vegetarians commit an even greater 
        crime because in each meal they mutilate and massacre more lives than 
        a meat-eater would. If they consider it immoral to terminate the lives 
        of entire animal families in cold blood, why do they render this fate 
        onto our plant brethren? If they are appalled and enraged by the deranged 
        sociopath who rapes and mutilates his victims, why do they allow the slaughter 
        and disembowelment of peas to continue? If they condemn any kind of eugenics 
        program, why do they continue to consume plants breeded for superiority? 
        And how can they tolerate the enslavement of plants to a life where they 
        are breeded to be slaughtered? They are not only hypocrites, but callous 
        and unthinking mass murderers.</span></p>
      <p><span class="text"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And 
        sometimes they are brazen enough to ask others whether they would go to 
        the slaughter-house to kill their own cow. Who are they to ask the question? 
        They should be confronted with whether they would go to a farm to harvest 
        their own rice or soy beans. If they are unwilling to harvest their own 
        crops, then they should not feed on them. If they are willing to, then 
        they will see how cold and desensitized they have become. They will see 
        that willingness has nothing to do with morality.</span></p>
      <p><span class="text"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They 
        forget that at least 100 soy bean souls are decapitated and boiled to 
        death in semi-consciousness to make one small square of tofu. What a great 
        sin it is to indulge in the luxury of tofu at the cost of so many innocent 
        lives. Who are they to condemn fur-coats when they themselves butcher 
        tenfold the number of lives to satisfy their materialistic needs? We must 
        not allow this treachery and hypocrisy to go on. We must do unto these 
        callous minds what they do unto others. We must take the initiative and 
        deface their tofu with spray paint.</span></p>
      <p><span class="text"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It 
        is time that we awaken these misled minds to see what true moral status 
        plants have and to guide them to follow the correct path to save our planet. 
        It is obvious that our continued existence will only mean the meaningless 
        sacrifice of many other defenseless lives. It is time we end this compromised 
        hypocrisy called animal rights activism. It is time we do the most that 
        we can as soon as possible. It is time when we must give up our survival 
        so that more lives may survive without us. Remember, all life is equal. 
        Rest in peace.</span></p>
