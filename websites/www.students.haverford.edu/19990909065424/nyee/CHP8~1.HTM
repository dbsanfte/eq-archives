      <TD VALIGN=top>It takes a certain amount of arrogance for someone to claim
	they know what the purpose of life is. A watch will never understand why
	it is ticking. A computer will never be able to think what it has not been
	programmed to think. Why should we have the luxury of being able to figure
	out this ultimate question? This question is connected to all the questions
	we've dealt with up to this point: nature of reality, existence of god,
	foundation and method of knowledge, basis of morality and many others. I
	will not prescribe a purpose of life here, but instead let us explore the
	possibilities and note what is rational and what is not.
	<P>
	<A NAME=heaven></A>We have explored heaven and hell before briefly. Occam's
	Razor is directly opposed to imaginary afterlife abodes as well as omnipotent
	or omniscient forces. Let us dwell on this topic for a little longer.
	Christianity holds that all those who have done good in their life will ascend
	to heaven, while those who have accumulated too much sins will descend to
	hell. Now the definition of omniscience implies that everything that can
	be known is known, including events that will occur in the past or future.
	So the omniscient god that Christianity postulates certainly knows each
	individual's fate before it occurs, including their actions and thoughts.
	Thus whether a person sins or not is determined before he is born because
	god knows everything. In other words, god punishes people who had no control
	over their actions. So if you will go to hell, you will go to hell no matter
	what you do.
	<P>
	<A NAME=fate></A>Let us take a step back and look at this another way. We
	have already discussed (in a previous end chapter question) that the existence
	of fate, the knowledge of fate, and the ability to change fate cannot all
	coexist at the same time. If fate exists, then we can know fate but cannot
	change it, and the Christian god is a valid hypothesis. If we have free will
	however, then we can change fate and fate does not exist, nor can god, unless
	you want to postulate a god who is not omniscient. So either the Christian
	god exists, and we have no free will, or we have free will, and the Christian
	god does not exist.
	<P>
	We will now leave Christianity behind not with a conclusion that it is wrong,
	but with the conclusion that the theory is very thin and confused.
	<P>
	Theories provided by religion generally focus on an ultimate goal that we
	only reach once we are dead, or an ultimate punishment that we will receive
	if we don't do enough of something. It is remarkable how clever these religions
	are since these theories can never be proved and people feel safe in believing
	in them just in case. Of course, it is natural that only clever religions
	are left behind since no one would believe in ones where you could empirically
	prove them wrong.
	<P>
	<A NAME=Tao></A>But what else is there once you throw out the religions?
	There are several things left. You could believe that purpose exists in the
	moment and that meaning exists only in the present moment, so you should
	make the best out of it. This view is very close to the Taoist and Zen way
	of looking at the world. It is also inspiring in a strange way. Most of us
	cling to our past experiences, worry about the future or are bound by our
	memories. By letting these go, we can live as we really are and perform with
	all our potential.
	<P>
	<A NAME=Reductionists></A>Now reductionists hold that the purpose of our
	lives is to make more babies. It is not a bad theory because at least it
	is empirically true. The only parts of us that physically carry on into the
	next generation are our offspring. The more we can make, the more of "us"
	there will be in the future. At the extreme, it is our genes that are trying
	to maximize themselves and not the individual. The difference is that the
	gene exists across relatives, so the sacrifice of an individual for the greater
	good is possible and indeed necessary. Consider drone ants living in nests
	who are sterile and work for the good of the queen ant who makes more babies,
	or squirrels who give alarm calls to benefit close-by relatives and so on.
	We will focus on this more in the next chapter on biology.
	<P>
	<A NAME=Nihilism></A>Now, all throughout the above, we have been making a
	very implicit assumption that we should have answered first. The assumption
	we've been making is that a purpose must exist. But Occam's Razor would claim
	that it doesn't. Indeed, there would be no contradiction if a purpose did
	not exist. Under this view, it is an absurd question to ask which culture
	has the better purpose of life or whether there can be many different purposes.
	When people extend this view of purposelessness to amorality, it is known
	as nihilism. The view that everything is meaningless, and no good or evil
	exists. Nihilism would like to have us think that we are merely accidental
	specks of cosmic dust that have a fleeting existence in this meaningless
	universe. It is a very bleak view of life.
	<P>
	<A NAME=standards></A>This would seem appealing to Occam's Razor had we not
	shown that standards exist in this world. These standards come from our logic
	and reason. It is true that the universe is meaningless and empty, but when
	you have chaos tinkering in eternity something is bound to happen, and we
	did, as well as logic. Both logic and life are fleeting apparitions in this
	corner of the universe, but for a moment in eternity, we are lucky enough
	to be able to hold onto something that we know is true.
	<P>
	Suddenly, it is much less important whether there is a universal purpose
	because we have a standard for deciding what is true or false. With this
	standard, we can create logical and practical standards. From these foundational
	stepping stones, meaning can be derived because the ability to step closer
	to the truth is a privileged award.
	<P>
	And when you know something, and you know that it is for certain as long
	as you live (because if the world suddenly became illogical, we would all
	die), you will never look at life in the same way again.
