      <TD VALIGN=top>Philosophy is traditionally divided into three main fields:
	<P>
	<B>Metaphysics</B>
	<P>
	The field of metaphysics is concerned with the nature of reality. Metaphysical
	questions ask what is real and what isn't real. This may seem like a naive
	question, but it brings up many thorny issues. For example, if we can only
	perceive the world through our mind, how do we know that all reality does
	not start there? Is reality made of mental constructs or is it made of physical
	objects? Does an external reality, separate from our consciousness, exist?
	This last question led several past philosophers to consider the nature of
	god?
	<P>
	Should dreams be considered to be real? How about hallucinations? Apart from
	wondering what is real and what isn't, metaphysics also asks us about the
	true nature of objects. What constitutes a chair? Several years ago, an artist
	used high power air vents coming from the ground that were strong enough
	to support a man in a sitting position. He labelled it "Chair". Is this really
	a chair? <A NAME=1></A><A HREF="#Linked Questions">(1)</A>
	<P>
	<B>Epistemology</B>
	<P>
	It seems counterintuitive to ask people how they know an apple in front of
	them actually exists. They would probably find the question absurd. This
	question, however, turns out to be exceedingly difficult to answer.
	<P>
	Epistemology deals with how we gain knowledge of the world around us, and
	whether we really know anything at all. Are there things that we know for
	certain, or is it the case that we cannot be sure of anything at all? Is
	knowledge something stable and constant, or does it change depending on culture
	and context?
	<P>
	An important question is whether objective knowledge is possible, by which
	we mean knowledge which is not biased, subjective or that can be changed
	easily under different interpretations.
	<A NAME=2></A><A HREF="#Linked Questions">(2)</A>
	<P>
	<B>Ethics</B>
	<P>
	After thinking about our sources of knowledge, we can turn to Ethics, which
	asks us how we know what is right and what is wrong? Is it even possible
	to know what values or morals are more correct?
	<P>
	Ethics questions why we believe certain things are right, while others are
	wrong, and whether it is possible that contrary actions can be both right
	at the same time. Is abortion or capital punishment moral? Like epistemology,
	it asks whether such things as universal rights exist, or whether such lofty
	concepts are manmade illusions.
	<P>
	The main question is whether one method of living or choosing is more righteous
	than another. Should we be selfish, or generous? Should we make rules and
	follow them, or should we judge according to the situation? Is consequence
	or motive more important in determining guilt?

	1) As an exercise, try to define the necessary properties that an object
	must have for it to be called a chair and not something else.
	<A HREF="#1">Back</A>
	<P>
	2) Which argument is easier to defend: that nothing can be known for certain,
	or that some things can be known for certain?&nbsp;<A HREF="#2">Back</A>
	<P>
	3) In a society, which people decide what is right and what is wrong? What
	method do they use? <A HREF="#3">Back</A>
