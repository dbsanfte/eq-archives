  <p align="justify">First of all, I'd like to thank the 232 people who responded 
    to my questionnaire. It felt a little harder to get people to respond to a 
    study where their interests were not the primarily element under investigation. 
    I had to advertise the questionnaire in more places, and on the way learned 
    a little more about what works and what doesn't in terms of this kind of advertising. 
    In any case, I'm very happy with the number of responses I got and it reassured 
    me that 20-30 minutes of knowledgeable advertising on the Web can get you 
    over 200 responses consistently.</p>
  <p align="justify">Like the <a href="http://www.students.haverford.edu/nyee/rpg/home.html">RPG 
    study</a>, I started out wanting to make a presentation that would be easy 
    to understand even for people who had never touched psychology or statistics. 
    As I began writing up the results though, I realized that these constellations 
    of small, yet significant, correlations make it hard to make satisfying statements 
    that are specific or of high certainty. So in the end, I added sections that 
    simplified matters and wrote up a sample reading that demonstrates how this 
    might work out. People who have studied psychology or statistics will probably 
    share the same sense of mixed excitement and frustration as I had in performing 
    the data analysis.</p>
  <p align="justify">If you are not acquainted with psychology or statistics,
  read the Introduction and Method. Then skim the Results and go on to the
  Sample Reading. After the Sample Reading, you will have a much better idea of
  what the numbers in the Results page mean. </p>
