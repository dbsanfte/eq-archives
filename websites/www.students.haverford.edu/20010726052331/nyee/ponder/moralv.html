      <p class="text">Moral vegetarians are vegetarians who do not eat meat for 
        ethical concerns. This is in contrast to health vegetarians who do not 
        eat meat for health reasons. The two clearly can overlap. The thought 
        experiments here are designed specifically for the moral vegetarian in 
        mind.</p>
      <p class="text">1) If we could breed or genetically engineer a species of 
        cow that had no brain or functioning central nervous system, would moral 
        vegetarians consider it acceptable to eat this cow&#146;s meat?</p>
      <p class="text">2) If we could breed or genetically engineer a species of 
        mushrooms that had a mottled pattern on its shell that resembled a smiley 
        face, but which turned into a sad face when about to be eaten, would moral 
        vegetarians consider it acceptable to eat this kind of mushroom?</p>
      <p class="text">3) If a certain kind of beans evolved to spell the words 
        &#147;Eat Me&#148; on it, would moral vegetarians consider it acceptable 
        to eat this kind of mushroom?</p>
      <p class="text">4) If a certain kind of pig evolved to spell the words &#147;Eat 
        Me&#148; on it, would moral vegetarians consider it acceptable to eat 
        this kind of pig?</p>
      <p class="text">5) If a species of masochistic chickens were found that 
        kept trying to cause each other pain in natural settings and seemed to 
        enjoy it, would it be okay to slaughter them?</p>
      <p class="text">6) If beans and all other kinds of vegetables evolved to 
        spell &#147;Don&#146;t Eat Me&#148; on them, would moral vegetarians consider 
        it acceptable to eat vegetables?</p>
      <p class="text">7) If the words in above scenarios were only in Chinese, 
        would their decisions change?</p>
      <p class="text">8) If the words in above scenarios were in a language of 
        mottled spots that no one could understand, would their decisions change?</p>
