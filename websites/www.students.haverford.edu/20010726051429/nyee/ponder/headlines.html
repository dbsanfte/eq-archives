      <p class="text"><b>Student Group Labeled Racist </b></p>
      <p class="text">The administration of a local liberal arts college has been 
        inundated for a week by the phone calls, emails and letters of support 
        and complaint of a newly-founded student group. The student group, known 
        as the White Students League, was founded last week by sophomores Rick 
        Walsh and Andy Peterson. </p>
      <p class="text">According to Walsh, the group was founded because he felt 
        that &quot;students at liberal arts colleges are being made to feel that 
        white is not a culture&quot;. Peterson added that &quot;just because someone 
        is white doesn't mean he cannot add to the diversity of a college or society&quot;. 
        Both felt that the word &quot;diversity&quot; at liberal arts colleges 
        in the US had come to exclude whites, as if being white meant an utter 
        lack of cultural or ethnic background.</p>
      <p class="text">The founder of the Black Students League, Steven Morris, 
        has coordinated a protest against the White Students League which he labels 
        as a &quot;racist group that bears an unmistakable resemblance to the 
        Ku Klux Klan&quot;. Another member of the Black Students League commented 
        that &quot;it was a form of reverse-reverse-discrimination&quot;. One 
        student, whose race she wanted to keep undisclosed, remarked that &quot;to 
        claim reverse-reverse-discrimination is occurring is tantamount to claiming 
        that reverse-discrimination was happening. But hey - what's new?&quot;.</p>
      <p class="text">Kay Suffield, a senior at the local liberal arts college, 
        commented that &quot;You can get through college here without taking one 
        class on Western history or culture. But somehow, you have to take a course 
        on minority history or literature or some course under the guise of a 
        social justice requirement, which is really the same thing, except in 
        the latter case the professors feel like they have a right to make you 
        feel guilty for something you didn't do yourself. It really makes no sense.&quot;

      <p class="text" align="left"><b>Born to be Lazy</b></p>
      <p class="text">Over the past year, a discovery by two American scientists 
        has caused sweeping changes in the American education system. Gail Flannagan, 
        one of the scientists, explains that &quot;It's not that we've found a 
        laziness gene, but we have isolated a cluster of interacting genes that 
        together moderate motivation in human beings.&quot; Paul Moss elaborates 
        that &quot;this cluster of genes influences how likely someone is to set 
        goals and complete projects without procrastinating.&quot;</p>
      <p class="text">Parents of children diagnosed with Lack of Motivation Disorder 
        (LMD) have petitioned schools to make sweeping changes to accommodate 
        students with LMD. These parental committees are pushing for grade handicaps, 
        untimed testing, and scholarship quotas for students with LMD. Debra Cesara, 
        mother of a child diagnosed with LMD, commented that &quot;schools should 
        not discriminate against children who are born with this handicap. They 
        should try to do everything they can to compensate them.&quot; Many school 
        boards across the nation have already adopted policies such as the ones 
        suggested by the parental committees.</p>
      <p class="text">Brighton College was the first private college in the nation 
        to adopt LMD policies. Chris Thompson, Provost of Brighton College, commented 
        that they &quot;do not discriminate students on the basis of gender, ethnicity, 
        or sexual orientation, and there is no reason why we should discriminate 
        against students who are born with something they cannot change.&quot; 
        Under a new quota system that will take effect during the next admission 
        process, 10% of the slots for the incoming freshmen class will be available 
        only to students with diagnosed LMD.</p>
      <p class="text">Students at Brighton College rejoiced at the College's decision 
        to adopt these policies. Ian Donovan, a senior at Brighton College, said 
        that he was &quot;glad to be at a college liberal and open-minded enough 
        to accept individuals with LMD without prejudice.&quot; Amy Paslow, another 
        senior, concurred and added that &quot;it is clearly wrong for students 
        with LMD to get lower grades just because they have LMD.&quot;</p>

      <p class="text"><b>Who's Sweating?</b></p>
      <p class="text">Last semester, the student group Students Against Sweat-Shops 
        (SASS) initiated a campaign to generate letters to be sent to clothing 
        companies operating sweatshops in developing countries. Founder of SASS, 
        Elizabeth Yarning, spoke at a campus-wide broadcast and said that &quot;it 
        is unbelievable that brand name companies are operating sweatshops in 
        these countries. It is a shame to the nation. They must be stopped.&quot;</p>
      <p class="text">Letters were not only sent to these brand name companies, 
        they were also sent to several factories in Vietnam where SASS claimed 
        the workers &quot;were often women and were working under atrocious conditions.&quot; 
        These &quot;letters of sympathy&quot; were sent to the workers in these 
        sweatshops.</p>
      <p class="text">Overseas reporter, Vylinh Nguyen, visited these factories 
        to gather the reactions of workers. One worker said that she &quot;thought 
        it was a joke at first. But then when the letters kept coming in, we got 
        really angry and scared.&quot; Other workers expressed the same sentiments. 
        Another worker commented that she &quot;was really afraid they would shut 
        the factory down because of the letters. I tried really hard to get a 
        job here. If they shut down the factory, where will I get a job to feed 
        my family?&quot; Her sister asked &quot;Do these Americans want me to 
        become a prostitute to feed my family?&quot;</p>
      <p class="text">The factory manager, who wanted to remain anonymous, commented 
        that &quot;Americans exaggerate the working conditions and make up names 
        such as 'sweatshop' so they can campaign to shut these factories. But 
        it's all really to make themselves feel better. These American liberal 
        arts college students really enjoy fantasies of 'saving' less fortunate 
        people.&quot; </p>
      <p class="text">Nguyen asked local workers what they would like the students 
        group SASS to know. Most workers replied, &quot;Please stop writing letters. 
        We need this job. If the working conditions were that bad, would we be 
        here in the first place?&quot; One worker calmly remarked, &quot;I'm not 
        sweating. Are you?&quot;</p>

      <p class="text"><b>Color-Blind Artists Liberated</b></p>
      <p class="text">Founder of the Color-Blind Artists Coalition (CBAC), Peter 
        Veil, spoke yesterday at a press conference after the National Endowment 
        for the Arts claimed they would fund a 2 million dollar initiative into 
        developing arts programs for children who are color-blind. Veil commented 
        that this program is &quot;one great leap in liberating color-blind people 
        from the prejudices they have had to endure since the creation of art&quot;.</p>
      <p class="text">CBAC vice president, Michael Stokes, argued that &quot;color-blindness 
        is a genetic trait like race or gender. It is absurd, and indeed backwards, 
        for self-proclaimed modernized nations such as the United States to discriminate 
        against those who are born color-blind. We advocate a society that treats 
        men and women equally. We advocate a society where whites and blacks are 
        equal. But where is the society where color-blind artists can compete 
        with their non-color-blind colleagues?&quot;</p>
      <p class="text">As evidence for the discrimination, Veil points to statistics 
        showing that color-blind people are under-represented in the artistic 
        world. At the press conference, he challenged people to name even one 
        color-blind artist. He was met with silence. To this, he shouted out &quot;And 
        you think women and blacks are prejudiced against?&quot;</p>
      <p class="text">Beginning next May, programs across the nation will be funded 
        through the NEA grant and directed specifically to people with diagnosed 
        color-blindness. Color-blind students in middle-schools and high-schools 
        will be allowed to participate in high-tech classes designed to &quot;unleash&quot; 
        their &quot;stunted creativity&quot;. Stokes said that they were trying 
        to &quot;train first-class color-blind artists&quot;. When asked whether 
        children with normal vision would be allowed to take part in these classes, 
        Veil replied &quot;That would be like giving money to the rich. Only greedy 
        bastards would take the money.&quot;</p>
      <p><span class="text">Opticians around the nation have also reported a significant 
        increase in color-vision testing. New tests had to be developed to counter 
        parents coaching their children to incorrectly identify what they saw 
        in the traditional tests. Wendy Tetherstone, an optician in Boston, commented 
        that she had &quot;never seen parents coaching their children to be color-blind&quot;.
