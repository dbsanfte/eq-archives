        Information intuitively seems to necessarily be positive in quantity. 
        Zero information is possible from a source. For example, if we knew something 
        ahead of time at 100% certainty then we would gain no information if it 
        occurred. An illustration of this is a two-headed coin. It has to land 
        heads so we gain no information when it inevitably does. But is negative 
        information possible?&nbsp;</span></p>
      <p class="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        Something that qualifies as negative information means that it is giving 
        us information, but that information causes us to lose information we 
        already had. This seems totally absurd and only possible in worlds where 
        probabilities of events can exceed 100% certainty. But it is not.&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        Consider a computer hard drive that can store a maximum of 100 megabytes 
        of information. Let us say that it is filled with 4 different 25 megabyte 
        files. Now I have a new 5 megabyte file that I need to put on my hard 
        drive, so I delete one of the old files and copy this new one onto my 
        hard drive. In the end, I lost 20 megabytes of information by gaining 
        new information.&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        Let us transition now to a human mind model of what just happened. The 
        human mind has a finite memory. Each particular memory or piece of information 
        we have takes up our memory space. There must come a point when our memory 
        is almost full. But at the same time, our sensory organs and mind are 
        constantly generating new information and this information has to go somewhere. 
        What inevitably must occur is that old information is systematically erased 
        so that there is room for new information. The difference with the hard 
        drive model is that the human mind probably does not need to delete entire 
        memories at a time but only as much as the new information needs to take 
        up, so the net gain is close to zero.</p>
      <p class="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        This is entirely different from the zero information case however, because 
        we did gain new information that we could not have predicted beforehand, 
        and yet this new piece of information caused us to lose previously stored 
        information. This new information then is actually negative information.</p>
