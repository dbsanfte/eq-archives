      <p> <span class="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 
        English, cows become beef or steak once they have been prepared and served 
        on a plate. In the same way, sheep become mutton, pigs become pork or 
        ham, and deer become venison. This is not the case for all animals. It 
        seems only to apply to large mammals. All fish, fowl, and small mammals 
        keep their original names. Salmon is salmon, chicken stays chicken, and 
        rabbit is still rabbit. </span></p>
      <p><span class="text"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why 
        do large mammals need to have different names when they have been cooked? 
        One possible reason is because the larger the animal gets, the more difficult 
        it becomes to eat it without thinking about the carcass and its slaughter. 
        To make it psychologically easier to handle this dilemma, romance languages 
        gave these larger mammals different names when they are served on a plate.</span></p>
      <p><span class="text"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 
        all dialects of Chinese however, all animals are referred to by their 
        original names even after they have been cooked. Cow becomes cow-meat, 
        pig becomes pig-meat, and sheep becomes sheep-meat. Why don't the Chinese 
        have alternative names if such a psychological fear exists? One explanation 
        is that Chinese cultures serve meat in a very different way from Western 
        cultures. In most dishes where meat from large mammals is present, it 
        is either shredded (as in rice or noodle dishes) or grounded/minced (as 
        in dumplings or buns). It is often very difficult to tell what meat is 
        being served by merely looking at it. Fish and fowl are often served whole, 
        or in larger, more recognizable pieces as in Western culture. </span></p>
      <p><span class="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, 
        one possible reason why Chinese cultures did not develop alternative labels 
        is because large mammals are prepared in a way that makes it difficult 
        to connect the food to the living animal. Western cultures, on the other 
        hand, usually prepare these larger mammals in fragments significantly 
        larger than in Chinese dishes. They usually come in slabs (such as steak, 
        ham or roast beef), or with bones attached which clearly link it to a 
        once-living animal (such as spare-ribs). In both kinds of cultures however, 
        it seems that fish, fowl and small mammals do not have the qualities that 
        elicit this psychological reaction, and thus do not need to be concealed 
        linguistically or physically.</span></p>
      <p><span class="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two 
        theories have emerged and both have predictive power. The first is that 
        a psychological reaction, which may be fear or disgust, exists which makes 
        it difficult for us to consume large mammals unless they are disguised 
        physically or linguistically. Fish, fowl, and small mammals do not trigger 
        this reaction.</span></p>
      <p><span class="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We 
        would predict that very few or no cultures have alternative names for 
        fish, fowl or small mammals. We would also predict that if a culture has 
        alternative labels for fish, fowl and small mammals, then it also has 
        alternative labels for large mammals. Thus, there should be no culture 
        or language that has an alternative name for fish or fowl, but not for 
        cows or pigs at the same time. </span></p>
      <p><span class="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
        second theory is that one kind of concealment is enough. Thus we would 
        predict that cultures which physically disguise meat from large mammals 
        do not need to disguise it linguistically. And also the other way around. 
        Cultures that linguistically disguise their meat do not need to disguise 
        it physically. </span></p>
      <p><span class="text"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eating 
        utensils must come in the picture somewhere, but they are probably not 
        the cause of concealment. This is because the food must be prepared before 
        you can use utensils to eat it. Cultures probably did not invent eating 
        utensils before there was food. Chopsticks cannot slice slabs of meat 
        into smaller pieces, but this is not why Chinese culture shreds and minces 
        meat from large mammals. This would be backwards thinking. </span></p>
