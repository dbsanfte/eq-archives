      and you will either get an acknowledging smile or a confused frown. Along
      with MOO’s, Magic: The Gathering and EverQuest, Role-Playing Games seem
      to be almost unheard of outside certain circles. It is hard for
      role-players to explain what RPG’s are to non-gamers; and it is even
      harder for non-gamers to understand what the appeal of RPG’s is. It is hard to understand RPG’s without ever
      participating in them because RPG’s are not just
      a game; they are an experience. And the ten-sided die, among other things,
      has come to be symbolic of this collective experience.<o:p>

      My main interest in RPG’s is in its interface with our individual
      personalities. I am interested in finding out how our personalities
      influence how we shape our characters or what we are trying to get out of
      the game. Too often we project our own rationale for enjoying RPG’s onto
      others, and we are unaware that other reasons abound. Why do
      some players consistently choose the same character classes while others
      never choose the same one twice? Why do some players like to role-play
      reflections of themselves while others prefer to role-play opposites? Are
      women attracted to RPG’s for the same reasons that men are? My main
      concerns lie in isolating the personality traits that separate one kind of
      behavior or preference from another. For example, in seeing the
      differences between player-character resemblance, I am interested in
      finding out what personality factors are influencing those differences.<o:p>

      </span>Past studies on RPG’s have mostly focused on identifying how
      gamers differ from non-gamers on certain personality scales. Most of these
      studies have yielded very few differences. It has been shown in at least
      two studies that role-players score higher in factor Q1 <i>(Experimenting;
      liberal; freethinking</i>) on the Cattell 16 personality scale than
      non-gamers (Simo’n, 1987; Carroll,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Carolin, 1989). No other deviations were found in any other factor
      when compared to an average sample. Another study where gamers were
      analyzed in terms of feelings of powerlessness, worthlessness and
      isolation found no significant deviation from a non-gaming sample, except
      in the area of “cultural estrangement”. Cultural estrangement in the
      study was defined as awareness and interest in popular entertainment, and
      gamers were found to score lower than non-gamers. On the other hand, they
      also found that non-gamers reported a higher sense of
      “meaninglessness” than gamers (DeRenard, Manik, 1990). Abeyta and
      Forest (1991) used a questionnaire on gamers and non-gamers measuring
      self-reported criminal behavior. Again, no differences were found except
      that non-gamers were found to score higher on “Psychoticism”, which
      however was not a reliably measured factor. Gamers and scholars familiar with
      why RPG’s gained a negative image in the media in the past 20 years will
      probably understand what the motivation behind these studies were. (A good
      historical account can be found here – </font> <a href="http://www.rpg.net/252/quellen/cardwell/attacks.html"><font color="#FFFFFF">The

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Douse and McDougal (1993) performed a study on a fantasy
      Play-by-Mail game where the gamers were compare to non-gamers and gamers were found to score higher in introversion, lower
      in emphatic concern, and were less feminine and androgynous on the BEM
      Sex-Role scale. But because the sample of gamers in the study were all
      chosen from such a peculiar subset, I do not feel the study is
      representative of RPG gamers in general. I also think that the sample is
      biased in several other ways because computer/email preference is
      confounded with role-playing. In particular, people who prefer to socialize
      over email are probably more introverted than an average sample regardless
      of whether they are role-players. Furthermore, Play-by-Mail RPG’s are
      very different from the traditional table-top face-to-face RPG’s.<o:p>

      her paper seems to have
      been written for a Brandeis College Psychology class, never published
      professionally, and is not written in formal APA style, the data that
      Mulcahy found and the ideas she expressed were intriguing and refreshing.
      This was mainly because she was trying to understand differences within
      gamers rather than differences between gamers and non-gamers.<o:p>

      Mulcahy’s
      study consisted mainly of a two-part email survey, where her second survey
      followed up on the most detailed and elaborate responses from the first
      survey. She divided her respondents into male/female and
      introverted/extroverted factors. Altogether she chose 8 final respondents with 2
      in each combination. Mulcahy did not use any statistical
      tool in her analysis and used quotes as her main support.<o:p>

      game play behavior and preferences. The main ones include: gender, age,
      self-image, other personality factors as well as the sense of personal
      growth and the character as self-idealization which carry over from
      Mulcahy’s study.</span></font>
