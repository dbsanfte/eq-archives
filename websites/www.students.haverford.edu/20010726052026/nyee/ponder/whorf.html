      <p> <span class="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Steven 
        Pinker's main goal in The Language Instinct, as the title suggests, was 
        to argue for the innateness of language acquisition. In a chapter titled, 
        &quot;Mentalese&quot;, he contends that words must be built upon word 
        concepts, or what he calls mentalese, and not the other way around. His 
        main opponent in this chapter was very naturally Benjamin Lee Whorf who 
        Pinker claims is the primary proponent of the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis. 
        Reading through his chapter, one cannot help but notice the vehement opposition 
        that Pinker holds against Whorf's ideas. Pinker claims that Whorf's hypothesis 
        and predictions are &quot;wrong, all wrong&quot; (Pinker, pg. 57) and 
        that &quot;the idea that thought is the same thing as language is ... 
        a conventional absurdity&quot; (Pinker, pg. 57). As one continues to read 
        Pinker's chapter, one is inclined to align with his cause and conclude 
        that Whorf was being too subjective and illogical. And yet, after some 
        thought, one might begin to see the shallowness of Whorf's supposed hypothesis 
        and wonder how such a backwards theory might have come to receive so much 
        opposition if it's clearly wrong. One begins to wonder what Whorf really 
        said. </span></p>
      <p><span class="text"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pinker 
        defines the Whorfian hypothesis as having a weaker and stronger version. 
        He defines the stronger version, known as linguistic determinism, as &quot;stating 
        that people's thoughts are determined by categories made available by 
        their language&quot; (Pinker, pg. 57). But Whorf never suggests such in 
        his much quoted book of collected essays, Language, Thought, and Reality. 
        In fact, Whorf defines &quot;grammatical patterns as interpretations of 
        experience&quot; (Whorf, pg. 137). He sees language to be &quot;in some 
        sense a superficial embroidery upon deeper processes of consciousness, 
        which are necessary before communication ..., and which also can, at a 
        pinch, effect communication without language's and without symbolism's 
        aid&quot; (Whorf, pg. 239). Almost unambiguously, here is the mentalese 
        that Pinker was talking about - thoughts that precede and are independent 
        of words. So not only did Whorf anticipate mentalese, but he also clearly 
        realized that language was not the same as thought which Pinker claimed 
        as a conventional absurdity. Whorf goes on to say that language &quot;may 
        generalize down ... to something better - called 'sublinguistic' or 'superlinguistic' 
        - and not altogether unlike ... what we now call 'mental'&quot; (Whorf, 
        pg. 239). </span></p>
      <p><span class="text"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As 
        for the weaker version of the Whorfian hypothesis, known as linguistics 
        relativity, Pinker defines it as &quot;stating that differences among 
        languages cause differences in the thoughts of their speaker&quot; (Pinker, 
        pg. 57). Pinker then pushes this further and suggests that &quot;the implication 
        is heavy: the foundational categories of reality are not 'in' the world 
        but are imposed by one's culture&quot; (Pinker, pg. 57). And yet, Whorf 
        realized that this was not the case and wrote that &quot;there are connections 
        but not correlations or diagnostic correspondences between cultural norms 
        and linguistic patterns&quot; (Whorf, pg. 159). Thus Whorf advocated a 
        connection, not a correlation and certainly not a causality relation between 
        language and cultural norms or cultural thought. </span></p>
      <p><span class="text"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pinker, 
        after setting up a flimsy strawman of Whorf's position, then proceeds 
        to describe how all of Whorf's evidence were either wrong or hoaxes. Pinker 
        first considers how Whorf claims that the Hopi language has &quot;no words, 
        grammatical forms, constructions, or expressions that refer directly to 
        what we call 'time'&quot; (Whorf, pg. 57). This is true, but what Whorf 
        meant was not time in general, but our concept of time. He actually spends 
        a whole chapter discussing the nonlinear properties of the Hopi perception 
        of time. Their aspectual and modal marker system allow them to refer to 
        events without using specific &quot;time elements&quot; and thus they 
        do not need to use tense markers. Whorf does not mean that the Hopi do 
        not understand what time is; he claims that the Hopi do not see time and 
        use tenses the way we do. Pinker interprets this as claiming the former 
        and happily pulls out an example where a native Hopi speaker uses a temporal 
        descriptor to counter Whorf:<br>
        Then indeed, the following day, quite early in the morning at the hour 
        when people pray to the sun, around that time then he woke up the girl 
        again. (Pinker, pg. 63).<br>
        If Pinker had read Whorf closer, however, he would have discovered that 
        Whorf knew this. Whorf, in an analysis of Hopi grammar, wrote that &quot;in 
        Hopi however all phase terms, like 'summer, morning', etc., are not nouns 
        but a kind of adverb&quot; (Whorf, pg. 143). So Pinker thinks that he 
        has countered Whorf when he has merely reproduced what Whorf wrote down 
        more than forty years ago. </span></p>
      <p><span class="text"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pinker 
        also gives a short list (Pinker, pg. 60) of Whorf's Amerindian sentences 
        and criticizes them on two counts. He first claims that the 3 sentence 
        examples were from the Apache language, but that Whorf never studied Apache 
        or had a true Apache informant. While it is true that Whorf never had 
        an Apache informant or studied Apache intensively, the 3 sentences that 
        Pinker produces are not Apache sentences, nor does Whorf label them so 
        in his book. The first two sentences (boat and feast example) are from 
        Nootka (Whorf, pg. 236 and 243 respectively), a language spoken in the 
        Vancouver Islands, and the third sentence (gun example) is in Shawnee 
        (Whorf, pg. 208). It is true however that Whorf studied these two languages. 
        In short, Pinker is barking up the wrong tree. </span></p>
      <p><span class="text"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pinker 
        also criticizes these sentences as being &quot;clumsy, word-for-word translations, 
        designed to make the literal meanings seem as odd as possible&quot; (Pinker, 
        pg. 61). This might be true, but Whorf did not intend for these sentences 
        to be mere examples of Amerindian thought. He was trying to show specific 
        aspects of the language in each example. For example, in the The boat 
        is grounded on the beach example, the Nootka version is &quot;It is on 
        the beach pointwise as an event of canoe motion&quot; (Whorf, pg. 236). 
        Whorf meant for this sentence to demonstrate how Nootka does not use nouns, 
        but rather verbs to express all events. Thus no &quot;boat&quot; is mentioned, 
        only canoe motion that implies boat. In the He invites people to a feast, 
        the Nootka version is &quot;Somebody invites eaters of cooked food&quot; 
        (Whorf, pg. 243), where Whorf tries to demonstrate how the Nootka sentence 
        is not divisible into the subject and predicate, or actor and object, 
        relation that is essential in English. </span></p>
      <p><span class="text"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At 
        the end of this long ranting against Whorf, Pinker tells us &quot;no one 
        is really sure how Whorf came up with his outlandish claims, but his limited, 
        badly analyzed sample of Hopi speech and his long-time leanings towards 
        mysticism must have contributed&quot; (Pinker, pg. 63). Now, although 
        some of Whorf's examples were not entirely correct, such as the Eskimo 
        words for snow, he was never entirely off the mark, and we have shown 
        that many of Pinker's attacks are not valid. But even with the Eskimo 
        words for snow, Whorf only suggested seven different words (pg. 210 and 
        216). Pinker speaks of &quot;limited, badly analyzed samples&quot;, but 
        one has to wonder whether Pinker or Whorf has made the grosser distortion 
        of others. </span></p>
      <p><span class="text"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After 
        one has actually read Whorf's Language, Thought, and Reality, one notices 
        that the better examples mentioned in his book are missing in today's 
        &quot;debate&quot; over the Whorfian hypothesis. Most opponents pick on 
        either how he was wrong with the number of Eskimo words for snow or how 
        the Hopi do have a concept of time, or how mentalese must precede words. 
        Yet Whorf had foreseen most of these problems and had included more detailed 
        analyses as evidence. The most strikingly sustained one is in his comparison 
        between Hopi and English. </span></p>
      <p><span class="text"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whorf 
        begins his comparison at the very basic level of plurality and numeration. 
        In English, plurals can be formed of both concrete and imaginary objects. 
        For example, we can say &quot;three dogs&quot; when there are three dogs 
        in front of us, but we can also say the next &quot;three days&quot; when 
        the extra days are subjective and must be imagined in our minds. When 
        we use &quot;three dogs&quot; however, the dogs we see may not be of the 
        same size, but when we say the next &quot;three days&quot;, the days must 
        be of equal length in our imagination. In a sense, we count &quot;three 
        days&quot; by recycling the one day three times in our imagination. Time, 
        by itself, is a mere subjective &quot;becoming later&quot;, and English 
        speakers objectify it by dividing time into counted quantities, thus a 
        &quot;forward cycling&quot;. Now, one might argue here that this must 
        be the case universally because that is the only way days can be perceived, 
        and that the next &quot;three days&quot; is the same as the last &quot;three 
        days&quot;, one which is concrete and the other imaginary. Yet as Whorf 
        states, &quot;a likeness of cyclicity to aggregates [or objects] is not 
        unmistakably given by experience prior to language, or it would be found 
        in all languages, and it is not&quot; (Whorf, pg. 139). In other words, 
        if our way of perceiving and counting imaginary objects are so much a 
        part of commonsense, then all languages should do the same. If they did 
        not, then our way of thinking is not universally commonsense and implies 
        that our language influences how we perceive imaginary objects such as 
        time. </span></p>
      <p><span class="text"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And 
        this is exactly the case for the Hopi. They can only count concrete nouns, 
        such as dogs, and cannot do so for imaginary nouns. For imaginary nouns, 
        they have to combine the ordinal with singulars. So to say, &quot;They 
        stayed ten days&quot;, the Hopi have to say instead &quot;They left on 
        the eleventh day&quot;. What this does is that it leaves the subjective 
        quality of time intact - things happening &quot;later and later&quot; 
        instead of things happening &quot;in cycles&quot; or after &quot;a certain 
        number of cycles&quot;. Thus, &quot;instead of our linguistically promoted 
        objectification of that datum of consciousness we call 'time', the Hopi 
        language has not laid down any pattern that would cloak the subjective 
        'becoming later' that is the essence of time&quot; (Whorf, pg. 140). </span></p>
      <p><span class="text"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whorf 
        then uses this background as a stepping stone to more complex linguistic 
        rules. He next considers count nouns and mass nouns. English makes a distinction 
        between count nouns and mass nouns. Count nouns are those objects that 
        are discrete and have clear boundaries - dogs, cats, pins, bottles. Mass 
        nouns are those that are continuous or have no clear boundaries - salt, 
        water, clay, dust. To count mass nouns, we need a container word. &quot;Hence 
        the 'lumps, chunks, blocks, pieces,' etc., seem to contain something, 
        a 'stuff', 'substance' or 'matter' that answers to the 'water', 'coffee', 
        or 'flour' in the container formulas&quot; (Whorf, pg. 141). A lot of 
        English is built upon this complementarity of formless item and form. 
        Hopi, however, does not have mass nouns. All nouns are countable. Nouns 
        for water are still indefinite, but do not imply lack of outline or size. 
        Thus, they do not have a need to think of objects as the interplay of 
        formless items and forms. </span></p>
      <p><span class="text"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
        implications of this are more clearly seen in our model of time. Time 
        for us is a mass noun and thus it has to be quantified by container nouns, 
        such as &quot;an hour of time&quot;, &quot;a moment of time&quot;. We 
        cannot say &quot;one time&quot;, or &quot;two times&quot; the way we want 
        it to mean. For us, time is carved into quantities by our &quot;summers, 
        winters, Septembers, and noons.&quot; For the Hopi however, phase terms, 
        such as &quot;morning&quot; are almost like adverbs, not nouns. &quot;Summer&quot; 
        is only when it is hot and dry. Our &quot;It's summer&quot; translates 
        more readily into Hopi as &quot;It's hot and dry right now&quot;. Thus 
        there is no &quot;This summer&quot; in Hopi, only &quot;Summer now&quot;, 
        &quot;Summer recently&quot;. Because they have no form containing a formless 
        item, they have no need to quantify &quot;time&quot; into cycling days 
        or summers. </span></p>
      <p><span class="text"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So 
        for English, it is convenient to separate time into past, present and 
        future because of these subdivisions of time. And to distinguish between 
        these three time frames, we use tense markers. For the Hopi, however, 
        they need only have two - the experienced and the yet to be experienced. 
        What is important to the Hopi is the validity of a sentence and they use 
        validation markers instead of tense markers. A comparison between the 
        two systems is given: </span></p>
      <table width="75%" border="1" cellpadding="5" align="center">
        <tr bgcolor="#666666"> 
          <td><b><span class="text">English (Tense Markers)</span></b></td>
          <td> 
            <p><b><span class="text">Hopi (Validation Markers)</span></b></p>
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr> 
          <td><span class="text">He is running</span></td>
          <td><span class="text">It is fact that (HE, RUN)</span></td>
        </tr>
        <tr> 
          <td><span class="text">He will run</span></td>
          <td><span class="text">It is expected that (HE, RUN) </span></td>
        </tr>
        <tr> 
          <td><span class="text">He runs</span></td>
          <td><span class="text">It is a continual law that (HE, RUN)</span></td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p><span class="text"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, 
        the Hopi are able to describe all phenomena in the world without ever 
        having to recourse to a notion of linear time like English speakers do. 
        Whorf then mentions the effects that such different systems have on the 
        two cultures. The Hopi see tomorrow as a reoccurrence or revisit of today, 
        rather than a new part of a different cycle. This is why they believe 
        in the accumulation of rituals or preparations because they carry into 
        the reoccurrence and do not disappear. Another striking difference is 
        that because they have no need to count imaginary nouns, they believe 
        that when one thinks of a rosebush, one's thoughts are actually interacting 
        with the real rosebush, not a mere mental one. For English speakers, the 
        impact is seen in the premium we place on time: &quot;time wages, rent, 
        credit, interest, depreciation charges, and insurance premiums&quot; (Whorf, 
        pg. 153). It also explains the monotony and regularity impressed on English-speaking 
        cultures. </span></p>
      <p><span class="text"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But 
        if Whorf never advocated linguistic determinism or linguistic relativism, 
        what was this sustained example for? What was it doing in his book? Certainly, 
        this example seems like a salient point to support either the weak or 
        strong version of the Whorfian hypothesis. </span></p>
      <p><span class="text"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 
        fact, Whorf himself answers these questions many times over in his collection 
        of manuscripts. What Whorf claimed was not a linear system where either 
        language influenced culture, or culture influenced language, but where 
        &quot;in main they have grown up together, constantly influencing each 
        other&quot; (Whorf, pg. 156). As in the sustained example between English 
        and Hopi, one is hard-pressed to say where the linguistics begin and where 
        the culture ends. If commonsense about numbers and counting exist, why 
        didn't both English and Hopi develop similar counting schemes. And when 
        did the language influence the culture back? Whorf admits that we can't 
        really tell, &quot;but in this partnership the nature of language is the 
        factor that limits free plasticity and rigidifies channels of development 
        in the more autocratic way ... [language] can change to something really 
        new only very slowly, while many other cultural innovations are made with 
        comparative quickness&quot; (Whorf, pg. 156). </span></p>
      <p><span class="text"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
        individual to Whorf is a microcosm that contains &quot;all the give-and-take 
        between language and the culture as a whole, wherein is a vast amount 
        that is not linguistic but yet shows the shaping influence of language&quot; 
        (Whorf, 147). In this dynamic system are the variables of thought, language 
        and culture which feed off each other and create the &quot;microcosm that 
        each man carries about within himself, by which he measures and understand 
        what he can of the microcosm&quot; (Whorf, pg. 147). </span></p>
      <p><span class="text"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For 
        Whorf, the whole picture is necessarily complicated. Our thoughts and 
        perception must have impact on our words. Whorf suggested that: </span></p>
      <p><span class="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For 
        instance, if a race of people had a physiological defect of being able 
        to see only the color blue, they would hardly be able to formulate the 
        rule that they saw only blue. The term, blue would convey no meaning to 
        them, their language would lack color terms, and their words denoting 
        their various sensations of blue would answer to, and translate, our words 
        'light, dark, white, black' and so on, not out word 'blue'. </span></p>
      <p><span class="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But 
        words form part of grammar, and &quot;formulation of ideas is not an independent 
        process, strictly rational in the old sense, but is part of a particular 
        grammar&quot; (Whorf, pg. 212). Culture is built from an accumulation 
        of thoughts and words, which in turn has a give-and-take relationship 
        with language as Whorf articulated in quotes above. And in turn, language 
        affects how we &quot;cut up and organize the spread and flow of events 
        as we do, largely because, through our mother tongue, we are parties to 
        an agreement to do so, not because nature itself is segmented in exactly 
        that way for all to see&quot; (Whorf, pg. 240). And we have come full 
        circle, but in the real world this cycle never ends. </span></p>
      <p><span class="text"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whorf 
        answered the current debate on the Whorfian hypothesis almost 50 years 
        ago in his book. As to the strong version, Whorf would claim that it is 
        not the case that language determines thought categories, because this 
        phrasing reduces the dynamic transformation into a simple one-way linear 
        state. As for the weak version, Whorf knew that while there were connections 
        between language and culture, there were no correlations. One could not 
        say that languages that have no tense markers do not objectify time and 
        thus have cultures that believe in ritual accumulation. And a case in 
        point would be Chinese, which has no tense markers, but whose nouns are 
        all mass nouns, and which certainly objectifies time. It is fascinating 
        that Chinese can get along without tense markers even though we have the 
        Western view of time being cyclical, and can indicate past, present and 
        future without recourse to tenses. This further demonstrates how intertwined 
        culture, thought, and language are. It cannot be that noun classes determine 
        tense classes, or Chinese, like English, should have tense markers while 
        Hopi have none. </span></p>
      <p><span class="text"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, 
        Whorf probably never intended for gross language differences such as: 
        1) lexical differences (one culture has a word for &quot;filial piety&quot;, 
        while another doesn't), or 2) syntactic differences (one culture has a 
        counterfactual construction while another doesn't) to connect with cultural 
        or thought differences. The examples he gave were more about how a commonsense 
        is hidden in basic grammar, such as that of the Hopi and English comparison. 
        </span></p>
      <p><span class="text"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An 
        example from Takao Suzuki's book, Words in Context, is truly in the spirit 
        of this kind of Whorfian example. And it is an English one. Consider the 
        verb &quot;to drink&quot; in English. You can drink coffee, tea, water, 
        and soup. So it appears that drink has to do with liquids and it has to 
        do with not chewing whatever is ingested. But we do not drink all liquids. 
        For example, lighter fluid is &quot;fatal if swallowed&quot;, not &quot;fatal 
        if drunk&quot;. This is true for all poisons as well. Also, we &quot;swallow&quot; 
        solid medicine, but we &quot;take&quot; liquid medicine. So we see that 
        in two special cases - poisons and liquid medicine, we do not use the 
        word drink. One may now assume that drink means &quot;orally taking some 
        liquid that is expected to maintain one's physical well-being&quot; (Suzuki, 
        pg. 19). But even this misses something, because we can say &quot;He drank 
        vodka till he passed out&quot;, and here we know that drinking tequila 
        does not exactly maintain your well-being. Another clue to what drinking 
        really refers to is seen in Socrates' death. How did Socrates die? People 
        usually say that &quot;He died by drinking hemlock&quot;, not &quot;He 
        died by swallowing hemlock&quot;, and here I think we see more clearly 
        that drinking must also have a volitional aspect to it - the wanting to 
        ingest something. So drinking is really &quot;the voluntary oral ingestion, 
        without mastication, of liquids, excluding liquid medicine, with which 
        that one expects to, whether correctly or not, reach a specific physical 
        state in mind.&quot; I really don't think any dictionary or native speaker 
        would define drink in that way. And that is exactly Whorf's point. </span></p>
      <p><span class="text"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because 
        we cannot accurately define such a common word, we are not even aware 
        of the logical boundaries it imposes on our formulation of ideas. When 
        we say drink, we are actually invoking personal volition and end-state 
        goal. When we need to use the word drink, our mind must be logically filtering 
        in and out the necessary conditions: Is chewing involved? Is it liquid 
        medicine? Is it voluntary? Is there a goal of physical state in mind? 
        All this logical equating, however, is invisible to us. All we say is 
        the word &quot;drink&quot;, and when it's used inappropriately, we feel 
        this awkward nudge inside of us, but we can't articulate why it's wrong. 
        And &quot;drink&quot; is just one word. Imagine the net of logical if/or/and's 
        that language must impose on us that we are not conscious of. This is 
        what Whorf truly meant when he says that &quot;formulation of ideas is 
        not an independent process, strictly rational in the old sense, but is 
        part of a particular grammar&quot; (Whorf, pg. 212). Language contains 
        commonsense. </span></p>
      <p><span class="text"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And 
        yet, we should be painfully aware of the interplay between thought and 
        language - that someone must have created the word from a concept, but 
        that the word has been shaped by culture and time, and it is now unconsciously 
        shaping our thoughts. </span></p>
      <p><span class="text"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This 
        paper began with Pinker's stand against Whorf's ideas. Not only did Pinker 
        distort many of Whorf's ideas however, we have seen that contemporary 
        discussions of Whorf never articulate the dynamic system he suggested. 
        In fact, most of the debate that comes under the heading of the Whorfian 
        hypothesis has nothing to do with Whorf himself. It might surprise many 
        that Whorf never uses that term in his book. In the places where he refers 
        to it directly, he calls it the &quot;linguistic relativity principle&quot; 
        (Whorf, pg. 214 and pg. 221). A principle is like a theory that tries 
        to explain phenomena in the environment, whereas a hypothesis is a prediction 
        based on an underlying theory. Whorf saw his theory as more of an intrinsic 
        part of reality from which hypotheses could be made, rather than a hypothesis 
        itself. He was trying to explain phenomena rather than trying to predict 
        one. </span></p>
      <p><span class="text"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contemporary 
        accounts of the &quot;Whorfian hypothesis&quot; also neglect another important 
        element that recurs in his papers, and that is his motivation for carving 
        out such a principle. The impetus lay mainly with the infant science of 
        quantum relativity and quantum mechanics in the 1940's. Scientists realized 
        that as they entered the quantum realm of particles and quarks that normal 
        words could no longer correctly describe what was happening, and that 
        illogical things happened constantly. Even half a century later quantum 
        physics still holds very counterintuitive concepts and notions. R.P. Feynman 
        has claimed that &quot;I think I can safely say that nobody today understands 
        quantum physics&quot; and Roger Penrose (1986) commented that the theory 
        &quot;makes absolutely no sense&quot;. Whorf realized that this was due 
        to the way our language was structured. We had taken common sense too 
        far and are surprised that &quot;Newtonian space, time and matter are 
        no intuitions. They are recepts from culture and language. That is where 
        Newton got them&quot; (Whorf, pg. 153). He notes that &quot;modern thinkers 
        have long since pointed out that the so-called mechanistic way of thinking 
        has come to an impasse before the great frontier problems of science&quot; 
        (Whorf, pg. 238). </span></p>
      <p><span class="text"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We 
        are confused for example by experiments that show interference of electrons 
        where only one was used. In layman's terms, that is like a one-handed 
        man clapping. Whorf suggests that we have problems with this counterintuitive 
        situation because our grammar forces us to construct sentences and in 
        turn ideas into actor-action pairs where events are caused by something 
        else. Even in cases where there is no real actor, actorship is assigned 
        to a dummy pronoun, such as &quot;It is raining&quot;, where &quot;it&quot; 
        is referring to nothing but which makes it sound like the &quot;it&quot; 
        is doing the raining. But in Nootka, as Whorf showed in the boat and feast 
        example that Pinker dismissed as clumsy, they do not have subjects or 
        objects, but rather just verbs that imply what we call nouns. Action occurs 
        independent of subject or object, and it is not surprising that many Amerindian 
        speakers have much less trouble comprehending the paradoxes of quantum 
        mechanics than English speaking scientists do. </span></p>
      <p><span class="text"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What 
        Whorf wanted to do was to suggest that a better grasp of the modern physics 
        could be achieved if we made a conscious effort to make our physics language 
        more verby, and less agent-oriented, and this is an approach that David 
        Bohm has suggested. Whorf also uses this as an occasion to explain why 
        other less technological cultures and languages may help technological 
        advancement in ways that could not have been foreseen. </span></p>
      <p><span class="text"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It 
        feels appropriate to end this discussion of what Whorf really said with 
        his most often-quoted passage that most undergraduate Psychology, Linguistics 
        and Anthropology students read somewhere. Many of us have read the passage 
        before, but it is hard to read that passage in the same light again: </span></p>
      <p><span class="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We 
        dissect nature along lines laid down by our native languages. The categories 
        and types that we isolate from the world of phenomena we do not fine there 
        because they stare every observer in the face; on the contrary, the world 
        is presented in a kaleidoscopic flux on impressions which has to be organized 
        by our minds - and this means largely by the linguistic systems of our 
        minds. We cut up nature, organize it into concepts, and ascribe significances 
        as we do, largely because we are parties to an agreement to organize it 
        in this way - an agreement that holds throughout our speech community 
        and is codified in the patterns of our language. The agreement is , of 
        course, an implicit and unstated one, BUT ITS TERMS ARE ABSOLUTELY OBLIGATORY; 
        we cannot talk at all except by subscribing to the organization and classification 
        of data which the agreement decrees. [emphasis from original] (Whorf, 
        pg. 213-214)</span></p>
      <p><span class="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His 
        first few lines seem so deterministic that one does not pay much attention 
        when he talks about the origins of this agreement. The agreement &quot;holds 
        throughout our speech community and is codified in the patterns of our 
        language&quot;. Because it is codified in our language, he cannot be referring 
        to language itself, but must be referring to culture. Thus, it is cultural 
        and social mores that are codified in our language, which in turn dissects 
        nature. Wherever this quotation appears, we are often so primed by the 
        opposition to the &quot;Whorfian hypothesis&quot; that we read Whorf as 
        being completely deterministic when he is actually subscribing to a dynamic, 
        fluid and ultimately holistic viewpoint. </span></p>
