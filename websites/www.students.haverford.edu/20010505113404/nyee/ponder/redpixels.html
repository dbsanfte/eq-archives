  <b><span class="text">exploring the connection between virtual and real-life 
  violence </span></b></p>
<p><br>
  <span class="text">A mother watches her son quietly as he plays a computer game. 
  She is mildly concerned as she realizes that the character is a half-decayed 
  corpse, which her son informs her to be a revived vampire. As she watches, the 
  tattered corpse rips a sharp iron ornament from the wall and impales a horribly 
  deformed creature nearby. Blood and intestines splatter on the ground. A chilling 
  howl is heard from the computer speakers. Her son smiles as the creature collapses. 
  Now the mother really concerned.<br>
  <br>
  </span><span class="text"> Mainstream media in the US is not afraid to exploit 
  this parental concern. The media hints that these games might have unhealthy 
  influences on children. Some people warn in no uncertain terms that virtual 
  violence leads to real-life violence. What is interesting is not how willingly 
  the public believe these claims, but how little real evidence there is to support 
  them. The psychological literature is very sparse and inconclusive in this area. 
  Most studies have measured real-life violence with some short-term behavioral 
  difference that many psychologists believe is not a valid and reliable measure 
  of aggression. Clearly if you arouse individuals with intense video games, they 
  may act in ways that seem like aggression, but sports do the same thing. Does 
  playing tennis lead to violence? The reason why no one seems concerned about 
  this latter question is also part of the reason why psychologists have not done 
  much research in this area. <br>
  <br>
  </span><span class="text"> Any study that even suggests violent video games 
  do not lead to real-life violence will come against a great resistance. This 
  resistance is the media pointing at the Colombine incident and crossing their 
  arms - implying &quot;what more is there to say?&quot;. The media exhibits several 
  individuals who commit violent crimes and who have played some violent computer 
  games. They conclude that violence in computer games lead some individuals to 
  commit violent crimes. This line of reasoning is seriously flawed.</span></p>
<p><span class="text">Consider a researcher who is making observations at the 
  exit of Disneyland. His findings indicate that people who come out of Disneyland 
  are, on the average, much younger than a normal population sample. He concludes 
  that Disneyland has the powerful ability to make people younger. The crucial 
  error he made is that he did not bother to stand by the Disneyland entrance. 
  He did not bother to check the average age of people entering Disneyland. If 
  he had done so, he would have discovered that Disneyland has no effect on age 
  whatsoever. When people watch the news and conclude that violence in computer 
  games leads to violence in real life, they are making the same mistake. To make 
  that conclusion, one would need to show that those individuals were not violent 
  before they played those computer games. If those individuals would have committed 
  those crimes whether or not they played violent computer games, then computer 
  games have nothing to do with real-life violence.</span></p>
<p><span class="text"> One reason why this seems a more plausible suggestion is 
  because there are many people, including teenagers, who simply do not like to 
  play those violent video games. Why don't they like to play those games? How 
  are they different from those people who enjoy virtual violence? This line of 
  questioning may be more fruitful because we know that not everyone can be led 
  to like a violent computer game.</span></p>
<p><span class="text"> In a recent online questionnaire study I performed, I tried 
  to explore the connections between individual personality and the appeal of 
  game elements. The questionnaire asked respondents to rate how appealing specific 
  game elements were on a 5 point scale, from very appealing to very unappealing. 
  Some of these included: real-time, turn-base, single-player, graphic violence, 
  and intellectual stimulation. Respondents were also asked to fill out two sections 
  that assessed their scores on two personality scales comprising 9 personality 
  factors. The questionnaire was publicized in online gaming forums and message 
  boards. 380 valid responses were collected. Of the 380 respondents, 31 reported 
  to be female, while 322 reported to be male. The average age was 27.0. The minimum 
  was 13, while the maximum was 64.<br>
  <br>
  </span><span class="text"> The game genre that most violent games fall under 
  is known as the First-Person Shooters, or FPS for short. Here is what was found 
  from the data collected. In general, FPS gamers tend to be male. The elements 
  that comprise the FPS genre are significantly less appealing to female gamers. 
  The older the gamer, the less appealing games from the FPS genre is for them. 
  Respondents who found the FPS elements appealing tended to be more extraverted. 
  Extraverts are affectionate, friendly and intimate. They love to talk and be 
  in company of others. They are very sociable and have many friends and contacts. 
  Craving excitement and thrills, they work and play at a fast pace. They usually 
  have cheerful, optimistic outlooks on life in general. They also tend to score 
  high on the Agreeableness scale. Individuals high in this scale see others as 
  honest and well-intentioned. Thus they are often straight-forward and frank 
  with others, and are willing to help and trust in them. They are humble, sometimes 
  self-effacing, and are usually tender-minded and easily moved.<br>
  <br>
  </span><span class="text"> This kind of personality profile is almost exactly 
  the opposite that the media</span><span class="text"> wants portrayed. One possible 
  explanation for this personality description is not difficult to come by however. 
  People break things when they get mad or frustrated and doing so often helps 
  them feel better. Instead of conceiving violent video games as fueling aggression, 
  it is perhaps more convincing to argue that violent video games help to release 
  tension and frustration. And this safe environment for releasing tension allows 
  teenagers to become better adjusted than individuals who cannot find ways to 
  release their pent-up anger.<br>
  <br>
  </span><span class="text"> The above personality profile is for the FPS gamer 
  in general, and does not differentiate between a 15 year-old gamer from a 50 
  year-old gamer. Clearly, age should matter. What if we looked at a 13-16 year-old 
  group and a 30-36 year old group separately and did the same analysis? Dividing 
  the respondents into 7 age cohorts of 40 respondents each, we get a better grasp 
  of what is going on. <br>
  <br>
  </span><span class="text"> Gamers from 13-19 years of age who enjoy FPS games 
  tend to score high on the Agreeableness scale. It is from this age range that 
  the general agreeableness trend originates. Gamers from 20-23 years of age who 
  enjoy FPS games tend to score high on Extraversion but they also score high 
  on the Judging/Perceiving scale. Perceivers are very flexible and adaptable. 
  They like to let life live and enjoy the flow. They are spontaneous and prefer 
  the tentative over the definite. They like to keep their options open and like 
  to move from topic to topic. They usually have difficulty bringing projects 
  to an end and may appear indecisive and sloppy. As we move into the 24-26 age 
  range, an interesting thing happens. FPS gamers in this age range tend to score 
  high on Neuroticism. Someone with high neuroticism is easily affected by the 
  surrounding atmosphere. They get worried easily, are quick to anger, and easily 
  discouraged. They often feel uneasy and embarrassed. They have difficulty resisting 
  temptations and coping with stress. What is interesting is that this tendency 
  did not appear in the general analysis. <br>
  <br>
  </span><span class="text"> Individually, these trends are only mildly interesting. 
  It is when they are taken together as parts of a whole that the story reveals 
  itself to be much more complicated than what we had bargained for. For one thing, 
  there is no such thing as a FPS gamer personality. We now know that such a general 
  profile is meaningless because FPS games, like other game genres, mean something 
  different for gamers of different ages. Thus, different game genres in general 
  attract different kinds of personalities, but these personalities also change 
  depending on age. This is further complicated by the fact that most gamers usually 
  enjoy several different genres.<br>
  <br>
  </span><span class="text"> This complexity is one of the other reasons why research 
  has been sparse in this area. Any trained psychologist knows that the answer 
  cannot be the simple yes or no, that it must lie between, and that the dynamics 
  must take into account not only personality, but social, family and developmental 
  factors as well. The story at this point is complex already, but it is still 
  only a shard of the entirety of what is happening. Psychologists have shied 
  away from this profound problem not out of cowardice, but because the most important 
  question is whether virtual violence causes real-life violence and they know 
  that these games are not leading to mass violence.<br>
  <br>
  </span><span class="text"> In fact, one quick moment of reflection should be 
  able to convince anyone of this. Millions of people around the world have played 
  violent computer games, but we only know a handful of people who become murderers 
  and also play those games. On the other hand, many people who drive cars will 
  become involved in a fatal car accident in their lives. On average, driving 
  cars lead to more deaths than violent computer games. The media magnifies the 
  few incidents that have occurred, and people forget about the vast majority 
  of people who play these games who never end up killing anyone. Driving is more 
  dangerous than playing computer games, but unfortunately, car accidents do not 
  make headline news. No one remembers car accidents. More than a year after the 
  shooting however, everyone still remembers Colombine.<br>
  <br>
  </span><span class="text"> The attentive reader might have noticed as they read 
  the personality profiles that if people who enjoy FPS games tend to score high 
  on Extraversion and Agreeableness, then this also means that people who do not 
  enjoy FPS games tend to score low on Extraversion and Agreeableness. People 
  who score low on the Extraversion scale are usually known as Introverts. Introverts 
  are reserved and formal. They prefer to be alone and seldom seek out company. 
  They tend to stay in the background and perform their activities at a more leisurely 
  pace. They have a low need for thrills and have a less exuberant attitude in 
  general than extraverts do. Individuals low on Agreeableness have a cynical 
  and skeptical outlook on life. They find it hard to trust others and often appear 
  guarded and reluctant to get involved. They are aggressive and competitive, 
  especially when placed under conflict. They often feel superior to others, and 
  are hard-headed and rational. What is ironic is that this the way the media 
  normally portrays hard-core violent gamers. <br>
  <br>
  </span><span class="text"> But why might gamers who do not enjoy FPS games tend 
  to be more introverted and less agreeable? Why are they the ones described as 
  aggressive and competitive? This is harder to explain. Perhaps they find it 
  difficult to express their emotions and thus difficult to release their frustration 
  in virtual simulations. Perhaps they find it difficult to resolve their own 
  emotional states. And here I leave the readers with a provoking suggestion that 
  the media has never considered. Perhaps it is the people who do not like violent 
  video games who we should really be concerned about. </span></p>
