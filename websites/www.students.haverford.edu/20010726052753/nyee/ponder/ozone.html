        <span class="text">Environmentalists have threatened us with an ozone 
        depletion catastrophe scenario for quite some years now, and there have 
        been skeptics who have questioned whether reality has been exaggerated 
        in an attempt to mislead the general public. In our age of information 
        technology, we no longer have to rely on the media for truth, not especially 
        when we can find the data ourselves. </span></p>
      <p><span class="text"><br>
        Preliminary searches on the net produced the oft-reproduced images of 
        a depleting ozone layer over Antarctica, such as these: </span></p>

        And indeed, the graphical data seems compelling and worrying. However, 
        all these three graphs of varying graphical sophistication seem somehow 
        preoccupied with the month of October. A little more research tells us 
        that a yearly polar vortex concentrates high concentrations of man-made 
        CFC's in the Southern stratosphere due to several meteorological reasons 
        and this causes severe ozone depletion. The peak of this polar vortex 
        is around October. So far, our story seems to confirm the environmentalist's 
        hype. </span></p>
      <p><span class="text"><br>
        The hype ends when we look at other months of the year. Raw data was available 
        on a British Antarctic research team's webpage (http://www.nerc-bas.ac.uk/public/icd/jds/ozone/). 
        The data contained monthly averages of ozone values (measured in Dobson 
        Units) from 1957 to 1998 for the months August to April measured from 
        Vernadsky station. Analyzing the data in Statistica, we can produce the 
        following graph for October: </span><br>
      </p>
      <p><img src="4.jpg" width="598" height="366"></p>
      <p><br>
        <span class="text">which seems essentially similar to the ones we had 
        before. Now, if we did the same for the month of February however, we 
        get this graph: </span></p>
      <p><img src="5.jpg" width="611" height="375"> <br>
        <span class="text">where we see that February averages haven't really 
        changed at all. In fact, the averages of 1957 and 1998 are almost identical. 
        Looking at the standard deviation of monthly averages, we see that the 
        Jan-Mar months have exceedingly stable ozone values. This is because CFC's 
        break down ozone into oxygen and UV constantly changes oxygen back to 
        ozone. The more oxygen there is from ozone breakdown, the more ozone will 
        be produced by UV reaction. So, what happens is that the environment balances 
        things out. </span></p>
      <p><img src="6.jpg" width="507" height="217"></p>
      <p> <br>
        <span class="text">Now, is the ozone hole getting bigger? The answer clearly 
        depends on what month you're talking about. In October, yes. In February, 
        no. Now you see how easy it is for environmentalist fanatics to misrepresent 
        the issue and create misleading graphs. Is the ozone depletion situation 
        getting worse? Yes. Is ozone replenishing getting better? Yes. And since 
        the ozone hole is confined to the South pole because of meteorological 
        reasons, will the entire ozone eventually disappear? No. </span></p>
      <p><span class="text"><br>
        The situation appears that even though manmade CFC's are destroying more 
        ozone than ever before, more ozone is being created than ever before as 
        well. What about the UV problem? It appears that less UV is getting to 
        the ground than before as well, and this is because of the increased cloud 
        cover due to global warming. </span></p>
      <p><span class="text"><br>
        In conclusion, the ozone hole is getting bigger, but only in October, 
        and it is not causing any harm, and it will never be severely depleted 
        as a whole. Are environmentalists spewing out more fact or more hype? 
        You have access to the Internet. You decide. </span><br>
