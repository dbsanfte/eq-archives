      <TD><B><A NAME=1></A>Why am I writing this?</B>
	<P>
	I've never really wanted to be a teacher, but for the past four summers I
	have taught middle school students in one way or another. This summer will
	be my fourth summer teaching. I've encountered many different attitudes towards
	knowledge and it is always so refreshing to have students who are genuinely
	learning for the sake of learning. They made the summers worthwhile.
	Unfortunately, they were far and few between.
	<P>
	The impetus for writing the book came from a student who asked me whether
	I could write something about those big questions (not only philosophy, but
	evolution and evolutionary psychology) in life in such a way that a freshman
	in high school could understand it. I sort of laughed it off when she suggested
	it, but then the dream came back to haunt me in very compelling way. Here
	was a chance for me to write out my outlook of the world at the present moment.
	It would allow me to integrate all those fuzzy ideas that I never had time
	to interconnect.
	<P>
	And so I started ...
	<P>
	<A NAME=2></A><B>What is the general goal and outline of the book?</B>
	<P>
	The big picture is very important to me. It's no use learning something if
	you cannot apply it anywhere else. And so is the use of reason, which is
	something people these days are more willing to be compromised with faith
	and subjectivity. I've always tried to make what I taught directly relevant
	to my students' lives, but also relevant in their search for meaning in their
	lives.
	<P>
	The book was conceived to have three sections in a hierarchical order. First,
	a section on philosophy that covered the most foundational questions about
	metaphysics, epistemology and ethics. Then, a section on biology, focusing
	on evolution, which is only possible after I have validated reason and science
	in the previous section. Finally, a section on psychology, focusing on
	evolutionary psychology which is a very good middle ground between evolution
	and philosophy. The three sections are conceived to interconnect with each
	other and to lead naturally to the next topic. Furthermore, ideas discussed
	early on recur in later sections as they are bolstered and supported differently
	in each subject area.
	<P>
	I construed the chapters to be very textbook like. When&nbsp;I teach my Intro.
	to Philosophy class this summer to middle school kids, I will probably derive
	my lesson plan primarily from it. There are sidebar comments and quotes,
	questions as you go along, to actively engage the reader. The chapter end
	questions are there not only to review what's been talked about, but more
	importantly to expand on what's been discussed.
	<P>
	<A NAME=Name></A><B>Do I have a name for this book?</B>
	<P>
	I'm thinking about "Elements", but I don't think I can be sure until I finish
	all three sections.
