      <TD VALIGN=top><A NAME="Intro."></A>Before we leave Ethics altogether, we
	are going to now focus on a specific topic under ethical controversy - abortion.
	We will deal with this subject by using what are known as thought experiments,
	and we will not deal with abortion as directly as people do in normal arguments.
	A thought experiment is a hypothetical analogy or story that has the essense
	of the elements under debate but sheds new light on certain aspects of the
	debate.
	<P>
	A well-known example of a thought experiment is Newton's "proof" that all
	masses with different weights fall just as quickly when air resistance is
	removed. Newton asked his friends to consider what would happen if a 5 pound
	weight were tied to a 10 pound weight and dropped together. Now the prevalent
	theory at that time was that the speed at which masses fall depended on their
	weight. Using this theory, two answers are possible. One could argue that
	the two weighs would fall faster than either would alone because they are
	tied together. But one could argue equally as well that because they are
	tied together, the lighter mass will slow down the speed of the larger mass
	and the total speed should be somewhere in between. Newton showed that because
	of this contradiction, it cannot be that falling speeds depended on the object's
	weights, and thus it must be that all objects fall with the same speed.
	<P>
	I am now going to present three thought experiments for abortion. Each focuses
	on a very different aspect of the debate and each is provocative in itself.
	None of the three is as strong or as conclusive as Newton's but each allows
	us to think of the debate in a different light. The following thought experiment
	has come to be known as the Unconscious Violin Player.
	<P>
	<A NAME=Violin></A>But now let me ask you to imagine this. You wake up in
	the morning and find yourself back to back in bed with an unconscious violinist.
	A famous unconscious violinist. He has been found to have a fatal kidney
	ailment, and the Society of Music Lovers has canvassed all the available
	medical records and found that you alone have the right blood type to help.
	They have therefore kidnapped you, and last night the violinist's circulatory
	system was plugged into yours, so that your kidneys can be used to extract
	poisons from his blood as well as your own. The director of the hospital
	now tells you, "Look, we're sorry the Society of Music Lovers did this to
	you-we would never have permitted it if we had known. But still, they did
	it, and the violinist now is plugged into you. To unplug you would be to
	kill him. But never mind, it's only for nine months. By then he will have
	recovered from his ailment, and can safely be unplugged from you." Is it
	morally incumbent on you to accede to this situation?
	<P>
	<I>Thomson, Judith J., (1971). "A Defense of Abortion," _Philosophy and Public
	Affairs_, I, 1, 47-66.</I>
	<P>
	From the title of Thomson's book, it should be obvious what her take on the
	issue is. Nevertheless, her thought experiment is a sound one. When reading
	through though experiments, you should focus on several things:
	<P>
	1) What elements are being highlighted in the story? Are the elements being
	represented accurately?
	<P>
	2) What is the underlying point? Which direction is the author leaning towards?
	<P>
	Let us consider Thomson's story more. Is her representation of pregnancy
	fair? What crucial part of pregnancy is Thomson leaving out? Do people get
	pregnant suddenly regardless of what they've been doing? Why does Thomson
	choose a famous violin player? Is this a fair comparison to a fetus? When
	you have a child, do you automatically know what they will be in the future?
	What is the difference between potential and certainty here? And certainly
	there is no conspiracy theory involved in normal pregnancy.
	<P>
	<A NAME=Fetus></A>Let us turn to our next thought experiment. This one is
	from Paulos book, A Mathematician reads the Newspaper. Imagine if the world
	were suddenly hit with a high amount of radiation and all women were very
	likely to have 50 fetuses when they got pregnant. Now we have the medical
	technology to allow all fetuses to come to term, but without any medical
	attention, all fetuses and the mother would die.
	<P>
	The weight of the argument focuses on two things: 1) the rapid and unsustainable
	population explosion if all babies were allowed to come to term, 2) the need
	of intervention. It also forces us to weigh the value of a potential life
	against that of the risk of overpopulation and the starvation that must follow.
	If we will not have enough food to feed a child anyway, why should we let
	a baby come to term? Americans may argue that this is not the case in their
	country, but if the world were condensed to a village of 100 people (keeping
	all ratios the same), 50 people in the village would be suffering from
	malnutrition. Starvation and malnutrition are very real problems. Certainly,
	when we choose between people who have realized their potentials and those
	who have yet to, we should choose the former if we could only keep one alive.

      <TD><A NAME=Infanticide></A>Now let us consider one final thought experiment.
	This one is more elaborate and dramatic than the previous ones.
	<P>
	Imagine that a woman in coma is raped while in coma. She regains consciousness
	the day she gives birth to a child. The doctors most certainly knew she was
	pregnant, but they were in no position to abort the child without the mother's
	consent. When the woman bears the child, she realizes that the child cannot
	be hers. Furthermore, the child is severely deformed and will never be able
	to walk properly or have an IQ of higher then 60. She also recognizes that
	she cannot take care of the child because it would constantly remind her
	of being raped. After talking with the doctors, she concludes that if the
	child lives, it would live in pain and suffering even in adoption, and asks
	the doctors to kill the child. Should they?
	<P>
	The thought experiment is directed at pro-choicers. It questions why infanticide
	is illegal when abortion is legal. If pro-choicers believe in the rights
	of the mother, then certainly her rights remain when the child is born. Mothers
	abort their fetuses because they are undesirable. Why can't mothers decide
	to kill their undesirable children (humanely of course)? Is there some magical
	divide between a child one moment in and out of the womb? What real difference
	is there? Is one dead and the other alive? Having a soul won't help you here
	either (Occam's Razor). Furthermore, if it DNA testing of fetuses becomes
	legal and parents want to abort deformed infants they will be allowed to.
	Is there really a difference between this scenario and killing a deformed
	child once it's born if we didn't know before hand. This thought experiment
	forces us to recognize that a mother's rights must have limits somewhere
	or even murder can be easily justified.

      <TD VALIGN=top>Here are three thought experiments unrelated to abortion:
	<P>
	1) To see how crucial this excess baggage of ours is, imagine that musicologists
	unearthed a heretofore unknown Bach cantata, definitely by the great man,
	but hidden in a desk and probably never yet heard even by the composer himself.
	Everyone would be aching to hear it, to experience for the first time the
	"qualia" that the Leipzigers would have known, had they only heard it, but
	this turns out to be impossible, for the main theme of the cantata, by an
	ugly coincidence, is the first seven notes of "Rudolph the Red-nosed Reindeer"!
	We who are burdened with that tune would never be able to hear Bach's version
	as he intended it or as the Leipzigers would have received it.

	2) Since some of you may be a little weary of Putnam's Doppelganger on Twin
	Earth, let me tell my own science fiction story... Suppose lightning strikes
	a dead tree in a swamp; I am standing nearby. My body is reduced to its elements,
	while entirely by coincidence (and out of different molecules) the tree is
	turned into my physical replica. My replica, the Swampman, moves exactly
	as I did; according to its nature it departs the swamp, encounters and seems
	to recognize my friends, and appears to return their greetings in English.
	It moves into my house and seems to write articles on radical interpretation.
	No one can tell the difference.

	3) Suppose that I'm locked in a room and given a large batch of Chinese writing.
	Suppose furthermore (as is indeed the case) that I know no Chinese, either
	written or spoken, and that I'm not even confident that I could recognize
	Chinese writing as Chinese writing distinct from, say, Japanese writing or
	meaningless squiggles. To me, Chinese writing is just so many meaningless
	squiggles. Now suppose further that after this first batch of Chinese writing
	I am given a second batch of Chinese script together with a set of rules
	for correlating the second batch with the first batch. The rules are in English,
	and I understand these rules as well as any other native speaker of English.
	They enable me to correlate one set of formal symbols with another set of
	formal symbols, and all that "formal" means here is that I can identify the
	symbols entirely by their shapes. Now suppose also that I am given a third
	batch of Chinese symbols together with some instructions, again in English,
	that enable me to correlate elements of this third batch with the first two
	batches, and these rules instruct me how to give back certain Chinese symbols
	with certain sorts of shapes in response to certain sorts of shapes given
	me in the third batch. Unknown to me, the people who are giving me all of
	these symbols call the first batch a "script," they call the second batch
	a "story," and they call the third batch "questions." Furthermore, they call
	the symbols I give them back in response to the third batch "answers to the
	questions," and the set of rules in English that they gave me, they call
	the "program." Now just to complicate the story a little, imagine that these
	people also give me stories in English, which I understand, and they then
	ask me questions in English about these stories, and I give them back answers
	in English.
	<P>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suppose also that after a while I get
	so good at following the instructions for manipulating the Chinese symbols
	and the programmers get so good at writing the programs that from the external
	point of view-that is, from the point of view of somebody outside the room
	in which I am locked-my answers to the questions are absolutely indistinguishable
	from those of native Chinese speakers. Nobody just looking at my answers
	can tell that I don't speak a word of Chinese.
