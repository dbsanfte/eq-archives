        <span class="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
        controversy surrounding animal rights is a dense and almost impenetrable 
        one because arguments are often so entangled with subjective emotions 
        that it is hard to tell where emotions begin and where reason ends. It 
        is hard to answer such questions as &quot;How can you justify torture 
        as research?&quot; because it is laden with assumptions. Catch-phrases 
        such as &quot;animal abuse and wholesale slaughter&quot; are capable of 
        ending discussions altogether not because of their logical force but because 
        of the weight of their emotional implications. Even the seemingly more 
        rational arguments for animal rights are often founded on unspoken subjective 
        assumptions. Starting with a close examination of Peter Singer's arguments 
        and then a careful construction of my own, I will try to demonstrate that 
        animals do not deserve rights.<br>
        </span><span class="text"><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peter Singer is well-known 
        for his book <i>Animal Liberation</i> where he argues for the need to 
        bring animals into the moral calculus because they have the capacity to 
        feel pain and pleasure. His main argument is founded on the concept of 
        equality. According to Singer, &quot;the basic principle of equality does 
        not require equal or identical treatment; it requires equal consideration. 
        Equal consideration for different beings may lead to different treatments 
        and different rights.&quot; He then points out that racism and sexism 
        are wrong because they deny this equality. And yet to use the measure 
        of intelligence or language as the admission ticket to this equality community 
        is an arbitrary one, and Singer asks: &quot;If possessing a higher degree 
        of intelligence does not entitle one human to use another for his or her 
        own ends, how can it entitle humans to exploit nonhumans for the same 
        purpose?&quot; For Singer, the yardstick for admission is the experience 
        of suffering - &quot;If a being suffers, there can be no moral justification 
        for refusing to take that suffering into consideration.&quot; <br>
        <br>
        </span><span class="text"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To 
        shed light on one of the problems in Singer's argument, let me rephrase 
        a question of his: If possessing a higher degree of intelligence does 
        not entitle one human to use another for his or her own ends, how can 
        it entitle humans to exploit plants for the same purpose? There are plants 
        and animals, such as oaks and oysters, that have no pain perception mechanism. 
        Does this mean that they can be massacred without reason? In fact, most 
        living beings would not be included in this equality community because 
        most of the beings alive today are bacteria and single-celled photosynthetic 
        organisms. This shows that &quot;the ability to suffer&quot; is just as 
        arbitrary a line to draw as the ability to reason or to communicate. <br>
        <br>
        </span><span class="text"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, 
        evolution has guaranteed that for every organism, there is another organism 
        almost like it. There is a chain of organisms that connects animals to 
        protozoa to plants. To be truly fair, shouldn't the line be drawn at &quot;the 
        living&quot;? The logical conclusion of Singer's suffering argument is 
        that all living beings would clearly suffer if they died. Thus all living 
        things deserve equal consideration. There is only one thing the normal 
        human individual can do to preserve as many lives, and thus prevent as 
        much suffering as possible, and that is to kill himself. This is because, 
        in his lifetime, a normal human &quot;slaughters&quot; billions of bacteria 
        and micro-organisms. Singer claims that animals are the same as human 
        beings, but he refuses to see that the chain of similarity does not end 
        there but extends to the insects, micro-organisms and plants. He accuses 
        others of drawing arbitrary lines, but he is guilty of doing so himself. 
        <br>
        <br>
        </span><span class="text"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singer 
        wants to claim that all suffering must be taken into equal consideration, 
        and thus the suffering of a crippled ant deserves equal consideration 
        as that of a crippled human child, and if we could only save one, Singer 
        has to say that we should flip a coin and decide or else we would be speciests. 
        The major flaw in Singer's argument is that not only has he chosen the 
        arbitrary measure of suffering, but he assumes that all suffering is equal. 
        He wants us to believe that the suffering of a human child is comparable 
        to that of an ant's. This is clearly absurd. The suffering that a Holocaust 
        victim endures is more intense than that an ant will ever endure because 
        human beings have the cognitive and emotional capacity that other animals 
        do not have. Shoot a son in front of his mother and the mother feels anguish 
        beyond imagination that will scar her for as long as she lives. On the 
        other end, when male langurs kill the infants of captured female langurs, 
        the female langurs seem to become attracted to the male langur and promptly 
        resume estrus. Singer is trying to avoid pulling intelligence and human 
        cognition into the equation, but he fails to see that it is impossible 
        not to. It is human intelligence that can inflict and understand the kind 
        of overwhelming agony that is part of human existence. It is also human 
        intelligence that allows us to bestow and understand the kind of awe-inspiring 
        joys that are also part of it. <br>
        <br>
        </span><span class="text"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I 
        want to take this point one step further. To feel physical pain is not 
        necessarily the same as suffering. For example, we know that masochists 
        take pleasure in pain, and when a child takes a vaccine shot, we do not 
        say that the child is suffering. We also know that the mother suffers 
        even though it is his son that died and no physical pain is done to her. 
        The most important aspect of suffering is the mental one, not the physical 
        one. To suffer requires cognitive and emotional capacities that animals 
        do not have. I contend that all, if not most, animals do not suffer because 
        they do not have the necessary mental components to process mental pain 
        into suffering. They merely feel pain. And the distinction is necessary 
        because the two words have very different connotations. Suffering is unique 
        to beings that have the mental capacity to understand pain beyond the 
        physically inflicted ones. <br>
        <br>
        </span><span class="text"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Animals 
        do not suffer beyond what we claim them to suffer. We are merely personifying 
        animals, giving them qualities that they do not have. Rephrasing Shakespeare: 
        There is no animal suffering, but thinking makes it so. Singer's arguments 
        are not sound because they do the same things that Singer claim to be 
        wrong: drawing arbitrary lines. He also fails to realize that there is 
        more than one kind of suffering. Even if his equality community based 
        on suffering is tenable, we would still have reason to treat animals differently 
        from human beings because we can suffer and derive joy under much more 
        circumstances and to greater degrees than they can. Singer claims that 
        speciests violate the principle of equality because they &quot;allow the 
        interests of their own species to override the greater interests of members 
        of other species.&quot; I would claim that Singer himself is a speciest 
        because he is allowing the lesser interests of other species to override 
        the greater interests of man.<br>
        &nbsp; </span><span class="text"><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also argues that the 
        concept of rights is nonsense because &quot;the real weight of the moral 
        argument does not rest on the assertion of the existence of rights, for 
        this in turn has to be justified on the basis of the possibilities of 
        suffering and happiness.&quot; He claims that to argue that animals do 
        not have rights is thus &quot;misguided&quot;. After our discussion of 
        the different kinds of suffering and happiness that humans and animals 
        experience, I feel that a venture into whether animals have rights is 
        not misguided but necessary. <br>
        </span><span class="text"><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even Singer himself recognizes 
        that &quot;the principle of the equality of human beings is not a description 
        of an alleged actual equality among humans; it is a prescription of how 
        we should treat human beings.&quot; Equality and rights are not intrinsic; 
        they are bestowed. Rights are the artificial constructs defining how different 
        parties agree to treat each other. Beings that have not developed enough 
        to fully understand rights do not have access to their full set of rights. 
        This is why parents have jurisdiction over their children until they become 
        independent. Organisms that do not have the lifetime potential to understand 
        rights, however, do not deserve to be given rights, because to do so would 
        jeopardize ours. You cannot reason with a leopard to not attack you if 
        it's hungry. To give the leopard rights would be absurd because it will 
        not respect yours. Rights are a responsibility that the individual holds 
        to the community and other holders of rights. Animals that do not have 
        the capacity to understand rights or responsibilities cannot be given 
        rights or that would destroy the whole concept of rights altogether. Rights 
        are contracts held between rational and accountable parties, and animals 
        do not deserve to be in our moral community of rights because we cannot 
        punish them for violating our rights - the same way it is absurd to punish 
        a new-born infant for breaking a vase accidentally. <br>
        <br>
        </span><span class="text"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
        crucial reason why animals do not deserve rights is not because they cannot 
        reciprocate them, but because the rights that we give them must be taken 
        from ones that humans have. There is not an infinite pool of rights to 
        be given. Rights are balanced between parties involved. To give rights 
        to individuals who do not deserve rights means taking them away from people 
        who deserve them. The right of the whale to live means taking away the 
        right of the Eskimo tribes to hunt them. Thus the main reason why animals 
        should not have rights is not because they do not deserve them, but because 
        they infringe upon our rights.<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        </span><span class="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Humans 
        have a right to luxury, provided they gain it rightfully through work, 
        that animals do not have because we have the capacity to enjoy more of 
        life than they can. For example, one of Leonardo Da Vinci's paintings 
        or Mozart's arias will mean nothing to a pig or falcon, but they might 
        be very important to a human individual. Because of our mental capacity, 
        we can experience pleasures far above that which an animal can. And animal 
        rights activists must recognize this much because it would be absurd to 
        argue that pigs deserve to be housed in fully urbanized apartments just 
        as humans do. It would also be absurd to argue that a human child should 
        live the way pigs do on a farm since it would keep him alive and well-fed. 
        Human existence is much more than just survival. Our cognitive abilities 
        have opened a new world of higher pleasures to us and we have a right 
        to them. <br>
        <br>
        </span><span class="text"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does 
        this justify the unnecessary suffering tha</span><span class="text">t 
        animals go through so that we can have them on our plates? - the animal 
        rights activist will ask. We've seen that suffering is not the right word 
        to describe it, and I will argue that evolution has guaranteed that life 
        be full of necessary suffering. Life feeds on itself to survive. Should 
        we save the gazelle from the hungry African lion? Should we save every 
        gazelle from every hungry lion? But for something to continue living, 
        something else has to die. This is a fact of life and to claim that it 
        is wrong is na&iuml;ve. <br>
        <br>
        </span><span class="text"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do 
        vegetarians think that nothing dies to feed them? What of the millions 
        of &quot;innocent&quot; green lives that are &quot;harvested mercilessly&quot;? 
        If omnivores slaughter animals, then vegetarians massacre plants. The 
        flaw in both is attributing human qualities and connotations to non-human 
        organisms. The right to luxury, the circle of life, the conclusion that 
        animals do not deserve rights, and the wisdom of a balanced diet are sound 
        arguments for consuming meat. <br>
        <br>
        </span><span class="text"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vegans 
        and vegetarians often try to confront meat-eaters with images of animals 
        being killed in slaughterhouses. They argue that if a meat-eater is not 
        willing to go and kill a cow for his steak, then his buying it at the 
        supermarket is immoral. However, the same argument can be used in human 
        surgery. If a patient is unwilling to operate on another to remove their 
        appendix, then it is immoral for this patient to ask the doctor to perform 
        the same operation on him. Repugnance and disgust are not valid moral 
        arguments. Maggots feasting on a human corpse is disgusting, but are the 
        maggots immoral? Thus, this confrontational question that animal rights 
        activists pose has nothing to do with the morality of the dilemma. <br>
        <br>
        </span><span class="text"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does 
        this mean we can slaughter animals without reason? I contend that we should 
        not for </span><span class="text">the same reason we should refrain an 
        infant or an insane patient from swallowing their own waste. We do it 
        because it is revolting and causes us unnecessary discomfort. We should 
        prevent inhumane or unnecessary ill-treatment of animals not because they 
        will suffer, but because we will. If swallowing one's waste is not morally 
        wrong, why do we feel impelled to prevent it? For the same reason why 
        we should prevent inhuman treatment of animals even though there is no 
        moral reason why we should do so. Disgust is our natural emotion to ward 
        away thoughts of death and there is no reason why we should immerse ourselves 
        in unnecessarily disgusting situations if we can prevent them. <br>
        <br>
        </span><span class="text"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A 
        thought experiment may drive this point home. Imagine a computer program 
        that generated a virtual dog in a virtual home where the computer user 
        can interact in realistic ways with the virtual pet, including slaughtering 
        it with a chainsaw. Is it immoral to kill the virtual dog with a chainsaw? 
        No, then why do we feel impelled to prevent it from happening? Inhumane 
        treatment of animals should be prevented not for their sake, but for ours, 
        because we find it difficult to not attribute our agony, anguish, and 
        despair onto them and this in turn causes us discomfort. We have to ask 
        ourselves whether suffering is in the eye of the beholder with regards 
        to animals and plants. <br>
        <br>
        </span><span class="text"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
        major flaws in arguments supporting animal rights is that their loud objective 
        statements are based on subjective assumptions. For example, Tom Regan 
        proposes that animals have rights because of inherent values. He asks 
        us to &quot;consider that you and I, for example, do have value as individuals 
        - what we'll call inherent value.&quot;, but he is silent as to what this 
        value is, where it comes from, and why we have it in the first place. 
        Peter Singer falls in the same trap with his equality and suffering that 
        he does not carry to their logical conclusions. <br>
        </span><span class="text"><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We hear slogans such as 
        &quot;All animals are equal&quot;, &quot;All living things have rights&quot;, 
        &quot;Every living thing is inherently valuable&quot;. And yet we never 
        hear it explained what makes all animals equal? - What are rights? - Why 
        do all living things have rights? - What makes all living things inherently 
        valuable? Some have proposed rights as the concept that will create equality, 
        but they fail to see that there are many gradations of rights and that 
        there is such a thing as partial rights. They feel that anything that 
        has rights must be equal, but this is not true. Others have proposed souls, 
        and argue that because animals and unborn fetuses have souls, it is wrong 
        to claim the lives of either. They fail to see that if such an abstract 
        concept as soul can be proposed, that it is equally easy to propose &quot;soul 
        races&quot;, &quot;soul ages&quot;, and &quot;soul inferiority&quot;. 
        Proposing such abstract, ungrounded concepts create more problems than 
        they can solve. <br>
        <br>
        </span><span class="text"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 
        the end, what they are trying to achieve is to give animals something 
        they do not have. Singer tries to make animals capable of human suffering. 
        Regan tries to claim that animals and humans are equally valuable. But 
        concepts such as suffering and value are human concepts. Agony, anguish, 
        despair, joy, achievement and inspiration are human emotions and they 
        are used to describe animals by animal rights activists. They claim that 
        those of us who fail to grant animals equal moral status are anthropocentric 
        because we are singling ourselves from our equals. I claim that animal 
        rights activists are anthropocentric because they are trying to ascribe 
        human concepts and emotions to animals that do not have them. Animals 
        remain animals until we try to make them human, and this anthropocentric 
        mistake is where the controversy of animal rights truly begins. </span>
