        <p align="left"><span class="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
          movie, The Cell, presents one perspective of what another person's mind 
          might appear to us, but the reality of what we know about neurobiology 
          and psychology gives us a very different picture. </span></p>
      </div>
      <p><span class="text"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
        Cell presents human minds as beautiful visual theatres capable of astounding, 
        seamless tapestries of unrelated memories and ideas. Our thoughts, as 
        we all have experienced, on the other hand, are adamantly verbal. They 
        are adamantly verbal, because it takes considerable effort to mentally 
        construct a visual imagery of anything coherent and realistic. </span></p>
      <p><span class="text"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More 
        importantly, the visual imagery our minds form is perceived mainly from 
        underlying assumptions and not from what's really there. For example, 
        imagine a guard in armor. Now try to rotate the image 360 degrees. Notice 
        that you can't possibly fill in all the details of the guard as you spin 
        him around, but you can get the big picture right and your mind assumes 
        what the missing gray areas should be. </span></p>
      <p><span class="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thoughts 
        require a thinker. There are no other images other than the ones you try 
        to conjure up. No reservoir of cinematic wonders exist in your mind hidden 
        somewhere. To someone else, your 3D image of the armored guard would appear 
        crude and unfinished. And this was just one object. Imagine the shabby 
        appearance of your image of a 3D world to anyone else. They would peek 
        around the corner of something and discover a gray slab at best. More 
        often than not, they would simply find a void.</span></p>
      <p><span class="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, 
        one thought is seldom coherently linked to the next. And the reason why 
        we change thoughts is unknowable to another person. Not only would they 
        find no fully-colored images, there would also be no sustained image. 
        Most of the time, fragmented sentences flicker by, leaving their importance 
        to be guessed.</span></p>
      <p><span class="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A 
        foreign mind is unable to decipher importance because the network of relationships 
        of every person's mind is different. An image that triggers a cascade 
        of memories for me will not trigger those same memories for you. Our minds 
        are built from a network of neurons that have relationships built up from 
        their past experiences. There probably is no correspondence between my 
        concepts and yours at the neural level. Thus, there is no way for you 
        to experience my mind coherently because our neural maps are different. 
        Because you cannot perceive my mind without passing it through your network 
        of relationships, my thoughts would appear to be encrypted. And I alone 
        hold the network key to decode the triggered thoughts.</span></p>
      <p><span class="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although 
        mind travel might never prove to be very interesting, one consolation 
        is that no one can ever eavesdrop or steal your thoughts and make any 
        sense out of them &#133; in case any of you were on the verge of developing 
        schizophrenia. </span> </p>
