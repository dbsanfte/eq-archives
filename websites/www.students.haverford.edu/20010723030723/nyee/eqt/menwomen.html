            <p class="header">Men are from Ogguk. Women are from Kelethin.</p>
            <p class="normal"><span class="normal">EverQuest appeals to male and 
              female players in different ways, and motivates them to continue 
              playing EverQuest for different reasons. Female players find the 
              social interaction of the game more appealing than the male players 
              do (<a href="metagame.html#1">link</a>). Male players, on the other 
              hand, enjoy the sense of power the game gives (<a href="metagame.html#1">link</a>). 
              Several respondents articulated this difference:</span></p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p class="normal">He is really turned on by the power and prestige 
                aspects of the game, whereas I use it as an extended chatroom. 
                So we had some conflict over me getting twinked out purely because 
                I was a real woman. [f, 19, dating]</p>
              <p class="normal">It's something we both enjoy, but we tend to enjoy 
                it seprately. I enjoy it because of the social aspect, while he 
                just enjoys the game itself. [f, 23, engaged]</p>
              <p class="normal">Men like this game more. Men tend to be more agressive 
                and therefore are driven by item acquisition more than women. 
                My wife has not shown much desire to play EQ even though she has 
                a very simular personality to mine. She is not driven by the goals 
                within the game; even though in real life she will be driven to 
                complete a project and carefully add to it to make it better. 
                The women that I have met in EQ are almost always people who want 
                to play the game for social interaction. To them the game is not 
                about getting items or even levels, its about talking to friends 
                while they do it. Something very interesting I have observed; 
                men who play women tend to level much slower than men who play 
                men. They are more social and less driven to get one more item. 
                I have found them to grow frustrated at the long camp times for 
                items they really need. [m, 26]</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p class="normal">Female players are attracted to the social aspects 
              of EQ, whereas male players are more drawn to the ability to feel 
              powerful. Thus, it is not surprising that female players are more 
              likely to group with people they've grouped with before (<a href="ingame.html#3">link</a>), 
              while male players are more likely to be goal-oriented (<a href="ingame.html#4">link</a>). 
              As an example,</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p class="normal">For instance, I will rather play in a group just 
                for company, even if the exp gain is minimal, whereas my partner 
                tends to literally AVOID other players. [f, 23, engaged]</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p class="normal">Moreover, we also find that female players are more 
              likely to be in officer or leader positions in guilds(<a href="guilds.html#2">link</a>). 
              Female players are also more likely to participate in guild events 
              (<a href="guilds.html#3">link</a>) and to enjoy being in guilds 
              (<a href="guilds.html#4">link</a>).</p>
            <p class="normal">In a sense, EQ is mainly just a game to male players, 
              whereas for female players, it is a place where real friendships 
              can be made. Male players look for hunting partners, while female 
              players look for chat partners. For male players, communication 
              is the side-effect of coordinating group strategy. For female players, 
              EQ is a huge chat-room with a lot of other things to do. And thus, 
              female players are more likely to feel that their EQ friendships 
              are comparable, if not better, than their real-life relationships 
              (<a href="relate.html#2">link</a>). Because female players are more 
              likely to be forging real relationships, they are also more likely 
              to feel that a lot can be learned from EQ (<a href="metagame.html#2">link</a>).</p>
            <p><span class="normal">Female players are also more attached to their 
              characters, and are less likely to sell their characters for money 
              than male players are (<a href="metachar.html#2">link</a>). This 
              is probably because their characters have emotional relevance to 
              them from the relationships that have been forged with it, whereas 
              for male players it is a game, and there is less emotional attachment 
              to their characters.</span><br>
