<h2 align="center">EverQuest Study</h2>
<p align="left">Thank you for taking the time to participate in this study of
EverQuest.</p>
<p align="left">I am interested in several different aspects of EverQuest and
have created separate questionnaires for these areas. I invite you to fill out
as many or as few of these questionnaires as interests you. Feel free to browse
through them before selecting one to fill out.</p>
<p align="left">Also, I would really appreciate it if you could spread the word 
  of this study by telling EverQuest gamers of this webpage address. I am looking 
  to gather as many responses as I can. These forms will be up until April 15th.</p>
<p align="left">Any questions or comments should be directed to <a href="mailto:nyee@haverford.edu">nyee@haverford.edu</a>.</p>
