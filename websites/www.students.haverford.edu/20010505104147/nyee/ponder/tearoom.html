<p> <span class="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John Searle 
  argued against the strong version of the AI theory with his Chinese Tea Room 
  thought experiment. In this thought experiment, a person in a room is given 
  a set of instructions in English to deal with a stream of incoming Chinese symbols 
  by producing a stream of outgoing symbols from a row of &quot;symbol wheels&quot;. 
  An external individual might suppose the person inside can comprehend Chinese. 
  Searle claims that this thought experiment countered the view that the human 
  mind was just a complex automaton that processed information without truly understanding 
  it as is the case with computers. This is because every Chinese speaker understands 
  what he is saying or writing. But how deep does this understanding go?</span></p>
<p><span class="text"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us 
  first take English linguistic examples. How would you pronounce the nonexistent 
  word &quot;VAPORON&quot;? Do you pronounce the first syllable as &quot;VEY&quot; 
  or &quot;VA&quot;? Most would say the latter even though &quot;VAPOR&quot; is 
  pronounced &quot;VEY-PUR&quot;. The reason for this is also the reason why &quot;NATION&quot; 
  becomes &quot;NATIONAL&quot;. But can you articulate the reason?</span></p>
<p><span class="text"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now try 
  to pronounce the nonexistent word &quot;CABAHAX&quot;. Which syllable gets stressed? 
  The first, right? What about &quot;CABAHAXAL&quot;? Which syllable gets stressed? 
  This time it's the third. Why does the stress mark jump from the first to the 
  third syllable? Do you understand why?</span></p>
<p><span class="text"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let's take 
  a look at compound formation. Do you say &quot;mice-infested&quot; or &quot;mouse-infested&quot;? 
  Do you say &quot;rats-infested&quot; or &quot;rat-infested&quot;? Why did you 
  choose the plural noun in the first set, and the singular noun in the second 
  set? What is the underlying rule? </span></p>
<p><span class="text"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Give me 
  a definition of the English verb &quot;to drink&quot;. You can only drink something 
  if it is a liquid and if you don't chew it. Something that is partially liquid, 
  like clam chowder, is eaten. But why is it that we swallow solid medicine, but 
  we don't drink liquid Tylenol? - we take liquid Tylenol. Also, people swallow 
  poisonous liquids such as lighter fluid. They don't drink it. Does that mean 
  we can only drink things that keep us healthy or alive? No, because we can drink 
  tequila till we pass out. Moreover, we can construe a situation so that a person 
  can &quot;drink&quot; lighter fluid. The person doing the drinking has to be 
  doing it deliberately. So we can say, &quot;Crazy Uncle Tom is drinking lighter 
  fluid again.&quot; Another famous historical case is Socrates. Socrates did 
  not die by swallowing hemlock. Socrates died by drinking hemlock. So a complete 
  definition of &quot;drink&quot; must be the act of orally ingesting a liquid, 
  excluding liquid medicine which is &quot;taken&quot;, where the actor knows 
  to a good degree how the ingested liquid will affect his or her own mental and 
  physical state. Before anyone can use the word &quot;drink&quot; correctly, 
  their minds have to acknowledge these rules and filter through different situations 
  unconsciously.</span></p>
<p><span class="text"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet 
  these phonetic, morphological, syntactic and semantic rules are hidden from 
  our conscious mind. We do not realize most of that is going on when we make 
  a simple sentence. The word &quot;drink&quot; poses rigid boundaries on when 
  it can or cannot be used, and &quot;drink&quot; is just one common word. How 
  much of why we speak what we speak do we understand?</span></p>
<p><span class="text"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us 
  now consider an example from daily life. Suppose you are in a conversation with 
  a friend and in the course of the conversation they seem to stare at a spot 
  behind you. What do you do? Now ask yourself why you did it. And did you know 
  that reason before or after you turned around to follow their gaze? </span></p>
<p><span class="text"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here lies 
  the crucial part of the whole dilemma. Does our understanding come before or 
  after our words and actions? If it comes before, then we know exactly what we 
  are saying or doing, but if it comes after, then we are merely interpretating 
  our own actions to give a hind sighted rationalization. </span></p>
<p><span class="text"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To connect 
  this back to Searle's thought experiment, an a priori understanding means a 
  module inside the room that sends out the commands to the symbol wheels, while 
  an a posteriori understanding means a module outside of the room that sees what 
  the room does and then tries to interpret why it did just that. </span></p>
<p><span class="text"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is 
  analogous to the James-Lange theory of emotion. They claimed that our emotions 
  are interpretations of our physiological changes. Our happiness does not cause 
  our blood to flow faster or heart to beat faster, but rather, the interpretation 
  of these two give rise to the emotion of happiness. This would explain why sometimes 
  we feel depressed or happy, but we don't know why and we try to understand why 
  and give it a reason. </span></p>
<p><span class="text"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The difference 
  is very important - between a true understanding and a rationalized understanding. 
  The former means we know exactly why we do what we do; the latter means we really 
  don't and can't. The evidence seems to weigh towards the less sobering end of 
  the question, but it is not clear how much we are merely interpretating and 
  how much we direct because we clearly have an understanding of what we are saying 
  and we have a control of what we want to do. But is it an illusion? Is the greatness 
  of human minds born out of a superior interpretative module that tries to make 
  sense of behavior that it has no control over? Is this what we call humanity?</span></p>
