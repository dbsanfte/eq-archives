      <TD VALIGN=top><A NAME="Intro."></A>There are many important questions in
	Metaphysics, but in this brief section we will only consider whether an external
	reality exists. Many people have never asked themselves this question and
	for them the question is absurd, but for those who have, the thought itself
	may be quite unsettling.
	<P>
	The question stems from a very basic fact that we will never know how a color
	really looks like to someone else. It wouldn't do to ask them, because it
	is obvious that our color names have no real correspondence to the essence
	of the color itself. We could not know even if we could open their brains
	up and hook our senses to theirs because as soon as we perceive their color,
	it is already ours. The same is true not only for colors, but for taste,
	smell, beauty, love, sadness, and consciousness. The fact is that we can
	never be sure that anyone else is conscious.
	<A HREF="#questions">(1)</A><A NAME=1></A>
	<P>
	<A NAME="color story"></A>At this point, I cannot help but include a diversion
	to a story about colors and god. A color-blind person cannot tell the difference
	between two colors. This implies that he is missing certain color palettes
	from his color vision. To him, those missing colors are unimaginable because
	he cannot synthesize them from his existing colors.
	<A HREF="#questions">(2)</A><A NAME=2></A> Let us take a broader view though,
	and we realize that a concept of a missing color should not trouble only
	those who are colorblind, but also those that have normal vision. This is
	because since you can never be sure your color palettes match up perfectly
	with someone else's, you can never be sure that the two of you have different
	color palettes and are actually seeing colors the other cannot see, a color
	they cannot even imagine. The colorblind person can never find his missing
	colors and neither can we. And if we cannot even begin to even fathom this
	missing color which we know must exist, how can we even begin to prove the
	existence of god whose existence we are not sure of.
	<P>
	When I thought of and wrote the pseudo-argument down several years ago, I
	was arguing for the limits of reason and a need to make a leap of faith.
	Now, I realize that the argument could be used both ways. You could use it
	to argue that faith, not reason, connects you to god. Or you could use it
	to argue that god doesn't exist, and so there's no use looking for one.
	<P>
	The argument itself is naturally not logically sound. The most important
	flaw is that it implies at the end that because you cannot disprove the existence
	of god, then such a being must exist. One can show the absurdity in this
	claim by reversing the argument - because you cannot prove the existence
	of god, therefore he does not exist. The lack of a proof or disproof has
	no bearing on the truth of the matter.
	<A HREF="#questions">(3)</A><A NAME=3></A>
	<P>
	<A NAME="Occam's Razor"></A>The lack of a proof, however, should have bearing
	on our beliefs though. Given two propositions trying to explain the same
	phenomena, it is logical to choose the simpler and therefore more economical
	one. This reasoning is referred to as Occam's Razor. For example, I could
	choose to explain that when people die, that is the end of the story. Or
	I could choose to say that some go to heaven, some go to hell, and some limbo,
	depending on the judgments on a family of omnipotent beings. The strength
	of the first theory is that it has nothing more to explain. The second, on
	the other hand, has to explain where and what heaven is, the same for hell,
	and how the omnipotent beings came to be in the first place. The second theory
	answers the death question by assuming things that are even harder to explain.
	The beauty of Occam's Razor is its simplicity. When you can explain something
	simply, why would you choose to invent superhuman beings?
	<A HREF="#questions">(4)</A><A NAME=4></A>
	<P>
	I assure you that all this is connected to external reality, but before we
	get back to that, let's conclude this business with god, which is also a
	big part of metaphysics. Let us apply Occam's Razor now to the dilemma posed
	by my pseudo-argument. The argument left us with the problem of god, which
	we could neither prove nor disprove. But the problem is only there because
	of a assumption that god might exist. People who are agnostic choose to give
	equal weight to both positions: does exists and does not exist, but Occam's
	Razor would argue that the "does not exist" theory is simpler and therefore
	has more weight and validity. By putting equal weight on both sides, one
	is saying that both are equally simple and economical, where this is clearly
	not the case. A truly rational person who felt that there was neither a good
	proof or disproof regarding the existence of god should choose to not believe
	in a god.
	<P>
	<A NAME="Pascal's&nbsp;Wager"></A>Some of you have undoubtedly heard of Pascal's
	Wager before, and are at this point slightly perturbed as to what you ought
	to believe. Pascal's Wager was formulated by the mathematician Pascal. It
	goes like this: Say a god exists, then you ought to believe in this god,
	or else you would be sent to Hell. Say no god exists, then you would have
	only wasted a small amount of time and this saves you from risking your afterlife
	since we don't know for sure whether god exists or not. This line of reasoning
	may seem very solid, but it is not. This is because once we allow the existence
	of a god, it opens the door for all other sorts of supernatural beings who
	we could not prove. So what, you say.
	<A HREF="#questions">(5)</A><A NAME=5></A>
	<P>
	Here's Nick's Anti-Wager: The being we call god is merely a pawn working
	for a powerful and rational force in some far-off galaxy. This force is trying
	to weed out people who are irrational by seeing who would be stupid enough
	to believe in his god illusion so easily. Those that believe in this illusion,
	he will send to eternal damnation and he will deliver the rational beings,
	those who stoically refused to believe in a god, to heaven. So say this force
	exists, then you should not believe in god or you will be sent to hell. Say
	this force doesn't exist, then there would be no god or hell, and you would
	have only wasted a small amount of time. So in the end, it is better to not
	believe in god. <A HREF="#questions">(6)</A><A NAME=6></A>
	<P>
	<A NAME=back></A>Now with all this background, we can get back to the issue
	of an external reality. Let us look at the two sides. If an external reality
	exists, then it puts us as ephemeral perceivers in a world that is infinite
	in information. If an external reality does not exist, then we are the makers
	of this infinite amount of information. Not only that, we ourselves are the
	creators of all the laws in the universe, and are aware of many of this laws.
	We are the authors of all the literature we have read, makers of all history,
	architects of all buildings and so on. More importantly, we are the creators
	of the universe which would be revolving for us alone, and every other human
	being is our creation whose desires, beliefs and emotions are created by
	us. Occam's Razor would certainly ascribe to the first theory. It would take
	a very conceited person to believe in the second view and claim that they
	are the only conscious being in the world. <A HREF="#questions">(7)</A>
	<A NAME=7></A>
	<P>
	What do we do though when we meet such people who believe that reality exists
	in their minds, and their minds alone? Well, first of all, I have to say
	that if you knew two people with such thoughts, it would be interesting to
	put them together for a while and see what they said to each other. Secondly,
	if they believe that they control the world, then they certainly wouldn't
	mind you pushing them off a building. Thirdly, if they control the world,
	why would other people be arguing with them about their thoughts in the first
	place? Lastly, if all else fails, tell them that evil exists in the world
	and the only reason why this would be is because they are evil.

  <TABLE BORDER=1 WIDTH="70%">
    <TR>
      <TD VALIGN=top>1) A big question in Metaphysics that we will not have time
	to dwell on is whether free will exists. Free will is your ability to control
	your life and do what you want to do. Are your actions controlled by your
	genes, parents, society, culture or do they come from your own volition?
	(We will encounter this question again later in Classical Conditioning under
	Psychology).
	<P>
	<I>Things to think about: Do a few factors or do many different factors
	contribute to your behavior and actions? Do you always know why you did what
	you just did? Do you always have control over your actions? How much influence
	do your parents and peers have on you? </I>
	<P>
	2) Evalate the following statement in the context of spirits or soul: "A
	wheel that turns nothing is nothing."
	<P>
	<I>Hint: What does a soul do? </I>
	<P>
	3) When we see another person cry and we think to ourselves that the other
	person is sad, where is that sadness really coming from? Why can we never
	be sure that other people are actually sad?
	<P>
	<I>Hint: Do you necessarily need to know how to get to the right answer to
	answer correctly, especially on multiple choice tests? Distinguish between
	overt behavior and actual knowledge or emotion. </I>
	<P>
	4) To explain how we are different from animals, some people postulate that
	we have a soul while animals don't. This invention of a soul is also used
	to explain why racism is wrong. Why does a concept of "soul" fail to really
	solve either problem?
	<P>
	<I>Hint: If you can invent the existence of souls, what else would you be
	able to invent? How about &#147;soul races and cultures"? </I>
	<P>
	5) In many kinds of divination (fortune-telling), a cure or ward can be acruired
	to ward off something bad that would otherwise happen. Or alternatively,
	you are told to do something so that the bad thing won&#146;t happen. Usually
	these wards or actions cost you money that goes into the pockets of the
	fortune-tellers.
	<P>
	In fact, it is illogical and paradoxical to accept that one can know the
	future and be able to change it at the same time. Why?
	<P>
	<I>Hint: Think about it in the context of a story. John goes to a fortune-teller
	who tells him he will die in a car crash tomorrow. So the next day, John
	is obviously not going to go out of his house (let us assume that the fortune
	teller is able to know the future). And since he doesn&#146;t go out, he
	doesn&#146;t get into a car accident. At the end of the day, he calls the
	fortune-teller and tells her how she saved his life. What is wrong with the
	logic of all this? </I>
