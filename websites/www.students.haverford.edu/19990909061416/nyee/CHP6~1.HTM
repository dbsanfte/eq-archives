      <TD VALIGN=top><A NAME="Intro."></A>In this section, I'm going to argue that
	standards must exist. And I'm going to do this in a very roundabout way that
	uses a rule of inference to prove my case. The main backbone of the proof
	is a contradiction proof.
	<P>
	The general formula of a contradiction proof (from Geometry) is that we start
	by assuming a proposition. We do not care about the truth or falsehood of
	the proposition at the beginning. If by following the implications of the
	initial statement, we reach a contradiction, then it must be false. This
	kind of proof is used to falsify a statement, thereby proving its opposite.
	A contradiction cannot be used to verify the initial statement however.
	<P>
	<A NAME=Assumption></A>So let us begin with an initial statement. It is that
	absolute standards do not exist for any value or moral. Theories that ascribe
	to this statement are either nihilists or relativists. Relativism states
	that no one culture's or person's values or morals can be better than any
	other's because there are no real standards.
	<P>
	<A NAME=Consequences></A>This second statement is an inferrence from the
	initial statement, and it would be so regardless of whether we pulled the
	relativists into this. But by doing so, we will be able to show the absurdity
	in relativism when we show the falsehood of the initial statement.
	<P>
	<A NAME=Relativism></A>So the second statement is that because no standards
	exist, no one person's values or standards can be better than another's.
	Now if this were true, then let person A be a relativist, let person B claim
	that relativism is absolutely wrong and booboo. Now since the relativist
	must believe that relativism is true for him to be a relativist, he cannot
	say that person B is wrong. In other words, he is forced to accept person
	B's judgment. Therefore, he has to accept that relativism is both right and
	wrong. In fact, given person B and C, they can generate any number of statements
	where they are all both right and wrong. Moreover, person B and C do not
	need to use reason to argue. They can claim they think so because they think
	so. Since there are no standards, their method of reaching an answer must
	be equally valid as one where reason is used rigorously. They can claim that
	logic is invalid and relativists could say nothing about that.
	<P>
	And yet not only have we shown that logic is valid, but we have shown in
	the beginning that something cannot be both X and not-X at the same time.
	Our initial must therefore be false because we have reached some very serious
	contradictions. Therefore, relativism must be false as well, because it forces
	you to accept illogical statements as being correct.
	<P>
	Now, our initial statement was that absolute standards do not exist for anything.
	If this statement is wrong, then it must be the case that absolute standards
	exist for somethings. Think about this for a moment. This statement is profound
	because it raises our certainty even further. Not only can we know things,
	but there are things out there that are absolutely true and cannot change.
	This implies that somethings are absolutely right and other absolutely wrong.
	What these things are exactly, we will all have to find out ourselves through
	a lot of mental labor.

      <TD VALIGN=top>1) Is it necessary for a society to have rules and laws? Is
	it ethical to force unborn citizens under a set of rules they were never
	given a chance to vote for or against? What are the limits of democracy?
	<P>
	2) Considering capital punishment: If the criminal was a murderer, then won't
	the executioner be performing the exact same "crime"? Can killing another
	healthy human being purposefully be both a moral and immoral at the same
	time?
	<P>
	3) In judging the severity of a crime, is the motive or consequence more
	important?
	<P>
	4) Would the world be a better or worse place if everyone could only tell
	the truth?
	<P>
	5) Evaluate the following statement in the context of community service and
	charity work in general: " And when someone accuses you of being selfish,
	just remember that he's only upset because you aren't doing what he selfishly
	wants you to do." - Harry Browne
	<P>
	6) You are a railroad switch worker, and one day, your loved ones are tied
	on one side of a track, and the other runs off a cliff. A train is quickly
	approaching the split. What should Chris do? Would it make a difference whether
	the train were a passenger train or a livestock train?
