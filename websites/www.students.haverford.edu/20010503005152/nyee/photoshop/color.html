      the Pointillize filter on numbers traced out by shifts in one color, we 
      can create images such as the one below where people with normal vision 
      can see the numbers &quot;52&quot;, and where people who have red-green 
      color-blindness can only see the &quot;5&quot;.</font></td>

      if we create an image where the red spectrum varies more than the luminosity, 
      and it is the luminosity that traces out a number, then we have an image 
      where only people who are red-green colorblind can see the hidden number. 
      This is because people with normal color-vision are thrown off by the red, 
      which the red-green colorblind people can't see. In the image below create 
      using this method, people with red-green color-blindness will see a clearly 
      defined circle.</font></td>

  <tr>

      can even be a little more devious and create an image where people with 
      normal color-vision will see one thing and people with red-green color-blindness 
      will see another. But this is slightly more difficult and the result is 
      only moderately satisfying. Below is an image where people with red-green 
      color-blindness can see a circle and people with normal color-vision can 
      see the letter &quot;s&quot;. However, there are probably people who have 
      mild red-green color-blindness who can see both.</font></td>
