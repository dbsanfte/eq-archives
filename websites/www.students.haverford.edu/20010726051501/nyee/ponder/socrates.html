      <p class="text"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Whorfian 
        hypothesis claims that our language influences or determines our thoughts. 
        This view is very often regarded as an antiquated one that is backwards 
        in construction. Indeed, prima facie, it must be the concept that came 
        first and then the word. Language, however, is entrenched in subtleties 
        that often escape our conscious examination of it. Using an example of 
        a common English verb, I will try to show how much more complicated and 
        dynamic the process is.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Try to define the English 
        verb &quot;to drink&quot;. We drink coffee, milk, water, lemonade and 
        it would seem natural to define it as an ingestion of a liquid. We do 
        not, however, drink all liquids. Liquid medicine such as Tylenol is taken 
        - &quot;Have you taken your Tylenol yet?&quot;, not &quot;Have you drunk 
        your Tylenol yet?&quot;. Also, toxic liquids such as lighter fluid or 
        cyanide are &quot;Fatal if swallowed&quot;, not &quot;Fatal if drunk&quot;. 
        So perhaps the verb &quot;drink&quot; is only applied to those liquids 
        that are naturally supposed to keep us healthy. Yet even this is not true 
        because we can &quot;drink tequila till we pass out&quot; and that certainly 
        is not healthy.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The central facet of &quot;to 
        drink&quot; must lie elsewhere. There is a distinct connotation in &quot;drink&quot; 
        that is absent in &quot;swallow&quot;. Hopefully, you have answered the 
        title of this essay already as we will now use it help us find this facet. 
        Historically, Socrates died by &quot;drinking hemlock&quot;. People do 
        not usually say that Socrates died by &quot;swallowing hemlock&quot;. 
        An implication of &quot;drink&quot; is that the person doing the drinking 
        is doing so voluntarily. Thus, it is possible to say that someone is drinking 
        lighter fluid, but only where the implication is that the person is doing 
        so voluntarily and not by accident - &quot;Crazy Uncle Bob is drinking 
        lighter fluid again&quot;.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only must the person 
        be doing it voluntarily, he must also be doing it himself, and this is 
        important because it is not the case in &quot;swallow&quot;. If a chained 
        person had his jaw forced open and had hemlock poured into his mouth, 
        most people would say that he was &quot;forced to swallow hemlock&quot; 
        and not that he was &quot;forced to drink hemlock&quot;. If we say that 
        someone was forced to drink something, it implies that the person was 
        the one who held the cup in his hand and poured the liquid into his own 
        mouth.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So now we can define &quot;to 
        drink&quot; as the act of orally ingesting a liquid, other than liquid 
        medicine, which a person voluntarily performs himself. The liquid medication 
        exclusion feels inelegant unless we can give a good reason why it should 
        be excluded. And there is one.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notice that we &quot;take 
        a vaccination shot&quot;, &quot;take Claritin and Allegra&quot;, &quot;take 
        liquid Tylenol or Nyquil&quot;. It appears that those medical processes 
        that involve the addition of a chemical to our bodies uses the verb &quot;take&quot;. 
        So the reason why liquid medicine is excluded from drink is because &quot;take&quot; 
        has jurisdiction over those kinds of medical processes. It also implies 
        that the verb &quot;take&quot; is processed before the verb &quot;drink&quot; 
        in our everyday sentence construction or else we would drink liquid medicine.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So every time we use the 
        verb to &quot;drink&quot;, our cognitive processes must have filtered 
        it out from a list of several other verbs and has given notice to the 
        necessary conditions of voluntary action, liquid substance and non-medicinal 
        substance, and have done the same with those other competing verbs. And 
        &quot;drink&quot; is just one common verb. The net cast over our thought 
        by the words we use must be present and active. It is true that our concepts 
        must have given birth to words, but it is equally true that those words 
        gain hidden connotations through time and must in turn limit how we think. 
        In the end, how language evolves is much more dynamic than just a one-way 
        street.</p>
