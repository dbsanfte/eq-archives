Below are a few of my most basic questions, but any advice is welcome.<br>
<br>
When approaching enemy territory is it better to 1) run at full speed to get where you are going as fast as possible OR 2) move cautiously through trees and undergrowth (risking getting separated from the group)?<br>
<br>
Is there any way to &quot;detect&quot; hidden or stealthy snipers?<br>
<br>
Is there any way of readily identifying the enemy at a distance other than individually selecting them and reading their stats?<br>
<br>
What class specific tips can be offered to us up-coming members?  What should we be specializing in and developing in andicipation of RvR?  e.g for a Skald is there any advantage to using Sword over Axe or Hammer?  For Healers - what are the most advantageous spells and strategies?  What should be AVOIDED (if anything) as we apply our XP to skills?  For casters is it better to use DeBuff spells over DD spells?  Id really like to see basic advice for each of the Midgard classes.  Also some indication as to what Class / capability is MOST NEEDED by the guild.<br>
<br>
Beyond that, I already know the 1st two rules of RvR:<br>
  1) Dont get killed.<br>
  2) When the above fails, die with dignity.<br>
but any other advice is welcome <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

They can take you pretty far in RvR (or in life, for that matter :-)).<br>
<br>
1) Get good maps.  There are links from the Siol Lear page to the Coven Nex maps of the frontier.  I've found them more than adequate for anything I've wanted to do.<br>
<br>
2) Follow your leader. Depending on what type of RvR you do, chances are you are rarely alone.  In fact, chances are your group is with other groups.  What you want is to find a good war leader, and then do what they say. Likewise at the group level. If you don't have faith in the raid leader and/or the group leader, go elsewhere.<br>
<br>
3) Don't get in over your head. This means don't do things like charge into a horde of enemies, let an enemy pull you into a horde via /stick, etc.  I made some posts about this in on of the threads on our guild raid, so I won't repeat the details here.<br>

<br>
1)  FOLLOW ORDERS.  Do what your group leader tells you to do, not what you see people shouting to do.  Your group leader will take his orders from the battle commander and relay those to his group.  It makes his job easier, and your chances of winning, much better if everyone follows orders.<br>
<br>
2)  DO NOT GET AHEAD OF YOUR GROUP LEADER.  Unless told by your group leader to go scout or do something else, stay with your group and do not get separated.  You fight as a group, you live as a group, and you often die as a group.  But running off half-cocked is dangerous and self-defeating.  This is my personal No. 1 pet peeve, and not necessarily anyone else's. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Class Information:  All classes have their good points in RvR.  I am far from being an expert, but here is what I've noted:<br>
<br>
Healers:  Aside from healing the group and resing everyone possible, healers help greatly by mezzing and stunning the enemies.  And as far as I'm concerned, you can never have too many healers.<br>
<br>
AE Casters:  I've lumped this group together for obvious reasons, but it mostly pertains to thanes, runemasters and shamans.  AE spells are extremely beneficial.  That is mostly how our forces get wiped out trying to take keeps.  They can be cast through the gates and can kill a LOT of people.  Also, if you hurt an enemy with a spell, even if you don't kill them with it, you will get some realm points if and when they are killed.  There are different kinds of AE spells which have different advantages.  The runemasters and thanes get nice direct damage spells that can really wipe out a party.  Shaman spells are not so damaging, but their poison ae dots can prevent casters from casting and archers from shooting.<br>
<br>
Tanks:  There is no substitute for beating the crap out of an enemy with sheer brute force.<br>
<br>
Spiritmasters:  This is one class we are sorely in need of.  First of all, spiritmasters can send pets through a gate to attack the enemy.  But even more importantly, their pets can see a stealthed enemy even after they have hidden themselves.  Once that pet is targeted on the player, they can't get it off until it kills them, or they kill it.  That is by far our best way to get snipers at this time unless we are lucky enough to catch them and kill them before they hide.<br>
<br>
Skalds:  Skalds are very necessary as well.  One of their main functions, of course, is speeding us all to our deaths!  But skalds can also stun, snare, do a lot of damage with their spells, and they make good tanks.<br>
<br>
Hunters/Shadowblades:  These classes are the best all-around RvR solo classes.  There are many different philosophies regarding what to specialize in, although by far the most popular ones are the &quot;grief&quot; hunters, or those who choose stealth and their weapons as the two things they put the most points into.  I was killed by an enemy shadowblade-type with one backstab, and I never saw him coming.  And we all know the dangers of a good sniper running around our frontiers.<br>
<br>
As far as what you &quot;should&quot; specialize in, specialize in what you like to do.  It is all useful, and who knows, we may find other uses no one has thought about yet!<br>

It is the /face macro. Ever since they shortened the range of /stick, it is not so easy for melee to find that crased archer. Now melee can /face if you are hit, or /assist &lt;name&gt; return key, /face return key, run in that direction while continually hitting /face till your target is in sight. At that point stick to your target and use sprint to stay on their tail. No need to save endurance since you will be able to take them out easily once engaged.<br>
<br>
This works best when you are in the frontiers hunting and a lone sniper thinks she or he can terrorize us. <br>

&gt; to get where you are going as fast as possible OR 2) move cautiously<br>
&gt; through trees and undergrowth (risking getting separated from the group)?<br>
<br>
This depends on the situation. If there is already a heated battle taking place and you are in a hurry to join it then use the direct method.<br>
<br>
If you are in a small group and are not sure what is going on, definitely use trees and such so you do not get surprised and insta-smashed.<br>
<br>
&gt; Is there any way to &quot;detect&quot; hidden or stealthy snipers?<br>
<br>
Basically this is a factor of your level (or stealth skill if you have it) versus their stealth skill.<br>
<br>
&gt; Is there any way of readily identifying the enemy at a distance other than<br>
&gt; individually selecting them and reading their stats?<br>
<br>
Nope.<br>
<br>
What class specific tips can be offered to us up-coming members?<br>
<br>
&gt; What should we be specializing in and developing in andicipation of RvR?<br>
&gt; e.g for a Skald is there any advantage to using Sword over Axe or Hammer<br>
<br>
No difference between weapons really. Hammers are nice versus plate, but its not a big deal really. As a skald I would say always max battlesongs.<br>
<br>
&gt; For Healers - what are the most advantageous spells and strategies? <br>
<br>
Don't get too obsessed with pacification. In the long run, you want good mending also (and some aug).<br>
<br>
My #1 piece of advice for healers in RvR: RE-READ THE NAME OF YOUR CLASS. Your primary duty is HEALING. Heal the tanks. Heal the casters. Do as much mez/stunning as you can, but also HEAL. A tank that you heal a few times is like having 2 tanks. Same with a caster!<br>
<br>
&gt; For casters is it better to use DeBuff spells over DD spells? <br>
<br>
Both.<br>

<br>
1) Learn the frontier<br>
<br>
2) Stay with your group<br>
<br>
3) Follow the instructions of your party, raid, etc. leader<br>
<br>
4) Healers heal and stun. Don't melee unless its absolutely necessary (or small group). <br>
<br>
5) Tanks attack in groups, don't run into a mob solo. Don't let someone drag you into a mob because you are /stuck to them.<br>
<br>
6) Focus on killing casters, rezzers, and snipers.<br>
<br>
7) DO NOT CHASE people too close to their keeps and aggro the npc guards.<br>
<br>
8 )  If you have information to give, make sure its accurate. Don't say &quot;lots of hibs&quot; or &quot;tons of albs&quot;. Get a decent estimate. Always overestimate the numbers. If you see 10, there are probably at least 15-20. If you see 6, there are probably 8-10. It is really horrible when someone says &quot;6-8 Albs at AG&quot;, and you show up with your group of 10 and there are actually 20 there. Don't say &quot;albs here&quot;, say where they are. Don't say &quot;I am dead&quot;, say where you are dead. Don't say &quot;I just got sniped&quot;, say where you got sniped. Provide accurate and valuable information all at the same time. Don't spread it out over multiple tells.<br>

Fundamentally what I think needs to be done is this, we need permanent group and sub-group leaders. This is the first step only.<br>
Everyone will know who their group leader is. If more people show up then the sub group leader will become a group leader.<br>
<br>
The council is talking about who the leaders shall be, but I think some of the leaders will be obvious.<br>

<br>
- Don't charge into the middle of the enemy.  Ye're likely to get surrounded and beat from all sides.  A quick and glorious death but it certainly is not nearly as glorious as cleaving the enemy and surviving!<br>
<br>
- It is sometimes effective to act like you are going to charge into the enemies ranks and turn quickly at the edge of their ranks and sprint back into the middle of your own ranks.  Some newer RvR folks on the enemy side may make the mistake of /sticking to you and winding up in the middle of your ranks.  It's death to them if they do.<br>
<br>
- Stun.  Root.  Mez.  Stun.  Root.  Mez.  I can't say it enough.  As a meleer meself, I know that it's an effective tactic when them dastardly elves use it on me.  Use it on them, I say!  Keep that up enough and have some meleers or some blasters around and the elves will be butchered in no time.<br>
<br>
- Don't get caught alone.  If so, you are meat waiting to be butchered when you get rooted.  You have no one to heal you and no one to defend you if you are away from the group.  You're only chance in RvR is with a group.  It's blind luck if you happen to find someone that you can kill while away from the group.  Blind luck works some of the time.  A good group works most of the time.<br>
<br>
- Don't panic.  Decide what you are going to do before you charge into battle and stick to it.  As long as you are focused on your plan you won't panic.  Panic will kill you faster than any elf.<br>
<br>
- Use your healer if you have one.  Send tells to your healer letting him/her know when you need a heal.  Often healers get so busy in RvR they don't see who needs healing.  Sending a tell is a way to remind them that you are there and need some help.<br>
<br>
- Related to the above tip: KEEP YOUR HEALER ALIVE.  Meleers keep an eye on the healer and don't let them get killed.  If you are a healer, stay out of the thick of things.  Stay close enough to mez and heal but far enough away to avoid damage to yourself.  If you die, the clan has lost more than one warrior.  It's lost all the healing and ressing you could be doing if you were alive.  It's a very large strategic loss to lose a healer.<br>
<br>
- Find points of strategic focus.  This means kills the enemies healers, casters and singers.  This kills their buffs, deletes mezzes, removes their ability to heal and do massive AoE damage.  After that is done, cleaning up the meleers is cake.<br>
<br>
- Agonisties and Glamis are two of the most effective Lear battle leaders I have seen so far.  They are also known to others outside our clan.  If they tell you to do something in RvR, do it immediately.  <br>
<br>
- Communicate all the time.  Make sure others know what you are doing and why.  90% of communication is listening.  Make sure you read what is going on in chat and know what your part is to play.<br>
<br>
- Probably the most important part of RvR (kind of our Primary Directive): THE DEFENSE OF OUR HOMELANDS IS PRIORITY ABOVE ALL ELSE.  Imagine living in a realm where the enemy takes and hold portions of your land almost 100% of the time.  That would be Albion and Hibernia.  Shame to them.  May their fathers forget their faces.<br>

Just what I've seen grouping with some of the higher level Clan members.  But having experience with other types of combat (paintball/various sports)  I know teamwork and communication can not be stressed enough.  I just want to emphasize what Torveig said about communication.  As crazy as RvR gets make sure you communicate with you group and guild letting them know where you are and what you are doing.  If people know what your up too you can back them up and come save the day with a bit more ease. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#676767><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub5.ezboard.com/utorgeirr.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Torgeirr</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>High Councellor</span><br>  Posts: 89<br> <font color=#F2CF7E>(12/20/01 2:46:03 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub5.ezboard.com/ftheclanmaclearfrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=178.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Basic Strategy for RvR</span><hr size=1> A little story from last night.  It was the first time I've ever been part of a fight where flanking/coordination worked, even though it was mostly accidental.  The Albions were unusually active last night, and made a big effort (well, big for Albions :-)) to hold our Milegate and cause us grief coming out of the TP fort.  At one point, I was at Dun Crucheon with 5 members in a group, and we heard that we had a decent force coming out of the TP fort to engage them.  I figured that the broken remnants of the Albion force would be running south down the road at any minute, so I brought my group out to catch them.  We went up the road, no Albions.  We approached the milegate from the Albion side, no Albions except maybe one or two on the wall.  We charged through the gate and completely surprised two that we cut down.  A moment later, bunch of Albions were heading our way all of a sudden from the direction of our TP fort.  We put up a good stand, but got overwhelmed.  30 seconds later, our victorious troops arrived, completely destroying the Albion force.  I was told that the Albions turned to meet our charge in their rear, at which point the main force broke them from what was now their back.<br>
