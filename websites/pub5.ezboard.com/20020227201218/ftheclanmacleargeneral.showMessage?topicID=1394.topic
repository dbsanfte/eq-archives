She's level 12 now, and it's been alright. Hand-to-Hand combat is definately the way to go, and you get double attack at 10 and duel wield at 17. From what I have read, there is no cap on H2H for Beastlords but there is for almost every other weapon they can use. The newbie quests are wonderful and you can get a very nice set of armor by completing them in any race/town. <br><br>My problem really lies with the pets. Now keep in mind, I've never really been a &quot;pet-class&quot; kind of player... But, what is the use of having a pet that can zone when half the zones have tunnels that your pets can not get out of? (Pathing is really really bad) They seem to need more direction than mage/necro/shaman pets, and you can never summon a pet that is your level or above. All the pets I've been able to summon have been blue to me after I buff them. The bonus is that the summon doesn't cost mana, it's a skill... but the buffing of your pet to turn it blue (it cons green upon summon) does cost a lot of mana. The pet does not deal a huge amount of damage, and I find that even on some blue cons (I've been soloing mammoth calves) the pet dies long before the mammoth does. You get a special pet heal that hardly costs a thing, but fights take three to four times as long if you are just sitting there chain healing your pet.<br><br>I fight with my pet side by side, usually with me tanking because I seem to be able to tank better, and I only back off and let the pet tank if necessary. I only fight with my pet outdoors as well, because of bad pathing I find it difficult to manuever in any dungeon/city with any amoount of ease. Plus, pet damage is NOT magical (I found that out in a horrible incident on Wisp Island) and I find that a bit silly since it is a summoned creature. I assume at higher levels you will get better pet buffs, but the only BL's I've seen past level 20 are those that are getting PL'd by friends and are super twinked.  <p><img src=http://home.attbi.com/~geist22/engelsign.jpg> </img><br></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccb9b><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub5.ezboard.com/uamieeofclanmaclear.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Amiee of Clan MacLear</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lass</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#330000>(2/11/02 7:26:53 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub5.ezboard.com/ftheclanmacleargeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1394.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Beastlords?</span><hr size=1> I am a field priestess .. or a beast lord if you prefer that term.  I have recently entered my 11 season of training.  I have a wonderful warder, a wolf by the name of Skye (because he is the colour of the sky in Everfrost when it snows) who follows me around and gets lost often.  He tends to think with a mind of his own and run off.  I have a spell that I can cast upon him after I summon him or cross a border.  This spell enlightens his poor little wolfie brain so that he gains knowledge to be within 4 seasons above or below my training season.  <br>He is a good pet, though he does get lost everywhere.  He tends to show up in the nick of time and I have a special heal for him which is excellent.  It is better than the heal I have for myself and others.  Because of this heal, and because he recovers from battle much more quickly than I do . . I have a tendency to send him after the creature, and then join in once my magical energies are expended which is often rather quickly with the rate at which I fizzle my spells.  Using this technique, I am able to kill creatures above my training.  Simultaneously, I can kill multiple creatures at around/below my season with his help.  Also, Skye is a brave wolf.  When I am in trouble, I can leave him behind while I run and when he can no longer fight, he will vanish.  If the creatures are still after me and I have not gained enough ground, I can resummon him to my side (he requires no magical energy) and then run again.  Doing this, I was able to flee from an orc shaman who would have surely slain me.  <br>I do not use my hands much to fight, for I am much slower with them.  With this smoldering brand a random wizard gave me, I am much quicker and I hit much harder.  I have obtained, and rather easily, all of the Field Priestess armor from Halas.  <br>I very much enjoy my profession and my canine companion.  While I admire, Lanadena, I do not think I could be a shamaness of the Tribunal.  I enjoy the battle, and enjoy the wild life but yet I enjoy my abilities to heal and to spread justice.  <br>I would not chose another profession for anything.  <br><br>-Amiee- <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#deddbf><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub5.ezboard.com/btheclanmaclear.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=jeffryn>Jeffryn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Kin</span><br>  Posts: 41<br> <font color=#330000>(2/11/02 9:31:19 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub5.ezboard.com/ftheclanmacleargeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1394.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Beastlords?</span><hr size=1> I know of a barbarian cousin Beast Lord (I think he prefers &quot;Field Priest&quot; as well) named Thormin. His wolf, named Myk, were often seen near the bandit camp along the Serpent River in Western Karana.  Last I spoke to him, he was doing well, managing to get to about his 13th season, and I think he would like to be in MacLear as well, but so far he has yet to get in touch with an officer to do so.<br><br>I gave to him a steel ulak I found upon one of the dogs from Splitpaw.  (actually, it's the one and only one I have ever found there) and he took to it like a natural, since it's a hand to hand weapon.  Later, a nice erudite lass gave him a dragoon dirk, which he likes better since it's much faster.  Now, he just really needs to finish up his quests to get that nice armor.<br><br>He was a bit disappointed by the spells at first, but learned to appreciate what he had learned. He too was frustrated with Myk often getting lost, and he learned to live without Myk while in Blackburrow.  He wouldn't give up Myk for the world, though....the constant companionship is a friendship he has grown to enjoy.<br><br>/ooc <br>I like the BL so far.  This is the first char that I have had that has had a decent piercing skill, and the speed of such weapons had made me regret not getting Jeffryn to practice them.  As far as the warder is concerned, I just pretend that our warders are outside beasts and have no business in dungeons and cities, so often tell mine to go off by himself when doing so.  I've tried to keep the amount of &quot;higher level&quot; stuff that he got to a minimum, to try to appreciate the BL as a newbie. If not having no other use for the ulak and Yai giving up her wizard, he would still be without a magical weapon. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub5.ezboard.com/ftheclanmacleargeneral.showPrevMessage?topicID=1394.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub5.ezboard.com/ftheclanmacleargeneral.showNextMessage?topicID=1394.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub5.ezboard.com/ftheclanmacleargeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1394.topic&index=4><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/traditional/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub5.ezboard.com/ftheclanmacleargeneral.emailToFriend?topicID=1394.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub5.ezboard.com/ftheclanmacleargeneral.threadControl?topicID=1394.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/traditional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub5.ezboard.com/ftheclanmacleargeneral.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1394.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub5.ezboard.com/ftheclanmacleargeneral.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1394.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub5.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="theclanmacleargeneral">The Great Hall<option value="theclanmaclearfrm8">Inner Court<option value="theclanmaclearfrm6">Events<option value="theclanmaclearfrm5">Provisioner's Square<option value="theclanmaclearfrm4">Chief's Council Chambers<option value="theclanmaclearfrm7">Senate Chambers<option value="theclanmaclearfrm10">Council Hall of Midgard<option value="theclanmaclearfrm9">The Great Hall of Midgard<option value="theclanmaclearfrm12">Inner Circle of Midgard<option value="theclanmaclearfrm11">Crafter's hall<option value="theclanmaclearfrm15">Applicants to Siol Lear</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#330000>- </font><a href=http://pub5.ezboard.com/btheclanmaclear>The Clan MacLear</a><font color=#330000> - </font><a href=http://pub5.ezboard.com/ftheclanmacleargeneral>The Great Hall</a> <font color=#330000> - </font><a href="http://www.clanmaclear.com">The Clan MacLear Homepage</a><font color=#330000> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.6<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
