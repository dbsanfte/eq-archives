Wearing nothing more than a ragged tunic, the damp cold from the stone walls seeped into her body.  The miasma of death and suffering that hung in the air wieghed heavily upon her soul.  The manacles and chains that bound her to the wall rattled as she shifted her aching body to a new position.<br>
<br>
Her captors were taking no chances with her now.  A grim smile touched the corner of her split and bleeding lips.  An entire regiment of Dark Minions (Mostly Orcs) had been put to death today because for a short time, she had actually escaped.<br>
No one EVER escapes from the prisons of the Halls of the Dead.  Thus, her small triumph was all the sweeter.<br>
<br>
She shifted again, trying to find a position a little less uncomfortable.  The simple act of breathing was becoming agony.  Centuri knew she had a couple of broken ribs as well as the collection of whip-welts, cuts and bruises from the last few days.  Somehow, her captors were blocking her prayers of healing.  She hadn’t been in this constant a state of pain since she had learned her first healing spell.  She squinted into the darkness with her one good eye, the other one being completely swollen shut.  Ah well, there really wasn’t anything to see anyhow.<br>
<br>
Ah, but what a day!  Worth every drop of her spilled blood.<br>
A clerical error had put her in one of the minimally guarded detention areas meant for the weakest of the slaves.  Lucky chance had placed her next to the guard station.  A prayer and a softly whispered song lulled the single guard to sleep.  The guard’s own dagger ensured he would never waken.  His dark, hooded cloak aided Centuri in slipping through the dark hallways, just another servant, scuttling off on just another errand, eternally in fear of her masters.<br>
The god of Mischief must have walked beside her, laughing.  It was nearly 2 full hours before her absence was discovered.  More than enough time for her to gather information and arrange for a message to be sent.  They caught her soon after. Not surprising considering how they out-numbered her.  The subsequent beating she endured at the hands of the guards was brutal.  But those few, undiscovered moments had been worth the price.<br>
<br>
And so, she found herself in a new, more secure cell, (the one, she suspected, that had been intended for her all along) chained to the wall.  Awaiting the pleasure of the Dark Masters.  Based upon what she has seen of the Halls of the Dead, Centuri suspected her life would be short indeed once they no longer required her in one piece.  That Monster, Tyvlain Dy’Truin, had been by twice to gloat at her, his possessive gaze made her skin crawl.  She almost wished the Dark ones would kill her. Living long enough to be turned over to that demented fiend left a lot to be desired.<br>
<br>
But now, she had a hope.  Two actually, if Soulshiver had seen what had happened to her and was able to track her down.  She sent a silent prayer after her courier; the message must be delivered at all cost.   Small hopes, but they were enough to push back the darkness.  And, since she really had very little else left to lose….<br>
<br>
A bright, elven song of Praise to Tunare echoed sweetly down the dark hallways. The Masters seethed in rage, yet did nothing.  She was not yet expendable.<br>

Summoning every ounce of concentration he tried to re-establish the communication that had just transpired. “Wait,” he said aloud, “My hands were like this.”  He quickly reassumed what he felt was his original position and tried his utmost to center his thoughts on that gloomy forest scene where he had seen Centuri beset by the Dark Host.  His continued efforts to continue the transcontinental communication was in vain, however, as the only thing that was now audible was the painful heartbeats emanating from his own chest.  How he established the communication in the first place was beyond him.  Now of certain things he was sure of: One, that it was truly Centuri, the Feir’Dal enigma that has appeared before him, so real in fact that he was certain that he could smell the smells of the forest that surrounded her and the smells…of Orcs!  Secondly, though he watched from a 3rd person perspective her attacking and easily overtaking the Orcan marauders, he was certain that she was oblivious to the stealthy grace that was unmistakably his brother, coming upon her unprotected, unguarded flank.  Finally, as a miasma of guilt wracked Soulshivers form, he was aware that he was at fault for the suffering that Centuri was undoubtedly to receive, but also that due to his lack of iniative, the entirety of Blood Circle was about to meet its most perilous adventure.  For in one fell blow, his brother, insignificant in so many ways, has for once, found the one weakness that his Elder brother had ever displayed…the love for another.<br>
<br>
Soulshiver hesitated outside the door to the guildhall in the which he had entered so many times in the past.  For the first time, he questioned if he had made the proper choice in including his Brothers and Sisters in a quest that would most certainly lead to suffering and perhaps even their deaths.  But memory strengthened his resolve. He remembered the countless battles he’d undergone with this motley crew and recommitted the memory of why he’d chosen this path of becoming a member of this great guild in the first place.  In his pausing, he could hear the laughter echo merrily from the seams of the Hall as he was certain Dohpaz was drinking the majority of them under the table.  The fact that it was only 10:00 in the morning did not deter him from this train of thought…he knew his Family too well. He stepped to the doorway and pushed the heavy oak door open to hopefully, temporarily arrest the flow of alcohol.  As Soulshiver walked through the entrance, the conversation immediately turned into cheers of welcome as they quickly found a seat for him at the common table.  Itno, more perceptive to Soulshiver’s typically unreadable expressions was instantly aware that his friend was burdened heavily with something and set out at once to lighten his morose brothers mood.  “Soul, ya bag of maggots, why can’t you for once, step in here with a bloody smile!”, Itno said with candor.  To that statement the whole host raised a glass and generally cheered Itno on in his quest.  Soulshiver, at their comic display couldn’t help but smile to the which the crowd cheered on and Dohpaz, thus encouraged, summoned more beer for his thirsty friends.  Seeing that he would quickly lose his friends attention to Dohpaz’s summoning Art, Soulshiver leapt to a tabletop and said, “My friends, I’ve dire news.”  The crowd fell silent as they knew that Soulshiver was about some serious business.  Even Dohpaz and Thorvan fell silent in an awkward embrace that left Dohpaz hanging in a spectacular gnome wedgie.  “Brothers, Sisters, I’ve come upon some dire tidings…one of our own…” Soulshiver hesitated as carefully hidden emotions choked and constricted his throat, “Centuri…has been taken by force by one of my Household Dy’Truin.  This capture of our Sister should have been easily foreseeable.  Yet, as many of you know, I’ve been at odds with myself selfishly seeking answers when they’ve been so readably available to me.  Due to my actions, or lack of them, I’ve enabled, perhaps, our greatest enemy to capture one…loved…by us.”  Zarius, a stern expression on his face, asked, “Soulshiver, what do you know?  What can you tell us?  More importantly what are we going to do?”  At those questions the guildhall erupted into shouts of vengeance, plans for slaughter, and a call for arms.  Soulshiver sighed inwardly as he knew then that his feelings were justified; his Family would stand by him.  Soulshiver loudly cleared his throat, “Circle, though somehow, I’ve allowed this tragedy to happen, I will not allow this effort to bring ruin to our dear friend and to our great Guild.  I know this Enemy.  I know what he wants.  I know how he thinks he will get it…yet, I’ve a surprise for that bucket of puss, the Gods have granted for me as a brother.  A surprise to the like that Norrath has yet to see, Blood Circle united with all strengths common.  I need maps of Neriak and the missing companions of our host, gathered.  Dohpaz, summon something stimulating…its gonna be a long night.”<br>
<br>
The plan was much debated but was finally decided thus:<br>
<br>
The invasion of Neriak would consist of 3 parts.  One a group lead by Kamal, the guilds ugliest and only Troll would with Kkallel, the guilds smelliest and only Ogre would besieges the front gate and the Neriaks Foreign Quarter with spiderlings, skeletons, bears, and any other common creature in Netkolus Forest.  The pandemonium, Kamal assured everyone, would be spectacular, much like his 166th birthday in Feerott where half of the town and most of the swamp had actually burned, despite the downpour of the rain that was present that day.  After creating the mayhem that we hoped they would create, they were to lodge themselves at the bar and get smashing drunk, enough so that they would have the constant eye of every guardsman in a 10 mile radius.  Secondly, a force consisting of Soulshiver, Itno, Gofar, Avaya, Abbyss, and Hinamar would assault the Hall of the Dead visibly in search of Centuri.  This group was founded under much debate, for Soulshiver was certain, that though Fergussen with the help of Anouris and Abbyss tracked Centuri to its depths, would not be there.  In fact, Soulshiver was certain that  she would be far away from its location, and that we would not be unable to locate Centuri’s position at all until the trap set in the Hall of the Dead had been sprung.  The idea, which was to no one’s liking, was that the 6 set off on their suicidal plunge into the Hall of Dead, lasting for as long as they could before Gofar set off an evacuation, leaving Soulshiver behind to whatever devices he could devise.  He assured them that he would be able to feign his death long enough for his brother to arrive.  And thus enters our 3rd group consisting of Thorvan, Masius, Morbidon, Kannushi, Utaldain, and Fergussen.  Soulshiver believed that when the word of the attack came to Tyvlain, he’d set out at once to collect his brother.  He’d readily believe that Blood Circle would leave one of their own behind after the foiled and Centuri-less expedition led to failure.  Better yet, Soulshiver felt that the forces his brother could have collected for this entrapment might be sufficient to have slain any normal group of adventurers.  Fergussen was to track and locate Tyvlain the moment he left his place of hiding, as Soulshiver was once again certain that that was where she would be kept.  The sole goal of the 3rd group was to, under Invisibility, find Centuri, slay her immediate captors, and have Masius gate the entire group to a predetermined location.  The plans were gone over and over again, ‘til every detail had been firmly embedded with every participant.  When the confidence came that they have covered everything, the entire Circle prepared equipment that would be needed for the assault.  After a magical circle of protection had been set on the Hall, the Guild took to their favorite sleeping spots and fell as if dead.  However, though Soulshiver had to took to his bed, at an appointed hour he crept silently back to the common room.  Itno, Anouris, Xairious, Grendul, Blacko, and Utaldain silently awaited him.  “Dark Brothers, thank you for meeting me at this hour.  It is our hour truly, isn’t it?” Soulshiver said with an evil grin.  The gathered assembly smiled and nodded their agreement.  “Anouris, Xairious, Grendul, and Blacko- you are group four. When my brother comes to gloat over my corpse, it will not take him long to realize my ruse.  He will undoubtedly take me to my ancestral home to take my Birthright on our Honored Arena.  I’ve my doubts that this will be a fair combat, but this is not my concern.  As Blacko and Utaldain know, I am three days for the time that I must assume my position on the Dark Council.  I must renounce all in service to Neriak and our Lord, Innoruuk.  I must assume my Title as the Duke of the Dark and enjoy the power and privileges accorded to my Rank.  This…does not sit well with me.  I’ve had turbulent thoughts considering this matter, yet my heart is decided.  I will refute my claim to my Father’s Title and renounce my name Dy’Truin.”  This news was accepted with shock from Blacko and Utaldain, whose own families were of some of the Great Houses of Neriak.  Utaldain exclaimed, “Give up you name?!  Soulshiver, you’ve gone mad!!”  Blacko, equally disturbed said, “Brother, she is only a Elf! A paladin at that!!  Don’t get me wrong, Bro, she’s worth attention…but give up your Name?!  Your Title?!  By Innoruuk’s poisoned breath, give your bloody Title to me!!”  Itno, quietly said, “Brothers, matters of the heart are complicated ones.  Soulshiver is entitled to his feelings, certainly if his love for Centuri is reciprocated, we could all call Soulshiver a lucky elf.”  To this the trio of rogues added their agreement.  Utaldain had overcome his initial shock, but Blacko was visibly suffering.  “Peace, Brother, I wish I had the power to explain her meaning to me…yet, such words escape me as they have never been uttered.  Just trust me.”  Blacko, to his credit, nodded and gave his assent.  “Yours will be the task, Brothers, to ensure that I’ve some moments alone with my brother.  I will, I fitfully pray, have some others that will witness what I’ve to say to that worthless whelp.  Be ready, for I will be in dire need of the strength of your arms.  Now please, Anouris, do me a favor and poison my drink with a sleeping draught.  I fear I will be needing it this night, for on the morrow Brothers, we prove Blood Circle…”<br>

As if that was possible…<br>
These two idiots couldn’t even tell that she was healing herself as they were dragging her off to this morning’s torture session.  She was sing-songing the tinyest of healing prayers in the high-elven toungue. Over and over and over she whispered the words of healing.  It took a lot out of her but the healing came.  More importantly, her casting wasn’t noticed.  She felt her ribs knit and took a deep breath for the first time in what seemed like ages.  She was now able to open both of her eyes and her ankle would now support her weight as well.  The constant pain receeded into a dull, stubborn throbbing ache.  She sighed.  It was enough.  It was more than enough.<br>
<br>
Where were these idiot guards taking her?  As they trudged down hallway after hallway, the opulent decadence of the decorations increased.  A suspicion began to form in her mind and was solidified as they paused before one particular door. <br>
The design on the door exactly matched the pattern on her breastplate. (Idly, she wondered what had become of her weapons and armor.)  A design that she now recognized as the Dy’Truin family crest.  Tyvlain Dy'Truin’s Quarters!  Sweet Mother!  What was he planning to do to her next?<br>
<br>
The maggot was absolutly determined to see her groveling at his feet.  The lustful way he watched during the torture sessions he inflicted upon her made her stomach roil.  It was almost a good thing that he hadn’t really fed her in days.  The lack of food, the lack of sleep, the constant pain, she reminded herself that they were all just minor discomforts and that she had been trained to withstand them.  A Paladin must be able to endure, to fight with broken bones and mortal wounds. To protect the Cleric in her charge at all costs.   <br>
So, She controlled the panic, pushed back the fear…. she could endure any torture he devised.  Especially since he was not permitted to kill her…. yet.<br>
<br>
He wanted to see her in submission far more than he wanted her dead, anyway.  Tyvlain was determined to take all that was his older brother’s. Soulshiver's title, lands, servants, everything.  Soulshiver's life as well, could he but take his brother by surprise.  Well, the little leech would never have HER!  She smiled at the remembered fury in his eyes when she had spit in his face.  It was entirely possible that the Dark Master's presence at that session was the only thing that saved her from the death in his eyes. <br>
Her continued defiance must just eat at him.  Centuri was positive that it was not something he had much experience in dealing with.  Who in their right mind would defy the orders of a member of the house of Dy’Truin?  Well, let’s see what he has in mind for today.<br>
<br>
The heavy doors opened upon a  large, well-appointed sitting room, heavily decorated in red, black and gold.  A large chair sat in the middle of the room.  It was only one small step away from being called a throne. Tyvlain was sitting upon it with a smile of welcome on his face that immediately set off every danger alarm Centuri had.<br>
She stepped cautiously into the room, the chains on her ankles chiming against the marble floor.  Just as she was about to say something cutting about his choice in decorations, her eyes were drawn to movement in a shadow to one side of the chair. A small figure in rags huddled there.  <br>
<br>
Centuri’s eyes widened in shock.  The fiend’s horrible plan for this morning’s session crystallized in brilliant, horrible detail and her heat sank at what she knew would be the ultimate outcome…<br>
She would not be able to withstand him this time.  <br>

As Centuri’s eyes searched the little one’s face, her heart sank.  This one was no longer whole in spirit or mind.  Tyvlain had accomplished with this little girl what he tried to do with her.  The blank, vacant expression spoke of one who had seen too much.  This child’s spirit had been totally broken.<br>
Centuri trembled slightly as pent-up memories of fire and the sounds of screams threatened to engulf her.  But for the Mother’s grace, SHE might have been this child.<br>
<br>
An evil chuckle brought her attention back to Tyvlain.  The self-satisfied smirk on the Tier’dal Assassin’s face hit Centuri like a bucket of water from the oceans of Iceclad.  He had read every thought as it passed across her face.<br>
<br>
She ruthlessly suppressed the memories again, collecting her thoughts and schooling her expression into blank neutrality.  The dark one’s evil grin widened.<br>
Hey toyed with a small, golden dagger, twirling it idly between his fingers.  “You know what I want, young Paladin, why do you continue to waste my time by fighting? You are only delaying the inevitable.  Why don't you just give it to me?”<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  Because you’re a scum-sucking, demon-spawned, son of a sarnak and you don’t deserve to draw breath in my presence, much less demand concessions of me!</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
She remained silent.<br>
<br>
After a long moment, he sighed.  “ You truly are the most exasperating of females.  I don’t know what my brother sees in you.”<br>
He began to stroke the little girl’s hair and he drew her closer to him as he continued to speak to Centuri.<br>
“I did some research after my brother’s rather alarming display of temper.  Killing three of the Dark Masters over a couple of slaves?  Frankly, I was rather bewildered by his behavior until I found the origin of those two slaves.”<br>
Centuri fought to keep her expression blank as the memories swirled up form the depths once more.<br>
“It seems they came from a raid on a small village in the Faydark many years ago.  Now, I was already investigating the rumors of Soulshiver’s recent aberrant behavior over a certain Paladin of Tunare.  You will never guess what I discovered! You originally came from the same village as those two slaves.  Imagine my surprise!”  He laughed.<br>
Centuri seethed.  He was truly enjoying this moment, dragging it out as long as possible.<br>
“What a frightened child you must have been.”<br>
<br>
“Get to your point, Tyvlain,” she growled through clenched teeth.<br>
<br>
He frowned at her familiar address. “Very well, here it is then.  You will submit to me, obey my every order and command or this child will die right now.”  He placed the point of the thin blade under the little girl’s jaw.  Her eyes widened slightly as the comprehension of her imminent death seeped through the layers of blankness she had wrapped her broken soul in.  As Centuri met her eyes, a tiny spark of comprehension lit for just one, short moment.  Then, it was gone, smothered once more.  Centuri closed her eyes for one moment to keep the tears from dropping and steeled her heart against what she must do. If this was the worst he could do, he would fail again. <br>
She looked straight at the Dy’Truin lordling and said “No.”<br>
<br>
He shrugged, and with a small, practiced movement of his wrist, cut the little girl’s throat.  Centuri watched the light drain from her eyes as her life drained away on the floor in a crimson puddle.  Full of shock and horror that he would truly do such a callous thing, Centuri whispered a prayer to the Mother, asking that She might gather in the broken child and bring her to peace at last.<br>
Tyvlain sighed as he wiped the little blade clean on a linen napkin and stepped over the body on the floor. “Very well, we shall continue this conversation elsewhere.”  He snapped his fingers and the Orc guards were quick to hustle her off down the corridors after him.<br>

Once more in the slave pens, this time on the outside.  The tiny faces of children peered out at her.  Human, dwarf and others among the elves.  These were the pens that held the children…Her heart sank as she looked at those small faces.  Many of them still held hope in their eyes.  She knew his dastardly plan, now.  Her life was sacrosanct for the moment; he must keep her alive.  But, he could, and would, slaughter every other captive in the Halls of the Dead to get what he wanted – Her.<br>
He leaned over her shoulder and she could feel his hot breath in her ear as he spoke.<br>
“Their fates are in your hands now, my dear.  Do as I command and they may spend their lives in the mines.  Or, if you refuse me again, they will experience all the delights of the Dark Master’s research.  I have no need to be careful with their pathetic little lives so I assure you, their deaths will be quite drawn out and painful.  Moreover, my dear, YOU will watch every one of those sessions.  There will be no stopping, no halt, no mercy.  Not even if you beg at that point.  Not until this pen is empty.  Now, this is your only opportunity to save them from that fate…”<br>
<br>
A wave of pure loathing for the younger Dy’Truin son welled up and threatened to overwhelm her completely.  So powerful she could actually feel it echo down the twin-bond to her sister.  <br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Danger. That way lies danger, young Paladin…</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Choice? There was no choice.<br>
Swallowing her pride, she concentrated on the small children for whom she was making this sacrifice.  Reminding herself that self-sacrifice is a Paladin’s duty.  To protect the innocent.  But, oh! How it made her burn with anger….<br>
Slowly, she sank to her knees in front of Tyvlain Dy’Truin and looked down at the floor.  She choked out the words that she had refused to say throughout unspeakable tortures.  <br>
“Master,……how. May. I. Serve. You?”<br>
<br>
Self-loathing for her own perceived cowardice, for she could not watch those children die, amplified her growing, obsessive, hate for Soulshiver’s brother.<br>
<br>
Hate, a dangerous emotion for an elf in Innoruuk’s Halls.<br>
<br>
Deep within his fastness, Innoruuk tasted of the sweet, little elf and smiled.  This one too, would become one of his…<br>
