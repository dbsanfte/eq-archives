<br>
Chapter 1 The Beginning<br>
<br>
Two parents stood side by side amazed at the letter they had just received from the Heartwood Master in Kelithin. He was requesting their youngest daughter be sent for training in the skill of Druids.. Mother Tunare had requested it be so. They had no choice in the mater it was send their youngest off to the Solders of Tunare or face shame and outcast amongst their own kind. Mother Tunare requested her..<br>
<br>
Why not Kinned her older brother, more suited to be a ranger. Or her older sister Lillieeanna she hand the sense to stay out of trouble at least...Nothing left to do but send Katreena to meet the Heartwood Master.. Surely he would see she was not suited to anything requiring so much attention, study and practice. She was too easily distracted and tended towards getting lost or adventuring to far into the forest by any small thing, to wander off at a whim. Still there it was Mother Tunare Requested her training..<br>
<br>
Meager supplies were packed.. then to tell Kat she what was requested of her... <br>
<br>
&quot;Mother, I'm here sorry to be late I, I just saw the most amazing thing in the forest and had to go see..&quot; words hung in the air as Katreena looked at her mother, &quot;Is something wrong? You've been crying!&quot; Mother took Katreena's hand and held them to her face. You have to leave I have packed some things here, food, water.. Now is the time for you to be on your own..&quot; Kat looked in stunned amazement, &quot;What, I can't leave. Why, where is everyone?&quot; &quot;Go see your father&quot; was all she could say as she brushed Kat's Hair from her face, tears streaming down, words choked in her throat. She leaned to kiss her child's forehead one last time, could stand the pain no more and turned away. She muttered &quot;Kat, do honor to us all in this and please please stop wandering off&quot; No more was said as sobbing soon turned into a storm of mournful yet stifled cries. Her mother left the room.<br>
<br>
Confused she took the things her mother had packed and stepped into the kitchen.. Her father was there, funny he had never looked so tired or can it be said old. He looked worn from the days tasks. He bid Kat to sit down in the chair next to him. He smelled of herbs and earth. He put his arms around Kat as he stood behind her. Laid on the table was a Note, tear stained and tattered at the edge. He put his arms around her and smelled her hair as he had done almost every day since she was a small girl. &quot;Read this&quot; his said. His shaking hand pointed to the note on the table.<br>
<br>
It is hereby Ordered By the Heartwood Master, Lord and Leader of Soldiers of Tunare, that Katreena will be sent to me for training in the study and art of Druid as soon as possible, in the city of Kelethin As so requested by Mother Tunare. She is to present this note to me upon arrival. <br>
<br>
Eyes now wide in amazement and surprise, Kat looked at the note turned it over and saw the broken seal of the Heartwood Master. Beside the note 2 books and 2 parchments.<br>
<br>
Father now said &quot;One book is a spell book. In which to scribe all of your spells. There are two here to learn on the way to the Heartwood Master. The other you must read and decide which path you are to follow. Mother Tunare will guide you&quot;. Speechless, Kat turned to her father who now had tears welling up in his eyes. &quot;Kat, you are not to continue in your wandering ways this is serious now. What you do from now on will either bring shame or fortune to this family. As judged by Mother Tunare, herself.&quot; He again leaned over and said &quot;Follow what the Master says, do your best, return to us safe when you can&quot; Then one more time admonished her &quot;Please Kat keep your mind on what tasks you must do, no more wandering off&quot;. <br>
<br>
Both Father and Mother now stood at the door, he looking worried and old, she leaning on him for strength and comfort, eyes swollen and red from crying. I looked back and my heart ached to stay, but adventure had finally call me. With that I turned and headed in the direction of Kelithin. <br>
<br>
CHAPTER 2 Heartwood Master<br>
<br>
No sooner had I gone out of sight of my home was I teleported to a deck high above the ground, in a tree. Stunned I stood for a moment turning around and around. <br>
What was this, where was I and how?? My eyes open with excitement I asked everyone &quot;Where is this, where am I&quot;. Most just looked at me as if I were crazy others said &quot;Kelethin&quot; as if I should have known.<br>
<br>
I wandered over this ramp, over that deck, looking at and enchanted by everything and everyone. Never had I seen so many different peoples or shops with so many wares. I had long since forgotten why I was there and who had sent for me.<br>
<br>
I found myself fatigued and lost. It was then I pulled out my food and water, to find the letter.. &quot;Oooh No, I had done it again wandered off&quot;. Angrily I scolded myself. <br>
<br>
I asked for assistance from one and all who passed by me. &quot;Where can I find the Heartwood Mater, please, he is expecting me&quot;. Finally another wood elf saw my plight and came to my rescue. He lead me across swinging bridges, decks and ramps till at last I stood in front of the doors to the Soldiers Of Tunare. I thanked him profusely, and turned to go inside.<br>
<br>
I entered. There inside to greet me were several people most of whom wore scowls upon their faces, staring at me.<br>
I could offer only my humble apologies for not coming sooner. Over to the left stood a man who's wisdom shone clearly in his eyes. He had the look of a great man of experience and nobility. His voice was commanding yet gentle &quot;Come here, young wood elf&quot;. I passed under the glares of the others and stood in front of him and gave him the note with a shaky hand. <br>
<br>
A grin crossed his face for just a second and then the stern look returned. &quot;So, you are Katreena. Let's have a look and see if you are&quot;. The others now spoke up &quot;She was teleported here hours ago Master. One who shows so little respect should be sent back home and shame should be brought down upon her family.&quot; <br>
<br>
The Heartwood Master held up his hand silencing all voices there. He then lifted my chin up so that I looked into his eyes.. My face burned, my eyes welling up with tears, hurt by my shame. He wiped the tears from my cheeks and looked deeply into my eyes. <br>
<br>
I felt everything slip away as his gaze looked deep into the very soul of me. He spoke his word swirling around my head &quot;Ah, although she is not the usual student we have seen, Mother Tunare has requested her to be trained in the ways of the Druid. Who are we to question Mother Tunare. I will be in charge of her training myself&quot;. <br>
<br>
Smiling at me now he said,&quot;Begin your training now, young wood elf&quot;. He gave me a club and showed me how to handle it. Then asked to see the spells I had scribed, showed me the ways in which to cast them. &quot;Go now, practice your skills in the woods near by. Let Mother Tunare guild you in all things. Return to me for future training&quot; he said smiling. He then sent me on my way.<br>
<br>
CHAPTER 3 The Beginning of a Druid<br>
I was still a bit confused by the Heartwood Master accepting me for training, what had he seen in my eyes, my soul? Why had Mother Tunare sent for me? Questions that to this day remain unanswered.<br>
<br>
Quickly and most carefully I made my way to the lift that would take me to the forest floor. The guards I passed on the way would look at me and then dismiss me without another thought. At last the lift, I watched the many people get on and off. I walked forward warily and stood there waiting for the lift to go down. &quot;Humm, how does this work&quot; no sooner had the thought crossed my mind than the lift moved downward. It came to a stop at the ground and I moved off.<br>
<br>
I looked around there and to the left stood a dark figure. I was filled with fear as I passed him. There were several bodies at his feet. His demeanor made me move off all the faster up and over a small hill that opened out on to a clearing. <br>
<br>
There I stood at the top of this hill looking out on small battles others were having with the fauna. Armed with only the club and my spells I too set out to hone my skills. I was so nervous and unsure I looked for a small animal to kill, a bat. I cast Skin of Wood for a shield, surprised it worked. <br>
<br>
I chose my target and swung, eyes closed, hope filled my heart that I would not die. I found myself being attacked back by the creature. It was surprisingly strong and I was fighting not just for the experience, but my life. The battle seamed to take forever, but in reality only a few moments had passed. It was over the bat lay crumpled at my feet, my health all but gone, I had won. <br>
<br>
I picked up my prize and then turned to heal myself. It took all the mana I had and I was only half healed. I sat to regain mana and watched again the battles around me.<br>
<br>
The action was for the most part non stop as young wood elves, half elves, gnombs and more all chasing down their targets, each one having their own skill to learn. Some clumsily, like myself, fought. Others like dancers with grace and precision. I watched and was soon practicing the skills of the more graceful ones, hoping somehow to attain their skills. <br>
<br>
Many times throughout the day I repeated the steps.. Cast shield, fight and kill my target.. heal myself and rest.. again and again for hours collecting small prizes of pelts, wings, bone chips, rusty weapons and more. I would break only to sell those treasures and lighten my pack. <br>
<br>
Soon exhausted I sat down to look at the red book my father had given me. The words seemed a threat to me more than a choice, it was clear the path that I would take.. I through the book in a fire and hoped no one would find the likes of it again. <br>
<br>
Then back to the lessons that only doing battle would teach me. I was close to the edge of the clearing on the far side when a gracious wood elf stopped at my side. She smiled at me, &quot;young wood elf you have done well, but you need clothing and a better weapon. I have been watching you and your courage has been shinning brightly&quot;. She then gave me a savants cap and cloth gloves. I knelt at her feet and gave humble thanks for her generous gifts. Then as quickly as she appeared she left. <br>
<br>
There I stood mouth agape, eyes wide in wonder and my heart leaping for joy. I carefully inspected the items, &quot;Oh my, I thought I would never be able to repay her, and what was her name&quot; stunned and shocked by this act of kindness I felt tears welling up in my eyes. I took a break and decided to go to the Heartwood Master and see if I had need of further training. <br>
<br>
I stood on the lift to the city above, waited and waited puzzled I jumped up and down, got on and off, what was this, it had always just worked never before had it not.. I asked &quot;Is the lift broken?&quot; &quot;No&quot;, came the reply. &quot;Oh&quot;, I said shyly looking for the reason it would not move. Then a young gnome came up laughing &quot;Silly girl, you press this button and there is one at the top. Where are your brains&quot;. My face must have been very flushed, &quot;I'm sorry&quot; he said more kindly &quot; thought everyone knew about this&quot;. &quot;No&quot; I said softly and shook my head we have nothing like this at home. The lift took us up and stopped, I thanked the gnome and quickly moved away from his sight. &quot;Stupid girl&quot; I scolded myself &quot;Why couldn't I have figured that out for myself&quot;.<br>
<br>
Off to the merchants and then to the bank I carefully went. I put every copper I had collected in my account it had grown to more money than I had ever seen 8 gold pieces in all.<br>
<br>
I then went to see the Heartwood Master. I opened the doors and went in quietly as I could not wishing to draw attention to myself. Another young elf was there training so I sat and watched carefully the lessons he was learning.<br>
<br>
Soon it was my turn and I stood before the Man, the master, trainer. I had gained enough experience to train for 10 sessions. He asked &quot;what do you want to know young Katreena. You have done well and I am pleased with your efforts&quot;. I stood there, choices? &quot;Oh my&quot; I was and wasn't ready to learn.. what should I do? I excused myself and left quickly.. outside I sat and thought long and hard, I prayed &quot;Mother Tunare lead me please, I don't know what it is I need to know&quot;. Tears welled up again in my eyes, &quot;I was surely not meant to be a druid&quot; I thought.<br>
<br>
I passed the Champions of Faydark and went in thinking &quot;Maybe just maybe there would be one there that could help me, give me a bit of advice&quot;. Mother Tunare had lead me there with kindness there were those that would help. &quot;You first need to buy these spells. See here, these are the ones you need&quot; she said kindly. <br>
<br>
I quickly went to the bank, pulled out every last copper and returned buy the two that I could afford, Snare and Burst of Flame. I quickly found a quiet spot to scribe them in my spell book and put them to memory. Then off to the Heartwood Master I had need for training now. <br>
<br>
I went in, stood in front of him and asked for training in Alteration and Evocation.. as well as more 1 hand blunt. &quot;You have chosen wisely, Katreena.&quot; he had the look my father got when I had done something that pleased him.<br>
<br>
Then he said &quot;It is time for you to quest young druid.. We may not use blades they are forbidden by Mother Tunare I wish to rid the land of these vile things. Therefore, I need you to bring me 1 rusty blade each of the following: A bastard sword, a short sword, a long sword and a broad sword. You will be rewarded when you return with these items. Go Katreena and bring pride to us the Soldiers of Tunare, young druid&quot;. I vowed not to fail, and left ready to try my new spells and hone my skills once again.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Chapter 3 In Training<br>
<br>
<br>
I stopped at the bank to place the few coppers left in my account. I was moving through the city with light easy steps, more quickly than ever. However, I must have been lost in my head for I was lost again, &quot;Was it left here or right? over this ramp or that bridge?&quot; I wandered around again over and over trying to find my way. <br>
<br>
I came upon a large barrel and thought &quot;I needed to refill my water I opened it up and it said combined. I put my waters into the barrel and did just that. They were gone,&quot; This could not be good&quot; I had no water, now. I scolded my self for my ignorance &quot;Foolish girl, you still haven't learned anything&quot;.<br>
<br>
After much roaming, I found my way to a lift down. Not one that I had been at before, but a lift just the same. &quot;Oh to feel ground under my feet again&quot; I wished to myself. Then before going down I shouted out &quot;Anyone have extra water. In desperate need of water, Please&quot;. <br>
<br>
A young man stepped up to me and asked what had happened to my rations. &quot;What have you done with your supplies?&quot; Shy and embarrassed I explained my fool hearty attempt to get water from the barrel. He smiled and said &quot;Don't be to hard on yourself, you learned a valuable lesson, yes? You will not repeat it again, I hope&quot; &quot;Oh, yes&quot; I said shyly. He then looked at my equipment, &quot;Here I have plenty of water and food and you will need this as well&quot;. He gave me water and food, 5 platinum and a Great Worn Staff. &quot;You know what to do with these right&quot;. <br>
<br>
Stunned and stuttering &quot;Oh, yes I do believe so. You are so kind,thank you very much, sir&quot;. I bowed to him as he left me there. My heart ached with joy as another kind person had done me a great favor and expected nothing in return. &quot;Was this Mother Tunare?&quot; It seemed to me to be so.<br>
<br>
I return to the floor of the forest and proceeded to use my new spells and skills. It was wonderful the snare spell meant no more chasing the Burst of Flame gave me the advantage I so badly needed in my battles. The things I chose became increasingly easier to kill. <br>
<br>
Every once in a while I would take out that Great Staff and polish it, hold it swing it. Clumsily at first, I knew then the direction of my next training sessions with the Heartwood master. <br>
<br>
It was on one of these breaks that I stopped to look around. &quot;Oh, my where am I? The lift was right there, no over there. Damn!&quot; I had done it again I was lost. This time nothing seemed right. No trail, no lights, no familiar land marks and it was getting dark and starting to rain.<br>
<br>
Just then a most wondrous and beautiful thing flew by, a small, multi colored dragon. So delicate and enchanting I followed, not thinking of the dangers I might be wandering into. <br>
<br>
It was not long before I came across a horrid looking creature large sulking shoulders, blue grey green in color I had seen smaller ones in the meadow earlier but this was much larger and had a look of some wild sick animal. I hailed him hoping him to be friendly, he turned and grunted then charged. I knew not to waste time, but turned and ran, but to where, which way &quot;Just run&quot; I said &quot;pray that I might live through this&quot; <br>
<br>
I stumbled into the mist of a camp of them &quot;Oh, No&quot; I heard myself cry. I saw others on a hill fighting more of them I Yelled for Help. Only to have two more beast turn and start to chase me as well. I was in deep trouble now and could only run to the groups doing battle there. <br>
<br>
It was then a strong looking huge man stepped in swinging and axe that was much bigger than I was. He took down one quickly and then another. He took some blows so I healed him quickly as best I could. The last of the beast fell, He bent down and collected the loot from the dying bodies. He stood up and Looked at me, your way too young to be hunting in these parts, miss. His smile turned into a chuckle as he inspected me. Your a child, come follow me I will take you back to a safe place. <br>
<br>
I followed closely like a puppy tagging along after him. I felt safe behind this Warrior,if that is what he was. His face bore blue paint and he clothes where of ring mail. &quot;Here we are young one. You go that way to the safe area&quot;. He pointed to the Lift. &quot;Oh, don't I get a hug for my heroism&quot; Shyly I stood up on my toes hugged him modestly. &quot;Here beautiful one&quot; He gave me a necklace of cat eye, &quot;You should have many such gifts, to match your beauty&quot; I blushed &quot;Thank you so very much I said, you have been a true hero. May Mother Tunare Bless your travels&quot;. I turned quickly and ran to the lift. <br>
<br>
Finally in the new recruit training area again I went to work, killing skeletons embarrassed by my early adventure. I had a lot of stress to work off but unfortunately this area did not provide enough experience to further my training and not enough challenge to keep my interest. I soon wandered off on a trail. Thinking that I would be somewhat safe this way and I may find something new. <br>
<br>
Sure enough I came upon a strangely built formation 4 spires and it was in the middle of no where. I looked around and asked about the meaning of such a place. Someone near by mentioned this was a teleport ring?? &quot;Yes I asked eagerly and what or who does it teleport&quot; I had heard many people shout for a teleport but not once had I guessed that this is what they met. I stood in the center and shouted &quot;Teleport?? nothing happened humm how did this thing work&quot;. The few that were there started laughing, finally someone explained that this was the wizards teleport ring and only wizards could use it. <br>
<br>
Again Embarrassed, I set off on the trail back to Kelethin, or so I thought. I found at the end of a trail a beautiful city in the side of a mountain. I spent the day wandering, talking with all who would answer my questions. I found a person who wanted mail delivered to the bard guild in Kelithin it seemed a small task and there was mention of a reward for my efforts. Greedy for any chance for experience or cash I took on this task.<br>
<br>
Running along the trail back to Kelethin I once again happened upon the Beautiful flying drake. I couldn't resist the temptation to follow so off I went. &quot;Oops&quot;, not a good idea because I was soon lost. &quot;Which way had I come from&quot; Now along comes a big Orc Centurion, I hid hoping he would not sense me there. Luck would have it that he passed by me so close that I could smell the stench of his breath. <br>
<br>
Okay I was lucky that time Mother Tunare was with me and keeping me safe, but I was still lost. Wandering the woods this way and that I was soon in danger again. This time my skill in hiding would not protect me. I cast Snare on one of the Orcs hoping to buy time only to be brought down by another. &quot;How many hits had I taken one, two maybe three? Then I was a dead druid&quot;. This would become my rule in battle. <br>
<br>
Mother Tunare returned me to the Newbie Training area as it is called. I now had to find my body and retrieve the most precious gifts. But which way.. I had food and water restored but otherwise I was as naked as the day I had arrived here. Okay I was at a city named Felwithe I could start there. Let see I had taken a trail to the &quot;Wizard Spires&quot; then on the the City.<br>
<br>
Soon I was there I headed out on the trail I though I was last on then wandered in circles, ever larger looking for the small body that was mine lost in the woods. I came upon a young man in robes and asked it he had seen my body? <br>
<br>
&quot;No, but I will help you find it&quot;. He said grinning at me. &quot;Follow me, I am a Necromancer and have a talent for locating corpses&quot;. &quot;Oh?? Thank you for your time and help I replied&quot;, Off we ran through the forest. &quot;He asking me how I had lost my life being so young&quot;. I of course replied with my usual &quot;Foolish young girl looking for adventure and finding it&quot;.<br>
<br>
Soon we were standing beside my body I quickly collected my things again giving thanks for his kindness. I asked what I could do to repay him &quot;Nothing, it has been a pleasure to help you. Now go that way back to Kelethin&quot;<br>
He pointed &quot;and be careful you should stay close to the druid ring in the Newbie area till your skills have matched your curiosity for adventure&quot;. <br>
<br>
Off I went attentively, looking into each shadow for any dangers that may be lurking there. I made it back safely to the newbie area. &quot;Okay, boring as this might be to be here I would not venture out till I had more training which required more experience. Oh, Yes! I have that letter to deliver to the Bard Guild&quot; I quickly made my way there turning in my letter to the requested person receiving experience and silver for my efforts. <br>
<br>
Returning to the forest floor and to the druid ring there I took up battle with the skeletons that roamed there. Finding on them the requested Swords for the Heartwood Master's quest. I quickly had three of the 4 swords and experience was climbing, too. <br>
<br>
It seemed that I spent days hunting for that last sword I started thinking that perhaps I should just buy the last one and be done with the quest. But, no one would sell me one &quot;Is it for the Quest they would ask?&quot; &quot;Yes&quot; I would reply, &quot;Then go kill skeletons you need the experience girl&quot;. So I did again and again hunting down and killing them each time it became easier and easier. Finally the Sword dropped from one of them and I quickly returned to the Heartwood Master to turn them in. <br>
<br>
It was here that I had my very first meeting with a thief. I had tried to give the swords to The Heartwood Master only to have them drop on the floor a stranger was behind me and picked them up as they dropped. I was crushed, I had worked so hard to collect them and now he stood there ignoring me and simply took them I begged and pleaded with him, to no avail. <br>
<br>
Nothing left to do but to go do the quest again. It took me several more days to compleat the quest. This time I was extremely guarded in giving them to the Heartwood Master. A Scimitar was my reward as well as experience. <br>
<br>
I now could train with the Master again. This time I chose two hand blunt and one hand slashing. As well as furthering my casting skills. I was now in my 5th Leaf and could buy more spells as well. Purchasing all the spells for my level I could now Camouflage, cure poison and disease, Invoke Lightning and Gate. Oh now I could travel quickly back to where I was bound any time.<br>
<br>
I allowed myself some brief practice time with the new spells then I was off to join a group, my first. I went to the area called the Orc Lift and shouted that I was ready to join a group, No response came back. <br>
<br>
I followed the trail back over the knoll there where Orcs crossing here and I chose to take one on. The battle was intense My new spells worked well victory was soon mine. I was Meditating regaining Mana when I saw a young bard pulling I asked if he needed help and much to my delight He invited me into a group of three others. We stayed there pulling down from the tents of Orcs on the hill I healed,d sowed, snared and cast damage spells. We all split the loot and experience. I was so thrilled with how well and fun it was to have someone else to group with. Again and again I would join a group in this area whenever possible and soon was fighting up on Orc hill. <br>
<br>
However, I again became tired of the same old same old and was wandering off on my own. Kat, if you will stay and fight with us you may join but if you wander off take on your own battles don't pull them to us when you can't handle them. So I would venture farther and farther from the camp and would find myself in trouble. I died many a times learning the lessons that fighting alone would teach me. <br>
<br>
I was to be a group fighter, I didn't have the strength the warriors did, or the speed to make a get away that the bards seem to possess, or the powerful damage spells that the casters had. So, a lone fighter I was not meant to be or was I? At the time I had just turned 7th leaf.. <br>
<br>
I was unsatisfied with the killing of the Orcs and decided to leave Kelethin. Time for me to travel and explore I would come back one day, but not now. <br>

<br>
Chapter 1 The Trueshot Bow Quest<br>
<br>
Hearing of the Trueshot Bow quest I set out to compleat it. I knew it was for Paladins, but who cares it was the adventure I was seeking. I set out for Steamfont for the gears I would need. I explored every valley from Kelethin to Lesser Faydark. I discovered a Pixie tower, I found dangerous shadow men, and many more discoveries there in the deep forest.<br>
<br>
I also found a perfect place to worship Mother Tunare, a cool peaceful green glade. It seemed as if she was there herself. Clearing my mind I could Meditate here better than I had ever done. <br>
<br>
I made my way to Steamfont after this with renewed strength. I was soon at the windmill hunting cleaner spiders. I only found one of the gears after what seemed like hours of battle. I being more interested in seeing what was there traveled to Akanon. It was loud and noisy TICK TICK TICK, I quickly left. <br>
<br>
Back out in the open air I traveled the land seeing strange and new beast, Minotaur, Kobolts and more. After my adventures here and collecting the needed gears I returned to Kelethin and put my treasures in the bank. <br>
<br>
I needed to go to Sister Island for Kiola Nuts. I set out for Butcher Block and Kalidim. I would have to spend many days traveling, exploring, seeking out adventure before I came upon this Dwarven City. Then on to the docks to catch the boat that would take me to my destination.<br>
<br>
It was here that I met a young man of the same season as I. He was very impetuous asking me to marry him.. ?? What I said surprised. &quot;I am going to be one of the Famous, The Rich and The Powerful of Norath&quot; he bragged. &quot;You may be my queen&quot;<br>
<br>
I stood back and asked &quot;What?? Sir marriage is for lovers and I am no more than a child. I have been called into the service of Mother Tunare just seven seasons ago now. I have only the love for adventure and service of my Mother Tunare. I hope to one day be a priestess&quot; <br>
<br>
There I had said it &quot;I hoped one day to be a priestess in the service of Mother Tunare?&quot; The words seeking the truth in my heart.. Marriage was not meant for me?&quot; To be a priestess one must be pure of heart, mind, spirit and body. The words surprised even me, was this my destiny? Was this why she had called me so young? Was this what the Heartwood Master had seen? <br>
<br>
I arrived at the docks eagerly awaiting the boat that was to take me to Sister Island and beyond. <br>
<br>
I sat thinking of what had been revealed to me earlier.. &quot;A Priestess?&quot; This would take some time to sort out? Could I ever be happy in just one place. Would I learn to have the faith that was required, the strength, the calm quietness of spirit, mind and soul. Mother Tunare only knew this, look at where she had lead me now? I resigned myself to the fact that only time would tell.<br>
<br>
My thoughts were interrupted by someone shouting &quot;Boat&quot;, I looked up to see a ship docking. Quickly I boarded this vessel and bid Faydwer &quot;Good bye&quot;. <br>
<br>
The Ocean of Tears was vast, the islands we passed contained creatures the likes I had never imagined It seemed to take forever as the day turned into night. I became restless and felt trapped by the confinement of the ship. Just when I could stand it no more the boat docked. at a small Island. I asked &quot;Is this Sister Island&quot;, back came the reply &quot;Yes&quot;.<br>
<br>
Not thinking there might be dangers on this Island I stepped off of the boat. Made it to the end of the dock before I realized there were Pirates here. I quickly moved to the small grouping of huts hoping to find safety there. Here was the reason for the name Sister Island. Here were the women who committed their lives to Mother Tunare. Purity was their symbol, as they wore belts of that name. <br>
<br>
I knowing that I might be lead into the same service asked all I could of them, they remained aloof from the arriving travelers. Strong and fierce they stood watch over the Island and themselves bound together by their beliefs and worship of Mother Tunare yet alone. Again I question my ability to ever become one of them knowing my heart for adventure. <br>
<br>
I purchased a sack full of Koila Nuts to take back to Kaladim to be made into Trumpy Tonics. I then waited at the dock for the next boat to arrive to take me on to Freeport for the last of the needed items to compleat the Trueshot quest. <br>
<br>
The boat came, I boarded her and soon were on our way to Freeport. I couldn't hide it my heart was full of excitement and joy. I sang songs and joked the whole way there I questioned everyone about Freeport and beyond. I'm afraid I was a bit annoying to my fellow travelers, they were a trapped audience on the boat with me. I would bound up and down the decks dancing and laughing like the child I was. By the end of the journey I'm sure they all felt the boat was much to small.<br>
<br>
Freeport came into view beautiful and shining in the days sun. I stood staring eager to get off to explore and adventure. In my innocence I wandered the streets looking in this shop that tavern. So young and wide eyed I took in everything.. <br>
<br>
Then danger! I passed a group of people killing the guards?? My heart pounded I could do nothing to help the guard nor did I understand why people would be so evil as to kill someone who was charged with the protection of the citizens here. I quickly hurried passed asking no questions keeping to myself, hoping no one would stop me or try to fight me. I hung my head in shame for my cowards. <br>
<br>
I finally made it to the bank where I deposited my sacks of Kiola Nuts. Then to purchase food and water, I entered a shop and asked if anyone had seen or knew where I could find Jyle Windshots. This was my question for many an hour. He had the needed Trent wood that I needed to take back to Maesyn Trueshot. I was given the the Rooster roost as his home and could find him there. Little did I know that this was an imposter. He asked for some items that made no sense to me. <br>
<br>
I gated home through the aid of my druid spell to fold time and space. I again asked about the quest, No this was not the right man I was told so of on the adventure again. But this time I stopped at Kalidim to get the necessary Trumpy tonic made and exchanged that for the Dwarven Wire. I repeated my boat trip and found myself at the dock in Freeport again. I quickly searched each and every building again asking where might I find this Jyle Windshots. I finally was told the Hogcallers Inn. There he was and I soon had my prize in hand. Once again gating back to Kelethin I gave the items to Maesyn Trueshot he gave me experience some money and a Trent Staff. <br>
<br>
Chapter 2 A New Land Antontica<br>
<br>
The Quest over, I searched for adventure more close to home. I was now strong enough to do some real damage at Orc Hill and even attempted to go into Crushbone several times to group. But it was all to familar same old stuff. Kill the Orcs. <br>
<br>
It grew wearisome after a while and as you now know I'm not one to stay in one place for long. Off I ventured roaming the land exploring all I could talking with anyone who had an adventure to tell or information to share. <br>
<br>
Soon I was back in Freeport and the area around it. I had nothing else to do but explore and time on my hands to see this world that Mother Tunare had made for me.<br>
<br>
This time out to the Desert of Ro where I met a fellow druid. The first time out she and I met Dorn B Dying and died quickly. I had the impression that he guard would save me but soon learned he was of little use against that Cutthroat.. <br>
<br>
So I learned the subtle art of run like hell from the Mad men, Zombies and Mummies as these creatures would surprise attack. I would be fighting an Orc Raider, snake, puma, or jackal. Just in the mist of battle they would appear and take your life if you didn't react fast enough. Many of times I learned this lesson and many more times did someone come to my aid. We would usually end up laughing about the mishap in the end. I met some very honorable men and women out on the sands.<br>
<br>
Time and again Mother Tunare Blessed me with guardian spirits. Many of whom I will never know their names and some like Minibfang who passed on to me an item of clothing or a weapon. I will never forget their kindnesses to me when I was so young and inexperienced. I learned to pass on to those younger and less experienced as I the same kindnesses shown me. In honor of all those that have in some way helped me.<br>
<br>
I soon learned that there was no place to train with a Druid Master close by. That there were to many dangers involved in going to Rivervale. It was Back to Kelithin, I didn't realize how much I missed being in the trees with the cool sweet grass. At the Dock I met a young druid man who needed a guide to Kelethin. Yaso was of the 7th level and also needed training so we joined together as traveling compainons.Once back home he bought spells and received training as did I. <br>
<br>
Now a 9th Leaf I was ready for even more adventure so Gated back to Freeport to continue my adventure on the Deserts Of Ro. I was now able to join groups to kill the Cutthroat thieves that had camps here. But soon found out that I quickly ran out of mana. I started asking around about how to increase this basic need. Soon I found out of the Skull of Jentra', found only on the planes of Karanas and beyond. I found out that the journey would be filled with many dangers, I had a better chance of dying that making it. <br>
<br>
I soon was preparing myself for the journey foolhardy as it seemed I needed that Skull and the adventure was calling me. &quot;Mother Tunare&quot; I prayed &quot;see fit to guild me in this to complete this task to better serve you.&quot; <br>
<br>
Chapter 3 Farvak<br>
<br>
At last I thought I am ready for the journey, I packed rations and water for the travel. Across the forested valley that was East and West Commons to the pass through Kithicor Wood. I paused and then entered into that dark place. Thinking to myself I was safe because it was day time. I had just sat to memorize camouflage when he came up to me. <br>
<br>
&quot;Hello there. My but you are a lovely little thing&quot;. I felt my face flush and turned my attention to the owner of that very seductive voice. Shyly I said &quot;Thank you. May you have safe and good journeys.&quot; A smile passed his face as he asked &quot;Where are you headed?&quot; I trustingly said to The planes of Karana to obtain a &quot;Skull of Jentra&quot;. He the asked if he could join me on my journey through this forest and make sure I made it safely to High Hold Pass.<br>
<br>
I was more than happy to have an experienced companion to help me through, from what I had heard was one of the most dangerous legs of my journey. We started up the long trail to High hold when he said &quot;Come over here I sense danger nearby&quot;. I quickly and trustingly followed him. Deep into the side of the wood away from the safety of the path.<br>
<br>
We finally stopped at a ruined building. He smilingly said here we would stay till it is safe, I innocently obeyed. We had time for conversation. He asked me many questions simple ones like where I was from, where was my family, who was my God. I answered unguarded and truthfully with an open heart. Then he became personal &quot;Had I ever been in love, had I ever know a lover&quot;<br>
.<br>
I blushed and replied &quot;No. I haven't the time for such things. My service to Mother Tunare has just begun&quot;. He laughed his eyes gleaming strangely. &quot; It is late and we cannot travel these woods at night&quot; he said. &quot;I will keep watch, you need to sleep&quot;<br>
<br>
I trusted him so much, with such blind innocence. I still cringe at my own ignorance. I awoke alone. The woods were always so Dark and not knowing my way or how to get out, where was he?. What had happened to him, I worried. Blood was all around was it his?? I sat there shivering my mind spinning with thoughts of a battle where he was torn to shreds so close begging for help and here I lay sleeping. It seemed as though hours passed and I could not find the courage to move from the spot. <br>
<br>
That was when I hear him call my name &quot;Katreena, your still here girl&quot; Laughingly he came and joined me. I was so relived that he was alive. &quot;What happened to you why is the camp full of blood?&quot; I eagerly questioned. &quot;Oh, that. Give it not a second thought. I am safe and now so are you&quot; His eyes gleamed strangely again. &quot;Here I have some meat to cook we will eat and then head off&quot;. <br>
<br>
It was now that I sensed that something terrible was about to happen or had happened and that I was the cause of it. He was unpacking his back pack when I saw my mothers head roll out. He was watching my face delighted by the terror that was twisting it into screams. &quot;She was all to easy to kill you know&quot; he said smirking. I turned to run and he grabbed my hair and spun me around to look at him. &quot;No I'm not done with you yet, little one.&quot; It was now that I understood his gleaming eyes, all to late it all became so very clear to me. Yelling at him &quot;Why, What did I do, What did they do to deserve this&quot; He replied as he was holding me down and wrapping my hands and feet in cords. &quot;Nothing that's just it&quot; confused and angry I could only stare in shock at his face. <br>
<br>
&quot;Come I have more to show you,&quot; he kept emptying those bags, forcing me to look at each piece as he brought it out. &quot;Your brother was a tough one, here is his heart, he held it out and whispered in my ear. The heart of a young warrior I believe you told me last night&quot;<br>
&quot;Your father on the other hand to easily killed, he was to old for the battle. Here are his eyes, a gift for you, love, so you will always know he is watching you.&quot; Your lovely sister delicious till the end. I do regret having to take her life so soon. I would have liked to taken her to my bed a few more times. But it is you that I want now more than ever. Your fall from innocence, to see your loss of faith and the hate you will allow to build up for Your Mother Tunare. It will consume you and you will serve me well&quot;. <br>
<br>
He commanded the evil things that were close, to come hold me there. I could only watch in terror. He just smiled and slowly undressed me keeping his eyes on mine all the while. &quot;I want to see the loss of innocence, do not turn from me. I will be gentle with you&quot;. He laughed evilly grinning now, his true nature poring from every inch. He coaxed &quot;Yes that is it, you know that all is hopeless now. Your just beginning to understand, humm how wonderful your fall is. No one to care, no one to know It was you who came willingly to my side, girl. You wanted me, maybe not this way but you want me even now your body gives you away. See how you tremble with excitement.&quot; <br>
<br>
Tears ran down my cheeks, terror filled my mind and the grief that was in my heart left me with the longing to die. I pleaded &quot;Kill me now. Have some mercy please&quot;. I screamed at the evil to rip my heart from my body. I begged Mother Tunare to release me from this world. None of that happened. &quot;Was this my punishment from Mother Tunare for being so disobedient, for wandering off so many times, for in my ignorance of youth when I had killed her wolves&quot;.<br>
<br>
He took me time and again. Each time more violent and savage he took great pleasure in torturing me. He would allow me to escape and have the evil around drag me back till I ran no more. Conceding to the fact that he had and would do with me as he pleased.All the time he was enjoying the rise of anger and hate that I would direct towards him.<br>
<br>
Words so vile spoken to me with such distaste. &quot;Katreena, I have soiled myself with you. Your now my whore and you will do as I please, I own you. Your Mother Tunare is no where to help you. She has cast you aside like trash, given you to me&quot;. I vowed time and again no man would ever have me again this way ever if I lived hardening my heart to all. Now, no tears would fall from my eyes. I would weep no more for my loss in front of him. I would deify him at every turn. <br>
<br>
Yet when I was left alone I would cry silently &quot;Mother Tunare why have you done this, what purpose of yours does this suit&quot;. All hope gone I could care no more what my fate may be.<br>
<br>
**************************<br>
<br>
I awoke, aching in a small hut with a young warrior sitting near by. &quot;Ah, your waking up. I thought for sure you would die. You are a strong willed girl&quot; Bitterly I looked at him and demanded &quot;Where am I?&quot; He answered gently &quot;Your in a small village just outside the pass to High Hold&quot;.<br>
<br>
&quot;And what vile evil do you have planed for me.&quot; I asked angry that I wasn't dead. &quot;Whoa! and that is my thanks for saving you?&quot; he replied. &quot;1st off, no one here is going to do anything to you, rest assured milady My name is Bioa, I am a young ranger I hunt these woods they are my home. The evil that had you has been slain. Trust me you are quite safe here. Now rest and regain your strength I will watch over you&quot;. <br>
<br>
Those words only brought back panic and terror. I sat up and spat &quot;NO! I will leave now. No one will ever keep a vigilance over me&quot; but then the room became a blur and I felt myself falling back and into darkness. Time and again I would awaken to this ranger watching over me. <br>
<br>
I would try to get up and leave, not trusting anything he said. But, I found all quickly each time that I was too weak. He would ask questions and I would just sit and stare him down silently. He would pass food to me, I would only take it if and when he moved away. Days had passed and I was Strong enough to leave. But fear kept me inside, I would go to the door open it and stop looking out. He finally said &quot;Let me take you to High Hold and you can journey from there, Please milady&quot; I said only the few words spoken to him in all this time &quot;And what do you want in return for this favor?&quot; He looked hurt but said &quot;Nothing, Lady, to see you on your way&quot;. I accepted that with doubts as he took the lead through the forest I kept him far enough away I could escape, but in view. <br>
<br>
We reached High Hold Pass and parted. &quot;Speedy journeys to you Lady and May Mother Tunare keep you safe&quot;. I angrily looked back and yet managed a &quot;Thank you for your help&quot;. I turned on my heals and never looked back again never wanting to be near Kithicor again.<br>
<br>
<br>
Chapter 4 On to Karanas<br>
<br>
I used camouflage to sneak past the Orc guards at the entrance to High Hold Pass from Kithicor Forest. I put behind me my last few days and pressed onward as if nothing ever had happened. There was nothing left to do but leave it behind me. <br>
<br>
Determined to finish my own quest, to gain the Skull of Jentra for my own. I set my mind to the task of finding the path through High Hold Pass that would take me to the vast planes of Karanas. <br>
<br>
Asking around I finally found someone to lead me through to the correct path down to East Karanas. The 2 men moved quickly however and lost me in the maze of passages. Lucky for me the gnolls there didn't detect me and I was soon following a path down a great mountain into a valley below. I still don't know how I found the right path out I had spent many hours walking in circles when I stumbled upon it. <br>
<br>
It took the better part of a day to reach the bottom. Just as I had a Lion was charging up the hill I again used camouflage to conceal my presents. I looked around as could see that this was not a good place to be there where Griffawns flying around, Gorge hounds, Spiders that were even more fierce than those in the Oasis of Mar, then to add to all this were Cyclopes, and Evil Eyes. <br>
<br>
I quickly moved onward to a small village stopping there only to buy more water. As I came out a Lion Matriarch attacked me I yelled for help as I fought the best I could. Someone took pity on my plight and killed the beast, I thanked them and asked for directions to South Karanas. &quot;Over the Wooden Bridge, move quickly, and be careful&quot; came the reply.<br>
<br>
I followed directions and soon was on the other side faced with new dangers. Borer Beatles, more Lions Highland, Lions, and Griffenes.. Oh I almost stopped and turned around then and there, but my desire for the Skull was greater than my fear. I moved on under the spell of Camouflage to a small gypsy camp there, I didn't delay there it seemed to dangerous to stop. <br>
<br>
I moved Southward to find myself at a Wizard Spire and Stone bridge. It was here that I met fellow travelers and asked if any of them had a Skull of Jentra for sale. None did but told me that I must seek out Lake Rathe and Kill a gnome embalmer. <br>
<br>
I was off again moving south. I gave a wide berth to the skeletons there. Then the most amazing creature passed me a Centaur, half man half horse creature. How wonderful they were, I had only hear tales of such creatures in my youth, never believing they were true, yet here they were. <br>
<br>
Then the ground shook under me, startled and afraid I once again used the camouflage spell to hide with. A great grey mass moved slowly on the horizon as I moved closer I saw it was an Elephant, majestic moving slowly like a ship across the plain. I was in awe of this land it held so much to see and to explore. I vowed to come back when I had the experience to walk among such beast. <br>
<br>
I came across a group on a hill, I asked where I might find the path to Lake Rath.. &quot;Oh and why travel so far from home.&quot; they asked, &quot;Your much to inexperienced to be here&quot;. I stood proudly and said &quot;I have traveled very far to buy a skull of Jentra, I will not leave till I have one&quot;. &quot;Well then You may have need of this&quot; a woman said and gave me a Tunic of Spilt Paw&quot;. I quickly bowed and said &quot;May Mother Tunare bless your journeys and safe health to you all. Thank you Lady, so very much&quot;. <br>
<br>
Again on my way south I came to the Aviak City, where Huge flightless birds dwelled. It was night and I was more than a bit frightened by the battles that were taking place down under the towers of that city in the sky. I shouted out &quot;Anyone Have a Skull Of Jentra for sale&quot;. &quot;Aye&quot; came the reply. A young dark elf quickly found me, once seeing my youth he laughed and said &quot;Here I have one in one of these bags&quot;. He quickly passed it to me I started to pay him, he quickly refused saying your bravery should be rewarded young one, use this wisely and pass it on when you no longer need it. <br>
<br>
Tears now filled my eyes as the generosity of this man was so touching to my soul. I thanked him quite humbly kneeling before him, He simply chuckled and bid me farewell.<br>
<br>
Chapter 5 Lost Faith, Found Faith<br>
<br>
I then used the spell gate to quickly take me back to Freeport to safety. Then to sad memories, I remembered that now I was alone in this world. No one here or in Kelethin to congratulate me on my quest. No one to brush the hair from my face to tell me how foolish I had been. No one to know of the pain I had suffered at the hands of Farvak and defend my now ruined Honor. <br>
<br>
Dreams were now shattered and like dust set upon the winds. I couldn't be a priestess for my Mother Tunare, no more was I pure and chased. I didn't know what She had in store for me. All I knew was I was alone and vowed that I would stay alone until I died.<br>
<br>
I had returned to Kelethin to lay to rest my family. To say good bye to them. To thank them for all they had done for me, to grieve for my loss of all that I knew. To punish myself for leaving them alone for so long. For telling Farvak where they were this was my shame and the guilt consumed me. My doubts about Mother Tunare crept in, I was unworthy to be a servant of hers. <br>
<br>
I then visited the Heartwood Master, I begged him for guidance. He just looked into my eyes and said &quot;You must find your faith again and in your own way, child. I see your pain, but only time will heal you now&quot;. I said nothing to him of Farvak, that was to remain my secret shame forever.<br>
<br>
I went to my most secret spot in Lesser Faydark and Meditated there. But no answers came, no rest, no peace could I find. My heart ached and my head was too full of memories an grief.<br>
<br>
I found myself back at Crushbone fighting Orc's, hoping that just doing something, anything, would ease the pain of my now broken heart and dreams. <br>
<br>
I met many new fighters, made pleasant talk, joined many a fine group all in an effort to eradicate the strong hold called Crushbone. My skills improved every day as the rage that was inside took it's toll on the Orcs. I reached my 10th Leaf quickly.<br>
<br>
One day a ranger of the 12th Leaf asked if I would like to go to the Mino Caves that there was better loot and experience to be had. Ready for a new adventure I followed him. Once there the mighty Minotaur Slavers became the focus of my anger. The Harpies too felt the pain that my staff could give and the power from the spells I cast. But again their deaths gave me no satisfaction from my own pain. This land Faydwer held only pain now I felt I had to leave.<br>
<br>
I knew as long as I kept moving I had no time to think or remember all I had lost. Back to Antonica again, to get lost in Freeport, I could become nothing more than just another face in the crowd. My family gone, my dreams gone, my faith gone, who was I, what was I to do with my life. Empty was what I felt, empty and alone.<br>
<br>
I boarded the ship at Butcher Block once again. The trip had become all to familar. I sat back wishing for the days of excitement, adventure, innocents and hope. But the world was now tainted, I was now suspicious and bitter. When we reached Freeport I moved quickly to get away from all the people, all the happiness, the excited travelers new to this land, the reunited families and lovers. <br>
<br>
Running, I was heading for the Desert where my eyes had become as dry as the sands there, my soul as parched as the bones, my future as empty and dead as the land. I joined group after group hunting and killing, but never staying in one place for more than a day. <br>
<br>
I would, if it became necessary to have grass under my feet, run through the Ro Tunnel to the Commonlands. It was on just such an occasion that I met a Druidess, Oceanwolf, who brought to my attention that I was killing wolves and bears. I said &quot;So,what? They are good experience and I need the money&quot;. She spoke softly &quot;The Master will not be pleased&quot;. She quickly pulled out her purse and said &quot;You may have all I have. Please do not dishonor Mother Tunare, your vows to her or your brothers and sisters this way&quot;. The tears in her eyes the way she spoke, it touched a spark in my dead heart.<br>
<br>
Shocked I looked at her and said &quot;No! Put your monies away. I have need to hear your words. Please come speak to me of Mother Tunare and help me to find my way back to Her favor. Help me find my faith&quot; I spent many hours with Oceanwolf as she spoke I found I was hungry for her words, her wisdom, her faith. It was she who taught me that I had given evil the power and in doing so had become that evil. The words stung like a slap in the face. I found more confusion in them than truth, but watched my own thoughts become clear again. <br>
<br>
It soon was time for Oceanwolf to go, but I promised her I would never ever kill another wolf or bear again. That I would seek out the truths she had given me, to search for the path that leads to the Light. Once again I could walk in the favor of Mother Tunare. I offered up prayer and praise to Her and found that it was She who had been beside me all the time. That I was the one to turn my back on Her, all I had to do was turn around to find Her.<br>
<br>
Chapter 6 The message<br>
<br>
I spent the next few seasons fighting the Orc's in East Commons, helping those less experienced than I. Passing on the truth of the Light that Mother Tunare had shown me. Then destroying the evil that inhabited the ruined Druid Rings there, zombies, lesser mummies and ghouls. When I had become proficient at this I went back to the North Desert Of Ro to clear out the ruined Druid Rings there. <br>
<br>
Taking the lives of the poor lost souls of the Mad Men, even when you tried to talk with them to help them gain their sanity they would attack. Only thing left to do was to kill them and pray. <br>
<br>
Back to West Commons where my heart broke over the many bodies of the Great Kodiak that where being slaughtered along with the Black Bears and my blessed brother Wolf. <br>
<br>
Just when I could stand it no more I discovered an evil strong hold. Befallen, the undead had taken over this place and their kind found sanctuary here. I was now close to my 14th Leaf, I saw this as a chance to prove to Mother Tunare my Faith in Her. I crushed the skeletons without stopping again and again clearing the first floor with ease..<br>
<br>
Then I discovered and confronted the Dark Elf Shadow Knight there in a small bedroom. My rage and hate took control I attacked without mercy the Hate filling my very being. When the battle was done I stepped back to see the slaughter and was sickened and frightened by my own actions. Not only had I killed him but there wasn't a piece of him big enough to recognize as life, I was soaked in blood. One eye across the room looked at me as if accusing me of becoming that evil thing. <br>
<br>
I ran in terror and shame, I ran to the lake and washed my body my clothing and everything I had. Then washed them again seeing blood where there was none. I scrubbed till I was raw. Then sat and cried, when there was no more tears I gathered my things and made camp.. Sleep was restless and I was exhausted, what had I done. I had lost control, there was evil inside me it would take over and Farvak would win. I had need of meditative prayer. I would have to find my center and cleanse my soul of this hate that had found a harbor there. <br>
<br>
At daybreak I set off for Rivervale, I was in need of a master to help guide me into my center, my soul. &quot;Oh&quot; I thought &quot;I wish Oceanwolf were here she would know exactly what to do and say to comfort me&quot;. I entered Kithicor Woods, the memories flooding me, I was shaking from fear.<br>
<br>
It was here that I again met Bioa. He and a few hunters had been killing the evil beings that had taken refuge here. He was wounded,and badly. I quickly bandaged him and then used my druid powers to heal him the rest of the way. Then moved to each member in his party. I asked if he was okay &quot;Yes, thanks to you Katreena. Why does that name sound familar?&quot; he asked <br>
<br>
&quot;Ah, you don't remember helping me to High Hold Pass. You sat for days and watched over me. I'm afraid that I was not very gracious. I have not properly Thanked You kind sir&quot; I replied.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh yes, now your face looks familar. Consider me Thanked. How are you Lady&quot; He questioned. &quot;Fine, I have need of your help to reach Rivervale, Please if you would sir&quot; He quickly jumped to his feet, gave me a smile and said &quot;Gladly Milady, I am at your service&quot;. I shyly smiled and gave him thanks. We exchanged pleasantries as we made our way to Rivervale. I gave him what Druid Buffs I had and bid him good bye. <br>
<br>
Once there I went to the Druid Guild, spoke with the master Druid there. He again looked into my eyes and said &quot;Yes, Yes, I do see the need here you are troubled in your soul. Take this potion and go into Misty Thicket. Look for Mother Tunare in your heart. Drink this as you begin to Meditate. You will go on a soul journey. Now go&quot; I thanked him and left. <br>
<br>
I found Myself in dark forest of Misty Thicket, searching for just the spot that would help me to connect my soul to Mother Tunare's. Finally, tired, I sat down to rest before continuing. It was here that I felt Her call I quickly prepared myself. Giving Praise and thanks for all that she had blessed me with. I then drank the bitter potion. Only to find my head swimming in blackness a few minuets later. I tried to focus on my hands as best I could. They would come in and out of view and then gone. <br>
<br>
I felt myself floating... She came as a Light and spoke not with words but yet I heard her. &quot;Evil has no power unless you give evil Power. If you hate a thing you will become that thing&quot;. I could only form thought &quot;How do I not Hate that evil man for what was done to me&quot;. &quot;Show it My Love, child. Show it the Light of Tunare&quot; came the answer. <br>
<br>
I knew not how long I had been in this state or what I was to do with the message that was given to me. I was no more at peace with the hate inside of me than before. But I knew to have faith in Mother Tunare. All would be revealed to me in time. But questions still stirred, Did she want me to find Farvak and love him?? What! That made no sense, but then what?<br>
<br>
I found my way back to Rivervale and to the Druid Guild. I rested and spoke with the Master Druid. He wouldn't let me speak of what had been given to me. &quot;The message was for only you, you must find out what it means&quot; he said. I then asked for training, purchased the new spells for the 14th Leaf. <br>
<br>
I was at the bank when a more experienced Druidess asked if I needed Bone Hoop Earrings. &quot;Oh yes&quot; I replied. She asked me to stand there just a second. Then placed two in my hand. I tried to pay her and she refused. &quot;You need them now&quot; she smiled. I thanked her and bowed.<br>
<br>
I was just about to leave to go back to Commons when I overheard tell of a ring given to deputies that held<br>
a charge of heal, my eyes widened. I found out what it was that must be done. Kill goblins and turn in Runneyeye Warbeads to the Marshal till I gained favor with him. <br>
<br>
How many? What goblins, where? I asked around till I had the information. With 4 empty back packs to fill, I bound myself with my new spell to the entrance to Rivervale. Then ran to Misty Thicket to the Cave Mouth that opened to Runneyeye. There on either side were Goblin camps. I rolled up my sleeves and went to work. I spent weeks here killing those simple minded green goblins.<br>
<br>
I walked downstairs again to the other Marshal and asked &quot;Am I one with the Wall?&quot; I had done this time and again after each group of Warbeads was turned in. I waited for the answer, it came, I now held the ring. I was thrilled and quickly took it to the Casters Guild to Hummbl. Gave her the ring reluctantly, hoping she would charge it with the Heal spell and give it back to me. Yes.<br>
<br>
I also now had need of a special skill at the Druid Guild, Dodge I was now of the 15th Leaf. My efforts here had proved well spent. I had had time to hone my skills with the new spells and now had a new fighting skill as well.<br>
<br>
Chapter 7 <br>
<br>
I had grown tired of the darkness that was Misty Thicket, the goblins offered no challenge for me now. I had tried to enter Runnyeye on several occasions, but found it confining and I became lost in the maze of tunnels. I chose not to venture there until I had a few more seasons on me.<br>
<br>
I thought once again of Karanas, how I wanted to explore those vast plains. I knew that I was still to inexperienced to be of any success there. Next best thing was back to the Deserts of Ro.. I missed the sunshine and open air, the desert would surely give me my fill of both.<br>
<br>
I sat at the cave mouth to Kithicor Forest waiting for daybreak, when the evil that was there would take refuge in their dark holes. The passage through there would be fairly safe if one did not delay or stray from the path.<br>
<br>
There were a few others gathered here fighting the evil, vile things that had a stronghold here. I watched and would heal if I saw the need, inside cheering each victory won. It did my heart good to see that evil had to pay a price for it's existence. Soon it was time to get moving, I bid farewell to those at the cave and ran quickly towards West Commons. <br>
<br>
Upon reaching West Commons,I was drawn to the sounds of battle, Orc's grunting out death cries as two Men fought with them. I stopped and offered assistance, they offered to share the camp with me. We didn't group but instead I healed them and they would come to my aid if I needed help. I would give them the Orc belts that I came across for their share of my loot. We spent the day this way. They mentioned that I should go fight in the Oasis of Mar where the Orc's had a temple. I asked directions and made plans to head there the next day.<br>
<br>
I had stopped at the Inn close to the Toll both to East Commons where I was going to replenish my food and water when I was attacked from behind? What was this? I spun around and looked into a dark elf's face as he smiled evilly at me. I was puzzled and then all was black. Mother Tunare touched me and I awoke at Rivervale. I quickly gathered my thoughts, sat and remembered spells for the quick journey through Kithicor and beyond. It was no use to try and leave now as it was the middle of the night, I again would have to wait till morning. <br>
<br>
I awoke several times reaching for this item or that only to remember that my body lay in the Inn in West Commons. This was unnerving. I would cast camouflage on me just so not to be seen by passers by. As soon as it was morning I quickly ran the distance through Kithicor and to the Inn. <br>
<br>
I spotted my body, dragged it to the Toll Booth and the Guards there. I then collected my things. Who had killed me?? I thought one had to accept a duel to be killed by another. It was then that I heard the names Gix and Dragoon from a group close by. <br>
<br>
Dragoon took to the the area by the lake and Gix by the zone. They being of the Dark races roamed and ruled this area, killing any unsuspecting traveler unwary enough to pass through. I grew angry at the thought that I had been taken so easily, but thought better of challenging them as I had been killed so easily. One day I would have my vengeance until then I would bide my time.<br>
<br>
I headed onward to the Northern Desert of Ro when I heard tell of a Mummy that carried a magical rod. I again thought that this item would be a nice addition to my weapons. I heard tell that he was rarely ever seen but if he was it was by the Southern most Cutthroat Derv Camp by the wall. I would take down the Derv's there solo now and with very little trouble. <br>
<br>
However, after a week or so of not seeing this Mummy I became bored and moved on to the Oasis of Mar, to the ocean and then south to the docks. There I joined many a group by what was called the Orc Highway. It was the Sand Giants and the Specters that were ominous the rest was more of the same. At last I reached Level 17 here after many weeks of traveling between the Orc Highway and the Cutthroat Derv Camps. <br>
<br>
Time to visit Rivervale for new spells and training in the ways of the Druid. It was after I did this that I decided to try my skills at Tailoring. I purchased a large sewing kit and patterns, however I being a Druid and had vowed never to kill a wolf or bear. This would make this skill even harder to acquire. Spider webs would be my means of attaining most of my skills, I would however collect the pelts of bears and wolves from their dead bodies as a way to prevent waste and to honor their deaths.<br>
<br>
Chapter 8<br>
<br>
I had seen and heard tell of spiders in East Karanas that produced up to 4 webs per spider. Eager to start my training I was now headed there.<br>
<br>
On through High Hold Pass then down the long steep winding trail that lead to the valley and planes of East Karana.  I kept a sharp eye out once in the valley for the Cyclops brothers that roamed this land as well as the Evil Eyes. <br>
<br>
 My skin crawled with the thought of meeting any of these alone.  The Cyclops could kill you with one blow and the Evil eyes could cast spells that could make you blind and defenceless to fight them then there was the small mater of their pets.  Chances of me surviving at my leaf where slim I could always run for the bridge to North Karanas but that would put many of innocents in danger. No best to hide and avoid these beings for now. Ah, but one day I would challenge the evil ones and win.<br>
<br>
For now the spiders and lions would prove to be enough of a challenge for me. That and my lessons in tailoring, while I sat and regained mana, would keep me busy for now.  <br>
<br>
I stood on the vast plane eyeing the oncoming spider. lifting my staff to do battle.  I had become very good at what others had called Kiting the massive arachnids.  I cast snare slowing them down then between running and casting I could do enough damage that it took only a few blows to finish them off.   The problem was to stay out of reach of those poisonous fangs.  You may win the battle only to die afterwards from the poison they injected into your body, slow and painful was this death.<br>
<br>
Then there were the Matriarch lions.  Their muscular bodies and claws could kill the unwary quickly.  I learned to stay away from them when my health and mana where low. But when I was at full health and mana I could take them, they provided the pelts to increase my tailoring skills so that I was now able to sew patchwork armor. <br>
<br>
 All to quickly I had need of more training in tailoring.  I was soon off to Rivervale again to the Druid Guild there <p>Katreena Stormheart 39th Leaf Master Brewer <br>

I had shouted out &quot;Any one need a talented druid to help eradicate these stupid poor Orc beast&quot;. Oasis of Mar was the location, the days had wore on me. I was trying of the non stop march that the Orc warriors had day in and day out. <br>
<br>
I soon joined a Group of like minded fighters and there we stood at the side of the lake facing off time and again with one after another of these Orc beast. Filthy beast, they had a camp in my home land Greater Faydark. I had come to seek adventure and again ran up against the massive on slot of an invasion. <br>
<br>
In this group is where I first met the exotic Barbarian Luner. Who too, was far from her home Halas, and her companion a mysterious Man known as Shugar.<br>
<br>
Turns out she had been here longer than I and more experienced. She shouted out &quot;Stay close to the lake when we pull those beast in. Don't want the whole hwy to come down on us&quot;. I had been standing up on the ridge to watch the puller bring in another of the large beast. 3 came in all at once and the fight was non stop. <br>
<br>
When those were disposed of I sat down to meditate, regain my strength and mana. Mother Tunare was with us this day. I looked briefly around and asked if any needed food or water. Shugar asked and I gave, seemed only right, he started to pay me and I shook it off &quot;No, to keep you here is payment enough at the moment. We can't lose one as talented as you&quot;. <br>
<br>
Soon it was time to get up and fight another round with 3 or 4 more Orc Warriors. Again, Lunar reminded me not to stand up top the ridge. I bowed to her and gave thanks that she was watching me well.<br>
<br>
I have always been a curious sort, I would between breaks in the battle go explore. This had more than once gotten me into trouble. I must admit my shameful ways here and say that I should have learned not to do this in 18 seasons. But alas, I was born more interested in the spirit of adventure than the fame, fortune and glory others seek.<br>
<br>
I was glad that Luner had sensed this in me and brought me back to my senses.. &quot;Incoming&quot;, she shouted. <br>
<br>
Our group broke apart after a long day of fighting. Some needed to camp, some to go to Freeport, others on their way to lands unknown. <br>
<br>
Luner and her companion stood by me as she was preparing to go and said gently, &quot;Are you in a guild?&quot; &quot;No&quot;, I replied. She then explained that she and Shugar had admired not just my fighting skill, but the way I had watched every ones back. That and the easy acceptance of being told what to do without question and the care I had shown for all who where with me that day. <br>
<br>
She said &quot;You would be a fine addition to our Guild, The Bronze Dragon Fellowship&quot;. We sat and talked a while about the guild and the way she spoke of it made me hunger for my family and home. I was given directions on who to see and applied for membership. I bowed to her and Shugar and bid them fair and safe journeys. I then turned my thoughts to home and the bitter loss of my family, I was so lonely. <br>
<br>
It didn't take me long to decide to join this Guild. I needed family, I had been alone too long. It would be good to see a friendly face once in awhile in my travels.<br>
<br>
Chapter 2<br>
<br>
I could go back to Greater Fay, but I had not had my fill of adventures. And there Mother Tunare was whispering &quot;Come see this land I have made for you, come get lost in all the glory and wonder&quot;. How could I go home when there was nothing there for me now.  The there was the call to adventure with each person I met, I found tales to fantastic to belive. <br>
<br>
I had needed rest so off to East and West Commons to hunt. However, in my rush to have green grass under my feet and trees over my head, I had forgotten how sad this land made me. The Great Bears and Kodiak that roamed would have bodies scattered about. Here to the beloved brother Wolf would fall to the uncaring hand of those who could not see through a druids eyes. <br>
<br>
I would shout out in anger &quot;Do not kill these blessed beast please!&quot; To no avail, I was met with laughter and contempt for my beliefs. I tried to explained that the least they could do is give thanks for the great battle that had been fought with such bravery by the Great Bears. But my words seemed pointless to those who chose to hunt them down. I only stayed here long enough to fill my packs with Greater and regular Lightstones. Then I was off to the Great Plains of Karana again.<br>
<br>
I would have stayed in Kithor Forest had it not been long ago over taken with evil and dangers that I was not yet trained to take on. Then there were the bitter memories that this wood held the secrets that only I knew of.<br>
<br>
 Through the city of High Hold Keep, where battles raged so fiercely here on three fronts that the citizens had to stand at every corner. No rest for me here, I was not comfortable with the humans who lived in this realm and city life was not suited to me.<br>
<br>
Down the long trail to East Karanas where this time I discovered gnoll reavers who used my brother Wolf for evil. At night the undead would rise and use them to battle the living. I could not find it in my heart to kill them even if they had been turned from the Light of Tunare. <br>
<br>
I needed to stop at the Druid rings there in North Karana for training and spells. Then off to the Great Bird Avaik, who for some reason had built a city somewhat like Kelethin. I was hopping that this would add a save to my wounds and scars. I longed for my family and the forest of Greater Faydark. I was mistaken, I felt only more lonely and bitter. <br>
<br>
I pressed onward down into Lake Rathe. There I had come across an lonely man who was camped by himself, a hermit of the lake if you will.<br>
<br>
I attempted to share and give comfort to this lost sole, only to have him attack again and again. I had another season under my belt when I left and he was not changed. <br>
<br>
From there I did not venture far. Here there are Great Bird Avaik Guards, who for some reason feel they must guard. What I am not sure as they never once took up battle with anything. I thought, well I may as well attempt to hone my skills and new spells with these great birds. I knew they would provide the challenge.<br>
<br>
Chapter 3<br>
<br>
I had spent a few days here grouping with like minded adventures. This is where I first met him, a Warrior, a Human with a grin as wide as his shoulders and as bright as his armor. He had a few seasons on me the bore the guild tag of the Bronze Dragon Fellowship. I asked him how he liked the guild. Turns out his sister was Lunar, a Stormheart, too. He said he would speak with the guild and see what he could find out about my acceptance. We fought well together off and on over the next few days and spent time talking of adventures. <br>
<br>
He then asked a strange question, Marriage. I knew him only a short time, and had enjoyed our time together. But this was not what I had expected. after all, I gently told him &quot;I could not accept the kind offer that my heart belonged to Mother Tunare. I had a taste for adventure. I did not see my self with any one, nor could I take on the responsibility of keeping out of trouble myself. That it wouldn't work any way He being a Human and I a Wood elf&quot;. We parted friends. <br>
<br>
Then the great day came when I was accepted into the guild.<br>
Lady Kelee invited me. I was enthusiastic to say the least<br>
I now had a family everywhere, a friendly face to greet.<br>
<br>
Back to Lake Rathe I traveled. There he was again, he was not in the guild anymore. He said simply that something personal had happened, however, he was to soon to rejoin. I asked no questions and expected not explanation. He looked at me and said you need a better weapon. Lets go to Runnyeye and Get you a staff. I blushed and asked &quot;Are you sure?&quot; He explained that He would get some more people to help out.<br>
<br>
Well, true to his word there he was with friends from the guild awaiting my arrival and he had his tag back. Greeted me with that grin and said &quot;Lets get you a lens. I can use some bi armor, too&quot;. We set off and down into the depths of runney eye there we fought side by side with other guild members whom I cannot remember but only thank here. It all seemed like a game to him. He and I would joke and laugh as we fought side by side. This was the first time in along time the loneliness in me seemed to subside.<br>
<br>
Finally the elusive Broxx showed up the battle fought and won. I was given the lens and sent on my way with well wishes. It was a great day and one of upset as well. For as I turned in the lens little did I know you had to have good faction with the gnomes. So I didn't get the great Staff Of Observers that day.<br>
<br>
Chapter 4<br>
<br>
I in my disappointment went home to Greater Faydark. There I met a Mage by the Name of Elemental she had happened upon the Great Bloodforge Hammer and passed it to me once she had heard of my trials. <br>
<br>
There was a message from Him asking what I was doing. I sent word back that I was in Butcher Block resting. To my surprise He seemed to have dropped what he had been doing and came all the way from who knows where to help my new friend Elemental by passing on some Orc belts. I found myself admiring and thinking fondly of him as he had come out of his way and was so generous with no thought of repayment. I thought he would have moved on after I had said no to his desire to be a husband, but there he was and then gone on his way again just as quickly.<br>
<br>
I once again travel to South Karana this time to try my hand at killing the Tesh Mall Gnolls that had an underground city there, an Evil Race. I had taken to heart the Code of the Bronze Dragon Fellowship and knew it was my duty to eradicate evil wherever I found it.<br>
<br>
I was on the move again, adventure called me north. Low and behold, there I had met up with him again in North Karanas. He invited me to hunt bandits by the river. I found myself glad to see that familar grin. He was now such a good friend and partner and easy to hunt with. We all to soon disbanded camp and I went one way he another.<br>
<br>
Time passed and I wandered the lands looking and exploring every part I could, seeking adventure everywhere.<br>
<br>
Much to my surprise, there was a message &quot;Need help. In Kunark. Can you come. Caddil&quot;. Now how could I not. So off I went to see what I could do to assist him. There he was at Fironia Vie dock. That grin, and as always, happy to see me. He had lost his stuff somewhere in Lake Ill Oman and needed to find it. As we ran he teased me about being his druid and pet. I thought this was a nice friendly tag for me. I teased back with friendly banter which had now become our way of chatting. &quot; Okay, how did you lose it this time?&quot; &quot;Goblins&quot;, he said &quot;Nasty things, but good experience&quot;. I looked at him and thought, Oh my.. Do I have enough skills to pull this off. He directed me to the place and, &quot;Yup&quot;, there were goblins there. Unlike I had never seen. Our first encounter was a disaster only to have to go back an retrieve my stuff as well. Again I asked&quot; Where is your stuff&quot;, &quot;Somewhere here&quot;, he replied.<br>
<br>
Into a tunnel we went, I had cast superior cameo on both of us and hoped that these exotic creatures could not detect us. Down farther I went asking him &quot;Where are you?&quot; He had gone ahead of me answering back &quot;I cant see. It is too dark&quot;. Only then did I remember he was Human and thought, &quot;Oh yes, Humans cant see in the dark like Wood Elves&quot;. I took my Bloodforge Hammer out, finally found him and gave it to him. I said &quot;Now lets get this done&quot;.<br>
<br>
We roamed the caves with danger and adventure everywhere. This was just what I had needed, my heart pounding fast my senses on edge. <br>
<br>
At last we broke through into a clearing and there was his stuff. The adventure done I was happy he had his stuff, but sad that we would be going separate ways again. He gathered his things up gave me back my hammer and thanked me heartily. He invited me to stay and fight with him but I to timid said &quot;Nay,sir. I am not ready to deal with unknown lands as these now&quot;. Again we parted better friends. I had had fun, scared but fun. <br>
<br>
Chapter 5<br>
<br>
The Next time we met was at the Wedding of Nef and Lunar.<br>
There he was boisterous as ever. &quot;Kat, where did you get that shield&quot;. I had been to Mist moor and had been given a shield after fighting and losing a random draw. I will save that story for another time. &quot;Can I use it&quot;, he asked I timidly thought this over and said &quot;Yes, go ahead&quot;. He and Eldo couldn't resist the temptation to duel.<br>
<br>
Joyous and happy was the occasion and when it was done everyone was headed to the arena. Caddil invited me but I declined, as I had some far traveling to do. He once again bowed and gave me back my shield. &quot;See you around my pet&quot;.<br>
<br>
Chapter 6<br>
<br>
A few more seasons I hunted in familiar lands. Looking for the excitement I had found in Kunark. There was some to be had in Rathe Mountains and going deep into Feerrott. I even so bold as went into the temple of Cazie Thule. It offered the chase, but I felt I was not quite skilled enough to venture very deep there.<br>
<br>
I had finally felt comfortable enough with my skills to travel back to Karana, to the lake Caddil had me venture to. &quot;Ah, the prize, to explore the new land&quot;. The temptation to great not to go, with tails of dangers and adventure filling my mind I soon found myself there.<br>
<br>
Caddil had mentioned Sarnaks earlier, that sounded good to me, off I set. Once again looking for a group to join. I had been there only a few days, when there he was &quot;Hiya, Kat, How is my pet&quot;. Soon we were fighting side by side like always he boasting about this kill or that skill,. Showing me his latest trophy and armor. I by his side casting getting to know what he wanted and when. He laughing at me when I couldn't get it right and cheering me on when I did. <br>
<br>
&quot;Coming Kat, lets go do...&quot; I would cringe thinking &quot;I'm not skilled enough for this&quot;. There I found myself in the thick of battle. Almost always hiding behind Caddie, but there. I leaned to trust him as he would say &quot;Don't run, I will get it&quot;. I would close my eyes hard and pray knowing that it only takes 3 hits and I'm a dead druid. <br>
<br>
When I would open them there he would be grinning &quot;Got It.&quot;<br>
I would check out and see what damage I had sustained and more often than not it was him who needed the heal.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ya got food, Kat.&quot; I had learned early on this man traveled fast and thought little of comforts. He only carried a small supply with him. I always had food and water and was more than willing to share. That, and his grin could have been his calling card.<br>
<br>
Always, every time he met me he would want to know what I had been doing and listened to me intently. I know I must have been a bore, as I'm sure his adventures where more danger filled, pressed with much more excitement at every turn. I found myself envying him, to be so strong and sure of every move. I wished I had had that confidence in my skills. <br>
<br>
He would check my equipment out and tell me I needed this item or that and would soon bring me gifts and surprises. I a little more than overwhelmed I eventually asked &quot;Well, what is it you would like to quest after&quot;. He would shake his head and laugh &quot;I can get what I need&quot;, boasting again. I feeling a bit foolish for even attempting to follow in his foot steps. I told him then that he could help me in my quest to fill my needs, but that for him to spend hard earned rewards was not to be, at least on me. I didn't like being indebted to any one. And in my pride especially not to him. <br>
<br>
I had been hunting the Mighty Giants in Frontier Mountains and had been so lucky as to pick up a Forest Loop. A much prized item. Caddil also was here once again bragging how he had a new axe and that he owed a fellow guild member for it. He was slowly paying him off. At last, I saw my chance to pay him back for his much to generous gifts. I in my sly ways discovered who it was and offered the Forest Loop as payment for Caddil's axe, a deal was done. I felt much better for the act. Pridefully I thought &quot;Now we were even and I would no longer be in his dept&quot;. <br>
<br>
Chapter 7<br>
<br>
Next time I saw him He had grouped at the Sarnak Fortress all day killing the nasty looking 3 horned lizard creatures. I had a season up on him now and he was determined not to let that stand for long. I joined him and found that he was grouped with a fellow traveler named Calicer. <br>
<br>
Caddil and my teasing of one another had become all too familar. I would tease &quot;All Hail the great and mighty warrior Caddil&quot; and he would bow and say &quot;that's my pet&quot; Then kiss my cheek in jest. This put Calicer off a bit, not knowing that it was all in fun between friends. I joked that Caddil would kiss him to, however that Caddil was a Mans Man. That being said even he joined in the jest. <br>
<br>
Between battle we spoke of adventures and Calicer asked about the Guild. It was Caddil who invited him to the planned event that night. We made arrangements to meet later on as I was to be the transportation for that evening so we could all attended a Fight Night. <br>
<br>
We arrived and Caddil rushed in leaving Calicer and me at the gate. I unsure of exactly what was going on stood outside timidly peering in, amazed. I told both of these men &quot;To go right in. I was going to watch from here&quot;. Caddil returned, only shrugged those big shoulders and grinned at me. Calicer followed him in. <br>
<br>
Soon Calicer was taunting me. Asking me in, saying that he didn't know who to challenge and I would be safe with him. I thought &quot;Okay girl, get your bucket of guts out and show our invited guest what it means to be a Bronze Dragon Fellowship member&quot;. In I went nervously looking around exploring every corner of the massive arena. <br>
<br>
Up on the platform Calicer stood looking around. So I hit him with a spell. Snared him down and started a battle laughing and saying &quot;You did want to do battle?&quot; He came after me and off we went my health going down fast. I ran for the gate to regain my composure and health. I though &quot;Now,that wasn't so bad for this Wood Elf. Lets go do it again&quot;. I teased Calicer until he returned and we had another go around. At last he conceded, I think he just let me win. He stopped fighting back and begged for mercy. I told him I would not kill him but let him live with the shame that I had bested him. <br>
<br>
I thought this was fun and soon was up on the platform again this time looking for a fight. There stood Banlaen, he hit me with a spell that sent me reeling. When I gained my senses back, he said teasingly &quot;TAG&quot;. Oh, what a challenge, I could not leave it unanswered. Little did I know he could disappear from sight and reappear in the blink of an eye somewhere else. This was going to be much harder than I thought. Around the arena I chased him finally caught him outside the gate. I snuck up and &quot;TAG&quot; I was off in a flash. On through the night the laughter never stopped. Finally it was time for me to go and Caddil came by and said &quot;Alas my sweet timid pet has become a bloodthirsty killer&quot;. He grinned and pecked my cheek bid me farewell.<br>
<br>
Chapter 8<br>
<br>
The next time I met Caddil he said to me &quot;I'm going into the gorge today to hunt Evil eyes, want to come&quot;. Knowing full well that I desired Polished Bone Bracers. &quot;Oh&quot;, I shyly said. &quot;Well, if your already headed in that direction I would like to come&quot;. He laughed &quot;I have a druid I need to get a pair for so we will get you a pair, too&quot;. <br>
<br>
I wondered who was this druid but didn't ask. I was a friend nothing more and it wasn't my concern. Still I found myself a little uneasy about this other druid. Hummm<br>
<br>
We spent a good part of a day camping the Evil Eyes. Loot was good and we did get a pair of the bracers. Then finally Caddil had to leave. I tried to give those to him for his druid friend. but he said &quot;Naa, I'll come get another pair soon enough. You need them now&quot;. <br>
<br>
So I made up my mind to return to the area and get the second pair by myself if need be. I was well into camping the Massive Eyes and able to take them down one at a time by myself, who would have known. <br>
<br>
I had one bracer and needed only one more to help this druid of Caddil's. That is when here came Caddil strolling in with another woman at his side &quot;Come on&quot; he said &quot;we can get the other one quick enough and then be off to Runnyeye to get some Bi armor&quot;. He was right of course with their help we soon had our prize. He said &quot;Kat, can you hold those for me? I will get them later&quot;. Off he went with his new friend to do battle in Runnyeye again. <br>
<br>
Chapter 9<br>
<br>
I had received a call to The frigid City of Halas a young Barbarian there needed guidance in the ways of Tunare. A shaman who still had to gain control of his skills. I took what I could to help lead him in the service of Mother Tunare herself.. <br>
<br>
I joined the young Shaman at what they Called Orc Wall. yes even here the evil Orcs had a stronghold. <br>
<br>
 His name was Slaor, strong and intelligent but quiet, he seemed unsure of his calling.  For many days I would talk of Mother Tunare and her ways. He would ask what it was that Mother Tunare wanted from him, I could not answer as I only knew that she had her reasons. <br>
<br>
 I would help him do battle explaining how to best defeat this enemy or that. Talking of the spells that he would best find useful and in what situation.  We became fast friends, I felt stirrings in my heart that frightened me. At night we would sit by the fire that he has built and I would tell him of the adventures I had had the lands I had seen. He would wrap me up in hides from the great Polar bears.  We would sleep very close together for warmth in this frozen land it was the custom. <br>
<br>
It was on just such a night that he asked about the guild and I spoke of family and the friendships I had made there. He was interested in joining, so I gave him the appropriate information. He was kind and gentle sole, I was sure would do well in the Bronze Dragon Fellowship.<br>
<br>
After our discussion we had bedded down for the night when I felt his arms wrap around me.  I felt a desire that frightened me even more I wanted him to hold me.  Once he was asleep I quietly packed up and left.  How could I want any man in that way. No it was best if I just left.<br>
<br>
Soon the Bronze Dragon Fellowship called him into service. I was asked to give him transportation to Sir Koraf for the invitation into the guild. I knew once he bore the tag of the Bronze Dragon Fellowship he too would find a family that would help and support him well.  <br>
<br>
He meant my eyes with hurt in his, but said nothing and asked no questions. I was thankful for this and was able to treat him like a brother and friend.<br>
<br>
I brought Slaor to West Commons after that to give him a taste of green land. Turns out it was just in time for a Bronze Dragon Fellowship Raid into the depths of Beholden. A place of Undead and stench. I always hated these places, they made my skin crawl with the evil and unnatural things that lived deep inside, nothing good could come of it. Here I once again met up with Caddil and Banlaen I introduced Slaor and our newest member. They took to him as one of the family.<br>
<br>
Chapter 9<br>
<br>
Caddil was on a quest, eager to get the Thex Mallet found in Befallen. I was again listening to him boast that he could clear all the floors, no problem. There I was timid and unsure never having adventured down below the 1st door, that was many seasons ago. He lead me down into the depths explaining the quest in detail. I kept wondering &quot;Why he would even think of me to help in this after all He could do all this himself&quot;.<br>
<br>
Well that wasn't quite right. He did need me to give the note that was taken off of Gix and give it to Skeleton Lrrod. We did this several times without success. Banlaen even came to help. I said &quot;This must not be the correct note. We may need to have a Dark Elf who has turned to the light to help with this&quot;. After much asking around I found one who was willing to help. Giving him the instructions to asked Gix for the note then give it to the Lrrod. We three would jumped down the well to destroy the Commander Windsong&quot;. It worked and the quest was done.<br>
<br>
It was here that Caddil told me of the Paw of Oppola. Once again he had sparked the adventurous spirit in me.<br>
<br>
He said we can do this quest together &quot;You and I, we will get 2 of everything&quot;. &quot;Okay, no problem&quot; I said. He wasn't ready to do the quest just yet, though. <br>
<br>
I was eager to have that prize. I had many messages over the following week asking what I was doing. I would send him a reply &quot;Camping for the rings&quot;. &quot;Blah&quot;, he would answer &quot;Come join me. We can do that some other time&quot;. If he had only known the temptation he created in me, but my desire for the Paw is greater this time. <br>
<br>
Finally I was so bored awaiting the Mummy Gylnok to appear, I thought I would go crazy. Sure enough I would have had it not been for the kindness of passers by who gave me encouragement to go on. In those last hours a familar face came by, Banlaen said &quot;You need to rest and get out of here&quot;. I argued &quot;No,I would not give in to the temptation to leave&quot;. Resigned he asked what he could do to help. I said I needed one more ring from Black Borrow, away he went.<br>
<br>
Just after that The Mummy Gylnok haunted befallen again and I was successful at destroying him, found the precious platinum ring. &quot;It was Mine at last&quot;. What a relief. Just then a note came from Banlaen saying he had the sliver ring in his hand. I quickly joined him in Qeynos Hills we together traveled into Qeynos to finish the quest and received the Paw of Oppola. It was done at last. <br>
<br>
So with that done I went back to the Land of Kunark to see if the Paw was worth the price I had paid. For being bound to one place so long with only stories from those who took pity on me during my vigilant hours. It was and more, to my surprise, my skills and mana had improved much. It was time to make up for the lost experience. <br>
<br>
I was eager for adventure again.. A friendly face of one who had giving me encouragement while I had camped was here, Gorsha. He and a friend said &quot;Come join us. We will kill Sarnak together&quot;. All to soon his friend left us to do battle alone. I was much more seasoned than Gorsha and thought I would help family and friend to gain more experience, by watching out for him. That turned my thoughts to Caddil, how many times had he done the same for me. I cleared my mind and prepared to do battle with Sarnaks.<br>
<br>
Chapter 10 <br>
<br>
A call came from Mildikin a gnome tinkerer who needed to teleport into Steamfont and then out to West Commons. A very special event was to take place within the guild, a fireworks display. I needed to now be a mule, to carry bags of equipment from one area to another and collect bat wings, was my order. And who was there as well, Caddil &quot;Hey can't let you have all the fun&quot; he teased. He had made room in his packs to also carry finished fireworks. Along came Slaor, who too, would help. He had been hunting just to the west killing Minotaur in the caves close by. I sent a message out to tell everyone of the event as I hunted down batwings for Mildikin. Soon we could carry no more and off we went to Antonica. There we would separated and then rejoin for the event later. <br>
<br>
We all joined up at the tunnel that ran from East Commons to North Ro. It was time to set off the fireworks and rejoice in the Bronze Dragon Fellowship. It was a special night for Wysh had announced his engagement and introduced all who where there to his fiance. <br>
<br>
A break in the fire works occurred when a duel had broken out. A friendly one by the looks of it, between Wysh and Caddil. I was busy handing out fireworks to those late comers and not really paying attention to the action. The next thing I knew Caddil was gone in a flash. He sent me word that he had quit the Bronze Dragon Fellowship, he was extremely hurt and angry. <br>
<br>
I felt my heart plummet. Oh not to see him again, not to see his shoulders set in battle, or to see his grin, or to hear him say &quot;Kat, you got some food. Or, &quot;Can you get me too ??&quot; I pondered the situation long and hard. Who else knew me so well, who would be my hero when I got myself lost and in trouble. I didn't realize how much I had come to rely on him, or how much I looked forward to his banter. What now, what to do. To quit the Bronze Dragon Fellowship and follow him. That would be fool hearty indeed. Yet that is what I wanted, but NO you don't just quit your family because you are hurt. The arguments went on in my head for days. I belonged to a Family and you don't quit family. I had to look at this sensibly. <br>
<br>
It was then I received word &quot;Come join me in Sol A. We will adventure together, again&quot;. My heart took fight as I ported into Lavastorm. There he was &quot;See my new leggins, I&quot;I'm dead sexy&quot;. I joked back &quot;We'll see, you might be dead, soon&quot;. Off we went down into a new world. He no longer angry confided in me that he had been wrong and acted to hastily in anger. There was that grin that so endeared him to me. <br>
<br>
I asked myself what this is, I felt stirrings within my heart. Confused I thought this will never work you know a Human and a Wood Elf. Were is the sense in that. <br>
<br>
Sure enough we soon where both dead in the depths of Sol A. Having to fight our way back to collect our things once again. Finally he said &quot;Lets get out of here I'm tired of a losing battle&quot;. Off we went to High Hold to kill the evil Pickclaw that lived under High Hold Keep. &quot;Good experience&quot; he said. <br>
<br>
When we had tired of that off to Runnyeye to get BI armor for Slaor. Even now he supported the guild. Even if he never was able to rejoin again. It was not common for one to leave the guild three times and be invited back.<br>
<br>
&quot;No, I do not love him&quot;. I once again said to myself this will not work I am a free spirit who belongs to Mother Tunare. Then the answer so clear came. Hadn't Mother Tunare set him in my path time and again. Wasn't it he who had encouraged me to adventure even farther than I ever had. &quot;Come join me&quot; his words echoed in my mind. Wasn't it he who protected me from harm when danger was at it's greatest &quot;Stand Still, don't run I will taunt it off&quot;.. again his words echoed. Didn't this serve Mother Tunare wishes for me. Were these not acts of one who loved me. <br>
<br>
So on my way back from delivering Caddil's gifts to Slaor I sent him word that if the offer still stood I would be more than honored to join with him in marriage. That to be his pet was not enough anymore I had come to want to be his partner in good and bad in all that he has to share. He then gave me the news that &quot;Yes, yes he would take me for his wife&quot;. As if the moment couldn't be more happy he told me that he was to rejoin the guild. That High Lord Rashek had been so moved by those who pleaded in his stead, that Caddil would have one last chance to be a Bronze Dragon Fellowship member. <br>
<br>
Chapter 12I was looking for a wedding gift for Cadill, my search had taken me to Qeynos Hills but to no avail.  I ran into a Monk that needed a Teleport from the pass there to the West Common Druid ring, I was happy to oblige him. He was dressed meagerly and said he had been killed in West Commons.  I understood all to well the dangers he would face running there. I quickly gave him the Spirit of the wolf, the Strenght of Stone and Skin like Steal then one last spell to teleport us to West Commons. He was so greatful and tried to pay me I just waved him off saying this is a Gift from Mother Tunare Serve the Light in all you do and pass on the kindness shown to you kind sir.<br>
<br>
Passing back through West Commons I heard a friendly bid of good night. Turning to find where it came from I heard him ask &quot;Kat is that you?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, Slaor it is I, Katreena. I heard you yell out good night to the guild and came quick as I could&quot;.<br>
<br>
&quot;Why did you not answer back?&quot; He said worried.<br>
<br>
&quot;I wanted to talk with you in person&quot; I replied.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh, this sounds of a serious note&quot; He said. <br>
He stopped in mid sentence and looked into my eyes and must have seen the pain there, that I was trying so hard to hide.<br>
I sensed anger rising in him, but he kept cool and asked me &quot;Come share some of my wine and warm yourself by my fire<br>
Katreena, tell me of your journeys&quot;.  A chill went down my spine as these words were spoken. Isn't that what he had bid me so many seasons ago, in the cold dark night of the<br>
frosty tundra.<br>
<br>
&quot;Slaor&quot; I began &quot;I wish I had more time to spend with you now. But I can only stay a short while&quot;. I was so uncomfortable and I sensed that he could feel the uneasiness that was in the air.<br>
<br>
&quot;Tell me now the truth what is it that has shaken you? You have always been honest with me Kat do not stop now&quot;.<br>
<br>
&quot;I had hoped to spare you of this news, Slaor. We need to finish what is between us and our unspoken love for each other.&quot;<br>
<br>
This caught him by surprise and he flinched but said nothing.  I moved close to him now and laid my head on his chest.  This way I couldn't see his eyes when I knew the hurt that I would soon be causing him. That hurt would be reflected there in his eyes.<br>
<br>
 &quot;I have known of your love for me for some time now. Ever since the time we were together in Everfrost.&quot; I said sadly<br>
<br>
&quot;You left so suddenly and with out a word&quot;. He interrupted<br>
<br>
&quot;Please don't stop me, this is hard enough&quot; I begged. Taking a deep breath I continued. &quot;I realized that I loved you too, Slaor. And that is why I left&quot;. I felt my eyes sting as they filled with tears. Tears that now made it down my cheek and dropping onto Slaor's chest.  I gasped for breath as my throat tightened with emotion. &quot;I was too young for love of this depth. My heart and my head were spinning in chaos. I was to bitter about the past. To many losses.  You being a Barbarian and me an elf? I had to run. I had to have time to think&quot;.<br>
<br>
I continued, &quot;I spent time in meditative prayer. As well as adventuring, but you were always there on my mind.  I had sorted my feelings out hopping that you would always be a friend&quot; <br>
<br>
 Now came the hard part as I paused for courage to go on.  &quot; I had met a warrior before I was sent to your side by Mother Tunare. He has a lust for adventure such as none I have known.  In the beginning I thought of him as only a friend as well.  But, things have changed between us, they have gone beyond those feelings of friendshiped. I now have deep feelings of love for him. This time I am ready, I no longer fear what it will mean to be his wife. You see Slaor I am to be wed in 2 days time&quot;.<br>
<br>
I felt his chest fall his breathing become labored as he whispered &quot;Go on, tell me who this brave warrior may be&quot;.<br>
<br>
My heart ached for him as I slowly said &quot;Do not be angry with him, Slaor. Please.&quot; I said through falling tears. &quot;You know him well.  Caddil&quot;. <br>
<br>
His body stiffened, his voice angry and surprised &quot;What? That bastard, my best friend!&quot;<br>
<br>
I now had to look into his eyes, to help soften the blow to his heart. I lifted my head and met his gaze. I pleaded &quot;It's not his fault that he did not tell you. It was I who asked him not to say a word to you. I wanted to spare you the pain&quot;  <br>
<br>
He stumbled on his words and thoughts &quot;I, I told him of my love for you.  He has been with you all this time. How could I have be so blind&quot;<br>
<br>
Again I pleaded &quot;Please, Slaor. Please turn your anger towards me, for I made him give his word not to tell you. You know him to be an honorable man. He would never break a promise. This has hurt him as well as you and it is all my fault&quot;.<br>
<br>
He looked at me resigned and said &quot;I wish you two all the happiness in the world&quot;.  I softly said &quot;Thank you, Slaor.  Thank you.&quot; <br>
<br>
We sat in quiet reflection of the past news drinking wine and staring into the depth of the night. The wolves seemed to echo the sadness that was between Slaor and I now. <br>

<br>
I awoke that morning with Mother Tunare shinning down on me. Everything seem perfect, ah but there was still an uneasiness in my body. An excitement and anticipation of the day's events. <br>
<br>
I spent the afternoon brewing a batch of vodka trying to calm my nerves. Then to run some errands here and there just to keep myself busy. Last minuet plans for the evenings events. &quot;Humm, do I have everything&quot;, confused and jumpy I turned to Frontier Mountains to join friends in Killing Giants. <br>
<br>
&quot;I just need to keep busy, just till this evening&quot;. I would sit down and quickly stand up as if sitting on bees. The tension was mounting. Time took forever to pass to evening. But, soon I was teleporting those who chose to attend the ceremony to North Karana for the long trek down to Lake Rath. What time, where, what Island, all became a blur to me, hugs and best wishes where said.<br>
<br>
&quot;Finally everyone was there, or were they? I looked around for his face. Passing out flowers to the brides maids and Clover to the Best man, I spied him. There it was that handsome strong form, those shoulders set firm and there the most gentle face and that all to familiar grin. <br>
<br>
Everything fell from sight except for his face, the grin, and his eyes, looking lovingly at me and saying &quot;I do&quot;. Joy so now filled me to overflowing, was there anything except us at that moment. I was now this brave young warriors wife, partner and lover, bound forever, by spirit, heart and sole. Blessed by Mother Tunare Herself.<br>
<br>
Nothing else mattered that evening as I lay in his arms, strong, safe and loved. How did I get to be so lucky I wondered. Then my head laying gently on his chest, his breathing comforting me, the gentle beating of his heart whispering &quot;I love you&quot;. I soon fell into a gentle sleep, happy and contented. <br>

Chapter 2<br>
<br>
Days turned into weeks that passed all to quickly.  Love has a tendency to blure things that way.  Our love and joy was only made deeper and more intense as we discovered more openly about who each person really was.<br>
<br>
Every day I found myself missing him if he left for only a few hours.  Was love like this burning so brightly meant<br>
<br>
  And Now the Bad News<br>
------------------------------------------------------------<br>
It was a bright morning, one of many that Mother Tunare had blessed. The air was crisp and fresh, the grass was sweet smelling, the trees swayed gently in the breeze. Since our wedding I was never more content or happy and everywhere the world seemed to be agreeing with my mood.<br>
<br>
I had been busy for most of that morning running here and there and had yet to meet up with my handsome husband who had been fighting late into the night the night before. I heard a whisper in my heart &quot;Where are you my love, I have missed you. Come to me&quot;. It was Caddil in the Overthere calling to me to share in an adventure. Joyfully everything else was forgotten as I made my way to his side.<br>
<br>
Once there I saw him not as a man but a wolf, someone had cast wolf form on him. He was strong and very much the leader of the pack, even in that form I loved him dearly. He came and nuzzled me and I scratched his ears and smiled down at him. His eyes were smiling and even in that form there was that grin. I never would have believed the depths my love had or could grow in that short amount of time. <br>
<br>
We fought side by side for hours, doing battle with new and exciting creatures of the Overthere. Kunark Rhinos, Thorny succulents, Stone catcher Cockatrices and there again were Sarnaks. Our group was small Caddil, myself, Sister Trimom, a Cleric Toxichat conversation was light and easy. <br>
All too soon Caddil spoke up and said that he had some business to attend and it was time for us to disband and go our separate ways. I chose to stay and continue fighting I was enjoying the day so much.<br>
<br>
I fought by the side of another warrior, Ergo was his name for the rest of that day. Many others would come and go and my role in the group would change from a healer to a fighter many times. Experience was good and I was content to explore this new land. <br>
<br>
I heard my love call to me over the hours and we would chat lightly &quot;How you doing, are things going well?&quot; Whispers of I love you were said throughout the day, confessions of how deep, sweet loving words shared only between him and I alone.<br>
<br>
Day wore into evening and soon my love said He had some bad news. &quot;Oh&quot;, I queried, &quot;tell me and I will try and see what I can do to help&quot;. He then said that he had been called to go on a mission for Mithanile Marr. Gently he explained that this may be a battle that he may not return from. &quot;What, No. You can't make me a widow so soon&quot; I protested. I knew that he would not have told me if there where some why for this not to be so. I conceded to that fact quickly and asked &quot;When Love, when must you go?&quot; &quot;That I don't know&quot; he said &quot;It could be tomorrow or in a week, but I must be ready when the call comes&quot;.<br>
<br>
He confessed that he had know of this news for some time and wished now he had told me sooner. I knew this burden must have been great for him to bear alone. I in my heart knew that he did not need a tearful,sorry, mournful wife. No he needed to have one that was strong and willing to let him do what it is that he must do. And so I comforted him and expressed my sorrow, lightly. Even though my heart was breaking, my world was crashing down around me, I knew that his leaving was inevitable. <br>
<br>
All I can do was thank Mother Tunare for allowing me this love if even for a short time. It is one that will carry me through my life. I again to soon will be alone, but I will always have his name and the sweet memories we share. As our time together grows short I will pray for him to return, in hopes that somehow, someway he will be save and return to me.<br>
<br>
We shared one adventure after another, special moments that only we two will know. <br>
