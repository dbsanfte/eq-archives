<br>
Just in from the test server: <br>
The Triple Attack skill has been removed from Rangers. After examining the effects of this skill during actual play, and then further discussion with both the development team and our player base, it became clear that triple attack was not a necessary upgrade to the ranger class. Rangers in their current form do damage appropriate to what we expect, and do not need additional upgrades to damage output. <br>
We'll keep you updated on any further adjustment to these melee changes. <br>
<br>
Oh well this just further thrusts Jur into hibernation...  Get used to seeing Abscond around more often... <p><html>

Rangers are useless.  I admit it.  I am worthless to a pickup group...  A hindrance to a raid.  My melee skills lack, and my spells do NOT make up for it.  We get shitty level 20 druid throw away spells at level 49...  I'm level 52 and I have 1500hp.  Thats just pathetic.  Not to mention my AC.  I can't solo high greens.  I can't get groups to save my life, and for good reason.  Warriors deal more damage then me AND have double my HP and 50% more AC then I do...  10 defense isn't going to help that.  Tripple attack wouldn't have helped.  Rangers just suck.  They are probably the only class that doesn't have something unique.  Everything we do other classes do it better.  Sure I can track for you however the hell often that comes in use.  I'm just upset I've been denying this for 52 levels.  My monk is 35 now and moving fast.  Soon he will be 52 then maybe someone will want me around...<br>

If you'll excuse me while I feel sorry for myself and cry over the last year and a half of my life wasted on a worthless ranger. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><html>

I think hpts and Defense needs to be raised and/or better spells. I am not saying that your class is balanced because I think there is room for improvement. <p><img src=http://home.att.net/~johnson.joshua/beeden2.jpg><img src=http://www.unityeq.org/images/krozar/usa_1a.gif>

Though the thought of triple attack makes both me &amp; Ferg get all giddy. Frankly it scares me. <br>
<br>
    With the higher amount of attacks per round it would cause our little ranger buddies to move to the top of the hate list even faster than they do now. <br>
<br>
    Now, the only way I can really see the benefits of having triple attack would be for the ranger to be wielding, what's it called, that whip that procs jolt. <br>
<br>
    I say Aye, take the triple attack away, but give my buds more than 10pts into defense. I think every point of defense equals about 6 hard AC, so basically what Verant is saying is.... Here's 60 free AC. <br>
<br>
    Now being the AC junky that I am I think that this rocks, but in the long run... I don't think it'll do that much good. <br>
<br>
    I haven't taken into account though whether or not there are special checks against a skill higher than 200 or not (which is what it's ranger defense is set at now). I guess we'll see with time how it effects the ranger class in the end.  <p><center><img src="http://www.facelink.com/edit/raw/rawimage/17/1913517.jpg"><br>

I have a hell of a time taunting things off of rangers because of their ***** dual wield double attack!<br>
<br>
You guys just hit way too well.  As opposed to POS Paladins who miss more often than any other class in the game...and don't have dual wield, or kick, or snare, or track, or sow......<br>
Who still get the sh*t kicked out of us at my level by greens, even with Lay Hands.....<br>
<br>
Now, do you REALLY want to continue this bitch session?  I can come up with just as many reasons Paladins suk as you can for rangers, if not more.<br>
I'll bet most of the other hybrid classes can too.<br>
I love grouping with rangers, would rather group with them than other Pallies.  <br>
One of the best groups I ever had was 2 rangers, a shammy, a chanter, a rogue and myself.  We rocked Velks!<br>

Hybrids suffer in the high end game. Shadowknights i know the least about, so i don't know if they have the same problems we do. bards might not deal as much damage as the rest of the hybrids, but their songs amke them invaluable on many raids/zones. paladins might not do as much damage in some sense, but they have the hp/ac needed. also, while their buffs are most likely not going to be needed by a group, they have a good line of heal spells. Rangers dish out the damage, and people realize that. A good ranger watches his aggro. There is a stigma with rangers, and that has made it hard to find groups, i've been through it myself. But the rest of the world is learning that rangers are handy to have around. Track has come in beneficial many a time. And let's face it, if you need to get a mob off of a caster quick, who better then a ranger to build fast aggro. <br>
<br>
I expect there to be some other changes. VI is going to be looking at the spells for the hybrids again with Lucin, or shortly after its release. I can see many places where our spells could be jazzed up, but don't see it as necessary. A ranger is not meant to be a nuker, nor is a paladin, etc. most of our spells are merely utility in many ways. they are handy to have. I might not be able to heal myself worth a crap, but i know in the down time when Thor is canning down for mana, i get a good feel keeping him at full life with my lower heals. <br>
<br>
In the long run, if you like a class, you are gonna make it fun. If you let all the little things get to you, and make it unenjoyable, you are playing the wrong class. We're in/towards the higher end game now, so don't be too disapointed not being able to solo. a lot of people can't, even if their class should be able to. and while it might not seem a ranger has much to add to this group or raid, or this pally isn't really needed, etc. that isn't true. i know a lot of people who would rather have someone who can come in and do his job well and play his class well over someone who can't. if that means a hybrid over a traditional tank, that's just how it is. it takes imagination, intelligence, and a lil bit of courage to play a hybrid and make it work throughout. <p><center><img src="http://www.facelink.com/edit/raw/rawimage/84/1899584.jpg"></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#1E1E1E><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub5.ezboard.com/uthorvan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Thorvan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 457<br> <font color=#FF0000>(9/21/01 10:51:14 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub5.ezboard.com/fbloodcirclebloodcirclegeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1505.topic&index=10>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.bloodcircle.com/bcicon.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Sad Ranger...</span><hr size=1> In response to Fergussen's post I would have to say, Huzzah!

We are a mixture of cleric and tank, two essential classes in any group. And the higher we get, the closer we get to both classes. For example, at level 49 we get revive, 59 we get ressurection. The difficulty in playing the paladin class is that until level 40 or so warriors hit harder and clerics heal better. Past 40 that gap begins to narrow. At level 55 a Paladin is about par to a warrior in terms of damage dealt. We will never be quite the equal of a cleric but with exp rezz at least I can make some money that way.<br>

Now, Verant is still doing work with Luclin. There are some new spells for hybrid classes coming out. <br>
<br>
For Rangers:<br>
<br>
Hawk's eye, lvl 15. Not sure of purpose.<br>
named ranger's Defense: Increases AC<br>
Nature's Precision lvl 39: ATK Buff<br>
Force of Nature: lvl 49: Regen, Damage Shield, ATK Buff<br>
named ranger's protection lvl 60: Increase Hitpoints, Increase AC, Damage Shield<br>

and yes i can solo til 60 without much trouble but thats not what the game is about , when I want to find a group I just find some people I know and make one or join them , You can always find a group if you have lotsa friends ) . I could complain/bitch about being a Necro but lets face it .I love it . Necros ant a needed class on raids/ groups and cant nuke anything unless its undead and then at lvl 52 i can deal 585pts other than that it take me alot of time to kill mobs and on a raid or in a group My dots dont even take full effect befor the mob is killed . so to all the POS Rangers and Pallys <br>
play what class you want and remember its just a game HAVE FUN ....... <p>

I guess sterile conjecturing just isn't going to get us anywhere. now, if nothing comes out with the new expansion, i'll be more then happy to start dissecting all the classes. <p><center><img src="http://www.facelink.com/edit/raw/rawimage/84/1899584.jpg"></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#1E1E1E><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub5.ezboard.com/bbloodcircle.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=treenaspiritwolf>Treena Spiritwolf</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 26<br> <font color=#FF0000>(9/22/01 1:13:50 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub5.ezboard.com/fbloodcirclebloodcirclegeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1505.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Sad Ranger...</span><hr size=1> Awww ..

I think i remember posting a bit ago about how awesome you were juravial <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .  I would group with you anytime.  I have quite a few rangers in my guild.  They always feel like you do.  Just keep an open mind.  Like the necro said..no one ever looks for him cause necro's aren't considered group worthy i guess by some.  Me, I don't care.  I welcome anyone to play as long as they are cool...Ahem, yourself <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .  And i don't remember anyone dying the night i played with you when you dinged.  Plus, look i was a level 45 druid entering into Karnor's to help out, yes i got exp too but i never would have come if you hadn't asked me.  Now you could have looked and said, hmmm.. a level 45 druid might not do us much good.  But ya didn't..you gave me a chance..who knows maybe you were desperate &lt;chuckle&gt;.  Don't give up now.  Rangers aren't POS's.  You ever wanna play, look us up.  We have some people just around your level and we need help too.  You can play with us anytime hon <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .<br>
