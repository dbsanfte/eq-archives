&quot;Now Kygero!!&quot;, Katreena's mental voice rang in my head. I turned to Kaitlyne, dropping my hand in signal, she started her cast. &quot;COMBUST!!&quot;, Kaitlyne ended her spell and the door to where the evil Plague Bringers were meeting, burst into flaming splinters that shot far into the room. Without delay, the whole of the Bronze Dragon Fellowship that were amassing in Highkeep, stormed into the room, weapons whistling through the air in deadly efficiency. Lord Tiggyr, the newly appointed leader of the Bronze Dragons lead the charge bringing down two Plague Bringer lackeys quickly. I rushed in right after him and targeted another of the lackeys, &quot;FIRESTRIKE!!&quot;, and my spell caught the dark elf, blasting his body into a memory. The room filled up instantly with BDF members coming through doors and windows, allowing no escape routes. Sure enough, O'Berton, Iszabelle, and the rest of the Plague Bringers were jumping up from the table they were sitting at to make plans, their chairs flying out behind them in disarray. Immediately the air was filled with magic and electrical power, the room gleaned in different colors as different spells went off and lights flashed. The sound of steel on steel and the battle cries that controlled them became a cacaphony blending with the chanting and the spells going off. I spotted Iszabelle in the process of casting one of her deadly spells, and i started toward her not taking my eyes away. With my Wraith Bone hammer in my hand i quickly closed on her, she stepped back and then she saw me moving her way. Iszabelle's hands began to move in front of her and the syllables of a spell falling from her lips, it was going to be close. I exerted my limit of speed and strength to get to her before she could finsh her spell, for i knew it would be a deadly one. Damn, my luck had run out. The evil witch had just about finished her casting and i was still too far away to strike. With an evil grin on her face, she held her outstretched hands with palms facing me towards my chest and was about to cry her spells trigger word when all of a sudden, she stiffened and lost her facial smirk. Moving up to where she stood i saw Katreena's arms snake around Iszabelle's neck and arm. Being much stronger, Katreena pinned her prisoner to the table. Lowering my hammer, i smiled, glad to see her ok and Iszabelle with her face being smashed into the marble table.<br>
Katreena looked up and smiled for the first time in a long time. Sloar and Gorsha came running up behind me as they saw Katreena, both of them screaming in glee to see our guild sister.<br>
Katreena yelled out, &quot;Time for reunion later. Sloar, Gorsha, the door at the end of the hall...&quot;, she motioned behind her to the lighted hallway from where she snuck up on Iszabelle. &quot;In the room there, you will find that rat Farvak. He is weak and wasted, but still dangerous. Go and get him, bring that filthy creature in here with everyone else!&quot;<br>
&quot;Yes mam!!&quot; both men replied in stereo. Sloar and Gorsha grabbed a couple of the other BDF members and went about capturing Farvak.<br>
I looked over to where O'Berton was and found that Lord Tiggyr was standing in front of the Plague Bringers leader with his sword tip at O'Berton's neck. Riversong, Tweani, and Calicer all standing around O'Berton poised to strike. The sounds of battle died down and the highly charged air began to disapate, Tiggry's voice was loud and commanding.<br>
&quot;O'Berton, evil wizard and planner of the BDF downfall, SURRENDER OR DIE!!&quot;<br>
Smartly and to my disappointment, O'Berton lowered his hands and strained a smile. Holding his head high and straightening his robes, he spoke, &quot;I surrender.&quot;<br>
All the Plague Bringers dropped there weapons and waited to be bound and lead away. <br>
Katreena finished her bindings on Iszabelle and gave her to the BDF's that were charged with the jailing of the prisoners, the whole time Iszabelle screaming at the top of her lungs, &quot;This is not over Katreena, i will get you yet!! I will be back for you one day!! Wait and seeeee....&quot; then she was ushered out the door to be put behind bars.<br>
&quot;Excellent job sis, you performed with great courage and strength of spirit!! I commend thee!!&quot;<br>
&quot;Thx Kyg, i just obeyed the will of Mother Tunare and she gave me the strength to see it through.&quot;<br>
&quot;Agreed Kat, but she chose you cause of your strength and faith.&quot;, i replied.<br>
&quot;O.k., o.k., lets just go before they bring Farvak out, i really dont want to see his face ever again.&quot;<br>
&quot;Alright Katreena, let's go get cleaned up and we will talk later.&quot; At that time, Mythias and Kaitlyne both walked up behind me.<br>
Katreena started for the door, &quot;See you later Kygero! and thank you both for your help as well.&quot; She bowed to Kaithlyne and Mythias both.<br>
Mythias grinned showing all his pointy teeth, &quot;You are mossst welcome, guild sssissster of Kygero Keibugami.&quot;<br>
&quot;It was our pleasure Katreena of the BDF!&quot;, Kaitlyne finished and bowed in return.<br>
<br>
Next thing i know, everything is black... i see a point of light off in the distance, It grows larger until the brilliance of light is to intense to look at. I lower my eyes and then i hear a voice coming from the light.<br>
&quot;The witch Iszabelle was correct in her assumption, it is NOT over yet. The evil and destuction is just begining, you must prepare and watch closely the changes that occur all around you and everyone in Norrath. Be careful young druid.&quot;<br>
The light went out and reality set in again.<br>
I sprang up from my bed, sweating profusely realizing i was dreaming of the past couple days events. Remembering the voice, i knew i would never forget it.<br>
I got up from my slumber and splashed some cold water on my face. Brushing my hair out and putting clean clothes on, i went to Katreena's room to check on her. She had been sleeping alot and finally getting her chance to mourn her losses. When i turned the corner to the hall where her room was i heard her scream out, &quot;FIRESTRIKE!&quot; and then the blast of the spell effect. I bolted for the door and as i got to it i heard her cast her healing spell. The commotion died away, so i decided to wait a sec and listen. After a few minutes i heard her say, &quot;Go away!&quot;<br>
Did she know i was there at her door? Hmmm, i had to try. I knocked on her door softly. &quot;Sis, you ok? Can i come in?&quot;<br>
&quot;NO, just go away. Please go away.&quot; Katreena sounded distressed still, i would give her some more time.<br>
&quot;I will leave you alone Kat, but i'm coming back later. I need to discuss some things with you. Rest easy sis.&quot;<br>
I left her to her mourning and went to find Kaitlyne and Mythias. I went to the kitchen as i wanted to find something to eat. On my way down the stairs, i ran into Lady Kuvanu.<br>
I bowed to her, &quot;M'Lady, greetings to you this day. How fares thee?&quot;<br>
Kuvanu smiled and quietly spoke, &quot;Greetings to you Kygero and i am feeling most lightened now that the evil ones were put to death. Although i am surprised that Katreena had not come to see Farvak's execution.&quot;<br>
&quot;Yes M'Lady, i do not believe Katreena wanted to ever lay eyes upon him again, she is happy with the ending though, to be sure. She just needs more time, she was put through one heavy ordeal that tested her whole being.&quot;<br>
&quot;That is why i am glad i caught you alone here. You are going to the dining quarters i take it?&quot; Lady Kuvanu asked.<br>
I nodded to her, yes.<br>
&quot;Let us go together then.&quot;<br>
&quot;Yes M'Lady.&quot;, i responded.<br>
While i prepared some simple food stuffs of berries, cheeses, bread and grabbing the bottle of elvin wine, i poured us a glass while Kuvanu began.<br>
&quot;Listen Kygero, i know you have been doing everything you can to keep us informed and you were instrumental in the bringing down of the Plague Bringers. You and your Sister Kaitlyne as well as the Iksar, Mythias, did a remarkable job and it is greatly appreciated by all your guild sisters and brothers. Alas, that is why i come to you instead of anyone else. I need you to continue watching over Katreena as she gets her spirits back and becomes one with herself again. We are afraid for her sanity and health. Yes we know she is strong and will more than likely be fine, but keeping an eye on her would be advisable. Will you do this for me please?&quot; she took a sip of her wine.<br>
Gulping down the remnants of the berries, i responded, &quot;Of course M'Lady, i could think of nothing i would prefer to do. Katreena is in need of friends and her guild family right now. Think nothing of it, it will be done!&quot;<br>
Kuvanu stood, &quot;Good, thank you Kygero. Now i must be off. There are many things i have to do today. Take care and i will talk with you later.&quot;<br>
I got up from my chair and wiped my mouth with a cloth napkin. &quot;I understand M'Lady, be well.&quot; I bowed again to her as she departed.<br>
Cleaning up my small mess, i went to find Kait and Mythias. It was time to go to work again soon. We will have to try and keep grouped with Katreena for the next few weeks and maybe longer. I wished Gorsha hadn't have left right after the capture of the Plague Bringers. I missed him already.<br>
&quot;Tunare watch over us all.&quot;  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cac3ab><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub5.ezboard.com/uiszabelle.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Iszabelle</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.mmpog.net/EverQuest/BronzeDragon/Images/fadeskull.gif BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 27<br> <font color=#c54400>(12/19/00 9:25:50 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.mmpog.net/EverQuest/BronzeDragon/Imagesolf/Skull-33.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   the ending and the new beginning......</span><hr size=1> --------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
She was furious with Fravak for dragging Katreena to forsaken castle. She paced the jail floors awaiting the orders that were meant for her. She laughs at the thought that her plan will indeed work in due time when the right moment awaits and both parties will be satisfied with the outcome that has been planned for her so long. Fravak slumped in the corner repeating words after words, "Why did she do this to me". She felt no sorrow for the man. Oberton on the other hand is a wizard with his own magical powers. She would not worry about him for she knows he has his own plans.<br>
<br>
The guild leader of Bronze Dragon, Tiggyr, walked proudly and approached Iszabelle. "You sentence has come down. You have been sentence to death by my sword."<br>
<br>
Iszabelle closed her eyes as she heard the sword slide from the sheath. The last sound she heard was the sound of the blade slicing through the air towards her neck.<br>
<br>
…. The stench from the boggy swamps was oppressive. There in the crock of an old cypress tree rested Iszabelle’s secret. The secret she has stole for Phyllis, the paladin.<br>
A soul binder stone. <br>
