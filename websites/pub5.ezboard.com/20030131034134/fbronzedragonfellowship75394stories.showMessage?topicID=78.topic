I have already bound with another on the prime material plane and I can use her as a anchor point for our gate!”<br>
<br>
“She will not expect this Mi’Lord,” Safvas smiled despite itself, “ her blood will fuel the return of our kind to the prime material plane! We will bring hell to Norrath Lord….”<br>

These eyes belong to a wonderful soul and soul so tasteful the nine hells quivered in anticipation.  <br>
<br>
“Master, awake sweet master,” Safvas whispered into Katreena’s ear, “awake lovely I have a gift for thee!”<br>
<br>
Jumping away from her warm succulent body Safvas watched her, watched below her skin and admired her healthy body, her healthy veins that pumped the blood that even now reinforced their bonding…  Hurting Safvas, would be felt by her now.   So much so he could depart most of his damage to her had he wished to!<br>
<br>
A smile crept across his face as Katreena began to stir.<br>

My aching heart had not ceased to pound nor had the tears seemed to ease the loneliness that had filled my being.  &quot;Yes, morning&quot; I felt the weight of my body fill my senses.  I waited to open my eyes to the world wanting to stay in the dream that I longed to be true. It was then that I sensed something else in the room.<br>
<br>
    I lay quietly eyes closed, breathing slowly waiting to hear any movement.  Memorizing the Fire Strike spell as to cast it at the intruder the moment I knew of his direction.<br>
I had expected Farvak's friends to take his revenge on me, since I was the one to bring about his capture.  His hate for me must now be as great as mine for him.<br>
<br>
    The air smelled of rain and electricity, a storm was approaching.  The room was cold and offered no physical comfort. &quot;Why was I so haunted by evil? I questioned again.  &quot;What was it that drew it to me, like a moth to the flame?&quot; I wanted so much to just go back to sleep and dream of Caddil and me forever together as it should have been. As Mother Tunare had promised. <br>
<br>
    Just then I heard the soft rush of sound as if wings were delicately brushing the air.  I stood up and cast at my target surprised him, &quot;Safvas&quot; I looked at him surprised for only a second. Then I felt my flesh blister and burn.  Quickly I cast heal on myself and stood back trying to make sense of this new situation. &quot;Had he cast on me?, No I did not see him do so?&quot; <br>
<br>
    He smiled as his eyes found the questions that were in my eyes.  He spoke &quot;You catch on quickly, Katreena.  Do not attempt that again.  You will suffer all of my wounds and pain, you have been warned&quot;.  <br>
  <br>
    My mind spinning trying to find some understanding to questions that I didn't want the answers to. &quot;How, why for what purpose&quot; I needed time to think.  I sat down on the bed and tried to wake myself up.  This had to be one of my nightmares, I was still dreaming, right?!  <br>
<br>
    I closed my eyes and laid back down, covering myself trying to close out the reality of the moment.  Whispering with a quivering voice &quot;Go away&quot;. <br>

The loss of Safvas was a blessing. Safvas, O’Berton knew had broken the link between them and he was no longer a tool for the evil little imp. No longer did his blood boil when commanded by Safvas. Yes he was free of the curse and its bindings… <br>
<br>
Glancing about O’Berton knew the guild members had put him to death, but they had failed to cancel out his contingency magic, which whisked his soul away to his safe hold. There among the cold rocks waited four clones of him, now three remained as he stood up and began to rummage through the stored items he had placed here so long ago for just this occurrence. There on the bookshelf was his extra spell book. <br>
<br>
Returning to his secret tower in Kunark, O’Berton spent several days resting and gathering his thoughts. Slowly, overtime O’Berton began to remember the past, the past that Safvas had written for him. A past so deceitful O’Berton knew it would be a challenge to clear his name. Doing so would most likely mean his death at the very hands of the people he now needed to trust him if he was going to foil the plans of Safvas and its masters.<br>
<br>
Who or what did Safvas control now… O’Berton knew he must find this person for they had no idea the danger they now faced…<br>

I turned to Kaitlyne, dropping my hand in signal, she started her cast. &quot;COMBUST!!&quot;, Kaitlyne ended her spell and the door to where the evil Plague Bringers were meeting, burst into flaming splinters that shot far into the room. Without delay, the whole of the Bronze Dragon Fellowship that were amassing in Highkeep, stormed into the room, weapons whistling through the air in deadly efficiency. Lord Tiggyr, the newly appointed leader of the Bronze Dragons lead the charge bringing down two Plague Bringer lackeys quickly. I rushed in right after him and targeted another of the lackeys, &quot;FIRESTRIKE!!&quot;, and my spell caught the dark elf, blasting his body into a memory. The room filled up instantly with BDF members coming through doors and windows, allowing no escape routes. Sure enough, O'Berton, Iszabelle, and the rest of the Plague Bringers were jumping up from the table they were sitting at to make plans, their chairs flying out behind them in disarray. Immediately the air was filled with magic and electrical power, the room gleaned in different colors as different spells went off and lights flashed. The sound of steel on steel and the battle cries that controlled them became a cacaphony blending with the chanting and the spells going off. I spotted Iszabelle in the process of casting one of her deadly spells, and i started toward her not taking my eyes away. With my Wraith Bone hammer in my hand i quickly closed on her, she stepped back and then she saw me moving her way. Iszabelle's hands began to move in front of her and the syllables of a spell falling from her lips, it was going to be close. I exerted my limit of speed and strength to get to her before she could finsh her spell, for i knew it would be a deadly one. Damn, my luck had run out. The evil witch had just about finished her casting and i was still too far away to strike. With an evil grin on her face, she held her outstretched hands with palms facing me towards my chest and was about to cry her spells trigger word when all of a sudden, she stiffened and lost her facial smirk. Moving up to where she stood i saw Katreena's arms snake around Iszabelle's neck and arm. Being much stronger, Katreena pinned her prisoner to the table. Lowering my hammer, i smiled, glad to see her ok and Iszabelle with her face being smashed into the marble table.<br>
Katreena looked up and smiled for the first time in a long time. Sloar and Gorsha came running up behind me as they saw Katreena, both of them screaming in glee to see our guild sister.<br>
Katreena yelled out, &quot;Time for reunion later. Sloar, Gorsha, the door at the end of the hall...&quot;, she motioned behind her to the lighted hallway from where she snuck up on Iszabelle. &quot;In the room there, you will find that rat Farvak. He is weak and wasted, but still dangerous. Go and get him, bring that filthy creature in here with everyone else!&quot;<br>
&quot;Yes mam!!&quot; both men replied in stereo. Sloar and Gorsha grabbed a couple of the other BDF members and went about capturing Farvak.<br>
I looked over to where O'Berton was and found that Lord Tiggyr was standing in front of the Plague Bringers leader with his sword tip at O'Berton's neck. Riversong, Tweani, and Calicer all standing around O'Berton poised to strike. The sounds of battle died down and the highly charged air began to disapate, Tiggry's voice was loud and commanding.<br>
&quot;O'Berton, evil wizard and planner of the BDF downfall, SURRENDER OR DIE!!&quot;<br>
Smartly and to my disappointment, O'Berton lowered his hands and strained a smile. Holding his head high and straightening his robes, he spoke, &quot;I surrender.&quot;<br>
All the Plague Bringers dropped there weapons and waited to be bound and lead away. <br>
Katreena finished her bindings on Iszabelle and gave her to the BDF's that were charged with the jailing of the prisoners, the whole time Iszabelle screaming at the top of her lungs, &quot;This is not over Katreena, i will get you yet!! I will be back for you one day!! Wait and seeeee....&quot; then she was ushered out the door to be put behind bars.<br>
&quot;Excellent job sis, you performed with great courage and strength of spirit!! I commend thee!!&quot;<br>
&quot;Thx Kyg, i just obeyed the will of Mother Tunare and she gave me the strength to see it through.&quot;<br>
&quot;Agreed Kat, but she chose you cause of your strength and faith.&quot;, i replied.<br>
&quot;O.k., o.k., lets just go before they bring Farvak out, i really dont want to see his face ever again.&quot;<br>
&quot;Alright Katreena, let's go get cleaned up and we will talk later.&quot; At that time, Mythias and Kaitlyne both walked up behind me.<br>
Katreena started for the door, &quot;See you later Kygero! and thank you both for your help as well.&quot; She bowed to Kaithlyne and Mythias both.<br>
Mythias grinned showing all his pointy teeth, &quot;You are mossst welcome, guild sssissster of Kygero Keibugami.&quot;<br>
&quot;It was our pleasure Katreena of the BDF!&quot;, Kaitlyne finished and bowed in return.<br>
<br>
Next thing i know, everything is black... i see a point of light off in the distance, It grows larger until the brilliance of light is to intense to look at. I lower my eyes and then i hear a voice coming from the light.<br>
&quot;The witch Iszabelle was correct in her assumption, it is NOT over yet. The evil and destuction is just begining, you must prepare and watch closely the changes that occur all around you and everyone in Norrath. Be careful young druid.&quot;<br>
The light went out and reality set in again.<br>
I sprang up from my bed, sweating profusely realizing i was dreaming of the past couple days events. Remembering the voice, i knew i would never forget it.<br>
I got up from my slumber and splashed some cold water on my face. Brushing my hair out and putting clean clothes on, i went to Katreena's room to check on her. She had been sleeping alot and finally getting her chance to mourn her losses. When i turned the corner to the hall where her room was i heard her scream out, &quot;FIRESTRIKE!&quot; and then the blast of the spell effect. I bolted for the door and as i got to it i heard her cast her healing spell. The commotion died away, so i decided to wait a sec and listen. After a few minutes i heard her say, &quot;Go away!&quot;<br>
Did she know i was there at her door? Hmmm, i had to try. I knocked on her door softly. &quot;Sis, you ok? Can i come in?&quot;<br>
&quot;NO, just go away. Please go away.&quot; Katreena sounded distressed still, i would give her some more time.<br>
&quot;I will leave you alone Kat, but i'm coming back later. I need to discuss some things with you. Rest easy sis.&quot;<br>
I left her to her mourning and went to find Kaitlyne and Mythias. I went to the kitchen as i wanted to find something to eat. On my way down the stairs, i ran into Lady Kuvanu.<br>
I bowed to her, &quot;M'Lady, greetings to you this day. How fares thee?&quot;<br>
Kuvanu smiled and quietly spoke, &quot;Greetings to you Kygero and i am feeling most lightened now that the evil ones were put to death. Although i am surprised that Katreena had not come to see Farvak's execution.&quot;<br>
&quot;Yes M'Lady, i do not believe Katreena wanted to ever lay eyes upon him again, she is happy with the ending though, to be sure. She just needs more time, she was put through one heavy ordeal that tested her whole being.&quot;<br>
&quot;That is why i am glad i caught you alone here. You are going to the dining quarters i take it?&quot; Lady Kuvanu asked.<br>
I nodded to her, yes.<br>
&quot;Let us go together then.&quot;<br>
&quot;Yes M'Lady.&quot;, i responded.<br>
While i prepared some simple food stuffs of berries, cheeses, bread and grabbing the bottle of elvin wine, i poured us a glass while Kuvanu began.<br>
&quot;Listen Kygero, i know you have been doing everything you can to keep us informed and you were instrumental in the bringing down of the Plague Bringers. You and your Sister Kaitlyne as well as the Iksar, Mythias, did a remarkable job and it is greatly appreciated by all your guild sisters and brothers. Alas, that is why i come to you instead of anyone else. I need you to continue watching over Katreena as she gets her spirits back and becomes one with herself again. We are afraid for her sanity and health. Yes we know she is strong and will more than likely be fine, but keeping an eye on her would be advisable. Will you do this for me please?&quot; she took a sip of her wine.<br>
Gulping down the remnants of the berries, i responded, &quot;Of course M'Lady, i could think of nothing i would prefer to do. Katreena is in need of friends and her guild family right now. Think nothing of it, it will be done!&quot;<br>
Kuvanu stood, &quot;Good, thank you Kygero. Now i must be off. There are many things i have to do today. Take care and i will talk with you later.&quot;<br>
I got up from my chair and wiped my mouth with a cloth napkin. &quot;I understand M'Lady, be well.&quot; I bowed again to her as she departed.<br>
Cleaning up my small mess, i went to find Kait and Mythias. It was time to go to work again soon. We will have to try and keep grouped with Katreena for the next few weeks and maybe longer. I wished Gorsha hadn't have left right after the capture of the Plague Bringers. I missed him already.<br>
&quot;Tunare watch over us all.&quot;<br>

Your being foolish now, we have no time for this&quot;.  I felt my blood burning inside me, my mind fighting for control of my actions as I rose from the bed.  &quot;Oh be this a spell Of binding evil&quot; I spat at him. &quot;What makes you think I would not gladly die than to do your bidding&quot;.<br>
 <br>
   Safvas answered his voice amused &quot;How can I let my master suffer death&quot; <br>
 <br>
    Just then a knock broke the moment &quot;Are you alright?&quot; I quickly responded &quot;No Please go away&quot;.  My mind twisting with the thought that Safvas could kill my own family with my own hand terrified me.  I had to find out how this Imp gained such powers over me and I had to find out quickly.<br>
<br>
    I turned to him my eyes flamed with anger my voice low but defiant &quot;If Farvak could not control me what makes you think that you can do so, wicked one.  I am not to be controlled by anyone or thing and certainly not by you!&quot;<br>
 <br>
    I found my clothes and pulled them on quickly my actions were not the graceful ones of habit but rough and shaky.<br>
<br>
    My time for grieving had come to an abrupt end. Anger filled every inch of my being, my mind now becoming sharp and clear.  Where there had been clouds of emotions and the rain of tears, it had been replaced by a gust of wind fueled by the sea of hate I had for this Imp and all evil that now pressed in around me.<br>
<br>
    What the challenge that this Imp had brought did for my mind the cold water splashing on my face did for my body. I now had to find out all that I could about him and his kind.  Where to start?<br>
 <br>
    Just then another knock on the door. &quot;Hey there Kat, I brought you some breakfast&quot; the voice was deep and yet contained a cheerful welcome.  &quot;Thank you Slaor&quot; I answered. &quot;Leave it outside the door please&quot;. <br>
 <br>
     Then and idea came to me, I reached out with my thoughts to Slaor. &quot;Do not come in,  I am in need of your help though.  Please seek out Kygero I need her to make contact with her darker alliances.  Ask her to seek out information on Imps and in particular Safvas if possible. Do this quickly and quietly I will be at O'Berton's Study find me there when she has returned with the information Do not make physical contact with me from now on&quot;.<br>
<br>
     I turned and said bitterly to Safvas &quot;If I am your master then I bid you to come with me to O'Berton's Study now!&quot;  Safvas surprised by my change of direction, but pleased by the fact that he would be in a familar place agreed.<br>

Questions ran through my mind . What possibly could he want with me. It is highly unusual that he should even know who I am. I do not run in the social circles nor boast of my achievements that he should take notice of me.<br>
<br>
Then I heard voices approaching the doors. It was High Lord Tiggyr, &quot;Then it is settled  I shall announce your Knighthood  this afternoon.&quot; The heavy doors swung wide and the beautiful Ambystoma stood within them beaming from ear to ear. <br>
<br>
&quot; Aha, Slaor we have something to discuss,&quot; Tiggyr said &quot;but first lets congratulate the lady Ambystoma on her new position as Knight of the Bronze Dragon Fellowship.&quot;<br>
&quot;Congratulations Amby, Um I'm sorry Lady Ambystoma.&quot; I said blushing at my mistake &quot;I know that this is an honor you have set your heart on for some time.&quot;<br>
<br>
Unable to contain herself any longer she through her arms around me and kissed me, then ran down the hall cheering thank you, thank you ,thank you.<br>
<br>
&quot;Now theres one happy druid, aye Slaor? Come in now and we'll talk&quot;<br>
<br>
The sound of the massive doors latching behind me brought with it a sense of  seriousness.<br>
<br>
&quot;Throughout this ordeal with the Plague Bringers you have been a mystery to me Slaor .&quot; he started &quot; From nowhere you seem to come and yet you seem to know when help is needed most and you are there. You fight bravely and with fine skill, yet you have no reputation as a warrior. We owe you our thanks in saving Lady Katreena's life when attacked by Fravak in the woods, but you tell no one of this deed. You serve others without complaint, and ask nothing in return. Tell me Slaor just who are you? For if  I am to make you a knight I need to know.&quot;<br>
<br>
I stood dumbfounded and fumbling for words. No one had ever spoken to me in this manor before. After a deep breath I began to speak. &quot; My name is Slaor Frostlander my lord.  I come from the city of Halas in the land of Everfrost. . I grew up poor and alone in both the material world and the spiritual world.  I was a lost and wandering soul when I first met the fair Lady Katreena. She taught me the ways of mother Tunare and in her I saw the kindness of the Bronze Dragon fellowship. I joined the Bronze Dragons Family not to take from them their kindness but to give to them all that I have gained from the kindness of just one member. I can not even begin to repay the debt I owe to Katreena ,and the fellowship&quot;.<br>
<br>
&quot;I am a loner preferring to travel the open lands and meditating on the ways of Mother Tunare. Avoiding the crowded and confusing cites. So you may not have heard of me, but the residents of the hills and plains look  warmly upon me knowing they are safe for the night while I am around and that is all  the reward I ask.&quot; <br>
With that I fell silent and waited for his reply<br>
<br>
&quot;You sound as if you're an ambassador already Slaor but this request is for Knighthood.&quot; He paused then continued &quot;I see good things in you Slaor and I see no reason for you not to be a knight. Congratulations.&quot;<br>
 <br>
As he bent over his desk and signed the request I spoke up &quot;I'm sorry My'lord but I have no desire for this position, this Knighthood.<br>
<br>
Openly surprised at my boldness he looked into my eyes saying &quot;You do not wish to be a knight Slaor, most  people would sell there souls to obtain this honor. Though then they would be ineligible.&quot; he smirked &quot; So why do you refuse?&quot;<br>
Ashamed for having spoken out of line I lowered my head. He reached out and raised it again saying &quot;Slaor when you are in my study never be afraid to voice your disagreements. now tell me why do you feel you are not worthy of this appointment?&quot;<br>
&quot; My lord it is not that I may not be worthy, that is for you  to decide. It is that I do not desire to be in the public eye. I am not eloquent in speech nor am I versed in the politics of the guild. You could say my lord it is because I am shy &quot; I said sheepishly feeling a warm blush  come to my face.<br>
&quot;Hah well  then I suppose that ambassador is out to&quot; he chortled &quot;Yes I can sympathize with you. I am finding out just how burdensome it can be in that public eye as you call it.&quot; More seriously now he continued &quot;How then shall you be rewarded for your loyalty and bravery?&quot;<br>
&quot;I do not know my lord. I don't even know how my name came to be considered for knighthood.&quot;<br>
He picked up the petition that he had just signed and handed it to me.<br>
In it I saw many of my achievements and deeds that I had thought had gone un noticed. As my eyes fell to the bottom of the page there was a very familiar name. A lump began to swell in my throat as I stare at the name. <br>
He broke the silence &quot;This is an officer that I hold in very high esteem Slaor. Her word alone is enough of a recommendation even with out seeing your achievements.&quot; I still could not speak. &quot;I can see  you also hold a high regard for my lady.&quot; <br>
Regaining my composure I summoned enough strength to say &quot;I would die a thousand deaths in defense of my lady's faith and honor. I owe that and more to her my lord.&quot;<br>
&quot;Then you shall have the chance Slaor. My lady has stated that she puts great faith in your advice and trust you with her life . Therefor I shall appoint you as such. As of now you shall be the personal Advisor and protector of our very adventurous lady Katreena.&quot;<br>
&quot;I thank you my lord. I will protect her with my life, but the advice only comes through me my lord it is from Mother Tunar, it is not my own&quot; <br>
 I left his study feeling as if a burden had been lifted an another placed upon me. Perhaps breakfast would would calm my uneasiness. After some fruit and bread I felt much better. I thought to my self perhaps a nice breakfast would help cheer up Lady Katreena as well. She had been in such a depression since her return. I quickly gathered fresh food and some flowers to take to her chambers. On my way down the hallway I passed kygero and Lady Kuvanu. I bowed as they passed but they seemed intent on there conversation and passed me without notice.<br>
As I reached Katreenas door I sensed a change in the air, it was charged as if spells had been cast and a faint smell of burnt flesh. Had there been trouble, I wondered. Another spell sounded down the hallway and the squeal of a rat told me that the house elves were busy rounding up these pest and destroying them. My mind set at ease I knocked on the door saying &quot;Hey there Kat, I brought you some breakfast&quot; With great anticipation I awaited her reply. I knew she would be happy with the news of my appointment, and I longed to talk with her as we had so many times in the past.<br>
&quot;Leave it outside the door please&quot;.  she replied. <br>
Something was wrong. I herd in her voice, a quiver, an odd tone.<br>
 I quickly set down the tray and grabbed my mace. As I took hold of the door handle her voice entered my mind sayng &quot;Do not come in, I am in need of your help though. Please seek out Kygero I need her to make contact with her darker alliances. Ask her to seek out information on Imps and in particular Safvas if possible. Do this quickly and quietly I will be at O'Berton's Study find me there when she has returned with the information Do not make physical contact with me from now on&quot;.<br>
For a moment I was frozen there with my hand on the latch. My impulses said charge in, but my mind said wait. I tightened my grip on my mace ready to charge. <br>
 A sudden calm cane over me and my mind cleared. I felt as if  I were floating outside myself. Then another voice came to me. &quot; Do not intervene Slaor for this is my plan. You cannot save her now, be pachant and do what she ask of you. There well be another day for heroism and on that day your faith in me will be rewarded.&quot;<br>
<br>
Reluctantly I turned from the door and set out in search of Kygero. <p>Your humble servant and personal advisor to Lady Katreena Slaor Frostlander <img src= http://members.home.net/soyouthinkiam/eq/Slaorsig_1.jpg border=0></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub5.ezboard.com/uslaor.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Slaor</A> at: 1/10/01 8:06:49 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cac3ab><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub5.ezboard.com/ukatreena.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Katreena</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>BDF Officer</span><br>  Posts: 471<br> <font color=#c54400>(12/27/00 8:55:57 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://members.home.net/soyouthinkiam/eq/Kat/images/Katpix.GIF WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Looking for O'Berton's Study</span><hr size=1>         I moved to the bed and arranged things so that if someone looked in on me they would think that I was still asleep. <br>
<br>
          I cast Superior Camouflage on Safvas and myself, I opened the door carefully, smelling the the aroma of food I bent down and picked up the breakfast that Slaor had left for me. I packed the food into my backpack and put the flowers on the table next to my bed.<br>
<br>
        I stepped through the door and out into the hallway.  There was an air of celebration through out the passages as the Plague Bringers where considered defeated. Everywhere there were the familiar faces of my Bronze Dragon Fellowship family. Smiling, talking to one another rejoicing. I would catch bits and pieces of their conversations.  I found myself wanting to join them, to join in their innocence of the evil that now had again come to me.  I knew that their ignorance of my situation would lead to all kinds of rumors, once it was discovered that I had left. <br>
<br>
         On to the forgotten part of High Hold Keep keeping Safvas and myself hidden from all, friend and foe alike. Now the halls were dark and forbidding, smelling of sour dusty death.  My skin crawled as I again entered the now deserted rooms that where once O'Berton's home.  Memories of Farvak came flooding back bitter tears stung my eyes, the thoughts of all that I had lost.  &quot; No not now I had no time for this&quot; I told myself  &quot; I now had to keep my mind in the here and now.  In the moment.  That was then and it was and is gone forever. Enough!!&quot; I scolded myself.<br>
<br>
I found a flint and stone and lit a candle then started slowly moving around each room lighting the sconces.  I was searching for O'Berton's private rooms and study, this was where I would make camp. Looking for anything that could teach me about Safvas.<br>
<br>
        Safvas would fly around each room teasing me, swooping down pulling at my hair and clothing.  Laughing at my blundering progress.  &quot;Nothing here for you my tasty little Druid, not in this room&quot; he would whine.  &quot;Feed me and I will show you what you want&quot;  I glared at him and stubbornly kept searching.  <br>
<br>
        &quot;Oh your such a sweet tasting elf, how I remember your blood.  Please Kat just a sip ooh I'm so hungry&quot; he begged his black eyes gleaming. His face made even more sinister by the shadowed candle light. <br>
<br>
        &quot;You can starve!You leach bat&quot; I spat back.  &quot;I don't need your help&quot;.  <br>
<br>
         &quot;Oh but you do my sweet, I know of all the secrets here and will not tell you till I have tasted your blood again&quot; he chortled  <br>
<br>
        I turned and left the room cursing under my breath swearing like one of the lost bandits on the planes of Karanas.   Just then I felt an arm grab and pull me close holding me tightly.  The sharp edge of a blade  was at my neck.  The intruder smelled my hair and I could feel their hot breath on my face as they spoke in whispers.  &quot;Bet you never thought you would see me again aye Pet&quot; <br>
<br>
        My eyes flew wide, anger filled me, I could smell his all to familiar scent.  His muscular body up against my back holding me closely.  Just then Safvas flew into the room he looked straight into Farvak's eyes and laughed.  <br>
<br>
        &quot;You were the fool who killed me&quot; he hissed.  Those black eyes now had glints of red fire in them.  &quot;You will let her go now!&quot; Safvas commanded &quot;Or you will meet Innoruuk in person&quot;  Farvak lowered his blade but didn't let go instead he turned me to face him and smiled &quot;You have the luck of all Gods Kat but one day you will pay for your betrayal&quot; He pushed me roughly to the floor and stared at both of us.  He made no attempted to leave and it was I who moved back away from him, my mouth open in shock. My mind screamed You are Dead. <br>
<br>
        Safvas then said to me, evil in his voice &quot;Kiss Farvak&quot;.  I turned to look at him and said hatefully &quot;NO!&quot;  My body started to tremble and my blood boil my thoughts twisted.   I felt my body rise from the floor and walk to Farvak.  My mind screaming &quot;No&quot; But my lips found Farvak's.  I could feel the warmth of his lips against mine. Our eyes met then I quickly pulled away. Shame filled me<br>
<br>
         Farvak then looked at Safvas, now evil shown in his eyes to matched that of Safvas'.  As understanding came to Farvak, he said grinning &quot; She is under your control then?&quot;  Safvas said charmingly &quot;Yes, but she would not have done that if somewhere in her heart of hearts she didn't want to&quot;<br>
<br>
        Farvak's smile widened with this information. He said to himself  &quot;I knew it, I knew it when she couldn't watch me die that she loved me!&quot; <br>
<br>
        I stood there gaining control of myself. Guilt filling me with the realization of the situation.  Bitterly I glared at the two.  Denial would be foolhardy, but another key to the puzzle was given.  I turned and walked away from them, busying myself with the search for O'Berton's study.  Thoughts running through my mind hating myself and them for what had just happened. <p>Your very own Spam Girl & Adventurous Woodelf <BR>Katreena Wanderheart 42nd Leaf Master Brewer <BR>

&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The hours past and my mood became as edgy and dark as this place.  Safvas and Farvak stayed close by to keep an eye on my progress.  They whispered quietly just low enough so that I could not hear their plans being made as they followed me from room to room. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I found my way to the bedrooms and closed the door  and locked them out, or so I thought.  I turned to the room and looked around.  I needed time to think, to clear my thoughts of past actions and concentrate on finding O'Berton's study.  I paced the room lighting candles as I went.  Then turned to open the doors to the balcony I stepped out and took a breath of fresh air.  Hoping that this would ease my discomfort and clear my head.  The sky was growing dark.  Mother Tunare had used her many colors to dress the sky in deep pinks and dark purples as twilight settled over High Hold Keep.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I stood there watching the changes in the sky.  It soon grew to cold to stay out on the stone balcony.  I felt better but tired and turned go back into the dark musty room closing the doors behind me.  I laid on the bed quietly waiting for sleep to overtake my thoughts once more.  <br>
<br>
         I was troubled by the fact that I had kissed Farvak and that deep in my heart somewhere beyond my conscious mind I had a dark desire for him.  I could not understand how any part of my being could be so twisted, for wasn't it he who killed my beloved family.<br>
<br>
         Visions of my Father touching my hair, my mother sweet smiling face, my brothers disapproving glances, my sister who moved with grace and beauty.  Then there was the ache and emptiness left by the loss of My husband, my love, Caddil and the child I would never know.  Then if this wasn't enough the loss of the innocence that he took from me that night in Kithicor wood. Was it true that the line between love and hate was so fine as to confuse the mind?  Is it that they are emotions born of the same place in the heart?  <br>
<br>
         It was now that sleep found me dreams released thoughts to the wind.  I found myself sitting on the side of the bed  with Farvak lips kissing the back of my neck.  He was holding my arm out for Safvas to drink my blood and one arm around my waist.  I was not fighting but delighted in the lust that I felt. I was also above this scene watching, horrified by it.    Suddenly struggling to breath I awoke in terror.  <br>
<br>
        &quot;Oh, Mother Tunare Please find me, cleanse my heart and mind of this tormented evil that has betrayed even my soul&quot;.  I pleaded as I prayed.  I felt so lost, alone and beyond the help of even Her.  I had to find the strength to fight this thing in me that was drawn to the evil that was now tempting me to the darkness.  <br>
<br>
         I stood up and paced the room, admonishing myself for being so self centered.  I would do what needed to be done to Destroy the Evil in Norrath at every turn that was my destiny, that was all that mattered.  I opened the door committed to finding O'Berton's study to find the means by which to destroy this Imp, Safvas, and Farvak once and for all. <p><img border="0" src="http://www.goodnet.com/~saxon/full-logo.gif"><img border=0 src=http://bronzedragonsite.homestead.com/files/tags/katreena.gif><BR>

Salvas said &quot;Listen Farvak you may yet be one who sits on the right-hand side of Innoruuk if you help me with Kat.  You will have your revenge and the Power you seek.&quot;  <br>
<br>
Farvak listened with new interest yet never turning away from watching the movements that Kat was making.  &quot;Oh, yes now there is an offer worth my attention&quot; he replied.  &quot;Go on&quot;.  <br>
<br>
Salvas continued &quot;She needs to be turned from the Light of Tunare&quot; Farvak interrupted with frustration &quot;You don't think I have tried to do this?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Listen Farvak your ways are only giving her more reason to stand in the Light.  Your the only man who is capable of turning Katreena willingly to the dark side.  But you must forget this rage and passion and quietly seduce her.  Tempt her with the seeds that you have already planted.  Pretend to change your heart to match her ways, always keeping yourself out of her reach.  Help her fall softly into  the darkness, help her to turn from her Bronze Dragons to you for advice and companionship.  Only satisfy her lust and desire when she is willing to let me feed from her&quot;.   <br>
<br>
Farvak grinned watching Salvas with suspicion. &quot;Oh and all of my help is so that you can drink her blood? Here have some of mine if your so hungry.  I want to destroy her completely, soul, spirit and mind&quot;.  Salvas hissed &quot;Fool,  I am not hungry I need her for my masters plans. Willingly she must serve us.  You will have all you desire here and in the Life awaiting you with Innoruuk if you do this&quot;.  <br>
<br>
Farvak rubbed his chin and chortled &quot;What makes you think that I have the ability to seduce Kat?&quot;   Salvas grinned &quot;The kiss,  just now proved that she has a desire, a lust for you already.  Small though it may be it is there and needs to be fanned like and ember to bring it to a flame&quot;.  Farvak and Salvas then turned the corner to find a door being locked between them and Kat.  &quot;Well, seems as if my job is going to be a bit harder than both of us planned&quot; Farvak laughed &quot;but one that I will enjoy till the end&quot;.   <br>
<br>
 Salvas then beckoned Farvak to follow him &quot;Come we must prepare O'Berton's study for her.  They walked down the dark hall together.   <br>
<br>
In O'Berton's study Farvak and Salvas were looking through the piles of books scrolls and papers. They put the ones that had any information that might help Kat to learn of ways to defeat them in trunks and locked them away.  Salvas explained as they sorted &quot;We will feed her things slowly only let her have enough information to spark her interest and keep her distracted while providing your willingness to help her.  <br>
<br>
Farvak then came up with an idea &quot;Salvas, let me send for my servants to help, they can be of great service to us while under the guise of keeping the place cleaned up&quot;  Salvas said &quot;Yes, this can work to our advantage, Good Point&quot;  They continued with their task to clean out the study.  <br>
<br>
************************************************************<br>
<br>
I walked down the dark hall listening to the rats scuttle around the corners away from my view.  The cob webs and dust made the air thick and hard to breath, or maybe it was just my mood.   I then sensed something, using my tracking skills I could just make out the movement.  There beyond a wall was something to big to be rats although you could consider this a rat of sorts.   <br>
<br>
I searched the wall for the secret to the entrance to this room.  It wasn't long before I found it.  I thought of camouflaging myself but the cast would give me away and I needed to see what Farvak and Salvas were up to. <br>
<br>
 Quickly I steeped in to a room that was lit by a fire in the hearth, a large chair with it's back was in front of it.  There was lantern light making the shadows deep in the corners. But there was no doubt that this was O'Berton's study. <br>
<br>
 Books lined the walls in shelves from floor to ceiling scrolls seemed to jut out of every available nook.  Then there was the desk, heavy, hewn from a massive piece of Treant wood, magic exuded from it.  Papers here were cluttered amongst the bottles and vials.  Salvas was behind it on the back of a chair that had provided the owner with a place to sit.<br>
<br>
  He looked up at me smiling &quot;Oh Kat you found us, I guess I won't taste your blood for this clue&quot; he said with mock disappointment.  Farvak said from the chair at the fire &quot;Hello so good of you to join us.  Did you rest well, my  love?&quot; <br>
        <br>
<br>
I felt the anger rise, heat flushed my face,  &quot;I am nor will I ever be your love, Farvak!&quot; I said as cold as any a winter night in Everfrost.  I moved behind the desk to the chair and sat down &quot;As for you Salvas you will dye of hunger before I let you feed from my body again.&quot;  I began rifling through the papers, seeing that there were different languages used I started sorting them by that cleaning an area where I could start.  <br>
<br>
I felt a twinge and my blood start to boil as it had before when Salvas had ordered me to kiss Farvak.  I said without turning to him &quot;Yes, Salvas you wanted my attention?&quot; There was defiance in my tone but a quiet calmness that let him know that  I still had some choice in what I was going to do.  Salvas spoke with an almost gentle hypnotic tone &quot;I don't want anything but to serve you Katreena.  May I bring you some wine and food&quot;  <br>
My eyes fixed on a paper concentrating to keep control of my actions I said &quot;Do what you will Salvas.&quot;   Salvas then hopped down from his perch and walked -hopped -flew out is claws making clicking sounds on the stone floor.  <br>
<br>
I returned to my filing of the scrolls and papers in front of me on the desk.  I didn't notice that Farvak had gotten up and move behind me.  He placed his hands on my shoulders.  I sat up, stiffened and said through gritted teeth.  &quot;Never place your hands on me again&quot;, but at that moment he started massaging the tight muscles in my neck and shoulders. And as soon as the words left my mouth he stopped and removed them, taking a step back he said gently &quot; I am sorry to offend you Kat&quot;  He then took care of the fire, placing another log on and left as Salvas came in with food and wine.  <br>
<br>
I was surprised that Salvas had found anything in this place that was deemed eatable.  But the wine was sweet and the Cheese, fruit and bread tasted wonderful.  I paid very little attention to Salvas as he watched me.  Soon he stretched his wings and yawned sleepily, tucking his head down he soon seemed to drift off.  <br>
<br>
I worked at trying to disphyer the writing on some of the scrolls,  I had some abilities in differed languages but most of these scrolls were of an old tongue.  Frustration had set in as I sipped another glass of wine.  The room seemed to brighten as the hours past from eerily morning to daybreak.  However, I too, seemed to drift in and out as sleep was overcoming me.   My mind lost in a cloud of wine and exhaustion felt my body being lifted by strong arms, floating. Then lips warm and close to mine, breath on my cheek hands that gently brushed my body,.  Words whispered softly &quot;I love you Kat. How I want you to know that I am truly sorry that things happened the way they did.  Let me show you how much I love you&quot; then again deep sleep overtook me.<br>
  <br>
I awoke my head pounding,  I was in the bedroom I had locked myself in the night before.  The hour was late, night had come with a storm and the rain made a soft plat plat plat sound against the doors to the balcony.  I moved to the bowl of fresh water and a towels to splash my face, wash the sleep from my eyes.  I couldn't remember when I had slept so deeply without dreams.  Now all I felt was my head aching from the wine that I had had to much of.  <br>
<br>
I combed my hair and straightened my clothing before going to the door to listen for any movement on the other side. <br>
<br>
To my surprise there were voices and the sounds of many footsteps then Farvaks voice giving orders whoever was out in the hall.  I opened the door and to my surprise I was looking into the face of a familiar dark elf, one that I had seen at Farvaks house in Nektulos forest.  She was carrying fresh linen and  supplies.   <br>
<br>
Farvak said with a  growl &quot;See you have awoken the Mistress foolish girl&quot; I quickly replied  &quot;No she did no such thing&quot; as I moved between them to take his wrath off of her.  He said amusingly &quot;Kat as a Mistress you must learn to treat those beneath you with little or no value&quot;.   &quot;How dare you treat anyone as though they are beneath you! She is doing her job the very orders you gave her.&quot;  I seethed.  His grin widened as he saw my anger take flight on him &quot;OOH,  Yes that is it, You've got it now.   Just treat them like your treating me now you have it Kat&quot;   I heard her say softly behind me, &quot;it is all right mam really&quot;  She bowed and entered my room.   <br>
<br>
Farvak was leaning against the wall chuckling as he watched me.  &quot;Kat you are a beauty but when your angry you are breath taking&quot;<br>
<br>
I blushed and brushed passed him, I could feel the warmth of his body close to mine. His eyes watching my body as I passed him.  I quickly headed off towards O'Berton's study to  resume my search in the mass of books scrolls and papers.  I passed a few more servants on my way there.  Only one stopped and spoke, &quot;Mistress what may I bring you,   too too eat for dinner?&quot;   I said &quot;Just some wine, cheese and bread, thank you&quot;  I turned to enter the study as he left.   <br>
<br>
There was Salvas perched on the chair by the fire, that had been burning for some time.  I lit the lantern that was on the desk and began my chore.  &quot;So, Kat do you like what Farvak has done, does he not please you.  He is a fool in love and only wishes to make you love him, you know&quot; Salvas spoke  his eyes closed but his voice was more than awake.   &quot;That will never happen and as for you, your day is coming. Your downfall is in my future&quot; I said assuredly.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Ah, yes the Kat who brought down the blessed Plague Bringers.  You do have a strong will to serve your Mother Tunare, but where was She and her Light bringers when Caddil was in need.  What of the Great and Mightily Bronze Dragons where was their rescue.  I do believe that it was only you Kat who did anything till the last moment.  Wasn't it you who lost it all, your family your love your child?&quot;   He said factually.  <br>
<br>
Bitterly I said &quot;It is not for you to ever speak their names, You are not to do so again!&quot;<br>
<br>
Salvas said coldly &quot;Poor Kat, she is the only one who has sacrificed and yet she doesn't see that it is she who is used by Mother Tunare and those who follow so blindly the Just and Righteous.  Farvak lives, Iszabelle is back to serve as well.  See me I have lost nothing because of your sacrifices. It is only you Kat that is the stone cold truth that has lost anything in this battle you choose to fight.  You choose the wrong side, even now!&quot;<br>
<br>
I could not say anything to refute these words, so I sat quietly.  A bitter knot in my throat and a deep stabbing pain in my heart.  I fought back the tears that dared to well up even now.  <br>
<br>
The silence was broken by the servant entering with food and drink.  He quickly placed it on the desk and left.  I poured a glass of wine and drank deep and quickly hopping to dislodge the lump in my throat. Seeing that this wasn't going to happen I turned my attention back to the scrolls and translating them.<br>
<br>
Hours must have passed, the wine was gone the food uneaten and I was more than a bit drunk.  Falling into a sleep my head on the desk.  When again I felt myself being lifted from the chair.  Warm strong arms held me, gently close to a strong muscular chest.  I nuzzled the neck of my would be hero and whispered with a slur &quot;Thank you&quot;.   Then his lips where close to mine touching them softly.   His hands  brushed lightly my thighs then my stomach, then my cheek.  Whispered words his breath against my neck &quot;Katreena you will one day love me, as I love you&quot; the voice deep and gentle with a kindness that reached into my heart. <br>
<br>
 I tried to wake up but it wasn't till very late the next day that I arose. Again the headache was blinding, my mouth dry.  Again back to the Study back to my work, Frustration  now seeping in as I was getting no where with any of it nothing about imps nothing about the dark forces.  I spent my nights working and days sleeping off the effects of a drunken wine induced sleep.  <br>
<br>
It was just when I had given up hope of finding anything that Farvak entered and spoke to Salvas I was deep in efforts to translate a very difficult document when Salvas left.  It was then that Farvak stood behind me and dropped a piece of paper in front of me.  My eyes widened as I stared at it.  I gasp as I started to read the bits I could.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh, oh thank.&quot; I stated to say, then realized who I was going to thank.  &quot;What is the cost of such a bit of information, Farvak&quot; I said suspiciously.  &quot;Just the smile on your face, Kat&quot; came his reply.   He sat down in the big chair in front of the fire watching me.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Then thank you, where did you find this?&quot;  One of my servants in cleaning out an old part of the building came acrossed it. I hope that it helps&quot;  He said   <br>
<br>
&quot;Oh, and why help me destroy the very thing you worship?&quot; I replied  <br>
&quot;I have my reasons Kat&quot;  he said with almost a tone of disgust.  I did not press farther.  I was to eager to try and figure out the information that was on this small fragment of paper. <p><img border="0" src="http://www.goodnet.com/~saxon/full-logo.gif"><img border=0 src=http://bronzedragonsite.homestead.com/files/tags/katreena.gif><BR>

The sounds of familiar voices echoed about, even his own study was being used.  A sweet scent had also made its way through the old and dusty hallways of his tower.  Using his magic’s to conceal himself in the early hours of the morning. O’Berton called upon great magics forgotten by most to blanket the hallways with a morning mist, a mist that has powers over creatures from the lower planes of hell.  O’Berton relaxing now, knowing that Safvas and most others would not be able to resist the sleep they now were succumbing to began to move about his holdings.  Moving to his study O’Berton saw the small frame of a humanoid bent over his desk.  She was sleeping softly; looking about the room O’Berton noticed several changes to the contents.  Several key books had been moved and locked away.   Why would this be he wondered, why hide books on controlling creatures and manipulating elemental forces, why?  Glancing about O’Berton saw a tiny little figure on a shelf sleeping away, Safvas.  What was he up to now?  If he had taken control of Katreena he must be planning on something and she must be a tool of his.  Glancing back over at Katreena and wondering if she had the mental fortitude to resist the imp, O’Berton quickly summoned a pen and a small piece of parchment.  Quickly writing a note down explaining to her that if she wants help to write her answer on the parchment and leave it in her pocket for none other to see.  Plus O’Berton quickly described how she could mask her true thoughts from Safvas. <br>

I sat up and looked around the room and found fresh warm water awaited my use along with fresh towels. <br>
<br>
 I stood up unsteadily, the cold floor giving me the reason to move quickly to the dresser.  I bathed slowly enjoying the feeling of being clean.  If only one's heart could be as easily cleansed, I thought.  There was fresh clothing laid out on the end of the bed so I stepped out of the pile at my feet and dressed.   Then picking up the soiled clothes I searched the pockets to see if I had hid the paper that Farvak had given me there.  &quot;Ah&quot; I was not so drunk to forget that little snippet of a clue.  I sat down and was surprised to find that the paper was not the one I thought.<br>
<br>
Finely written was a note that read &quot;Katreena, your very soul is endanger of being lost to Salvas. You are in need of information to help you to succeed in escaping his hold on you.  The following will help you in blocking your true thoughts from him.  I give you this to show you that I can be trussed..  You will need to know more and I can supply this if you are willing.  You need to write your answer on a paper then place it in your pocket.  I await your response.  O'Berton&quot;  <br>
<br>
There was a name that brought a shiver to my hole body and mind.  Here was another of the Plague Bringers back from the dead.  Curses filled my mind. &quot;Damn them all! Salvas was right I was the only one who had lost anything!&quot; Anger and resentment filled my head.  &quot;I had been so Foolish to believe that I mattered to any of them. Mother Tunare and her promises had been just to spur me on. Only to bring about success for her purpose.  The Bronze Dragons were they not just as guilty&quot;  I then looked into the mirror and saw my reflection there  &quot;Kat, bitterness will fill you and you will be destroyed by it&quot; I reprimanded myself. <br>
<br>
I sat on the bed staring at the note, studying the writing as if to see if there was some meaning between the words that would give me a clue as to the true intentions of the writer.  &quot;O'Berton  why would he help me now? How did he get the note into my pocket and when? Would the instructions there really keep Salvas from my mind?&quot;  I pondered these questions for a long time. &quot;Trust O'Berton?! That was like trusting Farvak!&quot;   I decided that I had nothing to lose from attempting what was given here,  then I would see about answering the note.   <br>
<br>
A knock on the door broke my study and I quickly pocketed the note as I answered. &quot;Who  is it?&quot;  Farvak's voice from beyond asked &quot;Are you okay Kat you haven't ventured to the Study today?&quot; <br>
<br>
 I answered flatly &quot;I do not have to check in with you as to my plans for the day, do I?&quot; <br>
<br>
Farvak entered &quot;Kat, stop this!&quot; <br>
<br>
 I glared at him &quot;Now you come into my room any time you choose! Remind me to lock that door from now on.&quot; I spat back.<br>
<br>
With this he backed out apologizing.  &quot;Kat, your right, I should never have entered without your bidding me to come in&quot;  <br>
<br>
This took me aback as I had never seen Farvak back down from anything or anyone.  &quot; I am,&quot; I began &quot;I'm sorry, I have a headache.&quot; I explained  &quot;Thank you for your concern. I am not fit company nor would I be able to accomplish much in the Study now.  I will try to go later&quot; I said.  I surprised myself by my sudden change of tone with Farvak. <br>
<br>
He answered through the door &quot;My I bring you something for your headache. Please let me help you&quot; it sounded like true concern. <br>
<br>
 &quot;I am not sure&quot; I replied &quot;I truly would like this pain to be gone&quot; Farvak entered asking for forgiveness for this act &quot;Kat, please let me help.  You haven't been taking care of yourself, not eating, too much wine and working to hard.  I am surprised that your not sick&quot; He approached me turning me around he started massaging my shoulders.  His hands warm and strong, yet gentle.  He moved his hands so that his fingers found my temples and lightly massaged my head.   <br>
<br>
He then spoke softly &quot;Kat you need to leave here for a time, go to a forest regain your composure and strength.  But where?&quot;  Let me talk with Salvas and see if he will not be willing to let you travel to Nektulos forest.  I believe I can convince him of that journey&quot;<br>
<br>
Again my mind was blurred and thoughts seemed to fade in and out as I agreed without realizing that I had answered.  It sounded to tempting and I did long for the green glades and meadows, tall trees and grass.  Not since Caddil had I let anyone take control of my life and I longed to be taken care of again, to let go and let someone else make the decisions.<br>
<br>
Farvak asked &quot;There now your feeling better, yes?&quot;  I was surprised to find my headache had left and answered &quot;Yes, thank you I think I will go to the Study now&quot;.  He bowed gave me a smile  &quot;Ah a pleasure to serve my Mistress&quot; then left the room.  <br>
<br>
I once again found myself in the study under Salvas's watch.  It was time to try and block him from my mind, to see if O'Berton's instructions would prove to be truth.  I started then pulled out the piece of paper Farvak had given me from under the rest of the papers there and began again to translate the writing.  I waited for Salvas to ask me about what I was reading. No response came.  I then tried to turn my thoughts to Slaor. Salvas still sat studying my actions without a reply, my blood did not boil nor did I feel any compulsion to tell Salvas anything.  <br>
<br>
It was Salvas who broke the quite of the Study and spoke &quot;Farvak says that you need to take a break from your work here and I couldn't agree more&quot;  I turned to him and looked shocked &quot;What?&quot; I asked.  I had forgotten about Farvak's plans to take me to Nektulos Forest.  &quot;Oh that&quot;I brushed it off &quot;It was just a desire nothing more than a whim I don't think I want to go now.&quot;  I waited to see if Salvas would see the rush of longing that had stirred in my mind.  Then I felt it, my blood boiled and my mind being lost to his control.  &quot;Okay, I will go then&quot; I answered frustrated by the lack of control over my own thoughts. <p><img border="0" src="http://www.goodnet.com/~saxon/full-logo.gif"><img border=0 src=http://bronzedragonsite.homestead.com/files/tags/katreena.gif><BR>

Ah....<br>
<br>
Sitting at the enterence to the Nektulos Forest is Bowszer.  He sits there with a large mug in his hand, retreating it from his mouth after a healthy swig of mead.  &quot;MMMMMMM!  Dat good!  Me likes!&quot;  He tosses the mug aside, nearly hitting a dark elven passerby in the process.  Bowszer doesn't seem to notice.<br>
<br>
Coming up the way is Farvak and Katreena.  Bowszer looks up and sees he immediately recognizes her.  He can see that she doesn't look altogether happy.<br>
<br>
&quot;Katweena, helloooo!&quot;, Bowzser bellows in his big, deep, monstrous voice.  He stands up and waves.  Farvak looks up, only to see the massive size of this troll practically standing before him.  &quot;Damn!&quot;, he says as he hops back drawing is sword.  Bowszer smiles at him.  &quot;Ooooh, little human wanna play!  You's funny!&quot;  He looks over to Kat.  &quot;How you be?&quot;  Farvak takes a swing from his sword and Bowszer parries him with his gigantic Leg-Chopper blade, carrying on his conversation with Kat in the process.  Katreena says, &quot;If I wasn't with him, I'd be alright.&quot;, she says in a somewhat snide tone, looking his way.  Farvak tries to slash again, and as Bowszer looks over, he parries again, lightly pushes him back with his index finger (which is still about the size of half his body, at least).  As light as the push was, it still knocked him over, but not enough to hurt him.  &quot;You mind?&quot;  Bowszer snaps at Farvak.  &quot;Me talking!  You be annoying now. Me EAT YOU, you does dat again!&quot;  He, then, turns to Katreena again.  &quot;So, dat not yer frend?&quot;  As Kat was about to answer, Farvak snaps, &quot;We are on a sort of date, you could say.  Not that it's any of YOUR business, troll!&quot;  Kat turns sharply to Farvak and yelling, &quot;You bite your toung!&quot;<br>
<br>
Farvak gets up and begins to stomp off into the forest.  &quot;C'mon, Katreena.  We have no time for this!&quot;  Katreena sighs and, with a solemn tone, follows.<br>
<br>
They get to the mouth of the forest, and Farvak says as he turns to Katreena, &quot;Now follow m....&quot;.  He's interupted only to find that Katreena was followed.... by Bowszer.  Bowszer smiles at him.  Farvak snarls, &quot;What the hell do you want?&quot;  Katreena turns to find her big, green freind and manages to crack a grin.  &quot;Me wants ta come wit!  Me wants ta see Kat be okay, and me wants ta see da funny lil' dark elfs in da darkie city, and...&quot;<br>
&quot;SHUT UP!&quot;, Farvak hollars.  &quot;Jeez, you're obnoxious!&quot;<br>
&quot;Me's bigger den you, too.&quot;, Bowszer states with a mischevous grin.  &quot;And me thinks you be gud wit da cabbages.&quot;  Bowszer starts to chuckle as he licks his lips at Farvak, and Farvak's eyes widen.  He begins to back up slowly, saying in stutters, &quot;If y... you come along... y.. y... you'll regret it!  K..Kat.. let's go!&quot;, and he runs off into the woods.  Katreena chuckles a moment, then sighs.  &quot;I have some business to take care of with Farvak.  I will come back to see you soon okay?&quot;  Then she whispers, &quot;I'll keep in touch and tell you if I need your help, okay?&quot;  Bowszer nods.  Katreena smiles.  &quot;That's my big strong hero!&quot;  She giggles, and waves as she disappears into the forest. <p>Bowszer, da Troll<BR>
Me one of da Bashers!<BR>

The servants there easily kept  the movement of the chest containing the information a secret as Salvas could and did erase their memories of this.  <br>
<br>
The only good that came from this distraction was that once again I had trees around me and Mother Tunare closer than she had been in days as I walked through the Commons.  <br>
<br>
We arrived in Nektulos Forest and I was ready to turn around and leave when a familiar voice boomed out.  This could only be the voice of Bowszer a giant of a Troll, who's heart was bigger than he was, if you were on his good side.  However, Farvak was not impressed by the humor my friend had and soon was cursing under his breath.  Bowszer soon got the better of Farvak's patients.  This did delight me and I found myself grinning the rest of the way to Farvak's home remembering the look on Farvak's face as Bowszer had told him &quot;He would be Tasty with Cabbages&quot;.  <br>
<br>
The trip for Farvak was to gather supplies and a few more servants to bring them to O'Bertons hidden Keep.   Soon it was time for us to return there and for me to continue my quest for knowledge of the dark forces.<br>

Lightning flashed across the dark sky as if trying to shout out to me to leave this place and never return.  As we walked along the path under camouflage I let my mind seek out Slaor for any news of Kygero.  In actuality I was seeking out anyone that was family or friend.  <br>
<br>
My heart had grown heavy with the thought that I was returning to such a battle.  Salvas and Farvak had taken their toll on my spirit and even with the break to Nektulos forest I was feeling more than venerable.  The only hope I had of keeping the forces of evil at bay was the information that O'Berton had supplied to me.  I was still unsure that I had been given a gift or a trap.  As we closed in on our destination I found my mood to change from apprehensive to dark and irritable.  Farvak seemed more than cheerful enough as we arrived. <br>
<br>
I took my leave and headed to the Study in hopes to keep my mind from analyzing the situation.  I was more than disappointed to find Salvas there grinning with that all knowing smirk to watch over my every move there.  I turned and left to go to my bedroom.  <br>
************************************************************<br>
<br>
Salvas argued with Farvak &quot;She will not be under my control if you take her from my side.  However, I can always find her and bring her back should you, shall we say, lose her&quot; <br>
<br>
 Farvak said &quot;Salvas, look this will give you the secrecy you need to move the chest and she will be grateful to me for taking her out of here to her beloved forest even for a short time.  A kill two wolves with one arrow so to speak move&quot;  <br>
<br>
&quot;Okay&quot; Salvas agreed &quot;However, let me warn you if you make one mistake it is your life you forfeit here Farvak&quot;   Farvak waved him off saying &quot;yes, yes, yes and I will pay dearly been there done that. So what is new&quot;.  <br>
<br>
It wasn't till Farvak saw Bowszer that he had his moment of truth.  He thought to himself &quot;Shit, who the hell is this big obnoxious troll and how the hell does he know Kat? Great just great, Kat's friend so if I kill him, I blow it with Kat and Salvas. Damn it all. Just get her away from him for now and deal with this later&quot;<br>
<br>
The rest of the journey went without a hitch still the Troll had thrown Farvak  for a loop.  &quot;What would this little slip cost me&quot; he thought. But the incident was soon forgotten with the return to High Hold Keep.<br>
<br>
Kat seemed a bit edgy but that was to be expected now she had had a taste of freedom from the work she was so diligent to carry out.  Farvak thought as he watched the wood elf &quot;A wild free thing like a Fay Drake so beautiful you wanted to possess it for your own however to possess it would kill it.  Yes this did describe Kat.  However there was one person who did just that,Caddil.  How ever did he get her to  marry him?.  He was strong, and served the light, but what had he done that had caught Kat like a moth to a flame?&quot; Farvak couldn't for the life of him understand.  <br>
<br>
After things where settled Farvak knew he had to report to Salvas so off to the Study to bring Kat some wine that was tainted with herbs to make her sleep. This allowed Salvas and Farvak to make plans and carry them out without Kat becoming suspicious of their movements.  She was smart and very aware of all that was going on around her. <br>
<br>
When Farvak entered Kat stormed out of the room heading down the hall with a look of disgust on her face.  Farvak entered an said &quot;What now?&quot;  Salvas sat grinning and shrugged &quot;She must not have liked your trip&quot;<br>
<br>
  Farvak turned and followed after Kat watching her and wishing she would show him her fire and rage.  This was truly a passionate woman as he well knew. He had worked hard there in the Overthere to bring her to anger and knew just how to trigger her beautiful fire, she was alive with it.  He found himself lusting to touch her body and see her fight him. &quot;One day soon he would have her again&quot; he thought wishfully. &quot;Soon&quot;.   Till then he had to watch her. To create in her a lust for him yes a longing that would burn in her so hot that she wouldn't be able to stop herself when the time came.  Farvak thought again &quot;yes, soon&quot;<br>

Bright white light.  I could not identify where it was coming from.  There was an eerie chill across my face and my skin as there with nothing more then a pair of trousers torn around the edges, tied around my waste with a rope.<br>
<br>
'There was a female voice, yelling.... crying for help.  I ran toward it, and she appears closer to me, as if she were an illusion.  And her face... her face... it's so familiar.  Could it be?  It was Katreena.  As she got so close to me that our noses practically touched, I saw a tear fall from her eye as she yelled for help once more, and everything faded into white as she seemed to disolve in the brightness.<br>
<br>
'Now the clouds where white, and the brightness is still eminant.  Before me now was a set of crude stone stairs, wide and only three in count.  As I look up these stairs, I see two stone pillars with crossbeams, and crusified upon them by ropes was Iszabella on the left, and Katreena on the right, and both nude.  Iszabella had her head bowed down, showing no expression, whereas Katreena looked frightened.  As if I wasn't spooked enough, I noticed they both had a few lashes of a whip across thier stomach areas.  Even though this is something I would imagine Iszabella herself administering such tortures, even I felt pity upon her, as well as and especially Katreena.  From the right side, Farvak appears and approches Katreena.  He begins to kiss her neck and starts feeling her around in a risque manner, and the expressions Katreena protrayed were that of anger and, only once or twice, a spark of lust and desire, but go back to anger.  She'd would sternly tell Farvak to get away from her, but he continued.  My jaw dropped.  Iszabella finally turned her head to them and hisses at him, sharply saying, &quot;TRAITOR!  Farvak, you damned traitor!&quot;  Farvak, without so much as flinching, much less even looking up, throws a dagger at Iszabella's throat and stabbing into her dead on quicker then I could blink.  She bled from her throat and died that instant.  My eyes diverted back to Katreena as she moaned, then said softly, &quot;No... I really don't want... I do.... no...&quot;.<br>
<br>
'Tears started to fill my eyes as I tried to hollar, &quot;STOP!  You won't defile her!  STOP AT ONCE!&quot;, but my words were not heard.  They could not be heard.  It was as if I was talking, but no sound was coming out of my mouth.  I tried to charge, and the moment I did I felt a tug at my arms.  I look back and notice two dark elven women, both dressed in red langerie, had nabbed me.  They had started feeling me around.  I tried to tell them to stop and ask what the meaning of this was when they both evily smiled at me, and I saw lengthy sharp fangs!  Just when I started to struggle, they came at me, blackness, then....'<br>
<br>
&quot;AAAAHG!&quot;<br>
<br>
Lyrick sits up sharply on the bed he was using while on Sisterhood Island in a cold sweat.  He was awestruck by what he saw, and he was frightened beyond beleif.  The evil and slightly erotic nightmare repeated in quickness as his mind raced and his heart beating so fast from fear and worry that you'd think it would burst from this chest.  A knock on the door... &quot;Mr. Highwood?&quot; says a gentle female voice from outside of it.  Lyrick takes a deep breath and say, &quot;Come in.&quot;  Entering the sylvan cottage is very attractive brunette wood-elven lady; obviously on of the Sisters of Erolisi.  She asks as she pours a cup of tea, &quot;Is everything okay, sir Songweaver?&quot;  She hands Lyrick the tea and he sips it.  &quot;Yeah...&quot;, he says solemnly and nods.  &quot;Yes, I'm fine.&quot;  She smiles and says, &quot;Well, you are here to relax and you don't look like you're doing that.&quot;  She giggles a little bit.  &quot;Plus, it's not often someone as handsome as you comes around, you know.  You look better with a smile on your face, and any one of use will tell you that!&quot;  Lyrick blushes a little bit, but knows that she's only saying that for to attract patronage, aside from the enlightening of her goddess.  &quot;You're very kind to say so.&quot;  She smiles, takes the empty teacup, and just as she's about to leave, Lyrick asks, &quot;When does the next boat leave?&quot;  She puts on a slightly pouty face as she says, &quot;Aawww, leaving already?  You've only been here a day.&quot;  She beams Lyrick a sweet grin.  &quot;Please, won't you stay a little longer?  We are having a small party amongst us, and we always welcome your kind.&quot;  Her grin grows to a smile.  &quot;I'll even be your date, if you like.&quot;  Lyrick chuckles shyly.  &quot;Um... as much as I appreciate the offer and invitation, I'm afraid I have a matter of urgency to tend to.&quot;  She nods and says, &quot;Next vesel should be about in an hour's time, I beleive.&quot;  Lyrick gets up out of the bed, half dressed in his evening wear.  &quot;I need to get dressed and make sure I'm packed.  Thank you kindly, Vaelara.  You have been most hospitable.&quot;  He bows in thanks and drops about 5 gold in the teacup she was holding.  &quot;Here.  A donation to your church.&quot;  She smiles at Lyrick, gives him a small kiss on the cheek, and tells him, &quot;Thank you.  I'll try to see you off.&quot;  And with that, Vaelara leaves the cottage.<br>
<br>
An hour later, Lyrick boards the boat, both Vaelara and the Sister who mans the dock wave him off and wish him a well journey.  During the boat ride, he thought of that dream and what it could mean.  He remembers the trouble the Plague Bringers caused with the BDF, and he's heard things said about Katreena running into some trouble of her own.  He had no details prior to the nightmare, and somehow he feels Katreena to be in a very definate danger in more ways then one.<br>
<br>
He arrives in Freeport, and he plays his drum to the tune Selo wrote for quick movement.  He ran to the last place he remembers seeing her last.  Highpass Hold. <p><P>Cheers...</P>

With conflicting emotion I walked on to find Lady Kyegro . I had just seen her in the dinning  room I think yes with Lady Kuvanu. I hoped they were still there. I was in good luck for as I turned down the hallway to the dinning room I saw her emerge. As she came my way I hailed her &quot; good morning my lady.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Morning Slaor &quot; she replied &quot; I saw you with a Tray of food Earlier Was that for Katreena perhaps. &quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Why yes how did you know?&quot; I asked <br>
<br>
&quot;Well every one else has eaten, and besides I don't think that you would be giving Banlaen Flowers do you.&quot;<br>
  <br>
&quot;Well I guess you caught me there&quot; I said a  little emarrassed<br>
<br>
&quot;How is Kat today doing any better? She he seemed to be having a restless sleep when I checked earlier.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Indeed she has my lady but she seems to be getting better each day. She is even showing some interest in beginning some new research I said &quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Oh  and what might that be?&quot;<br>
  <br>
&quot; imps.&quot; <br>
 <br>
&quot;Imps? &quot; she said looking puzzled and confused.<br>

My mood had become dark as I walked over to the doors to the balcony and opened them.  The lightning flashed jagged streaks across the ominous black sky. Who's clouds had become boiling as they made their way over High Hold Keep.  The thunder roared and shook my body with its cry into the night.  So much this storm was like my mood always threatening to deluge the ground with a wash of rain, so my tears were to my soul. Relief and release were but a heartbeat away but never seemed to come. <br>
<br>
   I had mindlessly undressed my clothing lay at my feet, I stood naked to the storm waiting for the rain.  A chilly breeze blew gently across my face and brought goose bumps to my skin and still I stood there waiting.  Another flash across the sky another roll of thunder and still no rain fell. The air tingled with the promise of rain, the very ground seemed to beg for it.<br>
<br>
I hear a voice from behind me &quot;Kat, what are you doing?&quot; it was Farvak. <br>
<br>
   I turned and looked at him blankly then said slowly &quot;Why? Why me I am not important to anyone, I have no family now, no one will come for me, so why do you or Salvas care that I am a tool. I am nothing&quot;  His eyes hungry lingered on every curve of my body as if to touch the naked exposed skin.  But my words caught him off guard.  He looked into my eyes questioning the tone of my remarks. <br>
<br>
 I spoke again hopeless &quot;You and Salvas want me then take me for I have no more will to fight you. No more will to serve anyone&quot;<br>
<br>
He then seemed to understand and moved towards me saying &quot;No Kat not like this,  I don't want you like this, dead inside&quot; He held me in his arms and gently guided me to the bed.   Saying softly &quot;Kat it will be all right, soon enough.  Here have some wine&quot; he poured me a glass and held it to my lips the bitter sweet taste filled my mouth and warmed my body as it made its  way down my throat. But I was still cold and felt dead inside.  Tears had filled my eyes and I  laid there as he covered me.<br>
<br>
I had at last drowned in the evil that was all around me.  The pain that was in my heart had left my soul as parched as a desert.  I felt no desire to fight the raging storm that was trying so hard to overtake me.  The lessons I had learned over the last fight were tough and I had lost so much and yet the evil still was strong.<br>
<br>
  The Bronze Dragons even though they had claimed victory over the Plague Bringers had paid dearly with the departure of loved and dear sisters and brothers.  And more were leaving daily the cost was to great for my spirit to bear.<br>
<br>
  And Mother Tunare seemed to have forsaken me to the evil that I had so vigilantly fought against.  Losing my family, my husband, my child, my future  and still the evil was there. To what end was this battle being waged?  In who's eyes was the evil being judged?<br>
<br>
Farvak lay beside me holding me trying to find someway to comfort the pain that now poured out onto him by the way of tears falling from my eyes. This weeping was silent as the spirit was giving up and dying.   The room was silent and filled with a melancholy mood  as he prompted me to drink more wine. <br>
 <br>
At last I heard the rain fall with a flat, plat, plat, plat against the stone of the balcony only then did I fall into a drunken sleep.<br>
************************************************************<br>
<br>
Farvak entered the study eyes filled with rage &quot;Salvas you have what you want! Kat is willingly giving herself to us, but not the way you think.  She will die if she stays here any longer&quot;  <br>
<br>
 Salvas looked up sleepily from his perch &quot;What is this your saying Farvak? She is willing to let me feed from her&quot; <br>
<br>
 Farvak spat at Salvas &quot;We have broken her  to the point that she no longer fights for anything, she is dying from the inside out&quot; <br>
<br>
 Salvas licked his lips and started to move towards the door.  Farvak put himself in the way and said  &quot;Yes go drink her blood you will kill her and she will be useless to your master. You will have failed him again&quot;<br>
<br>
  Salvas cocked his head eyes now wide giving his attention to Farvaks words.  &quot;Isn't this what you wanted to see Kat broken completely, to see her destroyed mind, body, spirit and soul?&quot;  <br>
<br>
Farvak pulled out his blade &quot;I killed you once I can do it again&quot; he threatened.<br>
  <br>
Salvas smiled &quot;Not without killing, Kat&quot;<br>
<br>
  Farvak hissed &quot;She is already dying you fool&quot;<br>
<br>
It was then that Salvas questioned Farvak &quot;What, she is ill? What is wrong with her?&quot; <br>
<br>
Farvak said with gritted teeth &quot;If we do not act quickly to breath life into her spirit she will die.  I have seen this and caused it myself in many. But to see this happen to her is beyond what I can stand! Damn you and Damn me for not seeing her falter down this road to her own death.&quot; <br>
<br>
Salvas said warily &quot;Tell me then what can we do to change this situation with Kat?&quot;<br>
 <br>
Farvak thought for a long time and then answered  &quot;We need to get her to Lesser Faydark to her forest and even then we may be to late&quot; <br>
<br>
They made plans to move all of O'Berton's things to Mistmoore Castle where Salvas would be comfortable and Kat could easily be watched as she roamed Lesser Faydark.  Farvak made contact with Xicoti, a brother Shadow Knight, and by early the next day the move had begun.<br>
************************************************************<br>
<br>
It was late morning when I awoke, my head pounding the rain still falling outside washing the world clean.   <br>
<br>
It was Farvak who was gently brushing the hair from my face. Smiling down at me he said &quot;Kat we are moving to Mistmoore.  You are to take a leave to your Lesser Faydark&quot; I looked dully into his face and replied flatly &quot;Yes, okay&quot; and sighed &quot;As you wish&quot;<br>
<br>
Getting up and facing him, I let the covers fall from my still naked body and moved to gather my clothes I no longer cared what Farvak saw or what he wanted to do.  I no longer cared.<br>

I could tell she wasn't ready to go back, but she did seem to have more energy and was almost happy at being back in the woods.<br>
<br>
The servants were ordered to set up camp near a large Cutthroat Dervish outpost. I went to pay a visit to a couple of old friends at the outpost while the servents prepared food. After trading stories and downing several mugs of ale, I saw Katreena comming over the hill. <br>
<br>
&quot;Good evening my pet.&quot; I called to her.<br>
<br>
&quot;How DARE you call me your pet!&quot; It was good to hear that rage in her voice again. My desire became almost too much to bear. &quot;I will never be yours!&quot; Katreena turned, stomped back up the hillside, and sat down under a large tree with her back to me.<br>
<br>
I knew it would do her good to sleep under the stars. I took a bottle of elven wine and a loaf of bread from the Dervs and went up the hill. &quot;Kat, I'm sorry you feel that way.&quot; I said as I put a hand on her shoulder. I could feel her muscles tense up, but I didn't remove my hand. Just that small touch filled my with desire. She pushed my hand from her shoulder and started to turn around. I quickly stepped back and held out the wine for her. &quot;You must be hungry and thirsty. Take this and I'll see you in the morning.&quot; Katreena looked suspicious but took the bottle. I quickly kissed her cheek and started down the hill. <br>
<br>
Halfway down the hill, I heard her faint reply: &quot;Thank you.&quot; I grinned but didn't look back. Soon, she would give herself to me willingly.<br>
<br>
-----------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
A week later, I could feel something was wrong even before I noticed the door to Katreena's room in Highkeep was cracked open. Slowly, I eased the door open and saw her standing out on the balcony. I could feel the fire in my heart grow as I entered. A quick look around and my heart began to sink. The food and wine on the table were untouched, her clothes were in a pile just inside the balcony doors, and Katreena was standing outside in the cold air completely naked.<br>
<br>
&quot;Kat, what are you doing?&quot; I asked. As she turned, the sight of her body almost made me forget the reason I was here.<br>
<br>
&quot;Why? Why me I am not important to anyone, I have no family now, no one will come for me, so why do you or Salvas care that I am a tool. I am nothing.&quot; The dispair in her voice forced me back to reality. Something was terribly wrong! Salvas had pushed her too far with his control and obsession to taste her blood again. The trip to Neriak hadn't done her as much good as he had thought.<br>
<br>
I could tell this was not an act. She was dying inside and he had to do something fast. Damn that Salvas! He would pay dearly if Katreena died.<br>
<br>
I lead her to the bed and poured her a glass of wine. If nothing else, it would make her sleep. I could feel her tears as I worked out a plan to get her back to the forest. That was the only place she would be able to recover, if at all. When, at last, she fell asleep, I stormed to the study to deal with Salvas. <br>
<br>
After a lot of talking, Salvas was convinced Katreena was dying and something had to be done. I cashed in every favor I had to get Xicoti to agree to let us stay in Mistmoore for a while. Although he was a friend, the big Ogre didn't like guests. I hoped the dark elf outpost in Lesser Faydark would be able to watch over Katreena as she recovered.<br>
<br>
-----------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
I awoke all of the slaves and had them load up our essential gear. They were moving too slowly to have everything ready by dawn. &quot;Get to work NOW! I don't care if it's 2:00 in the morning!&quot; I grabbed the nearest slave, a young dark elf girl, and wrapped my hands around her neck. She screamed in agony at my icy touch. Stopping just short of killing her, I dropped her quivering body to the ground. I couldn't afford to lose any slaves. There was still too much work to do. &quot;Who's next?&quot; I shouted at the servants that stood around with horrified looks on their faces. Immediately, they started scrambling to prepare our things.<br>
<br>
<br>
I went to wake up Katreena while Salvas paid a wizard for transport to Greater Feydark. We arrived at the great stone spires as the sun set. After nightfall, we headed out towards Lesser Fey. Katreena walked like a zombie, and seldom even looked up. Halfway to the Lesser Fey pass, Katreena stumbled over a tree root and didn't try to stand again. &quot;Are you hurt, Kat?&quot; I asked. <br>
<br>
&quot;It wouldn't matter if I was.&quot; she replied faintly. She didn't resist when I reached down and picked her up. Katreena soon fell asleep in my arms as I carried her down the path and through the pass in the mountains.<br>
<br>
&quot;Fravak? Is that you???&quot; Kayla Nybright called as we approached a small camp near Castle Mistmoore. <br>
<br>
&quot;Kayla, you old Derv! What are you doing out here?&quot; Fravak called as they arrived at the camp Kayla and her sisters has set up. Kayla bounced up to Fravak and kissed him passionately over the top of Katreena's as she slept.<br>
<br>
&quot;Father kicked us out. It's a long story. Who's your friend?&quot; Kayla asked, her hands on her hips.<br>
<br>
&quot;Her name is Katreena. I was hoping you could do me a favor and take care of her for a little while. She needs the woods to help her recover.&quot; I laid Katreena down on a cot in Kayla's tent and came back out to the fire.<br>
<br>
&quot;I suppose so, but I thought I was your girl.&quot; Kayla said, sticking out her lower lip and batting her eyelashes. &quot;I didn't think you were into those goody goody druid types either.&quot; Glancing back to the tent, she said &quot;It looks like you rode her a little too hard. How about staying here for a while. You know you can ride me as hard as you like.&quot; Kayla traced her fingers down the front of my black armor. <br>
<br>
I grabbed her hands tightly with one of mine and pull her hair back sharply so she looked up at me. &quot;How could I forget? Too bad you stabbed me in the back and left me for dead in Qeynos. We could have been great together! You're just lucky it took me weeks to recover and that I couldn't find you. I would have loved torturing you to death.&quot; I kissed her again and let her go.<br>
<br>
&quot;Heh. It was just a little misunderstanding.&quot; Kayla grined.<br>
<br>
I grinned at Kayla and lowered my voice. &quot;Kat and I go way way back. It's imparative that she gets better. Please take care of her. I'll owe you big time.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh my god! You're in love with her!&quot; Kayla's eyes widened in suprise. &quot;Someone has finally broken that stone heart of yours.&quot; She jabbed me in the ribs.<br>
<br>
That made me think for a moment. &quot;No, no, not love. Although she does have anger that makes you look like a saint.&quot; I winked at her.<br>
<br>
&quot;I find that hard to believe. We'll take care of her. I'll also be thinking of how you can pay me back.&quot; An evil grin crossed Kayla's face. &quot;Where are you going with so many servants, if I may ask?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Castle Mistmoore. I wanted to be close to Katreena as she recovers.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;And not to me? I'm hurt!&quot; Kayla said.<br>
<br>
&quot;I promise I'll be back to see you both soon.&quot; I swatted her on the rear end as I yelled for everyone to head out. Castle Mistmoore was less than an hour away.<br>

Salvas had made it impossible for me to be in the Study with him. My blood would boil so with the desire to let him drink from my veins that I would become dizzy, that and he had teased me about hiding books.  Even the secret O'Berton had given me had been of little use against Salvas's probing mind.  Then  when he filled my thoughts with visions that were my memories of Caddil, but instead of Caddil it was Farvak's face I saw, my heart could stand no more. I know not what happened after this for days.<br>
************************************************************<br>
<br>
I awoke to the sound of women talking, light heartily in friendship, musical notes filled the air.  The air itself smelled of life, trees and grass, the sweet musty smell of a forest and food cooking over an open fire.  I waited to open my eyes and have this too be a dream, wanting to hold on to the moment.  <br>
<br>
I heard one of the women say &quot;Farvak is sure to stop by today and check on her.  I can't wait to see him again! Damn, he is one fine man.  Just thinking of him makes me drunk with lust&quot; the giggles were seductive.  <br>
<br>
I opened my eyes wide with the mention of his name.  I  looked around quickly assessing my new surroundings. I moved quietly, getting dressed, I discovered I was in a tent comfortably set up for a long stay.  Warm furs covered the beds and chest of simple necessities were  used as tables.  I looked around to find a weapon that I might use against any danger or enemy, none was to be found.<br>
<br>
 It was she that was surprised as she stepped in and discovered that I was up and awake. &quot;Well, Hello there! Good to see your up.  Come out and eat when your ready&quot; She said with a grin.  She backed out and called over her shoulder &quot;You can take a bath later, I will show you where&quot;  <br>
<br>
I straightened my clothing and put my hands through my hair to comb it out as best I could as I stepped out of the tent.  My eyes opened wide with delight, I breathed in the sweetness that was the Lesser Faydark, &quot;Mother Tunare bless me, I am home.&quot; I thought.   I sighed and stiffened my resolve as I watched the three women at the fire.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Good marrow to you ladies&quot; I greeted.<br>
 <br>
They were all three high elfs from the city of Felwithe, all bore a resemblance to each other.<br>
<br>
  &quot;My name is Katreena Wanderheart of Kelethin&quot; I introduced myself.  <br>
<br>
They bowed their heads in my direction and I returned the nod.  Their clothing was not of the fine silken robes of their fellow Felwithians, but leathers such as mine.  They had the look of  women who could take on even the toughest of warriors. <br>
<br>
&quot;My name is Kayla and these are my sisters&quot; the more formidable of the three said with a grin. &quot;Come warm yourself by the fire and have a bite to eat&quot; she welcomed me. <br>
<br>
The other two looked my way, not one of welcome but not a threat either, more one of distaste.  I was a Woodland Elf and these were High Elfs,  I was considered to be beneath their kind. I approached apprehensively not wanting to offend my hostesses.<br>
<br>
 I ate quietly and watched the three women wondering what had lead them to live in the forest, for this way was not the way of the High Elfs of Felwithe.  They lived in one of the most beautiful cities on Faydwer.  Marble halls and well dressed, wealthy men and women all, all of good blood and standing. <br>
<br>
 It was Kayla who spoke first &quot;Oh were are my manors.  I am Kayla Nybright we are the treacherous Nybright sisters of Felwithe. Our father is shamed by our actions as thieves. He has declared us dead to him&quot; she said with a laugh to her voice. <br>
<br>
My eyes opened wide when Kayla said that they were the Nybright Sisters.  I said &quot;Your father offers a reward for your deaths there is a price on your heads.&quot; <br>
<br>
 They all turned and then snickered &quot;You have heard of us then?&quot; <br>
 <br>
I answered   &quot;Oh, I spoke with your father, who asked that I kill you and return your pearls.   I was shocked by his words to say the least.  What kind of father would do such a thing to his own daughters.  I do not blame you for your fall, but him!&quot;<br>
<br>
Our eyes met and then we all laughed, music filled the forest like birds singing.  &quot;Well then, should we watch our back with you Druid?&quot; Kayla said half  teasingly. <br>
<br>
 &quot;No, but your father should be watching his&quot;  I chuckled &quot; I think your father should be the one that is hunted down like the dog he is.&quot;   They all nodded in agreement and smiled at me. Kayla said &quot;Welcome, Katreena you do us honor by staying with us for a time&quot;  <br>
<br>
 I replied &quot;I am so honored by your generosity&quot; and bowed to each. &quot;What may I do to help you tend your camp. <br>
<br>
 Kayla smiled and said &quot;You are to rest here and regain your strength Kat. That is all we ask of you.  For in doing that you will insure that Farvak will pay us well&quot; <br>
<br>
With the mention of Farvak's name I stared down into the fire and grew silent again.<br>
<br>
  It was Kayla who spoke next.  &quot;Now about that bath It will be cold but at least you will be clean.  Follow me&quot;   I got up and did as she bid me.  Quietly through the familiar forest to a pond. <br>
<br>
 &quot;I will be close by, should you need anything&quot; Kayla offered.  I shook my head yes that I understood that I would be watched discreetly.  <br>
<br>
I undressed  and dove into the cold water, the feeling was sensual as the water caressed my body.   I loved the water, to swim was to free my body from its own weight.  Washing the dirt of the last few days from my skin, I smiled for the first time in days.  I relaxed and let the water hold me as I floated lightly to the top. Looking up into the deep of the blue ski I closed my eyes and let go of all thoughts.<br>
<br>
&quot;Kat&quot;  came a whisper, as a hand touched my body.  I opened my eyes startled by the touch.  Only to look up into Farvak's eyes, deep and longing, his lips curved in a smile. Nothing else was said.. I put my arms around his neck and pulled myself to him, his chest warm against mine I looked into his eyes seeing him welcome my touch.  <br>
<br>
I whispered seductively &quot;Is this what you want&quot; as I let my fingers make slow circles down his back.  I gently kissed his lips biting at them softly. <br>
<br>
He sighed &quot;Yes as his hands moved me closer to him&quot; I backed away and grinned teasingly and turned around in the water slowly.<br>
<br>
  Then spat with all the  hate, fire and rage  I  had possessed  &quot;Good! because you will never have me like this, Never!&quot;.  I returned to the shore gabbed my clothes and stomped off to the tents. <br>
<br>
<br>
Kayla walked down into the water and snickered slyly at Farvak &quot;Well, I see what you mean by spirit!  Now that your hungry may I fulfill your desires for now.&quot; <p><img border="0" src="http://www.goodnet.com/~saxon/full-logo.gif"><img border=0 src=http://bronzedragonsite.homestead.com/files/tags/katreena.gif><BR>

She hit the ground hard and pulled Fravak on top of her. Sitting up, he started unfastening her shirt. Kayla started pulling at Fravak's belt as he bit at her ear. Kayla purred and scratched at Fravak's back. &quot;You can't imagine how much I'd like that right now, my pet, but I have an urgent errand that I must attend to.&quot; With that, he bit at her neck hard enough to make her yelp and then stood up. &quot;This will have to wait until I return.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;How dare you tease me like that! I should have killed you when I had the chance!&quot; Kayla screamed while Fravak walked away. She threw a large rock at him, just missing his head by inches.<br>
<br>
Fravak turned and, still tucking in his shirt, said &quot;I know you love to be teased. It's a good thing your aim is still as bas as always.&quot; Kayla threw another rock at him, missing by over a foot.<br>
<br>
He picked up his pack, ducked another rock, and quickly headed down the trail towards Steamfont. Kayla was still screaming behind him. He was still daydreaming about her soft skin and painfully sharp fingernails when he arrived at the pass to Steamfont. Shortly, Fravak arrived at the entrance to Ak'Anon.<br>
<br>
&quot;Halt human! You are not welcome here.&quot; the two guards, barely taller than Fravak's knees, blocked the entrance.<br>
Fravak resisted the urge to strangle the nearest guard and, instead, showed him the medallion that hung from his neck. The guard gasped and backed away from the entrance. <br>
<br>
&quot;That's more like it. Try to stop me again and Meldrath himself will drag you to his lab.&quot; The guards glowered but kept their distance. Fravak entered and demanded to the nearest clockwork that it take him to the necromancer's guild at once. <br>
<br>
&quot;Iszabelle was a fool to trust in you&quot; the small skeleton sitting across the table from Fravak said in an errie voice. &quot;What makes you think I will follow that same path?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;My lord, Iszabelle's own selfish plans brought her down. She severely underestimated the power of the Bronze Dragons. I know you would not make that same mistake.&quot; Fravak stared into eyes of death itself but did not look away.<br>
<br>
&quot;You will fail as she did if you aren't careful&quot; the skeletal figure hissed. &quot;You will have my allegiance as long as it suits my plans, but you first must bring me the research notes Iszabelle used to create the plague she tried to unleash on the Bronze Dragons.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Those notes were taken to Highkeep! It will take weeks to travel there. My lord, may I humbly ask for transportation to shorten the journey.&quot; Fravak wished Katreena could have taken him, but he could tell she still needed time to recover. He didn't have anything to threaten her with to make sure they had safe passage.<br>
<br>
&quot;Very well. You shall travel with the dead.&quot; The skeleton held out a finger and Fravak reached forward to touch it. Fravak screamed as the icy cold pain shot through his body and reached his heart. His last vision before the darkness grew and his heart stopped was that of the table rushing up to hit him in the face. <br>
<br>
As suddenly as it started, the pain disappeared. Fravak opened his eyes and, although there was no light, he could see the walls of a sewer cast in an errie violet glow. Slowly, he reached a hand up and put it on his chest. Fear overtook him as he realized his heart was not beating. &quot;Yer Dead! Stop looking so scared.&quot; said a gnome who was working at a nearby table. &quot;You'll come back to life soon enough.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Where am I?&quot; Fravak asked as he sat up. He looked down and noticed he was floating half an inch above the table.<br>
<br>
&quot;Freeport. In the Master's guild.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;He did it then. I must be going.&quot; Fravak grinned and got up off the table, realized he had been in this area of the sewers before.<br>
<br>
Fravak traveled swiftly and without fatigue as he crossed the Eastern Commons. Passing a small orc camp, he began to feel a tingling in his arms. He was comming back to life and needed to sit down. Confulsions overtook him as he started to breath again. Soon, his vision cleared enough to see the figures in front of him. A fierce battle between a band of orcs and a group of dwarves and high elves was underway. Fravak blinked a couple of times and realized he knew one of the dwarves. A young recruit of the Bronze Dragon Fellowship named Mikeybigarms. <br>
<br>
Still feeling weak from returning to life, Fravak shot Mikey an evil grin and continued on his way. Soon, he would have to come back and teach this young dwarf about the mistake in joining the Bronze Dragons.<br>
<br>
Upon reaching Highpass, Fravak found the notes and used the last of the money Safvas had left to purchase a teleport to Greater Faydark. Stepping into the shadows, he headed back to Castle Mistmoore to tell Safvas about the deal and to secretly duplicate Iszabelle's notes.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Where have you been?&quot; Safvas demanded even before Fravak had closed the door to the study. &quot;You couldn't have spent a week with those gnomes! Did they agree?&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;No. They refused to join in your petty quest. Looks like we're on our own.&quot; Fravak could feel his blood begin to boil at Safvas's probing and resisted as best as he could. &quot;Get out of my head you stinking Imp. I have nothing to hide from you. I will talk to them again soon.&quot; Fravak tried to change the topic. &quot;How is Katreena doing?&quot;<br>
<br>
That seemed to work. &quot;She is doing much better and was seen this morning laughing at the campfire with Kayla.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Good. Maybe I should go pay her a visit.&quot; Fravak's eyes were filled with lust as he left the study. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub5.ezboard.com/fbronzedragonfellowship75394stories.showMessageRange?topicID=78.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub5.ezboard.com/fbronzedragonfellowship75394stories.showMessageRange?topicID=78.topic&start=41&stop=48>3</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub5.ezboard.com/fbronzedragonfellowship75394stories.showPrevMessage?topicID=78.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub5.ezboard.com/fbronzedragonfellowship75394stories.showNextMessage?topicID=78.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub5.ezboard.com/fbronzedragonfellowship75394stories.threadControl?topicID=78.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/slate/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub5.ezboard.com/fbronzedragonfellowship75394stories.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=78.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub5.ezboard.com/fbronzedragonfellowship75394stories.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=78.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub5.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="bronzedragonfellowship75394frm13">Picture Gallery<option value="bronzedragonfellowship75394flames">Flames<option value="bronzedragonfellowship75394announcementreadonly">Announcements<option value="bronzedragonfellowship75394events">Events<option value="bronzedragonfellowship75394suggestions">Suggestions <option value="bronzedragonfellowship75394applicationformembership">Candidates for Membership <option value="bronzedragonfellowship75394tradeneeds">Needs/Trades<option value="bronzedragonfellowship75394criminallisting">Criminal Listing<option value="bronzedragonfellowship75394stories">Stories<option value="bronzedragonfellowship75394membersonly">Members Only Discussion<option value="bronzedragonfellowship75394frm11">Guests<option value="bronzedragonfellowship75394frm12">Trade Skills<option value="bronzedragonfellowship75394frm15">Members Only Bulletin Board<option value="bronzedragonfellowship75394frm16">Links<option value="bronzedragonfellowship75394frm17">Roleplaying Games - Misc.<option value="bronzedragonfellowship75394frm18">The Gathering<option value="bronzedragonfellowship75394frm19">Academy of Dragons<option value="bronzedragonfellowship75394frm20">Polls</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#c54400>- </font><a href=http://pub5.ezboard.com/bbronzedragonfellowship75394>Bronze Dragon Fellowship</a><font color=#c54400> - </font><a href=http://pub5.ezboard.com/fbronzedragonfellowship75394stories>Stories</a> <font color=#c54400> - </font><a href="http://www.bronzedragons.org">Home</a><font color=#c54400> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.101<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.<br>Accelerated By <a href="http://www.wbs.com/ezboard.html">JXEL</a></center></body></html>
