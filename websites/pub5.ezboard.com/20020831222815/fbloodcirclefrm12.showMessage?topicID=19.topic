The purpose was<br>to give some limited insight into the how and why of her.<br>Zer, therefore, seemed like the perfect person to put it all in<br>perspective, as the story itself will show.  As for the feel<br>of the account, after reading as many fantasy novels as I have,<br>some of it is bound to rub off on an amateur.  There are at least<br>six different series of books that this reminds me of.  -_-;;;<br><br>As a final note, the formatting I want for this story will not<br>keep, no matter how I try.  <sigh>  Gomen nasai in advance.)<br><br>Sometimes, a person cannot tell their story.  Sometimes they will<br>not tell it.  However, it is just as possible that there is a<br>need for the story to be told, without embroidery or self-<br>importance, to gain a better understanding of what a life means.<br>My name is Zeruel Tenken, and this is not my story, but rather<br>the story of a foundling, who once was lost, was once given<br>guidance, and yet remains lost.  You know her, though she could<br>just as easily be someone you have never met before.  Perhaps no<br>one will be better for my telling of this story... or perhaps<br>just the right people will be.  And if you never see me again,<br>this truth has lead to my death, as I always knew it might.<br>There are, after all, some powers better left uncontested-with,<br>and some stones better left unturned.  Kawaii soshite kawaisou<br>onna, this is the truth of a tale that she once tried to tell.<br>She is the one alone, who rejoices in excellence.  She is the<br>shadow over a dream.  And this is her story, as she told it,<br>but with the truth of others interwoven.<br><br>... Perhaps it will take a Tier'dal to truly understand the<br>nuances of a story so wrapped in the tensions of a dark, yet<br>somehow beautiful race whose blood I share.<br><br>          - Zeruel Tenken<br>            Introduction from "Lost Children of Tunare"<br><br>There is, in every legend, a seed of truth...<br><br>                          Shadowdream<br>                Of the life of Tokio Kageriyume<br>                 (edited by Zeruel the Tenken)<br><br>     Simply put, I was a mistake.  Let me try to explain...  I was<br>supposed to be born to the magic, to necromancy and the service<br>of Innoruuk.  This request was made of my mother by Xon Quexill,<br>and she swore to comply.  I have no pity for her...  No, not even<br>because she was killed for my birth.  More the fool she for<br>accepting the command of a male.  Please do not take this to mean<br>that I fail to understand the power men can bring, but as what it<br>is - a simple statement of fact that in such an ultra-matriarchial<br>society, there was not a single thing preventing her from scoffing<br>in his face, or just killing him where he stood.  I was never told<br>who the father was.  (I still can't think of him as mine.)  I<br>don't know if he ended dead for his failure as well, or if he<br>simply continued to live on in namelessness.  In either case, I<br>was alone.  I was not built for the life of a warrior or a rogue,<br>nor did I evidence the skill in healing required for clerics.<br><br>     So, without the spark of magic, or the physical requirements<br>to become a simple fighter, my days were empty.  (Yes, I know<br>I skipped over the first three or so years of my life.  We're not<br>tested for aptitude in magic until four, or didn't you know that?<br>Besides, how much is there truly to say about years that blend<br>together in the memories of the ageless such as the Tier'dal?)<br>I spent most of my time wandering about the Commons and the Third<br>Gate, guiding those who asked to the Necromancer guild.  I met many<br>who likely went on to make a name for themselves in the world at<br>large, but I was too young to remember their names, or likely to<br>have even asked them.  At the time, after all, it was quite<br>unimportant to me.  During this time, I saw many people of various<br>race taken to the guildhall of the necromancers, and never did any<br>of them return.  What happened I did not see, but anyone should be<br>able to fathom a reasonable guess at the fates of those unlucky few.<br>The few times I was so inclined, I even took to swimming around the<br>'moat' that surrounds the cleric guildhouse in the Third Gate.<br>Needless to say, Jacum C'Luzz and Eruvin T'Kix were not impressed,<br>eyeing me with contempt as I swam laps around the guildhouse.  By<br>the time I was five years of age, I had explored every nook and<br>cranny of that ancient underground city, from the houses of the<br>powerful to the back alleys where true power was wielded more<br>freely, and the hidden places of the rogues that even they thought<br>safe from all other prying eyes.  It was a life of wandering, and<br>of unsurety.  More to the point, it was a life without any true<br>purpose.  The guilds would have nothing to do with me, my parents<br>were dead or simply gone, and I had no one and nowhere to turn to.<br><br>     It was around the same time that a human warrior named Zeruel<br>Tenken took a young Tier'dal warrior under his wing and began his<br>training.  This human knew that his time in the world was short,<br>but could not bear for his martial skills to die with him, so he<br>took a relatively unformed boy from the Nektulos forests in and<br>trained him in the ways of war.  Soon after, the master died, and<br>the boy began to make his own way in the world.  He took the name<br>of his shisho, or master teacher, and became something of a legend<br>amongst the Tier'dal, if also something of an outcast.  Children<br>waited breathlessly to hear of his exploits, and adults were by<br>turn impressed with his skill, and afraid that he must hate his<br>race and be seeking power to take vengeance.<br><br>     I, on the other hand, was not terribly impressed with him.<br>He was base, of common height, and absolutely nothing about him<br>stood out at first glance.  He visited the city sometimes, if<br>irregularly, walking through as though waiting to be pounced upon<br>and be forced to fight for his life.  What brought him to be this<br>way, I do not know... and it would not be my story to tell even if<br>I did.  He was, perhaps, the most free that a Tier'dal has ever<br>been, and, looking back on that time, I hated him for it.<br><br>     He found me one day, two years later, staring into the<br>lake that settled around the Commons.  "I've been looking for<br>you," he spoke softly, hardly more than whispering.  Why anyone<br>would be looking for me at all intrigued me, so I turned my head<br>to the left and eyed him from the side of my vision.  If anything,<br>he only looked more harsh and severe than he had before.  "You are<br>very much our father's daughter, Tokio-san.  Zeruel Tenken gave me<br>a chance when no one else would.  I am here to offer you a similar opportunity."<br><br>     Needless to say, I was shocked.  Yes, very surely that.  I<br>refused to let it show on my face, though, that or anything else,<br>for fear that my hatred of him and my jealousy of his freedom<br>would shine through my eyes as clearly as day.<br><br>     "Is there a doll's soul behind that doll's face?" he asked,<br>just as softly as before.  There was no movement to his stance,<br>so that he seemed almost one with the ground at his feet, and<br>that his body had grown up out of it.  It reminded me somehow of<br>the few dwarves that I had seen taken to the chambers of the<br>necromancers, and I could not help being wryly amused at the<br>thought.<br><br>     I stood up, turned around, and glared at him.  If there has<br>ever been such a thing as an emerald with the hardness of a<br>diamond, it was my eyes at that very moment.  This 'great warrior'<br>and I were -not- getting off to the most cordial of starts.  The<br>fact that he had fairly forsaken a people who had forsaken me<br>did not raise his standing in my mind.  If he could forswear the<br>blood of his race, could he not just as easily forswear the blood<br>of one he called sibling?<br><br>     "Chinsei, onee-chan..." Zeruel said, still not raising his<br>voice.  It was a placating tone, though.  It didn't fit with the<br>stories of him, or the look of him, but it had a pleasing sound.<br>This was the sound of a voice restrained in all things, and a<br>window to the soul of a man.  And I was far, far too young to<br>understand.<br><br>     "Little sister, hmm?  Don't we have a mighty opinion of<br>ourselves..."  It wasn't necessarily that I didn't believe him,<br>but I didn't like the familiarity that he spoke with.  If there<br>was anything that I thought I knew at that time in my life, it<br>was that this warrior needed to be condescended to, certainly<br>not reasoned with or agreed with.  The anger was wasted, however.<br><br>     "Hush.  And don't think for a second that I can't or won't<br>snap you in half.  I don't give a damn about this race's ideas<br>of female superiority, and I've seen more than enough to know<br>that the majority of it is a complete cartload of ogre droppings."<br>For some reason, he was smiling by the end of his short tirade.<br>Whether from the look on my face, or for some other reason, I<br>never learned.  Still, he continued, "I suppose, if you really<br>-want- to be as ignorant as the rest of the fools who spend most<br>of their lives hiding in a hole in the ground..."<br><br>     I know, looking back on it, that I deserved to be talked to<br>that way... needed to be, most likely... In either event, it did<br>get my attention.  I dropped my gaze to the floor like the<br>scolded child I was before he finished speaking.<br><br>     "Oh, so you do know how to show a little respect, if someone<br>proves they deserve it.  If you can strike a good balance, that<br>should serve you well."  He shrugged.  "So, what do you want to<br>be?  I could probably turn you into a respectable warrior, but<br>somehow I don't think it would fit.  I'll sponsor you wherever<br>you choose, though.  They'll listen to me, and accept it...<br>whether or not they like it."  He smirked knowingly - he knew<br>what kind of a hold a legend and fear had over the people of the<br>City of Eternal Night.<br><br>     "Mahoutsukai."<br><br>     He sighed audibly, as if at an old regret.  "So which is it,<br>magician or wizard?"<br><br>     I realized my error almost immediately... simple vagueness.<br>Mahoutsukai would translate as either of those professions.<br>Then again, in a way, it didn't matter.  Either way, I was not<br>likely to progress far.  Sponsorship or not, I was only one who<br>could be taught a magical trade, and most likely not much.<br>Still, it was a better alternative than the faceless days I had<br>known.  "Wherever I choose, hmm?  Magician, hon.  I will be a<br>magician."<br><br>     I don't know how that turn of phrase found its way onto my<br>tongue that day, but I expect it's familiar to anyone who would<br>be reading this.  The first person I ever called hon was my<br>half-brother.  Is that truly surprising?  Well, maybe.<br><br>     We went straight away to the Tower of the Spurned where,<br>suspiciously, we were admitted without comment or challenge.<br>Zer lead me to the basement, and into the middle of a ritual<br>being conducted by Jayna D'Bious.  Nothing exploded, no rogue<br>elementals arose from their planes, so I can only assume that<br>whatever the experiment was, an interruption was less than<br>able to set it awry.  Still, Janya glared so cruelly at the<br>man who had interrupted her ceremony that I expected him to<br>burst into flames at any moment.<br><br>     "I have something for you," Zeruel said dryly.  "It may<br>show the potential to become a magician, but that's not<br>something I can divine.  It has everything it needs at its'<br>disposal, as far as a simple warrior can tell."  He grinned<br>evilly enough to chill a necromancer to the bone.  "If you<br>don't want it, of course, I understand that the rogues are<br>always interested in younglings with dexterous and steady<br>hands for their craft."<br><br>     Though I didn't know it at the time, if there is one thing<br>in the world that Jayna hates above all others, it -has- to be<br>the rogue guild.  Needless to say, at that point she was all<br>too happy to take on a new initiate.  I'm not sure when the<br>Tenken slipped away... though I doubt he stayed any longer than<br>strictly necessary.  That very day, I swore myself to the<br>novitiate of magicians, and forswore in my heart the worship of<br>Innoruuk that it seemed to me poisoned this race of mine.<br><br>     I spent the next several years at the feet of the masters,<br>learning the skills of the Arch Magi.  To say that I lived in<br>the Tower of the Spurned would be to understate the case.  I<br>lived and breathed the magic, from the earliest days of my<br>initiation.  Even in those days, when I was not in the Tower, I<br>was either wishing I was there, going from there on an errand,<br>or returning there from an errand.  I spent some little time<br>killing the vermin that infested the Forest of Eternal Night, but<br>these times were all cold business, a necessary evil distracting<br>me from my studies of things arcane and powerful.  For three<br>years I grew quickly in mind, but slowly in body, so that at the<br>age of ten, I looked not much older than I had at five, except<br>to anyone who would look at my eyes.  In those first days, they<br>had been dull and bored, lightless and lifeless.  This was the<br>very least of the things that changed while I was under the<br>instruction of one of the greatest and cruelest Tier'dal.<br><br>     Mages were likely the most popular of the Spurned,<br>especially while still new to their learning and power, and I<br>was mobbed on almost every trip out of the tower, for use in<br>anything from summoning knives (didn't they have their own<br>utensils?), to lighting small fires (ask a wizard, PLEASE, or<br>even an enchanter - their fires last over time), to the<br>inevitable younglings that think that anything beautiful and<br>powerful can be theirs.  Occasionally, the wrong people would<br>get what the wrong people asked for - fires under the people<br>begging for knives, stolen kisses from the people wanting a burn<br>spell, and summoned knives in the overly zealous.  It was almost<br>a shame when they all finally realized that I had no interest in<br>playing by their simple rules and either gave up in despair<br>or fled in terror.  Not that I ever hurt anyone -too-<br>seriously, but I did occasionally get notes from the cleric<br>guild thanking me for an added source of income.  I outgrew<br>that period of my life eventually, though the simple mention<br>of my ability to summon sharp objects is even now cause for<br>some men to go running for the hills and hidden places of the<br>world, whether or not they were being overly friendly.<br><br>     Outside of the Tower, I think the only man I held any<br>serious respect for was the Tenken.  Over time, I suppose I<br>accepted the fact that he was my onii-san.  It still bothered<br>me from time to time, but that was simply a product of the<br>environment I was raised in, seeing men as inferiors, though<br>I still take it to extremes in some cases.  Still, I do<br>believe I could have turned out worse, with someone like<br>D'Bious for a sensei.  My learning increased apace, exceeding<br>the expectations of my instructors.  I was driven, in the<br>end, by the idea that the more I succeeded, the more of an<br>insult I was to that damnable Xon Quexill.  My continued<br>existance was not enough - I had to excel.  Excellence was<br>not enough - I had to make sure it was -known- that I<br>excelled, known that I was far beyond what the people who<br>had ordered me conceived had ever expected.<br><br>     In these days, I had very few friends, and just as few<br>contacts with the world outside of my guild.  Of those others<br>who were near to my level of skill in the arts of magic, all<br>are now dead or passed on.  I can lament the passing of some<br>of those whom I might have called sister, but the truth is<br>that some were too weak, and some were too sure of their<br>power, and even a few had downfalls contrived by myself.<br>All of this lasted for years of my training, and Mistress<br>D'Bious nodded approvingly all the while.<br><br>     Maturing physically could best be described as the worst<br>time during my entire novitiate.  Between the actual changing<br>of myself, and the loss of useful sleep, saying that my studies<br>suffered would be putting the matter in an almost positive<br>light.  The one thing that I did learn near the beginning of<br>this time was that my teacher was not all-knowing.  For whatever<br>reason, she could not understand the fact that I did not -want-<br>to change, and knew no reason that it should be any other way.<br>I was unlucky, I suppose, in that I held onto my first form for<br>so long that it was terribly distracting to my ability.  The<br>robes of an initiate were enough to keep me from exploring and<br>moving freely as I did in my younger days, but this...  In the<br>end, the trouble that arose of people's obsession with me any<br>time I left the Tower finally resulted in teaching myself how<br>to cast flame auras, what some call "damage shields', about<br>myself to keep people away from my person.  Jayna also failed<br>to understand why I did not desire this attention, and though<br>I heard many glowing words about my ability to learn and use<br>magic, I cursed her silently.  This was, of course, only the<br>beginning of my trials, but it came late, as I said, in the<br>twentieth year of my novitiate.<br><br>     From that time on, moments of peace were rare indeed.<br>Finally growing into adulthood, and with it, new power, I was<br>expected to start finding ways to spend as little time on my<br>studies as possible.  Most of my then-friends had already<br>fallen behind in ability, regardless of the fact that their<br>power had matured earlier in them, because they made what had<br>become, as far as our instructors were concerned, a normal<br>mistake in finding more adult interests than the practicing of<br>magic.  So, of course, everyone expected me to walk happily<br>down the same path and split my life in half.  Because of this,<br>the arch magicians of the tower were puzzled when the rest of<br>the students continued to fall further behind.  To my great<br>amusement, the lot of them endured one of the more famous tirades<br>ever delivered by Mistress D'Bious, on the subject of paying proper attention to their studies.  That is to say, it all went something<br>like this:  "Look at that girl.  She didn't faulter where -all- of<br>you did."  And with that, she promptly beat the entire class to<br>within an inch of their lives with a summoned elemental.  It all<br>became far less amusing, of course, when they redoubled their<br>efforts to trip me up and distract me from my studies.  For nearly<br>a year they continued with small pranks and the like, until the<br>next review by our masters.<br><br>     To my shame, I had not continued the pace with which I had<br>been outdistancing them, but the gap was still more than it was<br>in the previous year.  So, for the second time, Jayna proceeded<br>to prove to her students just how far they had to go.  And, with<br>that, their efforts to lower my standing were again doubled, to<br>the point that several of the class spent more time plotting my<br>downfall than they did with their studies and other interests<br>combined.  During this year, I learned two things.  First, that<br>they would all continue falling farther behind the more they<br>thought they were succeeding in their designs against me, and<br>second that some of those designs were amusing to fall into<br>purposefully, since thinking that they were succeeding, they<br>devoted less and less time to improving themselves.<br><br>     When I decided that I truly had had enough, I began taking<br>matters into my own hands.  After the third year of reviews,<br>the idiocy of people who were far too sure of themselves began<br>to take its toll on me, and I grew bored with the increasingly<br>outlandish and feeble attempts to disrupt what I had made into<br>my life's work.  Perhaps I overstepped my bounds slightly in<br>my choice rebuttal for them, but it also had its effectiveness<br>from the fact that no one had thought to try it yet against me.<br>After an evening of lessons in the arts of summoning, I lingered<br>around the tower for one of my few true friends, who happened to<br>be in the final stage of novitiate as an enchanter.  It is most<br>likely due to our different avenues of study that he and I did<br>not end up as near to enemies as most of my former friends in<br>my class did, and I suppose he was also the only male I ever<br>truly loved, though that came slightly later.<br><br>     What the two of us ended up working out was both simple and<br>possible.  Once every week or so, I would invite one of my<br>classmates to visit my room after the day's lessons were done.<br>I cannot think of a single one of them of either gender that did<br>not have a lascivious look on their face, though I suppose it<br>was not necessarily all the same hunger.  I would always arrive<br>late, after them, for the purpose of allowing my enchanter<br>friend time to prepare for his work.  The first night, I invited<br>a practically brainless fool named Xalil, who somehow had an<br>aptitude for summoning, if for nothing else.  This choice was as<br>purposeful as I could make it, since I didn't believe the idiot<br>would even know what ensorcellment was, much less if it were<br>applied to him incorrectly.  Needless to say, though, nothing<br>went wrong, and the next day Xalil was glowing with the tale of<br>his 'conquest'.  For my part, I tried to keep a blush on my<br>face for the whole day, so that anyone who heard the fool's<br>boasting would think it true.  Victory was all the more sweet<br>two weeks later when it finally dawned on him that I was never<br>going to ask him to come back.  He mindlessly kept pursuing,<br>but word of what he had supposedly done got back to Jayna, and<br>he was never seen again.<br><br>     That very day, I chose the next of them, a girl who shared<br>her personal name with our head instructor.  She was one of the<br>few whose plots had actually managed to accomplish their goals<br>in the past, and since I now knew that Xenil's enchantments<br>would work as they were supposed to, it was time to strike at a<br>real threat.  The plan changed quickly, however, when I returned<br>to my room and was quite thoroughly kissed as soon as I had the<br>door shut.  Unfortunately, I didn't hear Xenil laughing until<br>after I had a summoned knife in my grip and the blade in the<br>girl Jayna's stomach, angling upwards.  The laughter almost<br>immediately left my ears and time seemed to stretch out as I<br>looked into deep red eyes that seemed to grow paler as I watched.<br>None of what had truly happened entered my thoughts as I stared<br>dumbstruck, a mouth still moving against mine, though now gasping<br>for breath.  I don't know how long I stood there, mesmerized by<br>her eyes as truly as by any spell as she died before me, and<br>even as her blood stained my lips and robe I could not make<br>myself scream, or even cry.  All I knew at that moment was that<br>I had never before realized how beautiful her eyes were.<br><br>     I must have cried out eventually, or Xenil must have<br>discretely alerted an instructor that something had happened,<br>because my next memory was waking with a face covered by dried<br>tears in Mistress D'Bious' room.  How long I had been there, or<br>when I had been moved I had no recollection, and I was never<br>able to find out, for no one would speak of it afterwards.  It<br>was as if the event had been stricken from all of the Tower<br>records.<br><br>     At least two days I wasted, laying alone in a room not my<br>own, unwilling to even leave the bed to retrieve my robe from<br>the back of a nearby chair.  Food was left only while I slept,<br>though I refused to consume it waking.  In that time that I<br>call two days, I often fell asleep thinking of a pair of red<br>eyes staring into my own, and awoke startled and frightened<br>when I remembered in my dreaming why those eyes were important.<br><br>     In the end, Jayna came to me in that room and demanded<br>first that I should tell her what had occurred, and second that<br>I should return to my studies or be removed as a failure.  So I<br>told her the story of the student who bore her name, and all<br>that had happened, save only Xenil's part in the affair.  To my<br>credit, I did not once during that retelling break down in tears<br>and mournful repentance, doing just as any model Tier'dal<br>should.  As the story wound to its conclusion, though, she<br>merely arched one delicate eyebrow at me questioningly.<br><br>     "You killed her for kissing you?" she asked in a soft voice.<br>It sounded much like that which Zeruel had used with me long ago,<br>but at the same time, far more sinister.  "Child," she continued,<br>laughing softly, "if she were willing to do that, was she not<br>already within your power?  Killing her was beyond wasteful, you<br>realize."<br><br>     She could not be allowed to know that it was Xenil's fault,<br>of course.  The penalty for interfering with someone in another<br>line of study was severe, and for using actual magic on them?<br>Death, without question, immediately.  So, instead of chancing<br>an answer with words, I nodded my reply.<br><br>     Without speaking, the arch magician walked from the foot of<br>the bed over to the chair which my robe was folded across and<br>sat down, watching me all the while.  She sat there in silence<br>for a few minutes, eyes on me, and yet seemingly far away.<br><br>     "Child," Jayna said finally, "come and take back thy robe,<br>if thou canst.  Else I shall personally see thee stricken from<br>the rolls and cast out of the tower without honour."<br><br>     Everything about her, from her sudden overwhelming bearing<br>to the archaic speech marked this as a testing, and failing any<br>such was a sure and certain way to lose all chance at<br>progressing in rank.  As upset as I was over what had happened,<br>I knew I had to focus, or thirty and one years of work would<br>have been for nothing.  With that as my only motivation, I stood<br>from the bed and walked the short few steps to the chair,<br>determination masking my pain and my shame.<br><br>     Jayna stood as I reached the chair, her face masked with a<br>smile that was the only thing she ever let show on her face at a<br>student's testing.  "Shall I remember you for your eyes, or your<br>skill, or for killing one of our own?" she asked in that same<br>dangerously soft voice.<br><br>     "Will you kill everyone who touches you?" she continued,<br>slapping me across the face.  "Or only a woman who does?"  The<br>slap came from the other side and turned my face before I<br>thought to control it.<br><br>     "Is it your fear, then, that is holding you back, child?"<br>The smile still had not left her face.  It had, if anything,<br>become more amused.  "After all, who could possibly call you down<br>if you managed to slay me as you did that slip of a girl?  Not<br>that you are capable of it, of course.  Or am I going about it<br>the wrong way, trying to awaken the killer's spirit you found in<br>yourself that night?"  Jayna laughed, as cold and soft as her<br>voice had been.  Had I known better, I would have cowered in fear<br>at that point.  Still, it was a testing, so I had to endure.<br><br>     It was well-known then that the Arch Mage of the Tower had<br>no love in her.  There was only respect for those with power,<br>and contempt for those without.  Those were the only thoughts I<br>could hold to, and the only things that allowed me to make any<br>sense of the world as Jayna-shisho kissed me as the other girl<br>had while under Xenil's magics.  In my mind, I saw again what I<br>did that night, but my hand stayed slack at my side until the<br>test was done and that dear, hateful, wonderful, detestable<br>woman left the room.<br><br>     On that day, I was moved to the second stage of learning.<br>And from that day, the test was always the same:  would I stay<br>my hand, or would I try to kill my teacher as she made me relive<br>what I had done on that terrible night.  If I had ever mustered<br>the courage to look into her eyes when the testing came, I might<br>just have, and that thought still fills me with trepidation.<br><br>     Having proved that my studies were important enough to me,<br>and that I had the ability to progress, the second stage of my<br>novitiate passed in merely half the time that the first did.<br>People were far more given over to their studies and quest for<br>knowledge, and so most of my problems from the first thirty<br>years dried up within days, once the other students realized<br>that I was as serious as they were about achieving status as a<br>full magician.  On the second day, Xenil found me after the<br>end of lessons, while I was engrossed in the Tower's library<br>furthering my knowledge.  He took a book off of a nearby shelf,<br>seemingly at random, and sat down across from me without saying<br>a word.  The two of us sat there for at least an hour, and I<br>know that at least I was actually studying.  Finally, when he<br>could no longer bear the silence, he broke it.<br><br>     "Tokio, I'm..." he began, and I promptly cut him off.<br><br>     "Interrupting my studies, is what you're doing," I finished<br>curtly, never raising my eyes from the book in front of me.<br>"Now leave."<br><br>     "I'm sorry," Xenil finished, the only time I can recall<br>hearing another Tier'dal actually apologize for anything in<br>sincerity.  "I couldn't...  I just couldn't."<br><br>     At that point, I realized that this had been just as<br>difficult for him as it had been for me.  Xenil needed no one<br>to test him, to see if he tested true.  He concealed all of<br>his pain from everyone concerning that incident.  Everyone but<br>me.  Who else could he turn to, though?  It was an amazing leap<br>of faith, or an amazing show of stupidity, even to bring the<br>topic up with me.  After all, should his part ever become known<br>he would surely be put to death.  Maybe it was weak of me, but<br>then he was the only person I held anything truly in common with<br>outside of my studies, dangerous as it was to know, and for a<br>time I did love him, as much for trusting me as for anything<br>else that he did or said before or after that day.<br><br>     A few months later, the time came once again for my<br>testing, the second of this stage of instruction.  Being at a<br>different point that most other initiates of the second stage,<br>I was summoned to Mistress D'Bious' workroom in the depths of<br>the tower after the day's lessons were done for the test.  Once<br>again she kissed me, but now fire burned my lips, and it was all<br>I could do not to cry out from pain and shock.  And I was taken<br>then by a woman that I loved and hated, but who neither loved<br>nor hated me, for all she truly wanted was for me to expose who<br>it was who had ensorcelled her pupil on that night a year and a<br>half ago, because she had learned finally that there was nothing<br>that would have made the girl whose name was her own do what she<br>had done of her own free will.  And between pain, and hatred,<br>and pleasure I betrayed to her a name.  A true name.  Xenil's<br>name.  So, with a last kiss, she left me laying on the floor at<br>the end, crying from all that she had given to me and from me<br>taken away, and she went to see to the death of that man whom I<br>had loved.<br><br>     On that day, trust was taken from me, and love was taken<br>from me, and for a time I grew cold.  I hated Jayna D'Bious,<br>and I hated the Tier'dal, but most of all I hated myself, my<br>weakness, and even my ability to hate.  At that time, I poured<br>myself into my studies as molten metal into a mold, trying to<br>better myself in the only way that I could still see available<br>to me.  I progressed quickly and learned well, and as I<br>mentioned before, the second stage of my novitiate cost me only<br>fifteen years of my life.  By this time, I was capable of all<br>manner of lesser summonings, including elementals of some power,<br>and it was time for a final test, far different from what I had<br>dealt with for those years that lay behind me.  All of this<br>earned me much acclaim, but my heart was hard to it, and what I<br>saw was simply a way to strike back after a fashion against the<br>people who had ruined my heart.<br><br>     Therefore, to further my fame, I took as my test the<br>dangerous sea voyage to the continent of Faydwer to combat the<br>Fier'dal in their Lesser Faydarks and the minions of the<br>Tier'dal-turned-vampire Mayong Mistmoore.  The exploits were not<br>really remarkable, but none actually expected me to return to<br>the City of Eternal Night, so simply walking into the city<br>carrying vials of Fier'dal blood, vampire blood, and money won<br>through combat was testament enough to the fact that I had fought<br>and conquered.  Though I was not there to witness it personally,<br>I have been told by reliable sources that Xon Quexill flew into<br>a fit of rage and supposedly sacrificed the then-current<br>shadowknight guildmaster to Innoruuk.  Whether or not the latter<br>is true, none may tell, but I do find it likely.  It was and is<br>well-known that the fool of a necrophiliac would sacrifice anyone,<br>given reason.<br><br>     So great was this homecoming that there was actually a<br>procession through the city in my honour.  While the people<br>celebrated, however, I locked myself in my room near the Tower<br>with books of knowledge and gave my mind over to study.  The<br>noise outside, while loud, was tolerable, though it did not die<br>down as the night wore on.  In truth, the whole affair was more<br>one of those rare excuses the Tier'dal took to celebrate rather<br>than any true desire to commend anyone for individual<br>accomplishments.<br><br>     More and more I ventured out into the world, seeking<br>knowledge that I knew was stored in the Tower, but that I wished<br>to find on my own.  An initiate of the final stage, classes were<br>available, but few ever chose to avail themselves of them.<br>Given the chance, nearly all those who progressed so far choose<br>to take their final steps of that journey alone, no longer<br>relying on the instructors.  For some reason, those who did<br>avail themselves of those classes always seemed to doff the<br>robes of the initiate later than those who struck out on their<br>own, which is likely why most students chose the latter as<br>their course.  Testing was periodic, and much more specific in<br>the final stage.  Things such as precise magical control under<br>pressure and the fine control of summoned elementals were the<br>tests that everyone had to take, regardless of their choice of<br>specialization in the field of magic.<br><br>     Though I was well beyond my first century of life, I still<br>kept a fairly close count of the years.  Failure no longer<br>meant being stricken from the rolls, but rather it was expected<br>that a student would not be perfect for many, many years before<br>finally passing the tests through surpassing efforts of will or<br>sheer dumb luck.  To give an idea of the general timeframe for<br>the final stage of the initiate, the average age of a third<br>stage class ranged normally from sixty to over four hundred.<br>There were a few exceptions, of course.  Some, like I had been,<br>were simply fast learners and progressed to the final stage of<br>their instruction sooner than the rest of their class, and then<br>others were slower of thought or desired more of themselves than<br>even the near-perfection that the tests required and would thus<br>intentionally fail by a narrow margin to remain in the Tower,<br>not thinking themselves yet ready to be called full magicians.<br>As they tend to do, however, the years ran together without any<br>disturbing revelations and near my two-hundred and thirtiety<br>year of instruction in the arts, I finally passed from the<br>novitiate and quickly left the city that had been my home.<br><br><br>     This is by no means the end of the story of Kageriyume<br>Tokio, but the rest is too recent, or too garbled to make a good<br>accounting of the events.  Few other things are known about this<br>living Shadow over a Dream except by those close to her.  What<br>is known is that Jayna remains her only true kinslaying, and<br>that her peculiar loves and hates can nearly all be traced back<br>to the Mistress of the Tower of the Spurned, Jayna D'Bious.  Her<br>heart is somehow more at peace away from that world where she<br>grew, and can often be found meditating in mountains or near<br>trees and rivers, or other things of nature.  Dangerous when<br>crossed, desperate for trust to receive and give, and afraid of<br>it all at once.  In the end, perhaps I am the one who failed.<br><br>                    - Zeruel Tenken<br>                      an excerpt from "Lost Children of Tunare"<br><br><br><br>Translations (alphabetical)<br>Chinsei     - calm, tranquil (used here as 'calm yourself')<br>Kageriyume  - Shadowdream (literally 'shadow over a dream')<br>Mahoutsukai - wizard, magician, warlock, witch<br>Onee-chan   - younger sister<br>Onii-san    - older brother<br>Sensei      - teacher, instructor (literally 'learned person')<br>Shisho      - Master teacher (also shishou)<br>Tenken      - Heaven's Sword, or God's Speed<br>Tokio       - Componentially, To - outside; Ki - rejoice, or<br>              take pleasure in; O - superiority, or excellence;<br>              So, applied to myself, it would translate closely<br>              as "One apart, who rejoices in excellence"<br>              (Please note, there are a LOT of translations for<br>              this name, not to mention simply a lot of ways to<br>              write it in the kanji.)<br>Zeruel      - Angel of Strength (medieval angel lore) <p><img SRC="http://www.dirthurts.com/images/tokio/tokisig1.jpg" height=420 width=210></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub5.ezboard.com/fbloodcirclefrm12.showPrevMessage?topicID=19.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub5.ezboard.com/fbloodcirclefrm12.showNextMessage?topicID=19.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub5.ezboard.com/fbloodcirclefrm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=19.topic><img src=http://www.tj3systems.com/bloodcircle/forumimages/bc_addrpy.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub5.ezboard.com/fbloodcirclefrm12.threadControl?topicID=19.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub5.ezboard.com/fbloodcirclefrm12.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=19.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub5.ezboard.com/fbloodcirclefrm12.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=19.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub5.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="bloodcirclebloodcirclegeneral">Blood Circle General<option value="bloodcirclefrm9">Blood Circle Raids & Events<option value="bloodcirclebloodcirclefriends">Blood Circle Friends<option value="bloodcirclebloodcirclefoes">Blood Circle Foes<option value="bloodcirclefrm11">Blood Circle Bank and Trades<option value="bloodcirclefrm15">Member Only Access Requests<option value="bloodcirclefrm14">Membership Applications<option value="bloodcirclefrm12">Blood Circle Tales<option value="bloodcircleguildwar">Officers Discussion<option value="bloodcirclefrm6">Members Only<option value="bloodcirclefrm16">The Blood Circle Library</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub5.ezboard.com/bbloodcircle>Blood Circle</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub5.ezboard.com/fbloodcirclefrm12>Blood Circle Tales</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.bloodcircle.org/">Blood Circle Home Page</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br> <SCRIPT language='javascript' src='http://www.smartcal.com/calendar/external/1560137?eview=ExternalReminder&inlining=true'></SCRIPT><center>This Website is for private use.<BR>Employees of Verant Interactive, Sony, or any affiliated organizations or individuals are not allowed to visit this site.<BR>Any information found here may not be copied or referred to in any manner without written approval.<BR>For approval please email kannushi_nanasawa@hotmail.com.</center></body> <br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.9.5.3<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
