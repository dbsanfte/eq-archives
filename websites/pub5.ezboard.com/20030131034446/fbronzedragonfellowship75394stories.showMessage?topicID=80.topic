The man let out a deep sigh and smiled to himself, as his companion started toward a small village off in the distance.<br>
<br>
&quot;Feels good to be home, dosent it Sarir?&quot;<br>
&quot;Yes, my friend, it does.&quot;<br>
<br>
It was nearing dusk by the time they arrived in the village, not much more then a hamlet, but it was home. They had been on many long adventures together and were travel-weary and hungry. They had been on the road for weeks since their last sign of life in the Northern peaks of Everfrost where they had taken shelter with the barbarians of the north after traveling the vast expanses of the lost continents. They had faced great dangers, vanquished uncounted evils, and had some fun along the way. But now they were home.<br>
<br>
The two men shook hands and parted to go to their seperate homes, all the while getting surprised looks and greetings from the townsfolk whom thought the two long dead. But they paid little attention to the buzz around them, more concerned with a soft bed and warm food at the time. As the night drew out the two spent the first night in their own beds for the first time in over 4 years.<br>
<br>
The next morning, as the townsfolk gathered together in the commons, the two awoke and were given a welcome suited for hero's.<br>
<br>
Sarir Delonal was a strong, battlehardened Dwarf. His hair was just beginning to grey and you could see the signs of many traveled roads in his face. You couldnt ask for a more loyal friend to have at your side in a battle. A warrior of Bristlebane, his faith was unwaivering, and he had defended these lands from danger many a time.<br>
<br>
The other man, Raeu Istaris, was shrouded in mystery. Nobody knew from where he came, he just showed up one day. A small abode appeared in the outskirts of the village and he took up residence. Many bright explosions and strange creatures came forth from this place, but he never did anything to harm the town. Once, long ago, the town of  Argyndril had been attacked suddenly,  and if not for the combined strength of Raeu and Sarir, the town would have been overrun by the legions of the Undead sent by the evil Necromancer,  Kargan. Raeu and Sarir were fast friends after that ordeal. And in the end, they decided to go traveling together.<br>
<br>
Later that evening, in the meeting house, the two friends were bombarded by questions of what had happened to them for the last 4 years. Both were reluctant to answer at first but they were finally coaxed into telling of their journeys.<br>
<br>
Sarir began, &quot;So you want to here a tale do you? Well then, mabye the two of us can stir up a story or two, eh, Roau?&quot;<br>
&quot;Im sure we can find something that would spark their interest, Sar.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Long ago, the great Wurms took residence on this sphere of life, hoping to one day rule it all. But, the mother Veeshan, while being great and powerful, was offset by the new gods that had taken interest in this place, and decided to join the dragons here. They created the Giants, Barbarians, Elves, and Iksar, Ogres, Trolls, and all the rest. The world was in contention then, and it is in contention now, as it will be for all time. Now, we all know this, but it is nessicary to the story. You see, we have slain the wurms. They are no more, and the world will have new challenges with them gone!&quot;<br>
A gasp arose from the crowd.<br>
&quot;What we tell you is very true friends, but the tale is long and ardous was the path. Would you like to hear of it?&quot;<br>
A mutual agreement was murmured.<br>
&quot;Well it is too late tonight, I fear our stories would run late into tomorrow if we began now, but let us gather here at midday tomorrow and we will tell of such things.&quot;<br>
The townsfolk looked disappointed, but agreed with the two.<br>
&quot;Good Eve, friends, and be prepared for tomorrow.&quot;<br>
<br>
Sarir and Roau lingered a while longer than the rest.<br>
&quot;Do you regret what we have done Sar?&quot;<br>
&quot;For better or for worse, it is done Roau, we can only weave the tales of it now. So let it be a good one.&quot;<br>
<br>
They returned to their houses, and were soon resting blissfully.<br>
