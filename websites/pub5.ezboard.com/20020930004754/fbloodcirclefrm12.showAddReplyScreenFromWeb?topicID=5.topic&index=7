As Centuri’s eyes searched the little one’s face, her heart sank.  This one was no longer whole in spirit or mind.  Tyvlain had accomplished with this little girl what he tried to do with her.  The blank, vacant expression spoke of one who had seen too much.  This child’s spirit had been totally broken.<br>
Centuri trembled slightly as pent-up memories of fire and the sounds of screams threatened to engulf her.  But for the Mother’s grace, SHE might have been this child.<br>
<br>
An evil chuckle brought her attention back to Tyvlain.  The self-satisfied smirk on the Tier’dal Assassin’s face hit Centuri like a bucket of water from the oceans of Iceclad.  He had read every thought as it passed across her face.<br>
<br>
She ruthlessly suppressed the memories again, collecting her thoughts and schooling her expression into blank neutrality.  The dark one’s evil grin widened.<br>
Hey toyed with a small, golden dagger, twirling it idly between his fingers.  “You know what I want, young Paladin, why do you continue to waste my time by fighting? You are only delaying the inevitable.  Why don't you just give it to me?”<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  Because you’re a scum-sucking, demon-spawned, son of a sarnak and you don’t deserve to draw breath in my presence, much less demand concessions of me!</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
She remained silent.<br>
<br>
After a long moment, he sighed.  “ You truly are the most exasperating of females.  I don’t know what my brother sees in you.”<br>
He began to stroke the little girl’s hair and he drew her closer to him as he continued to speak to Centuri.<br>
“I did some research after my brother’s rather alarming display of temper.  Killing three of the Dark Masters over a couple of slaves?  Frankly, I was rather bewildered by his behavior until I found the origin of those two slaves.”<br>
Centuri fought to keep her expression blank as the memories swirled up form the depths once more.<br>
“It seems they came from a raid on a small village in the Faydark many years ago.  Now, I was already investigating the rumors of Soulshiver’s recent aberrant behavior over a certain Paladin of Tunare.  You will never guess what I discovered! You originally came from the same village as those two slaves.  Imagine my surprise!”  He laughed.<br>
Centuri seethed.  He was truly enjoying this moment, dragging it out as long as possible.<br>
“What a frightened child you must have been.”<br>
<br>
“Get to your point, Tyvlain,” she growled through clenched teeth.<br>
<br>
He frowned at her familiar address. “Very well, here it is then.  You will submit to me, obey my every order and command or this child will die right now.”  He placed the point of the thin blade under the little girl’s jaw.  Her eyes widened slightly as the comprehension of her imminent death seeped through the layers of blankness she had wrapped her broken soul in.  As Centuri met her eyes, a tiny spark of comprehension lit for just one, short moment.  Then, it was gone, smothered once more.  Centuri closed her eyes for one moment to keep the tears from dropping and steeled her heart against what she must do. If this was the worst he could do, he would fail again. <br>
She looked straight at the Dy’Truin lordling and said “No.”<br>
<br>
He shrugged, and with a small, practiced movement of his wrist, cut the little girl’s throat.  Centuri watched the light drain from her eyes as her life drained away on the floor in a crimson puddle.  Full of shock and horror that he would truly do such a callous thing, Centuri whispered a prayer to the Mother, asking that She might gather in the broken child and bring her to peace at last.<br>
Tyvlain sighed as he wiped the little blade clean on a linen napkin and stepped over the body on the floor. “Very well, we shall continue this conversation elsewhere.”  He snapped his fingers and the Orc guards were quick to hustle her off down the corridors after him.<br>
<br>

<br>
Once more in the slave pens, this time on the outside.  The tiny faces of children peered out at her.  Human, dwarf and others among the elves.  These were the pens that held the children…Her heart sank as she looked at those small faces.  Many of them still held hope in their eyes.  She knew his dastardly plan, now.  Her life was sacrosanct for the moment; he must keep her alive.  But, he could, and would, slaughter every other captive in the Halls of the Dead to get what he wanted – Her.<br>
He leaned over her shoulder and she could feel his hot breath in her ear as he spoke.<br>
“Their fates are in your hands now, my dear.  Do as I command and they may spend their lives in the mines.  Or, if you refuse me again, they will experience all the delights of the Dark Master’s research.  I have no need to be careful with their pathetic little lives so I assure you, their deaths will be quite drawn out and painful.  Moreover, my dear, YOU will watch every one of those sessions.  There will be no stopping, no halt, no mercy.  Not even if you beg at that point.  Not until this pen is empty.  Now, this is your only opportunity to save them from that fate…”<br>
<br>
A wave of pure loathing for the younger Dy’Truin son welled up and threatened to overwhelm her completely.  So powerful she could actually feel it echo down the twin-bond to her sister.  <br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Danger. That way lies danger, young Paladin…</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Choice? There was no choice.<br>
Swallowing her pride, she concentrated on the small children for whom she was making this sacrifice.  Reminding herself that self-sacrifice is a Paladin’s duty.  To protect the innocent.  But, oh! How it made her burn with anger….<br>
Slowly, she sank to her knees in front of Tyvlain Dy’Truin and looked down at the floor.  She choked out the words that she had refused to say throughout unspeakable tortures.  <br>
“Master,……how. May. I. Serve. You?”<br>
<br>
Self-loathing for her own perceived cowardice, for she could not watch those children die, amplified her growing, obsessive, hate for Soulshiver’s brother.<br>
<br>
Hate, a dangerous emotion for an elf in Innoruuk’s Halls.<br>
<br>
Deep within his fastness, Innoruuk tasted of the sweet, little elf and smiled.  This one too, would become one of his…<br>
