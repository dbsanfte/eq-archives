The vault is also taking donations of money toward a guild hall and other beneficial improvments to the clan.<br>
<br>
If you need any items or have anything to donate, contact me. Don't ask to withdraw money from the vault though, that money is strictly for guild improvment. I will be making up a list of all donations (items or coin) which will be posted on the website and updated often. If you find any errors in my accounting, please tell me.

<br>
If you do borrow an item from the vault, you are obligated to return it once you've found a better item or no longer have use for the item. It becomes guild property once its donated, and should not be sold under any circumstances.<br>
<br>
Any suggestions on how the vault should be run? Anything wrong with the way I have it set up? Anything I forgot? I'm very open to suggestions and (constructive) criticism.<br>

Thanks,<br>

My point here is not to say that its especially good, or that Siol Lear should do it like this, but just to provide a reference point.<br>
<br>
Originally, the CHP guild library was a one-man show.  I think Ranilion is the one who conceived of the idea, certainly he's the one that executed it.  Under his management, he allocated some character slots from his account for GL &quot;mules&quot;.  When convenient, he'd switch characters to the appropriate mule so that he could take donations or provide equipment.  The Guild Library mules resided at the North Freeport bank, and never strayed far from there.  If necessary, he'd run the mule out to the gates to meet someone.  He had a website at which he posted the list of equipment and who had borrowed it if it was not available.  He had several mules, each devoted to holding certain types of items.<br>
<br>
Later, we got a bit more sophisticated.  Most importantly, one of our members bought a separate account to hold the GL mules.  We had a couple of folks with access to the account, generally people with duel computers/connections so that they need not log off their primary character to do GL business.  Having multiple Librarians certainly helped to increase access while taking the burden off, as did having a separate account.<br>
<br>
We found that the most important items to hold were spell research components, and pre-made spells.  Once Velious came out, quest gems were also important.  The bulk of the storage of course was equipment. Generally it was newbie equipment.  So, folks who were up to their 20's could do pretty well from the GL, or their twinks.  Higher-level folks would be going for the spells and quest gems.  The CHP GL had a little bit of money, but it was not really a money bank and so we never generated a lot of cash.  And we didn't donate cash to the GL.  The only real incentive in EQ for a cash fund is for coffins.<br>
<br>
The next level of organization would be the &quot;Jiggystuff&quot; model where a central management team buys and sells high-end items on the trade market for the entire guild.  That's a great thing if you got folks who want to do it, but CHP never had folks who were into trading on that scale, so we never even started down that road.<br>
<br>
Now some observations related to DAoC and lessons learned.<br>
<br>
There are only 4 character slots on an account, so having a separate account for the GL might be hard to avoid.  Likewise, space is limited, with only roughly 90 slots per character (bank space, inventory space, and the equipment slots for what the character actually holds).<br>
<br>
Turnover of equipment is pretty high in DAoC, especially at lower levels.  As its likely that the equipment being handled by the GL will be lower level, that seems to imply a lot of desire to access the GL by lower-level characters.<br>
<br>
I have two important pieces of advice to give:<br>
<br>
(1) Don't obsess over the value of equipment.  This stuff is going to mostly be low level.  People are more important than equipment.  Yes, if somebody abuses the GL, that's an indication that they are a bad person. But be careful not to get in an argument unnecessarily about *things* because its *people* that matter.  Probably the less attention you pay to whom gave what to whom and for how long, the lower everyone's blood pressure is going to be.<br>
<br>
(2) KISS: Keep it Simple, Stupid!  The CHP GL ended up in hard times, which its just recovering from.  The reason is that someone got the idea to make a fancy database interface for the GL, which involved tracking a lot of information.  This happened at the same time as we changed GL personnel.  I'm not clear on the details, but somewhere between the implementation not being complete, and the GL head librarian not doing a transistion that involved a lot of data entry, the GL closed its doors for an extended period of time. I sincerely wish that we'd stuck with the original, clunky webpages and kept the library open, even though the intended update would have been better if it had ever gotten completed. Having people get what they need is far more important than tracking a lot of data.  So, whatever data management process you adopt, its vital that it be really, really easy for the librarians to use.  Something fancy is grand, but its much better to use a rudimentary system that gets the job done than it is to hold up getting started while a fancy system gets into place.<br>

<br>
I, for one, don't care if me name be put on a roster of donations.  I be level 10 currently, and tha equipment I have be not of high-level quality.  Me personal concern merely be that those who are in need of equipment have access ta things, and tha they return them when they upgrade.  I be sure that all o' us will be honest in returnin' items when we be done with them.<br>
<br>
Also, over time, tha items in question will be worn out by time and battle, and will probably be replaced by new people comin' into tha Clan, or new characters made by current members.  I agree to keep it simple.  Daran be quite honorable for undertaking this task, but let's leave tha man some time to enjoy the companionship of his mates and not turn him into a harried clerk tryin' ta keep up with tha lists and donors. <p>Kvinnehok <BR>

<br>
I'd be happy to give my old quested items to the vault once I outgrow them.  I'd even happily give player crafted items to the vault when they lose effectiveness for me.  But I do think it a good idea to leave store bought items out of the vault as they are of a lesser wuality and would only become a drain on guild funds.<br>
<br>
On that note, I have some bear-hide boots and a sveabone hilt sword for the vault right now.<br>

I'm not sure I should meddle in the affairs of the guilds as merely an applicant.<br>
Hrm... Not being sure never stops he though.<br>
<br>
Yesterday, I met up with Gnab. I had noticed he was in Jordheim for an extended period, and assumed he was doing trades. I quickly found out he's an armourer, and I asked if he was willing to craft me some armor.<br>
In the end, he proposed to sell me his &quot;old&quot; set of enchanted armour at a &quot;good price&quot;. He asked 5gp, and generous (and naive) as I am, I offered him 6 (all I had), since trades are important, and I figured that once my equipment was up to par I didn't need money for some time... hrm.<br>
Later, I found out Gnab could have made 10gp simply by selling his equipment to a vendor. Made me feel somewhat guilty about my &quot;generosity&quot;, when it turned out I somewhat robbed him.<br>
I also noticed that, until now, the armor hasn't become less efficient. Maybe because of the enchantment, maybe because I was lucky. *shrug* Fact is, after I'm &quot;done&quot; with it, I'm sure there's still somebody in the guild who could put it to good use.<br>
<br>
I've noticed that in Midgard, armor and weapons are replaced fairly often (ooc Contrary to Norrath, where a certain enchanter wore his Oracle Robe all the way to 56 without a real impact on his performance). This high turnover rate has a serious effect on the available amount of money we have.<br>
<br>
Therefor i wonder if it would be a good idea to set up a system where things are handed down (for a price) instead of sold back to vendors. I'm not sure on how such a system should work, I'll leave that to smarter people... hrm.<br>
Fact is, the armor I got from Gnab has helped me tremendously, and in a few days, a week at most, I can help another member of Siol Lear the way it helped me. Therefor, I shall consider the 6gp I payed, a rent, and not a purchase. And if Gnab can rent this suit to one or two more people, he might actually make a profit, allowing him to make even better armour in the future.<br>
<br>
hrm... Once again, a chaotic collection of thoughts, despite my attempts to make them as clear as possible. It's the way my Troll brain works I'm afraid.<br>
<br>
Kind regards,<br>
