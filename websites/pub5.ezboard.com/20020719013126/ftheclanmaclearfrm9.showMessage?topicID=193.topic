<br>
It has been recommend to me that a new rank structure should be put in place based at least partly on realm points, thus the proposed ranks and requirement as listed below.<br>
<br>
Note that although rank 3 is listed as Battle Commander, any member of the High Council or a Steward or the Chief can be a Battle Commander. The rank of Jarlar is for one who does not wish to participate in the civil governance of the Siol but has been designated as a leader in war. Likewise, when the commander has been selected by the Chief or highest ranking member of the Siol present, ALL, including the Chief will follow his or her lead and commands until that campaign is completed or he or she is replaced by proper authority!<br>
<br>
0 = Chief  - Laird of the Siol<br>
     everything enabled<br>
1 = Steward - Authorized to act in the name of the Laird<br>
     everything enabled <br>
2 = High Council - Advisors to the Chief and Laird, authorized to act on his orders<br>
     evrything enabled<br>
3 = Jarlar - Battle Commanders<br>
     Alliance and Officer speak enabled<br>
4 = Hersar - 20,000+ realm points<br>
5 = Boenor - 10,000+ realm points<br>
6 = Holdar - 5,000+ realm points<br>
7 = Praelar - 1,000+ realm points<br>
8 = Kin - One proven to be worthy of membership in the family of Lear across all worlds and lands. Nominated by at least two who are already Kin and attested to by an officer of the Siol (Jarlar and above). All ranks above kin are by definition, Kin. Thus, one who joins us with many realm points and is authorized Kinship may immediately rise to a higher rank. <br>
9 = Applicant - One who has requested to join the Siol and is on probation until he or she has proven worthy of the name.<br>
<br>
I recognize we have dropped the concept of Lad/Lass, but it seems to have outlived its usefullness at this point. If one is above applicant, one can wear the sigil at the 20th season and represents us to the world. If one is worthy to bear the name and sigil he or she should be worthy to be one of us.<br>

<br>
I think that the use of Realm Points to confer honors is a valid criteria in this game, as the game engine itself does that. However, I do think that there are other needs of the guild, such as recruitment and advancement, that this model does not make easier. If an applicant was to ask me right now how does one become Kin, I would be hard pressed to answer - other then to tell them to ask Legar, as he is one of the few members I remember to be an Officer with that ability. The thing is - most new folks will not want to ask - as they dont want to feel they are 'making waves' when everyone is either on the Frontier - or in Spindelhalla. My suggestion would be to have an Officer Class above Kin that is more focused on the needs of the ranks below them?<br>
<br>
It does not even have to be a 24/7 function, in fact - heeh we are all so busy playing the game that someone would have to be crazy to want to drop what they are doing to go Guild someone, or promote them - nor should it be expected of them. But, if we did set up one day every 2 weeks for these needs to be addressed - we'd be in a lot better shape as far as having clarity about both recruitment and advancement <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I personally love the RP attainable ranks - I just would make it 3 instead of the 5. But, i am confused though if we do get someone in the guild that already has a gazillion RP - is he then automatically Kin?<br>
<br>
sorry for so many Q's... just thought was a good place to ask.<br>

We are a family, and until one is deemed worthy of the name Siol Lear, a sort of probation period is required. This isn't meant to look down on someone, but to give them and us both time to see if the fit is there. Perhaps applicant is not the best sounding word, but it means exactly what it says. <br>
<br>
The answer to the Kin question is right there in Loden's post. To become Kin one needs the recommendation of two folks that are kin already or someone of High Council status or above to approve. <br>
<br>
I can't always drop what I'm doing and run somewhere to promote someone to Kin, but I've tried to do my best. I normally speak to the person and work out a time or place that we can meet. I wholeheartedly agree we should have more meetings and this being one of the big reasons. I agree that folks are reluctant to ask when they're ok'd to become Kin. It's awkward I think. A meeting every two to three weeks would help eliminate officers from running around (although I think this should go with the territory of being an officer. It is our job to get out and meet the new folk more than it is thier job to come to us.) and it would also allow the newer people to meet the others in the guild. If Loden cannot hold meetings like this due to personal time constraints, perhaps I can do it for him and get the newer folk together with others that are online, with the major guild meetings being conducted by Loden. Think this a good idea??<br>
<br>
As for the last question...In my opinion (it's ultimately up to Loden) noone starts off automatically as Kin. See my first paragraph for the reasons why. The only exceptions that I've seen made are for the folks from EQ that were already a part of MacLear. Either as a member of Clan MacLear or the great ally Crusaders of the High Plains. <br>
<br>
If anyone has questions on who in Siol Lear is an officer, go to the roster page. The Stewards and High Council members are listed there. <br>
<br>
Hope this clears some things up. I've kinda dropped the ball a bit on getting out there and meeting the newer folks, will try to pick that up a bit from now on. <br>

Of course, i am new to the guild, so I haven't been present for really the &quot;old way&quot; of doing things. The proposed changes seem fair, and reward those who are interested in RvR. It also sets a bar to strive for.<br>
<br>
I agree with the changes as well to the removal of the Lad/Lass rank. I cant speak for anyone else, but i did think it was a little confusing. Personally, i wouldn't consider joining a guild unless I knew and had grouped with its members. I knew well more than 2 members before I talked to Loden. I think removing Lad/Lass helps to streamline the process of admitting new members, so I am very happy to see that.<br>
<br>
I strongly feel that an applicant should group with the guild well before they are given the guild tag, and have at least 2 people vouch for them. Again, this is only my opinion.<br>

Much more refined than than the current structure. Yes, getting rid of the Lad/Lass rank is a great idea. I think going from Applicant to Kin makes more sense. Plus, if you want to wear the guild emblem, there is already criteria (level 20 or craft skill of 400) set forth in the game. With the current structure, you had to be promoted to Kin or higher to wear the emblem.<br>
<br>
Basing the new structure on realm points is a great idea. For those of us who have chosen to emphasize crafting rather than RvR, I think we will be happy to be at the Kin rank until we gain enough seasons to participate in RvR.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#676767><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub5.ezboard.com/uyeaverily.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Yea Verily</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lad/Lass</span><br>  Posts: 79<br> <font color=#F2CF7E>(12/27/01 11:41:31 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub5.ezboard.com/ftheclanmaclearfrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=193.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: raises a few questions</span><hr size=1> I like the new ranking system, although I would like a translation of the rank names, since I'm assuming they mean something warlike.

i also like the Ranking system,but have a question as to to levels.  They seem rather close to me. I am wondering how they aline with the levels in the Game. Is 20,000 RP = 9th level in the game. I do not know but I will start tring to find out. Just seems to me to be a bit close.<br>

As has been pointed out, folks are often slow about asking for promotion out of &quot;applicant&quot;.  I think in large part its because the process for advancing beyond that rank has not been made clear.  We should post a good description of what is needed both off the home page, and again directly on the application form.  Getting rid of lad/lass rank might help to clear the confusion.  While I don't mind the concept of a rank in between applicant and kin, the fact that the current lad/lass can't wear the emblem makes it in my opinion a bad idea, so I'm just as happy to see it go.<br>
<br>
Having meetings every 2-3 weeks might or might not work.  We can try it and see. I suspect people will get &quot;meeting'ed out&quot; after the 2nd one. More importantly, though, I think needing to wait for a guild meeting to be promoted would tend to slow things down, which is bad.  Yes, the meetings can provide an opportunity of last resort if you can't catch an officer earlier, but we can often get to people within a day or two at most -- and typically we've been getting them the same day --once we are alerted to the fact that someone needs to be promoted.  In practice its been learning of the need that takes the time, not doing the deed.  Especially if the candidate is willing to travel to an officer.<br>
<br>
As for the actual proposal, here are a few issues to consider.<br>
<br>
* The majority of guild members would need to be re-ranked. In particular, most folks who are Kin, Noble, Black Watch, or Captain of the Black Watch would need to be re-ranked by hand.<br>
<br>
* I think the names are a bad idea.  The names should be ones that have some intrinsic meaning to most of the members of the guild, not something understood by only a few people.<br>
<br>
* There's more RvR ranks proposed here than we really need, and the point values don't fit well with the game. I agree that 1000 points is a good starting point since it requires a little, but not a lot, of effort. The game gives Rank 2 at 7200 points, which is not that much different than the value of 5000 in the proposal. In game terms, RvR Rank 3 is at 62,500 points (I think). If we used that for our ranking, it certainly would indicate quite a step up in effort, which makes it a meaningful distinction. With the current breakpoints at 1K, 5K, 10K, and 20K, there's not that much difference of effort between the 2nd and 3rd, and even less (in actual practice even if the absolute number appears on the suface to be great) between the 3rd and 4th. Once you have the hang of RvR to the extent that you can get 5K points, going up to 20K isn't that big a hurdle -- which is why Mythic set the marks where they did. Relating guild ranks to the game ranks for the 2nd and 3rd levels also has the advantage of being confirmable once Mythic implements titles.<br>
<br>
Based on these observations, I suggest that we have an RvR rank at 1000 points, another at the game's R2 value (7200 points) and a third at the games R3 value (I think 62,500 points).  If you really think we need 4 RvR ranks, then insert one between 7200 and 62,500, perhaps at 30,000.  That will be a much more in tune with the true amount of effort required to get from one step to the next, and give more staying power if we plan to be playing this game for more than a month or two yet.<br>
<br>
* The proposal only addresses the issue of ranks.  There's been a lot of discussion about battle groups but not so much done, and a lot of confusion about what &quot;Black Watch&quot; is supposed to mean.  We should deal with both the issue of ranks and the issue of battle groups at the same time.<br>
<br>
Does this proposal mean that we are doing away completely with the Black Watch?  I understand that Legar is creating a new battle group.  Some of us have tentatively formed a battle group named the Jomsvikings.  But we didn't say much about it and let it hang because it wasn't clear what the guild wanted to do with battle group organization.  Does this proposal mean that we should be moving ahead on this?<br>

I think that a trade-skill person who has reached the appropriate level and who participates in RvR by making seigecraft should get promoted to the RvR ranks in some way parallel to obtaining realm points.  For example:<br>
<br>
After the first time you actively participate in creating a siege craft item used in a keep raid you get the first RvR rank.<br>
<br>
After some other objective mark has been reached (maybe 3 sieges with at least one successful, plus at least one significant door repair) you reach the 2nd RvR rank.<br>
<br>
And so on.<br>

<br>
Not only that, but it would be sort of silly to pick up siegecrafting as an armorcrafter or leathercrafter, since siege is capped at 40% of main skill, so the current best you could get is around 350 siege, and the best (after the level 40-49 materials) ever would be around 460 seige, where an weaponscrafter or fletcher could do almost double that.<br>
<br>
Any guild supporting a siegecrafter would be silly to use an armor or leathercrafter. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#676767><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub5.ezboard.com/ulodenmaclear.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Loden MacLear</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Chief of Siol Lear</span><br>  Posts: 146<br> <font color=#F2CF7E>(12/27/01 11:32:15 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub5.ezboard.com/ftheclanmaclearfrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=193.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Proposed Changes in Rank Structure and Meeting of the Si</span><hr size=1> I hear you. Now that I think about it, the RvR ranking system in-game provides a clear way to set up the guild ranks. It even has names although I have no idea what they are. If someone will give me the names that characters get at levels one, two, and three I will be glad to change the names to those. I agree that 1000, 7200 and 62500 would be good rank levels.<br>
<br>
-Now that we have the guild ranks earned by RvR down to three, what do we do with the other rank? Do we want to insert one at 30000?<br>
<br>
-By the way, the ranks I set up were taken from Norse class ranking in the time of the Vikings. The Jarlar was a battle chieftain, Hersar was a sub-Chief, Boenor was a master over a area of land, Holdar was a holder of land and a Praelar was a person who was eligible for holding land.<br>
<br>
-I think it would be good to have a monthly meeting. I am open to any specific time, but probably something like the first Sunday evening of a month at a specific time and place would be good... Comments?<br>
<br>
-As to promotion to Kin... I think, given the busyness of our schedules and gaming time, it would be good for those wanting to be kin to request a promotion. I know that is a bit of a pain, but keeping up with who is what is a massive task as there is no way I can call up a name and know the owners rank! I would LOVE to have that ability in-game and have asked for it in apppeal, but as they have not done it, I suppose I am the only one doing so to date. If the person wishing to be promoted would contact one of the senior officers and let us know who they have been with recently so we can request endorsement it would be helpful. I, for one, dont mind a few tells as long as the teller can wait until I dispatch or am dispatched by what or whomever I am fighting! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4F4F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub5.ezboard.com/ulegarmaclear.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Legar MacLear</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lad/Lass</span><br>  Posts: 6<br> <font color=#F2CF7E>(12/28/01 11:34:11 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub5.ezboard.com/ftheclanmaclearfrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=193.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Proposed Changes in Rank Structure and Meeting of the Si</span><hr size=1> &quot;* I think the names are a bad idea. The names should be ones that have some intrinsic meaning to most of the members of the guild, not something understood by only a few people.&quot;<br>
<br>
Loden explained the meaning to the names of the ranks in his suggestion. Good enough for me, I like the names and appreciate Loden taking the time to look them up. <br>
<br>
&quot;* The proposal only addresses the issue of ranks. There's been a lot of discussion about battle groups but not so much done, and a lot of confusion about what &quot;Black Watch&quot; is supposed to mean. We should deal with both the issue of ranks and the issue of battle groups at the same time.<br>
<br>
Does this proposal mean that we are doing away completely with the Black Watch? I understand that Legar is creating a new battle group. Some of us have tentatively formed a battle group named the Jomsvikings. But we didn't say much about it and let it hang because it wasn't clear what the guild wanted to do with battle group organization. Does this proposal mean that we should be moving ahead on this?&quot;<br>
<br>
The Black Watch was formed as the bodyguard to our Laird and Chief in lands long lost. It was carried forward to Midgard and a select few were chosen by the Captain. It was asked by Torveig for it not to be a guild rank, that it just be a team. Now that Torveig does not have time to lead a team around, there is no longer a Black Watch. I have contacted 15 folks about starting our own team. (just hadn't made that public yet, thanks Gisli <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ) I'm in hopes that Gisli and others form teams as well. I plan on practicing RvR with the team I've made, and working hand in hand with any other groups formed. There will be no rank given to the teams in the guild structure. It's not needed.<br>
<br>
Nothing is final here folks, the headline to this thread reads PROPOSED. The numbers separating the ranks were just used as an example, not knowing what the in game ones were. <br>
<br>
As far as tradeskills go....This proposed rank system is based on the majority of folks wishing some recognition for RvR accomplishments. The proposed RvR ranks are totally separate from the guild governing ranks. If someone is the highest rank on the RvR ladder, he's still Kin. If someone is sitting in front of the forge with a skill in the 800's, he's still Kin. We're family, not one single brother or sister is more important than another. That's how I view it anyway. <br>

<br>
Though these names at first were a bit unintuitive to me too, seeing what they do indeed mean actually makes me feel 'stoked' to use them! Tapadh leigh, Laird Loden, ye 'ave captured the heart of this Mitgaard defender. <br>
<br>
I actually see that the top 3 as the actual Guild Ranks. The bottom 3 - From being eligible to hold, to being recognized as a holder of land, to being a master of an area of land, are three very viable ranks of our RvR active Kin - but do not neccesarily have to be Ingame Guild rankings... At the moment, ranks are not visible, once they are then whether someone is tier 4 kin or not will need to be worked out. <br>
<br>
For now - a web based ranking would actually serve the Reward and Recognition better then the ingame set up [as all 4 kins slots do not really have any different permissions unless I am wrong?] RvR groups will need their OWN internal ranking structures, which at the moment may be better kept web-based?<br>
<br>
Perhaps Praeler to Boenor should then be Guild Site based definitions and rewards of our RvR active Kin is what I am saying <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  They have the same abilities and permissions, and ye may wish to reserve Rank slots for other folks that need the different chat-channels ranking set up confers [especially once alliance agendas become paramount] - if ye were to make any particular RP number conducive to attaining an ingame Ranking, as Torg pointed out getting 5000 after 1000 is not such a leap - so why not just make getting 5000 the point when ye attain this recognition of being Praelar [or Defender which encompasses Praeler to Boenor]. Just an idea <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Siol Lear itself should be seen more as a High Court for the sub-groups - to which the sub-groups pledge fealty. Siol Lear empowers them by conferring the channels of communication needed to empower the Leaders, and those that rally under the different banners. In exchange.. the Realm Points reflect collectively under the Mother Guild of Siol Lear, bringing her to Glory.<br>
<br>
In all - I think that our rank definitions will continue to grow as our own agendas change, the game is evolving, so I am happy to see our own ranks adapting with the tide. In times to come - we may see some folks get together just to make a band of ShadowBlades for deep frontier activities.. initiatives such as these may come and go.. possibly may actually figure out a way to have 'temporary folks fighting under siol lears banner' to rack up more RP a minute then a family set up allows.. lol - i am not advocating this, am just saying that agendas do change as the game does.. so changes like I am seeing proposed here really do give me confidence in the future of our Guild.<br>

I think that a meeting once a month is a grand idea and if you keep them short and sweet no one should be bored by them and it is a good way to adventure out afterwards. As in RL people will tend to gravitate to certain others all the time which is how we form bonds, however this also will tend to leave others out of the circles. I understand that this game really dose not go well with people of lower levels grouping with those of higher but I think this is mainly for fighting the game characters and not for RVR, correct me if I am wrong. My point is the newer people will most likely get stuck having to group with others outside of the Siol if there are already formed groups. The best way to learn RVR is with people who already know the ins and outs of it and most people would feel more comfortable doing this inside of the family. I am not saying this is or would happen but I can see the begging of this starting to form. Just my two cents worth take as much of it as you want. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#676767><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub5.ezboard.com/ulegarmaclear.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Legar MacLear</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lad/Lass</span><br>  Posts: 8<br> <font color=#F2CF7E>(12/28/01 3:47:33 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub5.ezboard.com/ftheclanmaclearfrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=193.topic&index=20>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Proposed Changes in Rank Structure and Meeting of the Si</span><hr size=1> Jenguss, I'm not forming a group of Lears to make a clique. When there are guild functions, we will not be in our groups, we will be with our entire family. Groups will be set up as the raid leader sees fit, not by what team you belong to.<br>
<br>
Even when it's not a guild raid, there will be many times when not everyone is available to be online. At those times, spots in the groups will be opened and filled by those needing groups that want to RvR with us. <br>
<br>
Lower levels in high level groups are ok, but the enemy goes after the ones that con lower to them all the time. Constantly forcing your group to try and rescue you from dead. Can be trouble, but something I'm willing to deal with if someone wants to come along to see the frontiers and RvR. <br>
