A few of us gathered together and exchanged tales as ye may know. I scribed them and here they are. I ehhhh......lost the scribings of the fight. No it wasnt because I did not want ye all tae see the beat...I mean, ehhh, Have fun reading!<br><br>ooc Lanadena, would you edit this first part? I missed the begining of your story. Delete this message once your done<br><br>Hrrestan peers intently into his stein.<br>Lanadena says, 'Before too long, the wood elves heard some noises from the bundle. Seeing that the Teir'dal were no where to be seen, they investigated and found a Teir'dal infant.<br>Hrrestan pours another ale into his mug.<br>Lanadena says, 'The couple could not leave the infant there alone, even if it was a Teir'dal.'<br>Lechel blinks.<br>Lanadena says, 'So they took the infant and named her Nilinya. They went back to the city of Kelethin and removed their belongings.'<br>Ballapeen says, 'Heh so the stinking inky couldnt take em'<br>Lanadena says, 'They lived in exile with Nilinya and their daughter Kinieya.'<br>You agree with Ballapeen.<br>Hrrestan says, 'Shush, I'm listening'<br>Lanadena says, 'Nilinya grew up worshipping Tunare, as that is who her parents worshipped.'<br>Hrrestan ponders what a Teir'Dal is .<br>Lechel scowls.<br>Lanadena says, 'Kinieya treated Nilinya as though she had been a sister that came from her parents naturally, and wasn't someone that had been thrown away.'<br>You say, 'Tier'dal, Drow, Dark Elf. All these names are theirs'<br>Lanadena says, 'When it came time for Nilinya to venture on her own, she was in for a rude awakening.'<br>Hrrestan whispers quietly Ahhh.<br>Hrrestan thanks Lechel.<br>Lanadena says, 'She was able to command the dead, and all of the light races seemed to fear her, and the Teir'dal shunned her, for they could not understand why she worshipped Tunare as she did.'<br>Lanadena shakes her head sadly.<br>Selvin cries.<br>Ballapeen chokes on his drink as he hears tha <br>Lanadena says, 'Not so long ago, there was a battle between the Teir'dals and the humans. Do any of ye remember that?'<br>Lanadena looks around.<br>Lechel shakes his head.<br>Hrrestan shakes his head.<br>Selvin nods.<br>You say, 'I have heard of it though'<br>Hrrestan says, 'No, I was . removed .'<br>Hrrestan points to the moon.<br>Selvin says, 'A bloody day that served the lords of the dead well'<br>Lanadena says, 'During that battle, Nilinya fought with the humans. A most unusual action, it would seem, unless ye knew her and knew of her love of Tunare.'<br>Lanadena looks into her stein.<br>Crakken tells the guild, 'Hehe'<br>Lanadena says, 'She fought bravely that day.'<br>Ballapeen pops a cork and pours Lana another one.<br>Lanadena says, 'And saved many humans'<br>Lanadena thanks Ballapeen.<br>Lanadena says, 'She was officially recognized by the Gods that day for her bravery and valor. So if ye see Nilinya in the realm, do not distrust her. She is a good soul.'<br>Lanadena cheers.<br>Selvin cheers.<br>Lanadena says, 'I heard that tale from Kinieya, her sister, and from her.'<br>Ravnanger thanks Ballapeen heartily.<br>Lanadena says, 'Very good people, they are.'<br>Ravnanger says, 'Nurture Vs Nature .'<br>Lanadena says, 'If ye didn't like that tale, I'll take you on in the Arena!'<br>Ravnanger shakes his head.<br>Ravnanger says, 'Me?'<br>Lanadena says, 'Anyone of you!'<br>You say, 'It was a good story...'<br>Lanadena giggles.<br>Ravnanger smiles.<br>You beam a smile at Lanadena.<br>Ravnanger says, 'That it was'<br>Ballapeen says, 'Yes you Ra '<br>Selvin agrees with Lanadena.<br>Lanadena says, 'Would someone else like to tell the next one?'<br><br>Ballapeen says, 'Ever hear the tale of the brave little druid?'<br>Lanadena says, 'No, Ballapeen, I haven't'<br>Lanadena takes a seat.<br>You say, 'Nay, tell us'<br>Ballapeen says, 'Once not long ago there was this brave little wood elf druid who walked the land. He feared no creature of the woods for he was brave and powerful. One day he heard of a dreaded creature called an Owlbear neither bear nor owl but both.He decided that he must hunt this owlbear and add its head to his wall<br>Lanadena says, 'To his wall!'<br>You say, 'To his trophy wall!'<br>Ballapeen says, 'He travelled long and far untill he reached that place where the owl bear lives. He waited in hiding until he spotted one the meanest nastiest looking thing he had ever seen. He waited until the time was right and he jumped from the bush's and attacked. Long the battle raged back and forth no one was sure who would win'<br>Lechel leans fowards in anticipation.<br>Ballapeen says, 'Until '<br>You gasp at Ballapeen in astonishment.<br>Lanadena smiles at what might come next.<br>You say, 'Until?!<br>Ballapeen says, 'Something came over the owlbear a look that the young druid had never seen before. And then..<br>Braitha is disappointed that she missed the begining of this story.<br>Ballapeen says, 'The owlbear laid the biggest wettest kiss on the druid he had ever had. At first he was grossed out'<br>Lechel rolls in mid air laughing.<br>Braitha chuckles at Ballapeen.<br>Lanadena chuckles.<br>Ballapeen says, 'Then he thought &quot;Heh a bear ( you know what they say about druids)&quot;'<br>Lanadena scratches her head.<br>Ballapeen says, 'Then he thought &quot;Oh know what will the little elm and the sapling think?(you know what they say about wood elfs)&quot;'<br>Lechel blinks.<br>Ballapeen says, 'With a burst of strength he did know he had, he broke the beasts hold and fled the land'<br>Lanadena roars with laughter.<br>Braitha laughs heartily.<br>Ballapeen says, 'It is said that when the moon is right on a quiet night you can he a lone owlbear calling for her lost love'<br>You laugh.<br>Braitha laughs.<br>Ballapeen says, 'That the tale of the brave little druid'<br>You cheer at Ballapeen.<br>Braitha cheers at Ballapeen.<br>Braitha leans back and begins cleaning some of the grime off her armor. Sarnak blood stains, badly.<br><br>You say, it all started with me exiting the vile lair of BlackBurrow, only tae discover something in Qeynos Hills was not right'<br> Lanadena takes a seat.<br>You say, 'There seemed tae be a massive amount of undead, and stronger than had ever visited those beautiful hills before. My attention was caught however, by the loud wailings of an abnormally sized gnome at the Qeynos gates. While many of my equals stayed behind tae fight the undead,I went tae investigate the gnome. After calling many friends and other strong warriors, the gnome told us that his wife had been snatched from him by a horrible monster'<br>Lanadena bares her teeth at the mention of a horrible monster.<br>You say, 'He led us tae the docks in Toxullia Forest. When we reached them, we divided inta groups and it was clear that I was the youngest there by a great many seasons. <br>After setting off in a small boat, the gnome screamed in terror and jumped off the boat, swimming like mad towards the shore'<br>Lanadena spits out her drink.<br>Lanadena laughs at at gnome swimming like mad.<br>You say, 'We started tae hear strange noises when suddenly a gigantic serpent burst from the water infront of us'<br>Ristou says, 'A kraken I bet.'<br>Braitha must step away and attend to her wee ones.<br>Lanadena nods at Braitha.<br>You say, 'Fortunatly I was in the back of the boat, but at least one of my companions was devoured'<br>You say, 'Nae, a serpent. Thank the gods it was nae a kraken, we all would have perished'<br>You say, 'After being persued back tae shore, many strong warriors began tae fight with it, only tae proclaim that it was more powerful than any mortal in Norrath could ever be. Needless tae say, I kept my distance after the encounter in the boat. I kept my distance until I noticed many brave warriors were falling. I put my fears behind me and lept inta battle! I am sorry tae say that I was only able tae damage the creature a few times, but it seemed tae make him angry enough tae turn on me. The gods intervined so that even though life began tae flow from me, I did nae perish. After a hard fought battle, we defeated the monster'<br>Lanadena cheers.<br>You say, 'Oddly enough, that was nae the monster and everyone set off tae the Isle of Kerra'<br>Lanadena laughs.<br>You say, 'Unfortunatly I got there too late tae engage the monster, but I remember cresting the hill only tae see the largest ape ever. After a few moments it was slain and the gnomes were reunited. Everyone was properly rewarded, and although I declined a reward from the gnomes, my actions did nae go unnoticed. Many strong fighters congratulated me and even presented me with armor wich was wonderful'<br>You say, 'Ehhh'<br>You say, 'The End?'<br>You say, 'A tad anti-climatic, but a true story nontheless'<br>You chuckle.<br>Lanadena claps.<br>You bow.<br><br> Ristou says, 'I have a short tale. A feat of strength and my name is simply what it is. In my travels I once ventured into a land called the Frontier.'<br>Lanadena rubs her hands in anticpation.<br>Twas, full of mountains and forests thick as a Barbarians arm'<br>You smile.<br>Ristou says, 'I had to be quick because this land is home of many Giants; and even though they may be slow, if they catch you,you will become their dinner. While exploring, I heard shout from a group of fellow adventurers. A powerful group. They wore the crest of the Lycans of Legend. They were short in stature; much like Ballapeen here,but very strong'<br>You chuckle.<br>Lanadena smiles and takes a sip of her brew.<br>Ristou says, 'They had discovered the fortress of the Giants. With walls as high as the mountains. Much treasure was said to be there , and this band of Legends&quot; was going to raid the fort for all its gold. <br>You cheer.<br>Ristou says, 'Well, always looking for something new to sing about , I asked if I could tag along.<br>Lechel agrees with Ristou's decision'<br>Ristou says, 'They frowned their faces and said that I would be of no use and to stay back. Perhaps they would let me count their bounty.<br>Lanadena scowls.<br>Lechel folds his arms.<br>Ristou says, 'Being curious though, I followed them ever so closely. I have songs that allow me to sneak anywhere. Well, once this band got through the gate, it was if Lavastorm had erupted. Giants came from all over the fort to defend their treasure. The legends&quot; banded close to a wall to protect their backs and began to swing with all their might The Giants kept coming in wave after wave, their fists making sounds like thunder as they hit the ground or a target. I watched as a legend&quot; fell; and the others looked death straight in the face. Not knowing any better, I reached behind me and grabbed my horn and ran as quickly as I could toward the first giant I saw.<br>Lanadena gasps at Ristou in astonishment.<br>Lechel gives Ristou an admiring look.<br>Ristou says, 'I was not afraid however, because I knew the giant would not be able to resist my sweet song.<br>Braitha leans forward.<br>Ristou says, 'And true, The giant began to swoon at the music coming from my horn. The giant begged me to command it .'<br>You smile.<br>Ristou says, 'I whispered to it to aid the dying band of adventures, fighting its own brothers at my will. It turned and rushed into the wave of giants headlong, tossing and throwing them to and forth.<br>Lanadena cheers.<br>Ristou says, 'The band of legends&quot; saw this and stopped swinning to their amazement. They could not imagine the power that beuaty and music can have. The giant fought bravely , but soon died to its kind. Another though took its place as my slave, and another, till all laid in a pile at teh entrance to their own fort'<br>Lanadena imagines a pile of giant corpses and grins.<br>You grin evilly.<br>Ristou says, 'The legends&quot; picked up their fallen comrade and followed me out of the fort. All the time questioning how such things could be. They thanked me and we went our separate ways, but their adventure made for a good story.'<br>Ristou says, 'Dont ya think?'<br>You agree with Ristou.<br>Lanadena says, 'Aye, Ristou'<br>You say, 'Good tale!!'<br>You cheer at Ristou.<br>Ristou says, 'Thank you very much. It was just a lil something.'<br>Ristou thanks everyone.<br>You say, 'Well told Ristou'<br><br>Lanadena smiles and takes a seat.<br>Braitha says, 'Hail! Ahh well this tell beging in the foul Lake of Ill Omen. I had met up with The Twins, Immarrana and Immunu, the Vah'shir Loynu, and the fair Yasheira. We has hear tell of a Sarnak uprising and aimed to put a stop to it. In stealth we headed to their fort, and found a small alcove in which to bring them to their deaths. I was asked to hunt prey for our small party. Using the tracking senses Tunare blesses me with I was able to find a few of the foul beasts. The night wore on and we ventured deeper in to their stronghold, when suddenly we came upon a meeting of the beasts with their Most High Chancellor.<br>You gasp in astonishment<br>Braitha says, 'Soon we were swarmed by the villians'<br>Hrrestan shudders.<br>Braitha says, 'We fought unitl our magiks were delted and our strength gone.'<br>Lanadena shivers thinking of all those Sarnaks.<br>Braitha says, 'Calling on Tunare I was able to gather enough magiks to fade our bodies from view. We sat there quivering praying to our seperate gods as our magik replenished itself. At a most inopurtune time my body returned to veiw'<br>Lanadena recognizes that situation.<br>Lechel recongnizes that situation.<br>Lechel thinks about Cabilis.<br>Lechel shudders.<br>Braitha says, 'Sarnaks again bombarded us from all sides,'<br>Hrrestan sympathizes with Braitha.<br>Braitha says, 'The Battle raged on for what seemed like hours '<br>Ristou twitches nervously <br>Braitha says, 'Until finnally the last Sarnak fell to our blades and magik, but, our battle was not yet over. From around the corner came the High Chanellor. Knowing full well that his power exceeded our own we gathered our gear, and ran. Upon reaching the border to the Frontier Mountains, we came upon a very wise, very powerful, Knight.<br>Lechel looks around for Zulthar.<br>Ristou says, 'Was he handsome?'<br>Lanadena says, 'And did he wear shining armor?'<br>Braitha says, 'The Knight took up his arms, and banished the Chancellor to the hells fron which he came!'<br>Braitha clears her throat.<br>Braitha says, 'Aye he was handsome '<br>Lechel crosses Zulthar off the list of potentials.<br>Lanadena smiles.<br>Braitha says, 'Though his armor could have used a polish'<br>Lanadena chuckles.<br>Hrrestan laughs.<br>Ristou says, 'Isnt that always how it is.'<br>Lechel looks at his armor and begins to clean it.<br>You say, 'No! Not always'<br>Lechel begins to clean faster.<br>Lanadena looks sadly at Lechel's armor.<br>Ristou says, 'Oh, Lechel, your armor is fine'<br>Hrrestan peers sideways at Ristou.<br>Lechel gives his armor one last swipe.<br>Ristou admires Hrrestan's boots from afar.<br>Braitha says, 'Unfortunately you all get to see me in my battle armor, I was unable to stop by the bank and pick up my clean set.'<br>You say, 'Ye have two sets of armor?!'<br>Hrrestan looks closely at the flecks of goblin blood dried onto his armor.<br>Lanadena says, 'Ye had a long way to travel.'<br>Braitha says, 'Nay I have three, but one is to be saved for a very special occaision and was a gift'<br>You gasp in astonishment.<br><br><br>&lt;ooc, I had to put this in&gt;<br><br>Lechel examines Lechel's dress.<br>You say, 'AGH!'<br>You say, 'AGH!'<br>Lanadena swings her head.<br>Hrrestan chuckles at Lechel.<br>Lechel examines Lanadena's dress.<br>Lanadena says, 'Ye wear a dress, Lechel?'<br>You say, 'Only under my armor'<br>Hrrestan inspects Lechel's dress .<br>You say, 'And only on week days'<br>Lanadena chuckles at Lechel.<br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub5.ezboard.com/ftheclanmacleargeneral.showPrevMessage?topicID=1616.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub5.ezboard.com/ftheclanmacleargeneral.showNextMessage?topicID=1616.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub5.ezboard.com/ftheclanmacleargeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1616.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/traditional/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub5.ezboard.com/ftheclanmacleargeneral.emailToFriend?topicID=1616.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub5.ezboard.com/ftheclanmacleargeneral.threadControl?topicID=1616.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/traditional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub5.ezboard.com/ftheclanmacleargeneral.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1616.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub5.ezboard.com/ftheclanmacleargeneral.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1616.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub5.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="theclanmacleargeneral">The Great Hall<option value="theclanmaclearfrm8">Inner Court<option value="theclanmaclearfrm6">Events<option value="theclanmaclearfrm5">Provisioner's Square<option value="theclanmaclearfrm4">Chief's Council Chambers<option value="theclanmaclearfrm7">Senate Chambers<option value="theclanmaclearfrm10">Council Hall of Midgard<option value="theclanmaclearfrm9">The Great Hall of Midgard<option value="theclanmaclearfrm12">Inner Circle of Midgard<option value="theclanmaclearfrm11">Crafter's hall<option value="theclanmaclearfrm15">Applicants to Siol Lear<option value="theclanmaclearfrm16">Tales From The Great Hall<option value="theclanmaclearfrm18">Siol Lear Kin Petitioners<option value="theclanmaclearfrm19">NWN and Other Lands of Lear</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#330000>- </font><a href=http://pub5.ezboard.com/btheclanmaclear>The Clan MacLear</a><font color=#330000> - </font><a href=http://pub5.ezboard.com/ftheclanmacleargeneral>The Great Hall</a> <font color=#330000> - </font><a href="http://www.clanmaclear.com">The Clan MacLear Homepage</a><font color=#330000> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.9<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
